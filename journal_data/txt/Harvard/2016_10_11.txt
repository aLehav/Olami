After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Last week, Harvard welcomed Anna Deavere Smith after her successful run at the American Repertory Theater with the one-woman show “Notes From the Field: Doing Time in Education.” Presented by the Mahindra Humanities Center, the fifth Rita E. Hauser Forum for the Arts, entitled “Radical Hospitality,” drew a large crowd to Sanders Theatre on Wednesday evening.
University President Drew G. Faust introduced Smith by recalling the impact Smith made on the arts at Harvard as a Bunting Institute fellow at Radcliffe in 1992. She then welcomed the director of the Mahindras Humanities Center, Homi K. Bhabha. Both speakers alluded to broader political developments on campus and off. Bhabha, in his remarks to Faust, made reference to the first day of the Harvard University Dining Services strike, which was audible outside. “Nothing that happens in the wider world or on this campus ever affects your wit, your warmth or your hospitality,” he said. In his introduction of Smith, he also mentioned the current political climate. “The United States has an immensity, its eyes set on big things, big numbers, and big combovers,” Bhabha said, to laughter from the audience. “Anna Deavere Smith, meanwhile, provides a sharp contrast in scale. She stands before us as singular and unadorned.”
Smith’s talk, which included direct address to the audience as well as a one-woman staging of several acted anecdotes, pressed hard on issues of racial inequalities and religious discrimination. “We must finally learn to tolerate the presence of each other,” she said as the talk reached the thesis of “Radical Hospitality.”
Throughout the performance, Smith described her own experiences of receiving radical hospitality. “Hospitality is not making dinner,” she said. “It’s how you place yourself in relationships.” She also spoke about the present inequities within the arts, noting that the way art is created and displayed is unfair. “The ecosystem of opportunity is unjust,” Smith said. “Inequality abounds.”
She quoted the average compensation for leaders in nonprofit theatres, garnering audible gasps from the audience when she cited the highest recorded payment in nonprofit theatres as being $608,000, while leaders of African American theatres made at most $110,000. That figure, she added, reached just $88,000 for Latino companies. “To whom is hospitality extended?” Smith asked.
Many attendees responded positively to the performance. Dylan J. Goodman, who works for a labor union, came from Worcester, Mass. to hear Smith speak. “I think that Anna Deavere Smith takes her audience on a journey into hurt while also giving us the potential to have redemption,” he said. “She gives the audience an opportunity to have these very difficult conversations and turn feelings of anger or guilt into action.”
Michael S. Gomez, a graduate student at the A.R.T., was similarly complimentary. “I saw [Smith’s] show when she was performing with the A.R.T., and so getting to hear her thoughts on what inspires her and gets her brain thinking about social issues was really fascinating. I thought it was very moving, because it really showed how simple, everyday things can have greater repercussions,” he said.
Smith seemed to command the attention of the crowd gathered in Sanders Theater almost effortlessly: Throughout the performance, there were moments of such silence that a pin drop could have been heard. She ended her lecture with a few choice words of advice for her audience. “Confidence is overrated. Give doubt a try,” she said. “Doubt is radical hospitality. Empathy is radical hospitality.”

Do moral boundaries collapse when there are no consequences?
The series premiere of “Westworld” poses this discomforting question as it sets the stage for a Western-themed amusement park of the same name, in which its guests can live without facing repercussions for their actions, however egregious they may be. Their hosts, eerily human androids, are programmed to follow a script with slight alterations based on interactions with “newcomers,” namely the actual people, and are the targets for inconsequential sex and murder. These hosts live the same routine every day and are thus subject to the greed and violence of their guests, who can harm but not be harmed.
The programmers of Westworld attempt to make the hosts seem even more human (even despite one curious British employee who objects, “Do you want to think that your husband is really fucking that beautiful girl, or that you really just shot someone?”). They realize, however, that the most recent update has caused a widespread glitch: From strained facial expressions to stroke-like outbursts, the androids are not staying within their scripts. Some even start to gain consciousness, threatening to thwart the complete control the programmers have over their world. The chaos that ensues thereafter—more robo-bloodshed than the calculated amount, a bank robbery, and the cessation of an entire scene when one robot goes rogue—sets the stage for a promising season of moral dilemmas, rich and borderline immoral patrons, and lots of robot versus human action.
This thriller, based on the 1973 Michael Crichton movie of the same name, is more than the typical sci-fi dystopia: It taps into computer cognizance and human morality while exploring human desires unbound by moral constraints (Does sex with robots count as necrophilia? Apparently in Westworld, it doesn’t matter.) Gone is the pointless and cliché post-apocalyptic dystopia; “Westworld” demands not only to be seen but scrutinized.
Thanks to an acclaimed cast of actors and an innovative set of producers and designers, “Westworld” is gorgeous. The landscape is almost too beautiful to be true (but is perfectly fitting for an amusement park), the actors are able to switch from playing emotionless robots to portraying robots doing near-flawless imitations of humans in milliseconds, and the high-tech machinery realistically captures a futuristic world. Moreover, Crichton’s original decision to pair several seemingly discordant elements works in the show’s favor to create an unsettling and surprise-filled multi-layered plot. The juxtaposition of robots in the Wild West, gunshots but no actual death, and unfiltered nudity amongst violence creates a fine line between reality and fantasy: fantasies that are too good to be real, and realities that have no place in a land of fantasy.

On Oct. 4, renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas spoke about four of his current overseas design projects at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Born in 1944, the Rotterdam visionary has created some of the most acclaimed and controversial architecture of the last four decades. Currently, Koolhaas is a professor of the practice of Architecture and Urban Design at the GSD. As crowds of students, professors, and art lovers gathered at the GSD’s Gund Theater to hear him speak, there was a tangible excitement.
Koolhaas opened the talk with a discussion of the state of his native Europe. As one of the designers of a possible new flag for the EU in 2002, Koolhaas has had the opportunity to attend many summits and referendums discussing the future of the organization. “There is a tendency for those over 50 to worry and those under 50 not to care,” Koolhaas said. From here, Koolhaas transitioned into talking about four recent or ongoing projects that he and his creative firm, Office for Metropolitan Architecture, have been involved in: the Taipei Performing Arts Center, the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow, the Qatar National Library in Doha, and the Prada Foundation in Milan.
For each building, Koolhaas detailed his and his partners’ visions, discussing their inspiration and the common themes of each building’s architecture. With the Taipei Performing Arts Center, Koolhaas envisioned three theaters in a single building that would be centrally located above and around street life. In fact, the shape of the building was inspired by a deep-dish pan found in typical Cantonese street restaurant. As a picture of this bowl flashed across the projector, the audience burst into laughter. Local screenplay writer Mollie D. Miller, who attended the lecture, later commented on Koolhaas’s unusual source of inspiration. “The whole lecture was worth it for me because of the picture of the bowl of soup. That was fabulous! Who would look at a bowl of soup and say: ‘Oh my God! I can put three theaters and connect them all!’” she said.
For the Garage Museum building, Koolhaas remodeled a previously standing Soviet building, a restaurant that he had once visited on a trip in 1967 and that had become a ruin more than two decades ago. “I was astonished to see, against expectation, how luxurious or how generous Soviet architecture even at that late point could be,” he said. The idea of this building was to resurrect the generosity that Soviet architecture embodied with minimal modification, while at the same time lending the building a sense of modernity. The solution was to use a skin of polycarbonate that not only preserved some of the original building but also exposed the functional aspects of the building as decoration.
The National Library in Doha is located within the confines of Education City, an ambitious project composed of different universities. Koolhaas created a building from two mirroring concave shapes of white concrete with the entrance placed in the middle. “Therefore, you are surrounded by this amphitheater of books that enables you in one glance to see everything and every book that is in the library. [It is] a direct invitation to reading,” he said. Koolhaas explained that he intended the modernity and flooding daylight to create a space that would do justice to Qatar’s long history of literacy.
Returning to European issues, Koolhaas ended his talk with a discussion of the Prada Foundation. “The Prada Foundation tries to make sense of the new Europe,” he said. Built on the periphery of an old industrial region, Koolhaas and his team created a creative space amidst an industrial one. “It creates a kind of metaphor of Europe,” he said. “It is also very ancient and decrepit but capable of genuine invention.” One of the buildings in this complex uses aluminum mirrors to create a hardcore modernity amidst the antiquity, while another is covered in gold to restore what Koolhaas has termed “aura.” Master of Architecture student Marysol Riva Brita, who described herself as an avid lover of Koolhaas’s work, said that she felt inspired by his talk not just because of what he has produced, but also because of what he represents in the world of design. “He has this role in which he claims bigger agency for design,” she said.
Travis Dagenais, communications manager at the GSD, also noted the interdisciplinary nature of Koolhaas’s work and thought. “I appreciate that Rem Koolhaas combined insight from across disciplines and some of his recent and current projects to give us a fusion of architecture, design and culture in the current moment,” he said. And judging from the many raised hands during his question and answer session, Koolhaas found an eager audience for those ideas  Tuesday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rae Sremmurd (Is that even how you spell their name?) have emerged from hibernation with their most recent music video for their single, “Black Beatles.” It follows a series of amusingly successful singles from their first studio album, “SremmLife” (Is that even spelled correctly?). It was an album that begged the following questions: Did anyone ever come and get the girl who was acting like a stripper (“Come Get Her”); do Rae Sremmurd ever find their type (“No Type”); and is the last m in “SremmLife” silent?
Their most recent single is a far more serious affair. On the surface, it appears to be an aching polemic that powerfully places their current musical success within the larger historical context of the Beatles, indicating that they, as black artists, have managed to carve out a space within the American—nay, international—musical imagination that was formerly reserved for white artists. However, underneath that exterior is a far more moving message about the marauding horrors of eyesight loss: A PSA for those with challenged eyesight.
Its opening shot contains two contrasting images, the first of which is a marquee with the words “Black Beatles.” Ignore that sign. Below it—pay attention, this is absolutely critical—is an illuminated sign that reads “Elite Parking Systems,” adjacent to an outline of the United States. With black letters on a white sign—none of the letters touch the outline of the United States—it symbolizes the difficult position that Rae Sremmmurd imagines American blacks occupying in the periphery of American culture. However, the shot quickly develops to zoom in on the “Black Beatles” sign and away from the critical “Elite Parking Systems” sign. This is strikingly similar to the way in which the visually impaired may have problems seeing the whole of an image. The connection cannot be ignored: As our critical sign moves out of the camera frame with mechanical efficiency, it represents the way in which the healthcare system mechanically disenfranchises the visually impaired.
Continuing the theme, the rest of “Black Beatles”—with some notable exceptions, the importance of which will be lovingly elucidated—is edited to make each image appear faded. This is no mere gimmick. Instead, it is Rae Sremmmmurd’s attempt to place the viewer in a position of empathy with the visually impaired. The contents of each shot are slightly obscured (Is that the component parts of Rae Sremmmmmurd running across a crowded highway or mere impersonators?) so that Rae Sremurd allow for the difficulties of the visually challenged to be understood by all. The visuals reduce the acoustic element of the music video into a melodic chant: “Glasses for one. Glasses for all.”
Nevertheless, a brief moment of clarity occurs at 1:18, when a man throws a guitar at a television in a shot with perfect video quality. It is a symbol that cannot go unnoticed: The revolution for the visually impaired will not be televised (a delightful rejection of malicious irony). Instead, it finds itself at our American doorstep in musical form. The importance of this revolutionary imagery is magnified by its repetition in a nearly identical scene at 4:23, allowing these images to serve as a framing device for the video.
A revolution for what? Free eye care for all. Note the eyewear above the ice cream cone tattooed on the face of Gucci Mane, otherwise known as La Flare, Guwop, or the prodigious feature on “Black Beatles.” The eyewear is covered in Christian crosses, a symbol that eyesight and the lack thereof is a gift given by God. It is an invocation for God to lift the burden of bad eyesight. It is as if Mane is saying: Lift the burden of the crosses from my eyes as you lifted the burden of the cross from Jesus. Only then does it become even more apparent that the song title—and its video’s implications of Rae Sremmurd (Wait, is that spelled correctly?) being the black reincarnation of the Beatles—are just a product of the viewer’s own bad eyesight.

“As a female actor, I really like playing kings and warriors—Macbeth would be a dream role for me—and I’ve never had directors let me read for any of these roles. And I thought, why not?” Such acting experience guided Kier W. Zimmerman ’19, an inactive Crimson news editor, to direct a gender-blind production of “Macbeth,” running Oct. 13 to 16 in the Agassiz Theater under the aegis of the Hyperion Shakespeare Company.
Macbeth, in his political and psychological quest for power, thus not only faces a series of moral dilemmas following the witches’ prophecy that he is to become the next King of Scotland; he, along with the audience, will face questions about the role of gender in each plot point. With Malcolm and Banquo cast as women, the audience now must contemplate seemingly simple plot points. “Why does Banquo get passed up for the promotion?” Zimmerman says. “Is it a gender thing?”
“I operate under the assumption that with these roles [being cast gender-blind], they dig much deeper into humanity,” she says. “It matters more that a human is playing a role more than whether a man or a woman is playing it.” The characters’ gender pronouns remain unchanged, and the actresses playing Banquo and Malcolm do not cross-dress.
Ezra Feldman, a Ph.D. student in English who will play Duncan, concurs that the unconventional casting raises some of the stakes. “It puts on a lot of pressure of what it means to be a man,” he says.
But even with this unique approach to direction, this “Macbeth” will try to speak for itself: Rather than the flashiness that often comes with contemporary productions of Shakespeare, simplicity, accessibility, and clarity are key in this minimalist production.
“I don't believe that Shakespeare needs to be set in the 1970s or in the 1770s. I think his stories ring true no matter the time or the place. So what we’re doing with this play is very minimalist, without many nods to where we are and when,” Zimmerman says.
That is not to say that this production will not surprise or diverge from tradition: With an actor who breaks the fourth wall with humor, a focus on choreography and movement, and a twist on the role of the infamous witches, it will not be the typical classical theater experience.
Still, the thrust of the production is clear, according to Lindsay McAuliffe ’20, who is playing Lady MacBeth. “Kier’s really underscoring that gender does not determine the success of a character,” she says.

Margaret Atwood is a contemporary author from Canada, known for her novels and her environmental activism. William Shakespeare is an English playwright from the Elizabethan Era, known as England’s national poet. Despite the temporal and geographical differences between them, the two literarily meet in Margaret Atwood’s “Hag-Seed,” a retelling of Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.” The reworking features prison inmates in its cast and a crazy, rejected theater director as its star. While the premise seems promising, “Hag-Seed” fails to deliver, overloading the novel with too many useless details and not enough emotional substance.
“Hag-Seed” follows Felix, an artistic director at the Makeshiweg Theater Festival, who goes mad after his three-year-old daughter—Miranda—dies of meningitis. After that, Felix throws himself into his work, trying to recreate “The Tempest” with a recasted Miranda as the star. However, after his directions become a little too crazy (he tries to construct a cape out of stuffed animal skin), he is fired from his job. From there, he moves to the countryside, changes his name, and starts working at a local prison, teaching theater to inmates. But his quest to put on Miranda’s play and enact revenge on the people who got him fired is far from over.
Atwood’s writing style is acutely distinct but ends up doing more harm than good. She incorporates details into every action her characters take, whether they are admiring the knitted gowns of Disney dolls, shopping for costumes for a retelling of “The Tempest,” or slipping cigarettes into potato chip bags, which feels immersive at first. Add detailed style to the intense level of focalization, and readers are put right into Felix’s head— right where the madness is. As consuming they can be, however, the details become almost unnecessary. Atwood describes in over-meticulous detail the process Felix goes through to put on a swimming cap: “He views and rejects several bathing caps: one with daisies, one with a pattern of pink roses on aqua, one with waterproof bows.” Like many other scenes, the description feels useless and a little indulgent, especially as it accumulates with other moments. The book would be better off keeping the scenes simple, like when the novel describes Miranda’s “pathetically small coffin.” Those three words have more impact than they would if they were an entire paragraph filled with descriptions of the coffin. Its poignancy draws from its simplicity, which would be helpful in the case of “Hag-Seed.” “Hag-Seed” promises to deliver action, as its prologue literally starts with gunfire. But all the action of the plot is bogged down by details, making the reading more tedious than exciting.
Perhaps one could argue that the overloading of details is meant to drive home the point that Felix is mad. The plot seems to hinge on his madness. Crazy action after crazy action—like getting off the radar, changing his name, and stalking a person for several years—seems to result only from the fact that Felix is a once-successful man driven mad by the untimely death of his daughter. But that seems like too sparse an explanation. Felix’s madness does not seem like it has enough justification to be believable. Yes, it is sad that his daughter died, but his love for his daughter often seems ingenuine. He describes in detail what his daughter looked like (“So perfect, her fingers, her toes, her eyes! Such a delight!”) and briefly talks about her personality. But most of his unsettling fixation seems to come from her appearance, as he struggles to find a Miranda that will satisfy her part look-wise: “With her body type—slender, wiry—she could still get away with Miranda. Supposing she hadn’t bloated.” Focusing on Miranda’s looks does not allow for any emotional empathy, which would allow Atwood’s readers to share Felix’s pain and better understand his behavior.
Speaking of Miranda, her actress—Marie-Anne—also seems to have no purpose, much like the detailed writing style. She seems more like a plot device, which is frustrating since Marie-Anne is one of the main characters. She lacks emotional depth, and she seems virtually perfect. Marie-Anne knows how to knit, and the prison guards love her. She even gets the guy at the end of the day. Marie-Anne is a Mary Sue, and her only function it seems, is to serve Felix—to give him the plot he needs to get on with his play, and thus to get on with his life. Marie-Anne is one of the only female characters in the book, and despite the important role she plays, she has no substance, which is entirely disappointing to a reader who wants fleshed-out female characters to identify with, or at least to make the book interesting.
“Hag-Seed,” then, doesn’t have quite the emotional impact that it should. Some quirks—prisoners learning the art of theater and a man kicked out of his role in the arts and left to go stir-crazy over his daughter’s death—can be engaging on the surface but don’t make for book that will last. While “Hag-Seed” is a book that’s great for a quick read, it doesn’t deliver the punches that the premises promise, making it an all-around mediocre book.

Darcy James Argue’s band Secret Society recently released “Real Enemies,” an album that explores all manner of American conspiracy theories, from Area 51 to the CIA-Contra cocaine trafficking ring. The album, originally a performance project, consists of 13 tracks with titles such as “Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars” and “Trust No One.” Heavily influenced by John Coltrane’s jazz masterpiece “Love Supreme,” the saxophone-heavy album develops the theme of conspiracy with unique instrumentation and fervent rhythms. The album decenters the listening experience by eschewing the traditional key-based system for Schoenberg’s twelve-tone technique, a musical invention that ensures that no one note is dominant.
The album begins and ends with two identically titled tracks: “You Are Here.” Upon actually listening to the tracks, one realizes that they are two completely different pieces, couched in twin titles that bookend James’s album with an innocent conspiracy. Another track, “Never a Straight Answer,” begins with a Hitchcockian flair, then continues into a digital-sounding melodic twinkle that grows more and more intricate. Later, a saxophone joins the fray, and the resulting interplay is a complex tangle of musical threads that mirrors the inscrutability of conspiracies.
“Dark Alliance” is a satisfying, disco-like track that is one of the best on the album. Its intricate rhythms and shifting tempo make excellent use of the disorienting nature of the twelve-tone system. “Casus Belli” is another gem, incorporating lively dance rhythms with jazz undertones to create a genuinely enjoyable listening experience. In “Crisis Control,” George H. W. Bush’s “New World Order” speech is set to skeptical jazz—saxophones acting as musical scare quotes that question the true meaning of his words. As the fervor of the music increases, Bush’s words are repeated, this time in montage. The effect produced is a fascinating exploration of the political fervor inherent in the framework of “us versus them.”
Individual tracks often sound muddled, meandering without momentum until they morph into another almost identical track. The title track, “Real Enemies,” is one such example. Instead of being a strong track that encapsulates the themes of the album, “Real Enemies” weakens the musical intensity so carefully built up in previous tracks. Other times, tracks fall into a stale rhythm, and many end up sounding like what Pink Panther and James Bond would listen to if they walked into a haunted house. Other than a general sense of creepiness that soon wears off after the second track, the album doesn’t attempt trip anything else on the emotional radar. “Real Enemies” portrays conspiracies as always sinister while omitting humour—think the Illuminati or UFOs.
Even with this single-minded focus on conspiracy theories, the themes of paranoia and the comforts of paradox do not emerge as strongly as one might expect. Titles such as “The Hidden Hand,” “Casus Belli,” and “Who Do You Trust?” are much too generic to lend any real historical depth. While the album incorporates interesting historical sound bites such as presidential speeches, these excerpts are not always convincingly incorporated. Despite its weaknesses, however, the album remains a strong foray into a fascinating subject matter. Its hazy rhythmic strokes are a musical version of Toulouse-Latrec’s “The Hangover”: a society so drunk on facts that a little conspiracy is all that is needed to make sense of everything.

“Do You Need My Love” is the second single from singer Weyes Blood’s sophomore album, “Front Row Seat to Earth.” For an artist whose stage name is derived from Flannery O’Connor’s Southern Gothic writing, Blood’s new single, “Do You Need My Love,” hinges on the lyrically abstract, skirting concrete visual images. Instead, these are complicated, intangible feelings, articulated simply: “Tired of feeling so bad / The world that I knew just fell through / And left me outside.”
That feeling of being “left outside” punctuates the whole song. “Do you need me the way I need you?” she croons in a desperate request for reciprocated love, backed by choral vocals, a celestial synth track, moody piano, and syncopated drumbeats. This instrumentation, coupled with Blood’s timeless voice, makes for a retro ’70s vibe that pairs well with a classically lovelorn theme. In a haunting plea for candor, her voice reverberates: “Let’s be true for a change,” she begs. There’s a sense of frustration at the interiority of love, how it’s only expressed internally; love is not chocolates and roses but “the pain of what’s gone.” Excluded from her own love story, Blood becomes intensely confessional in a melodically dissonant bridge: “Everyone who knows me / Knows I'm crazy for loving you, baby / Do you need me like I need you? / Tell me what I can do.”
“Do You Need My Love” is not the newest, infectiously catchy earworm. But if you’re searching for a wistful ballad with time-traveling capacities, Blood’s new single will transport you with six rapturous minutes of ’70s piano and brooding love.

There exists a type of poem that, by definition, comprises of other people’s poems. The cento pirates lines from various texts, shakes them up like dice, and rolls them out to produce a new work.
T.S. Eliot wasn’t aiming to create a cento when he sat down to write “The Wasteland,” but he also wasn’t opposed to the idea of reiteration via “allusion, quotation, … and ventriloquism.” Eliot talked openly about his endorsement of plagiarism, not much unlike a bank robber handing over some cash for a venti latte and informing the baristas of his unlawful source. He even leaned over the counter and suggested that they adopt his methodology: “Good writers borrow. Great writers steal!”
Eliot was unabashed about his thieving tendencies. But though he was more explicit than most, he was only one of many. Poems rattle with echoes; the plagiarism of poetry stretches back almost as far as poetry itself. Virgil’s ancient “Aeneid” can be found in dozens of subsequent hits, including Dante’s “Divine Comedy.” William Wordsworth wrote an autobiographical “Prelude” that mimics Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” which mimics the story of Adam and Eve, which was originally transmitted orally. Bob Dylan’s song “Barbara Allen” is pulled from an anonymous ballad poem written sometime around the 16th century; the opening of “When You Are Old” by Yeats is in fact a variation of a French sonnet; and Hemingway stole the title of “For Whom the Bell Tolls” from poet John Donne, whose best-known line, poor thing, is instead frequently accredited to Hemingway.
This verbatim copying is blatant, and mostly unattributed. There is no footnote in the neo-Western movie title “No Country for Old Men” that mutters in our ear, “By the way, this line is originally from a Yeats poem.” Unlike in academia, plagiarism in poetry is intended to be found out. Poetic references are a boon to the art form, not a crime committed by the poet. If appropriated excerpts are to have an impact, the reader needs to be able to recognize the referenced sources and say, “Hey, I see what you did there.” This makes poetic references risky in their own way: If a reference goes over someone’s head, is the reference really there?
Poetry is not unique in in its reliance on previously said words. We live in a swamp of references, with a cultural toolkit that has not varied for a long time. A large portion of our songs consist of the same four chords. While new words occasionally wiggle their way into our dictionaries, our overall vocabulary remains largely unchanged. We have Roy G. Biv to paint with and 10 numerals with which to solve the physical universe. Our worldly lexicons are fairly fixed. You can’t help but wonder what was it like when everything was new. How did Socrates feel each morning when he put his feet on the floor in the morning, stretched, and contributed a shiny new philosophical theory? How about the person who spoke the first word? The first notes of music?

Hidden away in our ivory tower, it is so easy to shut out the real world that begins just feet away from Harvard’s gates. Most of us don’t even have televisions other than for recreational purposes, so there is no opportunity to casually watch the news. While some do subscribe to popular newspaper outlets, most students rely largely on our social media newsfeeds to decide what content we consume.
As amazing as this technology age is, being inundated with information can have its side effects. In one scroll down our screens, we not only consume the newest funny Vine or BuzzFeed video, but the deaths of black men and women caught on tape. Both types of videos go viral, and as a black person, unfortunately, both are relatable.
I’ve grown tired of reading the most ridiculous headlines about black people—regardless of age, gender, or culpability—doing everyday things and being killed for them. If I have to see one more post trying to differentiate Black Lives Matter from All Lives Matter—like we should ever have had to defend this statement in the first place—I may scream.
Walking on the red cobblestones that pave the sidewalks of campus is like being in another world—and I am split between the sense of awe I, at times, feel to be attending this university and the burden of pressure it gives me. Depending on the day, one emotional side wins over the other—at times due to what current events are dominating in the daily news. This may not be uncommon among the majority of Harvard students, but the experience of being a black Harvard student remains undeniably unique.
While I think many of us would love to just be regular young people, who worked hard to get into this school, our position here is a political statement in itself, and there is a long history informing that. In recognizing this, I think we often feel a sense of responsibility or obligation that leaves us torn. We try to just be carefree, fun-loving, and celebratory. Yet, there is a part of us that knows we must unfailingly regard ourselves with seriousness, weight, and drive to further some nebulous cause.
When a new case of police brutality ending in the death of a black person gains national attention, it affects the mood of the community here on campus. There are those who take to Facebook to rant, expressing their anger and pain, and those who bring it up in conversation among friends. Some just remain silent.
No matter how emotionally affected we may be by the news, though, we try to shake it off—putting on a brave face and a fake smile every time we step out of our rooms. But unlike broadcast news, which we can turn off and go about our day, any time we open our Facebook for a brief moment, we are hit with a new wave of articles, videos, and everyone and their mothers’ commentary.
It is almost impossible to keep up the facade in the face of that. Subconsciously, at first, but then purposely: I made the decision to unplug when all of this is going on. It is hard to avoid the new cases of police brutality and black death entirely, but it has become entirely too easy to disconnect, to go about my life as if it is not happening. I do not actively search out details, and I scroll past articles and viral videos.
I refuse to consume black death—in what seems like public executions—like it is the newest, popular television show.
There is such a thing as white privilege that allows many to navigate this world untouched by the carnage, but we black students also have a choice not to let these emotionally traumatizing moments distract us from our goals. It is a fine line to walk, especially since we are privileged to attend this institution. So, in some ways, it almost seems as if we are ignoring the problem—the termination of black lives. These are human beings, after all, but we are not the ones killing them.
For the sake of our emotional and mental health, we are allowed to take a break from the news, social media, or conversations with friends—and just be. We’re allowed to forget about the politics of it all, and regard ourselves as individuals outside of a world where skin color seems to automatically mean a death sentence.
This place is challenging enough as it is, so why not let it be some kind of safe haven—whatever that might mean? For me, it means burying myself in my work and taking advantage of every opportunity to better myself—because I know that choosing not to keep up with the latest death doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten or deny what is happening. It means keeping my mental well-being intact, while channeling my emotions as fuel to succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone loves Constance Wu. She has a sick, no-nonsense TV persona. She’s one of the few public figures who’ll cuss out the white kids saving China with a Tumblr-like vengeance. A couple of weeks ago she took a picture with her white boyfriend’s lips glued to her face, smiling like no one’s business. The yellow boys started out asking what she was doing with this “mediocre” Moby Dick. Someone made a Reddit page called “Constance Wu and her average white boyfriend.” The yellow boys got called out because men shouldn’t feel entitled to women’s bodies, or we live in 2016, or Wu really seems to be in love.
Love’s workings should be unrelated to those of politics. But at the same time, there’s nothing more political than deciding whom you mess with, whose experiences you take on as your own. It seems in every public context other than Asian-American activism, partnerships are factored unapologetically, essentially, into identity. Who did not point to Melania’s plagiarism as a display, also, of Trump’s inadequacy; her immigrant status as contradictory to his nativist rhetoric? Who does not view the Bill aspect to Clinton’s presidential run as significant, a contribution to her identity as an insider? We talk about the social significance of Michelle Obama’s skin color, darker than the president’s. There are sociologies and national histories and tropes that solely exist to define who cuffs you up, because there are white trophy wives to rich black men, skinny yellow boys to hallyu’d-up white girls, black girls to hip-hop posing yellow boys, and of course, white boys to yellow girls. There are forces beyond fluffiness and attraction that bring people together.
In some ways, the yellow boys are asking the same question as the rest of us: Is it ever possible to love an idea, a country, a cause, as deeply or completely or powerfully as you could love another human being?
For yellow females, it is simple to paint the white-boy-yellow-girl pairing as a place in which we are always, continually, and forever victims. We claim we are fetishized; we sing about misogyny. We say we are judged unfairly, because yes, love is not activism, sex is not an essay. But yellow fever doesn’t explain our complicity. Locking away the opinions of the people we represent is not calling someone out. In our models, we critique the opinions of everyone except for our own because our models are based on denial. We need to utilize a model of the world in which we have control over our bodies. Agency is a timely, weighted concept.
The backlash against Constance Wu’s boyfriend is not just, or even mostly, about Constance Wu. It is, instead, a response to seemingly continual proof that love is not possible without whiteness. It would be ignorant to deny that our community’s identity lies in the forces that bring a disproportionate amount of yellow men and women to white lovers. Even our love poetry contemplates whiteness, on how we can hate whiteness but love its people. Jenny Zhang asks, “How could I have loved these men who wanted a living China doll instead of a three-dimensional woman?” In a bone-hard personal essay, she concludes that it is possible to really love a fetishizer and to be really loved by one. Because to some extent, we are always, no matter the color of our lovers, imagining our partners wrong, buying into the illusion that convinces us of their worthiness. Because our racialized desire to be accepted is also a part of us, a want we can’t separate from our intangible needs. Ocean Vuong, who pleads to his partner, “Say autumn despite the green in your eyes,” will never stop writing poetry in which his small-Vietnamese-boyness does not surround his language, his desires. What does it mean if, in our poetry, a partner’s climax is equitable to surrender? What does it mean if we imagine ourselves next to Trevors who are “too fast & not enough” or who toss “panties in the lake for fun;” what if we really are “yellow & nearly nothing”? Yes, there are Asian-Asian couples as well: Helen Zia and Lia Shigemura, MC Jin and Carol Au-Yeung, Randall and Jae Suh Park. But these relationships are not presented as thought-over, snuck-into, poeticized, sexed-out, or struggled as their interracial counterparts. They do not compose our poetry, our romance, our big bad dreams.
But we cannot ignore the forces that may drive an interracial relationship: the tendency to fetishize and the desire to be accepted, the integration of stereotypes into illusion and the adoption of whiteness as ideal. And though it is generally coarse, rash, and misdirected, the critique of Constance Wu as “hypocritical” is not illogical. Because the representatives of our community truly do contradict themselves, in ways that demonstrate superficial advocacy for our community but never real love for it. Like when, on Season 6 of America’s Next Top Model, Gina Choe talked about representing Asian Americans in the modeling world, then claimed that she didn’t date Asian men because they were “too short” for her. Even I wonder how strong, deep, a person’s sense of identity can be if too much of it revolves around explaining it to someone incapable of feeling it. I wonder how much of our activism’s language is created with white partners as the implied audience. Because I know when I talk about representation, fetishization, emasculation, I am pleading to be seen. For my people to know that they are as good, as beautiful, as interesting lovers as white people.
I talk about love because I know the power of two bodies with the same glisten as the hotel room’s fade. I know what’s behind the picture. When I see you see me. To yellow kids who know. With you, everything I touch turns to gold. I didn’t choose you for comfort. Not because I was supposed to. I chose you because you see me. And when you closed your eyes I was loving the tear marks on your cheeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(With apologies to The Globe and Mail’s Ivor Tossell.)
Stanford gets sunny days, to the point that you get bored of them. It’s a cliché. It’s also true. Back when I lived in New England, if there was a sunny day, you bet I was going to go out and enjoy it. At Stanford students spend sunny days inside studying.
Stanford gets In-n-Out Burger. Shut up. It’s better.
Stanford gets Skylar and Will. Their dramatic exploits will soon be detailed in Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season, where Will accuses the students of “regurgitating Elon Musk”, sees the light, and eventually joins the NSA.
Stanford gets Silicon Valley, the TV show.
Stanford also gets Silicon Valley, the actual place, which is generally considered a plus.
Stanford gets space, and it flaunts every inch of it. A mile will bring you all the way from the Charles to Radcliffe Quad, which for College students might as well be Mars. Stanford’s driveway is a mile long.
And Stanford gets the tools to conquer space. In these turbulent times, Fortress Stanford stands alone. The worst drought in a thousand years stops as soon as you get on campus. The entire world seems to fall away as soon as you cross Campus Drive.
Stanford also gets a number of incredibly important things that Harvard students have too, like world-class professors, a dominant alumni network, an eleven-figure hedge fund bankrolling every club you could ever imagine, and waffle irons that make waffles with the university logo on them.
Rightly or not, though, Stanford gets the nation’s lowest undergrad admission rate, which tends to swell people’s heads.
And isn’t our little war of admission rates at the heart of why this column matters? At the end of the day, you’re reading this because Stanford gets the (highly annoying) subtitle in American pop culture as “that plucky little school in Palo Alto that’s challenging Harvard to become number one.” All of this excruciating drama even though by Week 5 it is clear that your admission to any of these schools owes far more to luck than it ever could have to fate. Getting into Harvard/Stanford/[insert school here] is not a sign that you are God’s gift to mankind: it is your first lesson that the forces of destiny are blind.
And so the student at any of America’s great universities – not just Stanford or Harvard, but Berkeley or Rice or Michigan or Navy – shrugs off the idiocy of rankings and moves on with their lives. But the mind is not always rational, and in light of all the admittedly meaningful similarities that draw these schools together in the national mind, it still seems that for a lot of Harvard students, and vice versa, Stanford is a reflection in a smoky mirror – themselves, but through a glass, darkly.
The irony is that culturally, these schools have very little in common. They are both, of course, academically elitist. No one will ever accuse Stanford University or Harvard University of being down to earth. But if you must compare Stanford to an East Coast school, Stanford is not Harvard. Stanford is Duke. It may be 125 years old, but for a long while yet the defining difference between Stanford and its Ivy League cousins will still be that Stanford is self-evidently new money.
That, and the fact that Stanford gets Stanford.
Stanford gets the West, and all its transcendent glory. For all that students like to talk about how stressed they “secretly” feel, there is a certain joy to the University – a joy that can only come from living within an aura of infinite possibility. To be clear, the frontier is dead.  We long ago realized that the New World was no longer new. But you learn very quickly here that today’s frontier is whatever you make of it.
The Ivy League schools all compel you to live in the shadow of the past. There is always someone to desperately chase. I actually think that’s a good thing in a way. It gives you a ready-made sense of pride, direction, and identity. It shows you that great people have passed through the same halls as you, and that someday you might be like them. But even though Campus Drive carries its own remarkable past, Stanford is still young enough that you can imagine doing something truly new. Everything about it is new. It’s an old university, but it’s never felt old to me. It doesn’t pretend to be fulfilled or complete. And when you bring in a bunch of young people who have never before failed and give them all the resources they need to succeed with no reason to hold back, you can see the birth of a brash confidence – constant, pulsating frissons of excitement that whatever we've accomplished is just the beginning. You can see a thousand dreams still in the making and a million worlds still unconquered.
As a high schooler in Massachusetts, I always felt out of place for wanting to go to Stanford. Harvard carries an almost religious quality for people in the Bay State, and to repudiate that dream still feels, five years later, like some act of unspeakable heresy against my adopted kind. People could barely conceptualize why I’d ever want to go so far away, but that was precisely because Stanford was a theater of dreams too wonderful to even imagine. And Stanford was, for want of a better word, unreal. This wasn’t always a good thing. I returned to Stanford a few months after graduation, and the truth is that yes, Stanford still feels like a welcoming fortress. I was reminded once again that I had spent four years in paradise. Stanford was heaven before its time. But life is imperfect, and Stanford’s insistent perfection creates a reality distortion field, in a way that not even the rest of the Bay Area can match. The campus was too gorgeous, the lawns were too neat, the sky was too blue. Even its timing was perfect. When I arrived in Palo Alto Stanford felt like the biggest, newest challenge in the world. Four years later, it feels disquietingly familiar – comforting, but a comfort zone nonetheless.
Stanford’s not a place where I could envision spending more than four years. But in a very real sense it is the greatest place on earth, and more importantly, a world I honestly miss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the student body returns to classes after a three-day weekend, we must not allow Columbus Day to pass by without raising questions about its status as a University holiday. This debate is not a new one, and student groups on campus have been protesting naming a holiday after Christopher Columbus for decades. Every year that the University continues to observe the day as Columbus Day, the issue is revived.
Enough time has now passed. It is imperative that the University officially rename the holiday Indigenous Peoples Day.
Columbus’ arrival in the Americas led to the enslavement, exploitation, and mass genocide of indigenous people who’d been living on the continent for centuries. His arrival sparked an imperialist project by which hundreds of Europeans came to the Americas, pillaged the land's natural resources, and in the process wiped out entire populations. The complex, sophisticated civilizations of indigenous people were replaced by the imposed religious and political systems of the Europeans, leading to the subjugation of entire cultures. To this end, Christopher Columbus was not a hero and therefore does not deserve a holiday that glorifies him.
In light of this erasure of indigenous people and culture, the University ought to recognize this holiday as Indigenous Peoples Day. Not only does a name change force us to reconsider the impact of European colonizers have had on this country, it also allows indigenous people the opportunity to reclaim the day as their own. Native Americans have been central to the foundation of the United States, but their contribution has been forgotten. Twenty-six states derive their name from Native words, and this is just the surface of the deep wealth of contributions.  Instead of acknowledging these additions, the American imagination holds onto a revised and idealized history that wrongfully holds European enslavers on a pedestal. There is no need to celebrate European colonialism again.
Campus conversations, including previous Crimson Editorial Board stances, have failed to center the conversation surrounding Columbus Day on indigenous people. By renaming the holiday Indigenous Peoples Day, it will focus on a people who have been seeking visibility throughout this nation’s history. With the day off of school, different individuals and groups on campus can focus on celebrating the indigenous cultures that are underrepresented in our curricula, traditions, and national narrative. It should be a day to validate Native American individuals, and to support them in their contemporary fight to preserve their culture.

UPDATED: October 12, 2016, at 11:42 p.m.
Harvard dining workers’ historic strike will likely continue throughout the rest of the week and some dining halls will remain closed, despite efforts by Harvard to assuage its dining workers’ demands on health care and wages.
“We are deeply disappointed that the union has declined to engage in a constructive dialogue,” Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote in an email to adminsitrative deans Monday detailing the latest back-and forth between the University and Local 26 in their months-long contract stalemate.
Harvard University Dining Services administration sent students an email Monday night, detailing that "HUDS managers will continue to serve students to the best of their ability for the duration of the work stoppage," set to continue into the week, and thanking students for support during "this challenging time."
Negotiators from Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers, met Monday for their 22nd bargaining session. The two parties have met since May, debating over health care packages and wage increases for dining services workers.
Harvard has proposed that the average rate for dining workers increase from $21.89 to $24.08. Additionally, in earlier sessions, Harvard proposed a series of summer stipends that would effectively pay dining workers who are available to work during the summer between $150 and $250 per week, regardless of whether they worked a shift during the week. The union rejected that request and, according to the email, offered a counter proposal that would increase the amount of that stipend to $450 per week.
“While any labor negotiation inevitably includes challenging issues, the university and its labor unions have always found common ground on the importance of good faith efforts to achieve a resolution that meets the needs of employees and the long-term strength of the university’s teaching and research mission,” Hausammann wrote.
Harvard’s dining workers have not seen a change in their health benefits packages since 2008, according to Hausammann, even as national health care prices have risen steadily. In 2016, two of Harvard’s unions negotiated a new health care plan that eliminates deductibles, increases copayments and introduces a new premium contribution tier for employees who make $55,000 or less annually.
At the start of the negotiations, Harvard suggested that Local 26 enroll in that same coverage, but the union rejected the offer. Towards the end of September, Harvard offered an “enhanced” version of that plan, according to Hausammann, in which Harvard would contribute 87 percent of the premium of the lowest-cost plan, as well as fund a “flexible savings account” of $80 per year in 2018 and 2019, and $40 in 2020. These proposed changes would not be implemented until 2018.
In the event that the union rejected that proposal, Harvard offered a second option, in which union members would enroll in a health care plan offered by UNITE HERE. Harvard would contribute the “equivalent cost of the Harvard University Group Health Plan enrollment premium” to that health care plan. Local 26 rejected both proposals.
Harvard then offered the union an alternative in which it would contribute $25 million over four years for HUDS workers to enroll in UNITE HERE’s health care coverage; Local 26 did not accept.
As picketing continues without any foreseeable conclusion, several upperclassmen dining halls will remain closed throughout the duration of the strike.
At press time, Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck had not responded to requests for comment.
Closed dining halls include: Lowell House, Leverett House, Mather House, Adams House, Cabot House and Pforzheimer House. These dining halls have been closed since Saturday, when it became apparent Harvard and the union would not reach an agreement before the holiday weekend. Freshmen will not be allowed to eat in the Houses, though Annenberg will remain open exclusively for them.
Harvard is also operating with a fraction of its normal dining workforce, which now consists of HUDS managers, temporary employees, and volunteers from other parts of the University.
In an email sent to Lowell House residents on Monday, Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck, wrote that Harvard administrators would communicate to students about the progress of the strike and how dining halls will operate for "the rest of the week."
“Dearest Lowell. . . . The ‘rest of the week’ doesn’t sound good to me,” Eck wrote.

Harvard University is not legally required to divest from the fossil fuel industry, a Massachusetts Appeals court ruled last week, reaffirming a lower court ruling that struck down a suit from student activists.
In 2014, a group of seven students filed a lawsuit arguing that Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry were a violation of the University’s charter and contributed to global climate change. A Superior Court judge dismissed the suit in March 2015, ruling that the students did not have legal standing to challenge the University’s management of its investments. The students, called the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, appealed the decision to the Massachusetts Appeals Court, which upheld the Superior Court judge’s dismissal. 
“The plaintiffs, moreover, fail to show that they have been accorded a personal right in the management or administration of Harvard's endowment that is individual to them or distinct from the student body or public at large,” Appeals Court judge Elspeth B. Cypher wrote in the ruling. The Appeals Court also took issue with the students’ argument that they represented the interests of future generations of people.
Beyond the lawsuit, activists have staged public protests calling on Harvard to divest its $35.7 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry. In April 2015, Divest Harvard, a larger student group dedicated to protesting Harvard’s financial ties to fossil fuels, blockaded a number of administrative buildings in a week-long protest dubbed “Heat Week.”
University President Drew G. Faust has said repeatedly that Harvard will not divest its endowment from fossil fuels, calling such a move unduly political for an academic institution.
Joseph E. “Ted” Hamilton, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit and a member of the Harvard Climate Justice Coalition, wrote in a statement that the ruling was disappointing. The coalition is weighing its options for future litigation, Hamilton wrote.
“Today, despite the strength of our legal arguments in favor of divestment, the status quo prevailed over judicial imagination,” Hamilton wrote. “Nonetheless, we have faith that the global divestment movement and other climate legal actions will prove stronger than the intransigence of established interests.”
Anna Cowenhoven, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson, wrote in a statement that the University was “pleased” with the court’s ruling.
“We agree that climate change poses a serious threat to our planet, but respectfully disagree with the students who brought the lawsuit on the means by which a university should confront it,” Cowenhoven wrote.
Since its large “Heat Week” protest in spring 2015, Divest Harvard has hosted several demonstrations against Harvard’s investments in the fossil fuel industry, but generally has been less active. In April 2016, police arrested four students who had hosted a sit-in in the lobby of the Boston Federal Reserve building, which holds the offices of Harvard’s investment arm, Harvard Management Company.

Attracting visitors with famous showman P.T. Barnum’s Feejee Mermaid sculpture, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology drew dozens to its 150th anniversary celebration Saturday.
Students and families gathered at the museum—one of the oldest anthropology museums in the world—to enjoy cake, music, and free admission. Staff members took unusual exhibits out of storage and displayed them in honor of the anniversary.
“It is a way to bring some wonderful experiences in front of students and the general public that they don’t usually have,” Polly R. Hubbard, education department manager at the Peabody Museum, said.
One of the main artifacts brought out of storage was the Feejee Mermaid, a sculpture made from a monkey skeleton and a fish tail. P.T. Barnum, who co-founded the Barnum and Bailey Circus, owned the item and used it in his shows in Manhattan.
“We are known worldwide for the Feejee Mermaid. We are known worldwide for some of the other objects that are coming on display, so we wanted to do some of our, sort of, classic ‘treasures’ that are so well known,” Peabody Museum Director Jeffrey Quilter said.
In 1866, international financier and early philanthropist George Peabody endowed a “Peabody Professor-Curator” for $150,000 to purchase artifacts and collect them in a building. An avid donor, Peabody has his name on museums and institutes across the United States; the town of Peabody, Mass., is named in his honor. The construction of the Peabody’s building at Harvard was completed in 1877, and  the museum today houses 1.2 million objects from around the world.
Folklore and Mythology lecturer Felicity Lufkin commended the museum for the access it gives to teachers.
“I like the displays that are public, and I feel like it’s extra fun because I get to go behind the scenes sometimes,” she said, adding that she recently visited the Feejee Mermaid because she had never seen it before.
The event also generated interest outside Harvard. Boston resident Stefanie D. Rich said she was eager to see the Feejee Mermaid.
“I woke up and said, ‘Oh my God, it’s free admission day. We have to go,’” she said.
The Peabody had advertised the celebration since August and anticipated that about 1,000 people would come to the event, Hubbard said.
Overall, Peabody staff and event attendees said they were excited to celebrate the occasion.
“If you’re going to have a birthday, you should celebrate,” Quilter said. “Birthdays never come again. You’re never going to be 20 again and you’re never going to be 150 again.”

Economics professor Oliver Hart became the most recent in a long line of Harvard faculty members to earn the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, receiving the award in conjunction with MIT professor Bengt Holmström “for their contributions to contract theory."
In total, 49 Harvard faculty and alumni have won Nobel Prizes, beginning as early as 1914.Of those 49 Nobel Prizes, 10 have been in Economics. Most recently for the department, Alvin E. Roth received the prize in 2012, shortly before departing for Stanford University—as several other of his colleagues have done in recent years.
"Hart’s findings on incomplete contracts have shed new light on the ownership and control of businesses and have had a vast impact on several fields of economics, as well as political science and law," read a press release from the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts and Sciences, the body that awards the Nobel Prize. 
Economics professor Eric S. Maskin ’72, who himself received the Economics Nobel Prize in 2007 and has collaborated with Hart on several papers, lauded his “old friend.”
“I’ve been waiting for this for years, because he has been well-known for many years now and he could well have won well before now,” Maskin said.
Economics Department Chair David I. Laibson ’88 said the announcement was welcome news for the entire department.
“It’s incredibly exciting for all of us on so many different levels” he said. “Clearly we know the work. It is breathtaking research and scholarship and we are so excited to see it recognized in this way, both at the personal level because we love our colleague dearly and at the professional level because we think this work is really important and transformative.”
Hart first joined Harvard’s faculty in 1993 after teaching at M.I.T. According to the University’s course catalog, he currently teaches several classes primarily for graduate students as well as a freshman seminar in the spring, FRSEMR 42C: “The Role of Government.”
“It was obvious at the time that Professor Hart was brilliant but I wasn’t aware of how brilliant until it was legitimized in this external way,” Benjamin Delsman ’19, who took Hart’s seminar last spring, said.
Delsman added that Hart made himself very accessible to his students, and even arranged a dinner outing with the seminar students at the restaurant Dumpling House.
Maskin, who is familiar with the post-Nobel Prize experience, said Hart can expect to play a more public role and be called on to address non-economists. However, Maskin added that many aspects of his job did not change following his receipt of the award.
“I still put teaching and research at the top of the list, and I expect Oliver will do the same,” he said.
In the wake of the announcement, Laibson said he took Hart out to lunch and will hold a celebration for Hart Tuesday in University Hall.
“It’s such a pleasure for me, as a colleague, to celebrate his life’s work in this way,” Laibson said. “It’s a joy to be with him and to feel his happiness.”
Most recently before Hart, Harvard chemistry professor emeritus Martin Karplus ’51 won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2013.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Kennedy School of Government students advocated for more innovations aimed at engaging the public in local politics and shared their experiences working at the municipal level Friday afternoon.
The panel, “Democracy Entrepreneurship: Hands-on with Participatory Innovation,” was part of the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation’s Student Speaker Series, which invites students to discuss their research projects.
Ana Babovic discussed her experience working with the Citizen’s Initiative Review in Massachusetts, a project aimed at informing voters about ballot measures.
The project involved assembling 20 randomly selected voters from across the state to discuss the proposed legalization of marijuana for recreational use, also known as Question 4 on the ballot. After hearing from experts in the field for four days, the voters created a Citizens’ Statement discussing the pros and cons of each side.
“Citizens have a responsibility, but it’s not only a responsibility for voting. It’s a responsibility for what comes afterward,” Babovic said.
Elizabeth M. Ribble said she spent the summer working on the New York City’s Participatory Budgeting initiative, which allows local residents to help direct how the city council allocates its budget and seeks to increase the involvement of underrepresented groups.
“As [the city council members] involve people who are underrepresented, they build more trust, and the city gets a better idea of what needs to happen in the community,” Ribble said.
Audience members said they found the panel helpful in gaining exposure to experiences outside the classroom.
“It sobered me up to the challenges that exist between coordinating a public and private sector project,” attendee Frank D. Hines ’85, who is working towards the economic revitalization of Franklin Field in Dorchester, said.
In an interview after the event, Ribble said that small-scale initiatives to engage voters on a local level are especially important at a time when many Americans are disillusioned with larger political institutions that they find “toxic.”
“I think this is key for getting people’s trust and re-establishing the involvement in the political system,” she said.

Harvard affiliates joined with dining services strikers in the Yard Monday afternoon to celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day with a ceremony that included cultural dances, chants, music, and spoken word to honor the culture of Native American groups.
According to organizers, the primary objective of the gathering was to petition the College to recognize the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead of Columbus Day.
Native Americans at Harvard College president Damon J. Clark ’17 said the group seeks this change in light of the University’s historical commitment to Native Americans.
“Harvard needs to lead. If Harvard leads, others will follow,” he said. “Harvard has a commitment to Native Americans as old as Harvard.”
The event began outside Matthews Hall, where students taped handmade signs with phrases such as “Columbus Was No Hero” and “Celebrate Indigenous Resistance.” After two hours of celebration in the Yard, the crowd of roughly 150 people moved to Ticknor Lounge for a dinner with traditional Native American foods.
Though Native Americans at Harvard College have organized similar commemorations in past years, this year’s event coincided with a Harvard University Dining Services rally outside Massachusetts Hall, and participants in the HUDS rally joined in the festivities.
HUDS worker William Ridgley, who is Native American, said at the ceremony that both the Native Americans at Harvard College and HUDS workers are working to have their voice heard by the Harvard administration.
Event organizers said they wanted to showcase how their efforts go beyond Harvard College at the event. As a part of the ceremony, a group of students from the Harvard Graduate School of Education spoke of their support for the movement and the importance of including Native American narratives in education.
The Native Americans of Harvard College enjoy support from the Undergraduate Council and Student Advisory Committee in their efforts, and hope to have hundreds sign a petition supporting their efforts as well, according to Clark.
“We believe our simple request for Indigenous People’s Day is representation of hope and how actions can create a movement and become a policy,” Clark said.

The Undergraduate Council on Monday overwhelmingly endorsed a motion calling for the University to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day instead of Columbus Day a week after hearing a presentation from Native Americans at Harvard College President Damon J. Clark ’17.
“We're not a big population, we're very small,” Clark said in his presentation last week. “I think just recognizing our history is something we really want to address.”
Before his presentation, Clark distributed a memo to Council members, writing that “Native Americans at Harvard College (NAHC) insists the Harvard Undergraduate Council supports the initiative for Harvard University to officially-recognize the second Monday of October as ‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day.’”
The national debate over renaming Columbus Day has grown in prominence over the past several years, with proponents arguing that Native Americans should receive recognition on the day as opposed to 15th century Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. In June, the Cambridge City Council voted to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day.
The UC’s Rules Committee will write an open letter to University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 expressing the UC’s endorsement.
“It is important to students on this campus, and the UC can provide additional assistance,” UC Rules Committee Chair Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said.
Although the Council overwhelmingly agreed on the policy, several representatives argued that a shift from Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples’ Day was not enough to fully promote the representation of Native Americans on campus. Clark agreed, but said recognizing Indigenous Peoples’ Day would at least be a step forward.
“People may view it as a band-aid solution, but I view it as a beginning,” Clark said.
UC Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 said he also wanted to push for more Native American faculty members on campus.
“We are going to work on our end to make this happen,” Ely said.
“Thank you from the heart,” Clark said to the Council after the vote, which he attended. “Happy Indigenous People’s Day.”
Native Americans at Harvard College held events Monday to promote recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ Day and circulated a petition that has received more than 100 signatures, according to Clark.
During the UC’s Monday meeting, the Council passed legislation sponsored by UC Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 to allocate $1,466 to fund shuttles to the airport for Thanksgiving Break, as the Council has done for the past several years.
UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 also announced several new initiatives in his committee. Beginning with last week’s requests for UC funding, student organizations who request $200 or less for food or publicity may be eligible for the committee’s “Small Grants Initiative” which expedites the grant approval process by not requiring an interview to receive a grant.
Greenlaw also announced upcoming plans to expand sexual assault prevention training to groups that receive funds from the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. The committee will also begin reviewing how accurately student organizations predict, in their grant applications, the number of people who will attend their events.

Future Undergraduate Council presidents and vice presidents may be eligible to receive a stipend of up to $1,500, thanks to a new program designed to lower financial barriers for students seeking leadership positions on the Council.
The UC-sponsored pilot program, which received overwhelming support at the UC’s Monday meeting, will allocate $6,000 from last academic year’s unused student term bill funds. The program will offer the UC president and vice president $1,000 per year if they are on financial aid and $1,500 each if they are in the College’s “high financial aid bracket”— defined as those who pay between 0 and 10 percent of annual tuition.
The stipend will apply beginning with next year’s UC leaders, if they meet the financial aid requirements of the program. Students interested in running for UC president and vice president have until the end of October to declare their candidacy.
UC President Shaiba Rather ’17, Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, and Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18 introduced the initiative, called “The Undergraduate Council Presidential and Vice Presidential Stipend Program,” before the Council Monday.
Rather and Banks have been working on the initiative since at least the beginning of the semester, and presented the idea in their semesterly meeting with University President Drew G. Faust last week.
“The intent of this program is… to make sure that students from all socioeconomic backgrounds have a chance to be in these leadership roles and not have to worry about having a term-time job,” Rather said.
“We feel that compensation should be offered so that these two positions can be offered to people of greater socioeconomic diversity,” she added.
Quincy House representative Olu Oisaghie ’19 proposed an amendment that would eliminate the financial aid condition from the program and provide a $1,500 stipend to all UC leaders regardless of their financial aid status. The Council debated the amendment extensively, but ultimately voted against it.
Eliot House representative Taylor D. Marquis ’18 proposed another amendment to the program that would recommend future Councils replenish the fund to the original $6,000 every two years. The Council voted in favor of the amendment.
Many representatives praised the legislation.
“This is meant to be an equalizing mechanism,” UC Education Committee Vice Chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said. “Right now running for UC president requires a lot of thought. One thing it shouldn't require thinking about is whether or not you can do it financially.”
The legislation passed with all but two representatives voting in favor. UC Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 abstained from voting, and Lowell House representative Benjamin F. Molin ’18 voted against the policy.
Molin objected to the use of student funds to finance the program. The UC’s money comes from a $75 Student Activities Fee that most students pay at the beginning of the academic year.
“This is being funded through money that should be allocated to all students, and should be for events that every student can go to,” Molin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s lawyers made the case to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Alyssa R. Leader ’15, who alleged widespread misconduct by Harvard administrators in handling her sexual harassment claims, in the first court hearing for the suit Friday.
Harvard moved to throw out Leader’s case in a series of filings over the summer, arguing that Harvard’s response to her sexual harassment claims do not constitute a violation of the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Months later, Leader’s attorney filed opposing motions challenging Harvard’s arguments.
Leader’s counsel, led by Irwin M. Zalkin, maintained that Harvard acted with “deliberate indifference” throughout its 2015 investigation of her claims that she was sexually abused by a fellow Harvard student—referred to in the suit as “John Doe”—during their “dating relationship.” According to a 1999 decision by the Supreme Court, a deliberately indifferent school may be held responsible for private student-to-student sexual assault when that assault is determined to deprive the victim of educational opportunity.
Harvard’s lead counsel, including O’Melveny & Myers’s Apalla U. Chopra and Harvard Law graduate Danielle C. Gray, countered the allegation of “deliberate indifference,” arguing that Harvard took appropriate steps to investigate Leader’s claims and offer her support services. Pointing to Harvard’s attempts to separate Leader from her alleged assailant, Chopra held that Harvard’s offers to relocate Leader and issue a no-contact letter were sufficient remedy to satisfy Title IX.
“[Leader] alleges only that Harvard should have conducted its investigation differently, or provided her with remedial options more to her liking,” Harvard’s filings read. “She fails to plausibly allege that Harvard breached any duty owed to her or that Harvard’s conduct was the proximate cause of her alleged injuries.”
Harvard's counsel also refuted Leader’s charges that the University was negligent in its response, claiming that any retaliatory actions perpetrated by Doe or his friends were not “reasonably foreseeable.” Based on the investigation, Chopra argued that Harvard did not put additional students at risk or jeopardize a safe environment on campus.
Zalkin pushed back, arguing it was a "serious problem" that Harvard was unwilling to remove John Doe from the same dorm, even though Leader successfully filed for a restraining order in civil court. Only then did Harvard remove Doe from Cabot House and leave Leader in her residence.
Massachusetts federal judge Denise J. Casper presided over the court hearing, challenging Harvard’s counsel to defend their motion to dismiss the case wholesale. But Casper also grilled Zalkin, pushing him to clarify the ways in which Harvard’s remedial offers to Leader were insufficient.
Following the proceedings in Boston, Zalkin explained why he thought Harvard’s offers failed to meet acceptable remedial options.
“A mutual restraining order, in this case, where they’re both living in the same facility, they’re working in the same employment, is not manageable,” he said. “Not without putting an undue and unreasonable burden on her.”
Scrutiny into Harvard's Title IX compliance is not new. In 2014, the United States Department of Education found Harvard Law School in violation of Title IX, and the government is also currently investigating the the College’s compliance with Title IX.

UPDATED: October 13, 2016, at 6:39 p.m.
As the historic dining workers’ strike stretches into its second week, some students are starting to question the quality and health standards of the food being served.
Students have reported finding undercooked meals, meat mixed in with vegetarian food, and insects in their food, prompting some to wonder whether understaffed kitchens are able to maintain the regular health and safety standards of Harvard University Dining Services.
Marcus K. Granderson ’18 and Nader Shayegh ’18 both said they were served raw chicken. Rena Lyon ’18, a vegetarian, said she found pieces of meat in banana bread pudding. Cara R. Jacobson ’18, who has Celiac disease and cannot eat gluten, said getting food during the strike has been “pretty difficult.”
Many students have criticized the food served in the dining halls since the strike—led by dining hall workers affiliated with the Boston-based union UNITE HERE Local 26—began last Wednesday. Anticipating the strike, Harvard stockpiled frozen food, and a few students said during the strike they saw entrees that were served nearly frozen. More generally, some students, like  SLAM member Grace F. Evans ’19, said they thought offerings over the weekend were “significantly less appetizing” than usual.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that Harvard’s “commitment to food safety remains paramount.” She said professionals oversee the  food preparation and cooking process, and the “HUDS leadership team… makes numerous daily visits to dining halls to review the sanitation and quality of the dining operation.”
Facing staff shortages while hundreds of its employees picket, Harvard has stocked dining halls with easy-to-cook meals like filled pasta shells and chicken and dumplings. But some students are concerned with more than just the lack of quality food.
SLAM, a campus group advocating for HUDS workers, issued a statement via Facebook and email on Sunday sharply criticizing what it deemed risky food preparation. Their statement included photos of what appeared to be raw chicken.
“It’s clear that Harvard can’t deliver hygienic, fresh, or healthy food without HUDS workers,” the statement read. “This food would not pass a health inspection, and we are angry that the University has put students in this situation.”
Jacobson said because the current food in dining halls does not meet her dietary needs, she has eaten out in Harvard Square this week, which has proven a financial burden.
“I have tried eating in the dining hall during the strike, and what I’ve found is that my food is generally limited to the salad bar. The grill is closed. In terms of entrees, there are very few gluten free options, so that has been very limiting as well.” Jacobson said.
An email from HUDS sent out to undergraduates Monday afternoon said HUDS managers would continue to staff the dining halls, serving students “to the best of their ability” for the duration of the strike.  It also said “students who have food allergies or other food related accommodations will continue to have their dietary needs met.”
“The health and well-being of our students continues to be our main priority during this difficult time. I know this ongoing situation is not ideal... We continue to hope for a resolution,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an emailed statement. He added that students with concerns regarding food should speak to their Faculty Deans, assistant deans, or their individual dining hall managers.
Some students have sought food at on-campus cafes. On Friday, the University announced students would receive an additional $25 of BoardPlus, which can be used at many on-campus eateries.
Megan Yerton ’19, a senior manager at Lamont Library Cafe, said that student employees have noticed an increase in customer volume, especially during meal hours, since the strike began last Wednesday. She said their food items, especially sandwiches and pastries, have sold out faster than usual.
Harvard and Local 26 have met for bargaining sessions during the strike. The University has made several new offers that Local 26 has not accepted. An end to the strike is not expected this week.

Back on the East Coast and racing in Boston, the Harvard women’s cross country team battled to an impressive second place finish in a competition that brought together 35 of the top teams from the New England area.
Hosted by Boston University, the New England Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association’s Cross Country Championships takes place annually on 5,000-meter course in Franklin Park, which also serves as the Crimson’s home turf.
With the second-place finish, the Harvard women’s cross country team put together its second straight top-three performance.
This weeks effort was led by a breakout performance by Junior Elianna Shwayder, who placed third out of over 230 runners. Shwayder’s crossed the finish line in 17:46.1, the best recorded finish in her Harvard cross-country career and her best collegiate 5K time.
Especially in a crowded field along a course with diverse conditions-fields, wide trails and grass pathways, Shwayder’s secret to her success was her mental strength throughout the race.
“One of my biggest goals for the cross country season is to improve my mental approach to racing,” Shwayder said. “I was running to win the race. I knew I would be right in the mix to lead. I felt relaxed and confident throughout most of the race. I believed I could win.”
With two years of collegiate running under her belt, Shwayder no longer fears racing as an opportunity to fail, but rather now views each race and an opportunity to grow.
“This year, I am looking for what I can learn from each and every experience,” Shwayder explained. “Yesterday was just another opportunity to learn about myself as a runner, a competitor, and a teammate.”
Looking forward, Shwayder now knows how she wants to mentally push herself when she is in a position to win.
“After the race, rather than fixating on the negative aspect of losing contact with the leader during the last 1k of the race, I learned that when I am in a position to win, I need to use all my ‘moves’ to prevent,” Shwayder said.
The only team other than New Hampshire to finish three runners in the top-20, the Crimson also snatched 16th and 17th places. Pushing each other throughout the race, freshman Eliza Rego and Brooke Starn finished with times of 18:18.4 and 18:20.3 respectively.
“I have enjoyed watching them push each other, and us upperclassmen, to new levels in both workouts and races,” said sophomore Malia Ellington.
Looking ahead, Harvard will split next weekend for three races around the country - the
Wisconsin Adidas Invitational on Oct. 14, and the Princeton Invitational and Pre-National Championships in Terre Haute, Indiana both on Oct. 15.
“The team dynamic this year is more dynamic, cohesive, and driven that it has ever been during my tenure on the team,” said Shwayder. “ It may take a couple of races for them to get to know their collegiate competition. Collegiate racing is about learning how to compete with the pack you're in without knowing exactly where you are during the race.”

The Harvard sailing team demonstrated its resilience this weekend, fighting through difficult conditions to secure another set of strong results at two regattas. Despite facing heavy rain and challenging, variable wind, the Crimson was able to collect a pair of top-ten finishes, including its second victory of the year.
“The conditions were especially tough with the hurricane winds and rain rolling through, but other than a few minor errors, our team had a solid weekend,” sophomore skipper Nicholas DiGiovanni said.
With the weather making racing difficult, consistency proved to be essential, and Harvard’s ability to find constancy on the water helped steer the team to success.
NICHOLAS BARNETT TROPHY
The Crimson not only won, but did so in decisive fashion at the combined scoring, in-conference regatta, hosted by Bowdoin and contested in FJs. The result saw Harvard beat out eight other schools and finish 23 points ahead of second-place Boston University.
Despite collecting a handful of top-three finishes, the Crimson A boat of sophomore skipper Jackson Wagner and sophomore crew Divya Arya finished the regatta as the second-fastest lineup in the A division, falling to BU by five points. However, Harvard’s B duo of sophomore skipper Nicholas Karnovsky and sophomore crew Alejandra Resendiz was dominant throughout the weekend. The pair ended up outside of the top 10 only once and brought home 10 finishes inside the top five spots across 18 races.
“The key was to be consistent as a team,” Resendiz said. “On Sunday, we had a northerly breeze that was far more confusing, but luckily our lead from Saturday helped to make up.”
The Crimson B boat’s 104 points meant that it outscored not only all other B crews, but every A crew as well, making it the top-scoring boat for the regatta. With the B boat having secured the leading spot, Harvard’s A lineup rounded out the podium in third, cementing the Crimson victory.
Harvard topped a number of strong perennial rivals en route to the win, including BU, Bowdoin, Tufts, and Northeastern, who finished second to fifth in that order.
MOODY TROPHY
Despite a dramatic shift in conditions at the University of Rhode Island-hosted bi-divisional regatta, the Crimson managed to maintain some consistency and secure a top-10 finish.
The first day was marked by a lack of wind, with only occasional gusts rippling the generally glass-like water. However, the weather would change abruptly by day two as remnants of Hurricane Matthew brought driving rain and strong winds to Rhode Island. Although the alteration caused several of the leading crews to slip up, Harvard was unable to capitalize on its’ rivals mistakes, finishing the weekend 10th in a field of 17 teams.
Racing in FJs, the Crimson’s A crew of junior captain and skipper Nick Sertl and sophomore crew Christine Gosioco remained largely unaffected by the shifting conditions.The duo ended up among the top 10 finishers in five of six races and cracked the top five twice along the way. At the end of the weekend, Sertl and Gosioco were the fourth-highest scoring A lineup, with their total of 40 points setting them a mere one point behind the A crews from Yale and Tufts.
The results of the Harvard B lineup of DiGiovanni and sophomore crew Lena Episalla suffered more in the changing wind, however. The pair finished in the top 10 in three races, but they were plagued by inconsistency. Battling with the tricky wind patterns and driving rain, the B boat’s finishes varied by at least three points between every race, and the duo never cracked the top half of competitors.
The conditions did not impact the Crimson as extensively as they did Brown, who sat in second place after the first day but fell to seventh after a string of bottom-half results. Nonetheless, the string of uneven results meant that Harvard was unable to replicate its victory at the regatta in 2015.

­Harvard could have packed its bags after the first two minutes and 44 seconds of its game Saturday afternoon, as the first goal of the game proved to be the only goal the Crimson needed as it cruised to a dominating 4-0 victory over Ivy foe Cornell. Harvard (5-3-2, 1-0-1 Ivy) extended its undefeated streak to four games while the Big Red (0-9-2, 0-2-0) dropped its second consecutive Ancient Eight game and has yet to pick up a victory so far this season.
“We came prepared and the players played one of those complete games where from the beginning to the end, it was good, simple play, good intensity, good fight, good defending.” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “It was overall our best performance.”
After falling behind early in recent games, the Crimson finally got off to its desired start against Cornell. Harvard pressed high from the get go, dominating possession and pinning the Big Red into its own third before opening the scoring just three minutes into the game.
Senior forward Jake Freeman gained possession in the midfield and set it to junior midfielder Sam Brown, who played a through ball to sophomore forward Cesar Farias. With three Cornell defenders around him, Farias–who missed the game against Yale due to an accumulation of yellow cards–calmly slotted the ball down low past Big Red keeper Ryan Shellow after the goalie prematurely came out of his box.
The game quickly devolved into a scrappy midfield battle, as both teams spent the majority of their time looking to create opportunities but were only able to register one shot each before Harvard doubled its lead.
“Coming in we knew they were going to be a team that just fought...battled, played a lot in the air and scrapped.” Freeman said. “We knew whether it was going to be playing on the ground or playing balls over the top and just fighting we were going to grind through 90 minutes.”
Junior midfielder Christian Sady’s over the top through ball found its way to Freeman, who broke the offside trap and controlled the ball with his chest, allowing it to take a bounce before chipping it past Shellow for his fifth goal of the season. The Crimson could have added two more in the span of the next 10 minutes but was unable to spring the offside trap, as the Cornell backline barely managed to step up on time.
Harvard continued its onslaught in the 35th minute as Sady was ruled to have scored an Olympic-style goal from a corner kick following moments of confusion in the Big Red box. Sady swung his corner kick into the box, where it was skimmed Shellow’s glove on its way to the goal. Though a Cornell defender seemingly saved it off the line, starting a sequence of deflections in the box, the ball was judged to have crossed the line. Originally ruled an own goal, the score was eventually given to Sady.
It was relatively straightforward for the Crimson, as the team continued to deny the Big Red any fluidity in the midfield and continually frustrated the Cornell attack. Freeman put the finishing touches in the 68th minute, as junior defender Justin Crichlow’s throw-in was redirected in the box by senior defender Daniel Smith to Freeman, who poked it in for the his second of the game.
With two goals and an assists, the senior moved to 16 points in the season, top of the Ancient Eight among all players.
“It’s great to help my team and if it leads to wins that’s the most important thing but it’s good to see four up there regardless of who scores them so that’s what it’s all about.” Freeman said.
The win kept Harvard in a four-way tie with Brown, Columbia, and Dartmouth atop the Ivy League with four points each going into a critical stretch of five games on the road, including games against conference contenders Brown, Dartmouth and Princeton. Though the team heads into a tough road, Lehrer insists the team will take each game at a time and not deviate by thinking of the big picture.
“You have to create [momentum] every moment.” Lehrer said. “The more you have lulls of focusing on something different or something out of your control, the less you have momentum. For us, momentum is how good you focus on the next most important thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the recent holiday weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team had little reason to celebrate. Many of last year’s returning players were facing injuries, forcing young recruits into action.
Over multiple days at the Yale Bulldog Invite, this squadron of fresh faces competed against Brown, UMass Amherst, and Stony Brook, posting a 1-2 record in the event.
After a 5-2 loss to the Minutewomen on Friday, the Crimson responded with a 4-3 triumph over the Seawolves. Although Harvard tied Stony Brook in singles, the team went 2-1 in doubles to secure the win.
The going was tougher against Brown, the only Ivy League competitor that the Crimson faced all weekend. Harvard dropped that contest, 1-6, with freshman Irene Lu providing the team’s lone victory. She won, 6-2, 7-5, over Bears junior Maddie Stearns.
“I think the matches went pretty well this weekend,” freshman Nika Besker said. “We are all improving with every tournament and every match, so we are all positive about our games. The energy on the courts was also really good, which is especially important for us.”
The team’s youngest players featured throughout the weekend, as four of the six members of the squad travelling to the event were rookies. Besker, Lu, Natasha Gonzalez, and Kaelli Thiel may all be new to the college game, but as captain June Lee described, match experience provides a powerful learning opportunity.
“I think it was especially good for the freshmen to get a taste of what the season is going to be like next semester,” Lee said. “We played some solid teams this weekend, so it was good for everyone to work on their game and just put things we have been working on into practice.”
Starting its weekend off with the doubles portion of a match against UMass Amherst, the Crimson looked to build some momentum with a strong showing right out of the gate. However, each of the three doubles squads fell in single-set elimination games. The pairing of Gonzalez and Jasper was the closest to victory, as the duo posted a 7-5 result.
Winning doubles marks a major point of emphasis for Harvard, as a victory in the event can provide the key tie-breaking point in the overall match score. But doubles wins proved relatively elusive for Harvard, as the team also lost all three of these matches against Brown.
“It's always competitive when we play another Ivy [League school],” Lee said. “[It’s] good to see them early on before the actual Ivy season.”
An exception to this losing trend came against Stony Brook, as the Crimson claimed two of three doubles matches. The pairings of sophomore Isabel Jasper and Gonzalez, and Besker and Lee provided those two key triumphs, both winning 6-4.
Compared to the doubles performance, the Crimson fared better in the longer best-two-out-of-three-sets format in the singles portion of the event. In her first match at the No. 1 position, Lee cruised to victory against UMass Amherst’s Ruth Crawford, 6-2, 6-2. However, Lee later fell 7-5, 6-4 and 2-6, 6-2, 10-7 in hard-fought matches against competitors from Brown and Stony Brook, respectively.
Gonzalez put forth a strong performance of her own. After claiming her first match when her opponent conceded midway through play, the freshman player bested an opponent from Stony Brook, 6-4, 6-3. However, this streak of success came to a halt when Gonzalez lost a decision against No. 116 Alyza Benotto of Brown.
Lu posted the only other winning record for Harvard; her lone loss came to Serbian national Janja Kovacevic of the Minutewomen, 6-2, 6-2.
Brown provided the toughest test for the Crimson on the weekend, indicating that the Ivy League season in the spring should provide a similar challenge for Harvard.
“I think this tournament was a great experience for us,” Besker said. “We all have different things to work on, but the most important thing is that we know our strengths and weaknesses. We are definitely going to improve and get stronger over the [coming] weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are wins and then there are wins. The Harvard women’s rugby team (4-1, 2-1 Ivy League) pulled off a dominant 58-5 win Saturday afternoon against conference foe Princeton (2-1, 0-1).
The Crimson pulled off the pummeling of the Tigers after suffering its only loss thus far of the season last Saturday against Dartmouth.
Seeing the field for the first time since the loss lit a fire under Harvard that did not go out for the duration of the game. The Crimson jumped to a quick lead early in the game and did not look back.
For the majority of the game Harvard had control of the ball, tacking try after try onto the scoreboard until it had gone up 48-0. When the onslaught was all said and done, eight tries had been score by the Crimson and gone unanswered by Princeton.
Multiple Harvard players came through on the offensive side for the Crimson, including senior Clair Collins, junior Maya Learned, sophomores Akweley Okine and Caitlin Weigel, along with freshmen Delia Hellander and Robyn Beese.
The Tigers were able to scratch their way onto the scoreboard late in the contest, coming through with one try to spoil Harvard’s shutout. The Crimson countered Princeton’s score with two more of its own, sealing the points scored on the day.
Saturday’s game was the second-largest points deferential Harvard has racked up against its opponents this season, having outscored the University of New England 54-0 earlier in the year.
With the win, the Crimson  earned home-field advantage for the Ivy League semifinal match on Saturday, Oct. 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen. That’s the number of consecutive road games that the Harvard men’s water polo team played to start the 2016 season.
From Princeton, N.J. to Lewisburg, Pa., the Crimson traveled throughout the East Coast, posting 12 wins along the way. Finally, on Saturday, the team came home for a pair of matches against two Northeast Water Polo Conference rivals at Blodgett Pool.
No. 9 Harvard (13-3, 3-2 NWPC) ended up splitting the doubleheader, bouncing back from defeat against No. 14 Brown (12-6, 4-1 NWPC) with a strong performance against MIT (4-8, 0-5 NWPC).
“Those are two rivalry games, conference games,” coach Ted Minnis said. “I think that everybody knows each other. I thought we played pretty well defensively in both games.”
HARVARD 11, MIT 8
In the first half of this weekend’s Crimson-Engineers matchup, the two teams battled, trading scores and maintaining a high level of intensity.
“I think we were a little too in our own heads with the crowd because this was our home opening weekend,” junior captain Harry Tafur said. “Night games are always fun, and you saw that the stands were pretty filled up. I think that everybody was a little too concerned with the emotions of it all.”
These emotions extended until the end of the third quarter, when Harvard scored two goals in just over a minute to take the lead permanently.
Freshman attacker Charlie Owens ignited the late push with a difficult catch on a long cross-pool pass and a spectacular shovel into the net with his head under water. Captain Joey Colton tacked on another goal with two seconds left in the third quarter. The score put Harvard up 8-6, a lead the team would never relinquish.
Eventually the Crimson extended its lead to a comfortable 11-6 margin with just over four minutes left in the game. This definitive five-goal run gave Harvard its first home victory of the season after a jittery first half.
“I think we settled down at the half,” Tafur said. “We had a good talk with our coaches—they really focused us. Then we came out, we focused on our defense, and let the game go from there.”
MIT closed the gap with a late pair of goals, capitalizing on a suddenly flimsy Crimson defense. But the late rally was not enough, as Harvard went on to win, 11-8.
“A testament to MIT—they really fought for four quarters,” Tafur said. “We pulled out the win in the end, which is what we needed to stay in the hunt for good seeding in our conference play.”
BROWN 9, HARVARD 7
Earlier in the afternoon, Harvard found itself playing catch-up against Brown.
“It was a rough day,” Tafur said. “Two games pretty close together, so it was a test of our physical conditioning…. [Brown is] one of our biggest rivals. It’s always a grind-it-out game with them.”
The Crimson had stayed competitive throughout early play, coming back from a two-goal hole to even the score at 2-2. But Brown responded with a push of its own: three goals in four minutes to take a 5-2 advantage into halftime.
After the break, Harvard went on a 4-2 run, and a score from junior utility player Colin Chiapello brought the Crimson within one goal midway through the fourth quarter. However, the hosts never managed to take the lead, and the Bears surged ahead with a pair of late scores.
Minutes later, when the final whistle sounded, Brown climbed out of the pool as 9-7 victors.
Harvard had just hours to prepare for its next game against MIT, who had also lost to Brown earlier in the day.
“We came out on the short end of that [against Brown], which is fine,” Tafur said. “It’s a learning experience. [We] came back, pretty fired up tonight. We had a pretty good crowd, which is pleasing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team entered its Saturday afternoon contest against Cornell having been shut out only once this season, more than a month ago at Boston College. As the matchup with the Big Red drew on, however, the Crimson came face to face with the prospect of laying a goose egg for a second time this season.
No matter how the team attacked the Cornell goal, Big Red sophomore goalkeeper Meghan Kennedy—and on one occasion the crossbar—found a way to keep the ball out of the back of the net.
Harvard senior forward Midge Purce came close in the 74th minute when she smashed a free kick towards the upper left corner of the goal. Kennedy got her fingertips to the shot, however, pushing it off the crossbar and back into play.
Purce’s attacking partner and fellow senior Rachel Garcia pounced on the rebound with only Kennedy between her and the goal, but the forward could only direct a volleyed shot right at the Cornell goalkeeper.
Neither team would have a better chance, and after 110 minutes of play, the matchup between the Crimson and Big Red ended in a 0-0 stalemate.
The draw ended a five-game win streak for Harvard (7-3-1, 2-0-1 Ivy) and dropped the team to second in the conference standings. Of the two other teams who entered the weekend with a 2-0 league record, Columbia won in overtime to claim sole possession of first while Princeton lost and fell to third.
Cornell (3-6-2, 0-2-1), meanwhile, earned its first points in Ivy play this season while also bouncing back from a 5-0 loss to Penn last week.
“[Cornell] came out with a game plan that took us out of our rhythm and frustrated us,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “We didn’t respond well to what we saw in the first half, but credit to them for playing out the game and earning the draw.”
The first half was certainly difficult for Harvard, as it controlled possession but could only muster three shots. The Big Red defense made sure the ball stayed in middle third of the pitch for the majority of the 45 minutes, as the Crimson had trouble building up attacking movements in the box.
Cornell hardly fared better, launching only two shots in the same time period. Neither team logged a try on target until the 37th minute.
“We didn’t come out with the same kind of energy that we have had in other games,” Hamblin said. “In the long run, that probably hurt us with the overall result.”
After halftime, however, Harvard found its rhythm on offense and came close to scoring on multiple occasions. In addition to Purce’s free kick, the Crimson attack produced several other sequences that forced Kennedy into acrobatic saves. The team launched a total of 10 shots in the second half, four of which landed on target. But none found its way into the back of the net.
While the Harvard offense had trouble all afternoon, the defense kept the Big Red off the board with relative ease. Crimson senior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack had to make a mere two saves in the entirety of the contest, though the second save came on a dangerous one-on-one with Cornell freshman defender Autumn Brown.
“Lizzie was great in goal today, as she’s been all season,” said Crimson co-captain and defender Bailey Gary. “She keeps us going throughout the game, talking to us in the back.”
Harvard was able to put in an impressive defensive performance despite the absence of sophomore defender Alli Wiggins; junior midfielder Dani Stollar filled in nicely in her spot. Together, the back line limited the Big Red to just eight shots in 110 minutes.
“It seems that whoever needs to step in can fit in right away,” Gary said. “It’s nice that we can mix it up in the back and maintain a high standard of play.”
The Crimson now hopes that the offense can return to the level of play that characterized its recent five-game winning streak, during which Harvard scored 11 goals. However, only a few weeks remain in the season to put  together on both sides of the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Harvard women’s volleyball team came up empty handed last weekend in its second wave of Ivy League play, the squad hit the road once again hoping to improve its conference record.
The Crimson (4-10, 2-3 Ivy) managed to pick up one win in its return to Cambridge, splitting its two Columbus Day weekend matches by beating Brown (4-11, 2-3) on Friday afternoon before losing to Yale (11-3, 4-1) the following evening.
“I’m proud of the way we are growing as a team,” co-captain Corie Bain said. “I think that this weekend was kind of a solidifying experience for us....I’m starting to see the young girls learn what the Ivy League is all about.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Fueled by two runs book-ending the game, Brown thumped Harvard in a lopsided 25-10 first set. The Bears, recording a match-high .269 hitting percentage in the opening set, received major contributions from freshman outside hitter Makena Ehlert, who tallied nine points behind her serve in the first set alone.
The Crimson, however, would not capitulate another set for the rest of the contest, rattling off three consecutive games en route to victory.
“We did not show up ready to play...[but] we had the chance to turn it around,” Bain said. “It was nice to know that even if we start off weak, we can come back strong and win the game.”
Friday night’s win marks the fourth straight match between the two Ivy League foes ending in Harvard’s favor.
After a close 25-23 second frame followed by a more one-sided 25-15 third set, Harvard led Brown 23-20 in the fourth set when Bears coach Diane Short called a timeout in an effort to slow momentum and refocus her team. This proved to be an effective strategy, as the timeout iced the serve of Harvard sophomore middle blocker Jocelyn Meyer; two Brown kills then tied the set at 23.
Just when the outcome of the set looked to be in question, the Crimson’s Bain put down a kill and subsequently served the final point before assisting sophomore middle blocker Christina Cornelius on the match-ending kill.
“We’ve always said in Harvard volleyball that...anyone can take that fifth game,” Bain remarked. “I really pushed to have us win in four [games].”
While clawing its way back from the anomalous first set, Harvard benefitted greatly from freshman outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank’s game-high 14 kills. Likewise, the setting duo of Bain and freshman Erin McCarthy recorded a combined 43 assists and 21 digs. Bain also had 11 kills on the afternoon.
Freshman middle blocker Maclaine Fields played an efficient match, as she recorded nine kills without a single hitting error, which led to a team-high .450 hitting percentage.
On the other side of the net, Brown junior libero Melissa Cairo was all over the floor, digging 23 balls. In the front row, junior outside hitter Casey Tierney was the only Bear in double figures for kills, tallying 11.
YALE 3, HARVARD 1
Following three tight sets, Yale jumped out to an early lead in the fourth set, riding sophomore libero Kate Swanson’s serve until Harvard was forced to take a timeout. The Bulldogs’ lead climbed to as high as six points before the Crimson started shaving the deficit; the lead shrunk to five, four, three, then two points as the score crept closer to 25. Eventually, Harvard tied the game and even took the lead at 23-22.
After a block and a few kills, the Crimson found itself on the cusp of sending the match to a winner-take-all set. But suddenly the tides turned, and a side-out by Yale tied the game, at which point the Bulldogs rattled off two more points and seized victory.
“That was one of the first experiences that the team has had in a super tight game with such an emotionally established rival,” Bain acknowledged. “When we are up 27-26, we need to finish….We were making a lot of unforced errors.”
For the Crimson squad, Saturday’s match at Yale saw some of the same patterns from the Brown face-off the night before: the freshman and senior setting tandem of McCarthy and Bain put up impressive numbers in the back row once again, ending with a combined 47 assists and 20 digs. Burbank led with a match-high 16 kills and finished with 30 on the weekend, the most among her teammates. Meyer also pitched in with eight kills and a .467 hitting percentage.
For the Bulldogs, three players recorded double-digit kill totals—each with 11—and of particular note among them was freshman outside hitter Tristin Kott, who managed to do so without recording a single hitting error. Kott converted .688 of the sets she received into kills.
Whereas Harvard ran its offense with two setters, Yale relied solely on freshman Franny Arnautou to dish its sets. Arnautou finished with 43 assists on the night, topping her average assists per set output by three.
Harvard’s 35 hitting errors for the match—compared to Yale’s 15—depict the most telling statistic from the Crimson’s defeat at the hands of the Bulldogs. These giveaway points manifested themselves most clearly in the discrepancy between hitting percentages, where Yale outmatched Harvard .268 to .131.
Even while the sets ended in relatively close fashion, the Bulldogs’ front row played a markedly more efficient match than the Crimson’s, recording at least twice as many kills as errors in each set. The Crimson managed this feat only once, in the second game, which it won.
“[Minimizing unforced errors] is an easy way to avoid losing those super important points,” Bain said, “so I think we know what we need to focus on when we get into tight situations like that”
Due in large part to these errors at the net, Saturday marks only the second time all season that Harvard has conceded a match while recording more kills than its opponent.
Yale improved its untarnished home record to 5-0 with the closely contested win over Harvard on Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe crew team kicked off its fall season with a respectable showing at the 22nd annual Head of the Housatonic race held in Shelton, CT. Last year, Radcliffe did not compete in this race; however, this year, all four legs of the men and women’s crew teams traveled down to race. This regatta provided the teams with its first opportunity to match up against some of its toughest opponents before facing them on the home field at the Head of the Charles Regatta.
“[The Head of the Housatonic] was a solid start to our team's year. It’s always great to get out there and race, especially in a field as wide as we faced this weekend,” senior captain Abigail Parker said. “The Housatonic is only the first of many races, so leading up to it we got a chance to get in sequential lineups for the first time.”
With entries in the pair, coxed four and eight events, multiple athletes got the chance to represented the Black and White twice rowing down the 4.2 km course. Parker raced in both the eight and the pair events.
“We created lineups based on current rankings and had very slight taper,” junior Sofia Donnecke, who won the pair event and raced in the eight, said. “Since this race isn't as important, we didn't want to disrupt our training too much so we basically trained right up to it.”
Throughout the day, the conditions were ideal for rowing—overcast, light breezes, and calm waters. In the women’s eight event, Radcliffe fielded seven boats, both lightweights and heavyweights. In this first event, three of Radcliffe’s crews finished in top ten positions with the varsity eight securing a fourth place finish in a time of 14:09 behind Brown and two Yale boats.
“In terms of results, when we look at how our [eight] boats stacked up against Brown and Yale, we can see that we need to gain some speed to beat these competitors when we see them in the future,” Parker said. “Over the next two weeks, we will definitely focus on building some more speed before the Head [of the Charles]. With one head race under our belt, each of us knows what we can work on, individually and with our boats, to improve our performance next time.”
In the women’s coxed four event, the Black and White had three of its six crews finish in the top five. The highest placing four locked up a third place finish with a time of 15:38 falling just short of Yale’s 15:24 and Northeastern’s 15:36.
Finally, in the pair event, a mere ten boat race, the Radcliffe made up seven of the entries. The Black and White pairs managed to gain the top seven places in this race with the winning pair of junior Sofia Donnecke and sophomore Rafaela Stalph finishing in a time of 16:20.
This race gave the team its first opportunity to gauge its training progress relative to its competitors. While the focus of the training is geared toward peaking during the spring racing season, the fall races can be an early indicator of how well the team is likely to perform.
However, as opposed to the mostly straight two-kilometer racing courses in the spring, the fall races feature variably long courses replete with tight turns and narrow segments. So, the results from the Head of the Housatonic need to be viewed in this light since they are heavily contingent on the coxswain’s steering and athletes’ raw endurance.
“I think our coaches have been doing a great job working towards longer term goals,” said Donnecke. “We will do more immediate Race preparation for head of the Charles but the entire year of training is always focused on where we need to be in the spring.”
