After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Inn residents raised concerns that they were not immediately notified when students infected with mumps began occupying some rooms in their building—a strategy to help isolate the disease. Residents first received official notification at a town hall discussion held last Thursday, at least six days after one student with mumps moved into a room in the Inn.
In response to a recent mumps outbreak—which as of Wednesday numbers 13 confirmed cases—Harvard University Health Services has isolated some infected students at the Harvard Inn, a building typically used for undergraduates’ temporary or swing housing. 
According to Acting Dean of Dudley House Christopher M. Gilbert, Harvard uses several suites in the Inn for  “emergency housing” situations that may take place. Harvard does not notify residents of the Inn of the individuals who need emergency housing in order to maintain privacy, according to Gilbert.
“In order to protect the privacy of our students who need to avail themselves of such housing, the College does not notify Inn residents of the circumstances of who is using such suites and for what reasons,” Gilbert wrote in an emailed statement.
Still, several visiting students living in the Inn said they were upset that they were not immediately informed that students with mumps were residing nearby until after last week’s town hall discussion, which administrators held to share information.
“I understand that students need to be isolated... but several of students at the Inn, myself included, feel quite disappointed that we were not made aware,” Shriya Anand, a Harvard Inn resident and visiting student from University College London, said.
Carl A. Julsvoll, a visiting student from Norwegian University of Science and Technology living in the Inn, voiced similar concerns. Julsvoll said he only began to realize that mumps patients were living at the Inn after he saw bags of food deposited at certain doors.
For Matheus Campos, another visiting student and Inn resident studying in Sao Paulo, “it’s a big deal if [mumps patients] are staying in isolating rooms at the Inn,” but “letting the Inn residents know beforehand about it could also help.”
In response to concerns voiced by students like Anand, Campos, and Julsvoll, Gilbert and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke hosted a town hall meeting on March 10 to share additional information about the College and HUHS’ response to the mumps outbreak. According to Gilbert’s emailed statement, the College “has made it a priority to proactively communicate to those in the College impacted by the ongoing mumps response” and held the town hall in order to share information and “hear feedback.”
“Following the town hall discussion, the College has put in place additional protocols to address the concerns of the Inn community, including additional cleaning of common areas,” Gilbert wrote in an email.
HUHS director Paul Barreira sent a follow up email to Harvard Inn residents last Saturday to clarify procedures regarding the isolated students living in the building, writing that students with mumps “will be brought to available rooms wearing appropriate protective gear, including face masks, and will be isolated within those rooms until they are no longer infectious.”
Barreira added that students in isolation are provided food and other supplies, delivered under “strict procedures” to prevent contamination. “Those in isolation are not permitted to leave their rooms for any reason,” he wrote. And after isolated students have been cleared to leave their rooms,  “trained professionals wearing protective equipment” will clean them.
As for other on-campus housing including dorms, Dorm Crew Supervisor Paul L. Belmonte ’10 said Harvard’s Custodial Services is notified of any suites with reported student illnesses and “Dorm Crew employees have been instructed not to enter those suites until further notice.” Specially trained staff will clean such rooms.
According to Gilbert and College spokesperson Rachael Dane, Harvard is in compliance with Massachusetts Department of Public Health and Cambridge Public Health Department’s protocols for student self isolation.
Henry M.N. Brooks ’19, a student with mumps who previously stayed at the Inn in isolation said he felt concerns over students with mumps residing at the Inn may exaggerate the severity of the virus.
“I think that there wasn’t really any risk of other people getting [mumps],” Brooks said. “I understand their concerns… there’s a lot of misconceptions about [mumps]. People says it spreads through the air, but that’s all lies; it spreads through salivary contact.”
On Feb. 29, Barreira announced two students had contracted mumps. Two days later, he confirmed four more, and now, the number of confirmed cases is officially up to 13. In the days leading up to the College’s spring recess, both Barreira and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana advised students to take precaution in their travels.
Khurana and Barreira again reminded students in an email Thursday evening of precautions to prevent the spread of the virus after spring break.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’re trying to make history,” said senior guard/forward Shilpa Tummala. Making history is part of Harvard women’s basketball’s DNA; Harvard became the only team in men’s or women’s NCAA Tournament history to defeat a No. 1 seed as a No. 16 seed in 1998 after defeating Stanford.
The Crimson then became the first Ivy League team to record a victory in the Women’s National Invitational Tournament (WNIT) in 2012 before registering the fourth-largest comeback in Division I history this season against Yale.
Harvard (14-13, 9-5 Ivy) will look to continue that trend this Thursday as it begins its WNIT campaign on the road against Hofstra (22-8, 13-5 CAA). The Crimson has been invited to the country’s secondary postseason tournament for the sixth time in program history. No Harvard team, however, has ever progressed beyond the second round of any postseason competition.
VCU, Rutgers, and Georgia Tech join potential round two opponent Villanova as top 70 RPI opponents in the same quarterfinal bracket as the Crimson, which earned an automatic bid to the tournament by virtue of being the top-ranked Ancient Eight squad not in the NCAA Tournament—Penn got in via the conference title while second-placed Princeton grabbed an at-large bid.
“The WNIT is getting better and better and better every year,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “The tournament is a pretty darn good tournament now, and anything can happen. I look at the four teams in our little bracket and I feel good against all of them.
In order to get a shot at the tournament’s elite, Harvard will first have to see off the Pride, who it defeated just four years ago in this round of the WNIT. The Crimson leads the overall head-to-head series, 5-3.
Harvard enters the tournament on the back of defeats to the Quakers and Tigers on the regular season’s last weekend but are buoyed by the return of freshman guard Nani Redford, who missed those games due to illness.
Hofstra relies heavily on the play of its front court, with forwards Kelly Loftus and Ashunae Durant leading the team with 12.6 and 11.6 points per game respectively. 6’2” center Anjie White, who averaged over 13 rebounds per 40 minutes, also figures to feature heavily against the undersized Crimson.
“I think our challenge is keeping them off the boards,” Delaney-Smith said. “They’re a very good rebounding team, particularly [Durant], she’s very athletic and does a lot of early rebounding work… AnnMarie isn’t known for her box out, we’re not powerful and they are.”
This is not the first time Harvard has come up against a “forest” of formidable forwards, however, with Penn’s duo of Sydney Stipanovich and Michelle Nwokedi garnering much of the team’s attention in both matchups with the Quakers.
“The inside strength of the Ivy League is really good and we played against some of the best frontcourt duos in the country,” Tummala said, “so I think that we’re pretty much as prepared as we can get to play against Hofstra’s interior post players.”
The Crimson will look to captain and leading scorer AnnMarie Healy to lead the way once again; the Minnesota native finished the season with 16.3 points per game while shooting an impressive 51.0 percent from the field, ranked 61st in the nation. She faces a tough Pride interior that blocks 4.5 shots a game while allowing opponents to shoot just 36.2% from the field.
“We have AnnMarie on the inside,” Tummala said, “whose turnaround is nearly unstoppable across the country. I think that she’s going to continue to do what she does and we need to keep getting her the ball.”
Harvard also has a slight edge on the perimeter, with Tummala, captain Kit Metoyer, and the rest of the team shooting 31.5% from the beyond the arc compared to Hofstra’s 30.8%. While the Crimson’s projected starting lineup is smaller than the Pride’s, size isn’t of much concern for the team.
“I think Shilpa is going to be at the 4, and is going to be a matchup consideration for them,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think their big running the floor with AnnMarie is going to be a consideration for them…. If they get us to play at a fast, frenetic pace, that’s where we won’t be at our best. If we trust each other and the system, then they’re going to be in trouble.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team ended its four-game losing streak with a two-game series sweep against Massachusetts at Jack Russell Memorial Stadium, the former spring training home of the Phillies, in Clearwater, Fla. On Tuesday, dominant pitching led the Crimson (4-5) to the victory while the next day the team’s offense took charge in outpacing the Minutemen (1-7). Sophomore utilityman Matt Rothenberg led Harvard with four RBIs over the two days.
“It was great to get back on the winning track,” captain Matt Sanders said. “It was really fun to go down to Gainesville and compete there but it was nice to play against UMass and get a couple wins.”
HARVARD, 9, MASSACHUSETTS, 5
The Crimson scattered its nine runs over three big rallies against UMass pitching. Harvard set the tone with a three-run first inning, headlined by a Mitch Klug triple to start the frame and two RBIs from Rothenberg. The Minutemen got two back in the bottom half and tied the game at three in the third, but the Crimson broke the game open in its four-run fourth inning.
“Guys are getting on base and I’m working myself into some favorable counts and not really trying to do a whole lot,” Rothenberg said. “I’m just trying to get the bat on the ball and go gap to gap, and I’ve been finding some holes.”
Sophomore third baseman John Fallon and freshman first baseman Patrick McColl each drove in two runs in the frame. The corners in Harvard’s infield have combined to drive in 17 of the team’s 37 runs this season. The Crimson tacked on two more in the seventh after a Rothenberg triple and Josh Ellis single.
“It gives all your pitchers confidence going out there on the mound,” Sanders said. “It allows you to send a young guy out there and let him work through four or five innings knowing your offense is going to continue to score runs.”
Freshman Simon Rosenblum-Larsen gave Harvard five innings in his first collegiate start. The righty struck out five and surrendered three runs (one earned). Sophomore Dylan Combs threw a one-two-three sixth inning and has yet to allow an earned run this season.
HARVARD, 5, MASSACHUSETTS, 1
A Crimson freshman pitcher shut down UMass through the first five innings of Tuesday’s game while three seniors were equally effective in closing out the victory. First-year Kevin Stone earned his first collegiate victory after throwing five innings of scoreless ball. The Stamford, Conn. native struck out two and surrendered just four hits. With Stone in the game, no UMass player got past second base.
Harvard manufactured a run in the first after a Minuteman error and doubled its lead in the fifth on a Fallon four-bagger. It was the fourth of the season for the sophomore, who leads the team in home runs, RBIs, and runs scored. The two runs would prove to be all that the Harvard pitching staff would need.
“It’s been fun, [Conor, John, and I] hitting in the middle of the order,” Rothenberg said. “It’s been good to work some good at-bats and drive in some runs. We’re all just trying to do what we can to put some runs on the board, play some good defense, and go from there.”
Sanders relieved Stone in the sixth and surrendered UMass’ only run on a Cooper Mrowka sac fly. However, sophomore rightfielder Conor Quinn answered with a homer to start the sixth and freshman Devan Peterson drove in Rothenberg later in the frame. Sanders responded with an eventful top of the seventh as the captain hit UMass’ John Avallone with a pitch but was able to avoid any damage.
Rothenberg grew the Crimson’s lead to four with an RBI single in the eighth. Senior T.J. Laurisch allowed only one hit in the eighth while classmate Sean O’Neill threw a perfect ninth to complete the sweep.
“It really is a great mix,” Sanders said. “We have younger guys on the front end and it’s great to have them go out there. In terms of closing games out and pitching out some of those later innings, we have plenty of experience coming out of the bullpen which is great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Offensive contributions from a variety of hitters and dominant pitching from both the starters and the bullpen led Harvard softball (8-6) to four wins at the Loyola Marymount Tournament in Los Angeles, Calif.
“Every single game was a real team effort,” senior Rachel Halperin said. “Our coach has been moving people around a lot. It’s a really dynamic lineup.”
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 6, HARVARD 4
The Crimson concluded the tournament with a loss against the host Lions (17-8) as Loyola Marymount jumped out to a 6-0 lead in the first four innings behind eight hits, including three doubles.
Lions junior Rachael Farrington shut out Harvard in the game’s first six innings before sophomore Maddy Kaplan ripped a two-RBI single in the seventh, which was quickly followed by a two-run home run off the bat of junior Catherine Callaway.
The last-inning comeback fell short, however, as Harvard was unable to overcome Loyola Marymount’s six-run lead.
HARVARD 5, FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON 2
Two doubles and three runs batted in from Callaway provided the offensive spark that pushed the Crimson past Fairleigh Dickinson (2-10) for the second straight game.
Captain Morgan Groom was one out away from recording a complete-game win. The senior from Lowell, Mich. struck out 10 Knights, a career high, while only allowing two runs to cross the plate.
“I think [junior] Taylor Cabe and Groom have been really great,” Halperin said. “They’re very consistent, and I think that has allowed the offense to really lock in and win some games for us, too.”
HARVARD 6, FAIRLEIGH DICKINSON 1
Freshman Meagan Lantz went deep twice and drove in four, leading Harvard to its third win in Los Angeles. The pair of home runs were the first in the Parkland, Fla. native’s collegiate career.
Cabe improved her record to 6-2 with another win in the circle. In her third appearance of the tournament, the righthander tossed five shutout innings, allowing only two hits and striking out three.
Harvard took advantage of its offensive opportunities in its first game against Fairleigh Dickinson, only stranding two runners throughout the game.
MONMOUTH 6, HARVARD 5
Harvard entered the bottom of the seventh inning with a one-run lead, needing only three outs to defeat Monmouth (8-7) for the second time in Los Angeles. Instead, the Hawks rallied in the final frame, plating two runs and earning a walk-off victory.
A passed ball and a throwing error allowed Monmouth freshman Jasmine Higa to cross the plate with the winning run.
Three of Harvard’s runs came off the bat of senior Haley Davis, who hit a three-run home run in the second inning, her first round-tripper of the season.
HARVARD 5, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3
A triple from Callaway in the top of the seventh was the deciding factor in the Crimson’s first contest against Loyola Marymount.
The second baseman took a pitch from Lions junior Andy Wellins and ripped it into right field, and junior Savannah Bradley and freshman Rhianna Rich came around to score the go-ahead runs.
Cabe pitched seven strong innings to earn the win against the Lions. The Boiling Springs, S.C. native struck out six and only walked one.
Harvard piled up 11 hits, including three doubles and a triple. Callaway, junior Giana Panariello, and Davis each had two hits.
“Not only do we have nine people in the lineup that can perform, but we also have people on the bench who provide for us in tough situations,” Groom said. “Offensively, we’re very all-around as a team.”
HARVARD 5, MONMOUTH 4
In the Crimson’s first game of the Loyola Marymount Tournament, Harvard scraped out a one-run win against Monmouth.
Both teams had four-run innings earlier in the game, but it was an RBI single in the fourth frame by Rich that put the Crimson on top for good.
Captain Zoe Galindo was three-for-three with a double and two runs batted in.
Cabe notched her first of three wins in Los Angeles with a three-inning relief effort. The righthander only allowed one baserunner in her three innings of work.
