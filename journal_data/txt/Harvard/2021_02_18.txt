After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s easy to be lured by false remembrances when thinking of Harvard’s history — to be drawn in by Harvard’s ostensibly illustrious founding, when the early institution charted its course through the churning Western world guided by nothing but the pursuit of truth and knowledge. The preeminence of this enchanting lore — an image that the University often propounds itself — may even help explain Harvard’s enduring esteem and renowned position today. Yet this portrait is, on many levels, a false one.
In our world, for any institution with a past that spans as long as Harvard’s, dark chapters are likely. For Harvard, chief among these is the University’s depraved involvement in the institution of slavery — something that it has only recently begun to deeply grapple with.
Thankfully, the University’s long-overdue explorations are finally beginning to gain some real momentum. After a review of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology found the remains of at least 15 individuals of African descent who were likely alive during the time of American slavery, the University formed a steering committee designed to thoroughly survey the human remains across all Harvard museums.
This is an important step. Understanding the historical context and lives of these individuals is essential, and we are pleased by the committee’s commitment to actively exploring the presentation and handling of these sensitive remains. Firmly solidifying our faith, too, is the fact that the committee’s plans don’t stop with a singular, albeit important, examination of these remains. The committee has instead embedded broader, actionable plans within their mission, promising to develop comprehensive policies on the “collection, display, and ethical stewardship” of human remains. Undertakings like these actively widen the committee's task to determining what the right thing to do, if any, with these remains is.
We carry sincere confidence that the members of the committee have — and will continue to – pour into the project the level of thought and effort it deserves, probing both the immediate question of what to do with the remains, as well as the broader question of how our University should responsibly interrogate its connections to slavery.
We throw our support behind the committee and urge the University to do the same, plus actively build upon these efforts. One potential avenue for such advancement, as we have advocated for in the past, is to cultivate permanent physical space dedicated to meaningful reflection upon Harvard’s legacy of slavery. A space for such reflection would not only serve as a powerful reminder of our past, but could stir the minds of the Harvard affiliates and any visitors it finds, reminding them of the harm Harvard has caused in the past and work left to be done in the future.
Finally, the University needs to look beyond initiatives focused on spaces and reflection as it moves forward. Without question, there lies inherent value in the committee’s attention to the more abstract aspects of justice; still, the University’s reckoning with its ties to slavery cannot end with symbolism. It is the University’s responsibility to students, faculty, staff, and alumni — of the troubled past, of the contemplative present, and of the unmapped future — to examine the concrete steps it can take to help atone for our cruel history.
As University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote himself in his email announcing the formation of the steering committee, we must make sure that we never place “academic enterprise above respect for the dead and human decency.” This is true not only within the context of Harvard’s troubling human remains collection but also in any research or initiative undertaken at Harvard and beyond. When we dig into the past, we should in part be working to right the wrongs of that past. But we also need to vigilantly move forward — to gain insight and understanding, to do better, and to cultivate new atmospheres that we can look at with comfort and pride. The Peabody’s latest initiative is an exceptional step towards this end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As temperatures in the Northeast remain unforgiving and Cambridge residents bundle up, need is on the rise among the city’s homeless population — and the situation is only worsened by the pressure to de-densify shelters during the pandemic. Fortunately, the city has finally heard and listened to the oft-ignored calls of the people living on its frigid streets: Prompted by local organizers, including Harvard student activists, the Cambridge City Council voted earlier this month to rent non-congregate homeless shelter space from the New England School of English.
The collaborative efforts of the community mobilizing behind this vote serve as a wondrous testament to the value of wielding collective action to meet the seemingly insurmountable challenges of the present — ultimately, such efforts ought to be sustained and built upon moving forward. The latest move was inspired by a petition — signed by 121 individuals experiencing homelessness themselves — and the New England School of English, which took the initiative to reach out to the City Council last April and offered its single-room dorms for utilization as temporary, non-congregate shelter space. These ventures mark a remarkable team effort — one with more than 121 once-overlooked voices finally heard.
These efforts gain even deeper value when understood within the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Of course, non-congregate shelters are of tremendous worth in any time and place, as they offer essential levels of privacy and dignity to homeless individuals, reduce their vulnerability, and increase their comfort. But they’re also more important than ever right now, as the close quarters of congregate shelters have proven to be dangerous, if not fatal, during the pandemic. In response to such difficulties, growing numbers of congregate shelters have been forced to lower capacity limits and turn away individuals due to public health concerns, only exacerbating the amount of need. Indeed, the dwindling and dangerous role of congregate shelters provokes the need for new levels of thought and inventiveness in our community’s work in supporting its most vulnerable — a task that the proponents of the City Council’s vote have risen to.
This local news also takes place against a federal backdrop: In late January, President Joe Biden signed an executive order guaranteeing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, also known as FEMA, would reimburse municipalities for 100 percent of their spending on the establishment of non-congregate shelters.
The new policy, valid until September 30, 2021, is extremely promising. It has the potential to prove that active and compassionate governance can successfully tackle our homelessness epidemic; that leaving our citizens un-housed and vulnerable is a policy choice, not an immutable societal feature. We encourage all municipalities — including our own — to take full advantage of the newfound federal support and to act boldly and swiftly to help those in need of housing.
In the specific case of the Cambridge community, we celebrate the progress made by the council but, as usual, push for more. As the city continues to develop long-term options for housing, we encourage them to amplify the voices of unhoused individuals in order to best address their needs, acknowledging that each residents’ circumstances will be unique to them and that their lived experiences will be crucial to informing good policy.
We ask the very same thing from Harvard: Aim higher and push harder. Our current community engagement pales in comparison to the New England School of English's generosity. Though we have ties to two local homeless shelters — the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y Harvard Square — both are primarily student-run, focusing on individual rather than institutional commitments. We hope our peers’ boldness inspires Harvard to expand its own efforts and increase our positive footprint on the local community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Republican Congress Members,
Last month, you experienced what was likely your first life-threatening event at work — a lockdown due to an active threat. We, the students of America, would like to welcome you to our club. It seems like our schools in the United States are far more prepared to endure an attack than the Capitol, so I figured you could use some help from the students — from the kindergartners at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, to the high school students at Saugus High School in California.
After years of fearing for our lives the moment we step onto school property, we’ve learned a couple of lessons.
Do not leave a congressional session in a huge crowd: It’s an easy target. Even if a fire alarm begins to ring, wait for confirmation that a fire is occurring before exiting the building in case someone exercising their Second Amendment right is waiting for you in the hallway. If you get a warning of a threat in the building, you should barricade the doors with desks and bookshelves, arm yourselves with scissors, and turn off the lights. In elementary school, we tell the little kids that they can only play quiet games. The silence knowing danger may be around the corner is deafening.
If the Secret Service notifies you of the danger and you have windows in your room, hop out the window and start running. However, what if there are no windows, and a very fine person enters your chambers despite your makeshift barricades? It depends. Our schools usually tell the kindergartners to run in zig-zag lines; it makes it a little harder to shoot at them.
These are tips routinely taught to kindergartners, middle schoolers, and high schoolers. I hope you never have to find them useful.
After all, the preferred order of business would be to at least attempt to solve the problem of school and mass shootings through policy-making. However, many of you with the power to do so often only offer your thoughts and prayers, not change. Could it be the National Rifle Association’s near 30 million dollars in the GOP’s pockets?
To the members of Congress who allow such NRA donations to create a conflict of interest between their pocketbooks and the lives of American students, I am disappointed.
The constant lobbying of the NRA against necessary laws to protect American students from shootings is hurting American society. Congress, especially members of the GOP, could have saved thousands of lives if the NRA’s money never appeared in legislators’ pockets. The GOP seems to be beholden to the will of the NRA, and this association is staining and limiting the good your party has and will accomplish.
In 2016, 98.4 percent of all NRA donations were to House Republicans. Ironically, in 2019, House Republicans were unanimously pro-life. These positions are paradoxical. The National Right to Life Committee claims to protect and defend “the right to life of every innocent human being from the beginning of life to natural death.” American lives should be well protected everywhere in the United States, especially in classrooms. If you are actually pro-life, change your actions to align with what that truly entails.
With every part of my being, I’m pleading with you to prove that you care about students’ well-being. I implore you to at least lighten your pockets from NRA contributions and donate your money, time, and effort to students who have experienced these shootings. I urge you to care for the safety of students will at the very least equal your passion for guns.
You’ve gone through a horrifying event that no one should endure, not Congress members nor kindergartners. Let’s make sure it doesn’t happen again.
So to the Republican members of Congress, I am so glad that you are safe. But many students around the U.S. have not been so lucky. I hope that many of you will contemplate your political decisions pertaining to gun regulations after knowing how it feels to be scared to go to work.
For those of you who decide to remain blinded by money, I hope you are willing to stare into the eyes of a child, once filled with innocence and happiness, now replaced by terror and fear, and say: Run in zig-zag lines.
Respectfully,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black girl thought is a pent up thought that rumbles in my belly, and I feel overwhelmed by where to start in putting it to words. It’s the convergence of my own experiences with an emerging collective understanding of Black women’s reality; an intersectional understanding of the world we have all been living.
The pandemic has corresponded with new attention to the various issues of anti-Blackness that rampage the world: police brutality and health disparities among countless others. However, being a Black person, a Black woman, living in this day and age, I’m never surprised by what others are finding revelatory. What did surprise me, however, was having my understanding of what I was witnessing and experiencing outwardly communicated — because the divide between myself and the rest of the world can sometimes be invisible and yet so apparent.
For many, 2020 was an introduction into the lives of Black people, and yet, within this new understanding, there is still a disconnect between the manners in which violence against Black people and violence against Black women are discussed. The brutality that took place against George Floyd resulted in a sea of artwork that covered my Instagram page, but Breonna Taylor’s murder has become memes on my peers’ TikToks. As I scrolled through pages of informative messages on ways to support the families of Ahmaud Arbery and Elijah McClain, Breonna Taylor’s name was made into the punchline to a joke, into a “funny” song; her death, just a commodity.
There is an uneasy feeling that comes from increasingly being asked “What can I do?” by my non-Black peers when the question itself is so draining to answer.
In my first advisee meeting as a freshman, I remember being with my family during Move-In Day, sitting in on a Zoom call, and being introduced to some members of my class for the first time. After introducing ourselves, there was a weight added to the Zoom room when we began to discuss the protests that were occurring all around us.
When my proctor asked, “How did you feel during this time? What can we do?” the silence was deafening, though my mind was active with thoughts and ideas and feelings. Either way, I did not want to speak first. I did not want to introduce myself with the premise that I am not just a peer or a classmate, but a Black Woman who is directly impacted by these realities. Yet I noted that I spoke for approximately 80 percent of the conversation. My mom asked me who I was speaking with, considering the toll of the issues discussed, and I told her “my entryway.”
Black women are so often forced into the position of a laborer, whether it be in the context of my entryway implicitly relying on me to explain how to address racism in an institution that I have just entered, or when my White peers text me asking: Why I haven’t posted, why I haven’t addressed my accounts with these structures, what can they do to help?
The first thing to do is recognize what your relationship with Black women is, specifically the ways in which it is likely often transactional and labor-inducing in manners that can only create violence towards us.
When asked “What can I do?,” what you are really asking is for me to try and reposition you in the world. I can’t do that. The important thing to accept is that there is nothing you can do that will remove you from your positionality as someone not a Black woman.
Instead, you must consciously make decisions that prioritize Black women. Supporting Black women is not just being educated by us and putting demands on us while we are tired, but it is consistently shielding us at our strongest and weakest moments without recognition.
I want to own my production, my creativity, my critical thinking. Numerous times I have had to speak to my school, to my white classmates about “How to be anti-racist?” “How to be a good ally?” just for them to thank me, appear benevolent, then turn and continue to create the same problems I taught them to resolve. Never do I get to ask myself, “What do I really want to say?” because I am constantly expected to answer everyone else’s demands before my own.
My thoughts are not commodities for others to use, gleaning social capital and a stamp of approval. Minding intersectionality — the compounding of power structures that impact the lived experience of Black women and so many others — is essential not just for you who are reading this, but for everyone. The ability to create demands, such as what I experienced in my entryway meeting, on another person — the privilege to ignore the violence that Black women face, the ability to stomach countless images and videos of Black trauma and death — all come from a position of power. This power is what allows non-Black Women to make demands on us; where one can leverage, in this case, their gender, their race, and ultimately their power and privilege, against another.
Consider this column my own form of protest. Within this protest, I want to unveil the joys, the sadness, the anger, the fear, and love that Black women experience when operating through this world, and writing creates a space where I can bring these dimensionalities to you. My storytelling is an act of resistance because ultimately, my writing is a telling of who I am: commodifiable for no one.
I write these thoughts to create a connection. Though we may be worlds apart or sharing the same spaces, this column is the creation of a new space. A bridge.
This bridge will allow me and my Black womanhood to grow and expand and intersect with the various rivers of thought and experience it may come across. I hope you travel along with me.

As part of the Visions category, a design from Toby R. Ma.
As with many other holidays in the past year, last Friday’s Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations were unlike any from years past. All across the United States, lockdown and gathering restrictions remain in place, while the Chinese government restricted the annual migration of hundreds of millions of its citizens, who normally travel home to celebrate the New Year with their families. While some places held smaller celebrations, the general atmosphere of the holiday is very much absent.
As someone born in the U.S. to Chinese immigrants, my Chinese New Year celebrations were always small, usually just between my parents, brother, and me. However, living in a single dorm on a limited-capacity campus during a global pandemic, I feel especially isolated from friends and family. It has only been a few years since I last visited my relatives in China, but nonetheless I feel more disconnected from them — so much has changed in the time that has elapsed.
Based on some online horoscopes, the Year of the Metal Ox will be defined by hard work and many obstacles, but also be a year when one’s efforts will ultimately be rewarded. During a time that has already tested many of us, let’s hope our endeavors will succeed, and we can return to a time where we can gather again, as a family.

As I walk from Copley Square to the Public Garden on a winter Friday, I must look to passersby like a typical pandemic-era pedestrian: hat on, mask up, earbuds in. But in fact, I am not merely out for a stroll; I am enjoying the closest to live theater I’ve experienced in over a year, Lyric Stage Company’s Walking Plays.
Lyric Stage is Boston’s oldest professional theatre company. In a normal year, it produces seven shows each season, ranging from musicals to new plays. In the Boston theater scene, Lyric Stage is particularly known for its intimate feel: Audience members surround the small stage on three sides, and there is usually no raised platform separating the actors from the audience, creating a uniquely immersive experience.
But the pandemic changed everything. When public health restrictions made live theater impossible, Lyric Stage had to pivot to remote programming. For an organization normally committed to supporting Boston artists and offering intimate experiences, the challenge required reordering priorities.
“We are an organization that gathers people together in a physical space and promotes empathy and conversations through the storytelling that we do,” reflects Matt Chapuran, Executive Director of Lyric Stage. “And so we had to take a step back and ask ourselves what’'s the service that we wanted to provide in this moment?”
While other theater companies tried to adapt plays for a Zoom setting, Lyric was reluctant to entertain audiences through a screen. “I think that there’s also an inherent challenge for live theater organizations if you start to go online too much,” says Chapuran. “At a certain point you’re reinventing television.” Instead, Lyric hoped to entertain without adding screen time, by encouraging audiences to step into the city.
Thus, the genesis of the Walking Plays: Lyric chose a route through the city, then commissioned six Boston-based playwrights to create short audio plays designed for audience members to listen to while walking each segment. Listeners virtually follow the characters in the play, and can spot landmarks referenced in real time. Each playwright was instructed to carry over a character from the previous play, creating a sense of continuity, though not of linear progression.
Only two plays have been released so far, but all six will be available by mid-May, when Lyric hopes warmer weather will encourage more participation. Eventually, audience members will be able to listen to all six plays back-t0-back, totalling an hour-and-a-half walk from Copley Square to Back Bay.
To prepare for my Walking Plays experience, I print out the map available on Lyric’s website, find the plays on its Soundcloud, and head down to Copley Square. The map shows a clear route through the city, with numbered landmarks along the way — a gold dome, a fountain, a statue. As a Boston neophyte, I still need to consult my compass app to orient myself, but I eventually locate the corner of Dartmouth St. and St. James Ave. and press play.
The first play, by David L. Valdes, is entitled “Paying Attention” and follows Yaya, a trans woman of color, and her girlfriend, T, as they walk through the city in the summer of 2020. Along the way, the couple pass a Black Lives Matter protest, which prompts them to discuss issues of social change and privilege.
In developing the play, Valdes himself walked the prescribed route over the summer, making observations along the way. “I actually didn’t go down with any particular agenda of what story I wanted to tell,” he says. “I wanted to let the walk tell me.” He noticed new Boston landmarks and passed a Black Lives Matter protest, which ultimately inspired the themes of social change in his play.
Immediately, I feel like I’m walking with Yaya and T. T points out the Boston Public Library, engraved with names of famous thinkers. I look to my left — there it is. I read the names in real time with her voice, before crossing the street — “Quick, we’ve got the light!” says T in my ear. I nearly jump at the sound of a car horn, before realizing it’s part of the play. It’s a novel combination of imagination and reality: All that is missing are the actors’ physical forms.
The play ends at the Boston Public Garden, and I switch tracks to the second play: “Monster in the Sky,” by Ginger Lazarus. The play takes me back to a “foggy weekday in October, 2001,” and follows an 11-year-old Yaya and her friend on a class trip, shortly after 9/11.
Along the way, they find landmarks and discuss issues of uncertainty and gender identity, culminating with Yaya coming out as trans to her friend. I can barely keep up as the characters reference specific sights: a swan pond, cone-shaped hedges, a remarkably horizontal tree branch. “It’s sort of a little love letter to the city,” quips Lazarus, a life-long Boston resident.
Lyric hopes that the plays can be more than guided walking tours by offering an intimate experience dedicated to “exploring the private moments we experience in public,” according to their website.
“You sometimes find you’re having incredibly private conversations under the cloak of the city,” says Courtney A. O’Connor, Lyric’s Artistic Director. “It allows you sometimes an openness and vulnerability that, when you’re in a quiet, private space, can be more terrifying.” O’Connor hopes the plays create moments of vulnerability between the characters, and that listeners, by “eavesdropping,” experience that intimacy, too.
The unique listener experience — just you and your earbuds — is intended to create intimacy, as well. “That gap of you in your seat, watching from afar, is gone,” says Valdes. “Instead, the person is inside your head. So there is a real immediacy and warmth to it.”
The Walking Plays also offer a uniquely accessible way to consume theater: free downloads. This accessibility is in line with Lyric’s long-standing goal of “service” to “the city of Boston and all of its neighborhoods,” according to Chapuran. To that end, Lyric is considering expanding Walking Plays to more neighborhoods of Boston, even post-pandemic.
I walk down Winter St. toward Downtown Crossing as the play comes to a close. Yaya and her friend finish their day with lunch at a hot dog cart; sadly, I don’t see one around. As the audio quiets, the sounds of the city filter back in, and the streets are no longer a stage. But I remember the title of the first play — “Paying Attention” — and perk back up.
Valdes says he hopes listeners will come away from his play “both appreciating the city itself, but also thinking about how every person they’re passing is a story.” So I pay attention on my walk back — to the man on the phone with smiling eyes, to the girl wandering with a large suitcase, to the couple sharing a forehead kiss through their masks — and wonder what private moments they’re experiencing, and what their stories are.

Featuring 48 minutes of animated avocados, smooth jazz, and an expert’s perspective on aphrodisiacs — it’s Thursday night at Coleslaw’s Corner. Coleslaw, a Boston-based drag queen, dons a spiked collar and purple lipstick before changing into a tutu and apron to dive into the myths and truths behind the sensuality of food, the subject of tonight’s show.
Coleslaw’s performance is part of the Boston Museum of Science’s SubSpace programming, an initiative marketed “for adults looking for something different” to offer a “new wave of nightlife” in the city. Normally used to educate school groups about the stars, entertainment experiences such as an audio-visual tribute to David Bowie take over the 57-foot dome and surround sound speakers when night falls. Think “La La Land,” but less corny. Starting in 2016, “Subspace” has continuously expanded its programming, hosting events like “Fake Science with ImprovBoston” and a live synesthetic orchestra. The mission is all about being “the Museum’s experimental playground.”
One such experimental event is Coleslaw’s Corner. With a spotlight on Boston’s brightest stars of drag, Coleslaw’s Corner has been a stronghold of after hours offerings at the Museum for the past two years, often selling out all 209 seats of the planetarium.
Coleslaw was a SubSpace regular before the pandemic, beginning in 2018 as a host for “just an ordinary drag show,” she explains. As Coleslaw’s Corner evolved, with years of experience as a DJ and entertainer behind her, the SubSpace event became story-driven, immersing the audience with custom visuals that spanned the ceiling of the planetarium. Though Coleslaw’s live shows were put on hold last spring due to the pandemic, she has since shifted online with a virtual conversation series called “Coleslaw’s Corner: Science in Drag.” The show was born, along with a number of free virtual SubSpace events focused on education. They’ve hosted a Fortnite Tournament and “A Night of Mindfulness Meditation.” But Coleslaw’s web series is unlike anything else.
This week, joined by hundreds of viewers on Youtube, Coleslaw hosted her fourth virtual show. She opened — “reporting live from my studio boudoir” — before bringing in guest Martha Hopkins, author of “InterCourses: An Aphrodisiac Cookbook.” The video premiered for Valentine's Day, using the palpable love in the air to discuss sensuality in French Toast baked in honey pecan sauce. But despite the sexy conversation Hopkins brought to the table, Coleslaw is the undeniable star of the show.
Coleslaw has not shied away from using her platform to take on more serious missions as well. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement that arose this summer, Coleslaw’s Corner hosted Sarah Weiner, Education Associate at the Museum of Science, to ask “What contributions have women, people of color, and the BGLTQ community made to STEM and how have they shaped our world today?” In the video, the SubSpace audience was able to “learn about the past you didn’t study in school and meet the underrepresented voices who built the pillars of science.” This focus on underreported histories is something that Coleslaw wants to continue exploring with co-producer James Monroe at the Museum. Monroe explains how powerful it is that people can watch her and “really learn something important, as opposed to something silly.”
Coleslaw’s Corner isn’t the first event to combine drag performance with education. First established in San Francisco, Drag Queen Story Hour (DQSH) seeks to capture childhood imagination and discuss gender fluidity through readings in libraries, schools, and bookstores. It gives the kids in the audience “glamorous, positive, and unabashedly queer role models,” as described on the Facebook page for Virtual Drag Story Hour. The local Boston chapter of DQSH hosted two virtual events this summer, staying committed to providing children a space to explore their gender identities.
Coleslaw’s Corner joins a wide array of other LGBTQ people blurring the lines between education and entertainment: projects like Youtuber ContraPoints’ video series investigating current social issues and Jonathan Van Ness’s “Getting Curious” podcast. Through their platforms, it’s more than what the creators are saying, it’s how they’re saying it — each of their personalities centered alongside the conversation. Van Ness even taped a live episode of “Getting Curious” as part of the 2018 SubSpace season.
Beyond her web series, Coleslaw also hosts The Serve Network’s digital Drag shows weekly on Twitch — each episode’s theme is a decade in history. Featuring “an ever-rotating array of Drag artists from around the world,” Coleslaw and The Serve team have kept the spirit of performance alive each Monday evening.
No matter what she’s up to, Coleslaw’s work has kept pushing the boundaries of genre and medium — disrupting the line between drag show and webinar. Having already covered topics from animals to space to the history of science, Coleslaw assured that “Science in Drag” will be returning live at the planetarium when the time comes, hinting that “the cogs have been turning.” In the age of a new normal, the power of drag is seemingly limitless in Coleslaw’s hands.

In the last three months, two restaurants with seemingly contrasting visions for the future of food have opened in Harvard Square: Source Restaurant, a pizzeria serving Neapolitan pies and handmade pasta made from hyper-locally sourced ingredients, and Spyce, a healthy and fast-casual takeout spot specializing in bowls and salads made by robots in their Infinite Kitchen.
Across from Johnson Gate and a little ways down Church Street lies Source, which opened in November 2020.
“Sourcing local has slowly progressed over the last 10 years,” says Daniel P. Roughan, Source’s owner. “We’re trying to source hyper-local. ‘Local’ can mean within 500 miles, whereas we’re getting the majority of our meat and produce from 30 minutes away.”
Step into Source and you’ll find an atmosphere that reflects the rustic menu: exposed brick walls, reclaimed wood tables and stools, a mural of a rooster painted on the wall facing the bar, and a pizza oven manned by executive chef Brian L. Kevorkian.
At $16 for a margherita pizza, the costs of locally-sourced ingredients result in pies that don’t come cheap. But for Roughan and Kevorkian, sourcing local is worth the expense.
“When I buy my chicken, I’m supporting that farmer’s family,” Roughan says. “It costs money because he’s paying for his labor, he’s paying for all of his facilities.” And, as Kevorkian notes, food tastes better when made with higher quality ingredients.
Down the street and around the corner is another new restaurant, Spyce, whose Harvard Square location opened in January 2021. Outfitted with a superheated steamer and a carbon steel plancha, the robotic Infinite Kitchen cooks and steams ingredients to precisely fit customers’ orders. Spyce’s interior likewise reflects its concept: high ceilings, white floors and white walls, metal counters accented with light wood, and modern stations where customers can order on an iPad. Behind clear glass on the back wall, customers can watch tall metal tubes dispensing ingredients onto their bowl as it moves down a conveyor belt.
“Automation enables us to put our labor into actually procuring fresh ingredients, chopping, marinating, and seasoning in-house,” Spyce CEO and co-founder Michael Farid says. “That way we can make the food as fresh as possible as opposed to buying pre-processed or pre-done ingredients to save the labor.”
Despite their vastly different styles and atmospheres, Source and Spyce have a surprising amount in common — both restaurants are breaking in novel and eco-friendly consumer-centric models.
At Source, sustainability is implicit in the hyper-local sourcing model that supports small farms with organic growing practices. Because the food is not being shipped or driven hundreds or thousands of miles, hyper-local sourcing cuts down on vehicle emissions.
In addition to sourcing locally, Source reduces its environmental impact by minimizing ingredient waste, utilizing about 98 percent of the product they bring in. “Everything from the peels of the carrots to the ends of the garlic to the bones of the chickens is used,” Kevorkian says.
Spyce similarly cuts down on its food waste where possible. According to Farid, fast-food restaurants usually store food in hot wells to keep items warm so that they can be served immediately when a customer orders. Because health codes prohibit reheating food that has already been warmed, restaurants often end up throwing away whatever is left of their hot food at the end of the day.
With Spyce’s Infinite Kitchen model, however, all ingredients are cooked to order. “That means that whatever, say, chopped broccoli we have at the end of the day can be used tomorrow, since it never got cooked,” said Farid. “Our waste isn’t zero, but we have the opportunity to bring it pretty close to zero.”
Spyce also cuts down on waste through its packaging, which is entirely compostable except for the dressing cups. And in another effort to reduce its carbon footprint, Spyce created a menu without red meat.
Besides a commitment to the environment, the models of Source and Spyce both center around their customers and the local community.
For Source, this takes the form of philanthropy.
“In the restaurant industry, we’re all about hospitality,” Roughan says. “Being hospitable doesn’t always mean that it benefits you as a restaurant, but if you’re looking at the big picture, [hospitality] doesn’t end within the four walls of your restaurant.”
To give back to the community, Source delivers meals to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y Shelter in Cambridge. Roughan recalls driving through post-blizzard snow to provide meals for the homeless shelter, even though the storm caused his own restaurant to pause operations. “We have a commitment to provide meals for the homeless shelter,” he says. “No matter how bad it is for us, it’s a hell of a lot worse for a lot of other people.”
At Spyce, the menu centers around the customer; after indicating any allergies or dietary preferences, Spyce crafts a tailored menu that incorporates those restrictions. “It will show you a menu that’s perfect to you, and then we can execute it without risk of making any mistakes,” Farid says.
Some have criticized Spyce’s automated model for replacing jobs with robots. For example, in an opinion piece published earlier this month, Crimson Editorial writers expressed their “deep belief that slight improvements in efficiency are never worth denying opportunities for human flourishing means we’ll never find Spyce palatable.” But Theodora M. Skeadas ’12, Executive Director of Cambridge Local First, notes that the unique Cambridge economy meshes well with Spyce’s model.
“I’m not as concerned, because our reality is that small businesses actually have a hard time finding people to hire, so in the context of Cambridge, they’re not actually displacing employees,” Skeadas says. Because a significant majority of the workforce inCambridge is reliably employed by large employers like Harvard and MIT, Skeadas explains, there are more jobs available than people looking for jobs.
Farid also notes that although machines prepare the bowls, employees still oversee the machinery and hand off bags of food to customers, and the reduced operating costs allow Spyce to pay the employees it does have higher salaries — around 15 percent over market rate.
Restaurants are notoriously difficult businesses to run: The margins are narrow and the operating costs high. But the novel concepts of both restaurants, though risky, could boost their sticking power. According to Skeadas, restaurants like Pinnochio’s have remained for so long because they are tourist attractions in their own right. In this way, the niche angles of both Source and Spyce could help them establish themselves as landmarks of Harvard Square.
In addition, Source and Spyce’s concurrent arrivals could help each other, as they each play a distinct role in the community. “It’s a rising tide that lifts all boats, so,” Skeadas says. “It’s not like they’re competing. Rather, the businesses form more of a synergy. When you have a whole group of businesses, they all feed into each other.”
“There’s restaurants that you go to on Valentine’s Day or your birthday,” Farid says. “It’s about the experience and the servers and the interactions with everyone there. It’s all about the human. That’s never going to see automation — that’s about an experience.”

My salangai, red anklets with three rows of bells, chimed through our apartment as I danced Bharatanatyam, anIndian classical dance. Nearly every day for the past 16 years, I practiced rhythmic tattu mettus until my feet became calloused and our downstairs neighbors filed a complaint about the “incessant basketball thumping.”
As my dance classes intensified, we rented a garage a short walk from our apartment building. Through most of high school, I carried a fan to this makeshift studio and practiced with the door slightly ajar until the moon crept out or I began to feel bug bites on my sticky arms.
During these long nights, I learned Nee Manam Irangi Varuvai, the only varnam — a type of Carnatic musical composition — that my dance teacher taught in pure Tamil, my native tongue.
I was born in India and raised speaking only Tamil for the first five years of my life, so when I moved to the suburbs of Dallas, I was placed into the English as a Second Language program at my elementary school. I was shy — not in an endearing way, but a concerning one. One of my teachers asked my parents if I had a speech or language disorder when I still rarely spoke up at the age of seven.
In reality, I was just at a loss for English words. During show-and-tell, my classmates shot ugly glares at me when I couldn’t respond to their electronic gadgets and colorful toys. When it was my turn, I held up a battered stuffed dog my aya, maternal grandmother, had given me.
“This is Thangam,” I began. I was interrupted by classmates calling out, “What does that mean in English?” and “Can she even speak English?”, both curious and cruel. I stopped and switched languages, thinking for a moment before mumbling, “It means ‘Gold.’” My face was flushed and I didn’t know how to continue, so I returned to my seat. I didn’t have the words to defend myself.
When I said “Gold,” I felt it only in my lips; when I said “Thangam,” I felt it in my heart.
After that, I stopped dragging Thangam with me everywhere, and much to everyone’s relief, I learned English. My parents drove me to every library within a 30-mile radius of our home, and they began to walk out of parent-teacher conferences with beaming smiles instead of hushed whispers. With each blue summer reading challenge ribbon that went up on my wall, I lost a bit of my Tamil, until I even exchanged amma for “mom.”
Over the coming years, my mom and I bonded over 40-minute car rides from Irving to Plano for dance class. We would play 106.1, Kiss FM, and I was content to listen to the same five or six hit pop songs on repeat. I loved when I could decipher Ariana Grande’s fast-paced lyrics for my mom, for whom all the words blurred together. Even when I forgot to practice and was more excited by post-class shopping trips than the dancing itself, my parents still loved that I was learning a part of their culture. Our car rides remained a weekly tradition even after I got my own license.
As I walked into my dance studio, the bright sounds of 106.1 music were gradually replaced by the classical flute interlude playing through my teacher’s speakers. From the ages of 15 to 17, I learned the varnam Nee Manam Irangi Varuvai, which loosely translates to “You [Lord Muruga] Show Compassion and Come [to Me].” Growing up, my parents told me stories about Lord Muruga riding his peacock around the world, and I read comic books about his battles against asuras, or demons. However, I was stumped when it came to the abhinaya, or expressive portions of the dance, about his domestic life with two wives, Devasena and Valli.
How was I to showcase, even celebrate, the intimacy of an arranged marriage awarded to Devasena after years of penance? My peers at school opposed the idea of women giving up parts of their autonomy for a man. In my history textbooks, I read about arranged marriages as slippery slopes to forced marriages, rife with concerns about colorism and casteism in the South Asian community. After reading these articles and circling the big words in colorful Sharpies, I concluded this was a backwards practice.
I couldn’t adopt Devasena’s character when I disapproved of her actions. Each movement felt ridiculous, graceless, and exaggerated. I bounced on my feet, clearly distracted each time I adopted her demure stance. I angrily stumbled through the mudras, or hand gestures, that showcased Lord Muruga with his two consorts.
In these moments where I could not change how confused I felt, I listened to the varnam on repeat. The language that I had tried so hard to replace with English came back. I began to love how the dancer, the devotee, addresses Lord Muruga with nee, a colloquial “you” that would normally only be used among friends, instead of the more formal neengal that I use to address strangers, parents, or elders. I felt each nee sink through layers of practice saris and align perfectly with the chimes of my salangai. Nee was a sign of intimacy that I could understand.
I tried to lose myself in the Tamil words themselves, instead of ascribing my American judgement to the story. The song uses “mayangi, tedi, alainda” to describe how the devotee was “fainting, searching, and wandering” before Lord Muruga appeared before her, but the literal translation with three gerunds doesn’t do justice to the tense of Tamil verb forms and to the song’s meaning. Rather than simply seeking, in Tamil, the heroine is searching with desperation and weariness.
I’m sure linguistic scholars could analyze what is lost in translation with far more precision than I could, but just understanding that “mayangi, tedi, alainda” had no English equivalents was liberating. I stopped thinking I had to dance in a way that made sense to my peers. I started to hear and imagine a stand-alone storyline in Tamil without substituting English into every turn of the narrative.
The marriage became exciting because each time I performed, I could give Devasena the stage I wished she had. I rotated my wrists in a lasso motion and stood with my feet in a wide squat to portray Devasena’s life as a huntress; then, I allowed myself to fold inwards to depict how she covered her face with a soft veil when accompanying Lord Muruga.
Enacting the love story gave me room to negotiate with myself. I could believe in liberation for women while also cherishing traditions of familial connection through marriage. I could recognize the structural inequalities associated with arranged marriage in contemporary South Asia while appreciating the mythological story of two divine forces developing an inseparable tie over time. Why should a union governed by astrological whim be any different than one governed by human fancy or algorithmic chance?
Dancing as the devotee and as Devasena gave me a stage to subvert society’s unjust assumptions about my heritage and to simply focus on the beautiful Tamil nee each time I addressed Lord Muruga onstage. I crowded around other girls from dance class, singing along to Kiss FM’s hit singles in our dressing room before going onstage to portray wives who travel the universe for their husbands. I danced in my open garage despite curious stares from passersby.
In doing so, I learned all the things that cannot be said in English.

In 2017, the Cleveland Browns won zero of the 16 football games they played, contributing to their 90-week dry spell that started in late 2016. The following years saw minimal improvement: In 2018 and 2019, they went 7-8-1 and 6-10, respectively.
But in the 2020-21 season, their scores began to turn around: The Browns won 11 games in the season, losing only five qualifying them for the playoffs for the first time since 2002. They finished 1-1 in the playoffs, losing by only five points to the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs.
Several reasons could explain the Browns’ recent success: the acquisition of star players from trades, a string of draft picks that paid off, or new coaching staff. Ella S. Papanek ’21, however, adds another possible explanation: a player projection model she helped create that anticipates NFL players’ ‘career production,’ or a statistical measure of a player’s performance throughout their career.
One article from sports news site Sportscasting in January even speculates that the future of Baker R. Mayfield, the Browns’ quarterback, “is in the hands of Harvard senior Ella Papanek.”
Papanek’s early interest in football and NFL commentary contributed to the development of her model-based predictions, which she utilizes in her current role as a Research and Strategy Intern for the Browns.
“[NFL commentary] tended to be interspersed with a lot of hypotheticals and theories in situations where I often felt a more data-driven approach would be illuminating,” she says. “But at the time, I had pretty much zero experience working with data or even understanding of statistics.”
Once at Harvard, Papanek began taking courses that would provide her with a “toolbox” to work more deeply with NFL data. She also joined the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective, where she met other like-minded individuals and explored sports from a more quantitative perspective.
Despite being a Statistics concentrator, Papanek’s transcript also contains courses in psychology and economics. “I think [those courses] definitely give me more of a lens to think about the way that people make decisions in practice,” she says, “rather than the way that people maybe should make decisions from a theoretical perspective.”
Although the type of model Papanek worked on is relatively new, statistics and data have become increasingly popular in professional sports. “I would say, every league at this point is getting more and more invested in statistics; I know it came first with Moneyball in baseball,” Papanek explains, referencing the subject of a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt. “At this point, there’s really more data than people know what to do with.”
Papanek recognizes that the NFL has lagged behind other sports in terms of utilizing data, but is excited about the league’s progress. She mentions player tracking data as one of the NFL’s “biggest developments.” Athletes wear chips embedded in their shoulder pads, which record their location on the field. “I think that datasets of that size and that granularity have endless power to really improve the way that we view the game,” she says.
Other areas of the NFL, however, have only recently seen improvements. The NFL, like most other professional sports, is male-dominated. Despite the recent pushes to get more women involved — the 2021 Super Bowl had a record three women serving as coaches and referees — the league’s staff still consists largely of men.
Women make up nearly half of the NFL’s viewership, but of the more than 450 coaches in the NFL, only eight are women; of those eight, none are head coaches. Of the 124 NFL officials in charge of refereeing games, only five are women.
Although Papanek doesn’t necessarily feel that her gender has “presented her significant challenges,” she says she has been warned by other women in the field that she’ll likely encounter discrimination in the future. For now, however, her ample experience in male-dominated fields has acclimated her to similar settings. “In my entire life, I pretty much have never been involved in a pursuit that is not male-dominated, so it’s something I’m very used to,” she says.
Papanek is optimistic about the recent push to make the NFL a more diverse industry. “I do think from a completely practical perspective, [the NFL] is male-dominated, and I think the NFL is working to change that,” she says. “There are a lot of teams that are looking to create more opportunities for diverse members of their departments.”
For other women interested in a career in sports, Papanek says one of the most important things is to consistently publicize your work and engage in the public discourse. “I think for women specifically, it might be more difficult to get your voice heard, and so I think it’s essential to really engage and make it clear to people that you have something to contribute,” she says.
After graduation in May, Papanek isn’t sure what she’ll do next, but she knows she wants to continue to challenge herself. “What’s most important to me is that I’m engaging with interesting problems,” she says. “I think in my life, I will follow interesting problems wherever they take me, and so we’ll see if that’s at the Browns or elsewhere.”

sujatha baliga’s path to restorative justice, a non-carceral response to crime, began with what she calls a “nervous breakdown.” Fresh out of college, baliga ’93 — who prefers to have her name styled in all lowercase — spent a year living in India while waiting on acceptance to law school. She was determined to become a prosecutor, to put criminals behind bars. Her work was in part fueled by rage: As a child, she was sexually abused by her father. She never reported because of the possible repercussions the action could have on her family.
“I did not want my father locked up,” she explains. “I did not want potential immigration consequences for my family,” adding: “I did not want to be put in some other family that didn’t speak our language, eat our food. And so I, like the vast majority of survivors, didn’t contact the system.”
The abuse ended in her teenage years — when her father died of a heart attack. He never apologized to her. “I knew I was never going to get justice,” she says. “His death didn’t feel like justice.”
Backpacking through the Tibetan settlement of Dharamshala at age 24, she felt the full force of her rage. It manifested in migraines, stomach aches, and “all kinds of health problems.” At the suggestion of her housemates, she wrote to the Dalai Lama for advice. The Llama surprised her by granting her a private audience.
baliga remembers the Dalai Lama listened to her carefully, “with infinite compassion,” before asking her a pivotal question: “Do you feel you’ve been angry long enough?” No one had ever asked her that before. Surveying the “diminishing returns of anger” in her life, she responded yes. He then advised her to meditate and to “consider opening her heart to her enemies.”
The meeting was “the most important hour of [her] life.” She felt that the permission to feel angry about the abuse she suffered was “one of the greatest gifts [she] had ever received.”
“I didn’t like, instant ‘Poof!’, forgive my father,” she says. “The big eureka moment in my life was that I didn't have to be filled with hatred towards this person who I had really blamed for ruining my life.”
Months later, she accepted a spot at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and decided to instead become a defense attorney. But after clerking in the federal courts and defending people on death row, she knew she could not practice law for long.
***
In school, she learned that punishment is intended to serve four purposes: general and specific deterrence to crime, incapacitation of violent offenders, and retribution. Looking at the rates of recidivism — the rate of reoffense by convicted criminals — and crime within prisons, she had to disagree. The criminal legal system only seemed to succeed at retribution, which she felt could not heal victims of crimes — never mind their perpetrators.
Her meeting with the Dalai Lama underscored the power of speaking one’s truth and being listened to, of having one’s own needs centered. “In criminal law, the state owns the harm, not you,” she explains. “Victims are totally sidelined.”
A friend from law school had encouraged her for years to read more about restorative justice, a peacemaking practice rooted in Indigenous communities. baliga explains that it draws inspiration from Navajo peacemaking practices, as well as Maori family group conferencing practices. In the early 2000s, she began attending trainings on holding dialogues between victims and those who had harmed them — exchanges intended to “lovingly hold [people] directly accountable to crime survivors’s self-identified needs.”
In 2006, baliga left the practice of law to “dedicate [herself] full time to restorative justice.” She joined a budding California-based organization founded by activist Fania Davis, sister of famed political activist and scholar Angela Y.Davis, called Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth. With the help of a Soros Justice Fellowship, baliga helped expand the program from five people meeting in a basement to a robust restorative juvenile diversion program. Since then, she has led several national award-winning programs for youth and people affected by domestic and sexual violence, creating space for an alternate conception of justice: one based on the power of community accountability rather than punishment.
***
A restorative justice case looks something like this: A district attorney designates a specific set of crimes that will be automatically eligible for restorative justice. A community-based organization is given access to these files and reaches out directly to the person who caused harm, without laying the charge. Once the person agrees to the program, the organization will contact the crime survivor and ask them three central questions: How are you harmed? What do you need? Whose obligation is it to meet those needs?
After a few preparatory meetings, both parties and their respective support networks convene in a circle. The face-to face-dialogue — the central piece of the restorative justice practice — unfolds and the person who caused harm presents “a plan to repair the heart.” This proposal must fulfill four tenets: doing right by the person you harmed, your parents or guardians, your community, and yourself. Once the restorative justice facilitator verifies the plan was completed, the community organization reports to the DA that the process is over. The charges are never dealt with in court. Nothing else happens.
While there is no singular definition of restorative justice, baliga believes most deeply in the vision of Howard J. Zehr. Known as “the grandfather of restorative justice,” Zehr deems it a complete paradigm shift incompatible with the criminal legal system.
baliga’s dedication to restorative justice extends far beyond her professional work. The belief system influences her closest relationships and even the presentation of her name. Her preference to not capitalize her name stems from a belief in minimizing hierarchy. “I’m looking at this desk I’m sitting at right now and thinking, ‘If I don’t think of myself as more important than this desk, I am less likely to trash the desk and get a new desk, right?’” she says. “Like, I feel like humans excessively elevate ourselves in relationship to all the things we don’t capitalize.”
When she and her husband find themselves on the brink of an argument, they read their wedding vows, which hang on a wall in their South Berkeley house, before they sit down with a talking piece. “We live circle,” she says.
She recently held a circle for her son after he witnessed someone break into their home. Even though he refused to give a description of the intruder after their neighbors called the police — baliga avoids calling the police at all and teaches her son the same – she knew he still needed to work through the trauma that the event provoked. In the space of the circle, baliga’s son could work through his fraught experience without fear that suspects would be racially profiled.
***
Unfortunately, baliga finds that restorative justice can be easily co-opted as “a feel good thing,” saying that what many people call restorative justice is actually an “add on or tack on to the current punitive system.”
For instance, baliga doubts the effectiveness of implementing restorative justice programs in colleges and universities. Despite the many “wonderful things that come out of Title IX,” she believes that the civil rights law can make practicing restorative justice difficult, especially in the context of sexual violence.
“In my dream world, survivors would have an option for what they do,” baliga says. They could opt out of Title IX’s methods, some of which she considers “automatically triggering” in order to “make things right outside of those structures.”
She counters the notions that restorative justice only works in the context of non-violent crimes or with younger offenders. The true obstacles to implementing restorative justice have nothing to do with the nature of a crime. Instead, baliga points to a lack of imagination, “colonized minds,” minimal funding, blind faith in the state to address conflict, and dissociation from community. But restorative justice cannot co-exist with prisons.
baliga’s utopia is a world that foregrounds preventative care. She believes that providing accessible spaces for people to share their struggles, big or small, and receive support “before anything rises to the level of harm” will transform communities. “Almost every single harm that arises will not arise,” she says.
In the context of the criminal legal system, and the overarching assumption that wrongdoing necessitates retribution, baliga’s conviction in a paradigm-shifting ideal of justice may seem unreachable. For those with cautious imaginations and colonized minds, she expresses, non-punitive responses to harm might feel abstract, let alone unrealistic.
When baliga reflects on her own life, however, she recalls countless instances that were restorative justice in everything but name, moments when “people came together to heal a harm and listened to one another.”
“Basically, every time you’re doing that there’s a flavor of restorative justice in it,” baliga says. “But I think the roots of it are there in every campfire, every time that someone’s called you with a problem and you’ve had the wisdom to just listen without spitballing solutions.”
Maybe restorative justice — or at least its foundations — is already familiar.

For William M. Sutton ’23, the decision to join Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student organization which since 2012 has fought to dismantle rape culture at Harvard, was an easy one. He sees sexual violence as an issue so “pervasive and immediate” that standing by is simply not an option. “You can see it, or experience it, or know people who have experienced it,” he says. “You can point at it and say it happens here. And once you know that, how do you not try to stop it?”
Sutton has been involved in anti-sexual violence activism since high school and was eager to continue this work as a freshman at Harvard. He had heard of Our Harvard Can Do Better before, but it wasn’t until seeing them speak in favor of better responses to harassment and assault at the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers picket line last winter that he noticed their passion and emphasis on community organizing. He joined soon after.
Sutton had only a few short weeks of organizing in person with Our Harvard. In March, the organization’s members found themselves flung far and wide across the country as the University transitioned to remote learning.
Sutton spent the remainder of his freshman year at his family home in Hingham, Mass. It was from this house that he helped launch one of Our Harvard’s most comprehensive campaigns yet. When I speak to him over Zoom, he’s sitting at his desk, behind which I can see framed Green New Deal posters hung side-by-side on the wall. They look like merchandise from Alexandria Ocasio Cortez’s online store.
The isolation of the pandemic, Sutton admits, has made organizing difficult. But after then-Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos released new Title IX regulations in late spring, Our Harvard members spent their summers huddled over their computers collaborating on a response to this crucial moment.
These new regulations, released on May 6, include a narrowed definition of sexual misconduct, as well as a requirement for Title IX proceedings to include live hearings with cross-examinations of both parties. All universities receiving federal funding, Harvard included, were given just 70 business days to issue policies in compliance with the new rules.
Supporters of DeVos’s laws applaud them for giving more rights to the accused. Many anti-sexual violence organizations, however, fear they will dissuade survivors from reporting; given that instances of sexual assault are already notoriously underreported, this is a huge cause of concern for Sutton and other members of Our Harvard Can Do Better.
Our Harvard knew that DeVos’s brief turnaround would give Harvard until Aug. 14 to release revised policies in compliance with the new Title IX regulations. The organization spent several months after the DeVos ruling researching, discussing, and drafting a petition with 16 specific demands for Harvard’s revised policies. These demands included protective measures to make live cross-examinations less stressful for survivors, a 60-day timeframe for all Title IX investigations, and a clearer University-wide definition of consent.
The group released their petition on July 4, over a month before Harvard’s new policies would be completed, demanding that Harvard implement the “dangerous provisions” issued by the Department of Education in a manner that would minimize harm to survivors.
The petition garnered over 1,000 individual signatures, as well as the support of 74 student organizations. In addition to the written petition, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better met over Zoom with University Title IX coordinators to share their perspective on how Harvard should respond to the Department of Education’s new rules.
According to University Spokesperson Nate Herpich, the “valuable input” from Our Harvard Can Do Better and other members of the Harvard community “overwhelmingly supported the University’s decision to create two interim policies that go beyond the minimum requirements stipulated by the new Title IX regulations.” The provisional nature of these “interim” policies allowed the University to technically meet DeVos’s deadline, while also having the flexibility to finalize policies later on.
While the interim policies do go beyond the bare minimum of the DeVos administration’s requirements, they do not come close to fulfilling all of the demands made by Our Harvard Can Do Better. The student organization released a statement in August detailing their dissatisfaction with the University’s response to their suggestions. Specifically, they called for the University to adopt a model of affirmative consent and to strengthen systems of support exterior to Title IX.
Our Harvard Can Do Better’s demands do more than express concern about the Title IX changes made under DeVos — they also expose a major gap between what Our Harvard thinks students need and what the University provides in terms of support. The organization’s nine year fight to fill this gap provides a window into varied interpretations of justice. For some survivors, justice is found through formal processes, like Title IX proceedings. For others, Sutton says, justice is easier to find outside of Harvard’s institutions: “One, because they think, or know, that those institutions may fail them. And two, because they don’t necessarily want to punish the person who did them harm,” he says. “Title IX is not a carceral institution, but it can really ruin somebody’s life. And honestly, sometimes survivors don’t want the lives of that person ruined. They just don’t want it to happen again.”
Sutton says that Our Harvard Can Do Better does not favor one interpretation of justice over another. In his mind, by advocating for better Title IX policies, Our Harvard tries to create institutions which will not fail survivors; for survivors who find Title IX too punitive or formal, Our Harvard pushes for alternate resources that exist outside of those very institutions. In doing so, the organization attempts to adapt broader systems of justice to meet individual students’ needs.
Improving and diversifying Harvard’s responses to sexual assault, however, will require the cooperation of both student activists and the University, a feat which historically has been difficult — indeed, many of the changes Our Harvard advocates for today have been part of its platform from the organization’s beginning nine years ago.
As I spoke to Our Harvard members and University representatives about what Title IX actually looks like at Harvard, I found myself asking for clarification again and again. I’m not the only one puzzled by Title IX — in a recent report on sexual harassment at Harvard, an external review comittee found “widespread confusion about even the most fundamental aspects of the reporting system,” writing that, “Multiple individuals, for instance, did not know the difference between the Title IX Office and the ODR” — the Office for Dispute Resolution — “or the difference between a disclosure and a formal complaint.”
I counted myself among these individuals up until a conversation with Our Harvard Can Do Better member Remedy H. Ryan ’21. Ryan explained to me that the Title IX office is where survivors can go to report sexual misconduct and ask for supportive measures, like extensions on assignments and section switches, so that they are better supported as they continue their education. Supportive measures can be given without opening a formal investigation. If a survivor chooses to start a formal investigation, the case is passed along from the Title IX Office to the Office for Dispute Resolution. If the ODR finds a violation of policy, a final party decides on disciplinary measures. For undergraduate respondents, this final party is the Administrative Board.
When I tell Ryan it seems crazy how many people I’ve spoken to before fully understanding the intricacies of that chain of events, she laughs and tells me that “it’s really taken four years” for her to pin them down so well. “Which is kind of sad itself,” she adds. Ryan is a senior studying Social Studies and WGS. She’s been a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better since she was a freshman.
She believes that confusion about the logistical aspects of Title IX could deter reporting in and of itself, pointing out that more students might seek supportive measures if they knew they could do so without starting a formal investigation.
Another misconception of Title IX is the tendency to view it as a criminal process. In actuality, Title IX is meant to ensure that sexual misconduct and gender-based discrimation do not prevent any student from fully participating in their education. Ryan points out that, “at the end of a Title IX proceeding, no one’s going to jail. No one’s going to prison, right? It’s really about access to education, and that’s why it’s so important.”
It’s true Title IX’s purpose isn’t to charge respondents with crimes and incarcerate them. However, Title IX outcomes can have extreme effects on a perpetrator’s life. At Harvard, the most serious response to Title IX policy violations is dismissal or expulsion, which, although not carceral, is still a solution which can feel “really punitive in nature,” as Sutton puts it.
Title IX has occupied this gray area between educational access and discipline for a long time, but the changes made under DeVos evoke its parallels to the criminal justice system more than ever. Our Harvard Can Do Better worries this will turn even more survivors away, since many seek out Title IX as an alternative to going through the process of a criminal lawsuit. In particular, instituting a live questioning procedure which requires accusers to recall their experiences in great detail before a panel is worrisome to members of Our Harvard. They fear that such cross-examinations could be re-traumatizing to survivors. In the past, Harvard has investigated Title IX complaints by interviewing each of the involved parties and witnesses separately.
Ryan argues that changing this practice will only deter reporting, emphasizing that “trying to build up the Title IX process to make it very similar to a court proceeding isn’t the point.”
Sutton agrees, saying the new regulations “have more of a chilling effect on reporting, rather than an actual securing of the rights of the accused.” He argues that “it’s very difficult to go through a Title IX process in terms of your mental well-being, but also in terms of success.” As of 2019, only 47 percent of Harvard’s Title IX complaints that proceeded to ODR investigations resulted in the finding of a policy violation.
In Sutton’s view, this is a relatively low percentage of findings, and demonstrates that respondents were likely not denied due process in Title IX proceedings prior to the new DeVos rulings. In short, he doesn’t think the provisions are “responding to a real need.”
Our Harvard hoped the inclusion of its demands would make Title IX a more accessible, welcoming resource to survivors who feel it could bring them justice. Some of these demands were successfully included in Harvard’s interim policies. For example, Harvard has agreed to implement measures to make live hearings and cross examinations more comfortable for survivors. It has also created separate procedures to investigate University policy violations no longer covered by Title IX’s new, narrower definition of misconduct.
These measures address concerns about changes made under DeVos, but they don’t make Title IX as supportive to survivors as Our Harvard believes it could be. One of the largest disappointments to student organizers was Harvard’s decision not to adopt a definition of affirmative consent.
An affirmative consent policy would “flip the burden of proof onto respondents to show that they obtained consent,” Our Harvard writes in the petition. This policy would require students to receive positive verbal consent, rather than relying on the absence of a “No.” Instead, the University has maintained its “unwelcome conduct” policy, which, according to Our Harvard’s petition, “assumes that all sexual conduct is welcome — that all parties have consented — unless survivors prove otherwise.”
Sutton sees the unwelcome conduct policy as another way in which Title IX proceedings are made similar to criminal ones. In criminal trials, the assumption is that power works against the accused, hence the “innocent until proven guilty” doctrine which defines our criminal justice system.
However, when it comes to sexual harassment and assault, the power imbalance is often reversed against survivors. This reversal, Our Harvard suggests, means the burden of proof should be reversed as well. Title IX cases are also not like criminal trials in that they seek to prove that a plaintiff’s access to education was impeded, not that a respondent broke a law.
Sutton says opposers of affirmative consent view it as too “stringent,” meaning it asks too much of the accused to require proof that they obtained consent. He pushes back against this mindset, saying, “This is Title IX. It’s sort of its own thing. So when we’re talking about consent definitions, if it’s more stringent than maybe you’d like as a trial lawyer, it doesn’t really matter.”
While Our Harvard believes the benefits of an affirmative consent standard are obvious, the issue is deeply controversial — so controversial, in fact, that the University and student activists have clashed over it for nearly a decade.
During her time as an undergraduate, Kate J. Sim ’14 saw the need for a dialogue about sexual violence at Harvard as obvious, inescapable even. “It was kind of impossible to not talk about sexual violence with friends,” she says. “It was just a common thread that structured [the experiences of] a lot of my peers, in my experience.”
In 2012, Sim co-founded Our Harvard Can Do Better alongside classmate Pearl Bhatnagar ’14 in the hopes of creating public change out of these private conversations. She looks back on her time with the organization with incredible “pride and tenderness.” Sim is currently a doctoral candidate at the Oxford Internet Institute, studying sexual misconduct reporting technologies in U.S. higher education. Kept busy by her research, Sim says she doesn’t follow Our Harvard’s projects as closely these days, but that “it’s been a real pleasure to see it grow and change over the years.”
And while Sim finds Our Harvard Can Do Better’s longevity as an organization inspiring, she also remarks that its continued existence is a sign of the persistent need for on-campus anti-violence activism. The organization’s earliest projects bear a striking resemblance to those it focuses on today.
Our Harvard’s original short-term intent centered around two main goals. The first was to get a University-wide affirmative consent standard. The second was to make “Title IX procedures and resources more robustly available,” Sim says, adding that she had heard “countless horror stories” of students who were unable to receive necessary supportive measures after an instance of sexual misconduct.
In 2014, when Sim was a senior, Our Harvard Can Do Better filed a federal Title IX complaint criticizing Harvard’s responses to sexual assault. Jess R. Fournier ’17, who began organizing with Our Harvard as a freshman after meeting Sim at the Activities Fair, helped write the complaint. They describe the experience of filing the complaint in vivid, rambling detail, pausing only to recall a specific name or date, or to ask me if they’re talking too fast.
Fournier describes the complaint as a compilation of anonymous stories of sexual violence gathered from Harvard students over the course of six months. It also included an in-depth analysis of Harvard’s policies and their failings, as well as a list of demands, among which were “a change to [an] affirmative consent standard, robust and comprehensive sexual education, [and] a more inclusive set of remedies,” according to Sim.
Sim says Our Harvard’s complaint won over the support of many students and faculty members. Soon after Our Harvard filed their complaint, former University President Drew G. Faust created a task force to look at Harvard’s policies regarding sexual violence, and formed the more centralized Title IX office that students are familiar with today.
However, Harvard resisted complying with student calls for an affirmative consent standard, just as they have continued to do for years since. Sim believes this resistance is rooted in the University’s fear that, “If we change the consent standard, then we’re suddenly going to have more assaults.” That, she says, is “sort of the point.” She’s implying not that a policy change would somehow cause more literal instances of misconduct, but that a more inclusive definition of assault would increase the number of students who’d be willing and able to bring their cases to Title IX.
Fournier recalls multiple meetings with representatives of the Title IX office to discuss an affirmative consent policy during their time with Our Harvard. They say the general sentiment expressed by the University in these meetings was that affirmative consent was too broad of a concept for students to use and understand, despite 85 percent of the student body endorsing the policy change in a 2012 UC referendum.
Fournier suspects that the University’s resistance to adopting an affirmative consent standard — and their attitude toward sexual violence policy in general — is “all about limiting their own responsibility and liability.”
“They’ll sit down and they’ll nitpick you over the words in that policy, but at the end of the day, that’s what it’s about,” they say. The University declined to comment on this claim. Fournier has become “more and more skeptical about the efficacy of filing Title IX complaints against universities” over time because of what they view as Harvard’s self-protective conservatism. “A lot of the conversations being had,” they note, “are very similar to ones that we were having when I was a student.”
This repetition, Fournier speculates, may be intentional on the University’s part. They suggest that the cyclical nature of student activism, “that people graduate and move on and things get forgotten,” may allow Harvard to be more resistant to change. One of the strengths that has allowed Our Harvard Can Do Better to persist for nine years is its ability “to give people this history that the university purposefully conceals” — a history of what they see as inadequate responses to sexual violence.
Fournier is not alone in what they refer to as their “institutional skepticism.” Current members of Our Harvard also express disillusionment with the University’s responses to their initiatives.
Priya P. Kukreja ’21 is one such skeptical student. Kukreja is from Omaha, Neb. She says her high school was ultra-conservative, and as one of a few progressive students she gained a “very intimate understanding of what power looks like and what oppression looks like.” When she came to Harvard, she expected this understanding to be common knowledge. “I realized quickly that I don't go to a hyper-leftist, liberal University, as much as people like to call elite universities that,” she says. She was relieved to find a community of like-minded individuals in Our Harvard Can Do Better, which she joined her freshman year.
Kukreja is currently living in Leverett House, and the first time I speak to her over Zoom, she flips her laptop around so I can see the view from her window — the rooftops of Cambridge are tiny and snow-capped down below. She’s cheerful and impassioned when she talks about the advocacy work she’s done with Our Harvard, but when we discuss levying for change at the University level, the frustration in her voice is audible.
She says that conversations she’s had with University representatives, like discussions of interim Title IX measures over the summer, “have not felt productive, or mutually respectful.” Kukreja fears that while individual University members are sympathetic to Our Harvard’s cause, in the end “a money-driven, profit-driven, image-driven institution like Harvard” will not put student interests first. “Especially students that could be a liability,” she adds, “which are survivors of sexual violence.” Harvard declined to comment on this assertion.
Because of Harvard’s response, or lack thereof, to student demands, Kukreja tells me most survivors have no real resources “other than reporting or staying silent, both of which are not ideal at all.”
With nowhere else to turn, these students may seek justice via other avenues. Such was the case over the summer. Around the same time Our Harvard was advocating for change at the level of institutional Title IX policy, another, less formal movement against sexual violence at Harvard was coming to its boiling point. In June, several Twitter accounts began to post anonymous stories of harassment and assault at Harvard. Within the span of a few days, the number of followers and posts rose rapidly.
The sheer magnitude of submissions made clear just how widespread an issue sexual misconduct is at Harvard. Most of the stories shared included the full name and class year of the alleged perpetrator. I found myself assigning names and faces to stories which ranged from uncomfortable to outwardly violent. These were no longer strangers. These were classmates, acquaintances, people I used to smile and wave at in the dining hall. For many students, the names and faces were those of friends.
Within the few days that the accounts were active, they captivated the attention of Harvard’s student body. The experience of watching the allegations pour forward was nerve-wracking and electrifying at once. I had the sense the entire school was watching, reloading their Twitter feeds again and again.
Anna, a Harvard undergrad who spoke under a pseudonym to protect her privacy, says that when she came across the Twitter accounts her primary feeling was one of relief. “I immediately recognized it as an avenue by which I could express something that had been weighing on me for a long time,” she says. Still, the decision to share her story publicly was not an easy one, even if her name would not be attached. “I was refreshing the page all day,” she says. In the end, her friends encouraged her to share her experience.
The story Anna chose to share occurred during her freshman year at Harvard. A male student she had met once before at a party texted her one Friday night, asking her to come to his room under false pretenses; he claimed he was coming out as bisexual and needed emotional support. When Anna, slightly drunk after attending a party, arrived at the student’s room, he told her the text had been a lie. He was not coming out; he just needed to get a girl to his room as part of a hazing ritual for his sports team.
Anna says she was embarrassed and confused. When the student asked her to stay, claiming his team was watching, she agreed. He gave Anna more alcohol, then tried to kiss her. She said “No” twice, but he ignored her and continued.
“It didn’t seem like anything I could pursue through any formal avenue, nor that I wanted to pursue through any formal avenue,” Anna says. At times, she’d doubt the seriousness of her experience, despite the fact that she associated “such strong humiliation and coercion with it.” When she found the Twitter accounts, they “seemed like the perfect place, because it was for identifying moments like this, that might not fall into any traditional buckets, but that are kind of harmful nonetheless.”
Kukreja says she and the other members of Our Harvard were sympathetic to the intent of these anonymous accounts. “It was a tough conversation for Our Harvard Can Do Better to have about whether we should advise people to take down these stories, or to encourage them to keep them up,” she says. “Because at some point, it is a form of accountability to name names.”
This was a sentiment shared by Anna, who says she knew of other girls who’d had bad experiences with her perpetrator. Naming him felt, to her, like a “public good” that might prevent his misconduct from recurring.
Kukreja says Our Harvard ultimately decided the Twitter accounts were doing “more harm than good” when the group realized the accounts were putting survivors at risk of more harassment or targeting. It was possible for perpetrators to publicly expose the identities of their anonymous accusers, or for them to muddy the waters of the unvetted accounts by submitting false allegations.
Our Harvard released a statement outlining the risks the Twitter accounts posed to survivors, suggesting alternative “opportunities for community accountability and sexual respect.” In response, both Twitter accounts deleted all allegations and ceased to post, pointing survivors in the direction of Our Harvard and other resources.
Anna says in the end, the surge of social media activism “didn’t even make as much of a difference as people thought.” After her story was posted, her perpetrator reached out to her directly. She says at first he was respectful and apologetic, but the conversation quickly devolved into him making excuses, victimizing himself, and refusing to acknowledge how his actions were wrong. “It did more harm than good for me personally,” she says, “and probably for him, like it just made him feel more righteous and wronged by women.”
In particular, Anna was outraged when her perpetrator claimed he had a “policy” of asking for consent up to three times before abandoning a sexual pursuit. While she doesn’t blame her experience on the failure of any particular office at Harvard, she does see this as “a failure of Harvard education.” “Badgering someone until they acquiesce,” she reasons, is “obviously not what consent is,” because it disregards and disrespects how the individual feels about the encounter. She says she thinks Harvard should have “more continuing discussions” about what consensual sex looks like, rather than a few “ineffective” plays freshman year.
Despite her own negative experience, Anna hopes that the Twitter accounts at least caused people to reflect on their potentially harmful actions and commit to change. “I like to think that every guy who’s done something bad was shaking in his boots,” she says, “and had a moment thinking, ‘Okay, I’m never going to do this again.’”
Ryan says the summer’s onslaught of Twitter allegations “sparked a conversation that needed to be had, for sure.” In her view, the changes Our Harvard suggested in their petition could mitigate many of the issues illuminated by the accounts.
She believes that an affirmative consent standard, as opposed to the unwelcome conduct standard, “would give students a little bit more of a clear guideline” as to what consent looks like and what circumstances negate consent, so that harmful situations like those highlighted by the Twitter accounts could be avoided.
Anna, on the other hand, says her experience makes her unsure whether Harvard students would properly use affirmative consent. She worries that defining consent solely on the presence of a “Yes” could still be “weaponized” against survivors, because saying “Yes” once doesn’t imply consent for the duration of a sexual encounter. She also believes there can be respectful encounters where affirmation is not verbal, and views consent as a holistic consideration of verbal, nonverbal, and situational cues.
Regardless, there is a general consensus among members of Our Harvard that the Twitter accounts were attempting to create a healing space for survivors who don’t feel their vision of justice aligns with the spirit of Title IX, or of any other formal resource, for that matter. While outing a perpetrator online may provide temporary relief, Anna says it’s difficult to create long-lasting, productive change without an outside party facilitating the conversation.
One of Our Harvard Can Do Better’s most recent projects may fulfill this lack of mediation. The group has begun to look toward restorative justice and abolitionist feminism as guiding principles for creating resources that fit the needs of survivors who, for whatever reason, don’t see Title IX as a viable option.
Restorative justice is an alternative form of healing external to the criminal justice system. It focuses on repairing harm through community accountability and mediated conversations between offenders and those they’ve affected. Although Title IX is also an alternative to the criminal justice system, the formality and potential disciplinary consequences of a Title IX proceeding can make it feel more similar to a trial.
The goal of restorative justice, meanwhile, is not to prove harm occurred, then dole out punishment. Instead, its aim is to allow both individuals involved in an instance of misconduct, and the community as a whole, to reach a place of mutual healing. Our Harvard thinks it could change the future of sexual assault response at Harvard.
How exactly to implement restorative justice practices is not yet clear. Kukreja says that ideally, Harvard’s restorative justice model would allow students to engage in “voluntary, safe conversation about sexual interactions that were not consensual, to reach a mutual place where both parties feel heard.”
Our Harvard hopes to pursue restorative justice through “community-based avenues that do not rely on the institution of Harvard,” Kukreja says. This, she admits, is easier said than done. For one, if conversations between survivors and perpetrators are mediated by individuals who aren’t “experienced in restorative justice, these conversations can go super poorly.”
Another obstacle is Harvard’s restrictions on how clubs and student organizations are allowed to respond to reports of sexual harassment or assault. These restrictions essentially dictate that “if someone reports to [Harvard personnel involved with] a club or an organization, they have to funnel it back to Title IX,” Kukreja says. “There’s no autonomy there.”
“How do you create a community that feels restorative in its approach when it has to abide by these strict guidelines put by the institution?” Kukreja asks. It’s a question Our Harvard is struggling with even now. Ryan says perhaps it would be useful for “Harvard to hire someone that can create an R.J. program that could be used for all kinds of harm.” While this option would be more centralized and institution-dependent than the community-based vision Kukreja speaks of, she admits there are other schools that have implemented successful restorative practices. Harvard’s neighbor Lesley University, for example, uses a restorative approach to address instances of “bias.”
Still, Ryan emphasizes that “Our Harvard supports survivors in whatever choices they decide to make,” whether that’s seeking justice from the police, from Title IX, or from community resources. Even regarding the anonymous Twitter accounts, Our Harvard Can Do Better does not judge any individual survivor’s decision to share their story publicly. The organization’s criticism of the accounts is not so different from its criticism of Title IX policies; in both instances, Our Harvard advocates for resources which are more supportive and safe for the students who use them, Ryan says.
The members of Our Harvard Can Do Better recognize that individual visions of justice may never align perfectly within a more general system of justice. Nonetheless, they push for changes which will make all survivors feel as supported and heard as possible, regardless of their varying needs. When I ask Ryan whether she thinks grassroots organizing or activism through existing institutions is more effective, she simply says, “It has to be both.”
“Harvard is a frustrating place,” she says. “We have to push them on every little thing. But I believe that the students at Harvard deserve better, right? [They] deserve systems that are actually going to serve them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Second-year Harvard Law School student Logan E. Brown recently launched professional pantsuit company Spencer Jane after cross-enrolling in courses at the Harvard Business School and working with the Harvard Innovation Labs.
Spencer Jane — whose site went live this January — sells a signature Ultimate Work-From-Home Blazer, as well as sweatpants and masks.
“We reinvented the blazer with the modern woman in mind,” the website reads, touting their flagship product’s versatility, practicality, and sustainability.
Brown said she was inspired to create the company when she was a first-year student at the Law School and experienced the difficulty of finding comfortable professional clothing for interviews.
“I wanted something that would last me well into the beginning of my legal career and also made me feel good,” she said. “I was going to all sorts of malls all over Boston.”
When she texted her friends to ask where they all tended to purchase their professional attire, Brown said she identified a dearth of clothing options for women in their position.
“That’s when I realized that this was a common frustration,” Brown said. “There are plenty of places that sell pantsuits, but none that really made what I was looking for. And so that was the original idea — or where the original frustration for Spencer Jane came from.”
Brown said she initially circulated a survey asking respondents where they purchased their pantsuits — and how much time they spend searching for suitable attire — with the intention of writing a paper on the topic for a Business School course, Field X.
“As I was getting all of this information and talking to more and more people, I decided that I was going to actually just fix the problem,” she said. “That’s whenever I had the idea to create Spencer Jane, and create a pantsuit based off of all of the survey data that I had collected.”
Matthew F. Sutton, a teaching assistant for Field X, the Harvard Business School course Brown took to develop her personal brand, said that the class is popular among students enrolled in other Harvard schools.
“There’s an increasing number of cross registrants that come over,” he said. “We work with them to try to help them ideate, and then form a business idea that they can build upon.”
“The students develop great ideas, and we’re just there to help any way we can. Sometimes that’s with suggestions, sometimes it’s with introductions,” Field X instructor and Business School Professor Randolph B. Cohen ’87 said. “There’s about 60 teams in the class that are building businesses, so they’re really the key motivators and the idea generators.”
“All businesses in this pandemic environment — [especially] startup businesses — face enormous challenges, and Logan’s is certainly no exception,” Cohen said. “She wants to sell workwear in a time when a lot of people aren’t going into the office, and she came up with a very clever solution to that challenge, which I really admire.”
Cohen touted Brown’s innovative entrepreneurial spirit — particularly her decision to launch Spencer Jane’s Quarantine Collection.
“It’s a real credit to her how far she’s come while taking a full course load at Harvard Law School,” he said.
Brown has amassed more than 67,000 likes on TikTok as of Wednesday and uses the platform to promote her clothing brand. A fan of the canonical 2001 film Legally Blond, she has also publicly offered to make a pink version of the pantsuit for Reese Witherspoon, whose character makes a splash at Harvard Law School.
One customer has even purchased the blazer to wear at her wedding, something Brown says is “the most exciting thing” that has probably ever happened to her.
Marisa M. Peebles, who attended Vanderbilt University with Brown, said that she and their other friends from college are “never surprised” by all of the “crazy brilliant” endeavors that Brown takes on.
Peebles said that she believes Spencer Jane is very “up with the times,” and embodies a “new mold” that synthesizes professionalism with comfort — particularly in the pandemic, when most people are working from home.
“With Logan’s brilliance, she’ll be able to lead the company in a way that will continue to stay up on the trends, regardless of whatever 2021 throws at us,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the coronavirus crisis delayed the opening of Harvard’s new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston, faculty and staff at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have begun transitioning their offices to the new building.
Harvard had intended to open the complex, which has been under construction for roughly five years, this past summer. The coronavirus pandemic, which caused the City of Boston to impose a moratorium on construction projects in the spring of 2020 and has disrupted the University’s operations more broadly, forced Harvard to delay the opening of its new campus, into which Harvard poured roughly $1 billion.
Affiliates began moving into the new engineering complex – which SEAS students were able to glimpse via a virtual tour at sophomore convocation earlier this month – on Nov. 2 of this past year, though many continue to work remotely due to the pandemic.
In its first phase of opening the complex, the school intended to ship all relevant belongings and equipment to Allston by Feb. 5, per SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff.
SEAS faculty coordinator Allison O. Choat, whose office was originally in Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory, said she and other SEAS administrators began packing up their old offices in November.
“It’s my understanding that our stuff is there,” Choat said, adding that she hopes for a “soft start” to in-person work in the summer. “The vast majority of admin staff are working remotely.”
Some professors with large research operations have begun in-person activities at the SEC. Applied Physics professor David A. Weitz said his new lab at SEC is “operational” and described the new space as “jaw-dropping.”
Not all offices have fully transitioned to the new complex, though.
Materials professor David R. Clarke, whose lab was scheduled to move to the new complex by the end of January, wrote in an email that he has yet to complete his move.
“The move was quite complicated and required specialists to disconnect and re-connect some delicate pieces of equipment,” Clarke said. “It’s not quite as straightforward as moving between apartments!”
Other faculty and staff said professional movers delivered their belongings to the new complex, but they have not seen it in person because they are working from home.
SEAS Director for Education and Research Julia C. Lee wrote in an email that she labeled her boxes in Pierce Hall so that they could be moved to Allston. The last time she was in the SEC, she wrote it was “under construction pre-quarantine.”
“Beyond that I have no idea what my office looks like nor where it is beyond what I have been shown on a blueprint,” Lee wrote.
Lab administrator Jane Salant wrote in an email she packed up her Cambridge office for “one brief 2-hour period” in October. Her belongings have since been delivered across the Charles River to the new building.
Though Salant has not stepped foot in her new office, she wrote that SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III recently gave staff a virtual tour of the new complex.
Though the complex may hold the trappings of an engineering and applied science school, Applied Computer Science professor Petros Koumoutsakos said the building will not come to life until students, faculty, and staff enter its doors.
“Buildings become buildings when there’s people inside them,” he said.
Karoff wrote SEAS will open the complex to its affiliates in adherence to campus protocols, which are determined by public health guidance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 19, 2021 at 9:40 p.m.
The Harvard Graduate Council reviewed survey data about the graduate student experience in the pandemic era, and also signed letters to the Biden administration co-written by the MIT Graduate Student Council during its second public meeting of the semester Wednesday.
Graduate School of Design students provided an introduction to the virtual gathering, continuing the in-person tradition of having one graduate school “host” each meeting. Mena W. Ahmed, the president of the GSD Student Forum, took Zoom attendees on a virtual “tour” of the school and highlighted its key traditions.
HGC President Chanthia C. Ma then presented the results of a student experience survey conducted across all the graduate schools this summer. Though Council representatives shared parts of the survey results with department administrators earlier in the year, Wednesday’s meeting was the first time the Council has shared the full findings publicly, Ma said.
The survey — which opened in May and closed in September — garnered roughly 2,000 responses, averaging a 10 percent response rate per graduate school, according to Ma.
Ma said student responses highlighted the importance of bolstering financial aid and a sense of community amid the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“One of the questions that Harvard Housing was very interested in asking was, ‘In order to be a successful student in a virtual setting, what’s essential?’ And it seemed like the top [response] was financial support, physical space, and a sense of community,” she said.
Over 1,100 respondents indicated their academic “engagement” had decreased following the transition to online learning, though nearly 800 reported their “flexibility” had increased. Roughly 700 respondents indicated their “chances for academic success” had either decreased or remained constant, with under 100 indicating chances had increased. Notably, 40 percent of respondents indicated their family and home duties had increased by five to 10 hours per week following the onset of Covid-19.
Chair of Advocacy Abhinaya Narayanan then presented seven letters penned by the MIT Graduate Student Council addressed to members of the Biden administration. The MIT Council is currently circulating the letters to graduate student governments across the nation.
Narayanan said the letters provided the Council an opportunity to advocate for issues that graduate students are currently confronting.
“This is an opportunity for us to contribute to the conversation,” she said. “Each of these schools represents 10 to 20,000 graduate students, so collectively — with the multiple graduate student governments that will be signing onto these letters — it’s a significant portion of the graduate student community speaking out on issues of importance to them.”
The letters — addressed to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the White House Office of Science and Technology, and the U.S. Department of Education, among others — speak to a myriad of concerns, including limited work visas for international students and a dearth of STEM-related funding for historically Black colleges and universities, as well as rural universities. The letters also called attention to the rollback of several Title IX provisions during the Trump administration.
HGC representatives chose to vote separately on the letter issued to the Department of Defense, which called for increased access to work visas and additional funding for students involved in “defense critical areas,” among other recommendations. While the Council did approve the motion to put its support behind the other six letters, it delayed the motion to sign the DOD letter and will hold an emergency electronic vote over the weekend.
CORRECTION: February 19, 2021
A previous version of this article stated that the Harvard Graduate Council rejected a motion to sign a letter to the Department of Defense. In fact, the Council delayed the vote on the motion and will hold an emergency electronic vote over the weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department will reduce its inventory of long guns and less-than-lethal weapons and will retire officers’ camouflage uniforms, the department announced Tuesday.
The department’s move — first reported by the Cambridge Chronicle — by comes after a turbulent summer for law enforcement and calls by Cambridge residents to demilitarize the city’s police force. Last July, CPD publicized its inventory of department equipment, which includes an armored Lenco BearCat vehicle, sniper rifles, 64 M4 assault rifles, and tear gas, which has since been destroyed. At the time, several City Councilors said they were concerned by the weapons in CPD’s inventory.
CPD’s inventory also contradicted a previous statement by Cambridge police commissioner Branville G. Bard, Jr., who had claimed in June CPD possessed “no” military equipment. Bard later said that he meant the department “did not possess materials that are only restricted to the military by law.”
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email that the department has identified 20 percent of its long weapons — including shotguns and sniper rifles — to eliminate from its arsenal. He added that CPD also plans to reduce its non-lethal weapons inventory by 30 percent.
Cambridge resident and activist Loren Crowe, who is also an Army veteran, said he encouraged Bard in conversations to commit to reducing CPD’s military weaponry.
Crowe said in an interview that he believes CPD’s decision to retire camouflage uniforms and the identified weapons marks a step toward demilitarizing police.
“It kind of boils down to the concept of ‘dress for the job you want,’” Crowe said. “If you start dressing your police like the military and arming them like the military, they’re going to start to act like the military.”
Beyond Tuesday’s announcement, CPD has not set forth a timeline for retiring the identified weapons. Bard told the Cambridge Chronicle that Massachusetts statute requires police forces to auction off unwanted weapons, but he worries that process could result in putting weapons into the wrong hands.
Warnick wrote in his email the department is working with city officials to examine alternatives.
“The date is TBD as we are currently working with the City Solicitor to determine if it is possible to destroy the retired weapons versus have them auctioned off and potentially end up in the wrong hands,” Warnick wrote.
Crowe said he felt “preliminarily happy” with Bard’s decision, though he added CPD must take further steps to improve its relations with Cambridge residents.
“There’s a lot of work to do from here, but I think it’s a strong signal that the community has a partner in our police commissioner,” Crowe said.
Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said in an interview he is not satisfied by CPD retiring some of its military equipment. He cited activists’ demands to disarm CPD entirely.
Zondervan said he is open to the idea of a limited number of officers carrying handguns in some situations. In no situation, however, should CPD officers have access to military equipment, Zondervan said, such as the department’s armored BearCat vehicle.
Warnick told Cambridge Day in 2015 that CPD had received the armored personnel carrier free of charge from the Department of Homeland Security.
“It’s just not necessary, in my opinion, for public safety,” Zondervan said. “We interpret this as a form of intimidation.”
Crowe also said he believes CPD’s possession of military equipment can alienate Cambridge residents. He referenced his deployment in Afghanistan as a U.S. Army officer.
“I’ve seen it when people roll around in Afghanistan in giant armored vehicles, and they’re rolling straight past the communities that they’re supposed to be interacting with, eventually that community is going to give up on those people,” he said. “It’s the same when there’s an armored vehicle rolling around in Cambridge.”
Warnick wrote CPD does not currently have plans to retire the BearCat vehicle, but that Bard is exploring alternatives that “would provide similar capabilities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of Asian American groups at the College said they have reacted to the spike in anti-Asian violence and racism since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic with frustration and sadness, but not surprise.
Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic — which is said to have originated in Wuhan, China — anti-Asian hate crimes and racism have skyrocketed. A New York City Police Department report that was widely circulated on social media reported that anti-Asian hate crimes had spiked 1,900 percent in 2020.
Stop AAPI Hate, a new organization formed in March, said it received over 2,800 reports of discrimination and racism against Asian-Americans between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020.
The Harvard Vietnamese Association published a statement on Instagram last week citing the above reports to condemn the recent violence, but also noted that the United States had historically always tried to “erase” Asian Americans.
Ryan D. Nguyen ’25, who helped draft the statement with HVA, said he had been following the reports of “thousands upon thousands” of anti-Asian hate crimes since the onset of the pandemic and had been inspired to act.
“I shouldn't have to worry that my grandfather will be set on fire while putting out the trash. I shouldn’t have to worry that my grandmother will be slammed to the ground and killed on her morning walk,” he said. “But here I am worrying.”
Linda K. Lin ’24, education and political chair of the Asian American Association, said the racism she has experienced throughout the pandemic has made her feel “othered” and “excluded.”
“I come from a province near Wuhan and people were like, ‘Oh, don’t talk to Linda,’” Lin said. “I think the main issue of racism is within the Asian community that I have experienced is a lot about microaggressions.”
For Lin, the pandemic has reinforced her belief that a “misconception about Asian Americans as a model minority” has fed into anti-Asian racism.
“This demographic is so diverse,” she said. “If you look at the different ethnic groups like the Burmese, and other Asian American ethnic groups, and minorities, they’re not doing so well and they don’t get attention.”
Kathy Ling ’22, co-president of the Chinese Students Association, also said that though the hate crimes were “not surprising,” it was still challenging to see this “widespread tragedy.”
For fellow CSA co-president Matthew Ho ’22, the recent spike in anti-Asian crime “feels a lot more personal” because he worries his own family members could be affected.
Emily A. Meng ’23, a member of CSA’s Senior Council, said an anti-Asian hate crime became directly impactful for them and their family when it occurred in their hometown of Wellesley, Mass.
“A white woman spit in the face of a Chinese woman who lived in Wellesley and really kind of drew the attention of the Chinese community in my town,” they said.
Isabelle L. Guillaume ’24, a Crimson Business associate and diversity co-chair for the AAA, said now is a time for Harvard students to “lend an ear” to their Asian American friends and classmates.
“We are going through things that a lot of people don’t necessarily pay attention to,” Guillaume said. “It has come to light recently, but the thing is, being anti-racist should not be a trend.”
Tram Nguyen ’22, a Harvard Vietnamese Association adviser who also helped write the organization’s statement, called on students to not only donate, but also raise awareness around the issue through social media and conversations with family members and those outside the Asian American community.
Ryan Nguyen said though he is “disheartened” by the uptick in anti-Asian American sentiment across the country, he remains “hopeful” about the progress of the country.
“My parents love America. I love this country, too. I just really wish it would love us back. And I wish that it would hear us. So there’s a lot of change to be made,” he said. “But I’m hopeful that within 20 years or 30 years, we’ll definitely see progress.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Nina C. de W. Ingrao taught Spanish, she stood in a Boylston Hall classroom “almost like the director of a symphony with this absolute grace, moving her hands in very precise motions to orchestrate grammatical exercises in the classroom,” according to Romance Languages and Literature professor Luis M. Girón-Negrón ’88.
Girón-Negrón described moments like this — Ingrao “day in and day out in the classroom, doing what she did best without force, without drama” — as his strongest memories of Ingrao, a longtime colleague and friend. When “everything else was so turbulent,” Ingrao possessed a consistent commitment to her students.
Ingrao, who served Harvard for 40 consecutive years between her roles as a Spanish Language preceptor at the College and the Extension School, died at 87 on Feb. 3.
Ingrao was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2015, according to her son, Walter M. Ingrao. Determined to fight off the disease, she started a series of aggressive treatments. Ingrao’s cause of death was due to complications from the cancer.
Born in Buenos Aires in 1933, Nina Ingrao grew up in Argentina and completed university in Argentina before receiving her teaching license in 1955.
In 1957, she moved with her husband, Hector C. Ingrao, and first son, Carl H. Ingrao, to New York. Ingrao’s husband later began working at the Harvard Observatory. This naturally led Ingrao to Harvard.
Ingrao taught at Harvard from 1972 to 2013. During her 35 year tenure in the Romance Languages and Literatures Department, Ingrao taught many of the College’s most popular courses in the Spanish language. She also taught additional night classes at the Extension School for 25 years. With her lengthy dedication to teaching, Ingrao was granted two service recognition chairs from the University, according to her sons.
In addition to teaching, Ingrao served on the Governing Committee of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.
Though some teach language at Harvard as a foundation for other work, Ingrao’s was “completely devoted to language instruction” from the start, Girón-Negrón said.
This “clarity of purpose” enabled Ingrao to develop her own pedagogy and practices. With her “instinctive gift for the exposition of Spanish grammar,” Girón-Negrón said she “graciously” and with “great devotion” taught the fundamentals of Spanish to thousands of students.
“She had a sense of method in her approach,” Girón-Negrón said. She first went over principles of Spanish grammar — complete with “a range of hand gestures she used to try to facilitate explanations of grammatical patterns” — and then helped students use those skills actively in conversation, reading, and writing.
Coupled with her precision in teaching, Ingrao’s humanity and kindness was what kept her students connected to her for years, several of her students said.
Ricardo Echávarri, who served as a teaching assistant under Ingrao’s direction as a visiting student from Mexico, wrote in a remembrance that though “the intention was that I spend a year at Harvard,” that quickly became six years “thanks to the kindness and support of Mrs. Ingrao.”
Ingrao maintained the same consistency with her elegant fashion sense, appearing “more like a movie star than a scruffy professor of Humanities,” Echávarri added. Ingrao was featured in The Crimson’s magazine for her sense of style.
Walter Ingrao, Ingrao’s younger son, said his mother “felt that it was a distinction to teach at Harvard, and it was appropriate for her to carry herself with that distinction.”
He added that while his mother was soft spoken on the outside, she was “a strong woman and promoted women to succeed.”
“Her career was her own,” he added. “She got into Harvard on her own. She got into Extension on her own. She developed the courses on her own.”
Gabriela Carrión, a Harvard Ph.D. student who worked as a teaching assistant in some of Ingrao’s Spanish courses, said that Ingrao was “elegant in dress,” but her “regal” kindness was what made her so respected.
“That for me is a real lesson — that you maintain high standards with kindness,” Carrión added. “It’s not just what you’re doing in the classroom; it’s how you behave and what you do outside of the classroom that is so critical.”
Ingrao’s kindness and consistency impacted people well past her tenure at Harvard, Carrión said.
For the 20 years after Carrión finished graduate school, Carrión said she does not remember “a single Christmas where we didn't exchange some kind of a note.”
In the age of digital connection, Carrión said Ingrao’s letters, written in perfect Spanish with “beautiful script,” were special. To Carrión, Ingrao “represented some of those old-school values in a good way.”
Even after her retirement, Ingrao maintained her commitment to teaching by hosting tea social gatherings at her house as a casual opportunity for students to practice Spanish, her sons said.
Carl Ingrao said that while his mother loved teaching, the main reason she stayed dedicated to Harvard for so many years was “all about the students.”
Girón-Negrón said the “fundamental kindness” Ingrao possessed enabled her to shape an environment, like Harvard’s, where people constantly try for “originality” and “great” achievements.
“Her sense of achievement was doing well what she did well, teaching her students, and serving them, and that she did to the very end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The grandson of a Korean independence activist withdrew his offer to donate family historical archives to Harvard’s Schlesinger Library in anger over the University’s failure to respond to a professor’s controversial paper on the issue of “comfort women.”
Philip “Flip” Ahn Cuddy — grandson of Korean independence activist Ahn Chang-ho, known by his pen name Dosan — wrote in a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Wednesday morning that he was withdrawing the submission of family historical materials to Harvard “in direct consequence of” Japanese Legal Studies professor J. Mark Ramseyer’s controversial paper about comfort women, which is slated to be published in the International Review of Law and Economics.
“Comfort women” refers to women and girls from Japan’s occupied territories who were forced into sex slavery by the Imperial Japanese military before and during World War II. Against the historical consensus, Ramseyer claimed in his paper that these women were voluntarily employed. Since, mounting activism condemning Ramseyer’s paper at and beyond Harvard led the journal to delay publication and investigate concerns surrounding his paper.
Cuddy’s letter to Bacow marks the latest in a series of petitions and letters condemning Ramseyer’s paper and calling on Harvard to respond to the backlash. All the while, Harvard spokespeople and officials have kept quiet on the issue.
In his letter, obtained by The Crimson, Cuddy accused Bacow and the journal publishing Ramseyer’s paper of “hiding behind the veil of academic freedom” and criticized them for not sufficiently addressing Ramseyer’s “misrepresentation of history.”
Cuddy said in an interview with The Crimson that though he believes academic freedom is valuable, it is also crucial to “draw the line” when statements are not backed up by facts and research.
Responding to similar criticism that his claims lack historical evidence, Ramseyer wrote in a emailed statement last week that his article “speaks for itself.”
On Sunday, Ramseyer informed The Crimson he is putting together a “short package of materials on this topic” for release in the near future.
“Allowing employees to think they can hide behind academic freedom freely spewing such pointed false opinions about Comfort Women indicated Harvard is no place to deposit any of my archives,” Cuddy wrote in the letter.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed Bacow’s office has received the letter, but declined to comment further.
Negotiations between Cuddy and Schlesinger Library began in 2015. At the time, though, library administrators at Harvard had “no understanding” of the importance of his archives, according to Cuddy. Only after American history professor Jane Kamensky — who is also director of Schlesinger Library — became involved in 2019 did talks begin to progress, he said.
After meeting with administrators at UCLA, Stanford, and the Huntington Library in California, Cuddy and his sister Christine S. Cuddy ’71 decided in early 2020 to house their family archives at Harvard. Negotiations were subsequently halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Regarding Cuddy’s termination of negotiations with Harvard, Kamensky wrote in an email that the decision to donate family papers is a “highly personal” one and that it is the Library’s policy not to discuss potential acquisitions prior to an agreement.
In the early 20th century, Ahn Chang-ho, Cuddy’s grandfather, was a notable Korean independence activist who helped found the provisional Korean government in exile while the Japanese Empire occupied the Korean Peninsula. He and his wife were among the first Korean immigrants to the United States, where he organized political movements among Korean-American immigrants. Ahn is also reputed to have written the lyrics to South Korea’s national anthem.
Cuddy said the archival materials he had planned to donate to Harvard included Ahn and his wife’s personal items, documents pertaining to Korean-American organizing, and correspondence with the Korean government, among other items.
Cuddy said his top option for the donations is now the Huntington Library, instead of Harvard.

When Abigail S. Huebner ’23 was deciding which concentration to declare in fall 2020, she was hesitant about declaring engineering without having ever taken an engineering course in person.
“I was confused about how I was going to sort of learn what engineering was and get a feel for engineering without having any in-person component, and without having the labs and hands-on experience that I know is usually so crucial to understanding engineering,” she said.
But since deciding to declare engineering as her concentration, Huebner said she has been “pleasantly surprised” by her experience in online engineering courses, though she acknowledged “there’s still something missing.”
As the University nears the first anniversary of its transition to online learning due to the coronavirus pandemic, faculty and students at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have had to work hard to adjust their course plans for engineering students like Huebner.
Engineering courses are among those that face the greatest logistical hurdles in adapting to a virtual setting – equipment can often be expensive and immobile, while labs and group projects present a need for collaboration.
The plan outlined by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for the 2020-21 academic year requires all undergraduates to complete the entirety of their coursework remotely without access to labs, while graduate students currently have limited lab access to minimize in-person interaction.
Administrators and instructors have come up with a number of ways to attempt to compensate for the difficulties, including labs conducted at home using equipment mailed to students and remote-controlled technology, to mimic the in-person experience as best as possible.
Professor David C. Bell, who teaches Applied Physics 295: “Electron Microscopy Laboratory,” said labs have posed the greatest challenge during the last year of remote instruction.
“You can do the lectures remotely, because that’s just doing a lecture. That’s not really a problem,” Bell said. “But how do you do the lab classes?”
Despite the difficulty of replicating the lab component of engineering courses in a virtual setting, more than a dozen engineering students, faculty, and staff told The Crimson they feel the modified labs have been largely successful.
In many engineering courses, undergraduate students — whose lab coursework is completely remote per FAS guidelines — received kits to conduct labs at home.
Christopher J. Lombardo, associate director of undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, said the at-home labs for undergraduate students have been effective.
“The components we provided, I would say, give them the ability to do 90 or 90-plus percent of what they were able to do on campus, but from home,” Lombardo said.
Elaine H. Kristant, director for mechanical engineering at SEAS Active Learning Labs — a program that worked to improve the hands-on experience of SEAS courses even before the pandemic — and Active Learning Labs Mechanical Engineer Tony Turner said they have spent the past year designing and distributing lab kits for several engineering courses.
Kristant said she had to design labs enabling students to build structures at home without access to laboratory-grade machine tools.
Turner added that their primary consideration in kit design was student safety. Instead of an in-person walk-around and tool demonstration at the machine shop, Kristant made an “unboxing video” serving as a virtual training for the mailable kits sent to students scattered around the globe.
The ALL team had to navigate customs and international shipping regulations, which sometimes prevented students from receiving certain parts. Turner said he pushed for labs to be “team-based and very collaborative” to compensate for those unable to receive the right parts on their own.
One limitation of kit-based learning is that there is less room for students to learn from errors, Turner said; to combat this, kit design efforts have focused on “adaptability.”
“Engineering students learn a lot by making mistakes, by making things that do not work,” he said. “Typically in the lab if you mess up a part, we have more stock you can go cut more and try again. Within a kit, we cannot send 10 extras of every single item.”
Engineering concentrator Joshua A. Ng ’23 said he has been able to successfully learn from the at-home labs.
“Professors and teaching fellows have been able to reinvent the lab in-person hands-on experience, which I have definitely enjoyed, instead of just using my computer and just learning the theory, which is kind of boring stuff,” Ng said.
Jaxson T. Hill ’23, an engineering student, said since students complete kit labs asynchronously, he gets to experiment more on his own time, rather than rushing to finish a lab in a two-hour, in-person section.
But Engineering concentrator Amy L. Nichols ’23 noted that, as a sophomore, her limited experience with in-person lab classes before the pandemic makes the comparison harder.
“It’s kind of one of those things where I don’t really know what I’m missing until when I hopefully go back on campus soon,” she said. “Some people might know how to use a machine, and I just will have no idea.”
Still, some faculty decided to transition labs to a fully virtual format. SEAS professor Petros Koumoutsakos said he transitioned what would have been a hands-on fluid mechanics lab into a computerized simulation activity for students.
While the online simulation is the best virtual alternative, he said, it cannot “replace” an in-person lab.
Mohammad Souri, a SEAS simulation engineer who designed Koumoutsakos’s computerized lab, said developing digital labs for SEAS courses has “become really important” as a result of the pandemic forcing students from campus. Souri said his team developed an online learning environment to host lab simulations students can view from their computers.
Some courses which never had computerized labs requested that he and his team develop them in the absence of in-person experimentation, he added.
Normally, computer-based experiments would be done in SEAS in-house computer labs with specialized software. With students learning remotely, Souri said he simplified the software so it did not require training.
“I came up with an idea to make the app from that software so students don't need to know what's going on in the background, but they still can see the simulation in the app,” he said, referencing a thermodynamics lab he designed.
As Bell’s Applied Physics 295 is a graduate course, his students do have access to labs, but only one person can be in the lab at a time.
Bell’s solution has been an “upside-down” lab, where the instructor is remote while the student is in the lab.
“We thought, ‘Well, what we could do is we could actually let the students into the rooms by themselves and we would instruct them how to use the microscope, by Zoom call,’” he said.
Jules A. Gardener, a SEAS Imaging Engineer who assists Bell and his students with their labs, described a “three-pronged attack” in guiding students remotely through the labs: Zoom for direct communication, the software TeamViewer to remotely control equipment, and video demonstrations.
“Because these are very large, complicated pieces of equipment, we can actually log in with TeamViewer,” Bell said. “And if needed, we can actually run most of the operation of the microscope remotely.”
Another engineer who partners with Gardener, Adam C. Graham, said he views the effort as a success.
“It's definitely been working,” he said. “Every lab class that I’ve done, they’ve walked out being able to complete the objective and feel pretty good about it.”
Graham added that one positive is that students receive more one-on-one attention since every lab is completed solo, but, as a result, the total time he and Gardener spend in the lab has increased.
“We used to do a lab session with three to four people in each lab session, and that session would last about three hours,” he said. “Now, we’re spending three hours with each student.”
Bell, Gardener, and Graham also did acknowledge virtual instruction in the lab has slowed down the pace of learning.
“It’s taking us roughly twice as long to cover material in a remote fashion,” Bell said.
“We’ve kind of boiled it down to really the key concepts, and make sure that everyone gets to cover those because we’re having to go a little bit more slowly,” Gardener added.
Thinking in the long-term, the pandemic has forced professors to reconsider the way their engineering courses will be structured in a post-pandemic time.
The challenge of virtually directed labs for graduate students has reinforced the importance of face-to-face lab instruction, according to Bell.
“The biggest challenge is really the fact that you can’t be there to reach out over the shoulder of a student and press a button,” he said.
But others said they wonder if certain aspects of virtual engineering classes could be preserved even when learning resumes in person, based on noted successes.
“Maybe it’s a future hybrid situation with hugely declined lab time, but you know if you don’t finish things, just pick up your kit, take it back to your house, and complete it,” Lombardo said.
“That’s something we’re experimenting with,” he added. ‘I'm not sure we know the right answer, but this can help us start to try to answer those questions.”
Gardener added that the demonstration videos she and Graham have compiled could be helpful to students, who can rewatch them if they miss something, even when SEAS is fully operational.
“Everyone learns in different ways,” she said. “If there’s someone who wants to watch something multiple times, then they can do that.”
Lombardo added that certain long-run changes will inevitably take place – though Harvard has not unveiled its plan for fall 2021, it seems unlikely that engineering classes next fall will completely return to their pre-pandemic state.
“If we’re not 100 percent on campus in the fall or if we’re 100 percent on campus, does that mean we’re back to the way things were pre-Covid? Probably not,” he said.

Sections
Years from now, the Class of 2024 will be known by many things. We’re the class that started college on Zoom, the class that made the Widener steps the new hottest hub on campus, and the class who got the entire campus for ourselves for a semester. However, believe it or not, we have another legacy: we’re the class with the giant brown paper bags (thanks, HUDS!). As firm believers in recycling and craft-making, we (Alexandria and Ashton) will be flexing our creative muscles to transform these formerly boring giant paper bags into fun and awesome Harvard accessories to brighten this virtual Harvard semester!
*Insert the standard tutorial music*
Picnic Blanket
Outdoor socialization is basically the only socialization these days, and thus this comes in the form of many, many, many picnics. Picnics are awesome — food, friends, and the cold, wet ground that can stain your jeans. Just use that brown bag from the Berg, and flatten it into a picnic blanket! This blanket is lightweight, disposable, and impossible to forget as it is holding your food!
Protest Signs
Attending a socially-distanced protest, but don’t have any readily available cardboard to make signs? Fear not, as it turns out, giant brown paper bags make awesome signs. 
All you need is some tape, a pair of scissors, markers/Sharpies, and about three paper bags. Flatten the bags first, then stack them directly on top of each other. Make sure to fold the handles so they won’t poke out, then use the tape to attach them together. Write a message of support on either or both sides of your creation, and there’s your sign!
Common Room Decorations 
Let’s be honest, your common room is probably bland. To be fair, we were told to pack lightly… but with everyone spending the majority of our days in our room, there is some serious need for decor. What better way to use these brown bags than to turn them into a fun garland? Simple, cheap, sustainable, and easy on the eyes.
Umbrella
Did you forget to pack an umbrella to college? Are you too lazy to buy a new one? Are you sick of getting wet every time you walk outside? Well, it’s time to bust out those paper brown bags. Simply tape 2-3 bags to a stick and you will have a handmade umbrella to protect yourself from the incessant Massachusetts rain. Sure, the umbrella is not waterproof, and it’ll probably be gone after a trip to Annenberg and back. And the tourists probably will also give you funny looks. But hey, desperate times call for desperate measures.
Slippers
Yep, you read that right. You can make slippers from Annenberg giant brown paper bags. We sat down with Justin Z. Hu ’24 to talk about his impressive DIY project: making these bomb slippers. After watching some cool DIY videos online where people made slippers out of crushed soda bottles, Justin decided to put his own Annenberg twist on it.
For the toe caps of the slippers, which should be the strongest parts of the slippers, Justin cut out part of the bottom of the paper bags (since this area is the strongest of the entire bag). Next, he cut out a section of the bag wide enough to fit his feet. Then, with some mad folding skills and tape, Justin successfully created the world’s coolest and most Harvard pair of slippers ever.
Although nothing beats eating inside Annenberg with friends, when Harvard gives you giant brown paper bags, might as well have some ~sustainable~ fun with it. Especially when your idea of fun involves brown paper bag home decor and footwear!
