After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To our readers:
For the last century and a half, The Crimson has been committed to holding power to account at Harvard University, informing our readers while training the next generation of journalists. For most of our history, printing a daily paper was the fastest and most impactful way to fulfill that purpose.
Our mission — which has survived war, depression, and pandemic — remains fundamental and unchanged. But the form through which we fulfill it must be flexible.
Over the past two decades, our newspaper — and the journalism industry — has raced to keep up with the pace of the internet, where content is delivered faster and more creatively than it was when our presses first ran in 1873.
Today, an overwhelming majority of our readers interact with our content online. We must lead the way in embracing that reality.
This fall, The Crimson will make a historic change to harness the opportunity presented by the digital era: We will shift to producing a weekly print edition while recentering our operations and product to prioritize online content.
We understand the significance of this change: The University Daily will no longer appear daily in print. But this isn’t a move away from our commitment to covering Harvard every day — it is a step into the future that will allow us to improve the substance and delivery of our product while better serving our staff.
Producing high-quality independent journalism today requires an innovative digital-first approach. This change will allow us to invest our resources into meeting our readers where they are: online. And to prepare the next generation of journalists, we must train them on the tools of tomorrow — no longer just a broadsheet newspaper.
Undoubtedly, there remains an important role for print at The Crimson, which will take a new and improved form. In the fall, Issue No. 72 of the 149th Volume will come in a brand new weekly format that will be redesigned and expanded to include our best journalism, complete with the original reporting, analysis, and opinion our readers expect. Online, we will remain a daily news operation as we extend our commitment to providing minute-by-minute information to the communities of Harvard and Cambridge on our digital platforms.
On the day The Crimson celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Class of 1904 — president of The Crimson three decades earlier — was being inaugurated to a higher post. A group of editors hosting a celebratory dinner anxiously awaited word from FDR, whose universally famous acronym first began at The Crimson, where it is still a tradition to call each other by our initials. Shortly before the dinner, Roosevelt sent a telegram apologizing for his absence. “I’m sorry that I cannot attend your celebration,” he wired. “Keep the old sheet flying.”
Those words have served as the unofficial motto of​​​​ The Crimson ever since. With this change, we will seek to turn the challenge of our time into the opportunity of our new era and keep the old sheet flying for 150 more years.
Sincerely,
Raquel Coronell Uribe ’22-’23
President of the 149th Guard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University has agreed to increase its commitment to affordable housing construction in the first phase of its proposed campus expansion in Allston, earning the support of key Boston officials and clearing the way for the city to approve the opening stage of the school’s vast expansion plans in the neighborhood.
The University has committed to 25 percent affordability in Phase A of the proposed Enterprise Research Campus development, for a total of 86 affordable housing units, and will pay $25 million to establish a new affordable housing fund dedicated to Allston and Brighton.
The agreement was announced Tuesday in a press release from the city that included statements hailing the new plan from an array of key elected officials who have long been skeptical of the school’s proposed development. The new agreement is backed by the Harvard-Allston Task Force, according to the group's chair, Cindy Marchando.
The BPDA will vote on the new proposal on Thursday.
Harvard’s pledge to fund affordable housing marks a $5 million increase from commitments unveiled in a June 30 meeting with residents, where it pledged $20 million over 10 years. The additional $5 million will be paid from 2033 to 2035. The University’s 25 percent affordability commitment remains unchanged from the previous meeting, and in future stages of the ERC development, Harvard has only committed to 20 percent affordability.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 said in a press release that the agreement marks a “remarkable step forward” for affordable housing and is aligned with Allston’s needs.
“The development of Harvard’s land in Allston is of such scale and scope that the impact will shape generations to come—we must get this right for our communities,” Wu wrote. “I’m grateful to the many community leaders and activists who have shaped this agreement and who will continue to steer our focus for sustainable, equitable development.”
The 25 percent affordability commitment represents the largest percentage pledged by a private developer in the city’s history, according to the press release. The city’s Inclusionary Development Policy mandates that 13 percent of most new housing developments consist of income-restricted units, though the city has explored increasing this requirement to 20 percent.
The agreement also includes the donation of .9 acres of land at 65 Seattle Street to an affordable housing developer — another pledge intended to address Allston’s growing affordability crisis, which has seen median rent surge by 36 percent between 2011 and 2019 and the price of the average home rise from $350,000 to $500,000.
Kevin M. Carragee, co-president of Brighton’s Hobart Park Neighborhood Association, said in an interview that the University’s new pledges came only after “great pressure” from local organizers, and credited councilors and state representatives who advocated for residents of Allston and Brighton.
“Is this agreement in some ways better than where we were on the 30th of June? The answer is yes,” Carragee said. “The credit doesn’t go to Harvard University.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in a statement that the Wu administration, elected officials, and Allston-Brighton community leaders have all helped the project move forward.
“We appreciate all of the work that has gone into advancing this extraordinary project,” O’Rourke wrote. “We’re pleased to be on the BPDA Board agenda and look forward to the public hearing on Thursday.”
Clarification: July 14, 2022:
This article has been updated to clarify that the 20 percent affordable housing Harvard has committed to in future stages of its Allston campus expansion is not solidified as part of the current agreement it struck with city officials and residents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has agreed to support an array of affordable housing as part of its proposed campus expansion in Allston — enough to please local officials who have long pushed back against the University’s development plans.
But concerns from residents of Allston about Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus likely won’t disappear with the deal, which was announced Tuesday by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07.
Many aspects of the new agreement remain unchanged from a set of pledges the University unveiled at a public meeting on June 30, which some residents said wasn’t enough to address their concerns.
The meeting last month — hosted by the Boston Planning and Development Agency — featured presentations by Harvard and developer Tishman Speyer, and perspectives from the Harvard-Allston Task Force. During a public comment portion of the meeting, several residents criticized the University for insufficient collaboration with residents and said the proposal fell short of past promises.
The presentation centered on new affordable housing commitments and plans for a public greenway on the development.
Tishman Speyer upped its affordable housing commitment from previous filings, promising an affordability level of 25 percent in Phase A of the development, translating to 86 units of affordable housing — an increase from their previous pledge of 17 percent in June 2021, and nearly twice the city-mandated 13 percent.
Beyond Phase A, Harvard committed to 20 percent income restricted housing under the city’s Inclusionary Development Policy in future ERC developments. The University also announced plans to give more than $20 million over 10 years to fund affordable housing in Allston and Brighton.
Kevin M. Carragee, a member of the Coalition for a Just Allston and Brighton, said the promises were insufficient, and called on Tishman Speyer and Harvard to guarantee 33 percent affordability.
“The ERC as planned now will reproduce the problems and inequalities of the Seaport,” Carragee said at the meeting on June 30. “Will we be a place where working people can live and immigrants can live? That’s what’s at stake.”
In the agreement announced Tuesday, Harvard upped its affordable housing pledge to the Allston-Brighton fund by $5 million, which the University will pay from 2033 to 2035.
At the meeting, the developer also highlighted plans for a greenway helping to connect Rena Park to the Charles River, which were added since the master plan in 2018. In addition to the greenway, Harvard reiterated pledges that 20 percent of the ERC will be publicly accessible open space, and that over 800 trees will be planted to ensure at least 30 percent canopy cover of the area — commitments which were previously outlined in a letter to Wu in February.
Barbara Parmenter, a member of the HATF, said while Tishman Speyer presented “a very well-designed urban plaza,” the proposal falls short of Harvard’s past pledges — specifically, in that almost two-thirds of the greenway in Phase A would be paved, and that Harvard may redevelop the land after 99 years.
“It’s not the greenway the community was promised,” Parmenter said at the meeting. “The Task Force wants the rest of the greenway to be actually green with living soil and vegetation, not pavement.”
Still, the Harvard-Allston Task Force endorsed the agreement announced Tuesday for Phase A, according to its chair, Cindy Marchando.
At the meeting, Parmenter cited a letter from the Boston Parks and Recreation Department in March 2021 which called on Harvard to consider a more ambitious green space project that would link all the University’s holdings in Allston.
“There is an opportunity to provide a world-class open space system for a large area of
the city on a scale not seen in Boston since the creation of the Emerald Necklace,” the letter read. “Harvard should provide an open space plan that connects all four neighborhoods around a comprehensive framework of green infrastructure.”
Parmenter criticized the University for not responding to the letter in over a year. In a follow-up letter last October, the BPRD wrote that while Tishman Speyer provided written responses to the letter in its Draft Project Impact Report, the developer “did not modify its plans in response to the comments.”
Carragee, a professor at Suffolk University, said in an interview that Harvard’s decision to not respond to the letter’s recommendations reflects a broader lack of transparency in the University’s dealings with residents. Carragee also condemned the University withholding how much money it received from Tishman Speyer for development rights.
“If you’re committed to openness and transparency, but you're not committed to openness and transparency about the very economic structure of this new campus, then you’re not committed to openness and transparency,” Carragee said. “My Latin is enough that I know what Veritas means.”
In an email on July 6, University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote that many of the University’s new pledges at the meeting were in direct response to concerns advanced by residents of Allston.
“Harvard values working collaboratively with the City, BPDA, Task Force, elected officials, partners, community members, and others on our shared vision of creating an equitable, sustainable, innovative new district in Allston,” O’Rourke wrote.
The meeting also featured new details on Harvard and Tishman Speyer’s plans to address the transit needs created by the ERC, which the developer debuted in November.
The University announced a new Harvard shuttle route with free access to Allston-Brighton residents, to be launched with the completion of the Phase A. Harvard previously pledged $50 million to Allston’s proposed West Station following resident concerns about the ERC, though the station is not set for construction until 2040.
Jay Flynn, a transportation expert who spoke at the meeting, said that Harvard’s current transit pledges were inadequate to meet the demand that would result from the ERC, though he said Harvard’s offer to partially fund West Station was “a good first step.”
“The notion that you're going to be able to solve the transportation needs in the long term in the Allston area with buses on city streets is ridiculous,” Flynn said.
Flynn said in an interview that the jobs created by the new campus — 4,000 in construction as the campus is built and 5,300 permanent positions, per projections from Tishman Speyer — could result in a transportation “nightmare” if not properly accommodated.
During the meeting, Carragee said the ERC proposal is primarily intended to earn billions of dollars and called on the University to expand its affordable housing pledge.
“This project, the ERC, is an utter betrayal of Harvard’s social justice mission,” Carragee said. “This is a corporation acting not in the interest of our community, but in its corporate self-interest. It’s an embarrassing moment for Harvard University.”
The amended plans for the ERC will be considered by the BPDA on Thursday

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Crimson will shift to publishing a weekly print edition this fall in a historic move toward a “digital-first” future, the newspaper announced Thursday.
The Crimson will reduce its daily printing cadence but continue to publish online every weekday. The newspaper’s move follows in the footsteps of peer Ivy League publications — all of which have reduced their print frequency in recent years.
“Over the past two decades, our newspaper — and the journalism industry — has raced to keep up with the pace of the internet, where content is delivered faster and more creatively than it was when our presses first ran in 1873,” read a letter to readers published by the newspaper Thursday. “Today, an overwhelming majority of our readers interact with our content online.”
Crimson President Raquel Coronell Uribe ’22-’23 wrote in an emailed statement that the decision will provide the “opportunity of a new era” to innovate the paper’s digital and print formats.
“We will continue to be a daily news operation and maintain our regular online publication cadence,” Coronell Uribe wrote. “Meanwhile, we will be able to breathe new life into our print product. With the new weekly format, we will redesign and expand our content to include our best journalism, complete with the original reporting, analysis, and opinion our readers expect.”
The Crimson abruptly transitioned to an online-only daily format during the escalating Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. The paper did not resume daily printing until fall 2021, during which then-Crimson president Amanda Y. Su ’22 convened a working group of undergraduates and alumni to craft strategic recommendations regarding the paper’s digital future.
Dan Kennedy, a journalism professor at Northeastern University, said The Crimson’s transition to weekly printing while covering daily news digitally is a “natural move.”
“Print has continued to work for college newspapers longer than it has for papers in the real world, but like everything else, I think that the trends are starting to catch up with college newspapers,” he said.
Kennedy said the change will benefit students planning to pursue journalism after college, as professional newspapers are increasingly focused on digital content rather than print.
In their letter to readers, Coronell Uribe, Managing Editor Jasper G. Goodman ’23, and Business Manager Amy X. Zhou ’23 said the shift away from daily printing will improve both the staff and reader experience.
“This change will allow us to invest our resources into meeting our readers where they are: online,” they wrote in the letter. “And to prepare the next generation of journalists, we must train them on the tools of tomorrow — no longer just a broadsheet newspaper.”
Currently, the publication receives more than 200,000 weekly pageviews with tens of thousands of subscribers to its emailed newsletters, according to Coronell Uribe.
“In decades past, a print newspaper was the fastest, most impactful way to deliver our content, and allowed for the widest possible circulation,” Coronell Uribe wrote in the statement. “In 2022, this is no longer the case. In fact, our digital platforms allow us to inform our readers minute-by-minute, whether they are in Harvard Square or on the other side of the world.”
