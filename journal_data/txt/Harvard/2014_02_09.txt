After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, launched a campaign for lieutenant governor Friday morning in Central Square.
Last week, Cheung, a former venture capitalist, said that his prior experiences in municipal politics were what led him to contemplate the bid.
“I’ve learned a lot over the last four years as a Cambridge City Councillor,” Cheung said in an interview Feb. 4. “The issues that I’ve been tackling as a Cambridge city councillor and the challenges and opportunities that we’ve faced in the city are the same ones that exist in the Commonwealth.”
Cheung noted that, if elected, he hopes to continue the work of outgoing Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 in advancing infrastructure and education.
“That’s the biggest choice that we face in the election this year—are we going to continue the work that Governor Patrick has started...or are we going to go backwards?” Cheung said.
Cheung began serving on the Council in 2009, while pursuing his Masters in Public Administration at the Kennedy School. He also holds a degree from MIT’s Sloan School of Management.
“The education and experience really provided my framework for evaluating policy,” Cheung said of his time at the Kennedy School.
 
During his two terms on the Council, Cheung has passed more legislation than any of his peers. Cheung has championed the need for increased government transparency to improving methods used by Cambridge police as how to predict and gather data on crimes.  He also served as chair of the Economic Development, Training, and Employment Committee, introducing policies to help make Cambridge more attractive to entrepreneurs.
 
Cheung secured his seat on the Council for a second term after winning more votes than any other candidate for the nine-person Council in November 2013.
Cheung says those two terms have provided him with experience that he believes will serve to his advantage when he runs for state office. He now calls his city level experience “invaluable—not just in terms of thinking about what's right, but thinking about how you can actually make it happen.”
“People talk about helping the poor and investing in education. But working on a city council you get to see it face to face,” Cheung said. “You’re there working with teachers, you’re there working with kids who are trying to get into the innovation economy. You’re working with families that are trying to provide a better education for their kids, a better life for their family.”
The field of candidates vying for Lt. Governor will be considerably smaller than that of the Cambridge City Council election this past fall, with only six formal contenders as of Saturday.  Included are James Arena-Derosa, a former USDA administrator, Jonathan Edwards, a member of the Whately Board of Selectman, Steve Kerrigan, former CEO of the Democratic National Convention and a co-chair of the Obama’s second Presidential Inaugural Committee,  and Michael Lake, director of development for the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A colorful host of pink shirts, white balloons, and blue-clad Google recruiters greeted students as they entered Maxwell Dworkin Saturday morning to register for “WECode,” a conference launched this year by Harvard’s Women in Computer Science.
Saturday’s activities, which included speeches and workshops on coding, took place in rooms in the Science Center, Maxwell Dworkin, and the Northwest Science Building. Women from 40 colleges and universities were in attendance, according to WECode’s chief organizer JN Fang ’16.
Fang said that she initially thought of organizing a coding conference for women after reading “Lean In,” a book by Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 that encourages women to pursue their ambitions, in spite of the challenges facing them. 
“It was not so much the material or the statistics of the book that surprised me,” Fang said. “It frustrated me that there had to be a book…there had to be this prominent COO to speak in order for this to be a public issue that people would talk about.”
Fang, who had already been involved with Women in Computer Science, proposed the idea to her colleagues.
 “We had only about four or five months to prepare, so we were in a rush to begin with,” she said.
Although representatives from several private-sector companies were in attendance, Fang said that recruitment was not the primary purpose of the conference.
“This was created for one purpose, and that is to create community,” Fang said. “It is for that reason that we don’t have a job fair here.”
Rebecca Parsons, chief technology officer at the software development company ThoughtWorks, gave an inaugural keynote address Saturday morning. Parsons spoke of her experience in industry and of the hurdles that women still face in engineering fields.
Mohana P. Ramachandran, a graduate student in software engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology, attended the conference and said she found Parsons' speech "so inspiring." Ramachandran, who is originally from the Tamil Nadu state in India, also said she empathizes with many of Parsons’ feelings.
“In India, women in engineering are extremely underrepresented…. It is much harder for women to achieve roles of responsibility,” Ramachandran said. “We have to push ourselves, keep going forward.”
Kimberly Lockhart of cloud storage company Box and Goldman Sachs partner Marie L. Kirk gave two additional keynote speeches Saturday afternoon.
Fang, who worked at a company producing medical technologies in India last summer, also said that her experience with gender disparities abroad shaped her vision for the conference.
“Being in India specifically exposed me to a lot of the issues that women were facing there,” Fang said.
 
The conference continued through Sunday, when a hackathon took place at Harvard’s iLab in Allston.
Marcella Hastings, an undergraduate student in computer science at Tufts University, said that she appreciated her experience at the conference.
“[The organizers] did a great job, and I’m happy to be a part of it,” Hastings said.

Members of the Wampanoag Native American tribe convened at the Harvard Faculty Club Friday night for a clambake in honor of the tribe’s long standing ties with the University.
“It’s so important to celebrate and commemorate the shared history between Harvard and the Wampanoag,” said Tiffany L. Smalley ’11, the first member of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah to graduate from the College since Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck ’1665.
The Wampanoag tribe hails from Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, which includes present-day Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard.
Smalley noted that the Charter of 1650, the documents which establishes the Harvard Corporation as the governing body of the College, mentioned Native American students. In fact, it stated that the College should serve both “English and Indian youth.”
Attendees at the clambake included Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey Minister in Memorial Church, and the Honorable Tobias J. Vanderhoop, the chairman of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah and a 2008 Kennedy School graduate.
“While I was at the Kennedy School, I cherished the opportunities and knowledge that I could then bring back to my community,” Vanderhoop said. “But there is still a ways to go in terms of Native American inclusion.”
The Honorable Cedric Cromwell, chairman of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, agreed that more should be done to include Native American tribes.
Cromwell has orchestrated an effort to integrate Harvard with the Native American community. He lobbied the College to award Joel Iacoomes, a Wampanoag community member who attended the College but died in a 1665 shipwreck shortly before graduating, with a posthumous degree in 2011.
Yet Cromwell highlighted that Harvard must continue to foster relations with local tribes—particularly by recruiting more indigenous students.
During the 2018 admissions cycle, Native Americans were the sole group of non-white students whose application rates had not increased.
Judith Sanford-Harris, a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag Elders Council, said that Harvard can do more to create a welcoming environment for Native American applicants.
“More Native faculty—and not just faculty hired to teach Native studies courses—could attract some students,” Sanford-Harris wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Scholarships earmarked for Native students, in addition to the financial aid already offered, would also go a long way in encouraging students to apply and to matriculate if accepted.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little more than two weeks after Congress repealed 2013 restrictions imposed on the National Science Foundation’s Political Science Program, Harvard political scientists said that their federal funding is on surer footing.
“[The repeal] gives me more hope that in the future my research could qualify for a NSF,” said associate professor of Government Dustin Tingley, adding that imposing certification requirements on specific academic disciplines is “fundamentally undemocratic.”
The reinstated funding, included in a larger Congressional spending bill passed for the 2014 fiscal year in late January, restores several millions dollars cut by a March 2013 budgetary amendment that limited grants to projects that promoted “the national security and economic interests of the United States.” Sponsored by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn, the amendment limited the amount of federal funding available to political scientists at Harvard and elsewhere.
Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a government professor who has received funding through the NSF Political Science Program in the past, said that the amendment prevented “a lot of good research.” Now that the special conditions have been lifted, he said, political scientists at Harvard and elsewhere will have a higher chance to successfully apply for federal grants.
David M. J. Lazer, a visiting scholar at Harvard Kennedy School, who wrote extensively against the Coburn amendment on his blog, said that the certification requirements diminished the potential benefits that understanding the political system can offer to society.
 
A task force composed of members of the American Political Science Association presented to Congress a report on “negotiating agreement” in a polarized political arena in December 2013.
“I think one of the things that [the report] showed was how political science is helpful in understanding negotiation and achieving negotiation success, which a lot of people would portray Washington as having a hard time doing,” said Tingley,  a member of the task force, suggesting that political science organizations like the APSA played an important role in negotiating the repeal of the Coburn amendment.
“We and all of the other professional organizations in the social sciences are pleased that the Congress has recognized the importance of not having political interference in the setting of scientific priorities,” Kennedy School professor Jane J. Mansbridge, who served as the president of APSA in the academic year 2012-2013 and co-chaired the task force that produced the report, wrote in an email.
Still, despite the repeal, many say it will still be difficult for political scientists to receive full funding through the NSF, whose budget has been substantially reduced as a result of federal sequestration. For example, Government professor James M. Snyder said that prior to the passage of the Coburn amendment, he had received NSF political science grants for about 25 years, but had seen severe reductions in that funding in recent years.
“It was becoming less and less attractive to spend several weeks to write a grant proposal and then not get what you needed,” he said.
Snyder added that the NSF Political Science Program should shift its orientation and give preference to cutting-edge research as well as projects that represent “collective goods,” like the creation of large datasets that can benefit the entire political science community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators, alumni, and students celebrated the 100th birthday of the main buildings of Kirkland House, Smith Halls, Friday night. The ceremony, which took place in the house’s junior common room, also marked the renaming of the room as the Finnegan Family JCR in honor of Paul J. Finnegan ’75, a former Kirkland resident, prominent University donor, and current member of the Harvard Corporation.
Addressing a packed room, Finnegan reminisced on his time spent at Kirkland and praised the House system as a foundational aspect of student and University life.
“We have a lot of Finnegans that have experienced the joy of Kirkland House,” said Finnegan, whose father also lived in the house. Adding that the house system fosters “the creation of lifelong friendships,” Finnegan invited his college roommates, former residents of Kirkland B-51 and 52, to the stage during his speech.
“This house has meant so much to all of us, and those who know me well know that I wouldn’t say this lightly, but I really love these guys,” he said.
Michael D. Smith, dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who was present at the event alongside University President Drew G. Faust, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, and incoming dean Rakesh Khurana, recounted the history of the building and its role in solidifying house culture.
“Smith Halls themselves were originally freshman dormitories…. Upperclassmen lived around the yard until President Lowell came along and decided to create the house system in the 1930s,” he said. “This was certainly one of the cornerstones of that house system, as it was first built—Smith Halls together became what is now known as Kirkland House, and they say the rest is history.”
During the celebration, current Kirkland residents entertained attendees with dramatic performances, including a mock “Conversations with Kirkland” that saw the House’s re-animated namesake, John Thornton Kirkland, opine on the unchanged nature of the House and lament his poor performance in Kirkland’s annual game of “Humans vs. Zombies.” The Kirkland Drama Society performed an additional skit that featured a kazoo-smoking army general.
The night ended in a performance of “Ode to Kirkland,” an anthem penned by former resident and current House tutor Eric P. Lesser ’07, with the audience singing, “Oh Kirkland, oh Kirkland! Damn you are so fine! Oh Kirkland, Oh Kirkland, thank God that you are mine!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In basketball, box scores usually don’t tell the whole story. But when one team’s free throw percentage is less than the opposing squad’s three-point percentage, you may be able to draw a few conclusions.
That was the case on Saturday night, as the Harvard men’s basketball team (18-4, 5-1 Ivy) shot 56 percent from the charity stripe—14-of-25—while Yale (11-9, 5-1) connected from deep at a 60 percent clip.
With the game on the line and the clock running down, Harvard’s missed attempts—from the stripe and downtown—doomed the squad to its first home loss in over a year, falling to the Bulldogs, 74-67.
“We had our chances,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m surprised the score is what it is. I told the kids at the half we are lucky to be down four the way they are shooting [and] given what we did…. It’s hard for me to even look at [the statistics].”
Nearly everyone in Crimson struggled to make ends meet at the free-throw line—each Harvard player who went to the stripe missed at least one shot.
Ultimately, these missed attempts dug the Crimson too big of a hole, leaving it unable to capitalize on potential runs or Yale mistakes.
With just over two minutes to play, co-captain Brandyn Curry caught the ball in the right corner. The guard pump-faked, dribbled baseline, and found junior Wesley Saunders near the top of the key. Saunders faked a pass to his right and then fired a pass to senior Kyle Casey who was wide open for the dunk.
The play cut the Bulldog lead to six.
From that point forward, however, Harvard missed three three-point attempts, a free throw, and a layup, capping off a half in which it shot just 15.4 percent from deep and 37.5 percent from the field overall.
While the Crimson missed, Yale amassed—the visiting team notched its best performance from the charity stripe of the season, going 24-of-29, and connected on 60 percent of its three-pointers for the third time this year.
“We were challenged offensively,” Amaker said. “I’m thinking we’re a bit tired…. I don’t think we [had] a right to win and yet we were within a couple shots of making it close.”
STEALING THE LIMELIGHT
With shots not falling on the offensive end, Harvard was forced to step up the intensity on the defensive side. While the Bulldogs were efficient from the floor, shooting 51.2 percent on the night, it was getting those quality shots that troubled the Elis.
For the game, the visitors committed 19 turnovers, their most in a single game all season, while it was the sixth time this year that Yale tallied at least 15 mistakes. Harvard, on the other hand, turned the ball over only nine times, a number that would tie the Bulldog’s second-lowest total of the 2013-2014 campaign.
In fact, the only statistics in which Harvard topped Yale on Saturday night were defense-related. The Crimson collected more blocks and steals—and fewer turnovers—than its New Haven counterpart, enabling it to keep the game within reach.
The scores that resulted from two of these Bulldogs turnovers provoked some of the loudest ovations of the contest.
With 7:08 left in the game, a turnover from Bulldog Jack Montague fueled a coast-to-coast Curry fastbreak, which cut Harvard’s deficit to four for the first time since intermission.
The crowd at Lavietes Pavilion was on its feet, and Yale was on its heels.
Five minutes later, after the Eli lead was extended once more, sophomore Siyani Chambers did his best Curry impression. The point guard stole the ball from Javier Duren and tore down the floor, converting the layup seconds later.
The Yale lead was back down to six.
However, cold shooting the rest of the way would prohibit Harvard from coming much closer.
“It didn’t seem like [Yale had 19 turnovers,]” Amaker said. “I am pleased with [forcing those] turnovers because I thought we played with great effort. We gave great energy and effort defensively, and we did that all weekend.”
NO SOPHOMORE SLUMP IN SIGHT
In the 2012-2013 campaign, Chambers beat out Yale’s Justin Sears for Ivy League Rookie of the Year. While Chambers garnered a First Team All-Ivy selection, Sears got no such accolade. Nor was he placed on the conference’s Second Team. Or Third.
But one season later, Sears has come into his own. The 6’8” big man shot 6-of-11 in Saturday’s contest and connected on 9-of-10 free throws en route to a 21-point, game-leading performance. The sophomore notched almost as many defensive rebounds—eight—as the entire Crimson squad—13.
Sears’ double-double and command in the paint led Amaker to label him as a “monster” inside.
Sears played in only one of last season’s Harvard-Yale matchups, a game in which he shot efficiently, but failed to record a single rebound in 25 minutes, tallying three fouls and two turnovers instead.
Only 12 months later, Sears is fourth in the Ancient Eight in boards per game and tied for second in total rebounds.
“He is an outstanding player,” Curry said. “We knew going in that he was going to be a force in there. It was in our game plan to help out when he got the ball around the basket and dig in inside. He is a good player and he played really well.”

The No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team took on the No. 3 Yale team in New Haven, CT. on Friday night for a win that secured at least a share of the Ivy League title.
In five of its six wins that night, the Crimson (13-0, 6-0 Ivy) defeated its Bulldog opponents in three games. Yale (13-2, 5-1) notched three wins in the middle of the ladder.
“The men won 6-3 at the Ivy Scrimmage,” coach Michael Way said. “So it was an identical score for this match. We play Brown this week, but I think we have at least one hand on the trophy, for sure.”
At the No. 4 spot, Harvard’s co-captain Gary Power lost in four games to the Bulldogs’ Thomas Dembinski. Although Power had a strong third game and beat Dembinski by 10 points, he was unable to come back strong enough to secure a win. This is the first match this season that Power has lost so far.
The other two losses were matches played at the fifth and sixth seed. Senior Nigel Koh lost to his opponent, Kah Wah Cheong, dropping three straight games after having won the first. Freshman Bryan Koh’s match went to five games yet again, this time against Yale’s Liam McClintock. Koh’s fifth game ended in a 12-10 loss.
“I think the good thing is that the six games we won, we won almost all of them in three games,” senior Ali Farag said. “So if we play them again I don’t see any of us losing any of them, hopefully. The three we lost we lost in four or five games, so [they] can be converted to wins if we work really hard.”
At the bottom of the ladder, sophomore Nicholas Hopcroft bested Charlie Wyatt in three games to win the number seven match. The number eight seed, senior Thomas Mullaney also won in three, shutting out Yale’s Eric Caine.
“When players don’t volley, it’s usually because they’re nervous,” Way said. “So you have to address the heads first, and then you can address the tactics. If you never address the heads, you can’t reach the tactics.”
Junior Tyler Olson had a tougher match, dropping the third game to the Bulldogs’ Joseph Roberts before coming back strong in the fourth game to tally another win for the Crimson in the ninth position. Olson holds the team record for wins this season with 12 and carries a 12-0 personal record.
“It’s an individual sport,” Way said. “It’s about getting [the team] in the right headspace and recognizing what they need to do better than the last match, so from Trinity we’ve made our adjustments. Then, during the match, it’s a different strategy for each kid.”
Farag won his match in three games against Yale’s top player, Neil Martin. Farag has 11 wins this season, and is the only other team member to have won all his matches other than Olson.
“For myself, my match was pretty comfortably won,” Farag said. “I think Neil Martin is a good player, but I won in three games and I was happy with the way I played.”
In the number two and three spots, co-captain Brandon McLaughlin and freshman Dylan Murray swept their matches in three games, as well. McLaughlin defeated the Bulldogs’ Sam Fenwich, and gave up only 15 points total in three games. The wins helped Harvard to break Yale’s six-game winning streak.
“It’s not really what we focus on during the game as much as making the adjustments that we make after each match that we play in,” Way said. “So for every match that we play in, we review the videos, especially those who struggle. Win or lose we always look at the video, and we make the adjustments and we work on those and their mental state as well.”
The Crimson’s own 13-game winning streak sets the program’s record for a season. As of now, the squad is guaranteed at least a part of the Ivy League title.
“After winning on Tuesday [against Trinity], I was afraid that everyone would be overconfident and take this match too lightly,” Farag said. “However, I don’t know think that happened to anyone on the team. They all had the right attitude and they wanted to, of course, get the job done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, Harvard wrestling dug itself out of a serious deficit to claim the win. The squad found itself in an almost identical situation twice this weekend, but this time, it was unable to claw its way back into the lead on either occasion. The Crimson (3-6, 2-6 EIWA) fell to Penn (5-6, 3-3) and Princeton (6-2, 4-2) at the Malkin Athletic Center.
PRINCETON 19, HARVARD 17
The Crimson squad was handed a tough loss as it went head-to-head with Princeton on Saturday afternoon.
“Looking back, it’s hard because you feel like one small moment could have won that match for us,” junior co-captain James Fox said. “But we know that we’re right there, and that we just need to keep working hard for this last stretch of the season.”
Although Harvard won two of the first three matches, the Crimson was unable to maintain control of the contest.
“We’re a little bit beat up,” freshman Tyler Grimaldi said. “A lot of our starters were injured and couldn’t compete. Everyone stepped up and gave it their best, but I think it may have been a little bit different had everyone been healthy.”
In the fourth matchup of the contest, sophomore Nicholas Stager lost at the hands of Princeton’s Richard Krop (18-2), who managed to register a technical fall for the Tigers. Riding this momentum, Princeton went on a five match winning streak, defeating each of Harvard’s middle weight classes.
The upper weights anchored the Crimson, as Fox and sophomore Nick Gajdzik took consecutive wins against their opponents for Harvard, starting with Fox’s decision against Abram Ayala, 16-13, and followed by Gadjzik’s pin of Daniel Santoro at the 1:30 mark.
“James’s win was definitely a key moment for our team,” Grimaldi said. “It got everyone riled up for the last match, and Gadjzik also had a huge pin for us. Although we didn’t win the match, it brought us a lot closer and gave us a lot of fire for our next matches.”
The other wins for the night were registered by junior Ryan Osleeb and sophomore Todd Preston, at the 133 and 141 positions, respectively. Osleeb notched a technical fall over Jake Intrator, 16-0, while Preston registered an overtime decision against Jordan Laster, 3-1.
“Going forward, we want to focus on peaking at the right time,” Grimaldi said. “Everyone’s going to remember what we do at the end of the season, so we want to focus on improving and make sure we’re at our best at the right time.”
PENN 23, HARVARD 15
In the first match of the weekend’s at-home competition, Harvard felt the pressure early on against the Quakers.
“In general, Penn is a really tough team this year in the Ivy League,” Fox said. “We knew it was going to be a close match, we had some key match ups that we needed to win, and unfortunately they just didn’t go our way.”
Four different wrestlers on the Crimsons squad registered personal wins for the night, but these efforts were not enough to propel the team to victory against the Quakers.
“I don’t think we wrestled to the absolute best of our potential,” Grimaldi said. “There’s a couple little things everyone could have fixed. That being said, everyone put up a hard fight, but it showed us that we still have a lot to learn.”
Sophomore Max Mejia was the first of the Crimson squad to fall, as Penn’s Jeremy Schwartz outmaneuvered him at the 125-lb weight class to kick off the contest.
This early deficit for Harvard was widened as sophomore Jeffrey Ott lost to Penn’s Ken Bade. Ott gained the initial lead with a takedown and reversal early in the first period, but this momentum quickly turned as Bade registered his own reversal and managed to pin the sophomore on his back to register the fall. With this, Bade took the win 9-0, bringing the Crimson’s team score to 0-9 as well.
Preston broke the losing streak for Harvard, as the first of the Crimson to get on the scoreboard. After a final takedown, Preston managed to notch the decision over Jeff Canfora, 6-2, in the 141-lb weight class.
Another standout performance came from Fox, who registered his tenth victory of the season against Penn’s Frank Mattiace in a decision, 5-3.
Penn’s team was anchored by two nationally ranked wrestlers, No.19 Casey Kent and No. 10 Lorenzo Thomas, each of whom registered crucial wins for the Quakers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whatever the Harvard women’s basketball team did to rectify its cold shooting at the Palestra last week seems to have done the trick.
Fueled by hot shooting Friday night against Brown (7-12, 1-4 Ivy) and tough defense against Yale (10-10, 4-2), the Crimson (15-5, 5-1) finished off its four-game road trip with wins and now sits atop the Ivy League with sole possession of first place.
“This weekend was huge,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s the toughest part of our schedule. We still have to go to Cornell and Columbia, but I love where we are, in first place alone. We still have to take it one game at a time. Anything can happen.”
HARVARD 58, YALE 57
Clinging to a three-point lead with 14 seconds left, the Crimson saw it dwindle down to one as Yale guard Sarah Halejian knocked down two free throws. Harvard senior guard Jasmine Evans couldn’t hang on to the ball on her team’s ensuing possession, and the Bulldogs suddenly had a chance to snatch the win.
As it had done all night, Yale fed the ball to sharpshooting Halejian, but defensive pressure forced her to take an errant three, and the victory was Harvard’s, 58-57.
“Talk about a team win,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “So many people stepped up in so many important ways and just came together so well. I think [Harvard men’s basketball coach] Tommy Amaker said it, but the Ivy League is won on Saturday nights, so it feels great to get this win.”
Halejian, who notched 29 points in last season’s loss to Harvard, burned the Crimson with 19 points in the first half, giving Yale an eight-point advantage heading into halftime.
But junior forward Erin McDonnell wasn’t about to let Harvard drop another Saturday game. McDonnell scored 10 straight on a 10-5 Crimson run early in the second half to give the visitors the lead for the first time in over 20 minutes of play.
The Bulldogs responded with a three from forward Janna Graf and kept it tight down the stretch, not allowing Harvard to build more than a seven-point lead. Though the Crimson wasn’t able to replicate its 60-percent shooting performance from the night before, an amped-up second-half defense kept the home team from ever making up the deficit. Halejian was held to just eight points after the break.
“They have a really nice player in Halejian, and she had the game of her life,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our defense is good, and they just stayed in and shot, played unbelievable…. We just played our hearts out, and the game was won on incredible team defense, and individual defense by [senior forward] Missy Mullins in particular.”
McDonnell tied her season high in scoring with 17 points—15 of which came in the second half—and notched her first double-double by adding 11 boards. Evans poured in 11 points from the bench, and Clark joined her in double figures with 10.
HARVARD 91, BROWN 71
After shooting a season-low 18.3 percent from the field against Penn, the Crimson nearly quadrupled its offensive production in the first half against the Bears, totaling 53 points before the break. The 20-point margin heading into halftime proved too much for the home team to overcome, and Harvard notched its fourth Ivy win at the Pizzitola Sports Center, 91-71.
“Everybody was hitting wide-open threes,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were on in the Brown game. That’s not a surprising comeback after what happened at Penn…. I think it was only fitting that we prove to ourselves that we can shoot."
Brown was unable to penetrate the Harvard perimeter defense for much of the first half, settling for tough long-range jumpers and three-pointers that often missed their mark. The Bears shot at just 29 percent before halftime while the Crimson hit 76 percent of its shots.
Harvard jumped out to an early 12-0 lead less than four minutes into the game, causing Brown coach Jean Marie Burr to pull the entire starting lineup from the floor. The Bears bench did not fare much better—it finally put points on the board but was still unable to stop the Crimson’s hot shooting as the game quickly become one of catch-up for the home team.
“We jumped out to a pretty quick lead, but I think the challenge at Brown was to maintain that defensive consistency and I think that came in big at Yale,” Clark said.
Back-to-back treys from Brown guards Lauren Clarke and Sophie Bikofsky pulled the Bears within 13, but Evans countered with her own three, and Brown would never close the gap any further. Only three Brown players managed to score more than two points in the first half on Harvard’s stingy defense. The Bears shot at 46 percent after halftime, but the Crimson never let off the gas pedal, tallying its first 90-point-plus game since Nov. 2013.
Clark led the team with 19 points on 7-for-11 shooting while sophomore guard Kit Metoyer nearly doubled her previous season high, recording 17 points, including five buckets from downtown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a day for the record books for the Harvard track and field team, with a flurry of school and league records falling after strong performances by the Crimson.
The team split up and competed in two separate meets on Saturday, with most of the distance runners, middle distance runners, and jumpers heading to nearby Boston University for the Valentine’s Invitational. Meanwhile, sprinters and throwers competed at the Collegiate Invitational in Armory, New York.
BU VALENTINE'S INVITATIONAL
Senior distance runner Maksim Korolev had one of the strongest showings of the weekend when he beat the school record for the 3K—previously set in 1997—by nearly six seconds with a time of 7:51.52. His 3000-meter performance on Saturday was the third-fastest time in the country this season and set a new Ivy League record.
However, Korolev wasn’t the only Harvard runner having a history-making meet at the Valentine Invitational, as senior James Leakos, sophomore Tom Purnell, and junior Molly Renfer all contributed performances that put them in the top-five in Harvard history.
Leakos took first place in the 5K race with a time of 13:51.22, the second-fastest time in Crimson history. Purnell claimed the fourth spot in Harvard’s record books in the mile with a time of 4:03.26, while Renfer claimed the second-fastest time in Crimson history on the women’s side with a mark of 4:30.35 in the mile event.
“With our sport, it’s really a long-term proposition,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It doesn’t happen overnight, or [in] one week, or something like that. It’s been very much in the making for a long time now. It’s a combination of [having] some tremendously talented student-athletes, but also I think probably the biggest variable is just how hard they’ve been working and how dedicated they’ve been for an extended period of time.”
In addition, the women’s distance medley team claimed first place with a time of 11:47.92.
“The competition in the DMR wasn’t too bad” Renfer said. “I had the lead leg so I got out quite hard, and then we had a pretty big gap most of the time, so we just had to use our own strength to push through. It wasn’t too contested, but we all ran well so that was good.”
COLLEGIATE INVITATIONAL
While some of the Crimson competed in Boston, the rest of the squad took on over 100 schools at the Collegiate Invitational in Armory, New York. Harvard had a strong performance in the event, with multiple runners setting school records and personal bests.
The women’s 4x400 relay team—composed of freshman Jade Miller, sophomore Autumne Franklin, freshman Jackie Modesett and junior Gabrielle Scott—took fourth in the event while setting a new school record. In the anchor position, Scott had the fastest split time of the group, finishing her portion of the race in 53.5 seconds. As a whole, the team finished in 3:39.49.
In the throwing events, freshman Nikki Okwelogu was another bright spot for the Crimson, as she contributed a season-best throw in the shot put of 14.82 meters. The freshman has had strong performances all year, winning the event last weekend at the Harvard Invitational as well as at the Battle of Beantown meet just a few weeks prior.
The entire Crimson squad will come back together next weekend to compete in New Haven against Yale and Princeton in the annual HYP meet.
“There’s a lot of momentum right now in the program, and we’re excited to see that continue,” Saretsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (8-2, 7-0 Ivy) had a strong start off the block this season and continued its tear through the final lap as it completed their dual meet season Saturday against Penn (6-4, 4-3). The Crimson earned a 182.5-115.5 victory over the Quakers to complete its sweep of its Ancient Eight competitors this season and earn its second consecutive dual meet title.
The meet was the last time Harvard’s eight seniors would compete in a regular season dual meet. Four of those seniors competed in the final event to close out the meet. Co-captains Chris Satterthwaite and Oliver Lee combined with classmates Jack Pretto and Danny Crigler to finish the 400 freestyle relay with a time of 3:00.80 seconds.
Coming off of its biggest wins of the year at last weekend’s sweep of Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, the Crimson built on its momentum in its final meet before Ivy League Championships.
“We had some goals for the meet,” freshman Eric Ronda said. “For the rest of the kids who didn’t taper for the HYP meet [the goal was] that they taper for the Penn meet and get their best times of the season. Also another goal was to attack our races going out so we know the speed we have for Ivy championships.”
Ronda was victorious in the 100 breaststroke with a time of 56.73 seconds and the 200 breaststroke with a time of 2:03.68 seconds.
“My personal swims were pretty good considering we had picked up the intensity and yardage of our training last week, and we were much more broken down than we were at our HYP meet the weekend before this,” Ronda said. “Although I didn’t get the times I did at HYP, they are good for this point in the season.”
Fellow freshmen Jack Manchester was also able to capture a first place finish for Harvard with a win in the 200 backstroke to continue his strong rookie season.
Throughout the meet, the Crimson won more than just the first place spot. Harvard also earned points with second and third place finishers. Harvard was able claimed the one-two combination five times throughout the day and sweep all three top spots three times.
“Having such a depth in our team allows us to race each other in practice, and it helps us win our meets, going one-two or one-two-three,” Ronda said. “Other teams may have one star, [but] if they get first we come in second, third and fourth so it helps a lot.”
Despite the loss, three Quaker swimmers broke pool records. Penn was victorious in five events on the day, including wins in the 200 medley and 400 freestyle relays.
On the diving platform, junior Mike Mosca continued his dominant 2013-2014 campaign. Mosca swept both the 1-meter and 3-meter contests against the Quakers, making it the fifth time this season he has claimed victory in both events. He finished with a score of 345.83 on the 1-meter and 365.02 on the 3-meter.
“3-meter is definitely my preferred event because it’s higher, and you can do more difficult dives,” Mosca said. “The more difficult dives you can do, the more fun the competition is. It’s just better to watch and compete.”
Senior diver Joe Zarrella took second place in both events with scores of 328.80 on the 1-meter and 339.30 on the 3-meter.
Overall, Harvard had 10 event wins to end its dual meet season.
“This meet was more just a stepping stone where the swimmers taper,” Mosca said. “We have the dual meet championship title, so we should be the favorites going into ivies, and it’s always good to have that knowledge that we can win going into it.”
The team will host the Ivy League Championships at Blodgett Pool from Feb. 27th through March 1st.
“We have been level headed because the Crimson has won Ivy championships the past few years,” Ronda said. “Although we have our heads high now, we are staying really focused, and we still know it’s going to be a fight at Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second weekend of competition, the Harvard women’s water polo team (4-1) headed south to take on a trio of opponents at this year’s Princeton Invite. The Crimson came out strong with back-to-back wins to open the weekend before suffering the first loss of its season in the final game of the tournament.
WAGNER 11, HARVARD 8
Facing the Seahawks, the Crimson battled in a physical game that saw defense as the focus at both ends of the pool. The match was a back-and-forth contest in the opening half, with Wagner taking a slight 7-6 advantage at the end of the second period.
The third stanza of competition was Harvard’s downfall. Wagner netted three goals in the period, while the Crimson answered with just one goal, leaving the team down by three with eight minutes left in the game.
“Wagner is a very good team,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “They have very good two-meter play, and they are a very fast and strong team. I think it caused us a few issues offensively that we hadn’t seen yet…. We missed some shots down the stretch, and they converted their shots.”
The Crimson was able to tally a goal in the fourth period of play, but the Seahawks struck with a net of its own and went on to hold the Crimson for the rest of the match.
Senior Jelena Cyr led Harvard with three goals on the night, with sophomore Rachel Lobato and senior Shayna Price each contributing two goals. Sophomore Yoshi Andersen and junior Victoria Frager tallied four steals each, while junior goalie Ariel Dukes made eight saves.
“We were able to see things that we needed to work on with our game against Wagner because I think it was the first time we teamed up against a team that was that physical,” Andersen said. “We had to really dig down deep. Although we didn’t win, I think we learned a lot.”
HARVARD 13, IONA 12
In their second meeting in as many weeks, the Crimson and the Gaels took the competition into extra minutes. Going back-and-forth throughout the game, the two teams tied at the end of regulation, sending the contest into overtime.
In the first overtime, Harvard netted two goals that proved to be the determining factor in sealing its victory. Iona was able to close in on the Crimson’s lead with a goal late in the second overtime, but it was too late. Harvard’s defense came through on the final play of the game when freshman Zoe Osbourne came up with a shot block, sealing the Crimson’s victory.
“Iona is a very good opponent, and it’s been a rivalry team before I even got to Harvard,” Andersen said. “I think we both really go for it, and I think one of the ways we were able to come out on top is that we were really able to settle down…. Once we tied it up we knew we needed to relax and play Harvard water polo.”
Harvard found itself in a 4-3 hole against the Gaels after the opening period. The Crimson surged back in the second quarter to go up by three goals at the half, taking an 8-5 advantage into the second half of play.
Cyr led Harvard with four goals, followed by Andersen, who contributed three. Dukes made six saves in the win.
“This team has shown a lot of heart,” Minnis said. “We may get down, but if they believe that they have an opportunity, they keep on fighting and playing like it’s a close game.”
HARVARD 16, VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE 6 
In its first game of the weekend, the Crimson took a lead in the opening half of the game and never looked back in its commanding 10-goal win against the Keydets.
With a comfortable 10-3 lead after halftime, Harvard stayed on top of Virginia Military Institute for the entirety of the game.
Three Crimson players scored more than one goal in the win. Andersen led the team with five, freshman Melissa Balding tallied four, and classmate Melissa Martinelli added two scores in the victory.
“We are going to continue to do the things we’ve been doing in practice and focusing on all phases of the game, both offensively and defensively,” Minnis said. “I think for us it’s all about seeing the whole pool and getting up on our lane and making good passes and good pressure passes as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may have been the Winter Carnival this weekend in Hanover, N.H., but there was little to celebrate for Dartmouth hockey enthusiasts as the Big Green (7-16-1, 6-11-1 ECAC) fell to the No. 4/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey team, 4-1, on Friday night at Thompson Arena. The win was the Crimson’s fourth straight against its northern Ivy foes.
“I thought that we came out fast,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “One of our main goals heading into the game was to start with a lot of speed and get the first goal so we could have the momentum the rest of the game.”
After slow starts made tough contests of the past two games—a tie at Quinnipiac on Feb. 1 and a loss to Northeastern in the Beanpot semifinals last Tuesday—speed was a priority for Harvard (18-3-3, 14-2-2). Crowe put the Crimson on the board 2:37 into the contest off a feed from sophomore forward Miye D’Oench and work behind the goal from captain Marissa Gedman.
Crowe, who ranks second on the team in both points and goals, notched the final score of the contest. With just 20 seconds left in the game and a two-goal lead, sophomore Mary Parker fired a pass to Crowe, who drove the puck past Dartmouth goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft.
Crowe’s two tallies were matched by D’Oench, Harvard’s leading scorer, who has scored 14 goals and notched 10 assists thus far this season. D’Oench scored her first goal 6:36 into the second frame, as she wrestled the puck out from the Crimson zone and led a fast-break play across the ice, connecting with the bottom left corner of the Big Green goal.
“I strained the goalie and put her eyes away,” D’Oench said. “When I put it towards the net, she couldn’t see it so it dribbled in. That was a huge play.”
With under a minute to go and just a one-goal deficit, Dartmouth pulled Holdcroft from between the pipes hoping to even the score. Less than 10 seconds later, the home team would come to regret that decision, as the Crimson capitalized on the empty net opportunity. Harvard junior defender Sarah Edney fended off a six-person Big Green attack and found an open D’Oench, who slipped the puck past the crease to increase her team’s lead.
“The play kind of got broken up in the neutral zone,” D’Oench. “It went to Edney, who passed it to me, and I was able to put it in the empty net.”
D’Oench, whose team-high 24 points exceeds her total from last season by nine, has become a keystone of Harvard’s offense this season, as graduations from the College and attrition to the US Olympic Team depleted the squad’s roster to a number far smaller than what most competitive teams play with.
“A lot of it is being in the right place at the right time,” D’Oench said. “I’m playing with really talented players. A lot of my goals have been some really nice feeds so I really can’t take credit for a lot of it.”
The two forwards may have been the only Crimson players to score, but a well-balanced and quick team made the win possible. Ten different skaters registered shots, and 3-of-4 goals were assisted.
Sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer tallied 27 saves, while Harvard’s defensive core rendered Dartmouth ineffective on the power play, going 5-for-5 on the penalty kill.
“[The penalty kill] has always been one of our main focuses throughout the entire year,” Crowe said.
“We spent a majority of the time the practice before [the Dartmouth contest] analyzing their power play and what we need to do to minimize their chances. I think everyone is staying disciplined and placing a lot of importance on the penalty kills.”
The league victory might be just what the Crimson needs heading into the Beanpot consolation round and the final weekend in Cambridge of the regular season—a home stand against Clarkson, ranked third in the ECAC, and St. Lawrence, which sits at fifth in the conference.
“It was a really good win,” D’Oench said. “We really controlled the plays for the majority of the game…. In terms of the momentum of the team, it was a huge win, and also the way we played I think we should be very proud of. Dartmouth can be a tough team and it was a very physical game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (2-3, 1-0 EIVA) opened its conference season with a resounding win away from home at Sacred Heart (3-5, 0-1 EIVA). The Pioneers' offense was completely stifled by the Crimson defense, being held to a hitting percentage of -.047.
“I’m very happy with how the team played,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “I think we overall put together a very solid game, and we won the match 3-0. You can’t ask for a better way to start a season.”
Each set followed a familiar pattern as Harvard would start out hot, jumping out to an early lead but with Sacred Heart still within reach. In all three matches, a decisive run by the Crimson put the game away.
In the first set, Harvard led by three, 16-13, before wrapping things up with a solid 9-4 run. In the second, despite at one point leading 17-7, the Crimson needed to surge and take the final four points behind Branden Clemens’ serving after the Pioneers had brought things back to 21-18.
Once again in the third, a close-fought set came to a close after Harvard ended the match with an 8-3 run down the stretch to put the game out of reach.
Throughout the match, Harvard’s blocking put tremendous pressure on the home team. Senior Kyle Rehkemper paced the Crimson with six total blocks, keeping the Pioneers at bay.
“Our blocking was really good,” Madden said. “We got a lot of blocks and especially a lot of solo blocks. Kyle [Rehkemper] had a great game, DJ [White] had a great game hitting, and Caleb [Zimmick] had a great game hitting over the middle. All around, we played a pretty good game, but especially our blocking was the key.”
Even with the win, there were areas that Harvard will look to improve in the coming weeks as it continues conference play.
“Mainly it’s all small things [we need to work on],” Clemens said. “Little execution errors—little things that we know how to do and that we do in practice, but we need to reinforce it so you automatically do it in the game. We’ll figure it out in practice.”
Harvard coach Brian Baise has altered his team’s practices to better simulate the conditions of a live contest. Increasing the intensity in practice has the twin purpose of reducing in-game errors and augmenting the players’ competitive energy.
“Coach has changed the structure of practice and has made a lot of the drills super competitive, putting us in high pressure and high intensity situations,” Madden said. “In the game, we came out a little more fired up, and that got us off to a great start.”
“The aggression and the overall sense of energy has been really good,” Clemens said. “We were kind of reinvigorated and were very pumped to get our first conference win, and I think that will continue into this week.”
The team will be looking to take that energy forward as it faces two tough opponents in Princeton and George Mason at home this Thursday and Friday. Both teams made the EIVA playoffs last season and will be a stern test of the Crimson’s mettle.
“We have two wins on our record now, and it was good to get our first win in the league. But we’re not going to get a big head,” Madden said. “We have two great teams coming to our place on Thursday and Friday. Both of them are very good this year, and we’re fully focused on them right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late Sunday afternoon, both the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams were hoping for a little bit of help heading into the final matches of the Ivy League Round-Robins. With the Ivy League title for both teams coming down to bouts that did not include the Crimson, the Harvard men came away with a share of their second-straight Ivy League title while the women had to settle for second, despite freshman sabre fencer Adrienne Jarocki’s undefeated record.
MEN'S FENCING
Having lost a 14-13 nail-biter to No. 1 Columbia early on Sunday, the Crimson needed No. 5 Princeton to beat the Lions for a share of the title. But with the Tigers down, 12-10, with five bouts remaining, it seemed as though the Harvard men would come back to Cambridge empty-handed.
But Princeton, whom the Crimson had beaten, 18-9, the previous day, mounted an unlikely comeback, winning the next four bouts against the top-ranked team in the nation. The Tigers’ upset gave Harvard a share of its second-straight Ivy League title and eighth crown in program history.
“We went from a very dire mood—the guys were on the verge of tears when we lost to Columbia—to resurrection that occurred in basically the last event of the day,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said.  It was just one of those roller-coaster days.”
Though the team was ranked sixth in the country coming into the weekend, the Crimson needed to turn things around after a 1-4 showing at the St. John’s Invitational two weeks before. The men set the tone on Saturday with three convincing wins over top-flight opponents.
Harvard blew past Yale in the first round of the weekend, 22-5, with sophomore sabre fencer Duncan O’Brien, freshman épéeist Alexander Eldeib, and the foil trio of sophomore Michael Woo, junior Brian Kaneshige, and sophomore Jerry Chang each going 3-0 against the Bulldogs.
“[Duncan] was a walk-on for the Harvard team and fourth in [today’s] sabre event,” Brand said. “He even managed to defeat both the gold medal reigning NCAA champion and the silver medal winner. It was quite an accomplishment for him.”
The Crimson kept up the momentum against No. 5 Princeton, defeating the Tigers 18-9 on the backs of the sabre fencers’ 7-2 record for the match. The same three sabre fencers–O’Brien, senior Eric Arzoain, and junior Alexander Ryjik–went 8-1 against the Penn in the 19-8 victory over the Quakers.
On day two, Harvard stared down a Columbia team looking to avenge its 15-12 defeat at the hands of Crimson at last year’s Ivy League Round Robins. The groups began with the Lions taking the sabre portion of the match, 6-3, and Harvard bouncing back to win foil, 6-3.
But Columbia’s épéeists were not going to allow a repeat of the 2013 championship. Down 13-12 after Eldeib’s win over the Lions’ Justin Wan, Columbia won the final two épée bouts to take down the Crimson’s épée trio, 5-4, for the 14-13 win.
Though Harvard bounced back with a 17-10 triumph over Brown, the Crimson left their final position in the hands of the Tigers, who were facing then-unbeaten Columbia on different strips.
Upset-minded Princeton went up 10-8 with 5-4 wins in the sabre and foil parts of the match. Though the Lions won épée, 5-4, the final scorecard read 14-13 in favor of the Tigers, and Harvard clinched a share of the title. Chang, Ryjik and Woo were named to first-team All-Ivy, and O’Brien and Eldeib earned second-team accolades.
WOMEN'S FENCING
 
Led by Jarocki’s 18-0 record for the weekend, the Harvard sabre squad didn’t drop any of its six matches. But the team’s 15-12 loss to the Tigers in the second match of the round-robin tournament ultimately kept the Crimson from its first league title since 2009.
“We came really close against Princeton, and unfortunately, things didn’t work out,” freshman foilist Liana Yamin said. “But I think we did everything we could have.”
While Harvard was busy beating Brown, 20-7, in its final match of the day, Princeton and Columbia paired off in a match that had title implications. After the Crimson men had rooted for the Tigers to beat Columbia the same day, the tables were turned, with the Harvard women hoping the Lions would somehow beat the defending Ivy champs.
“We were fencing right on the side [of the other match], so we didn’t watch,” Yamin said. “We were focusing more on our own fencing and keeping down ground instead of if Columbia beats [Princeton].... We were more about how we can fence and turn it around.”
But a second upset in favor of the Crimson wasn’t in the cards on Sunday afternoon, and the Tigers went on to clinch Ivy League title with a 6-0 record for the weekend.
“Coming in second was a great accomplishment for our women,” Brand said. “Overall, I’m very happy with what we’ve accomplished. Certainly, we thought we had a shot on the women’s side this year—we came close, but I’m very, very happy with the result.”
With a 5-1 finish, Harvard finished alone in second place in 2014 after taking third the previous season. The women also brought multiple individual awards back to Cambridge, with Jarocki leading the way as the Outstanding Rookie Performer, Outstanding Performer, and first-team all-Ivy honors.
“She’s just a freshman and still has so much more time to do all she can do [with] NCAA’s coming up,” Yamin said. “I’m very proud of her as a teammate–she came in as a really good fencing and proved that this weekend.”
Sophomore Aliya Itzkowitz’s 15-3 record in sabre earned her first-team honors, while captains Kara Lee and Alexandra Kiefer, sophomore Isabella DiTella, and junior Emma Vaggo were named to the second-team.
