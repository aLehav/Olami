After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The entire Harvard community was rightly shocked and appalled at the two sexual assaults which were perpetrated on or near Harvard Yard this August. The events marked the first incidences of stranger rape on the Harvard campus in more than a decade, sparking fear and concern among students, faculty, and local residents alike. Yet, the wide reporting of these crimes also call to light an unfortunate truth: that we are only aware of them because they were reported to the Cambridge and Somerville police, respectively, rather than HUPD or the Office of Sexual Assault Response and Prevention, which do not release information on sexual assaults.
Our administration is woefully tight-lipped when it comes to providing the community with critical information on sexual assaults, especially location. While we acknowledge the concerns that motivate the withholding of such data—especially those related to protecting the victim’s anonymity—we believe that the safety of the community demands that more information on campus sexual assaults be released. The decision not to release such information indirectly contributes to the malignant and widespread ignorance of acquaintance rape on campus.
While the incidents of August 10th and 14th mark the first stranger rapes in the past decade at Harvard, HUPD reports that it receives an average of four reports of acquaintance rape per year, a figure that does not include those that are reported exclusively to services such as OSAPR. Acquaintance rape is notably more common, accounting for 90 percent of sexual assaults perpetrated against college students, according to one Department of Justice study.  Yet the administration does not release even the most basic information on these incidents.
Furthermore, the language of the official administration communication, which treat these two events as entirely unique in their category and an unexpected departure from Harvard’s otherwise serene hustle-and-bustle, reinforce the erroneous and common—if subtly held—perception that stranger rapes are more worthy of shock, disgust, and outrage than assaults where the assailant is known to the victim. We ought to remember that while the events of August are deplorable and tragic, members of our community suffer from such crimes much more often than recent headlines would suggest.
Harvard’s insistence on withholding basic information on sexual assaults distorts the public’s perception and reinforces the false notion that rape is a twice-in-a-decade occurrence here. Furthermore, it is very possible that this practice discourages victims of acquaintance rape from coming forward because they have the impression that the crime perpetrated against them is not considered as serious as the stranger rapes which are more frequently reported to outside police departments. For the sake of our security, the administration ought to release information on campus sexual assault.
 Correction
 The September 5, 2012 editorial “Release the Statistics” incorrectly stated that neither the Harvard University Police Department nor  the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response do not release statistics on sexual assaults. This information is available online on HUPD’s website, in accordance with the federal Clery Act. Also, the August 10, 2012 rape in Harvard Yard was reported to the Harvard University Police Department, not the Cambridge Police Department as was stated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of convention season, it has become clear that both parties live in a world that none of us can truly recognize. Columnist James Fallows, a former Crimson editor, claims we live in the “post-truth” age of politics.
While upsetting, it is entirely unsurprising that super PACs blatantly disregarded the facts, since their favored candidates can deny any involvement. Yet the parties and even the presidential and vice-presidential candidates themselves have started to publically lie without regard to our political discourse or society as a whole.
Granted, politicians’ distortion of reality is not a new trend. But the de-regulation of campaign finance, escalation of hyper-partisanship, and insatiable public appetite for inflammatory rhetoric have all contributed to an unprecedented disregard for the truth.
Besides honesty and integrity, the irrelevance of truth has particularly severe implications for public policy debates.
Most statistics professors and frustrated Statistics 104 students will tell you that the interpretation of statistical data is an inherently subjective science. Transformations and reinterpretations can create different results from the same data set.
Statistics thus becomes easy to twist in accordance with individual beliefs. Rather than deriving public policy from numerical facts, we have started to derive public policy from pre-existing ideological arguments.
The proliferation of think tanks, policy organizations, and other quantitative-heavy institutions has given rise to a torrent of new research beholden to a specific ideology. Data simply adhere to an existing political narrative rather than providing objective evaluations.
As a result, hyper-partisanship has flourished at the cost of substantive policy debate. We now have partisan conceptions of reality that differ on their most fundamental assertions about the world.
For example, Representative Paul Ryan has recently declared that Barack Obama has doubled the size of government. In reality, no reliable data metric shows a doubling of government under President Obama, or even an increase of more than 10 percent.
Debate, the basis of American governance, can only occur through fundamental agreements about political realities. To substantively debate healthcare, for example, legislators must agree that there is a need for healthcare. However, all of our recent political debates, from the debt ceiling to healthcare reform, have shown two parties so removed from each other that they do not even appear to be debating the same issues.
In theory, policy differences result from differing beliefs on how the government should address a particular issue. It results from a difference of interpretation rather than a difference of construction. Statistics frame these debates by providing the foundation through which legislators can discuss potential solutions.
Yet, data are no longer neutral. Even impartial offices like the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office have come under fire for these underlying tendencies. Academia, one of the few institutions with a mission that explicitly pursues objective truth, constantly faces criticisms of liberal bias.
These destructive accusations have undermined the credibility of statistics as a tool for public policy. Actual policy implications become lost amidst inflammatory rhetoric and misinformation. The entire purpose of these organizations disappears, and data no longer aid debate.
We have entered the age of post-modernity in American politics. Established truths no longer appear relevant. In the face of new evidence, we plug our ears and start shouting accusations in order to drown out the cognitive dissonance.
In this way, we have entered a world of multiple political realities, fortified by the politicization of statistics. To refocus the political debate and create a functioning government, we must re-align these realities and, in doing so, understand the credibility of contrary data.

President Obama, Congressional leaders, and over one million people have called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies. However, Massachusetts junior Senator Scott Brown was caught on camera in early July declaring that “oil companies do not get subsidies.”
What’s going on? A simple linguistic trick—the word “subsidies” can refer to direct grants alone. Using this definition, Senator Brown is partially correct—most federal support to oil companies is written into the tax code (though some fossil fuel projects receive direct grants through R&D or transportation funds). But this is a pointless distinction—whether one calls them “subsidies” or “tax policy”, the United States government still spends $11 billion each year on tax exemptions and other special financing for oil, gas, and coal (the “fossil fuel” energy sources which cause global warming). The revenue foregone by exempting fossil fuel companies from their fair share of taxes has to be made up somewhere—ultimately, the citizen taxpayer foots the bill.
Federal support of an industry through tax breaks can make sense when assisting the industry advances the public good. However, it is unclear how American lives are bettered by fossil fuel tax exemptions.
Fossil fuel tax giveaway policy is a clear economic loss for consumers. In 2009, economists Stephen P. Brown and Maura Allaire published a study detailing the economic impacts of removing $5.5 billion of the fossil fuel subsidies written into the tax code. They show that the policy decreases energy prices between $2.29 and $6.60 per person each year—but the average taxpayer dishes out $16.13 for this price reduction. In other words, we pay a dollar and only get back 40 cents. Thus, these favoritist tax policies burden the average American consumer with an extra expense rather than providing any relief.
Since the policy is an economic burden to his constituents, Senator Brown must have other motivations for voting to extend fossil fuel tax loopholes. His support can’t arise from concern about his constituents’ health and lives—dangerous fossil fuel pollution leads to high rates of asthma and cancer in local communities, while American lives have already been lost to extreme natural disasters like wildfires, hurricanes and drought exacerbated by climate change. The Senator’s support for fossil fuel tax giveaways can’t be an effort to create jobs and boost the economy out of the recession—economists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst have found that investments in fossil fuel energy create far fewer jobs than equal investments in safe renewable energy, energy efficiency, or mass transit. Senator Brown’s votes to keep up the status quo of federal energy subsidies—with dirty energy sources receiving more than twice as much support as the job-creating safe energy options—are thus votes to keep unemployment high. The Allaire and Brown study found that fossil fuel subsidies have only a “slight” effect on national security. Any positive effects on national security are probably offset by the negative national security effects of increasing political instability from rising food prices due to global warming-induced droughts and natural disasters, a threat so worrisome that the Defense Department considers it  a “prominent military vulnerability.”
From every angle, the policy is a waste of money—so why does Senator Brown continue keep voting to hand out his constituents’ tax dollars to fossil fuel corporations? For nearly half a year now, students from across Massachusetts, myself included, have been attempting to find out. Staff from Senator Brown’s Boston office say that they don’t know the reasoning behind the Senator’s votes. His Washington D.C. office has not responded to us or to the many inquiries sent by the Boston staff on our behalf. The Senator’s impenetrable silence leaves us to search for justification outside the earnest assumption that our elected representatives only strive to act in the public interest.
We don’t have to search far. In return for Senator Brown’s generous gift of our tax dollars, the fossil fuel industry fills his campaign coffers. In the past two years, Senator Brown has received $319,460 directly from the fossil fuel industry, five times as much money as Senator Kerry has taken from fossil fuel companies in the past 13 years.  Senator Brown’s voting record clearly indicates the value of the fossil fuel industry’s investment—votes to gut the Clean Air Act and release industrial toxins into our communities, votes to prevent action on global warming, and, of course, repeated votes to give our money to the fossil fuel companies who finance his campaigns. Clearly, the deadly energy industry doesn’t just destroy our health and communities—they’ve destroyed Senator Brown’s independence as well.
If “he’s for us”, as Senator Brown’s campaign slogan claims, why doesn’t he act for us rather than his donors?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upperclassmen, think back to your first fall at Harvard. Were you excited, nervous, eager to make friends, and willing to chat with all kinds of people? Maybe those of you who are sometimes shy made an extra effort to be friendly. Your entryway was a built-in community, a microcosm of the diverse range of backgrounds and interests in your freshman class. Through study breaks and shared newness, you got to know each other. You weren’t expected to be best friends with your entryway-mates (though some of you were), but you were expected to be friendly neighbors (and most of you were). Then the blocking process happened. For many of you, this was one of your toughest times at Harvard, and you couldn’t wait to move into your house and have it be over.
Now think about sophomore fall. Despite all of the house events—the Sophomore Outing, the Sophomore Dinner—did you approach your classmates in your house with the same open excitement? Perhaps some of you managed to, but for most of you, that “freshman moment” had passed. You were part of a blocking group, you were busy with activities, and it just wasn’t the same. Now, every class in every house is diverse, but when you walk into the dining hall, you likely see blockmates sitting with blockmates. By Commencement, if you have had a conversation with 85 percent of your classmates in your house, you will likely be an exception.
Residential life at Harvard is great. But it could be even better. How? Incoming Harvard freshmen should be assigned to their houses the summer before freshman year. Freshman should still live together in the Yard, eat in Annenberg, and participate in special, freshman-only events, so that they could bond as a class. However, the students assigned to a house—say, Adams—would be Adams freshmen and all live together in one dorm, or one section of a dorm. Adams freshman would play intramurals for Adams, attend Adams events, and have Peer Advising Fellows from Adams. Sophomore year, everyone would move into Adams together. You’d get to room with whomever you liked, but there would be no such thing as blocking.
Why make this change? I’ve spent several years loving house life as a resident tutor here at Harvard. I was also an undergraduate at Yale, where students are members of their colleges when they arrive as freshmen. Having lived in both systems, I want Harvard to make this change because I think it would make Harvard students happier. If you’ve ever brought your laptop to a meal because all of your blockmates were busy, think how nice it would be to walk into dinner and know you’d find a big, long table of classmates you already know. Wouldn’t you be more likely to show up to IMs, study breaks, and house events if you knew you were going to see your old friends from freshman year? Your class spirit would lead to more house spirit. Your house would feel even more like a home.
I’ve been talking to Harvard students about this idea. Of course, not everyone is convinced.
“I like how freshman year was special, and I got to know all the freshmen.” Freshman year would still be special; it’s freshman year! You’d all live in the Yard together, participate in tons of freshman-only events, and eat in Annenberg as a class.
“It’s nice to have a special thing to look forward to sophomore year.” You still would. Moving from the Yard into your house is totally special; you’d just have more friends when you got there.
“But then we wouldn’t get to have Housing Day!” Housing Day is fun—at least for upperclassmen and students who get assigned to a house they wanted to be in. But think how great it would be if, upon driving up to your freshman dorm, you were met by a dozen upperclassmen in Adams t-shirts, ready to haul every box and bag from your parents’ car up to your fifth-floor suite. Being welcomed into a house community from your first moment on campus is worth a dozen Housing Days.
“If you had only to choose roommates from your house, you might not get to live with your best friends.” True. Think, however, about all the different kinds of people in your freshman dorm. If you knew, from the beginning of the year, that you were all in Adams together, don’t you think you could have found a few people you wouldn’t mind living with? Many of you blocked with freshman dorm-mates as it is. Also, there would still be the option to transfer houses.
“Blocking is a tradition!” Traditions change. Remember: Harvard didn’t use to have houses at all, and the system has evolved from bidding, to ordered choice, to randomization. This change would be an enhancement to Harvard’s already wonderful house system, making students’ 4 years here more comfortable, more connected—and, ultimately, happier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A facility responsible for the Harvard Medical School’s laboratory animals has been cited by the United States Department of Agriculture for failing to review exemptions that allowed it to house primates alone.
The new report reveals the findings of a July 31 inspection, which cited the Harvard School for Comparative Medicine for housing the rhesus macaques alone. The Animal Welfare Act, overseen by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service states that primates, as social creatures, should not be housed alone in order to prevent potential harm that could result from the stress of living alone.
The Animal Welfare Act regulations state that dealers, exhibitors ,and research facilities using primates must develop an environment enhancement plan that addresses “ the social needs of nonhuman primates of species known to exist in social groups in nature.”
David Sacks, a spokesperson for the USDA, said that the Harvard School for Comparative Medicine was granted exemptions allowing them to house the rhesus macaques alone.
Paula S. Gladue, a veterinary medical officer inspector, cited the center for failing to review these exemptions every 30 days.
The Harvard Medical School said in a prepared statement that “the Center for Comparative Medicine has revised the system of documentation for social housing.”
This citation follows a string of citations for facilities affiliated with the Harvard Medical School over the past two years. The New England Primate Research Center, in Southborough, Mass. has seen four primates deaths in less than two years.
Most recently, a cotton-top tamarin monkey died of thirst in February as a result of not having a water bottle in its cage. Other incidents at the NEPRC include a primate that died after being overdosed with anesthetics in July 2011. The animal could not be saved after it experienced kidney failure and was later euthanized. In Oct. 2011 a marmoset died after escaping from its cage, being caught, and undergoing an imaging procedure. In June 2010 a primate was found dead after allegedly going through a mechanical cage washer.

Following Harvard’s announcement last week of a large-scale investigation into alleged cheating on a final in an introductory government class, several faculty members who have similarly offered take-home exams say that they are not yet convinced that an end to the practice is merited.
Numerous courses at the College utilize out-of-class finals to test understanding of class material, from Social Studies 40: “Philosophy and Methods of the Social Sciences” to English 157: “The Classic Phase of the Novel.”
And despite last Thursday’s revelation that more than 100 Harvard undergraduates may have plagiarized on a take-home final examination in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” some teaching staff members contend that a take-home exam remains a valuable tool.
“It allows students to synthesize the concepts and to actually use them in ways beyond just regurgitating things they’ve learned in lecture,” said Harvard Kennedy School Professor Timothy Nelson, who gave his students in Sociology 43: “Social Interaction” a take-home final this spring.
This semester, Nelson’s Sociology 155: “Class and Culture” will have both a take-home midterm and final.
In the spring, United States in the World 30: “Thinking about the Constitution,” taught by Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe, also administered a take-home exam.
“We saw no reason to disadvantage people who might not think as quickly but whose understanding is superior,” said Joshua A. Matz, the course’s head teaching fellow. He added that it is still uncertain whether a take-home final will be given when the course is offered again in the spring.
Both Matz and Nelson said that, although they considered the possibility of student cheating, it did not deter them from giving a take-home exam. And at the end of the semester, none of the exams for either class raised issues of academic dishonesty.
But both also admitted that the absence of any suspicious tests does not mean that students did not discuss the prompt amongst themselves.
“I would imagine that it would have been fairly easy for students to cheat in at least some ways, like the sharing of information at a very general level in ways that it would have been impossible to detect,” Matz said.
In fact, Nelson said he even encourages collaboration on take-home finals leading up to the actual process of writing.
“Once you send a question in a take-home, [students] are going to talk about it.  To expect them not to is unrealistic,” he said.
Chad Kia, the professor of Islamic Civilizations 105: “Culture and Society in Contemporary Iran,” said he will continue to give his students the freedom to write their final exam papers outside of class.
“If they collaborate, I don’t consider that plagiarism,” he said. “The nature of the exam or the final paper, it’s that they have to really engage with the text and come up with solutions,” a process he said is often best achieved through discussion.
“The work has to be their own,” he said.
Kia added that the small size of his class--only 32 students took the course last semester--allows him to familiarize himself with student writing and catch plagiarism earlier in the semester.
But he was not overly surprised at the allegations, calling academic dishonesty a “cultural” phenomenon that may be a consequence of high pressure at institutions like Harvard.
“There might be a tendency to think that because these are elite institutions it doesn’t happen,” he said. “But I would argue that of course it happens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students muddling through their first day of shopping period encountered a change when several professors chose to highlight collaboration policies while introducing their courses this Tuesday.
Although professors are required to report course policies on academic dishonesty in their syllabi, students said many of them chose to specifically address their rules regarding collaboration in class this semester, a practice they don’t remember from previous years. This change follows an announcement by Harvard administrators last Thursday that the college is investigating roughly 125 students for illicit collaboration with their classmates on an exam in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
In his class Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 13: “Analyzing Politics,” Government Professor Kenneth A. Shepsle added a statement in his syllabus that specified while “discussion and the exchange of ideas are essential to doing academic work,” students should make sure to work through problems sets on their own and submit only original work for grading.  In a syllabus posted on the course’s iSite earlier this summer, Shepsle had not included a section elaborating specifically on his rules for collaboration.
Several students said they encountered statements like Shepsle’s in class on Tuesday.
In Emma Dench’s heavily shopped class, History 1011: “The World of the Roman Empire,” Dench described in detail her policies on collaboration and addressed the allegations of cheating made last week, according to Maura D. Church ’14.
Dench, a classics and history professor, told students that she would be giving a three-hour final exam rather than a take home exam in order to ensure that all students would be “on the same page,” according to Church.
“It's certainly possible to design appropriate take home exams,” wrote Dench in an email. “But...the traditional, registrar-arranged exams take away a lot of the possible doubt and suspicion.”
History Lecturer Brett Flehinger, who established a newly-created position in the College administration addressing academic integrity on Tuesday, included on his syllabus for History 1434: “American Public Life in the 20th Century” an explicit statement about collaboration, specifying that group study guides were not allowed.
In an email to faculty members on August 30, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith encouraged professors to make sure their policies on collaboration were clearly outlined in syllabi and to discuss these policies with their students in class. Smith also informed faculty that assistance with drafting specific language could be received through the Office of Undergraduate Education.
Smith also encouraged faculty members to discuss the issue of collaboration with each other in order to “foster a culture of honesty and integrity in our classes and learning assessments,” adding that their efforts to do so are “essential to our success.”
According to spokesperson Jeff Neal, the Committee on Academic Integrity is expected to make a set of recommendations to the faculty in order to “reinforce their expectations of academic integrity.”
“While the allegations are limited to one class, we are taking a number of steps to underscore the importance of academic integrity for students even as the Administrative Board’s review continues,” wrote Neal in an email to The Crimson on Tuesday.
“No one really lingered on the point,” said a sophomore about the scandal. “But it was...a common reference point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just days before Harvard announced its most sweeping plagiarism investigation in recent memory, the College tapped Brett Flehinger, resident dean of Lowell House and a lecturer in the history department, to fill a recently-created position in the College administration addressing academic integrity.
Flehinger was hired in mid-August as assistant dean of the College and associate secretary of the Administrative Board, Harvard’s disciplinary body, which is investigating the roughly 125 students accused of academic dishonesty in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
Flehinger, who started his new position on Tuesday, will leave his job in Lowell but will continue in his role in the history department. Flehinger was not available to comment on his new position, but expressed mixed emotions about leaving Lowell in an Aug. 16 email to the House announcing his departure.
“Taking this job is bittersweet, primarily because it means I’ll be stepping down as resident dean, and I want to thank everyone in the House for the past three years,” Flehinger wrote. “Living with all of you has been an enriching, exciting, and heart-warming experience.”
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, said the new position was created before Harvard began its cheating investigation. Neal wrote in an emailed statement that the position was first requested in February and then authorized in late April or early May. Neal did not return a request for comment on whether the cheating scandal fast-tracked the administration’s timeline for filling the job.
In mid- to late-May, assistant professor Matthew B. Platt alerted the Ad Board to suspiciously similar strings of words in between 10 and 20 final take-home exams in his spring course, a tip that led the Ad Board to later expand its investigation to about 125 students in the class.
In an Aug. 15 email to College administrators announcing the appointment, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote that Flehinger would “provide a guiding role” in implementing campus programs addressing academic integrity. She also wrote that Flehinger would work with Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” Ellison to manage Ad Board cases, particularly ones involving academic misconduct.
The University also mentioned the appointment in its Aug. 30 announcement of the cheating investigation, writing that a newly-appointed administrator would focus on “building awareness among faculty and students about Harvard’s academic integrity policies.”
Lowell affiliates say Flehinger is known for his ability to connect and empathize with students, a trait that they say will serve him well in his new role with the Ad Board.
“Brett was very caring, very humorous, very irreverent,” House administrator Beth Terry said. “The student really like him.”
House resident David A. Ahmadi '13 described Flehinger as someone with “a natural ability to communicate with students and make them feel like they’re talking with an administrator who really understands what’s going on.”
House Committee Co-Chair Briana L. Jackucewicz ’13 said she has heard from friends in the House that Flehinger has been a valuable resource in helping them navigate the often stressful Ad Board process.
“I’ve gotten the impression people are extremely comfortable talking with him about those sort of things,” Jackucewicz said. “I know friends have always had positive experiences with Brett when they’re going through difficult situations.”
Flehinger, who was picked as Lowell’s new resident dean in 2009, will be replaced by interim resident dean Caitlin M. Casey, a lecturer in history and literature. Flehinger wrote in his email to the House that he will continue to live in Lowell House for most of the fall.
Before his new appointment, Flehinger had previously been a member of the Ad Board in his role as resident dean. He is also a former preceptor in the Expository Writing program, which teaches freshmen how to avoid plagiarism in their academic research and writing.

A new applied physics class will have neither exams nor lectures. In fact, the students themselves will do most of the actual teaching.
Applied Physics 50: “Physics as a Foundation for Science and Engineering” will serve as a new gateway application-oriented introductory physics class and will debut in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences this fall. It will utilize “Peer Instruction,” an unconventional pedagogical style championing active student learning through interactive team projects that challenge students to apply their learning to real-world problems. For example, instead of speaking in front of the classroom, the professor will guide students as they design Rube-Goldberg machines, unmanned space missions, and musical instruments.
Eric Mazur, course instructor and developer of the unusual teaching method, proposed the idea for the course after receiving rave feedback from students enrolled in his course, Physics 95: “Topics in Current Research.” His hope is to improve the perception of the typical introductory physics course, which “most students would take reluctantly without understanding its purpose or applicability,” he said.
“Why just take notes about blocks sliding down an inclined plane? You’ll probably forget everything as soon as the course is over. Real learning takes place when you learn in context,” Mazur said.
The course was structured to foster the spirit of effective collaboration that the instructors hope to cultivate in students. The course will cover physics at approximately the level of Physics 11a and Physics 11b through three-month-long projects each semester, each relating to an engineering discipline or important field such as energy or the environment.
Moreover, students will display their insights in organized presentations given throughout the semester. Even the course’s location in Pierce 301 lends itself to its unusual teaching style; students will sit at round tables, giving them little choice but to engage with one another.
“We want to emphasize peer instruction and how important it is for students to engage and have meaningful conversations with each other,” said new course preceptor Carolann Koleci.
“No matter what career paths the students take, it is absolutely essential to have an applicable understanding of the world around them and to know how to apply what they’ve learned in one context to that of another,” she added.
Hands-on approaches to pedagogy are being integrated into an increasing number of SEAS courses. SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray stated that the courses play an important role in making the study of math, science, and engineering more engaging for students with a variety of learning styles.
“This fits into SEAS plans for being at the forefront of learning in pedagogy, and then applying the science of learning in our courses,” Murray said.
Instructors hope that the course will appeal to both loyal engineering students and students from other disciplines who want to see how physics applies to the real world. The new learning style has sparked considerable interest and debate amongst students.
Danielle M. Ithier ’15 said that Harvard’s lack of interactive projects for engineers in the past was frustrating for many students.
“I'm glad the school is taking the initiative to change this and is doing it while teaching concepts like introductory physics,” Ithier said.
Students also pointed out that, while the new methods may make courses more relevant and exciting for students, they may have the reverse effect if not implemented correctly.
“If the course is taught badly then students get less of an understanding of both the fundamental physics...as well as how it's applied,” Josh S. Speagle ’15 said.
Applied Physics 50a will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1pm to 4pm in Pierce 301.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a statement to The Crimson, former Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser responded to a report by the Office of Research Integrity published earlier today finding him responsible for six counts of research misconduct, including fabrication of data, doctoring of results, and misrepresentation of research methods.
Although he does not agree with the entirety of the report, Hauser said that he accepts full responsibility for any errors made when he was head of the laboratory—many of which he said he considered a result of his taking on too much responsibility at the University.
“I tried to do too much, teaching courses, running a large lab of students, sitting on several editorial boards, directing the Mind, Brain & Behavior Program at Harvard, conducting multiple research collaborations, and writing for the general public,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson. “I let important details get away from my control, and as head of the lab, I take responsibility for all errors made within the lab, whether or not I was directly involved.”
The two-year federal investigation came to an end today when the Department of Health and Human Services posted its official notice online. According to the report, Hauser’s research misconduct affected work funded by four different national agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Mental Health. Hauser continues to maintain that much of the doubt surrounding his research is unmerited.
“I am saddened that this investigation has caused some to question all of my work, rather than the few papers and unpublished studies in question,” he wrote. “Before, during and after the investigation, many of my lab’s research findings were replicated by independent researchers. I remain proud of the many important papers generated by myself, my collaborators and my students over the years.”
Internal review by Harvard preceded the national investigation by three years. After the Boston Globe announced that Hauser was taking a one-year leave of absence due to a three-year investigation into the integrity of his work, Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith confirmed in Aug. 2010 that a Harvard committee had found Hauser “solely responsible” for eight instances of misconduct.
Since Harvard’s investigation, Hauser retracted or corrected three of the published articles found to be problematic. Today’s ORI report acknowledged these changes but still found the original papers faulty.
Hauser resigned from his tenured position on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in July 2011 after colleagues on the faculty voted to bar him from his teaching duties. In his statement, he called the investigation process “long and painful” and added that he is “relieved” it is finally complete.
“Over the past year, I have blended my passion for teaching, science and humanitarian efforts to give back to those in need, focusing on at-risk youth,” he wrote. “This work is deeply satisfying and I look forward to making new contributions to human welfare, education, and the role of scientific knowledge in understanding human nature.”
Although Hauser “neither admits nor denies committing research misconduct,” according to the ORI report, he has agreed to supervision for any research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service, review of the legitimacy of his data by any institution that employs him in the future, and exclusion from advisory responsibilities the PHS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
With the Olympic games and Senior World Rowing Championships taking place this summer, it may have been easy to lose sight of Harvard’s presence in major American professional sports leagues. In case you missed the thrilling reality show that is the NFL preseason and the MLB’s dog days of summer, we’ve got you covered.
In football action, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 will be under center in his fourth consecutive year with the Buffalo Bills. He has been named the starter for week one as his squad travels face Mark Sanchez and the New York Jets.
But Fitzpatrick was not the only Crimson alum with the opportunity to toss the ball this summer. Third-year recalled reliever Frank Herrmann ’06 saw his first significant time in the majors. In five appearances since August 7, the righty put up a 4.70 ERA and 1.30 WHIP.
The four medals in London paled in comparison to bling awarded to Jeremy Lin ’10 this summer. After an explosive breakout sophomore year, the point guard was signed by the Houston Rockets. Lin’s former Knicks, who were granted early-Bird rights in June failed to match the back-loaded 3-year deal valued at just over 25 million dollars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With little over 20 minutes remaining in regulation, the outcome of the Boston University-Harvard matchup looked like it would fall the way it had in the first round of the 2011 NCAA tournament—in favor of the Terriers.
But thanks to the second goal of the game from senior defender Taryn Kurcz, the Crimson came back and ultimately finished the game in a 2-2 tie Monday night at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
“[Kurcz] was awesome,” said sophomore goalie Bethany Kanten. “She started tonight, and our coach said that he put her in there to cause them trouble because she works harder than anybody. She is never going to give up, she’s going to run 100 percent all the time. It obviously worked really well out for her and for everybody tonight. She was really great.”
The equalizing goal came 67:25 into the contest after a Boston University (3-2-1) foul set up a free kick for junior co-captain Peyton Johnson. Johnson swung the ball from one side of the field to the other, placing it to the left of the box and setting up Kurcz’s 15-yard header.
Neither team scored again for the duration of the second half, sending the match to overtime. And after 20 more minutes of gameplay with no more scores from either side, the final whistle blew signaling Harvard’s (1-0-1) first tie of the season.
Like her first goal, Kurcz’s second come on a set piece. With 4:36 elapsed in the first period and the ball sent out of bounds by a Terrier defender, senior Aisha Price threw in the ball from the left sideline. Kurcz, a Crimson sports executive, placed herself near the right side of the box and headed the ball in for the first score of the game, a near mirror image of the goal later to come.
But Kurcz gave the credit to her teammates, Price and Johnson.
“The [passes] were on point tonight,” Kurcz said. “The first one, from Aisha—her throws are just incredible. It was perfectly placed. The same thing with Peyton. She put it in the perfect spot for me to get it. They gave me the opportunity and pretty much put it on a silver platter for me to finish it.”
The game was tied up 33 minutes later when a Boston University corner kick eventually resulted in a goal for Jenna Fisher. The initial shot sent Crimson goalkeeper Bethany Kanten diving forward, deflecting the ball but rendering her unavailable to save the following attempt, a 15-yard goal by Fisher.
At the 63:23 mark, the Terriers’ momentum continued with its second and final goal of the evening. The play began when Taylor Krebs sent a pass downfield towards teammate Clare Pleuler. Pleuler beat two Harvard players to the ball, dribbled it further down the right sideline, and ultimately ended up netting the ball from 12 yards out.
Boston University outshot the Crimson, 20-18. Of the seven Terrier shots on goal, Kanten stopped five, marking her second straight game with five saves.
“I’ve just gotten a lot more confident. and I’m not scared to play BU anymore,” Kanten said. “Last fall, it was scary because they’re a big-time program and they have a lot of really good players, but now it’s like, ‘Let’s bring it. We’re just as good as they are.’”
And, with the Kurcz goal that came in the 67th minute, Harvard officially put its four-game losing streak against Boston University to bed along with some of its more bitter memories from last year.
“There was a lot of emotion still from last season. We wanted to show them what kind of team we are,” Kanten said. “I think that in our tournament game [last year], we didn’t really show them that we could play, that we could compete, and that we could really challenge them. I think we did that today.”
Kurcz’s sentiments echoed that of her teammates, as she stressed the confidence that the team has going forward.
“We’ve struggled with BU in the past, but we came out with a totally different mentality this time,” Kurcz said. “We know we’re a good team. We just came out confident and just put away our chances. We’re never happy with a tie, but I’m proud of the way the team played.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As classes pick up, so do many of Harvard’s 41 varsity sports, meaning Cambridge will be hosting plenty of contentious matchups worth marking down on your calendar. Here are five that any true fan shouldn't miss.
 Men’s Soccer vs. Michigan State, Sept. 7
The men’s soccer squad (0-1-1) kicks off its home schedule against the Spartans, only the second-ever Big Ten competitor to take on the Crimson. After a disappointing 2-12-3 record last year, Harvard will be looking to avoid the early-season deficit that plagued the 2011 campaign. Michigan State (1-2-1) is coming off a 1-0 loss to nationally ranked UConn but hasn’t lost a game by more than a one-goal margin since October 2010.
Women’s Soccer vs. Boston College, Sept. 15
Coming off of an Ivy-title-winning 2011 season, the Crimson women (1-0-1) will be looking to defend its championship against a strong collection of Ancient Eight opponents, but the team’s non-conference schedule will likely prove just as challenging. After a 2-2 tie with Boston University on Sept. 3, the Crimson will face yet another crosstown foe in BC for the first time in the regular season since 2009. The Eagles are currently ranked No. 7 in the nation with a 4-0-1 overall record.
Football vs. Cornell, Oct. 6
Going into the 2012 season, Harvard garnered 13 of 17 first-place votes and 132 points in the media poll, but the Big Red managed to pick up 100 points, coming in third among Ivy competitors. Cornell will be returning last year’s Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year in junior quarterback Jeff Mathews who passed for a total of 3,412 yards in the Big Red’s 2011 campaign.
Men’s and Women’s Crew at Head of the Charles, Oct. 20-21
The Crimson and Radcliffe crews will take to the Charles in late October for what is perhaps Cambridge’s most iconic sporting event. The two-day regatta brings in boats and rowers from around the world, looking to win on one of their sport’s biggest stages. Last year, the Harvard men’s heavyweights accomplished a landmark win in the championship eights race for just the third time in program history.
Football vs. Yale, Nov. 17
The Game is hardly a surprise to make this list, but with the Crimson ranked in the top 25 of several national preseason polls and heavily favored to defend its Ivy title, Harvard may dominate the long-standing rivalry’s 129th installment. Last year’s 45-7 victory capped off the Crimson’s undefeated Ivy run, and this year’s matchup may have the same potential as long as Harvard can get past tough Cornell and Penn squads in the weeks before.
