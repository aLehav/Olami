“Imperial is infinite,” writes William Vollmann. And because saying it once could not possibly capture what he could mean, what he profoundly, obsessively believes, Vollmann writes it again and again—sometimes in those exact words, sometimes in others—over the 1,344-page opus that is his latest book. Imperial, the book’s titular county, is at the very southern tip of California—though its presence is so immeasurable that Vollmann spends several sections trying to define what his Imperial actually encompasses. Vollmann produces a work similar in many ways to his subject: vast, intimidating, confusing to navigate, at times dry as its deserts, but at others lush as its valleys.
Even the length of the book affirms Vollmann’s devotion to his topic. In 2000, his second year researching for “Imperial,” he was already determined “to return year after year, deepening friendships, exploring sandscapes and ruthlessly studying people’s lives until Imperial became as shockingly bright in my mind as the bands of sunny grass between the aisles of a palm-orchard.” For the next eight years, Vollmann completed “Imperial” doing precisely that. His interests are equally topological and sociological: returns to Imperial not just to research the exact condition of the New River, but to talk to the sad-looking prostitutes one is bound to find along the border as well.
Thus, “Imperial” is a work of journalism, but only in the same way that Imperial is simply a county in California. Vollmann provides graphs and charts and diagrams and maps alongside an exhaustively-researched history. The citation section of “Imperial” spans 200 pages alone. The book is also filled with painstaking interviews with residents, officers, illegal aliens, strippers, “cayotes” (men hired to smuggle immigrants into the country illegally)—in short, everyone who is willing for $10 or less.
Despite the initial semblance of journalistic reportage, the investigation that gives “Imperial” its structure is far from objective. Vollmann indicates he had first visited Imperial with a lover. “Until a week ago this place had been hers and mine, our place,” he writes, “in those days Imperial was as beautiful as a double rainbow over the desert, rain falling and evaporating as it fell when we came down Highway 78 into Ocotillo.” He characterizes his quest as one to understand Imperial as a place divorced from his own personal memories. Somehow this absurd explanation for the origins of “Imperial” seems absolutely credible coming from Vollmann, whose previous works reveal, if nothing else, a man easily obsessed. A sentimentality colors the prose of Vollmann’s work at large in a way that would make calling “Imperial” purely non-fiction reductive. Even his decision to leave out quotations in favor of fluid movement from description to speech gives it the affect of raw consciousness, as if heard in a dream. “Crossing the river into California, giving down on the reservation’s wide green and yellow bottomlands, I received this greeting: WELCOME TO PARADISE CASINO. I don’t know if you’ll find anybody who wants to talk, said the girl at the convenience store. How about you? Nope.”
Vollmann also fully indulges an impulse to make himself the frame for his book. Just as much as “Imperial is America,” as he writes, “Imperial” is William Vollmann. He devotes large parts of the book to his favorite prostitutes and strippers, and one particularly memorable but puzzling chapter to the break up with his girlfriend. Other chapters are written from the perspective of a Mexican farmer, and others still are collections of quotes from previous pages.
Not that his focus could ever be questioned. Vollmann toils under the hot Imperial sun and sails through polluted and abandoned rivers, risking dehydration and disease. “I was worried about two possibilities,” he writes. “The first and more likely but less immediately detrimental one was that we might get poisoned by the New River... The second peril, which seriously concerned me, was dehydration.” In spite of such ubiquitous danger, Vollmann’s devotion is unflagging; “Imperial” is a work that leaves little to the imagination, and Vollmann literally leaves no stone unturned. His obsession both drives the book and sidetracks it. One chapter includes listings from the county directory of names and their corresponding occupations. In another, he describes a lingerie store and muses on its possible place in a speculative Guide Book to Imperial. His historical account of Imperial is equally thorough; “What were the Chinese up to in Mexicali? I promise that it will take me less than a hundred pages to tell you.” Then he proceeds to devote a ninety-page tangent to precisely that tidbit of history.
There is something strangely poetic about “Imperial.” The passion with which Vollmann overflows for his subject infects the (patient) reader. The seventh reiteration of some Imperial resident’s saying “I can’t help believing in people” is infinitely more touching than the sixth. “The Desert Disappears. Water is Here”—which originally appeared in a headline of a newspaper from which Vollmann quotes—is more heartbreakingly ironic and more beautiful for its rhythmic prose each time it is repeated.
It seems the best way to approach “Imperial” is precisely the way Vollmann approached Imperial. Its disjointed structure is a service to the sheer volume of time it takes to finish the book. After a decade of research, in a 1,300-page book, Vollmann is still doubtful that he has really covered the entirety of Imperial. He often defends himself by claiming that Imperial is ultimately “unknowable.” And “Imperial,” too, teems with such limitless detail that no reader could possibly absorb it all.
But Imperial is also “whatever you want it to be.” Vollmann goes further: “books are whatever we want them to be.” It seems to be an open invitation to take what you will and leave the rest for another time. It is this freedom that renders “Imperial” at once a deeply personal and deeply resonant labor. “I am where I want to be, in Paradise. Let me now commence the history of Paradise.”

“At least there is at hand a testament—this first novel ‘V’—which suggests that no matter what his circumstances, or where he’s doing it, there is at work a young writer of staggering promise.”So began the literary career of Thomas Pynchon, whose latest novel, “Inherent Vice,” we gather here today to celebrate. Since George A. Plimpton ’50 wrote the above praise some 46 years ago, Pynchon has indeed succeeded in turning staggering promise into staggering achievement. His third novel, 1973’s “Gravity’s Rainbow,” is one of those works—like Joyce’s “Ulysses” or Wallace’s “Infinite Jest”—that literary junkies force themselves to read and pray that they’ll one day understand. He has received a National Book Award (for that novel), a MacArthur “genius grant,” and is consistently on the rumored short list for the Nobel Prize in Literature.All of this perhaps explains why the critical response to “Inherent Vice,” released earlier this summer, has been long on career retrospection and short on evaluation. So let me say it now: “Inherent Vice” is not a very good novel. It’s not engaging. It’s not inventive. It’s not intricate, and it’s not precise. What it is, though, is an opportunity to examine the stately decline of one of literature’s most enigmatic and gigantic figures.“Inherent Vice” is a typically Pynchonian take on the detective genre, starring Larry “Doc” Sportello as a sandal-wearing, beach-dwelling, pot-smoking Private Eye. The paranoiac narrative—situated historically around the 1970 Manson Family murder trial and geographically around the fictional Gordita Beach on the California coast—begins when an old flame named Shasta Fay approaches Doc with a vaguely defined mission: to protect her current boyfriend, real-estate heavyweight Mickey Wolfmann, from the shadowy forces trying to put him on ice.And then she disappears. In the process of trying to find Shasta—and Mickey, who disappears simultaneously, but separately—Doc winds up entangled with an undead saxophonist, a contract killer, several drug dealers, and a dentist, all somehow connected to a sinister outfit called the “Golden Fang.”For a primer to help you decode what seems convoluted in “Inherent Vice,” look to Pynchon’s second novel, “The Crying of Lot 49,” an altogether more effective version of the same basic literary ideas. That novel is also a paranoia-infused narrative set in California, in which an (amateur) private investigator (“Oedipa Maas”) is on the trail of another sinister outfit (“W.A.S.T.E”), a trail that leads her to just as many interesting characters and down trippy narrative side streets, with names even fruitier than the characters in “Inherent Vice” (“Pierce Inverarity,” “Randy Driblette,” “Genghis Cohen”). It’s also half the number of pages.In ways both formal and thematic, “Inherent Vice” is a Pynchon nostalgia trip, one more journey to the author’s literary roots. It’s interesting to watch a man of such genius walk back over familiar ground, this time with the beneficial wisdom but the consequential loss of stamina that come when a great writer ages. In his review for the “New York Review of Books,” Michael Wood classed the book as “a shaggy detective story parodied by Thomas Pynchon, or perhaps like a moderately baggy Thomas Pynchon novel parodied by a devotee of the detective story.”“Inherent Vice” lacks the energy and inspiration that propelled “The Crying of Lot 49” to become a twentieth century classic. It might have turned a cheap noir pastiche in lesser hands, the work of a writer resting on his laurels or trying to pick up a check. But given the extent to which the detective genre informs novels like “V.,” “The Crying of Lot 49,” and “Gravity’s Rainbow,” and the somehow hypnotic quality of even the book’s mangiest sections, it’s clear that Pynchon retains a deep affection for the genre even now. Similarly, his novels have always dabbled heavily in references to the pulp novel’s cultural siblings—rock music and monster movies—so, despite the seeming retreat into genre fiction, he maintains a continuity of style, if his substantive fingerprints are still conspicuously absent.Unfortunately, the rigid pacing and logical arc of the conventional detective story don’t quite jive with Pynchon’s classic (one might say, inherent) psychedelia. The novel really does feel shaggy and baggy, because the normally lean detective genre has had to loosen up to accommodate Pynchon’s wild narrative loops and quixotic scenic fancies. When the dentist’s secretary pauses a plot-advancing conversation to ask Doc’s friend—“Excuse me, . . . is that a slice of pizza on your hat?” —the irksomeness of the interruption overshadows the humor of his response (“Oh wow, thanks man, I’ve been lookin [sic] all over for that…”)Some of the author’s old tricks still dazzle though, as when Doc buys “Wyatt Earp’s personal mustache cup” from a man in Las Vegas whose name turns out to be a “byword of fraudulent Earpiana.” But it turns out to be authentic against all the odds—excessive faith is, after all, the flipside of paranoia.Perhaps with all his Nazis, conspiracies, and marijuana, Pynchon is actually a creature of excessive faith. Following the clues in a 40-plus-year literary career leads one to the idea that Pynchon will keep on producing, slowly and steadily, until he just keels over. Although he fulfilled the promise Plimpton saw many years and more pages ago, “Inherent Vice” demonstrates that Pynchon is always willing to go back to the well, with the faith that there will still be something there.—Staff writer Jillian J. Goodman can be reached at jjgoodm@fas.harvard.edu.

Whether “Azorno” is a novelesque prose poem, or a poetic novel written in prose is up for debate—as is much of the nature of its contents. A hall of mirrors, the book was written by acclaimed Danish poet Inger Christensen, who died in early January of this year at 73. Denise Newman’s translation of “Azorno,” released in January, marked the first time since its publication in the late 1960s that the novel has been available in English, and while the book’s experimental nature makes its absence rather unsurprising, the arrival of its 105 pages is long overdue.To crystallize the plot of “Azorno” is to reduce the atmosphere that makes it beautiful and in which its quavering logic (and, in turns, illogic) dwells. Who does what is beside the point. The book’s central drama is also its opening one. It is the question of which woman meets Azorno on page eight, page eight being that of the mysterious novel within the novel ostensibly. The eponymous Azorno is cited as the protagonist of Sampel’s book, yet Sampel is also called Azorno, both by himself and by the women who may or may not surround him in reality—whatever reality may be. Incidentally, no such encounter can be found on page eight of this book, though it does play out on many others, recurring in different guises and gardens as one of the novel’s central tropes. And it is this drama’s—the question’s—unresolved nature that is most easily illustrative of its beauty.The novel’s kaleidoscope of females—Xenia, Louise, Randi, Katarina, Bathsheba—all write novels or letters, but beyond existing on the page to the reader at hand (which is to say Christensen’s) they are themselves written by one another in turn, defined as characters within each others’ dramas. And throughout the text—or perhaps texts—author and creation become blurred beyond distinction. Christensen’s book collapses the so-called fact and fiction that separate the characters’ interior and exterior spaces. Like Sampel and Azorno, the five women—four of them claiming to be lovers of the author/protagonist and one of them his wife—are not quite interchangeable. Each possesses her own subtleties of speech, and yet they are constantly interchanged. They call for one another, assume each others’ names, and send each other off on rescue missions that feel more like sabotage. All the while the book’s metafictional mystery of the woman on page eight plays out amidst murders and pregnancies that, truth be told, do not actually exist. As Randi narrates in an aside midway through the novel, “By the way, I don’t think Katarina was even trying to get close to the truth, if once again, just for a moment, I consider the truth to be the actual circumstances.” The “truth” and “actual circumstances” only coincide for mere moments: it is the rest of the time that we are concerned with. When Randi relays Katarina’s story a few lines later “etc., etc., etc.” replaces the version of events. What is relayed are Katarina’s emotional and physical demands—and the accusation that Louise is caught in a daydream.It is the reader most of all who feels caught in a daydream, shuffled between the novel’s ever-changing “I”s and shifting versions of events. Goethe is a smiling dog who eats sandwiches. Goethe is porcelain statue. A suitcase is packed by Randi. A suitcase, topped with the woman on page eight’s ubiquitous white hat is packed by Bet. And by Sampel. These recursive moments extend throughout the book, resonating with the more formal structure of poetry or music, which so often relies on reiteration and redoubling. The lyricism of the text is ever present, and Christensen’s prowess as an experimental poet, known for her groundbreaking works in verse—in particular “It,” “Alphabet,” and “Butterfly Valley: A Requiem,” all of which have been translated into English in recent years—cannot be forgotten when reading her prose. The emphasis on cadence and the special weight of each word that appears in novels written by poets such as this pose quite a challenge to any translator, particularly one attempting to shift the paradoxically melodious and halting prosody of Danish into English. In many ways, its no wonder “Azorno” has gone untranslated for so many decades—I only wish I knew what transformations the Danish words underwent in the original, and how Newman’s version compares. Christensen is constantly playing with language puzzles, and it is Newman’s task to maintain this play with an entirely different set of pieces. A paragraph might break down into a single sentence, which is then distilled to a word; “explain” is deconstructed to “plain” then to “in,” which in turn begins a new phrase.However, it must be said that Newman’s version does contain the odd off word, small moments here and there that stick out of sentences. These words are most often slightly more colloquial than seems appropriate, alerting the reader to the text’s transmutation. However, far more tangible are the marvelous moments in which Newman’s work succeeds, conveying in prose both vivid and dreamy the physiognomy of botanicals, the silence beneath seas, and the sounds of fountains whose tones vary slightly from that of rain. It is rare for a text to be lovely, lilting, and dealing in love, without ever lapsing into the saccharine. “Azorno” is hard to pick up and put down—not simply because the maze is hard to enter again until it has already been read through once and returned to, but because you simply may not want to leave its swirling eddies of worlds. The novel could be accused of slightness, and in many ways it does feel like a beautiful exercise more than it does a finished masterwork. But despite its small spine and recursive nature, “Azorno” contains multitudes, and it is to the novel’s credit that it asks more questions than it ever answers. Just whose daydream this is we never know for sure, but at Christensen and Newman’s combined best it feels like our own.—Staff writer Anna K. Barnet can be reached at abarnet@fas.harvard.edu.

At the start of “My One and Only,” Anne Devereaux (Renée Zellweger) comes home to her Manhattan apartment to find her husband in bed with another woman. But she doesn’t cry, or raise her voice, or even register the slightest shock. Instead, she picks up the other woman’s clothing from the ground and helps her get dressed. Minutes later she has purchased a Cadillac and is on her way to Boston with her two sons to rediscover love and, along the way, something of herself.It doesn’t take long for Anne Devereaux to realize that the dating landscape has changed since her 20s. Visiting a series of old flames, she finds that men who once pursued her have directed their attentions elsewhere; they’re married, interested in younger women, or even psychotic. Though her idealism wanes slightly with every bad man she encounters, she holds on to her original optimism, constantly reminding her sons that “things will always work out in the end.”The plot involves numerous commonplace elements—a cheating spouse, a soul-searching roadtrip, a quest for love, a mid-life crisis. Even the setting evokes a certain familiarity: 1950s romanticism, a jazz soundtrack, pastel cardigans, and a preponderance of dinner parties. But surprisingly, the film transcends the clichés it employs by the grace of excellent acting and surprising directorial choices. Renée Zellweger makes a convincing heroine. At 40, she has proven she can play a wide range of roles, yet she always infuses her characters with personal idiosyncrasies. Much like Meryl Streep, Zellweger is never unrecognizable; she carries certain gestures and habits from movie to movie. She purses her lips while crying; the outer edges of her eyebrows elevate when she smiles; she speaks slowly and almost reluctantly. After nearly two decades of these mannerisms, she could be accused of simply mimicking herself role after role, but this is never the case. Rather, Zellweger doesn’t need any radical physical transformation to inhabit her roles. British director Richard Loncraine—who previously directed film adaptations of Shakespeare and a made for TV movie about Winston Churchill—allows Zellweger to flourish in a quieter, more formal movie than she is accustomed to. His prior academic studies of sculpture seem influential in his directorial style; every shot of his is remarkably crafted. His frames are horizontal and narrow; the top of each seems to barely avoid truncating the upper limits of the scene, creating a kind of uncomfortable intimacy for the viewer. The camera shots are still and never shift focus from the characters, allowing the viewer to take in the precise symmetry of the scenes and precluding any sense of detachment. Bricks, fences, and roads often form patterns of strong lines behind the actors, but this never seems forced. The only drawback to his directorial affectation is that it’s, inevitably, just that. While the scenes are always artfully composed, some diversity in filming might shift the focus from directorial sleight to more engaging storytelling.The movie suffers at times from other shortcomings, but they aren’t significant enough to displace its much more noticeable successes. Devereaux’s sons—George, who narrates the film, and Robbie—are underdeveloped as characters. They toss out stock adolescent protests like “You don’t even know me” from time to time, but their main role is on their mother’s coattails. The plot itself is supposed to be at least loosely based on the childhood of perennially bronzed Hollywood has-been George Hamilton, but this could easily escape the average viewer’s notice. These blemishes are also negligible, as the movie truly belongs to Zellweger and to her odyssey. Like most American sojourns, the characters end up in Los Angeles, west of where they started. Their experience has been distinctly bittersweet, and the accomplishment of their goals ambiguous. “My One and Only” may be a variation on many common Hollywood tales, but its conclusion strays from the pack, ushering in heartfelt contemplation rather than oversimplified resolution.

Just as a stereotypical sorority girl dons dyed hair, acrylic nails, and a two-faced personality, “Sorority Row” masquerades as a thriller—shoddily. The film clings so tightly to the bottom tier of mediocrity that most of it can’t even be laughed at. It’s as though the movie strives to be a slasher film for people who don’t like scary movies or, perhaps, for prepubescent boys; there’s more nudity and outrageous partying than violence and suspense.Like most horror movies, “Sorority Row” centers on a series of almost implausibly poor decisions. But in addition to exercising bad judgment after danger presents itself, the sisters of Theta Pi are entirely responsible for their own misfortune. They decide to play a ridiculous prank on an ex-boyfriend that seems almost doomed to end badly. The particulars are inconsequential, but suffice it to say their master plan involves fake roofies and a staged death. When their arrangements take a nasty turn, the sisters decide to dispose of the body in a well mere miles away. Naturally someone discovers their secret and embarks on a massacre during one long day of partying. Of course, this being a sorority movie, the characters do not only make poor choices; they make them while wearing very little clothing. Director Stewart Hendler seems to have been confused by his mission to remake the 1983 cult classic “The House on Sorority Row.” Murders in his movie last 10 seconds each, acting as commercial interruptions in what appears to be a TRL spring break special with copious amounts of foam, alcohol, and cleavage. Reducing the movie to adolescent fantasy prevents it from becoming even remotely frightening.Most of the acting is wholly unconvincing, but some performances were at least fun to watch. There is something strangely amusing about watching reality-TV star Audrina Patridge as the first victim of the sorority girls’ stupidity. “The Hills” revealed Patridge as an aspiring actress; arguably her one-line role in “Sorority Row” is not a great step toward achieving that goal. In another all-too-brief appearance, Carrie Fisher manages to imbue her role as Theta Pi housemother with Princess Leia-like badassery.Most disappointing is Rumer Willis (daughter of Bruce and Demi), who essentially reprises her role as the nerdy, slightly excluded co-ed she played in “The House Bunny”—a sorority film just as horrifying as this one. Like many of the film’s actresses, Willis seems incapable of portraying genuine emotion of any kind, be it fear, bravery, or anxiety.The sorority girls’ dialogue seems rather uncharacteristic of “best friends” but serves at least to break up the painful cycle of party scene to death scene and back to party scene. Insults like “You make being a bitch an art form” aren’t making it into the lexicon anytime soon, though certain occasions might call for them.The males are even less realistic. “Sorority Row” completely slanders men by portraying them as one of three types: one, psychotic and suicidal; two, so stressed that they lose touch with reality; third, arrogant and childish enough to kick the sorority sisters around like footballs. Lesson learned: they all end up dead, maybe. The most egregious sin is the movie’s total lack of suspense. Imminent danger is signaled by the scraping of the murderer’s weapon (a tire iron) against a wall. Suspenseful music, by contrast, delivers no thrilling action, and thus becomes such a frustrating aspect of the movie that by the end there is no uncertainty—however fleeting—of what comes next.Both “Sorority Row” and Theta Pi eventually go down in flames. In the theatre, the film’s end produced an astounding round of applause, either for the film being over or for the meekest character making the first intelligent move of the story. Ultimately, the possibility of a sequel—as suggested by the ambiguous final scene—may be the scariest part of all.—Staff writer Brianne Corcoran can be reached at corcoran@fas.harvard.edu.

Remember the fake nose that Matt Damon wore in “Ocean’s Thirteen”? The 30 extra pounds he sports in Steven Soderbergh’s latest movie, “The Informant!” provide a fuller transformation, albeit a less flattering one. The movie itself is also more substantial than “Ocean’s Thirteen,” but despite a promising setup and a solid cast, the humor in “The Informant!” wears thin before long.The film is based on the true story of Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), an executive at the Archer Daniels-Midland agricultural company who worked as an informant for the FBI in the early 90s. At the movie’s start, Whitacre seems to be a simple biotechnology worker appalled at the corruption in the company’s business practices. It is out of the goodness of his heart, or so he claims, that he volunteers to inform on ADM’s price fixing agreements. As a spy, Mark Whitacre is nothing like Jason Bourne. Matt Damon is almost unrecognizable beneath his round face, thick glasses, toupee, and moustache. He easily charms us with his stutter, awkwardness, and apparent good nature, even as he utters one bold-faced lie after another. Damon adeptly tricks us into trusting his character, despite mounting evidence that we should not.The audience is privy to nearly all of Whitacre’s thoughts as he bumbles through his double life. His stream-of-consciousness voiceovers begin as the most amusing moments of the film. Even while holding conversations with his colleagues at ADM and the FBI, Whitacre contemplates tie patterns, butterfly adaptations, and the hunting techniques of polar bears. His nonsensical musings quickly reveal his atypical understanding of everyday interactions. During his first one-on-one meeting with his FBI handler, we hear him contemplate a potential friendship with the agent: “I could see us fishing, or whatever.”With a keen attention to detail, Soderbergh sets a fittingly rich background for Whitacre’s frenetic imagination. His frequent close ups-of black and green screen computers and clunky recording devices serve as fond reminders of early 90s technology. Even Whitacre’s paranoid fantasies are very much a product of his decade; at one point he compares his own situation to that of Tom Cruise in “The Firm,” which opened in 1993. In nearly every scene, the screen is bathed in brown and yellow tints, adding to the warm, nostalgic feel of the movie.Unfortunately, the comedy of Whitacre’s free association wears off over the course of the film. As it becomes apparent that Whitacre is leading more than one kind of double life, the movie’s unvarying cheerful tone begins to feel increasingly grating. The same upbeat, repetitive music that accompanies Whitacre’s first jaunty walk into his office also plays when the FBI conducts a raid on ADM. This overwhelming cheer stems from the narration, which is almost entirely from Whitacre’s delusional point of view. The narration also renders the supporting characters rather flat. From the moment her husband gets involved with the FBI, Whitacre’s anxious wife (Melanie Lynskey) urges him to come clean: “Whatever you do, Corky, no matter what’s going on, just be honest with them and tell the truth.” But the audience forgets her presence in the film almost as easily as Whitacre forgets her advice. His wheedling coworkers suffer a similar fate; it’s only really possible to differentiate the other executives at ADM by their horrible ties. Most tragically, the comedic gifts of Toby Hale—known best for his role as Buster Bluth in “Arrested Development”—are squandered during his brief appearance as Whitacre’s lawyer.Near the end of the movie, as Whitacre’s plans are beginning to unravel, he notices a swarm of ants feasting on discarded food crumbs. “That’s a big break right there,” he thinks to himself, seemingly envious of their unique position. “There are no choices to be made,” he continues. “You’re an ant, you just eat it.” Whitacre’s own motivations don’t seem so different. Every time he sees an opportunity for self-gain, he takes it without hesitation. Needless to say, such an approach to life works less well for humans than it does for ants. As Whitacre’s life spins towards disaster, his false cheer and bizarre jokes don’t stop, but as we watch him stutter, bluster, and lie his way through meeting after meeting, it’s difficult to keep laughing.—Staff writer Rachel A.

As an up-and-coming self-help author in “Love Happens,” Dr. Burke Ryan encounters many unorthodox ways of dealing with grief. A woman bakes her late husband’s favorite oatmeal raisin cookies garnished with his ashes. Another makes a mold of her dead husband’s penis. Unfortunately, these moments of humor in the midst of tragedy are set against a backdrop of an utterly predictable romance. “Love Happens” traces a hackneyed storyline—complete with dramatic slow-clap in the final scene—but ultimately entertains thanks to the strength of its dead-on humor (literally). While the title was clearly meant to attract a lighthearted crowd in search of a happy ending and a few laughs along the way, the main character’s struggle to overcome his own grief emerges as the central, and most compelling, narrative.The film opens as Burke arrives in Seattle to lead a grief seminar. He is on the brink of a huge multimedia deal with Unicom, an entertainment conglomerate that wants to promote him as the next Dr. Phil. But his penchant for solitary shots of Grey Goose quickly reveals that he has yet to confront the issues through which he guides his audiences. His wife’s death in a car accident three years before continues to haunt him.In his hotel, Burke literally runs into Eloise Chandler (Jennifer Aniston), a beautiful florist with an odd habit of writing obscure words on walls. As their relationship progresses, it becomes increasingly apparent that Eloise, despite her own destructive tendencies (falling for men she knows will love her and leave her), may be the only one capable of pushing Burke to deal with his past.Yet the film establishes Eloise as more of a friend that Burke needs to look out for him than a love interest who completes him. Their chemistry suggests a strong camaraderie rather than a burning passion, and their romance seems tacked on in the eleventh hour. By pushing Eloise out of her friend role, the movie abandons its thoughtful exploration of coping with tragedy in favor of a generic boy-meets-girl setup.Much more interesting than this tired romance is the story of a man who helps others deal with loss while staunchly refusing to even begin dealing with his own. Burke hasn’t even spoken to his in-laws since their daughter’s death. Watching Burke help the struggling Walter (John Carroll Lynch), a contractor whose young son died at his construction site, is particularly moving because of the fine balance Walter strikes between tough-guy pig-headedness and desperate vulnerability. 	Given the subject matter, it is somewhat surprising that the movie shows a knack for perfectly timed humor. Some of Eckhart’s best scenes involve him stealing his old pet parrot from his in-laws and then imitating the movements of the bird in order to inspire it to fly away free. In another scene, Unicom’s advertising executives pitch a weight loss powder that promises to be “finally a loss you can feel good about.” And Judy Greer is fantastic in her small supporting role as Eloise’s feminist, slam-poetry writing employee and friend; when we first meet her, she is reciting graphic poetry to a shocked elderly woman buying flowers. While Eckhart is not quite so striking in his portrayal of Burke as he was as Two-Face in “The Dark Knight,” he is convincing as the outwardly charming, inwardly troubled hero. And though she doesn’t stretch too far from her other recent romantic roles in “He’s Just Not That Into You” and “The Break Up,” Aniston is genuinely funny as Eloise. Ultimately, the weakness of the movie is exemplified by the misleading title; Burke and Eloise never approach a plane where saying “I love you” would seem natural. The romance of “Love Happens” seems out of place, even inappropriate, in the midst of an otherwise clever and touching examination of sorrow and hope.—Staff writer Anna E.

With her fourth studio album, “Mi Plan,” Nelly Furtado shifts her focus wholly onto the Latin genre. Although she’s had several Spanish-language singles and has collaborated with famous Spanish-speaking artists, this will be her first album recorded entirely in Spanish. After delving into hip-hop and R&B with her 2003 album “Loose,” Furtado returns to pop with varying Latin styles, creating a record of intoxicating melodies.With her breakout hit “I’m Like a Bird,” off 2000’s Grammy-winning “Whoa, Nelly!,” Furtado likely could have developed her career solely around her vocal talent and pop style. But in 2003, Furtado chose to abandon pop in favor of less radio-friendly folk music on the tepidly received “Folklore.” For her next album, she tried another route, that of the R&B singer. Collaborating with Timbaland for a series of hip-hop tracks, including the chart-topping “Promiscuous,” Furtado regained star status. Nelly Furtado had recorded Spanish-language music previously—on 2006’s “Te Busque” as well as 2003’s “Fotografia,” a singles duet with famous Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes—but her new album has steeped her even deeper into the Latin genre. “Mi Plan” features cameos from some of the Latin pop world’s best known icons. The album hearkens back to Furtado’s pop roots while simultaneously pushing her in an adventurous new direction. “Mi Plan” is a mixture of upbeat pop and some softer acoustic songs which make a somewhat odd, yet surprisingly workable mix. Guest artists—including Latin icons Alejandro Fernandez, Alex Cuba, Julieta Venegas, La Mala Rodriguez, as well as American singer Josh Groban—bring a refreshing variety to the songs they share with Furtado. Alejandro Fernandez, in the song “Sueños,” nicely complements Furtado’s soaring melody with his deep and bold voice.Elsewhere, Mexican singer-songwriter Julieta Venegas and Spanish hip-hop artist La Mala Rodriguez support Furtado in “Bajo Otra Luz,” trading rapid-fire verses until the emergence of the song’s horn-filled chorus. On one of the album’s emotional peaks, tenor Josh Groban brings his beautiful voice to “Silencio,” in which he and Furtado reflect on suffering in the absence of a lover. While the quantity and stature of Furtado’s guests is exciting, the participation of some contributors is unimpressive. On “Como Lluvia,” Juan Luis Guerra, the infamous Dominican singer/songwriter, is barely audible, to the point where its difficult to discern the identity of the second singer. A soft melodic song with a mixture of acoustic undertones, “Como Lluvia” could have allowed Guerra to showcase his sincere vocal qualities. But despite his distinctive voice, he barely makes any musical contribution to the song. Regardless of this circumstance, likely the fault of the producer, the song deserves praise for its poetic lyrics. “Y me despierto con el concierto de tu cabello en el mio, y un sin fin de un ‘te quiero’,” sings Furtado, which translates to “and I awake with a concert of your hair in mine and with an endless ‘I love you’.” Furtado’s experimentation with a complete Spanish album might make some of her faithful listeners hesitant, but overall the album proves to be a success. She mixes a wide variety of styles, from melancholic ballads to confident pop, and puts meaningful lyrics to them that will not disappoint. Even though most American fans may not understand her words, “Mi Plan” is still a successful comeback into the musical style with which she initially started her career.

Most people only know Kid Cudi, born Scott Mescudi, as the “‘Day ‘n’ Nite’ guy,” after his 2008 surprise hit that rocketed the then-unknown artist to dance floor notoriety. Recognized by the few familiar with the artist as “Dat Kid from Cleveland,” Kid Cudi has been amassing a small following over the past few years, releasing mixtapes and appearing on—as well as contributing songwriting to—Kanye West’s “808s and Heartbreak.” With a talent for balancing the serious and the laughable, Kid Cudi sings and raps about not only the universal experience of heartbreak and regret, but also about the joys of getting really stoned and playing video games. His newest release and first full album, titled “Man on the Moon: The End of Day,” showcases this lyrical diversity as well as his impressive flow. Cudi’s voice is beautiful and his words meaningful; he can spit just as well as he sings. For a new artist attempting an ambitious mixture of styles, Kid Cudi’s album is an impressive success.Immediately noticeable is Cudi’s close attention to detail, not only sonically but also in the album’s presentation. Calling his liner notes a “scene listing” rather than a track list, he groups songs into five acts: “The End of Day,” “Rise of the Night Terror,” “Taking a Trip,” “Stuck,” and “A New Beginning.” While a specific story is difficult to pinpoint, important themes become apparent: feeling misunderstood, staying true to oneself, and getting high. Of course, these ideas are not new to rap, but Kid Cudi’s strength lies in his impressive ability to extend these ideas beyond hip-hop into a variety of genre hybrids, vehicles that provide his lyrics uncommon accessibility.At the heart of Cudi’s musical diversity is his hand-picked mix of guest artists, which include big-name rappers Kanye West and Common, dance-rock bands Ratatat and MGMT, and relative unknowns like rapper Chip Tha Ripper and singer Billy Cravens. The album’s collaborative highlight is “Alive,” featuring Ratatat. An exquisitely executed marriage of hip-hop and techno, it combines Ratatat’s effortlessly cool beats with eerie lyrics: “There’s something going wrong with me / I am changing rapidly / I’m feeling stronger, more alert / I’m on the move / I smell her scent / and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon….” One of the album’s darkest tracks, Cudi’s haunting lyrics are perfectly complemented by Ratatat’s space-age sound.“Make Her Say”—featuring Kanye West, Common, and humorously placed samples from Lady GaGa’s “Poker Face”—is another standout collaboration, albeit a bit more off-color: “So, that explain why I love college / Gettin’ brain in the library ‘cause I love knowledge / When you use your medulla oblongata / And give me scoliosis until I comatoses / And do it while I sleep, yeah, a little osmosis.” Later, on “Simple As…,” Cudi continues his streak of sophomoric yet witty quips—“Simple as dat for your simple ass,” he recites with emphasis on “as” and “ass”—giving the song a lighthearted quality matched by its jingling melody. While many tracks have a serious, creepy, or downright melancholic feel, Cudi offsets the dismal mood they create with clever, playful elements.While Cudi’s consistency is admirable and his missteps are few, some tracks are notably weaker than others. While “Pursuit of Happiness” is imaginatively crafted, again featuring Ratatat as well as fellow neo-psychodelic rockers MGMT, Cudi makes a surprisingly insensitive, unnecessary remark that stands out among his usually moderate tone: “I don’t care, hand on the wheel, drivin’ drunk, I’m doin’ my thing.” And though “Sky Might Fall” is Cudi’s most forthcoming song emotionally—“And then you see ’em / Gray clouds up above, man / Metaphor to my life, man / Still I feel my heart stronger than it’s ever been, / Strong will ’til my journey ends, / ‘Til then I roll…”—it seems a bit insincere in light of its remarkable similarities to Kanye’s “Welcome to Heartbreak.” “Man on the Moon: The End of Day” is futuristic, but in other ways it’s also a throwback. Cudi’s rhymes hearken back to an “old school” style rap lyricism, but his blend of genres and forward-thinking production keep him from getting mired in any one cast. His willingness to experiment artistically is notable, especially for a newcomer to the hip-hop scene. With “Man on the Moon,” Kid Cudi embraces the challenge of bringing hip-hop to a wider audience, and in so doing stretches the established boundaries of the genre itself.

Matt Bellamy and Muse rarely preoccupy themselves with trivial concerns. You only need peruse the titles of a few of British rock trio’s most popular songs to get an idea of what their music is all about: “Time Is Running Out,” “Supermassive Black Hole,” “Apocalypse Please.” Once in a great while, as with their cover of “Feeling Good,” a curve ball might crop up, but for the most part, Muse sing about one thing: the end of the world.A theme that big requires music of a similar scale to prop it up. For Muse, that means crunching guitar riffs and driving base lines overlaid with Matt Bellamy’s operatic, choirboy-gone-bad falsetto. When all these elements come together, Muse songs can be sublime slices of ominous, oddly euphoric prog rock; when they don’t, the songs veer quickly into the realm of the absurd. Through four albums of material, Muse’s releases have generally tended towards the former. “Black Holes and Revelations,” realeased in 2006, finally earned them popularity in the U.S. to match the fanatic following they enjoy in their native country, the U.K. Their new record, “The Resistance,” has spent the last year or so building hype and collecting a variety of unlikely rumors about its contents—including speculation about African and electronic influences. The reality is less exotic. On “The Resistance,” Muse supplements the apocalyptic theme with a bit of government oppression and even a couple of twisted love songs, but mostly they don’t venture far from their familiar territory, both lyrically and musically.The album kicks off with the two songs which stick closest of all to their formula. A pulsating bassline and whining, mesmeric synths propel the album’s first single “Uprising.” It’s all fairly predictable—especially the chorus, in which Matt Bellamy decries with typical fist-pumping authority: “They will not force us / They will stop degrading us / They will not control us / We will be victorious.” Track two, “Resistance,” starts slowly with a rudimentary piano riff, but it doesn’t take long to build to the same cathartic plateau as its predecessor. If it had been the second track on their debut album, it might have deserved high praise, but at this point, it just feels obvious.After the album’s only real jump-up-and-down anthems, Muse shifts gears. “Undisclosed Desires” is an eminently danceable track with a syncopated Keytar line that will induce waves of envy in electronica/hip-hop artists everywhere. The lyrical theme is lust, not love, and that lust is articulated with a creepy, sickly kind of longing that will send a shiver or two down your spine: “I want to reconcile the demons from your past,” Bellamy croons, “I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart.” The album’s middle section, which lags insufferably, is its biggest failure. “United States of Eurasia” is a plodding, overdone mess. The chorus has plenty of volume but not much else. Instrumentally, the vaguely Far Eastern interludes are dull and uninspired, and the lounge-style piano playing that closes out the song is just plain irrelevant. The whole six minutes feels like Queen sans the sing-alongs—and the tunes. This unmitigated disaster is immediately followed by the funereally paced “Guiding Light.” It’s no better than its predecessor, further proving that loudness doesn’t preclude tedium. “I Belong to You” is lively enough, but you can’t help but wonder whether Muse’s apocalyptic sound is really suited to such lovelorn lyrical material.This litany of mediocrity is only interrupted by track six, “Unnatural Selection.” With shouted, drunken sports fan-style “hey!”s, and a surging guitar riff, it’s the kind of propulsive tune that could send Muse fans into paroxysms of joy at their live shows. The downside: at seven minutes, it’s about three too long.Finally, we come to the song which has dominated press coverage of The Resistance: the three-part, 12-minute “Exogenesis: Symphony,” an exercise in infinitely pretentious bombast that few other artists would dare attempt. “Part I (Overture),” is an orchestral (literally, as it features a full orchestra), beautifully realized number. Sinisterly thrumming strings, triumphal brass flourishes, and unintelligibly mewed lyrics from Bellamy coalesce into something with unexpected emotional power, considering it’s entirely incomprehensible. “Part II (Cross-Pollination),” in the tradition of classical symphonies, is a bit of a breather—a piano-led track which feels comfortably familiar, if uninspired. To someone unaware of where one track ends and the next begins, “Part II” might pass entirely unnoticed. It does, however, serve as an excellent segue into “Part III (Redemption),” which starts slowly and builds achingly into an ode to new beginnings. Bellamy’s vocals have never felt quite so heartfelt as they do when “Part III” reaches its climax, and he pleads, “Why can’t we start it over again?”As one, 12-minute unit, “Exogenesis Symphony” is not Muse’s best ever song, but with its unmatched scope, scale and caliber of composition, it might still be their magnum opus.Though it ends on a high note, “The Resistance” is a mixed bag. It includes both a couple of Muse’s best songs, and a couple of their worst. As an album, it flows neither thematically nor musically. In fact, it sounds a little like Muse took their nine favorite songs from the recording session, threw them together in no particular order and called it a day. “Uprising,” “Undisclosed Desires” and “Exogenesis Symphony” alone might make a five-star EP—just don’t be surprised if you find yourself fast-forwarding through the rest.

Listeners new to The Dodos may recognize their song “Fools,” from their 2008 breakout album “Visiter,” from a recent Miller Chill commercial. Aptly, their echoey new album, “Time to Die,” sounds like they recorded in a beer bottle.The indie folk-pop duo’s signature spare sound, with drums and guitar receiving equal billing, have made “Visiter” a standout in a line of releases from other over-arranged indie darlings. Their percussive approach added a twist to a pleasant, but unoriginal, pop formula. Unfortunately, their new album deviates from their previous work and plops them back in the queue.The band’s third outing, “Time to Die” features a fuller sound, in part because The Dodos are now a trio. New member Keaton Snyder’s vibraphone augments Long’s vocals and acoustic guitar, as well as Kroeber’s drums. The xylophone-like instrument contributes to the Dodo’s new, more complex musical approach, but it is not the only culprit.In addition to the added vibraphone, producer Phil Ek (Built to Spill, The Shins) establishes a more layered sound. Though this results in the best Dodos record for headphones, the thicker sound is disappointingly inorganic. The enveloping blanket contains some interesting elements, but Kroeber’s drums almost disappear into the background wash of noise. Throughout the album, sterile tones fill what would have been silences in their earlier work. Keaton’s addition heralds a fuller and admittedly more echoey version of their previous style, but it detracts from the band’s originally interesting simplicity.The added effects attempt, and fail, to hide fairly shoddy song writing. “Time to Die” is not as tuneful as “Visiter” and their new sonic elements, though adventurous, fail to be as intriguing as the catchy melodies of their former work. “Fables” comes closest with an almost infectious chorus: “I don’t want to go in the fire / I just want to stay in my home / I don’t want to hear all the liars / I just want to be with my own.” But, as with the rest of the album, everything is fuzzed and echoed out, from the drums to the voices. “The Strums” is the most representative of the album’s weaknesses: pleasant to listen to but sonically overcrowded. The sheer number of guitar layers overwhelms the listener and makes a mess of the song; without any tangible forward direction, the song flags easily. The extra noise feels baroque for its own sake and contributes nothing, making “The Strums” forgettable.However, “Time to Die” improves with repeated exposure, as illustrated in “Small Deaths.” The first time around, the song seems overlong and disjointed. But after a second go, the song’s centerpiece emerges as inherently listenable, in the fashion of “Red and Purple,” off “Visiter.”“This Is A Business” eschews the snail-pace that many of the other songs fall into. Also to its credit, its arc is the most emergent of the set. But its experimental tuning and discordant guitar work nearly negates a brief, but shining, moment of Beatlesque pop. Unfortunately the middle of the song goes off into a slow, jarring tangent, and the song’s momentum is stymied by unnecessary noodlings. Because Long often gives in to experimental impulses, the songs on “Time to Die” are entirely too long, averaging around four and a half minutes with the longest, “Troll Nacht,” clocking in at over six. The length, combined with a persistent background of confused reverberations, makes it hard to focus on any one song, but well-suited for background music.However grandiose their ambitions, this album shows the Dodos struggling to find their place in an already crowded niche of merely inoffensive indie-pop; “Time to Die” is pleasant to listen to, but Arcade Fire does it too and with more chutzpah.—Staff writer Candace I.

HEALTH can be identified as part of a growing contingent of indie rock bands that channel noise-rock and new wave influences into a revivalist genre often described as “Nu Gaze.” Nu Gaze acts are prone to two common pitfalls: they can be little more than cheap imitations of their legendary forebears, and they can fail to augment their aural attack with subtlety. HEALTH, to their credit, have avoided the path of mere derivation. As with their fellow L.A. scenesters No Age, one of the few bands to successfully grapple with Nu Gaze in recent years, the four piece has created a brutal, hybrid sound that is entirely its own. Unfortunately, originality alone does not a triumph make, and “Get Color” largely shows that while HEALTH has plenty of promise, the band has yet to discover how to make a consistently good album. That is not to say that the traditional new wave and shoegaze traits aren’t visible in “Get Color,” their sophomore studio outing. The indelible stamp of My Bloody Valentine can be heard in Jake Duzsik’s vocals. Whereas Kevin Shields and Bilinda Butcher’s heavily dubbed harmonies were central to that band’s sound, Duzsik attempts to recreate that kind of sound individually, singing between tenor and contralto through a rather liberal use of reverb. He successfully generates an effect of androgyny, but the vocals can feel insincere as a result. HEALTH’s originality has always been most evident in the sheer force and power of their sound. Their 2007 eponymous debut album was unrelenting in its fury, the repetitive, ear-splitting synths enhanced by maniacal drumming that would put most thrash bands to shame. Unfortunately, on that record, the songs were virtually indistinguishable, and the continuous electronic mayhem was overkill. HEALTH urgently needed an induction of discipline. The greatest success of “Get Color” is the way that HEALTH has harnassed its fury, exhibiting greater control and less self-indulgence. At 35 minutes, it is admirably concise, and the songs are generally taut. But with a lack of melody and an obsession with death and destruction that is never convincing, “Get Color” can be a wearying listen. The album opens with “In Heat,” an essentially meaningless piece of noise that clocks in at only 1:48 but would still count as filler if it were anywhere else in the album. As an opener, it serves as the intro to “Die Slow,” the album’s lead single and most representative song. “Die Slow” has all the elements of HEALTH’s style: a mix of elaborate, heavy synths with drums and guitar, buried androgynous vocals and an industrial feel that is reminiscent of Trent Reznor. The industrial influence ads color musically, but it fails to provide thematic depth. The album is steeped in monotonously dark imagery; take for further evidence the songs entitled “Severin” and “Eat Flesh.” What the record needs is a little lightness, a relief from its overbearing gloom. The unyielding, pounding percussion only reinforces the prevailing theme. The album’s best songs, “Death +” and “Before Tigers,” succeed because they eschew the affectations of noise rock and the excesses of overwrought industrial metal, instead incorporating their androgynous vocals and skillful arrangements into a jammy, electronica–meets–rock framework that resembles, without imitating, the more relaxed aesthetic that Radiohead employed with “In Rainbows.” The restraint demonstrated in these songs make them the only ones which reveal musical and vocal subtleties on repeated listens.“Before Tigers” is followed by the decidedly unsubtle “Severin” and “Eat Flesh,” which are the closest “Get Color” comes to the all out sonic violence of their eponymous debut. After that, however, there is a sudden and even forced change of pace. The final tracks, “We Are Water” and “In Violet,” are slower, dirgelike experiments with softness. Both unfortunately fall flat because HEALTH appear completely incapable of coming up with melodic beauty, even of a disturbing kind. Instead, the album peters out—anticlimax rather than conclusion. There is much to like and admire about HEALTH. They have ambition, musical skill, fabulous drumming and the ability to combine a remarkably diverse set of influences into something recognizably their own. Yet their project is in a sense doomed by its very nature. The number of great albums that are this uniformly morbid and humorless can be counted on one hand, and Jake Duzsik is no Ian Curtis. For now they remain a band of promise rather than one of real achievement. —Staff writer Keshava D. Guha can be reached at kdguha@fas.harvard.edu.

Like many living in Israel and the Palestinian Territories today, Avi Mograbi cannot recall a moment in his life without the presence of war or political strife. It comes as no surprise, then, that Mograbi, an Israeli filmmaker, deals with these elements in each of his highly stylized non-fiction films. Mograbi will visit the Harvard Film Archive on Sunday, Sep. 20 to give a lecture accompanying a screening of his most recent film, “Z32.”“Z32,” which is based on the confession of an Israeli soldier, describes his involvement in the revenge slayings of two Palestinian police officers. The title refers to the incident’s file number, the story of which Mograbi found in the archives of an organization that collects testimonies from ex-Israeli soldiers. In this film, Mograbi, who is also the narrator, takes his artistic aspirations to new levels, using animation, computer-generated imagery, and other surrealist elements to “mask” the young man, making him unidentifiable. According to Mograbi, these devices allowed him to enhance the film’s artistic qualities and preserve the anonymity of the soldier. Mograbi says that he also changed how he narrated the film. “Like previous films, I am always there commenting on the dilemmas [of the subjects], and this time I don’t do it by talking but by singing,” Mograbi says. “This [method] has developed over a while looking for a different way of expression,” he continues. “Singing allows myself to distance myself from the material... and look at the artistic aspects.”All eight of Mograbi’s films focus on the conflict between Israel and Palestine, particularly on how the constant violence between the two territories impacts their residents. Mograbi is well-known for adding incongruous elements to his films, including dark humor and his own musings, which often reflect his pacifist views. He says that his aversion to violence began to develop after a stint as a reserve soldier in 1983, when he refused to fight in the war between Israel and Lebanon. “I thought the war was initiated for no reason,” he says, “but now my views are more so. At the time, I was against this specific war, but now I don’t think I would [serve] in any war.”However, Mograbi is careful to emphasize that his passionate political views are not responsible for his interest in filmmaking. He refuses to acknowledge any formative experiences that account for his career. He explains that he had always intended to be an artist. “Making films is part of my life,” Mograbi says. Although his films are often billed as documentaries, Mograbi insists they are not. “My films are first and foremost pieces of art.”The way in which Mograbi’s politics inform his art has been a source of contention among critics. A notable scene in his 2005 film, “Avenge But One of My Two Eyes,” features Arab men forced to stand on rocks by Israeli soldiers. Many have observed parallels between this scene and the images from Abu Ghraib that dominated international media at the time the movie was released. According to Mograbi, however, there are no such parallels, and those who view his movies should refrain from making direct comparisons between movie scenes and other political events. “I film things for themselves,” Mograbi says. However, he acknowledges the value that “Z32” and his other films have for international audiences. “I would be very happy if lots of Israelis watched the film,” he says, “but certainly other countries engaged in war, such as America, can benefit.”

When Bren Bataclan started the Smile Project six years ago, he never anticipated that it would spread to 25 states and 35 countries. Yet the project, which Bataclan developed in Boston, has built up a worldwide following as it spreads its message of cheerfulness.The concept of the Smile Project involves Bataclan leaving paintings in public spaces, with a note inviting passers-by to take the painting. His only request was that in exchange, they make an effort to smile at strangers. Bataclan was inspired by his perception that smiles were something lacking in everyday life. “I went to graduate school in the Midwest and when I came here I expected hyper-warmth and I didn’t feel it,” Bataclan says. “But then I saw people smiling at my work, and thought giving people my paintings was a way to make them smile. And then I’d get more smiles too.”With a collection of characters he has been sketching since childhood, Bataclan’s work easily lends itself to inspiring this kind of warmth amongst strangers. His “cartoon-inspired acrylic paintings” feature figures that appear in bright colors with accoutrements such as antennas and bug eyes rendered adorable by the wide grins on their faces.“My goal is to have the minimum amount of detail with the maximum amount of personality,” Bataclan says. He refers to his characters as “creatures” since they are not exactly human and not exactly animal, but seem more like a friendly visitor from outer space.Originally, Bataclan moved from San Francisco to be a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Yet today he is busy appearing at art festivals, illustrating children’s books, and exhibiting at the American consulate and embassy of his native Philippines. “If you’d asked me seven years ago if I’d paint full-time, I’d laugh” he says.The majority of his business comes from commissions, which is what enables the Smile Project to continue. “Each month I save X amount of money, and leave five to 15 paintings,” Bataclan says. “In lean times just five, in really good times I leave more.” In the past year the message associated with the project has changed, though the ultimate goal remains the same. Since the economic downturn began last year, Bataclan changed the notes to proclaim a message that “Everything will be alright.” “I feel like, as an artist, this is one of the best ways that I can help out right now,” Bataclan says. Since he changed his note, Bataclan has begun leaving more paintings in unemployment offices, hoping that this timely message will also be able to bring people comfort.Since Bataclan is a local artist, residents of Boston and Cambridge have a greater opportunity to see his work. The mural at Berryline’s Arrow Street location is one permanent example, but there’s also a good chance that locals will be able to personally participate in the Smile Project. “I’ve left a lot in Harvard Square. It’s probably my favorite spot,” he says.  “It’s fun to leave them around schools because students don’t hesitate to pick up things for free,” Bataclan says. “I find that non-college students, or older people, are a little more cynical. They think it’s tied into some kind of product placement.” “I get shy when people pick them up,” he says, explaining why he no longer waits to see if people will pick up his paintings. Even if he were to wait for someone, he wouldn’t be waiting long. “Most get picked up within three to 30 minutes, at least in America,” he says. As for other parts of the world, “It’s a free-for-all,” he says. Bataclan takes one major vacation a year and brings a suitcase full of paintings along; the rest are distributed by family and friends during their own travels. “I’m not independently wealthy,” he explains.But clearly for Bataclan, wealth is secondary to happiness, a quality he seems to be bursting with. “How can I complain?” he asks. “This is my first pain-free type of work.” —Staff writer Kerry A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When we’re so used to seeing the likes of our beloved “Arrested Development” and “Freaks and Geeks” terminated before their time, it’s easy to forget that even the best shows have an expiration date. The sixth season of “The Office” will premiere next Thursday, but I wish it wouldn’t. It’s not that the fifth season’s subplots weren’t funny—think Michael Scott Paper Company or the introduction of Rolf, Dwight’s new best friend—it’s that they all feel like another way for the writers to stave off the inevitable. Sure, episodes like the absurd tour de force “Café Disco” are an occasional blip on the EEG, but they are growing less frequent. Whatever disease “The Office” has, it’s terminal. By all accounts, “The Office” should not have succeeded in the first place. Channel 4’s “Peep Show,” a dark, quirky gem of a single-camera comedy, was remade for Fox in 2005—the same year that the first season of the “The Office” aired stateside—and was never commissioned beyond the pilot. More recently, a U.S. version of “Kath & Kim,” Australia’s Logie-winning favorite, enjoyed only a brief, critically disastrous stay on NBC last year. In retrospect, though, creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant seem to have stumbled upon one of the hardiest premises in television history; “The Office” has been successfully transported to France, Canada, Germany, and Chile.  The largely unimpressive pilot of the American “Office” had an almost identical script to that of the British premiere. Slough became Scranton, Tim became Jim, and in one memorable punchline, “Camilla Parker Bowles” became “Hillary Clinton.” It took a uniquely American episode—the all-around-genius “Diversity Day,” written by B.J. Novak ’01—to win us over. Best of all, we found the U.S. “Office” to be populated with wonderfully bizarre secondary characters, developed far more deeply than the few on the U.K. version. More of my favorite television moments involve Creed Bratton than any other character, on any show. Back in 2001, Gervais and Merchant established a modest television timeline—two, six-episode seasons plus a Christmas special—that suited “The Office” perfectly, as it would “Extras,” their brilliant sophomore effort. And yes, the first season of the American “Office” also had six installments. The second? 22. Don’t get me wrong—the second season is probably the show’s best, and by the time the finale, “Casino Night,” aired, no one was complaining that we’d seen too many episodes that year. But by keeping this pace, they’ve racked up one hundred to date. American sitcoms are on growth hormones, and the results aren’t always pretty. In particular, the ticking time bomb strapped to “The Office” has always been the development of Jim and Pam’s relationship. Remember the first season, when it was thrilling just to see Pam fall asleep with her head on Jim’s shoulder? What is there to look forward to now—Jim and Pam’s baby wryly acknowledging the camera in his sonogram? Sexual tension is the life and death of sitcoms. “Cheers” was all Sam and Diane, and when it wasn’t, it was Sam and Rebecca, and when it wasn’t, it... wasn’t. Some of the same writers moved to “Frasier,” where they perfected the art of the slow burn.  In the alternative TV universe where Niles and Daphne have sex and get it over with in the first season, they might have been raising a first grader by the time they actually kiss in season seven. And it’s not that the writers of “The Office” haven’t figured this out. In fact, they’re all too aware of the problem. It’s clear that they’ve attempted the delicate act of shifting the show’s focus away from Jim and Pam, with renewed attention to the romantic misadventures of Michael and Holly, and Angela and... everyone. But once we’ve veered away from the Jim-and-Pam arc, the zaniness we love in the other characters actually works against them; there’s nothing to ground the show. “The Office” is spectacular because it’s fundamentally based in reality. It’s not another show about eccentric, attractive young urbanites cohabiting an apartment disproportionate to their income. It’s about a boring workplace, a terrible boss, and a likeable couple falling in love. Its genius is in its simplicity. As great as Dwight and Andy’s budding bromance may be, the secondary characters aren’t enough to drive the plot. Without a solid footing, The Office has begun an inevitable decline into mediocrity. So, next Thursday night at 9 p.m., I’m going to make popcorn and blow off any responsibilities I need to so that I can sit down and watch “The Office” premiere with my friends. And, if you asked, I’d probably still name “The Office” as one of my favorite shows on television, because it’s still good. But it won’t be for long.—Columnist Molly O.

Harvard University Health Services has ordered between 12,000 and 13,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, although the first shipment will be earmarked for high-risk groups and is not expected until October, said UHS director David S. Rosenthal ’59.Of the vaccine ordered, 2,000 to 3,000 doses are specifically for groups including pregnant women, emergency medical services personnel, and people between the ages of 5 and 24 with chronic health conditions, according to Rosenthal.UHS has a list of those people within the University who are high-risk and who will receive the H1N1 vaccine first.The state has already begun production of the H1N1 vaccine, and, optimistically, UHS could receive “a lot” of the H1N1 vaccine ordered by the end of October, Rosenthal said.Since the end of August, 120 people have gone to UHS with influenza-like illnesses, about 80 to 85 percent of whom are undergraduates, according to Rosenthal.This number is much higher than the usual number of sick students in September.“What we’re seeing in a day, we might be seeing in a week last year,” Rosenthal said.Of the 120 cases since August, about 50 are currently active. These students are either in isolated rooms, at home, or in Stillman Infirmary.“Everyone at Stillman has been phenomenal,” said Kevin W.H. Chi ’10, who has been in Stillman for five days with flu-like symptoms, including a 103 degree fever and a cough. “UHS tends to get a bad rap. I’ve been taken care of very well.” Chi said he receives food from Harvard University Dining Services every day after he fills out his requests on a printed menu.Stillman can accommodate up to 15 people if necessary, but it is not currently full. Sick students with single bedrooms can opt to return to their rooms in order to remain isolated, and undergraduates with family within two to three hours of campus can be sent to their family members.UHS has also located 38 empty bedrooms throughout the House system in which to isolate students who cannot return home and do not have single bedrooms, in case Stillman becomes full. Fewer than five students have used these rooms so far. Rosenthal declined to detail the location of these rooms.HUDS has arranged to deliver food to students who are being isolated in single bedrooms or in the empty bedrooms around campus.Carly L. Dickson ’12 said she had a fever and went to UHS, where she was sent back to her double bedroom; her roommate slept in the common room. She said HUDS was supposed to deliver her food, but they never came.The state no longer recommends testing to distinguish H1N1 flu from seasonal flu, so students who have flu symptoms—including a fever and cough—are simply told they have an influenza-like illness.But Rosenthal said that most of the influenza-like illness cases are probably H1N1 flu, since seasonal flu usually presents itself later in the year.This year’s large number of flu cases has increased the UHS clinic load, forcing UHS to bring in more clinicians and nurse practitioners on nights and weekends, Rosenthal said.UHS has also been active in vaccinating people against the seasonal flu, and has given out 2,000 free doses so far.—Staff writer Danielle J.

After failing to turn in the paperwork necessary to appear on the ballot for November’s Cambridge City Council election, five-term incumbent Councillor Marjorie C. Decker is attempting to become the first candidate in recent history to wage a successful write-in campaign.On Wednesday, Decker, a Cambridge native, sent an e-mail to supporters asking for backing and donations and explaining her sticker campaign, which distributes stickers with her name on them so that voters can affix them to ballots.In addition to hiring an attorney to ensure that all goes smoothly on and after election day, Decker has worked to raise voter awareness of her campaign by e-mailing supporters with an explanation of her campaign and will soon release a how-to video instructing voters in the correct procedures for casting a write-in ballot.Decker said she has asked the election commission several questions about the election process, but they have yet to provide her with details about how they will address the unique situation, so her focus will be on reaching voters. The absence of Decker’s name from the ballot may give challengers a leg up in the election. Cambridge resident and attorney Silvia P. Glick, who says she is concerned with defending Cambridge’s neighborhoods from overdevelopment, said that she believes that some people who voted for Decker in the past will now switch their votes.“I think that people should be asking why someone who’s really interested in being elected to the City Council waited until the last day to file her nomination papers, and why is it a task that she assigns to other people?” Glick said.But other challengers said they would not change their campaign approach.“Marjorie is a strong opponent, you can’t count her out,” said Council candidate Leland Cheung, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School.Both Decker and other incumbents acknowledge the difficulty of being elected as a write-in candidate.“Running a write-in campaign is going to be immensely challenging, especially with Cambridge’s complicated election system,” said Councillor Craig A. Kelley.Under the City’s single-vote-transfer proportional-representation system, each voter ranks nine candidates for the Council, including write-ins. Candidates who are ranked first on ten percent of ballots are declared elected. Any extra ballots they receive beyond the ten percent quota are redistributed to the candidates marked next in preference on those excess ballots.The count continues with the elimination of those candidates who received fewer than 50 first place rankings and the redistribution of their ballots to other candidates according to the next preference marked. After each, the candidate with lowest number of votes is eliminated, and ballots are again redistributed. Cambridge is the only city in the country that uses this electoral system.“Marjorie, though she’s won five elections now, has never reached the [10 percent] quota,” said Robert Winters, editor of the Cambridge Civic Journal, an instructor at the Extension School, and a one-time council candidate.“She’s always relied upon having second and third—whatever—preferences from other candidates,” he said. “It’s hard to get that if your name is not on the ballot.”But Decker said she believes that residents are aware of her campaign.“One of the biggest issues in this campaign season is my write-in campaign,” Decker said, “The feedback I’m getting is that people are aware of it.”The candidate—who used to read the names of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq at Council meetings to enter them into the city record—said that her constituency consists of “people who care about issues that affect working families...youth issues...and seniors,” as well as residents of Cambridgeport, where she grew up, and North Cambridge, where she lives now with her husband and newborn child. Cambridge municipal elections will be held on Tuesday, November 3.—Staff writer Sarah J. Howland can be reached at showland@fas.harvard.edu.

Exactly 222 years after the U.S. Constitution was signed, David H. Souter ’61—who stepped down from the Supreme Court this June—joined a panel of legal-minded Harvard professors yesterday in celebrating the nation’s founding document with a lively debate about its relevance.Souter has garnered a reputation for steering clear of the public limelight, preferring instead to retire to Weare, N.H., to the small farmhouse that was home to his parents and grandparents.But on the anniversary of the 1787 signing of the Constitution (and his 70th birthday), Souter, sporting a navy blue Lowell House tie, returned to his alma mater, providing a glimpse into his 19-year tenure on the Supreme Court during Harvard’s annual Constitution Day event.For the past five years, Harvard has observed this anniversary with lectures by preeminent Harvard Law School professors including Cass R. Sunstein ’75, who is now heading the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.Harvard, which received about $535 million from the federal government in the 2008 fiscal year, is required per a 2004 federal law for all schools receiving federal funding to provide an annual lesson on the nation’s founding document.In the spirit embodied by the event’s title, “The U.S. Constitution: What Should We Celebrate and What Should We Criticize,” a five-member panel debated the document’s merits during a lively debate before Souter’s much-anticipated appearance on stage.Law School Professor Charles Fried opened the discussion by professing his veneration for the 7,500-word document, only to have his fellow Law School professor Michael J. Klarman sharply criticize the Constitution for its irrelevancy and endorsement of values that should be rejected, such as slavery.“We are responsible for our own fate,” Klarman said, refusing to give the original framers of the Constitution or the Supreme Court credit for the “many things about our political culture we can take pride in,” primarily civil rights protection. “To delude ourselves from thinking otherwise is a mistake, and a potentially dangerous one.”The panel also included Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67, visiting professor to HLS and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Sanford V. Levinson, and Kennedy School professor Alexander Keyssar ’69—who, after Klarman’s rousing 12-minute diatribe against the Constitution’s failings, joked that the audience might as well “roll it and smoke it.”Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92, who clerked for Souter (“the best year of my life,” he confessed) in 1998, spent the rest of the event teasing out of Souter his views on approaching Court decisions.Souter, whose polite but persistent questioning of lawyers who appear before the court and gracefully written opinions reflect his relatively liberal stance, described himself as a “pragmatic,” in the sense that he “worries first about the case and factual details of a case before deciding just how grand a principle is necessary to decide it.”“That’s why I espouse the common law method, which gets down to nitty-gritty kinds of factual issues to decide which of the competing principles have a better argument in a given case,” Souter explained. When asked about the role of judges, Souter said their job is “making the law” in the sense that they must decide the answers to questions the legislative branch did not account for at the time of a given statute’s passing.One of the few Supreme Court justices to step down from the bench while in good health, Souter said that he plans to undertake a variety of part-time jobs, such as returning to the First Circuit in Boston, where he spent just one day hearing cases before starting his tenure at the Supreme Court.Souter has also joined a committee in his home state of New Hampshire that aims to provide statewide standards for a curriculum of civic education—a “subject that has nationally fallen into great disrepair.” And “quite frankly,” the now-retired Supreme Court Justice of simple, but eccentric, tastes (most notably his daily lunch of yogurt and an apple, including the core), said he was looking forward to “do[ing] some concentrated reading.”—Staff writer June Q.

Harvard and four other of the nation’s most prominent research universities are collaborating to make a major push for open access to scholarly research.The five-member compact on open-access publication, signed on Tuesday by Harvard, Dartmouth, Cornell, MIT, and the University of California at Berkeley, marks a growing consensus on the need for a fairer system of online scholarship.The agreement on open-access publication makes current scholarly research available for all readers online at no cost. Though the new open-access model of online publication eliminates traditional subscription and processing fees, it maintains essential features of journal publication such as peer review and the “author-pays” model, in which the author must pay the publisher for the article to appear.The free access not only benefits readers but is especially beneficial for authors looking to expand their readership. “Open-access journals and closed-access journals operate in exactly the same way with the exception of their business models,” Computer Science Professor Stuart M. Shieber ’81, the faculty director of the Office for Scholarly Communication at Harvard, wrote in an e-mailed statement.Even under the open-access model, authors generally must pay fees to publishers. This has led some professors to worry that the economic downturn will keep lesser-known authors from publishing due to higher fees that may be implemented to offset costs, according to John Saylor, an associate librarian at Cornell.“We’ve just about hit the ceiling on what universities are able to support in terms of subscription costs, especially with the current recession,” Dartmouth Associate Librarian Elizabeth E. Kirk said. “Each time a university library cancels a journal, that university community loses access to that scholarship.”Despite tighter budgets at universities across the country, the schools in the five-member compact are not overly concerned about authors’ abilities to afford the costs to publishers. Most authors rely on university grants, so the compact “doesn’t really affect the way authors write and publish,” said MIT Scholarly Publishing and Licensing Consultant Ellen F. Duranceau. Shieber, the Harvard professor, believes that in order to address the loss of scholarly subscriptions, open access should be supported. “As access to the subscription literature shrinks, it becomes even more important for Harvard researchers to make their articles available open access,” he wrote. Readers can access the repository of articles written by Harvard faculty and researchers through the Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard (DASH) Web site.

George L. Walsh, former captain of the Harvard University Police Department, possessed an alarming capacity for generosity—sometimes even at the expense of his children’s comfort.On his morning commutes to Harvard, Walsh would periodically embarrass his children by stopping his car to offer rides to strangers standing along Mt. Auburn St.—he knew bus stops were especially fertile places to find people. “Dad, what are you doing?” daughter Barbara J. Walsh remembers asking her father on those morning trips.The genial former police captain, a man who acquaintances say practiced this same shameless generosity to students in his decades of service at Harvard, passed away in a hospice facility at 2 a.m. yesterday after years of declining health. He was 91.Walsh joined the Harvard police force in 1952 and rose to the position of captain sometime prior to 1967, according to his son Thomas E. Walsh, who could not remember the exact year of his father’s appointment.“The stories about him helping students were absolutely legion,” said Arthur G. Luongo, a former HUPD sergeant who worked for Walsh. “From day one, he was always devoted to the Harvard community...I think the happiest years of his life were spent at the Harvard police department. There’s no doubt about it.”During his time at Harvard, Walsh was a stalwart proponent of protecting students and taking a “more paternal approach”—not seeking solely to punish them, according to Barbara Walsh.In the aftermath of an Aug. 8, 2008 incident in which HUPD officers confronted a young black man attempting to remove a lock from his own bicycle, Walsh wrote a firmly-worded letter to the district attorney of Boston to voice his concern about the growing disconnect between Harvard police and students, according to his daughter.“He used to walk the Yard, and he would know students by name...but the police and students no longer know each other on a personal level,” Barbara Walsh said. “He thought that the police should be more protective of the students rather than trying to be militaristic.”“He was sad to see the change,” she added.Though Walsh retired in 1984, he continued to pick up odd jobs, including working for Barbara, an attorney, from the age of 78 to 88. He volunteered at a homeless shelter and became a deacon at his Catholic church. But when old age began to limit his range of activity, he entered the care of his family. At the conclusion of his 91st birthday party two weeks ago, Walsh fell and broke a few bones in his back and pelvis, landing him in the hospital. Walsh’s family was informed that his condition would not improve, and his diabetes and already deteriorating health pushed him towards his end.“He’s probably the best boss I’ve ever had in my life,” Luongo said. “He is the best person anybody could ever work for. I wouldn’t equivocate on that at all.”—Staff writer Esther I. Yi can be reached at estheryi@fas.harvard.edu.

A recently released U.S. News & World Report ranking of U.S. law schools placed Yale ahead of Stanford and Harvard based on the percentage of 2007 graduates from each school who received employment as judicial clerks. Clerks are assigned to one judge or justice and are charged with reviewing briefs and conducting research for pending cases.The ranking system takes into account both the percentage of graduates employed as clerks in any court and the percentage of graduates employed as clerks in Article III courts, which include the U.S. Supreme Court, the 12 U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the 94 U.S. District Courts.“Clerkship is a terrific training opportunity and exposes a young lawyer to the inner workings of the judicial system,” said Craig Primis, a 1994 Harvard Law School alumnus now employed at Kirkland and Ellis, LLP. After graduating from law school, Primis clerked for Judge J. Michael Luttig on the U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, before taking a clerkship for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Primis noted that clerking is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that can “distinguish and advance one’s legal career.”According to the rankings, 41.4 percent of 2007 Yale Law School graduates were employed in judicial clerkships, with 37.0 percent of the class clerking in Article III courts. In contrast, 20.6 percent of the Harvard Law Class of 2007 worked in judicial clerkships, with 18.2 percent of the class in Article III courts.Law schools are often judged on the basis of how many of their graduates clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justices, though they are not formally ranked on this metric. Despite being about a third the size of Harvard Law, Yale currently has 10 clerks at the Court, while Harvard has nine.This year, due to errors in reporting of data, some law schools were assigned abnormally high rankings—an irregularity that saw the University of North Dakota School of Law placed above Harvard Law School for a short time.Robert J. Morse, director of data research at U.S. News & World Report, stated that law schools filled out questionnaires mailed to them in late 2008 or early 2009 and that some schools “gave the wrong percentages.” Morse stated that in the case of the University of North Dakota, when the dean realized the information was wrong, she contacted him and asked him to correct it.Rob Carolin, director of alumni and public relations at the University of North Dakota School of Law, said that the error was completely unintentional and that he was “not sure where the number came from or where the mistake came from.”Some Harvard Law students expressed doubt about using clerkship percentages to determine rankings. Nicholas A. Price, a first-year law student, said that “Yale and Stanford are known for attracting people who want to go into academia,” so it would make sense that their students would have a higher interest in clerkships. Rachel M. Sanchez, also a first-year, stated that Yale and Stanford are “more geared towards having their students become judges,” while Harvard is better known for producing corporate lawyers. Sanchez also noted that the rankings do not reflect clerkships taken by students after being employed in law firms and that they do not speak to the acceptance rate of clerkship applicants.

Standing in front of a packed Science Center lecture hall last night, Army First Lieutenant Daniel Choi burned the letter he received from the U.S. Army telling him he must leave the military after publicly coming out as gay on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” in March.Since receiving the notification from the Army, Choi has made it his mission to attack the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy on a “moral basis.”“Before I learned how to salute, march in step, execute commands, and before I received a single push up for executing them incorrectly, I learned the honor code, that a cadet should not lie,” Choi said. “I break the rules of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ because ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ breaks the rules of integrity.”Choi, who has taken classes at the Harvard Extension School, spoke after receiving the first annual Service to Humanity award from the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, an honor bestowed on a Harvard student who has shown leadership in ethical service to others. During his speech and the question-and-answer session that followed, Choi went from cracking jokes about being mentioned on the Daily Show to passionately demanding that Democratic politicians act on the desires of the gay community.A California native and the son of a Southern Baptist minister, Choi got his start in the military as an Arabic and environmental engineering major at West Point, where he received his degree in 2003. Choi later helped found Knights Out, an LGBT support group for West Point graduates.Choi served as an Arabic linguist in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 before transferring to the New York National Guard in June 2008.Harvard Humanist Chaplain Greg M. Epstein said he hoped Harvard students would pay attention to the “selflessness” Choi has shown in standing up not only for himself, but for others who are or will be faced with similar situations, despite the effect it has had on his professional life.“He simply asked for an opportunity to [serve in the military] with equality and honesty and was denied that opportunity,” Epstein said in an interview.Choi, who chose to fight his removal from the military rather than resign, said he does not yet know what type of military discharge he will receive, but he has already begun to prepare for potential appeals. In an interview with The Crimson before the event, Choi said he appreciated the stance Harvard has taken in not allowing the Reserve Officer Training Corps on campus because of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy.“The fact that Harvard believes in non-discrimination and puts ethics and morals before funding brings great credit for what Harvard stands for,” Choi said. “When I heard that Harvard had taken that step, I felt a lot of empathy. Harvard is a friend.”—Staff writer Lauren D. Kiel can be reached at lkiel@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Margherita Pignatelli can be reached at mpignat@fas.harvard.edu.

On the heels of an economic recession and the installation of a new presidential administration, Harvard students are increasingly looking towards the public sector for work experience, data and programming from campus career organizations suggest.Applicants for the Institute of Politics’ summer stipend program, which funds students working in the public sector, increased by 120 percent this spring, and applications to the IOP’s Director’s Internship program, an array of governmental summer work experiences, increased  by 60 percent from 2008, according to the IOP’s Internship Program Administrator Amy Howell. Public sector enthusiasm has also been on display at the Office of Career Services, where yesterday an information session titled, “Government, Politics, and Policy: How to find a Job” drew 48 students, prompting Interim Director of OCS Robin Mount to remark on the excitement she has seen for government work in the wake of President Barack Obama’s election.  Mount also pointed to the economic recession as a driving force behind the heightened interest in government positions. Amid the positive turnout for such events, organizations are planning more. Between mid-October and mid-November, The Center for Public Interest Careers, the IOP, and OCS plan to jointly hold 14 different events focusing on finding a job in the public sector, said Mount.These resources for Harvard students have not always been so prominent. Nick B. Manske ’09, currently working with the U.S. Diplomatic Service, remembers that during his tenure at Harvard, support and campus recruiting for government sector jobs were less available than similar resources for the private sector, “but it was there if you looked for it.”  Manske recalled having to look outside Harvard and contact a U.S. Diplomat-in-Residence at Tufts University to receive advice about the U.S. Foreign Service. This year, OCS has already hosted the CIA and State Department and is looking to have the FBI and NASA soon.Mount says that Harvard is a “target School for the CIA, FBI, and State Department because of its in-depth language programs and strong writing programs.”Renee M. Ragin ’10, a member of the non-profit “Partnership for Public Service,” a D.C.-based organization that aims to educate students about ways they can get involved in public service, also said that she had detected an increased interest in the public sector in the last year.With fewer career options available because of the economic situation, Ragin said, “people are beginning to think that government is something that they could be interested in and really do.”

What was once a disorderly storage space for mechanical equipment and slabs of wood has been transformed into a haven for physics concentrators who long lacked a study space of their own.On Monday, the Department of Physics will unveil an “undergraduate study” in the Jefferson Building that offers amenities for a specialized audience: including a stainless steel wall on which individuals can mount heavy magnetic objects and a table that provides access to pressurized air. These will come in addition to standard features like chalkboards, a projection screen, and a coffee machine.“It’s really an open space that’s meant to conform to whatever interesting ideas the undergraduates have,” said Physics professor John Doyle, who served as chair of the design committee behind the new study area. “We didn’t have a space set aside for our majors where they could maybe make a little bit more noise.”“I expect to hear lots of ‘eureka!’s and off-the-wall comments about angular momentum and the Schrodinger equation and such,” wrote associate head tutor David Morin in an e-mail statement. “You know, the usual things that come up when physics students get together.”All students who normally have access to Jefferson during the day can enter the study. During night hours, the space will be open to those with card access to the Jefferson and the Lyman Building, which are generally restricted to physics students, according to Physics concentrator Anjali M. Bhatt ’11, who served as one of two undergraduate representatives on the design committee.Doyle declined to comment on the total cost of the  new space’s construction (though the figure was significantly under budget, according to Bhatt). Morin said money had been set aside for the project before the financial crisis hit. Despite the financial constraints of recent months, the committee did not want to delay the project—even if it meant keeping embellishments less than lavish, Bhatt said.“There was a huge amount of pressure to keep expenses extremely low, so...it’s not as comfy-loungey as some may expect it to be,” said Bhatt, who added that the designers had originally intended to install hardwood floors but ultimately opted for linoleum. “That was definitely something that hung over all of the design committee’s meetings: ‘Okay, is this within our budget?’”Though the concept of an undergraduate study space had existed for as long as seven years, serious designing and planning only began during the last academic year and construction commenced three months ago, according to Bhatt. Despite the seeming delay in propelling the project forward, Doyle said financial constraints did not hamper the project’s progress, which was “right on track.”First-year graduate students already have a separate lounge area for themselves in Jefferson, Bhatt said. The committee is experimenting with the idea of having graduate students hold office hours in the new undergraduate study.Bhatt said she hopes the study will encourage concentrators—who typically find themselves dislodged from the research sector of the department—to venture from their dining hall haunts and become more involved in the department.“There is a huge disconnect between physics undergraduates taking classes and the rest of the physics community,” Bhatt said. “One of the reasons why we wanted this study built was to bring the two together—to have the undergraduates feel like they could be a part of the physics department as opposed to simply being a physics student.”“We need undergrads to be more visible in the department,” said Carol S. Davis, undergraduate student program coordinator in the physics department, whose office sits across the hall from the study. “I’ve already promised baked goods—we need to get these students in there somehow.”The study will be run by the Society of Physics Students, Morin, and Physics Professor Howard Georgi ’68, according to Bhatt.—Staff writer Esther I.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s biggest donor, who died last week in an apparent suicide, may have owed up to $100 million in back taxes and fines, the New York Times reported this week.Finn M.W. Caspersen, who gave over $30 million to the Law School and tens of millions more to other philanthropic enterprises, may have been implicated in a sweeping federal investigation of offshore bank accounts, said the Times’ anonymous source.In recent months, Swiss banking giant UBS agreed to turn over the names of thousands of its American clients to the Internal Revenue Service, as the federal government attempts to crack down on tax evasion.Caspersen held a bank account with LGT, a private bank in Liechtenstein. The government of Liechtenstein has also agreed to reveal names of wealthy American clients, an anonymous individual familiar with the investigation told the Times. It is unclear whether Caspersen’s name was mentioned in this list.According to the Times’ source, federal authorities have placed liens on the personal trusts of Caspersen’s four sons, all of whom also attended the Law School.A member of the Law School’s class of 1966, Caspersen was a prominent player in the New Jersey Republican Party and the former CEO of Beneficial Corp, a major consumer lending company. His contributions to Harvard include chairing a record-breaking Law School capital campaign that raised $476 million and endowing a wing of the new Northwest Corner Building with the largest single donation in the Law School’s history.Caspersen, 67, had been battling kidney cancer before his death on the grounds of a golf club in Westerly, Rhode Island near his summer home. He is survived by his wife Barbara, four sons, and grandchildren.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A No. 88 Harvard football jersey hangs alone in the home locker room at Dillon Field House, a subtle tribute to a former Crimson left end. 
The honored player is not listed among Harvard’s all-time statistical leaders. While he had a few truly notable moments on the field throughout a solid career, he was by no means a star for the Crimson. But it may be shortsighted to quantify the significance of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 to Harvard football—and the significance of Harvard football to Kennedy—strictly based on his on-field accomplishments in two seasons with the varsity squad.
Kennedy—who passed away on Aug. 25—is best remembered for what he became after college: the last surviving brother in a generation of an iconic American political family; a polarizing figure struck by tragedy and plagued by self-inflicted controversy; the “Lion of the Senate,” an avowed liberal who reached across the aisle in the name of getting things done for the causes he believed in.
And the Harvard football team—deeply conscious of its own history—views Kennedy’s legacy as a part of its own.
“We take great pride in the fact that [Kennedy] was a Harvard football player, from the standpoint that obviously he was one of the great legislators of all time,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says. “The reason we champion Ted Kennedy so much, is that what he accomplished is legendary in the Senate, and who he accomplished it for, I think is just as important.”
Murphy blurs the distinction between what Kennedy achieved on the gridiron and on the Senate floor, and perhaps he’s not unreasonable in doing so, as Kennedy’s personal development through success and failure as a Harvard football player was manifest in his approach to his political career.
DETERMINATION IN THE WRONG DIRECTION
Just as he would eventually follow them into politics, Kennedy followed his brothers John ’40 and Robert ’48 into Crimson football when he arrived at Harvard, successfully trying out for the freshman squad.
“Making cleat marks and crashing into other solid bodies on the same field where my brothers had played,” Ted Kennedy writes in “True Compass,” his recently-released memoir, “it didn’t seem that life could hold anything better than that.”
It was during his rookie season that Kennedy began what would become lifelong friendships with several of his teammates, including Richard J. Clasby ’54, William A. Frate ’54, and John C. Culver ’54. Culver—Kennedy’s first legislative aide in the Senate, who eventually became a Senator himself—recalls Kennedy displaying the same qualities as a teammate that he later embodied as acolleague.
“He wasn’t possessed of all the ideal attributes,” Culver says. “He just compensated for everything by such determination and will. He was strong and very courageous. Having served in the Congress [with him], the one thing that was so distinctive about Ted Kennedy was he never quit. “
But Kennedy allowed his passion for football and his friends to obscure his commitment to his coursework, and in the spring semester of his freshman year he feared that if he didn’t do well on his final Spanish exam, he would not be eligible to play for the Crimson again in the fall. 
In what he calls an “immature, spontaneous, extremely poor and wrong decision” in his memoir, Kennedy arranged to have Frate take the test for him. They were caught, and the two young men were expelled from Harvard and told they could reapply in a year or two, “if they behaved themselves,” political reporter Adam Clymer ’58 writes in his 1999 biography of Kennedy.
While Frate attended another school for a year before returning to Harvard, Kennedy enlisted in the Army. After two years in the service, spent mostly as a military police officer in Paris, Kennedy was readmitted to Harvard and resumed his status as a full-time student in the fall of 1953.
A FRESH START
In his second tour at Harvard, a more mature Kennedy proved himself a diligent student and began to fully realize his political aspirations, excelling in government and public speaking courses. His love for football never wavered, and after a year of probation in which he occupied himself playing for the Winthrop House team, Kennedy was eligible to try out for varsity.
“I think he was more serious about his work,” Culver, a Harvard Football Hall of Famer, says. “He was determined to succeed when he came back.”
Kennedy’s trademark determination served him well in the 1954 season, which he began on the varsity’s eighth and lowest squad. While other, more naturally gifted players dropped off the depth chart because of injuries or left the team for personal or academic reasons, Kennedy kept plugging away until he was finally rewarded with playing time in a game against Bucknell.
“I was so excited to be in the game that I didn’t notice when I got a tooth knocked out,” he writes.
In 1955, Harvard sputtered to a 2-7 record, but Kennedy experienced his greatest success on the football field, starting for the Crimson and playing on both sides of the ball. His signature moment came in the Harvard-Yale Game, the last of his career. With the Bulldogs up, 14-0, in the third quarter, Kennedy caught a deflected pass off the hands of Dexter S. Lewis ’56 in the endzone for the Crimson’s only score of the game. Yale would go on to win, 21-7, but Kennedy celebrated his touchdown with his family and secured a triumphant end to his days as a football player.
After graduation, Kennedy received a letter inviting him to try out for the Green Bay Packers (“He used that letter whenever he campaigned in Wisconsin,” Clymer, a former Crimson president, recalls in an interview). But as the story goes, Kennedy famously turned down the offer in favor of “another contact sport—politics.”
With that, a chapter in Kennedy’s life was over, and his football career was tucked away in his legacy as little more than a footnote, useful for an amusing anecdote or two. But Kennedy’s days with the Crimson reveal much about the figure America would come to know so well in the following decades, and with every election he won, every speech he delivered, every piece of legislation he passed, Kennedy continued to contribute to Harvard football’s sense of its own history and identity.
“I remember waking up that morning and hearing that Ted Kennedy had died,” Crimson captain Carl Ehrlich says. “I went to the stadium and the flag was flying at half-mast and I got goosebumps to be associated with the program.
“[Kennedy] was the quintessential statesmen,” Ehrlich continues. “There could not be a better person to represent Harvard football.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s good to be the best. Hot off back-to-back Ivy League championship seasons, Harvard football is sitting before a plate piled high with expectations. The 2009 Ivy League preseason media poll gave Harvard a decisive 10 first-place votes, while Penn took four and Brown three. Harvard is also the only Ivy League team to crack the Football Championship Series (FCS, formerly Division 1-AA) Top-25 poll—earning the No. 25 spot. With the bar set so high, the Crimson is again the team to beat in 2009.“We seem to have a bull’s-eye on our back and our front,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “[We] seem to be everybody’s big game, and everybody is all jacked up to play us.”But according to captain and defensive lineman Carl Ehrlich, while the expectations may be the same as last year, the Harvard squad that must live up to them is not.“The thing that we’ve talked about on the team is winning an Ivy League Championship,” Ehrlich says. “There was a lot of feel that last year, when we had so many people coming back, we had [quarterback Chris] Pizzotti [’08-’09] coming back, all those people were coming back, that we were going to defend an Ivy League Championship. I think this year more than ever, new faces, new feel, completely new team, we’re really focused on winning our own. We’re not defending. It’s not the third championship we’re going to win. It’s a new team, we’re winning one championship.”The Crimson will get a good sense of its “new” team in its early contests, which feature two of its tougher opponents: Holy Cross in Week 1 and Brown in Week 2.No. 23 Holy Cross returns its two-time Patriot League Player of the Year quarterback, Dominic Randolph, who will likely be a top candidate to receive the conference honors for the third consecutive year.“Holy Cross, they may have their best team in the past 20 years,” Murphy says. “Obviously you have a quarterback who’s going for his third straight—these are unheard-of statistics—conference player of the year award…I’ve never heard of anything like that at any level.”As for Brown, it lost its star quarterback Michael Dougherty, but retains 10 of its regular starters, including six All-Ivy players—among them the feared wide receiver duo of Buddy Farnham and Bobby Sewall.“Brown’s good every year,” Murphy says. “They’re returning the nucleus of their football team, other than quarterback. They have more people returning than any other team I think in our league.”Harvard’s biggest question mark heading into tomorrow’s season opener at Holy Cross is unarguably at quarterback. But Murphy seems confident in his play callers, namely junior Collier Winters, who will be taking snaps in the opening drive. “Collier’s a natural athlete, a natural runner,” Murphy says, likening Winters to 2009 graduate Liam O’Hagan, who was the running counterpart to Pizzotti’s arm. “And he can throw the football.”Assisting Winters will be a deep veteran corps of receivers—led by senior Matt Luft—which will include a healthy senior Mike Cook, juniors Marco Iannuzzi and Chris Lorditch, and sophomore Adam Chrissis. With those targets, Murphy’s confident that Winters and the other quarterbacks will have no problem spreading the field.“On one hand, your offense goes as your quarterback goes, but your quarterback also only goes as good as his supporting cast,” Murphy says. “I think by having a relatively experienced offensive line group and receiving group, it’s going to make the transition a lot easier.”Providing a balance on the offense is the deep running back position. Junior Gino Gordon is looking to build on his superb sophomore season and, according to Murphy, is only getting better in preseason. Joining him is a healthy senior Cheng Ho, giving the Crimson no shortage of run options. To cap things off, Harvard has a true freshman that Ehrlich and Murphy believe will make waves from the get-go, Treavor Scales. “He has been outstanding, quite frankly, this preseason,” Murphy admits. “He is a kid who will play for us from day one.”“He came in, ran an unbelievable 40 time,” Ehrlich echoes. “He’s been doing a really good job, and he’ll definitely be getting time.”Defensively, the Crimson will inevitably miss the production it got from such talented 2009 graduates as Eric Schultz, Glenn Dorris, and Desmond Bryant, who is now with the Oakland Raiders. But according to Ehrlich, Harvard has plenty of players who have been waiting for their day to step in.“The timing works out perfectly,” Ehrlich says. “We graduated some guys, we have a pretty young team, but the way things are coming along…the way things have progressed from the first scrimmage to the second scrimmage to the Dartmouth scrimmage, we’re hitting on all cylinders.”And despite losing stud cornerback Andrew Berry ’09 to graduation, the Crimson believes the combination of last year’s Ivy Rookie of the Year Matthew Hanson, fifth-year senior Ryan Barnes, senior Derrick Barker, and junior Collin Zych should stack up against the league’s top receivers.“We have a really talented secondary, so if we can stop the run and force [opponents] to throw the ball, I’m really confident,” says senior defensive end Ryan Burkhead.But above all, this year’s Crimson squad is out to prove that it is its own team. Having lost its core of seniors to graduation, Murphy says the next group is ready to hit the ground running.“I have very high hopes,” Murphy says. “We’re setting the bar high…I think they’re talented guys. It’s just their time now.”—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The television show “American Idol” is an apt comparison for the situation facing the quarterback position on the Harvard football team. Not only does it allude to this season’s competition for the starting spot, but it also captures the spirit of the position. More so than pop singers, Crimson quarterbacks evoke an American ethos. The job requires a rare blend of intelligence, skill, and moxie to be a leader among many future leaders. To demand such proficiency in one individual is almost unfair, but each fall the Crimson does just that in naming a starting quarterback.
This season, Harvard’s prospective field generals face the pressure of replacing two All-Ivy performers in Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 and Liam O’Hagan ’08-’09, who were a combined 31-9 in games started over the course of their careers. The tandem led the Crimson to Ivy League championships in each of the last two seasons.
“They both played so well for so long,” sophomore quarterback Alex Sarkisian says, “but I think the quarterbacks we have now can step in and do a good job.”
Those quarterbacks include junior Collier Winters, junior Matt Simpson, freshman Colton Chapple, and Sarkisian. Heading into this weekend’s game against Holy Cross, Winters sits atop the depth chart, followed closely by Simpson, with Chapple and Sarkisian fighting for the third spot. 
“Simpson and [Winters] have been battling it out,” junior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi says. “[Simpson] had a minor ankle twist, and so that put him back a few practices. But when they’re healthy, it’s still a battle between the two.”  
Though the competition for the starting job has been fierce, it has not been divisive. Working out together in the offseason and sharing reps in practice has not only motivated each quarterback, it has allowed them to work together towards their collective improvement.
“If I ever have any questions about making reads on the field or protection checks or anything like that, [the other quarterbacks have] always been very helpful,” Sarkisian says. “I don’t think there’s any animosity between us at all.” 
“Competing for the spot makes everyone work harder and get better, but we’re all just friends having fun,” Winters adds. “We just like playing football and being around each other.”
Harvard’s quarterback play promises to be a little different this season than in years past.
While Pizzotti was primarily a pocket passer, this year’s crop of quarterbacks can all make things happen with their legs. 
“They’re all pretty similar in what they can do,” says senior wide receiver Matt Luft. “They all have pretty good arms, they all make good reads, and they can all move and get away from trouble if need be.”
As a result, the Crimson offense will feature more quarterback runs in its play calling, opening the possibility for Harvard to employ an exciting brand of football.
But the Crimson signal callers stress that the offense will depend on the players surrounding them, primarily the talented wide receiver corps. Including Luft and Iannuzzi, Harvard returns six of its top seven receivers from a year ago. Together, the group accounted for 2,150 yards and 15 touchdowns last season.
“We have so many weapons,” Sarkisian says. “It’s just incredible. We have a handful of guys who are All-Ivy caliber receivers. You combine all those receivers with a great offensive line and a great running game—that’s all you can ask for.”
“Our role, [for] the first couple games at least, is to manage the offense, take care of the ball, and just let the guys around us make all the plays,” Winters says.
But in spite of all their modesty, the challenge remains for the quarterbacks to lead the team in both action and attitude. 
“[Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s] main [expectation of the quarterbacks] is to be the leaders on the team,” Simpson says. “With Chris and Liam, they both had excellent leadership. People really looked to them to run the offense. So I think they have the same expectations for us.”
While the bar may be set high—especially in the wake of consecutive Ivy League championships—it only seems appropriate for someone as distinguished as a Harvard quarterback.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading tacklers and proven leaders—these are the factors that make the 2009 Harvard secondary a forceful unit, and the lynchpin of the Crimson defense.
In recent years, Harvard’s defensive backfield has consistently enjoyed talent, with All-American standouts Steven Williams ’08 and Andrew Berry ’09 joining skill players throughout the starting 11 to make the Crimson defense a formidable group.
“We’ve always had the best defense in the league,” senior cornerback Derrick Barker says. “[My] freshman and sophomore year, I know it was the best defense statistically as well as talent-wise.”
Indeed, Harvard led the Ivies in total defense in 2006 and 2007, notching a league-leading total of 15 interceptions in the latter season. 
But in 2008, it appeared that—for the first time in a while—the Crimson faithful had reason to worry. Harvard lost both Williams and defensive coordinator Kevin Doherty, and while Berry represented a known quantity at corner, the rest of the secondary—comprised of then-senior Ryan Barnes, then-junior Barker, then-sophomore Collin Zych, and rookie Matthew Hanson—presented a number of less-heralded new faces. With the exception of Berry, the Crimson’s defensive backs could claim only a handful of college starts.
“It was terrifying last year, just making sure not to let my team down,” Hanson says with a laugh as he recalls his first game. “I was looking at the Holy Cross film [from 2008], and I was playing like 20 yards deep every time making sure I didn’t get beat.”
The unit had a lot of question marks, and opponents knew it—among Ivy League squads, Harvard endured the second-highest number of pass attempts as teams strove to exploit its young defense. Instead, it was the Crimson that got the last laugh.
Rather than wither in the spotlight, Harvard’s new starters surpassed the achievements of their predecessors, holding opponents to 190.4 yards per game through the air—nearly seven yards better than the year before—and the league’s lowest opponent completion percentage, at only 53 percent.
Much of the secondary’s success stemmed from the youngsters’ enthusiasm and their ability to learn quickly on the job.
“I learned a lot over last season,” Zych says. “[Watching film], I was looking at myself like, ‘Man, I’ve come a long way.’ It was a great experience to just get out there finally and just have fun.”
The defense enjoyed itself plenty in 2008, finishing with a 10-0 smash-mouth victory over Yale. While Berry garnered first-team All-Ivy honors, his peers made tremendous impacts of their own. After overcoming his jitters, Hanson was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
Zych led the team with 48 solo tackles from his safety position, while Barker paced the squad with four interceptions and 10 pass breakups, starting all 10 games for the suddenly-dominant Crimson.
Barnes rounded out the Crimson’s starting four, saving the squad’s season with three memorable interceptions against Penn.
With such breakout performances, the 2008 secondary proved that it had no lack of talent. But this year’s squad has something extra—experience, both on the field and with each other.
“It’s always a challenge when you lose a defensive coordinator, or anybody for that matter...but last year I believe we adjusted very well,” Barker says. “This year we don’t have to deal with that adversity, we don’t have to deal with new starters really, and I think we’re going to be great.”
Considering that the unit has gelled so cohesively, the senior Barker and fifth-year senior Barnes do not see a need to adopt greater leadership roles, as the secondary has evolved together.
“We’ve been around a long time, and we know the system really well,” Barnes says. “This group has played a lot together, so really in terms of the secondary, as far as [leadership] goes, it hasn’t been a big deal at all.”
Harvard has reason to be confident—the four returnees accounted for nine of the Crimson’s 15 interceptions last year and totaled as many pass breakups (29) as the average Harvard opponent’s entire squad.
“Things are looking up,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “Our secondary has played very well in the preseason. I’ve been impressed and pleased.”
The coach’s endorsement is a reflection of the talent and potential of the returning core, in addition to talented prospects such as sophomore Danny Minimede and freshman Brian Owusu. As the secondary looks to build on a breakout 2008 campaign, Barker wants to ensure that no one underestimates the Crimson again.
“My goal is for people to fear us,” he says. “For quarterbacks, when they dream at night, to think about the Harvard secondary…I want people to be afraid.”

BROWN
After grabbing a share of the  Ivy title last year, Brown—like almost every other team in the league—has lost its starting quarterback. Junior Kyle Newhall Caballero has won the starting spot without ever throwing a varsity pass. But the Bears’ fearsome receiving duo of Buddy Farnham and Bobby Sewall is back and looking to improve on last year’s combined 1,764 yards. On the defensive end,  senior David Howard  leads a squad that gave up 19 points a game last year.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Bobby Sewall
COLUMBIA
Columbia crawled out of the league cellar with a 2-8 record in 2008, and the Lions return a number of key contributors on defense. Junior linebacker Alex Gross returns after leading the league in tackles a year ago, and senior Lou Mills paced the Ivies in sacks. Columbia is also one of the few teams to return its starting quarterback. Senior Shane Kelly will have his three top targets—Austin Knowlin, Taylor Joseph, and Mike Stephens— back as well.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Alex Gross
CORNELL
Another young team with an inexperienced quarterback, Cornell will try to replicate last year’s hot 3-0 start. The  Big Red faltered down the stretch, winning just one of its final seven games, and will be without graduated All-Ivy quarterback Nathan Ford.Senior Ben  Ganter will be taking the snaps, protected by an experienced offensive line led by senior Quentin Bernhard. The defense will be anchored by senior linebacker Chris Costello, who was third in the league in tackles in ‘08.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Randy Barbour
DARTMOUTH
Once again picked to finish in the basement of the Ivy League, Dartmouth  was outscored by an average of over 21 points a game last year. The good news for the Big Green is that its young squad has one more year of experience. Junior wide receiver Tim McManus will again be the top target in the air, coming off a season in which he hauled in 60 catches and earned All-Ivy honors. But the defense, which gave up an abysmal 455 yards a game in 2008, still needs some help.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Alex Jenny
HARVARD
Harvard’s biggest question is at quarterback, but junior Collier Winters will have plenty of experienced targets at receiver in his first collegiate start. The running corps remains fully intact from last year’s Ivy-leading offense. Defensively, the Crimson will have to contend with the loss of six All-Ivy starters, but a senior-heavy front seven and a seasoned secondary leaves Harvard in good shape against a league with few veteran quarterbacks.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Matt Luft
PENN
Picked second in the Ivies this season, Penn will be helmed by junior quarterback Keiffer Garton, who jumped from third to first on the depth chart towards the end of last year. Garton’s top target will be senior Kyle Derham, who led the team with 404 receiving yards in ’08. Kicker Andrew Samson returns after leading the league with 16 field goals. All-Ivy senior Chris Wynn anchors a unit that was second in the Ancient Eight in scoring defense.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Mike DiMaggio
PRINCETON
Though Princeton is once again picked to finish in the middle of the pack, one spot where the Tigers are ahead of the game is at running back. Senior Jordan Culbreath, a unanimous First-Team All-Ivy pick in ’08, is back after leading the league with 1,206 rushing yards. Princeton will have a new starting quarterback for the fourth consecutive year, with sophomore Tommy Wornham getting the snaps. Linebackers Scott Britton and Stephen Cody, who combined for 166 tackles last year, lead the D.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Jordan Culbreath
YALE
First-year coach Tom Williams has a battle at quarterback on his hands. Junior Brook Hart, who started five games last year, is the incumbent, but  sophomore transfer Patrick Witt has been seeing a lot of preseason action as well. Whoever earns the job will have some familiar faces at receiver, as the top three targets are all back. The Bulldogs also lost several key players from the defensive unit, which was tops in the Ivies with just 10.5 points allowed per game.
PLAYER TO WATCH: Jordan Forney

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Do work—that’s the motto the Harvard defense is living by this season.
And while the phrase may be derived from  MTV’s “Rob and Big,” it certainly seems to fit the Crimson’s situation. At first look, Harvard has a lot of work to do.
Five of last year’s starting tackles, ends, and linebackers have graduated, leaving the Crimson with a new look up front. 
Granted, Class of 2009 graduates Peter Ajayi, Desmond Bryant, Matt Curtis, Glenn Dorris, and Eric Schultz weren’t exactly your run-of-the-mill defense—all five received All-Ivy recognition in their senior season, propelling Harvard to a second-straight Ancient Eight title. 
But anchored by captain Carl Ehrlich and senior Conor Murphy—both holdovers from last year’s starting lineup—the Crimson’s goal is not to miss a beat.
“You have a lot of guys who maybe didn’t start a lot of games last year...but there’s really not as much of a lack of experience as it may appear,” senior Ryan Burkhead says. “There’s a lot of experience there, these guys have been biding their time.”
Burkhead, who will be starting at defensive end, is one of the newer faces on the line. He saw action in nine games last season, making 21 tackles (10 solo) and recording three sacks, but the adjustment to the role of starter will bring new responsibilities.
“There’s much more of a leadership role involved—you have all the younger guys asking you questions,” Burkhead says. “Last year, I felt like I really needed to be on top of everything, so that really hasn’t changed.”
Junior Ben Graeff has earned the other starting end position, and will also see a huge jump in his playing time after recording six tackles a year ago. 
“On any other team in the league, [he] would have gotten a lot of playing time last year,” Ehrlich says. “But we were so deep at defensive end.”
The duo will try to replicate the performance of Ajayi and Bryant, who combined for 54 tackles and both made the All-Ivy Second Team.
Ehrlich is a familiar face at tackle, returning to the spot he occupied on last year’s line. 
“That’s the cornerstone of our defense, our defense is all about stopping the run,” the captain says. “I plug some gaps, eat double teams in the middle. It’s part of defense, you take a double team and a linebacker comes through and makes a play...it’s kind of a hard-hat, workman-like mentality of stopping the run first, so I’m definitely trying to add to that.”
Junior Chucks Obi will also get the call at tackle. Obi played in all 10 games as a sophomore in 2007, with 25 total tackles and an All-Ivy Honorable Mention nod.
Though the defensive line is set, the situation at linebacker is not as clear-cut. 
Murphy will return as a starter, but Harvard has a host of seniors waiting in the wings to rotate through the linebacker slots.
Seniors Nick Hasselberg, JB Monu, and Sean Hayes will all be seeing a marked increase in playing time in their final seasons.
“To put in the time, working out all those times, practicing all those times, and never getting to play...it really bothers people,” Ehrlich says. “So these are all competitors, these are all awesome football players that came up and were a year behind Eric Schultz and Glenn Dorris—great linebackers. It makes you hungry, and maybe it’s cliché, but it makes you hungry. These guys, they’re ready to play, and they’re ready to make the most of their opportunity.”
Schultz and Dorris racked up five All-Ivy honors between them, with Schultz leading the team in both tackles (79) and sacks (4.5) last season. 
Now, the door is open for a group of determined seniors to prove its mettle. 
“We’ve got four or five seniors at those positions who know our system and are talented football players, and it’s just their turn,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy says.
Hasselberg and Hayes are currently battling for the starting position at weakside linebacker, while sophomore Alex Gedeon has won the job at middle linebacker. 
Though Harvard may have graduated a quintet of great defenders, the Crimson is confident that with speed, hunger, and hard work, it can return to form as one of the top defenses in the Ivies. 
“We’re not where we need to be, but we have the potential to be an outstanding defensive unit,” Murphy says. “When’s that going to happen? It’s not going to happen in the first quarter against Holy Cross, but we have that potential.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine, for a second, that instead of traveling to Holy Cross tomorrow to watch Harvard take on the Crusaders, you were one of over 30,000 fans packing into a maximum-capacity Harvard Stadium as the Crimson kicked off its season against a major-conference team, say, Boston College. It’s a pleasant thought, but the reality is far more complex.Fordham’s decision in June to begin awarding football scholarships starting with this year’s recruiting class piqued the interest of a lot of people in the Ivy League football community. The move shows a changing mentality in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly Division 1-AA), which includes the Ancient Eight.“It’s something we’re definitely keeping an eye on because if they go scholarships—we’re talking about the league now—it will change dramatically,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “The last time any Patriot League school had scholarships in that league was Holy Cross in the ’80s and ’90s. They dominated Eastern football at this level in a way that wasn’t seen before and hasn’t been seen since.”The Patriot League, which includes full members Bucknell, Colgate, Holy Cross, Lehigh, and Lafayette, as well as football-only members Fordham and Georgetown, is the conference most akin to the Ivy League and—since its establishment in 1986—has emulated the Ivy League philosophy regarding academics and athletics.“Our tradition and our history is to be need-based or need-limited in our awarding of financial aid, similar to the Ivy League,” notes Patriot League Director of Athletics Carolyn Femovitz. “However, the Patriot League in general has moved to scholarships in other sports...So the conversations have evolved over time in different ways on each of our campuses about whether or not...awarding scholarships in football would be appropriate for us to do as well.”And though the Patriot League is far from making a decision across the board regarding scholarships, the reasons seem clear for the personnel at Fordham.“We’re really being squeezed—all the Patriot League schools are being squeezed from two ends,” says Fordham Director of Athletics Frank McLaughlin, who was Harvard’s men’s basketball coach from 1977-85. “One is, you can’t get anybody away from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or the Ivies. You know, with Harvard, Yale, Princeton increasing their aid packages, I think you’re going to see a tremendous boost across the board athletically at all three schools. And then the Northeast Conference, the Monmouths, the Wagners, Central Connecticut and stuff, they’re giving scholarships.”True, Harvard’s increased financial aid package may offer a benefit equivalent to that of athletic scholarships at other schools, but the perks of offering formal athletic scholarships extend beyond being able to recruit better athletes.According to NCAA legislation, Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly Division 1-A) schools are permitted the opportunity to schedule one FCS opponent a year and count that contest as a bowl-eligible game—if the FCS team offers 57 athletic scholarships on average over the previous two years.“That’s how they looked at it,” Murphy says of Fordham. “The going rate those schools will give you to play, probably the median is somewhere around half a million dollars. So if you can know that you’re going to get half a million dollars with one FBS game, then you can make the numbers work.”So with its sister conference seemingly headed down a path towards athletic scholarships, is the Ivy League close behind?“It will never happen in our league, and it shouldn’t,” Murphy says. “It’s not appropriate, because every kid here has something a little bit special about them. I think while in a certain world you might think that might be great for Harvard football, I think anything you do to try to distinguish athletes as being different from other students would not be a good thing.”The Ivy League’s resistance to handing out athletic scholarships is motivated by the conference’s understanding of its unique role in collegiate football. According to Murphy, the Ivy League is clear in its pursuit to educate those who deserve it most, whether it’s on the field or in the classroom. And by extending financial aid to a young person who’s intellectually curious, not just because he can kick a ball through the uprights from over 50 yards out, the Ancient Eight is continuing its long-standing tradition of asking more from its students.But if the Patriot League does step up the quality of its recruits, then necessary alterations will inevitably have to be made to Harvard’s non-conference schedule.“We’ll have to adjust for sure,” Murphy admits, adding that the decision to schedule Fordham in an upcoming season was made “before we knew they were going to scholarships.”Despite not being a viable candidate for any FBS opposition, Harvard is looking to make the most of its non-conference schedule. Realizing the nationwide clout that the Harvard name carries, Murphy is looking to expand the field of competition beyond the Northeast for alumni- and recruiting-related reasons. The University of San Diego is just one of the many new names on the Crimson’s upcoming schedule.“Southern California’s become such a big Ivy League recruiting area,” Murphy says. “California in general—and not just for football, but for all sports, for the general student body. We’re also going to be down in D.C. against Georgetown. Those are games that make sense to us, even though they might cost a little more in terms of travel.”So it appears that a matchup with the cross-town Eagles remains just a pipe dream, and a cross-country battle against the Toreros will have to suffice. But when the Ivy League was established in 1954, the Ancient Eight presidents set clear standards regarding the nature of athletics in their schools. For now, at least, it seems those philosophical ideals will remain intact.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

HARVARD vs. PENNPencil in November 14 on your calendars—the clash between Harvard and Penn in Cambridge will likely have major implications in the Ivy League title race, as the Crimson and the Quakers were picked to finish 1-2 in the Ancient Eight in the preseason media poll. Last year, Harvard squeaked out a win at Franklin Field on the strength of three Ryan Barnes interceptions, but dynamic Penn quarterback Keiffer Garton will have a full season of experience under his belt this time around. Harvard’s new-look defense will have to play better than it did last year—when the Quakers recorded a season-high 445 yards—to win.BROWN RECEIVERS vs. HARVARD SECONDARYBrown’s Killer B’s—senior wide receivers Bobby Sewall and Buddy Farnham—are back, and will look to terrorize the Harvard secondary in a key Week 2 tussle. Sewall led the Ancient Eight in receptions (69), receiving yards (948), and receiving touchdowns (8) last year, and Farnham was not far behind. The pair will be catching passes from inexperienced quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero, but they will still provide a challenge for the Crimson backs. Harvard returns three starters in the secondary, along with reigning Rookie of the Year Matt Hanson, and should improve on last year’s third-ranked pass defense.TIM MURPHY vs. TOM WILLIAMSWhen Yale coach Jack Siedlecki stepped down last year, there’s no doubt that a large part of the decision had to do with the Bulldogs’ recent misfortune against archrival Harvard. Murphy is 10-5 against Yale and has led the Crimson to victory in The Game in seven of the last eight years. Williams, a former assistant coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, will have his work cut out for him this season. While Harvard is picked to win the Ivy title for the third straight year, the Bulldogs are projected to be a middle-of-the-pack team, and the graduation of star running back Mike McLeod should make the Crimson the favorite when the teams clash in New Haven.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Marco Iannuzzi is no stranger to overcoming obstacles. In fact, it’s what he’s been doing all his life. Now a junior, the wide receiver has cemented his place as one of Harvard football’s top offensive threats, but getting there wasn’t always easy. Growing up in Calgary, Alberta, Iannuzzi’s abilities didn’t always turn heads. “He was always very small, and then all of a sudden he just grew to become this tremendously talented athlete,” says Joe Stambene, Iannuzzi’s coach at St. Francis High School. As high school progressed, the speedy receiver blossomed into one of the more promising recruits in Canada. Harvard came knocking, and Iannuzzi immediately knew it was the place for him. “I remember I was on a trip in Mexico with some friends and to embarrass me, some of my friends started telling people around that I might be going to Harvard,” Iannuzzi says. “Random people, who didn’t even know English, knew what Harvard was, so I knew right away that it wasn’t just number one for me, it was number one for everyone.” Though the decision on Iannuzzi’s end was an easy one, the Harvard admissions office didn’t feel the same way. When he applied straight out of high school, he was denied acceptance. But Iannuzzi was not deterred, and he spent the year playing semi-pro football with the Edmonton Huskies while taking correspondence classes. “Athletically, I wouldn’t trade the semi-pro year,” Iannuzzi says. “I got to do an internship where I was managing a restaurant...I think the real world experiences are where I gained the most. The jobs I had, the people I met, the connections I made.” Iannuzzi once again sent in an application to Harvard, and again he was disappointed. This time, he was directed to Western Reserve Academy, a prep school in Ohio, and told to reapply the next year. But Iannuzzi stayed determined, and spent the year building up his academic profile. “Through those three years of trying to get in, [Crimson coach Tim Murphy] believed in me the whole time,” Iannuzzi says. “Not only helping me to get in in terms of [getting] on people in admissions, he told me what to do in terms of, ‘Take this in school, try to better yourself in this aspect.’ He believed in me this whole time and never gave up. And it never crossed my mind to give up.” The third time proved to be the charm for the Canadian—in 2007, he finally gained acceptance to the College. “You will never find someone as focused as that kid,” Stambene says. “Once Harvard was set as a goal, there was never a question of getting there—that was always going to happen. He just went a roundabout way, but he never took his eyes off that prize.” Iannuzzi made an immediate impact with the Crimson in his rookie season, seeing time at wide receiver as well as on special teams as a kick returner. In 2008, when he won a starting spot at wide receiver coming out of preseason, Iannuzzi proved that he belonged, catching 11 passes for 174 yards in the season opener against Holy Cross. But his promising sophomore campaign was cut short when he broke his collarbone in Harvard’s 24-22 second-week loss at Brown. “It’s frustrating, but it’s part of the game,” Iannuzzi says. “[It’s hard] standing on the sidelines, but instead of going to practice every day and running, you’re going to the training room and getting things done. And you’re still in it mentally, watching the game.” Iannuzzi returned in time to play Yale, hauling in a 39-yard pass in Harvard’s title-clinching 10-0 win. Now heading into the 2009 season, Iannuzzi is part of a strong group of returning receivers, including seniors Matt Luft and Mike Cook and juniors Chris Lorditch and Levi Richards. “[Iannuzzi] gives you a speed element and a maturity element that anybody would love to have on their offense, but he also gives us really good return capabilities,” Murphy says. “He’s an outstanding punt and kick returner, so that’s a big help because those guys are in high demand and short supply.” But Iannuzzi will be faced with a different challenge this season—that of balancing football and family. Iannuzzi and his girlfriend of five years, Jenn, were married on July 11. They now live off-campus with their 18-month-old daughter, Isla. “[Isla’s] a maniac, running around, getting into everything these days,” Iannuzzi says. “It’s been awesome, just the different phase change in life this past year. A lot of planning for the wedding, and planning for moving, and trying to childproof a house. New challenges, but they are just awesome.” And though Iannuzzi remains focused on football—after graduation, he hopes to play in either the CFL or NFL before pursuing a career as an architect—his life has been restructured to make more time for his family. “It’s just [that] your free time doesn’t go to hanging out with friends and going to play basketball at the gym,” Iannuzzi says. “You’re spending your free time with your family, and I find that I obviously try to make more free time for myself now...I make time for my studies, and that allows me to open up mornings to go to Home Depot and fun stuff like that.” His ability to strike a balance has earned the junior the respect of his teammates. “I was bragging to him that I got up 15 minutes early every morning to check the news during camp, and he started telling me about heating up milk and changing diapers before he came to practice—that’s the last time I bragged about getting up early,” captain Carl Ehrlich says. “He’s building a life in Boston with his family while doing all of that, and I don’t think that one has ever taken away from the other,” Ehrlich continues. But whether it’s catching passes or chasing his daughter around the house, Iannuzzi is up for the challenge. “When he was younger he wasn’t maybe the most talented,” Stambene says. “But if there’s anything I’ve learned about Marco over the years, it’s that hard work can and does get you where you need to get to in life.” —Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

Once a Lowellian, always a Lowellian.
Retired Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter '61 appeared yesterday at a Constitution Day panel discussion titled "The U.S. Constitution: What Should We Celebrate and What Should We Criticize?"
FlyBy couln't help but notice that Justice Souter--who turned 70 yesterday-- had traded in his somber black robe for a snappy Lowell House tie.
Besides weighing in on a discussion on judicial philosophy, Justice Souter reminisced on lectures he had attended in Emerson Hall--where yesterday's event occurred-- and named English Professor Louis Menand as a personal hero of his.
Following the three-hour event, the birthday boy made his way over to the Masters' Tea at Lowell House, joking that his tie was actually his "ticket" into his old home, which he vists when in town.
