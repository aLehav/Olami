After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting just behind first place in the giant slalom of the NCAA Championships, some athletes might have been nervous.
Harvard sophomore Rebecca Nadler was fired up.
“I think Rebecca is single-minded in purpose,” her father Steven said. “When she makes up her mind, she’s going to do everything possible to get there.”
And so Nadler did exactly what she did on the first run: execute the race plan perfectly and lock up the first-ever national title by a Crimson skier in the process.
“The number of congratulations we got from almost everyone there—the number of congratulations I got—I’ve never seen anything to this degree,” coach Tim Mitchell said. “People who have no connection to Harvard skiing, people from competitor programs.... It’s probably one of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had as a coach or competitor. I’ve never seen anything like it. It was just absolutely amazing.”
The trip to Bridger Bowl in Bozeman, Mont., meant a sharp change in conditions for the lifelong Easterner who grew up in Ottawa, Ont., and skied for the Quebec provincial team and Maine’s Carrabassett Valley Academy in her two years before Harvard. But Nadler had no trouble adjusting to the softer snow of the west.
“You still want to ski very aggressively, but you also don’t want to dig in too much,” Mitchell explained. “We made the[ski] edges a little duller at the back end so the skis didn’t dig in and grind.”
The conditions also meant that Nadler had to let go of her aggressive skiing style and focus on conquering the course rather than the opposition.
“I can’t stress enough how well she executed,” Mitchell said. “It was literally 100 percent, spot-on every turn. She completely, completely nailed it. It’s kind of hard not to think about the win. To have the focus and determination to remove yourself from focusing on the result to focusing on the process...it was tremendous.”
“I was just trying to be patient and keep a good line, not jamming the ski under the gate,” Nadler said. “I was trying to bring over the things I’d been doing well in practice [like] having that long outside leg.”
Nadler’s title was only the latest and greatest in what have been many firsts for the Crimson alpine ski team. Recently, Nadler gave Harvard its first EISA carnival win in an alpine event, and last year, she and then-sophomore Catherine Sheils were the first Crimson alpine skiers ever to go to NCAAs.
At that event, Nadler was within striking distance of the EISA individual points trophy, holding the lead heading into the championship weekend when the University of Vermont’s Kate Ryley snatched it away.
Nadler exacted her retribution on Thursday by edging her new rival out by .38 seconds for the victory.
“She shares her successes but takes responsibility for her failures,” Roanne Nadler said of her daughter. “She will just dig in and work a little harder.”
“Rebecca has a favorite quote: ‘You can never fail until you stop trying,’” Steven added.
Nadler’s resilience has come in handy throughout her career, which hasn’t always played out according to plan. Nadler didn’t come to Carrabassett Valley Academy until her run at the Canadian national team fell short. While competing for Carrabassett, she was a dark horse candidate who wasn’t being recruited by the EISA ’s top dogs. Her visibility increased when she won the Eastern Cup that winter.
At Harvard, Nadler has had her share of obstacles even beyond those that come with the time strains of competing for a school from Boston. After a promising start to her freshman season and a 21st place finish at the World University Games, Nadler was hindered with illness and injuries for much of her rookie campaign but was able to rally in time for a 20th place finish in the giant slalom at the NCAA Championships.
This year Nadler simply took her skiing to a new level.
“Winning a national championship—it doesn’t get any bigger than that,” Mitchell said. “At the same time, it’s not unbelievable. I know what she’s capable of. I know how hard she works.” 
The victory secured Nadler’s place as the Crimson’s best skier ever.
“I’m just overall a mess with how happy I am,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 12 past overtime games, the Harvard men’s hockey team has had plenty of experience with the extra period. But this time, one thing was different—ties were not allowed.
Not winning any one of those 12 OT games over the course of the season, the Crimson continued its streak Friday night, suffering a 2-1 loss in the first game of the ECAC quarterfinal playoffs against rival Yale at the Bright Hockey Center.
3:49 into overtime, Bulldog forward Kenny Agostino found himself open on the right side of the net after a pass from Antoine Laganiere. After pausing for a split-second as he gathered the puck, Agostino buried a shot past sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard on the far high side, winning the game for Yale (16-14-3, 10-10-2 ECAC) and giving the visitors a 1-0 advantage in the best-of-three series.
“We’re disappointed in the result,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They looked like the quicker team, they came up with a lot of loose pucks, [and] we gave up far too many out-numbered rushes and scoring chances against.”
One bright spot for the Crimson was Girard, who played well throughout, keeping the third-seeded Harvard (10-9-11, 8-5-9) within striking distance all night by saving 42 of the Bulldogs’ 44 shots.
“It’s playoff time,” Girard said. “If you want to go a long time down the road, you got to have a good goalie. I’m from Montreal, and I always look at Patrick Roy in [1986]. He just carried the whole team to the Stanley Cup, and that’s what you got to do.”
“Girard was outstanding,” Donato added. “He gave us a chance to have a few looks to win the game.”
In its first game in two weeks after earning a first-round bye, the Crimson showed some rust, especially in the first two periods, against the quick sixth-seeded Yale squad.
The beginning of the game had all the intensity of the postseason, with the home team delivering some big hits with its physical play. But Harvard could not generate many quality scoring chances.
“[Bulldog goaltender Nick] Maricic was solid,” Donato said. “But I don’t think we created enough traffic in front of him.”
The visitors jumped out to a 1-0 lead late in the first. A shot from the left point was initially saved by Girard and tipped in front of the net a few times before ultimately being put back in by freshman Trent Ruffolo.
Despite being outshot, 28-16, in the first two periods (14-8 in each), Harvard managed to knot the score at one right before the second period came to a close.
With under 30 seconds remaining, junior Luke Greiner netted the equalizer on a put-back from junior Danny Biega’s initial shot from the right point. Senior Eric Kroshus assisted on the play as well, keeping the puck in the offensive zone and passing it over to Biega.
“The goal in the second gave us a good boost going into the third because I don’t think we played all that well in the first 40 minutes,” Donato said.
Harvard stepped up its play in the final frame but was unable to find the back of the net on one of its 14 shots. Freshman Colin Blackwell had an opportunity near the net on the right after a pass across from Kroshus left him in good position, but his shot sailed wide left.
“In the third period, I thought we were pretty solid,” Donato said. “I thought as the game wore on, we started to get a little more comfortable and started to possess the puck a little bit more.”
Finally, in overtime, after failing to convert on an odd man rush, Yale was able to counter and score the game winner.
Overall, the Bulldogs outshot the Crimson, 44-33, while both teams were unsuccessful on the power play. Yale went zero for three while the Crimson, owner of second best power play in the nation, was zero for two, with one of the man-advantages only lasting 18 seconds. Each team won 35 face-offs.
Harvard now faces elimination Saturday night as the Bulldogs try to pull off the upset and sweep the series.
“We’ll have to play much better if we want to have the result we want tomorrow,” Donato said.
