After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crimson FM Chair Mark J. Chiusano offers the fan's perspective on last Saturday's loss to Princeton.
II.
Sometime in the first half, there is a play when Brandyn Curry, one of the explosive, intensely shouldered guards who has what is called fast-twitch muscles, finds himself hopscotched in the corner, surrounded by Princeton fans all in orange.  You can’t see him from the Harvard stands but you can see the Princeton players beginning to collapse on him, sensing fear, and then you see him muscle the ball towards the hoop on a line with one hand, and Kyle Casey is there in midair above the prized Princeton center slamming it in, and at this point it puts Harvard up by five.
There is a tall boy in the stands who looks like he would be a senior, or someone recently graduated.  He’s wearing a velvet suit jacket dyed crimson and a flared white dress shirt and a crimson bowtie.  He has a menagerie of signs, including one that says “Cornell West doesn’t publish,” another, “Eating Clubs: Still Misogynist.” A reporter from Bloomberg News comes over at halftime to ask to see the signs and I think about asking her if she worked for Bloomberg News, as a means of entry into conversation.  I hold one of the signs up so she can take a picture of it, and when the tall boy who made the signs comes back I try to tell him a Bloomberg News reporter took a picture of the signs, but he thinks I’m complimenting him on his bowtie, and he straightens it and gives me a thumbs up.
Number 33 on Princeton is their point guard, and while he’s not as fast or athletic as the Harvard guards, he does have a nice jumper, and he gets around picks at the top of the key well.  Everyone knows that his mother was on “Baywatch” in 1996, and perhaps he has his mothers’ looks, although a bit of a pretty boy for a basketball court.  This goes for much of the Princeton team, which seems prettier and more homegrown than should be possible.  Harvard looks hungrier, younger and more scraggly.  They have facial hair, for instance.  I remember that someone once did a study on stereotypes that people have when they watch teams wearing black.  Harvard has its away uniforms on, and the crimson lettering reflects in the black.  Number 33 has dirty blond hair and sticks out among the black uniforms when he is surrounded by traps in the corners.  The Harvard fans chant “‘Baywatch’” when he has the ball, and it seems to bother him.  Once he hits a three and puts a finger to his lips as if for quiet.  Later he airballs a shot and then whenever he gets the ball the Harvard crowd chants “Airball, airball.”
At halftime the ESPN reporter, Schaap on ESPN, starts to do a little spot, for his couple seconds on national TV.  The student crowds on both sides try to surge sideways a bit to get in the background.  When he finishes his cameraman tries to get away too quickly, and the cord rips the microphone out of Schaap’s hand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team continued its spring break road trip Tuesday, splitting its two games at the Marina International Hotel Showcase in Los Angeles.
The Crimson was a strike away from winning its first game against Wisconsin, when the opposition made a stunning four-run comeback to win, 5-2. Harvard came back fired up in their second game and defeated Loyola Marymount, 4-1.
Co-captain Ellen Macadam continued to be a driving force, extending her hitting streak to 10 games. She currently leads the Ivy League in hits and total bases and is second in runs scored, home runs, and slugging percentage.
"Ellen has just been a stud," junior pitcher Rachel Brown said. "We look to her to get rallies going, and we all have so much confidence in her at the plate. She's had an incredible start to the season, and it's really exciting to watch her play."
HARVARD 4, LOYOLA 1
In its second game of the day, Harvard (7-4) was pitted against the tournament hosts, Loyola Marymount (7-13).
Despite taking an early 1-0 lead in the second inning, the Lions were unable to fend off the Crimson, which came back in the next inning to score three runs and grab the lead.
Senior Emily Henderson started things off with a walk and was followed by Macadam, who reached first due to a throwing error. Harvard's first run of the game came shortly after, when sophomore Ashley Heritage doubled down the left field line to bring in Henderson.
A few batters later, freshman Kasey Lange's sacrifice fly brought home Macadam, and sophomore Stephanie Regan knocked in Heritage with a single.
In the fourth inning, junior Mari Zumbro slammed in a solo home run-her first of the season-to bring the Crimson's lead to three runs. Harvard held onto its advantage throughout the last three innings and ultimately won the game, 4-1.
This victory marked the first collegiate win for freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who struck out five batters and allowed for only one run on seven hits.
"Laura pitched a great game, especially after giving up that home run in the beginning," junior Whitney Shaw said. "She showed great composure and was really able to shut them down after that. She just took the game pitch by pitch and totally had their number. She was a huge factor in our win."
WISCONSIN 5, HARVARD 2
The Crimson held a 2-1 lead for most of its first game against Wisconsin (9-7), but the squad ultimately suffered a heartbreaking loss when the Badgers—down to their last strike—scored four runs in the seventh inning.
The game began quietly, with no scoring until the third inning, when a Wisconsin batter singled and then came home on a Harvard error.
But the visitors made an exciting comeback in the next inning with consecutive solo home runs by Shaw and Lange.
The Crimson held onto its 2-1 lead for nearly the remainder of the contest and was one strike away from victory, when the Badger's Stephanie Peace smashed a three-run home run to give Wisconsin a 4-2 lead. An insurance run then brought home Badger Jennifer Kruger, and Harvard, unable to score in the bottom of the seventh, lost, 5-2.
It was the first loss of the year for Brown who, before yesterday, had pitched the Crimson to all six of its victories.
"Rachel was outstanding for us," Macadam said. "Wisconsin just really stole the game from us in the end. But it was a really good game, a tough battle. We stuck with them and had them for a long time, but they just stole it back from us in the bottom of the seventh with two outs, two strikes. It was a tough loss."
The Crimson has a chance to redeem itself this Thursday when it faces off against Wisconsin in its first game at the San Diego Classic II.
"We're so excited we get to play Wisconsin again," Macadam said. "We had them beat for the majority of the game, and now we know we can play with them absolutely. We know what we're up against, and we know we can beat them."
