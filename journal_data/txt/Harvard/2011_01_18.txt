Julianne Moore—star of films such as “Boogie Nights,” “The Big Lebowski,” and “The Kids Are All Right”—has been named Hasty Pudding’s 2011 Woman of the Year, according to a press release issued today.
“We’re very excited,” Hasty Pudding spokesperson Learah T. Lockhart ’12 said of the pick.
The Pudding selected Moore, also known for her recurring role in the popular television show “30 Rock,” for her diverse accomplishments and wide range of acting experience, according to  Lockhart.
“Julianne Moore has made a lot of bold choices in her career,” said Lockhart. “She has acted in everything from movies to independent films to theater to television. She has even authored two children’s books.”
Lockhart added that the Pudding was also impressed by Moore’s academic achievements. She is a graduate of Boston University’s College of the Fine Arts.
Moore will be honored in a parade that will move from the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Plympton Street to the New College Theater at 12 Holyoke St. on Jan. 27 at 2:30 p.m.
Following the parade, Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Michael A. Barron ’11 and Vice President of Cast Kyle J. Dancewicz ’11 will roast Moore, a four-time Oscar nominee, and then present her with her Pudding Pot.
Moore began her acting career in 1983 after moving to New York City where she worked extensively. She made her television debut on the daytime soap opera “As the World Turns” and made her debut on the silver screen with her role in 1990’s “Tales from the Darkside: The Movie.”
Moore took on her first big screen leading role in the 1995 movie “Safe,” which earned her critical acclaim.
She received Golden Globe and British Academy of Film and Telvison Arts nominations for her most recent film “The Kids are All Right.” In that film, co-starring with Annette Bening, she played a lesbian mother of two children who meet their biological father.
She will next appear in the film “Crazy Stupid Love”—opposite Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling—and “Shelter,” also starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.
Anne J. Hathaway was the 2010 Woman of the Year. Previous Woman of the Year honorees include Meryl Streep, Katharine Hepburn, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster, and Elizabeth Taylor.
The Pudding also selects a Man of the Year. This year’s recipient will be announced next week, according to the press release. The event for the Man of the Year will be held Feb. 4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
George Washington was known for his military prowess.  It was fitting, then, that the Harvard men’s basketball team’s contest with the school named after the first president would turn into quite the war.
In the end, the Crimson (12-3, 1-0 Ivy) emerged victorious against George Washington (10-7), 67-62, but—like Washington’s battles—victory did not come without loss. The Crimson’s two top scorers, junior co-captain Keith Wright and sophomore Christian Webster, succumbed to injury in the process.
“I thought it was a really tough effort by our team because we lost two of our best players for essentially the entire second half,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “We knew we needed a lot of people to step in…and for people to step up and do a little more than they were used to.”
McNally and freshman Laurent Rivard picked up the scoring slack with 16 points each, while sophomore Kyle Casey chipped in 10 points and a career-high 15 rebounds.
“It was definitely a tough game, a physical game,” sophomore guard Brandyn Curry said. “They like to press, keep the tempo up. We like to play with a fast tempo too, so going in I knew it was going to be a fast game with a lot of intensity.”
The Colonials raced out to an 8-2 lead after a string of Harvard turnovers, capped by a layup by GW sophomore Bryan Byrnes.  But Byrnes turned the ball over the next time down, and Wright finished with a dunk at the other end to halt the Colonial momentum.  A Webster three from the corner on Harvard’s next possession brought the Crimson within one five minutes into the opening half.
The teams went back and forth for ten minutes, until GW began to pull away.  With the game tied at 18, the Colonials went on a 10-2 run highlighted by back-to-back three pointers by freshman Nemanja Mikic.
The lead held for the final three minutes of the period, and a Wright free throw with one second remaining made the score 33-26 in GW's favor heading into halftime.
But the Crimson would go on to dominate the second half, shooting 52.4 percent from the field and outscoring the Colonials, 41-29.
A Byrnes jumper to open the period stretched the GW lead to nine, but Rivard responded with a three on the other end to cut the lead to six.  He would do the same thing a few minutes later, when—after a Dwayne Smith layup pushed the GW lead to eight at 39-31—the sharpshooter drilled another longball to quell the Colonial momentum.
“We never really got ahead of ourselves and tried to do too much,” McNally said. “We just tried to chip at [the lead].”
GW held a small advantage for the next five minutes, with Harvard unable to pull closer than four.  With 11:40 remaining, Casey grabbed an offensive rebound off a missed three pointer by junior Andrew Van Nest and kicked it out to McNally, who buried a trey to cut the Colonial lead to three.
“I knew I needed to do a little bit more than I’m used to doing [after the injuries to Webster and Wright],” McNally said.
Byrnes responded with a three of his own to push the lead back to 48-42 with ten minutes left, but the Crimson would not go away. Rivard knocked down a jumper and Casey hit an and-one layup on Harvard’s next two possessions to cut the margin down to one.  After a basket by GW’s Daymon Warren, a Rivard trey tied the game at 50 with 8:41 remaining.
Casey then gave Harvard its first lead since 7:26 of the first half with a layup after a Taylor turnover, and a McNally three a minute later would put Harvard up, 55-51.
The Crimson wouldn’t relinquish its lead for the rest of the game, with GW never pulling within less than two.  Up 62-60 with a minute to go, Casey hit a layup and McNally came up with a big steal off of Taylor.  The co-captain dished the ball out to Curry, who was fouled and hit one free throw to give Harvard a five-point lead.
“Taylor was a really tough driver,” McNally said. “He was a pretty tough guy to guard. [But] he let down for that one play, and Brandyn did a good job making free throws down the stretch.”
Two free throws by Byrnes with 17 seconds remaining pulled the Colonials within three, but McNally—second in the nation in free-throw percentage at 94.3 percent—iced the game with two free throws of his own to give Harvard the 67-62 win.
It was the fifth straight win for the Crimson, who finished its nonconference schedule with momentum heading into Ivy play.  But the victory was not without loss, as Webster—who is from the DC area and whose father played at GW—and Wright left with injury.
Curry said he thought both were day-to-day. Though the injuries were a setback to the game plan, Curry and McNally were both proud of their teammates’ ability to step up to the challenge.
“It was a really good win for us,” McNally said. “Especially on the road against a good team.”
“I think it shows how deep our team can be,” Curry added. “We got big minutes from Ugo [Okam], [Andrew Van] Nest, and Matt Brown.  Those guys came in and gave us great minutes all around.  It was really a team victory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As snow laid on the ground on a chilly Saturday night in Boston, the Harvard men’s hockey team stayed even colder, dropping a 5-2 contest to its local rival, No. 16 Boston University, at Agganis Arena.
Junior forward Chris Connolly had two goals for the Terriers (10-5-6, 7-3-4 Hockey East), who beat the Crimson (3-12-0, 2-9 ECAC) for the third consecutive time, handing Harvard its eleventh loss in 12 contests.
“It was a close game until a certain point, when they got a few goals in a row,” senior defenseman Chris Huxley said. “It was kind of a buzz-kill; we didn’t really play our best.”
Both teams had good chances to score early in the first period but were unable to convert.
Sophomore forward Luke Greiner had an opportunity for Harvard when he redirected classmate Danny Biega’s point shot past BU goalie Kieran Millan, but the puck deflected off the right post.
Soon after, the Terriers’ Alex Chiasson had a good look from the slot, but the forward was denied by Crimson assistant captain goaltender Kyle Richter, who made a save with his left arm.
BU got on the board 11:41 into the opening frame after Harvard freshman defenseman Danny Fick was called for holding, giving the Terriers their first power play of the game. Connolly put the man-advantage to good use, taking a pass from teammate Adam Clendening and sending a one-timer past Richter from the right circle to put his team up, 1-0.
“We can’t control [penalties] completely,” Huxley said. “We just have to try to be careful and be more disciplined.”
The Terriers scored again just under two minutes into the second, when—after consecutive saves from Richter—BU’s Wade Megan put his third attempt over the goalie’s left shoulder to double the Terrier lead.
But just over two minutes later, Harvard sophomore Marshall Everson cut the advantage in half. Senior Michael Biega picked up a rebound of a Fick shot and sent a cross-ice pass to Everson, who hit the post with his first attempt before putting in his own rebound.
“Mike Biega picked it up in the slot, he made an unreal pass, and I was wide-open on the back side,” Everson said. “He saw me between three or four guys—I don’t know how he did it. I just hit the pipe, and then I was able to get an empty net.”
Thirteen-and-a-half minutes into the frame, the Crimson got a chance on a power play after Megan was called for hooking. But Connolly was able to intercept a Harvard pass at center ice and beat Richter on a breakaway with a high wrister to extend the Terrier lead to 3-1. It was the first shorthanded goal Harvard has allowed this season.
“[Turnovers are] something we’ve stressed all year,” Everson said. “They definitely hurt us Saturday night. From now on, we’ve just got to make our guys more wary of certain passes...you have to make the safe play sometimes over the risky one; otherwise it will lead to goals like that.”
Connolly, who has eight goals on the season, continued to challenge Richter as the period wore down, but the senior goaltender made two saves on the forward at the end of the frame to keep the Crimson within striking distance.
But just 23 seconds in the third period, Richter was scored on again, this time by BU forward Joe Pereira. The senior stole the puck from a Crimson defender in the Harvard zone and beat Richter from right outside the crease—while flying into the goaltender—to make the score 4-1.
“Early in the third we didn’t get the breaks we needed to start a comeback, and things just kind of snowballed for the rest of that period,” Everson said.
Harvard then squandered an offensive opportunity of its own. Terrier freshman Garrett Noonan was called for an extended penalty for game misconduct after elbowing a Harvard player in the head, but the Crimson was called for a too-many-men-on-the-ice infraction three minutes into the ensuing power play, causing it to lose its advantage.
BU extended its lead to 5-1 8:04 into the period, when Terrier sophomore Justin Courtnall initiated a give-and-go with teammate Patrick MacGregor and snuck the puck past Richter on a wraparound from the left side.
“I think there were more breakdowns than usual defensively,” Huxley said. “Usually we do a pretty solid job back there, but I felt like we made more mistakes than we usually do.”
Two minutes later, Harvard defenseman Ryan Grimshaw cut the lead to 5-2 when he took successive passes from Michael Biega and sophomore Alex Killorn and backhanded the puck past Millan.
But that would be the closest the Crimson would get. Richter finished with 32 saves in the losing effort, while Millan had 31 saves for BU. Junior Rence Coassin and Michael Biega led Harvard with five shots apiece, while Connolly finished with a team-leading eight for the Terriers.
“I didn’t feel like we played our best game,” Everson said. “To play a team of that caliber and go down 2-0 in the first, it’s tough to make a comeback.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her first giant slalom race on the collegiate carnival circuit, rookie Rebecca Nadler was nearly unbeatable—only three University of Vermont skiers were able to top her in the event.
Nadler's historic fourth-place finish helped lead the women's alpine squad to a fourth-place team finish in the event just a day after the alpine skiers had finished fifth in the slalom. The strong efforts of the women's alpine team paced the Harvard ski team to an eighth place overall finish at the St. Lawrence Carnival.
"The women [alpine skiers] had their best results in probably 35 years," said Crimson alpine coach Tim Mitchell. "Everybody knew [Nadler] was fast. I don't think anybody [outside of the team] knew she was going to be that fast...it definitely caught a lot of other teams by surprise."
But Mitchell said he wasn't surprised by the performance of Nadler, who will compete at the World University Games.
"I've been very confident that she can ski at that level...It was nice that it came that early."
Also posting a strong finish on the slopes was sophomore Catherine Sheils, who finished 14th in the giant slalom.
"She had a so-so first run but an excellent second run," Mitchell said. "That (second run) really moved her up.
The women's results were particularly impressive given that the squad only has four healthy female alpine skiers.
Meanwhile, the men's alpine team finished ninth in both the slalom and giant slalom events.
"The men skied pretty well," Mitchell said. "Everyone had at least one good finish. The consistency is getting better, and the men are getting much closer. Hopefully we're getting some momentum heading into the Colby Carnival.
The Nordic squad was less than satisfied with its performance. The nordic women finished ninth in both events, while the men took seventh in each event.
"I think the results were not up to expectations...I think nationals were a bit of a drain, and I'm not sure we had completely recharged," said Nordic coach Chris City '94. "This is week is nice; we're at home and we've got a bit of time to catch up."
But there were still positive results to take away, as sophomores Alena Tofte and Tony Ryerson both posted strong finishes. Tofte posted her best ever finish in a 10k free event with a 16th-place result, and Ryerson grabbed the 25th spot in the 15k free event.
The men's finish, while disappointing, was still better than any result the men's squad posted last year.
"Those were the best finishes our men have had in a number of years," City said.
Harvard now sets its sights on Sugarloaf, Maine, where it will compete in the Colby Carnival.
"It was a great way to start the season," Mitchell said. "I'm trying to keep the focus looking forward instead of being satisfied. The team is also capable of more. It was a good start, but it was just a start."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of Harvard has been enjoying a long winter break, its athletes have been hard at work for a while now.
That includes recruits, such as future Crimson basketball player Kenyatta Smith. Saturday night, the senior center from Flintridge Prep School (La Cañada Flintridge, Calif.) guided his Rebels to a 57-49 victory at the school’s rival, the Polytechnic School, in Prep’s biggest contest of the year thus far.
The 6’8”, 260-lb. Smith had a big game, tallying 14 points, 18 rebounds, and six blocks. Though, in certain areas, the 13th best senior center in the country (according to Scout.com) left some to be desired, he had a solid game overall.
On the defensive end of things, Smith shined. Shutting down most of the Panthers offense inside, the Harvard recruit singlehandedly forced Poly to take a lot of difficult shots, helping to account for the home team’s 29.2 field-goal percentage in the first half. And when the Panthers did get near the basket, Smith often swatted the shots away.
The big man also had a huge game on the boards, consistently out-jumping and out-reaching his opponents. In the process, he helped stifle many of the home team’s second chances.
Smith did struggle a bit offensively, however. Even though he tallied 14 points, he missed a number of shots he should have made, including a missed dunk early on when he got stuffed by the rim. At times, he had trouble with his touch around the basket, and his free throw form was off.
Overall, Smith’s physicality and size proved too much for the Polytechnic School. How these attributes translate next year, when he will face bigger and stronger opponents, is, of course, the big question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It does not take many guesses to figure out what the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team resolved to accomplish in the new year: capturing an Ivy League title that remained elusive last season.
The Crimson surged toward that goal with its first victory of 2011, decisively topping rival Brown, 198-97, last Friday in Seekonk, Mass. This victory marked the fourth consecutive win for Harvard against an Ivy League opponent this season.
“[J-term] is our biggest opportunity to have no stress from schoolwork and to completely focus on training,” freshman Jenna Gregoire said. “We came back early and put in a lot of work. Now we’re ready to be back in racing mode.”
J-term’s combination of work and play—the Crimson packed its bags for sunny St. Croix earlier this month—seemed to resonate with the team. Senior Kate Mills led the way at the year’s first meet, posting top finishes in both the 400 individual medley at 4:20.96 and the 100 fly at 56.13 seconds. Sophomore Laura Evans followed suit with two event wins of her own, dominating the 100 breaststroke and 100 freestyle with times of 1:07.04 and 52.43, respectively. The quartet of juniors Meghan Leddy and Alicia Lightbourne, sophomore Kelly Robinson, and Gregoire contributed to Harvard’s point total, recording a first place time of 3:55.32 in the 400-yard medley relay.
The Crimson’s freshmen swimmers witnessed further success: Sara Li won the 200 freestyle in 1:52.39, Danielle Schulkin registered the best time in the 200 butterfly in 2:02.21, and Paige Newell responded with a victory in the 200 backstroke, touching in at 2:03.91.
“We had some very strong performances from our freshmen, and it’s always exciting to see the underclassmen step up in that way,” co-captain Christine Kaufmann said.
But the Bears didn’t surrender the meet without a fight. Brown freshman Briana Borgolini claimed victory in the 200-yard breaststroke at 2:22.25 as part of the Bear trio—including fellow freshman Ellen Downing and senior Sage Erskine—that finished one-two-three in that event. Brown’s 200-free relay team of sophomore Kristin Jackson and freshmen Megan Nolet, Emma Lamothe, and Ellen Sellinger also managed to keep Harvard at bay, coming in first at the 1:38.07 mark.
In the end, the Crimson’s lead proved too substantial to overcome for Brown. Harvard’s diving squad cemented the overall team effort, with freshman Schuyler Moore clinching the one-meter event and junior Leslie Rea earning the win in the three-meter dive.
“A lot of us were tired because we were just coming off the peak [of training], but the [Brown meet] was our chance to do all the small things right, work on our strategy, and get ready for the bigger meets,” Gregoire said.
This coming weekend, the Crimson faces competition first at the World College Conference Carnival this Friday and then against Penn on Sunday.
“I think any time we have an opportunity to race in the league, we get to discover new strategies and new ways to fine tune our skills,” Kaufmann said.
But Harvard ultimately has its gaze fixed on the culminating meets of the season.
“[In February] half of our team goes to Ivies, and the other half goes to ECACs,” Gregoire said. “Our goal is to win both of those championships. We’ve been saying that since August.”
