After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patrick D. Hanan, a well-known sinologist and a former director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, died on April 26. He was 87.
As the Victor S. Thomas Professor of Chinese Literature Emeritus, Hanan specialized in Chinese literature in the late-Qing dynasty period.
Hanan grew up on a farm in New Zealand and studied Chinese at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies. He taught at Stanford University before joining the Harvard faculty in 1963.
During the following 14 years, Hanan served as chair of the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations and as the fifth director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute.
The current director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Elizabeth J. Perry, remembered him as a leader “with a rare combination of wisdom and grace.”
“Under his directorship, the Institute developed new partnerships with Chinese universities, established a new Visiting Fellows program, and launched a very successful book series with Sanlian Press in Beijing to encourage high quality scholarship in humanities and social sciences,” Perry wrote in an email.
Scholars in the field described him as a trailblazer in the study of late imperial Chinese vernacular narrative fiction.
“In China, this field had not received much attention until the introduction of his scholarship,” said Duan Huaiqing, a visiting scholar from Fudan University.
“His scholarship was extraordinary in its breadth, its focus, and its attention to the details of a culture very different from his own,” Hanan’s son, Rupert “Guy” Hanan, wrote in an obituary.
In 2005, Hanan was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in his native New Zealand for his services to higher education.
A former student of Hanan, Ellen B. Widmer described him as “very personable, very caring, and yet very formal.”
“I was the only student in his class on the fiction of the Ming and Qing dynasties. He would walk in and read a lecture from a notebook, but he always kept an eye on what I was writing down.... Such was his seriousness about elevating his students to full professional competence in the field,” said Widmer, who is now a Chinese Studies professor at Wellesley College.
David Der-wei Wang, a former colleague of Hanan, described him as “a very erudite gentleman who never showed off his knowledge.”
“As a scholar, he will be remembered for decades, even centuries, to come,” said Wang, who is a professor of Chinese literature.
Hanan’s works include “The Chinese Short Story,” “The Chinese Vernacular Story,” “Essays on Chinese Fiction of the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries,” and “The Invention of Li Yu.” He also translated many works of Chinese traditional fiction.
Hanan is survived by his wife, daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren. His son, Rupert “Guy” Hanan, died in July 2014.
A memorial ceremony will take place on Sept. 12 at 2:30 p.m. in the Belfer Case Study Room in CGIS South.

The Law School’s chief financial officer, Geoffrey S. Swift, has been named vice president for finance and administration and treasurer of Bates College, the school announced.
Swift will take office at Bates on Nov. 1. In his new position, he will work closely with A. Clayton Spencer, who served as the vice president for policy at Harvard and was noted as the right-hand woman for four consecutive University presidents. Spencer left Harvard in 2012 to take over as president of Bates.
“We are very fortunate that Geoff will be joining Bates in this key position,” Spencer said in the school’s press release. “He comes with a reputation as a creative financial strategist who is also highly effective as a day-to-day manager.”
As CFO since 2009, Swift began overseeing the Law School’s $200 million operating budget shortly after the 2008 financial crisis forced the University to cut funds across campus.
A graduate of Amherst College, Swift earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 2002. While a student at the Business School, where he later worked, Swift served as a resident business tutor at Adams House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part V of a five-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018, based on data collected by The Crimson in an email survey conducted in the month of August and data collected and shared by the Yale Daily News on the Yale freshman class.
A year after the College saw a surge in male applicants interested in studying engineering, men are overrepresented in Harvard’s freshman class. Fifty-three percent of freshmen polled in The Crimson’s survey of the College Class of 2018 identified as male, with the remaining 46.5 percent identifying as female and 0.5 percent as other.
At Yale, however, the gender imbalance is flipped, according to results of a similar survey of Yale’s freshman class conducted by the Yale Daily News. In contrast to their peers at Harvard, 55 percent of the YDN’s respondents identified as female, while 45 percent identified as male. None identified as other.
Throughout the month of August, both The Crimson and the YDN, the daily student newspaper at Yale, surveyed incoming students about their backgrounds, interests, and future plans. The results, which the two newspapers shared with each other, suggest that surveyed freshmen from both campuses hail, on the whole, from similar backgrounds—socioeconomically and geographically—but differ somewhat in what they expect to do in college.
The Crimson emailed its annual survey, which was open from Aug. 6-28, to all incoming freshmen. Of 1,667 students in the Class of 2018, 1,172 responded to the survey, representing around 70 percent of the class. The Crimson did not adjust the results for any possible selection bias.
The YDN emailed its survey to incoming Yale freshmen on Aug. 15 and closed it on Aug. 28. Of 1,364 incoming Yale freshmen, 623, or roughly 46 percent, responded. The YDN, similarly, did not adjust for any possible selection bias.
BEFORE ADMISSION
A greater proportion of Harvard respondents self-identified as legacies than their Yale counterparts. Sixteen percent of Harvard respondents have one or more parents who attended the College, indicating legacy status. In contrast, just 11 percent of surveyed Yale freshmen reported having one or more parents who graduated from Yale.
And while 73 percent of surveyed Harvard freshmen said they have no relatives who attended the College, a larger percentage of Yale respondents—78 percent—reported no family connection to the school.
Both schools offer early admissions programs ,but while just under half of surveyed Yale freshmen—48 percent—said they were admitted through early action, 56 percent of surveyed Harvard freshmen reported acceptance through the College’s early round.
Still, the two freshman classes are similar in many ways. Yale has been called the “Gay Ivy,” but a roughly comparable proportion of Yale and Harvard respondents identified as gay, bisexual, questioning, or other in the two surveys—10 percent of the Harvard freshmen polled and 13 percent at Yale.
The peers of Harvard’s Class of 2018 also reported similarities in socioeconomic background. Fifteen percent of surveyed Yale freshmen reported household incomes of more than $500,000, close to the 14 percent of Harvard respondents who said the same. A plurality of both groups reported household incomes between $125,000 and $250,000.
The survey data also indicates that politically, both classes lean left. Sixty-two percent of Yale respondents characterized their political leanings as very or somewhat liberal; 61 percent of surveyed Harvard freshmen said the same.
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, SIMILAR ORIGINS
It takes a few hours to drive to New Haven from Cambridge, but both schools are Northeast campuses. The reported geographical origins of respondents, similar in both surveys, reflect that fact.
Forty-three percent of surveyed Harvard freshmen hail from the Northeast, compared with 41 percent of their Yale counterparts; 17 percent of surveyed freshmen came to New Haven from the Tri-state area specifically. Twelve percent of both groups reported coming to college from abroad.
A majority of respondents from both schools said they came from suburban hometowns—64 percent of Harvard respondents and 63 percent from Yale. Similarly, a comparable proportion of Harvard and Yale respondents reported coming from urban areas, at 28 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Eight percent of surveyed freshmen from both schools reported living in rural communities.
Fifty-five percent of Yale respondents attended public high school, compared with 60 percent at Harvard. Thirty-one percent of surveyed Yale freshmen came to college from a private non-denominational high school, while 29 percent of Harvard respondents did.
IN COLLEGE, DIFFERENT GOALS
Yale respondents differed somewhat from their Harvard peers in how they plan to spend their time in and out of the classroom.
A plurality of surveyed Yale freshmen favored studies in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—with 39 percent reporting that their intended major falls within those fields, a smaller proportion than Harvard respondents. Fifteen percent of surveyed Yale freshmen said they intend to study the humanities, compared to 9 percent of their Harvard counterparts.
Surveyed Yale freshmen indicated relatively lesser interest in Greek life, with just 18 percent reporting plans to participate. Interest in single-sex social organizations was greater among Harvard respondents, 45 percent of whom said they were very or somewhat interested in joining a fraternity, sorority, or final club.
Fourteen percent of surveyed Yale freshmen intend to play a varsity sport at Yale, and 10 percent said they were unsure. Meanwhile, 11 percent of Harvard respondents identified as recruited athletes, and of the students who did not identify as recruited athletes, 9 percent said they intend to walk on to a varsity team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 5, 2014, at 1:44 p.m.
Part IV of a five-part series on Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018, based on data collected by The Crimson in an email survey conducted in the month of August. The complete series can be found here.
Thirty-eight percent of incoming members of the Class of 2018 surveyed by The Harvard Crimson last month reported having had sex before arriving on campus, a slight increase from last year’s class.
But analysis of the survey shows that final club and greek life hopefuls were more than twice as likely to have done the deed than those uninterested in those groups and athletes were significantly more likely than non-athletes to have lost their virginity.
Sexual habits and opinions were among a range of topics explored in The Crimson’s email survey of the incoming freshman class. The survey, conducted by The Harvard Crimson, was emailed to all incoming freshman on Aug. 6 and closed on Aug. 28. Of the 1667 students in the incoming freshman class, 1,172 responded to the survey, representing around 70 percent of the class. The survey was not adjusted for selection bias.
Exploring political opinions, drug and alcohol habits, sexual activity, and the role of technology, this installment of a five-part series on the survey’s results looks at how the newest members of the Harvard community live and view their lives away from the classroom.
TO THE LEFT
When it comes to political beliefs, Harvard’s incoming Class of 2018 appears to be decidedly liberal. A plurality of respondents identified themselves as ‘somewhat liberal,’ whereas only a combined 15 percent of respondents identified as somewhat or very conservative.
On specific political issues, a majority respondents also showed more liberal beliefs, with 58 percent of respondents favorably rating President Barack Obama, 83 percent favorably rating same-sex marriage, and 54 percent favorably rating a national minimum wage of $10.10.
Respondents appeared to be less sure about marijuana legalization, which was rated favorably by 50 percent of surveyed freshmen, and the Affordable Care Act, which was rated favorably by 48 percent.
When asked about their views on same-sex marriage, 83 percent of respondents said they have favorable views while another 9 percent said they had no opinion on the issue.
Men and women seem to have slightly different views, as male respondents were more likely than females to identify as conservative, and women on average reported have a higher opinion of President Obama than males. Only 11 percent of female respondents identified as somewhat or very conservative.
Though only 6 percent of freshmen identified as “very religious,” religious background correlates with political beliefs for the surveyed members of the Class of 2018.
Eighteen percent of respondents identified as Protestant, 19 percent as Catholic, 10 percent as Jewish, 3 percent are Muslim, and just percent 1.6 percen6 and 2.4 percent as Buddhist and Hindu, respectively. About 35 percent said they are either Atheist or Agnostic, while 10 percent choose the “other” category.
Though most demographic and religious groups exhibited strong support for President Obama, his signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, fared less well with certain groups. Thirty-six percent of Catholic respondents gave Obamacare favorable ratings, the lowest of any group. Among income groups, the highest levels of support for the healthcare legislation was concentrated in the middle income brackets.
Muslims, on average, were the least favorable toward same-sex marriage, with just 44 percent of respondents favorably rating it.
When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, Jews were on average much more supportive of legalizing the drug, and rural students were on average more supportive than their urban peers.
THE DRUG CULTURE, OR LACK THEREOF
While half of surveyed freshmen are in favor of legalizing marijuana, most do not use the substance.
Twenty-five percent of respondents reported that they had used marijuana, but only about 3 percent said they ingested the substance once a week or more. Overall, the higher a respondent's reported combined family income, the the more likely they were to have used marijuana. Less than one percent of respondents reported having tried cocaine or LSD.
Overall, respondents proved to be fairly abstinent when it came to participating in drug use, with an overwhelming majority of surveyed freshmen reporting to have never tried any drug harder than marijuana, and even more, 87 percent, saying they have not smoked tobacco.
Though respondents may cringe at the thought of lighting up a Marlboro Red, they appear to have fewer reservations about alcohol. Two-thirds of respondents have already had a first drink, with 39 percent of surveyed freshmen reporting that they have had a drink at least between once a month and once a semester.
Those who identified as white were most likely to have had a drink, with 70 percent reporting doing so. Students of Indian descent were the least likely to have reported having a drink, with less than half doing so.
Denomination aside, those who described themselves as “very religious” were the least likely to report having had a drink. Those who report being somewhat or very conservative are more likely to report having had a drink than their liberal counterparts.
Still, no matter how much they are drinking, this year’s respondents are probably not purchasing the alcohol themselves, as only 11 percent reported having a fake ID.
BETWEEN THE SHEETS
Though close to 60 percent respondents reported being virgins, men were more likely than women to have had sex. According to survey results, high family income and attending private school correlated strongly with increased sexual activity. Around 60 percent of varsity athletes report having had sex, compared to just 39 percent of non-athletes.
When it comes to religious groups, Jews reported being the most sexually active, followed by atheists and agnostics.
Respondents who indicated that they were “very interested” in joining a final club or greek organization were more than twice as likely to report having had sex than respondents who said they were “not at all interested” in punching or pledging.
The most common time to lose virginity among respondents was in either 11th or 12th grade.
International students reported having had more sexual partners than their American peers, with 66 percent of non-virgin international respondents claiming multiple partners. Rural respondents also had more sexual partners than city kids, with 63 percent of rural non-virgins claiming multiple partners compared to 46 percent for urban dwellers. Students who identified as homosexual on average reported having more sexual partners than heterosexul respondents.
APPLE NATION
If the Harvard freshman class were judged on its diversity solely by what type of computer its students own, it would not be very diverse. According to the survey, 71 percent of respondents own a Mac and 73 percent carry an iPhone in their pocket. The vast majority are also plugged into Facebook, with only 2 percent of surveyed freshmen abstaining from the social-media site. A slim majority also participates in Twitter, with 52 percent of the class having an account.
When broken down a bit further, though, the apparent homogeneity is less consistent. While 77 percent of white respondents reported owning a Mac, only 58 percent of black respondents did. Income differences also revealed a disparity within the majorities—over 91 percent of the highest family income bracket reported owning a Mac, while only 57 percent of the lowest income group reported ownership.
The most common reported estimation of time spent on Facebook was “between 16 and 30 minutes.” Still, most respondents reported spending far more time studying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after finishing undefeated in Ivy League play for the first time since 1999, the Harvard women’s soccer team is ready to continue its success in 2014.
The Crimson knows from experience that may be easier said than done. In the past six years, Harvard has won the Ivy League Championship every other year, capturing the title in 2009, 2011, and 2013. The team hopes to change this pattern in 2014.
“Coming off an Ivy Championship, we can’t get complacent,” co-captain Marie Margolius said.  “We can’t be on too much of a high because that doesn’t put us in a good position for this year.”
With seven seniors and all but two starters returning, Harvard will have a wealth of leadership and experience on the field this fall as it looks to stay atop the Ancient Eight.
Despite losing first team All-Ivy defender, Peyton Johnson, the Crimson returns six other 2013 All-Ivy selections. Sophomore forward Midge Purce, who garnered both Ivy League Rookie and Player of the Year accolades last season, will again lead Harvard’s attack. Purce returns to the lineup joined by junior midfielder Haley Washburn, senior defender Erika Garcia, senior goalie Cheta Emba, senior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, and Margolius.
In addition to the strong core of seasoned players, the team welcomes six freshmen. Both captains expressed excitement about the incoming freshmen and the contributions they have already made both on and off the field.
“The freshmen have already had an impact,” Casscells-Mamby said. “They each bring something individually that’s very different, but it’s all very important for our team dynamic.”
Head coach Ray Leone, who has led Harvard to four Ivy League Championships during his seven-year tenure, knows from experience that talent is not enough. He has emphasized both mental and physical preparation in the weeks leading up to this season.
“[Leone]’s been working really hard with us on just staying focused on the current moment,” co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby said. “Whether it’s a practice or a game, we try to stay focused and energetic.”
For his returning players, Leone’s emphasis on the importance of focusing on the immediate future is nothing new. But this season, he has pushed physical fitness in a way he has never before.
“We hope to be the fittest team in the Ivy League,” said Casscells-Hamby. “We don’t want anyone to outwork us.”
Leone and his squad hope that this preparation will pay off, especially in the team’s opening nonconference slate. Last season, the Crimson struggled out of the gate with three consecutive losses for the first time since 1996.
“Each one of those losses taught us something,” Margolius said. “And we really, truly believed in ourselves. We believed in what we could do as a team. That was never in question.”
The team’s confidence and optimism paid off in 2013. Harvard turned it around after an 0-3-1 start, going undefeated in its next 14 games to set the longest winning streak in team history. On that stretch, the Crimson outscored its opponents, 36-9.
Harvard intends to build off that momentum in its 2014 campaign, which opens this weekend with a pair of nonconference games. The Crimson will face San Francisco at home on Friday, and then travel to take on Providence on Sunday.
After this weekend, Harvard will play five more non-conference games before opening Ivy League play against Penn, the second-place finisher in the Ancient Eight last season.
As the Crimson gets set to defend its title, the team intends to take the same approach that it did last season.
“We take each game in stride,” Margolius said. “The highs are never too high and the lows are never too low… that’s something we live by.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You have never seen senior Zach Hodges quite like this, you might have thought if you went to Harvard football practice this week.
Maybe you have seen Hodges line up many times, hands on the turf like an elite sprinter, ready to attack his prey with unmatched ferocity.
Even when he is not in the game, you notice him, always dancing, all arms and exuberance. You can’t miss him: No. 99 in the fluorescent cap, armbands, and socks.
But at a practice this week, you could. You could have gone down to Harvard Stadium and watched a two-hour practice while hardly catching a glimpse of the man they call “Sack Hodges.”
If you did that, you probably left confused as to why Hodges is considered one of the country’s top NFL prospects. You probably asked yourself why Hodges was so different. You had never seen him like that.
Let me explain.
Maybe you missed him because he is playing a different position. Straying from his spot on the right tackle’s shoulder, Hodges is practicing standing up as a hybrid lineman/linebacker this year.
It is not often that a reigning Ivy League Player of the Year changes positions, but Harvard coach Tim Murphy said Hodges’ new role better exploits his versatility.
“He’s a guy you will see in a lot of different places,” Murphy said. “He can drop [back in coverage], he can rush, [and] he can play inside as a linebacker.”
The move will help Hodges’ NFL chances, as he projects as an outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme at the next level. Murphy said that if an NFL scout asked a year ago about Hodges’ ability to seamlessly transition to that position in the pros, Murphy’s response would have been “it is hard to picture.”
Now though, Murphy added, “there is no question.”
Hodges has already been named to the watch list for the 2014 Butkus Award, given to the country’s top linebacker. He is the only FCS player to make the list.
Dane Brugler, an NFL Draft analyst for CBSsports.com recently labeled Hodges a “potential top-100 prospect” in the 2015 draft. The site lists him as the nation’s No. 2 senior linebacker, behind only Clemson’s Vic Beasley. Hodges is projected as a second or third-round pick on the site.
“To be honest with you, I’ve been sort of amazed by his instant ability as a linebacker,” Murphy said. “He’s probably even more of a natural when he’s in a two-point stance at the second level [compared to playing defensive end].”
All that hype probably made you look particularly hard for Hodges during practice.
But once you found him, you probably lost sight of him again. Hodges lingered at the back of the line during drills and often eased up when he was in. Eventually, you probably realized why.
During an 11-on-11 drill, Hodges slowly drifted from standing opposite a slot receiver towards his traditional home along the line of scrimmage before the snap of the ball. You could briefly see the kinetic energy welling up in his shuffling legs, the kind that shows up before Hodges does something only Hodges does.
But then you heard, and you were made aware.
“Easy Zach,” a coach yelled out just before the ball was snapped. “Easy. Easy.”
The coach also saw and knew, so he stopped Hodges unlike you had seen Hodges stopped before.
Practice like you play, football coaches tell most players. But Hodges is not most players.
“He doesn’t always really bring it because, put quite simply, we tell him against some guys you just can’t do that,” Murphy said. “They are either going to get hurt or they are going to get so embarrassed that we limit his reps.”
The restraints help Hodges too. After he dealt with a strained groin last year, the coaching staff is making sure his intensity does not lead to another injury before the season starts.
Hodges ended up having to leave practice early, but you might not have noticed. The real Zach Hodges was never there to begin with.
The drab white tape he wore was evidence of that. He will save the real stuff for game day.
Practice makes perfect, they say. But if you already can play like Hodges, maybe it is better not to risk it.
Don’t believe that?
Well, you will see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference a year makes.
After winning just five of its 34 games from 2011-2012, the Harvard men’s soccer team came into last season with little to no expectations. Now, one year later, after posting its best season in years, the Crimson enters the 2014 campaign as a frontrunner to win the Ivy League.
Finishing 5-2-0 in conference play last season, Harvard cemented its position as an Ancient Eight contender. And this weekend, the team will have a chance to prove that it can contend against the nation’s best.
The Crimson will open the season on the road Friday against No. 9 Georgetown (0-0-2). The Hoyas, who finished last season with a 14-5-2 record, are tabbed to finish first in the Big East and get back to the NCAA Tournament for the third year in a row. Nonetheless, Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer says his side is ready for the challenge that lies ahead.
“We feel we can compete with anyone nationally,” Lehrer said. “We have to be wise about how we play top teams…but we can win parts of the game that other teams aren’t committed to winning. As we win those, our odds of winning the game continually increases.”
The Crimson will take the field for the first time Friday under the leadership of Lehrer’s new co-captains, junior defender Mark Ashby and senior midfielder Kyle Henderson. The duo will have large shoes to fill, as former captains Ross Friedman and Kevin Harrington combined to record 20 points (4 goals and 12 assists) last season.
“Ross and Kevin were huge voices and leaders on the team, but we consider the team a team of leaders,” Ashby said. “We look at the entire group as being able to step up and lead in different scenarios. Regardless of a freshman or a senior, we consider everyone to have an equal role.”
Having played both Princeton and Penn each of the last four years, Georgetown has grown accustomed to competing against Ivy League teams. And thanks to a California connection, the Hoyas will certainly have some familiarity with the Harvard side.
While working as an assistant at Stanford from 1999-2001, Lehrer worked alongside Georgetown coach Brian Wiese, a former goalkeeper for Dartmouth.
“[Wiese] is a very good defensive coach,” Lehrer said. “He is methodical and that gives us a challenge because we know that we are facing a team that will be extremely well-prepared. It will be two well-prepared teams battling.”
After Friday’s contest, the Crimson will head down the street to take on George Washington (1-0-1) on Sunday. The Colonials are coming off a disappointing 2013 campaign, which saw them go 5-10-2.
One player who will be looking to have an immediate impact for the Crimson this weekend is junior defender Philip Fleischman. The junior was the only member of the Harvard backline to record multiple goals last season, and he’ll be eyeing a few more this year.
“We’ve been working hard out there just trying to take the team forward every day,” Fleischman said. “So it’s exciting that the season is finally approaching. We’ve been working towards this for a while.”
Junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez will likely get the start in net for both contests, following the departure of senior net-minder Brett Conrad. Mendez began last season as the backup but seized the starting job in October, posting a 6-1-1 record and allowing just 0.85 goals per game.
Despite winning six of its last eight games to close the 2013 season, the Crimson opened last year 1-6-2, so the squad will be aiming to set the tone much earlier this time around, beginning with Georgetown.
“We kind of look at each season as its own separate campaign,” Fleischman said. “The second the season ended last year, we just started focusing on this season. And we’ve been focusing on Georgetown since the end of last fall.”

Happy Friday! So here we are, already at the end of shopping week. Whether you shopped three classes every hour or three classes all week, we’re sure you're ready for a long and relaxing weekend. We are, at least. It’s moderately terrifying how much relief we feel for the weekend when school hasn’t even started yet, but we’ve convinced ourselves it’s just because we’re still on summer mode. That’s legit, right? Either way, we're not ready to transition back. Can we have another set of Opening Days?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Tomorrow’s high is a steamy 90 degrees, complete with 51% humidity. It’ll be sunny all day, and there’s no chance of rain. Why are we dreading all four of those things? We’ll miss this weather at some point, right? Right?!

2) Can You Guess Which of these Harvard Course Titles are Real? Always a valid question, especially when you hear what the kids sitting behind you on the shuttle is shopping.
IN THE NEWS
1) Compost Program Rolls Out for Freshman Dorms: Several offices across the College have collaborated to roll out a comprehensive residential composting program in all 17 freshman dormitories. Green ’17, a group of students from the Class of 2017 focused on sustainability issues on campus spearheaded the composting initiative after running a pilot program in which they personally transported compost from Mower and Greenough Halls to dining halls three times a week.
2) Dunster Residents Return After Toilet Overflow Forces Them to Relocate: Six students will be returning to their rooms in Dunster’s swing housing on Prescott Street Thursday after large amounts of toilet water spilled out onto their bathroom floor just four days earlier, forcing them to relocate to other Harvard housing.
EVENTS: WEEKEND EDITION
There are a number of cool things going on this weekend. Start it off right by getting all pre-professional at the OCS On Campus Interview program fair from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Gutman Conference Center and the Sheraton Commander. Bring your resume and wear your tie and/or pearls, you’re going to want to dress to impress.
If you’re not really ready for the job market yet, stick to campus-centric things by stopping by the Activities Fair from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the SOCH and the Quad Lawn. Representatives from over 400 student organizations will be on hand to chat, chill, and force you to sign up for their mailing list. Dinner from restaurants around Boston will also be served.
Once you’ve done enough networking to last you until Freshman Parent’s Weekend, get your freak on at one of the three college-wide dance parties this weekend: Rush Hour IV, sponsored by BMF, AAA, AAB, BSA, and CSA, takes place in Northwest Labs from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Friday night. Hotspot, hosted by QSA, GLOW, and the Trans Task Force, is in the SOCH from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday. Last but not least, Latin Fire, sponsored by Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, Concilio Latino, and the Latino Men's Collective takes places from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. in Lowell dining hall Saturday night.
If you’re not feeling Rush Hour, you can head to Lowell Lecture Hall tonight from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. to check out Harvard Underground, performances from Harvard’s hip hop scene.
You can also visit the Mac Quad for free macarons and a movie screening of “Coco Before Chanel”, starting at 8 p.m. tonight.

College students can barely take care of themselves, much less their pets. This hasn’t stopped a few brave souls though—read their horror stories, their delights, and that one time they brought their mouse to Lowell Lecture Hall in a Starbucks cup. Enjoy the third part in this miniseries here!:
PAPER THE HAMSTER
Flyby: How did you name your pet?Pet owner: When we got Paper we were looking at all the hamsters and I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve never seen such a white hamster!’ So then my friend asked ‘What are you gonna name her? You have to name her based on how white she is like, like Snowball or Paper or something.’ And Paper was so stupid that it stuck.
Flyby: Is it hard keeping your pet a secret?Pet owner: Um, no, my proctor actually knows. He walked in once and said, ‘Is that one of those hamster cages where there’s not actually a hamster and it just makes you feel like you’re more at home?’ And my roommate said, ‘Yeah..um...uh no, I think there’s no animal in there.’ And then [Paper] just comes out of her wheel and starts running, and my roommate tripped up on himself and said, ‘Oh wait, I guess there actually is. I don’t take care of it that much, so I don’t really know!’ And my proctor was like, ‘That’s fine. I’m not Yard Ops so I don’t care.’
LADDY THE LEOPARD GECKO
Flyby: When did you first get your pet?Pet owner: I got Laddy in January 2010. About four and a half years ago. One of my friends from school back home had a lot of pets and he took in the gecko, but then realized it was one too many. He asked if anyone wanted it and I had been looking for a lizard or gecko, so I said ‘Yeah, sure!’ It was a very easy decision.
Flyby: How easy is it raising a pet? How do you find time to take care of it?Pet owner: They’re very low maintenance. It’s just a matter of going on the T and going to a pet store every week or two to get crickets, which is kind of a pain in the ass because there’s no where to get crickets around here. It’s an hour out of the way. That’s the main thing. Also just cleaning out the cage and kind of getting him out and letting him crawl around me every once in a while. But, you know, it’s nothing terribly difficult at all.
Flyby: Is it hard keeping your pet a secret?Pet owner: Not really. It’s in a cage and if anybody thought about it, they might ask why I have a red light in my room. Even though it’s pretty blatantly obvious I have a red light, no one questions it. When I’m gone or if there are room inspections I always worry about it, but nothing has come of it.
