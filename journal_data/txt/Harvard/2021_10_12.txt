After a year of isolation, BTS and Coldplay’s collaborative single “My Universe” comes as an unabashed anthem to bringing worlds together — a sonic wave for all to catch of genuine personal connection. The song’s unique impact lies in the context of its creation. BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondan), the world-renowned boy band described by many as South Korea’s national pride, and British pop rock icons Coldplay have each dedicated their careers to providing deep engagement and comfort for their fans, including throughout quarantine. This honest commitment transforms the song from a feel-good hit into a personal gift, a passion project, and an anthem for change.
“You are my universe” is a bold declaration with which to begin a song. Indeed, the song’s scale is delightfully over-the-top, especially when combined with a symphony of pumping synths, a commanding bass line, and eight of pop’s most soulful male voices all individually featured. Much like a declaration of love, something that big can seem overwhelming unless the person saying it has a truly honest connection to the recipient. BTS and Coldplay, as the declarers, provide the song with that magic touch.
Part of the reason why this works is the recording’s sense of fun. A playful air laces the combination of each group’s unique styles, as they create something new in both of their ballparks. BTS’s lyrical contributions are poignant and reflective, harkening back to the more fan-oriented and experimental selections of their Korean-language discography. The members perform their parts with an individual tenderness, as if each were a sweet solo in an ensemble. Their intimacy is stitched together and amplified by Chris Martin’s typical presence in the chorus, charismatic and brimming with triumph.
But one thing ties the two disparate groups together: a deep desire — indeed, a promise — for live performance to return. On this convergence, the composition reveals the influence of both groups’ stage traditions: EDM-style breaks for BTS’s famous dance routines, and long, drawn-out vocal refrains for Coldplay’s movement across the stage. The effect is one of hearing a live performance — of being in the room where BTS and Coldplay shout, sing, and move their way into a song together. Woven into the rhythm and lyrics is a vow that we will be together again, and that promise is enough to make a listener want to break out into dance.
It’s no coincidence that the groups share this mission, and the collaboration didn’t come out of the blue — it’s the latest culmination of a long trend of mutual admiration between them. Not only had the group reached out to Chris Martin early in the pandemic posing the idea to work on a track, but during BTS’s MTV Unplugged Performance Series this past February, they also paid homage to Coldplay by covering their classic “Fix You,” much to the delight of the original performers. The cover was subtle compared to their dazzling choreographed shows — just the seven members sitting on a row of stools, backlit by a row of rising white lights. But BTS managed to crystallize the song’s timeless mantra of healing into something completely their own: a gentle reassurance uniquely fitted to a time of chaos, offered towards an audience of those feeling the emotional and psychological impact of such chaos the hardest.
Thus, the meshing of each group’s elements in this song has meaning beyond the mere fun of collaboration. It represents a union between two groups that bridge divides, creating cross-cultural art in a time when it is most necessary. The process of writing and recording the song was a matter of translation: of bringing two icons from two realms of music together on a common mission, without value judgment or inhibitions, and beyond challenges.
This points to the role that both groups have taken on throughout their careers, especially over the course of the past year. BTS has prided itself on being a group focused on social impact and emotional well-being, and were even appointed by the president of South Korea as United Nations Presidential Special Envoys for Future Generations and Culture. They have consistently created music, multimedia entertainment, and public addresses that have brought joy to a public confined at home. Meanwhile, Martin played sets of his classics on Instagram Live for fans on the WHO’s Together, At Home: WHO-Global Citizen Solidarity Sessions. Both acts have provided comfort for fans in a time of uncertainty, reassuring them that even when obscured by darkness, the music will be there to hold your hand. This context makes BTS rapper Suga’s lines resonate with special truth: “Because you are my stars and my universe / These hardships are just temporary / Just shine as bright as you shine now / We will follow you to adorn this long night.”
“My Universe” grants listeners permission to be over-the-top after such a long time being subdued. If pop music has an essential purpose at its core, these two groups from two different sides of the world have tapped it; and, performing the more rare and precious task, they have made us believe it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 30, Harvard’s graduate student union created the sketch for a new picket line to be drawn through Harvard’s campus, announcing that its members overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike. This strike authorization, which comes not two years after the union’s consequential late-2019 strike, was preceded by nearly six months of negotiation with the University over a second contract.
Should Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers choose to strike, we will support them, as we have already promised. However, we hope that the situation does not come to that.
A strike would be extremely disruptive to College students’ education, and to the operations of the University as a whole. Some of us remember having limited opportunities for office hours and receiving delayed grades during the 2019 strike, which kindly hadn’t even started until classes were already over. At the time, even mail delivery to the University was disrupted. These inconveniences caused by a strike are a testament to the centrality of graduate students to a functioning university. Harvard should take this strike authorization as a serious warning sign, and work quickly towards achieving a contract.
In working towards a strong solution, there are still considerable disagreements that need to be resolved. For instance, the University has not yet conceded to HGSU-UAW’s call to allow third-party arbitration of discrimination and sexual harassment complaints. This refusal becomes part of a worrying trend when we consider how other unions on campus, such as the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, have allegedly had trouble getting the University to honor prior agreements about third-party mediation.
HGSU-UAW is also asking for further increases in compensation and benefits. This call for higher wages emerges as particularly important during a time in which the cost of living in Cambridge continues to surge. It is necessary that graduate students’ pay reflects these increases.
We must remember that teachers’ working conditions — or in this case, teaching fellows’ working conditions — are students’ learning conditions. How we treat our graduate student workers will be reflected in how they can approach their research and classroom responsibilities: We must be generous.
Despite the points of disagreement, there is reason to be hopeful: For the next few weeks, HGSU-UAW will continue to negotiate with the University through a federal mediator. This is a sign that these negotiations are being taken seriously, and perhaps, through these efforts, a contract favorable to all will be reached without necessitating a strike. After all, the introduction of such a mediator is what changed the tides two years ago.
The possibility of two strikes within two years is indicative of the national and ongoing fundamental restructuring of the relationship between graduate students and their universities. We must situate the developments here amidst a broader movement towards recognizing the labor rights of graduate students across higher education. Just last month, MIT’s graduate students officially announced their unionization, joining the ranks of graduate students at other universities like New York University, Columbia University, and Brown University in their calls for basic protections like comparable healthcare benefits, fair pay, and protections from sexual harassment and discrimination.
Forging this new path has been rocky, but exciting given its prospects for the empowerment and betterment of the lives of graduate student workers. Here at home, our own graduate students are carrying the spirit of this larger movement, growing louder, bolder, and rightfully more impatient.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are finally awake, Generation Z. Whether it be microaggressions, misogyny, climate change, or capitalism, our generation has gained traction taking a stand against injustice and intolerance.
Some, however, may think that Gen Z is fostering a toxic cancel culture, perpetuating a society where those who make mistakes are immediately shunned, and cultivating an environment where your actions of the past taint your present and future. Many from my generation, however, argue that in order to have true equality, we need to take forceful action to hold each person accountable for any injustices they have committed, whether they took place 10 years or two days ago.
I, however, disagree with both of these extreme stances. Today's cancel culture often falls short of punishing individuals who commit the worst offenses whilst targeting those who deserve this punishment the least.
There are multiple case studies that explore this phenomenon. We can look at Natasha Tynes, an author who was canceled on Twitter for writing an offensive tweet about a Washington, D.C. Metro worker eating on the train, which the Metro Authority prohibits. Afterward, Tynes’s publisher canceled her upcoming book deal. She also received numerous threats and suffered a nervous breakdown that sent her to the hospital.
While I could agree that Tynes’s tweet was uncalled for and unnecessary, I could not agree that her entire life should be destroyed by it.
Furthermore, at the same time that we attempt to eradicate any up-and-coming author such as Tynes who has made rude comments, we often overlook more widespread injustices that are not only offensive to a few individuals but systematically damage communities.
One of the most significant cases of this issue is the theories surrounding Black pain. During the 19th century, physicians wrote several papers that Black people experience a lower pain tolerance than white people. These essays still influence the enormously disparate treatment of Black patients today. If we feel the need to focus on the writings of authors, this is where we should turn our attention.
I believe in holding people accountable for their actions, but I also remember the unfavorable things I have said. Moreover, I remember remaining silent in the face of harmful words that my friends and siblings may have said or words my parents and elders definitely have said. From my experiences, I’ve reached a decision; you can objectively conclude that someone has done something wrong without wanting to destroy that person’s livelihood. Cancel culture attempts to bring particular individuals to justice when what we need is equity across whole systems.
While we are able to end a common citizen’s life from a single tweet or offensive comment, those who genuinely need to be held accountable often escape their situations with little to no repercussions. We’re ridding ourselves of the Harvey Weinsteins, but what about the dozens who stood behind him? We’re locking up the Derek Chauvins, yet allowing the police strongholds that created him to stand firm. We have Western universities continuing to withhold Native American artifacts and remnants of their culture when many of these same universities and their leaders played a crucial role in destabilizing Native Americans’ livelihoods. Our own institution is expressly guilty of this act.
Cancel culture has made some progress on these issues such as sexual assault and police brutality that desperately need drastic change. Nonetheless, the perpetrators held accountable through cancellation are but a drop in the bucket when the entire system needs reformation. We can continue to move at the pace of holding individual people accountable for every wrong action they committed, rather than remaining complacent. One could argue that it’s a step in the right direction, but how long will it take to arrive at our destination? Moreover, when we finally do arrive, will the path we created behind us lead to a more sustainable future?
Removing the systems that amplify our society’s injustice is what we need to prioritize, not everyday people who make a few individuals upset on social media.
Our generation has been awakened to many more injustices than our predecessors. But we cannot fight every battle in the hopes of winning an infinite internet war. Instead, we can remain vigilant, act upon harmful systems to improve our collective well-being, and fortify the change we need for the future.

I love seeing the confusion that flashes through the eyes of a straight white man as he tries to decide what aspect of my identity to attack first. Should he go with the tried and true misogyny, or sneer at my caramel skin? Or perhaps he should settle for the low-hanging fruit and comment on my hijab.
Intersectionality, or being at the crossroads of several different social identities, sets me up to be targeted in more ways than one. But in a way, it equally impacts the posture of the victim and the perpetrator. Just as my distinct identity as a brown Muslim American woman leaves me vulnerable to several avenues of slurs, a white cisgender man’s distinction leaves him in the perfect position to pick at such opportunities with few repercussions. If even one aspect of this man’s identity was different, these encounters would go very differently.
For better or worse, I no longer feel bothered by the casual racism I encounter daily, whether that’s families choosing the stairs to avoid an elevator ride with me or classmates glancing across the room when discussing another terrorist attack in the news. I’ve grown accustomed to the slight jabs at my feminine physique or the condescending way that male employees talk to me when I need help.
These aggressions have the opposite of their intended effect; when I am judged by the outside world, I’m drawn closer to the exact groups that I am singled out for being a part of. Each patronizing compliment of my parents’ accent makes me love my Bengali language more, and each tug at my hijab makes me prouder to tie the scarf around my head.
The real burden of intersectionality, however, arises from the biases within the multiple communities we claim to be our own.
I remember when my family was preparing for our trip to Bangladesh in 2016 — my first visit back to my parents’ homeland in over a decade. I was ecstatic at the chance to travel to a country where I would be surrounded by people who looked like me. It didn’t take long for me to learn my fantasies were just that.
In an environment where I expected to be my most comfortable, I found myself feeling ogled at and ostracized. My dreams of sitting around the dinner table and gorging on the Bangladeshi food my mom cooks at home in its native setting quickly turned sour when every host offered me some pasta or fried chicken instead. We spoke the same language but mine was heavily doused in my American accent and punctuated with hesitation between sentences as I searched for the right words. My relatives did not see me as purely Bangladeshi — I was the American coming to dabble in their culture. Despite their best intentions, I felt like a misplaced puzzle piece. While I belonged to the broader picture, I’d been oriented incorrectly and jammed in, impersonating who I expected myself to be. More than anything, I felt guilty for growing up in America, where I hadn’t devoted as much time to developing my identity as a Bangladeshi because I was too caught up trying to balance my other identities as well.
I experience the same song in a different tune at home (in this case, home as in America). Many mosques across the country embody a type of segregation, whether willingly or unwillingly. In some cities, there are distinct mosques for Bangladeshi communities, Pakistani communities, Indian communities, and so on. In other cities, like my own hometown in Texas, mosque-goers will inadvertently section themselves off and only associate with their ethnic group. Our tendencies to gravitate towards our own can be comforting but also obstructive: We no longer feel connected to others who share a facet of our character. We become separate groups of brown Muslims and Arab Muslims, white Americans and Black Americans.
Even at Harvard, we are not immune from the complications of intersectionality. Like before, I feel these divides peeking through the various affinity organizations I associate with. When searching for belonging in a new environment, intersectionality can almost feel more like a hindrance than a highlight of one’s identity.
I don’t fit in perfectly with my family in Bangladesh or my mosque in Texas or even among the diverse student body at Harvard. I find often that the only place I can truly fit like a puzzle piece is when I am surrounded by individuals who share the exact same intersecting identities as me, rather than among a diverse group.
But I don’t think that should be.
There is no “perfect fit.” I don’t believe that our communities are best pre-sectioned or that we should feel like we “fit in” only when we match perfectly. Rather, everyone should feel at home among any community that they recognize as theirs.
If we wish to welcome individuals outside of our niche spheres of social categorization, we must first learn to be comfortable with our own identities, as complex as they may be. Once we can accept that diversity goes beyond a handful of shades — that part of diversity is the wide range of intersecting identities and not just stand-alone affiliations — I believe we will be able to expand our horizons and expose ourselves to incredibly unique perspectives.
We need no longer be confused when we see individuals with intersectional identities that, to our minds, don’t usually overlap. We need only to love.

The Harvard Undergraduate Council voted to establish caucuses for Afro-Latinx and Indigeneous students and to pilot a new “Dean’s Dinners” program with Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
The initiative to create the two new caucuses consists of two separate pieces of legislation, one per caucus. The caucus system aims to strengthen the UC’s connections with affinity groups on campus.
The two new caucuses will join existing Black, Latinx, Asian-American, and First-Generation Low-Income Caucuses and represent groups that have been underrepresented in society, both within and outside Harvard, according to the legislation.
Caucuses can propose legislation regarding event publicity or UC issue statements.
“As the inheritors and torchbearers of deep-rooted and vulnerable ways of life, the Afro-Latinx community possesses a compelling interest in enhanced representation,” one of the UC acts reads. Another act contains the same statement for Indigeneous students.
The legislation also states that recognizing Afro-Latinx and Indigeneous students on campus is important, as the UC aims to recognize diverse voices.
The act to establish an Afro-Latinx caucus was sponsored by Maple Yard Representative Jada Pierre ’25. The act to create an Indigeneous caucus was sponsored by Dunster House Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24, Ivy Yard Representative Sebastian Ramírez Feune ’25, and Cabot House Representative Damien Z. Chang ’24. Both were passed by unanimous consent.
The initiative to pilot a “Dean’s Dinner” program will allow a randomly selected group of undergraduates to dine at O’Dair’s house this fall.
“Bringing together a randomly selected group of undergraduates for dinner could foster unexpected, diverse conversations and friendships,” the legislation reads.
The program is inspired by Amherst College’s Pindar Field dinner series, which stimulates “academic and cultural dialogue beyond the classroom environment” by inviting students from various majors to converse and dine together.
The UC allocated $1,200 to fund the pilot series of dinners this fall. The allocation allows five groups of 12 undergraduate students to participate in the program. The program will ask students who are selected for the program to confirm their attendance at the dinner.
The first dinner is projected to occur between Oct. 18 and Oct. 29, and others are planned for later in the semester.
The legislation was sponsored by Quincy House Representative Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and was adopted by unanimous consent.
If this program proves successful, the Dean of Students Office may attempt to institutionalize the program and provide funding for it in the future, according to the UC.

A widespread security oversight left at least tens of thousands of Harvard’s administrative files — including sensitive and confidential information on University governance — available for anyone with Harvard credentials to view, edit, download, and share.
For at least the last several months, users of the search engine Bing who logged in with their Harvard-affiliated email accounts could access certain files and internal websites created or worked on by other University affiliates on the Microsoft-owned platforms OneDrive and SharePoint. Files left available included those viewed or created by mid-level employees all the way up to some associated with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and President Lawrence S. Bacow.
The documents remained available until The Crimson contacted the University about the issue last week. Over the weekend, the University disabled the ability to use Bing to search the Microsoft platforms linked to Harvard and shut down a similar internal search function within Microsoft 365 called Delve.
Harvard University Information Technology spokesperson Timothy J. Bailey wrote in an emailed statement Monday that HUIT is currently “taking appropriate steps” to identify unauthorized access to sensitive files, revert sensitive files back to private, and create guidelines to protect confidential information going forward.
“Harvard University officials are aware that some individuals within the Harvard community may have accessed files that they are not authorized to view,” he wrote. “This access and exposure is not the result of malicious activity by external actors.”
Harvard administrators rely on Microsoft 365 software to share documents internally, including files containing confidential information.
OneDrive and SharePoint offer file creators an array of privacy setting options, ranging from personal use only to a “shared with everyone” selection, which some Harvard employees selected in an apparent attempt to share documents with colleagues on their teams.
But by choosing to send files using the “shared with everyone” option, dozens of University administrators inadvertently opened the door for any Harvard affiliates to stumble upon the files.
Through its Microsoft Search in Bing functionality — which was introduced in June 2021 — the search engine indexed any files owned or worked on by University affiliates that were not placed on a private setting. A user logged into Bing with their HarvardKey could be offered these documents by the search engine simply by entering key terms or administrator, faculty, staff, or student names.
The documents left vulnerable included user passwords stored unencrypted, HUID numbers, donor names, and employee vaccination status reports. There were also memos on University finances; detailed personnel data; diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; and campus expansion plans.
A Microsoft support webpage on Microsoft Search in Bing confirmed that administrators cannot access an individual’s school search history, meaning the University would not be able to determine who may have accessed which documents. HUIT can only “see the number of searches by type (people, files, etc.) and an aggregated list of top searches,” according to the webpage.
“We’re aware of the issue and supporting our customer,” a Microsoft spokesperson wrote in an email regarding Harvard’s security oversight.
Even though the files would only appear for a Bing user logged into their Harvard credentials, the oversight could potentially expose the vulnerable information to a much broader audience, according to Kennesaw State University professor Andrew Green, who studies information security.
Green said Bing’s download and share options heighten the risk of exposure.
“Once that data is out there and can be downloaded by anybody, it can be shared with everybody,” Green said. “So when we start looking at potential scope, this is global exposure — whether or not it actually happened.”
“This information leakage is bad,” he added. “We don’t really know the potential impact yet, because we don’t know who’s gotten their hands on it.”

Approximately 25 Harvard custodians rallied in Science Center Plaza Friday, asking the University to postpone the opening of negotiations with their union — set for Wednesday — until intraunion conflicts are resolved.
The custodians alleged their union, Service Employees International Union 32BJ, is ignoring several concerns that some Bargaining Committee members are bringing forward on their behalf, particularly around the union’s health insurance plan. The rally-goers also asserted that the union is shutting out their elected Bargaining Committee from preparations for contract negotiations with Harvard.
Gerardo Zavala Alfaro, a custodian at Northwest Labs, said he felt a lack of transparency from union leadership around health care decisions.
“I am uniting with my colleagues because the health insurance that we are being offered is a scam,” he said. “There are many things it doesn’t cover, and there are a bunch of complexities in that insurance plan.”
Custodians at the rally circulated a petition demanding the union use Harvard’s contributions toward the 32BJ Health Benefits Fund for the “exclusive benefit of Harvard custodians.”
The petition alleges that Harvard workers’ health care contributions are funding union administrative expenses and the non-Harvard workers in 32BJ, which represents more than 175,000 employees primarily across the East Coast, according to the union’s website.
“We’re collecting signatures,” union shop steward Daniel C. Valderrama said. “We’re going to take some pictures that we’re gonna give to Harvard and show them that there’s an issue here and they cannot negotiate anything with the union until all members, we agree on something.”
The majority of the Bargaining Committee wanted to reopen the issue of health insurance, but multiple members were muted when they brought up an alternate health insurance proposal on an Oct. 1 Zoom call with union leadership, including the union’s attorney, Raul Garcia, and 32BJ Vice President Roxana L. Rivera, according to Valderrama, Law School custodian Henry A. Rodriguez, and Zavala Alfaro.
Rivera wrote in an emailed statement that 32BJ is “committed” to working with union members to reach “the strongest possible” contract with the University.
She added the 32BJ Health Benefits Fund covers 175,000 union members and is not subject to individual bargaining agreements.
“That said, it is one of the best insurance plans in the country, with no premiums or deductibles, including for a member’s spouse and dependents,” Rivera wrote.
Not all bargaining committee members support the push for a new health plan. Javier Rodriguez, a bargaining committee member working at the Medical School, said through a union translator that his coworkers haven’t voiced any complaints about health insurance. Helena Bandeira, a Bargaining Committee member who works at the Law School, said she also hasn’t heard complaints about health care.
But in an Oct. 1 email to Garcia, the union’s attorney, obtained by The Crimson, bargaining committee member José Rivera wrote that he was representing the “majority” of the committee in criticizing Garcia for “rude and unprofessional” conduct and dismissal of “bargaining issues that are of paramount importance to the unit members.”
“We were prepared to be strong advocates in the negotiations with Harvard University,” José Rivera wrote. “However, we were not aware that we also had to watch our backs from an official of our own union.”
In another email obtained by The Crimson, nine of the twelve bargaining committee members wrote to Harvard Director of Employee and Labor Relations Paul R. Curran on Oct. 4 asking him to postpone the first bargaining session scheduled for Oct. 13.
That same day, Garcia emailed the Bargaining Committee, writing the letter to Curran should be disregarded since it “was unauthorized by the Union.”
“Any such statement should only come from our Vice-President Roxana Rivera or me as Chief Negotiator,” Garcia wrote. “Paul Curran has confirmed this afternoon that Harvard University will begin negotiations with the Union on October 13.”
Two days later, on Oct. 6, Garcia also sent the Bargaining Committee documents titled “Bargaining Committee Ground Rules.” The ground rules state Bargaining Committee members cannot speak during negotiation sessions with Harvard without permission from union leadership or speak to the press about bargaining.
The Bargaining Committee sent another email to University negotiators Monday detailing their qualms with these rules.
Rodriguez, the Law School custodian, said union members will write to Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow about the intra-union conflict. He added they are also appealing to SEIU, the parent organization of 32BJ based in New York City.
“If I have to go down there, I’m going to go down there,” Rodriguez said. “I want to get these things fixed.”

Harvard affiliates made a triumphant return to the streets of Boston Monday as they competed in the 125th running of the Boston Marathon and the first to take place in person since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The world’s oldest annual marathon broke out into the streets of Boston Monday, as roughly 20,000 runners trotted from Hopkinton, Mass. to Boylston Street. Though Monday’s race marked a continuation of the storied Boston event, this year’s iteration varied in several ways: the race was postponed from last spring due to a high rate of Covid-19 cases, and runners were required to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test.
Mariam A. Sousou ’23 had intended to run the race in April 2020, but the coronavirus outbreak foiled her plans. She said competing in the Boston Marathon Monday — 17 months after she had planned to — symbolized a return to normal.
“It was something that was only a few weeks away when we left campus,” she said. “It was really disappointing to have to go home and miss out on the marathon. And so now I’m back here and I’m doing the marathon and everything is just coming back to the way it was supposed to be and it’s really exciting.”
Other Harvard affiliates also found Monday’s race meaningful.
For Kevin K. Kurgat ’22, the race was a cultural homecoming. Kurgat’s family belongs to the Kalenjin ethnic group of Kenya — the same group that birthed legendary marathoner Eliud Kipchoge.
“I haven’t spent a lot of time in Kenya, but it feels like almost a chance to take part in something that is a huge thing in my culture and my tribe,” he said.
Sousou and Kurgat were two of four runners who ran the race as part of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge — an organization run by Harvard affiliates that raises money to help Boston-area families and children through running. The other runners include Cabot House Resident Tutor Eric Mibuari and Kirkland House Faculty Dean David J. Deming. Since its inception in 2006, the Harvard group has raised more than $832,000, according to its website.
Other Harvard affiliates earned spots in Monday’s marathon by running qualifying times in previous marathons — a notoriously difficult benchmark.
Winthrop House Tutor Irfan Mahmud ’16, who ran in Monday’s race, said he has felt a connection to Boston’s marathon since the event was the site of a terrorist attack in 2013. Two bombs detonated along the race path killed three spectators and injured 264 runners and fans. Mahmud said he was cheering on a friend at the finish line that year.
“It is something I will never forget, and I have been to nearly every Boston Marathon since,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “It was my dream to one day run the Boston Marathon itself, and now nearly a decade later, I was able to make that dream come true.”
Allegra B. Colman ’22, who used to compete for Harvard’s ski team, said the Boston Marathon provided her an opportunity to continue intense athletic competition while also raising money for a good cause. Colman said she raised money for Hale Education, a nonprofit that provides educational opportunities through the outdoors to students in Massachusetts.
“I can give back to the Boston outdoor community, do what I want to do, and have this really cool personal goal,” she said.
Though Human Evolutionary Biology Professor Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 had previously run the Boston Marathon 10 times, Monday’s race had particular meaning, he said.
“It’s wonderful to be back together and having people make that storied journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square,” he said. “It’s a sign of resilience and renaissance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four experts in emergency response and humanitarian aid discussed strategies to prevent and respond to humanitarian disasters in conflict-ridden environments Monday afternoon in the first of a series of webinars titled “From Crisis to Resilience,” co-hosted by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative.
Ronak B. Patel, a Harvard Medical School professor and director of the Urbanization and Crises program at the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative; Nahuel Arenas García, deputy chief of the Regional Office for the Americas and the Caribbean at the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction; Georgina Jordan, the head of emergency response at GOAL Global; and Patrick McManas, the head of development at Ireland’s embassy in Ethiopia, were all featured in the discussion.
David Donoghue, the former ambassador to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ireland’s former permanent representative to the United Nations, moderated the event.
Each panelist laid out examples of long-term frameworks for humanitarian response, particularly in fragile, already conflict-stricken areas that may lack the traditional political systems to organize aid.
Jordan and Patel both cited a study co-authored by Patel and published in Progress in Disaster Science on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction’s role and utility in disaster-stricken areas. That study explored how GOAL Global responded to the crisis in Syria and how the organization supported food production and water distribution systems in response to shortages during the conflict.
In an interview after the event, Jordan said the Syria case study reinforces the need to implement long-term disaster preparedness initiatives instead of just responding to short-term crises.
“People need food and water. But at the same time, we have to make sure we put in these longer term Disaster Risk Reduction systems,” Jordan said. “The bigger picture is to actually focus on the longer term, building the sustainability of the system.”
Jordan said this infrastructure is indicative of how countries can and do respond to crises.
“Hazards are natural, disasters are not,” Jordan said, citing how California’s earthquake emergency response system offers a protection often not found in other earthquake-prone regions.
The event was the first in a speaker series coordinated by the HHI, GOAL Global, The Rand Corporation, and University College London. The idea for the series originated in the collaboration that resulted in the Syrian Sendai Framework study.
Patel said the series intends “to reach those who are practitioners in this sector, in this area, but also the academic side to share best practices.”

Harvard Kennedy School fellow and journalist Maria A. Ressa received the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Friday for her work advancing freedom of the press and combating misinformation in the Philippines.
Ressa, a fall 2021 Joan Shorenstein fellow and Hauser Leader at the Kennedy School, shared the prize with Russian journalist Dmitry A. Muratov. She is the first Filipino to receive the Nobel Prize for her individual work.
In a Friday press release, the Norwegian Nobel Committee praised Ressa and Muratov for their efforts to “safeguard freedom of expression,” which they described as a “precondition for democracy and lasting peace.”
“Ms Ressa and Mr Muratov are receiving the Peace Prize for their courageous fight for freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia,” the statement reads. “At the same time, they are representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal in a world in which democracy and freedom of the press face increasingly adverse conditions.”
Through the Shorenstein fellowship, Ressa, who will arrive in Cambridge next month, will research the public and political roles of the media alongside fellow journalists and scholars.
Ressa served as CNN’s lead investigative reporter in Southeast Asia, overseeing bureaus in Manila and Jakarta for two decades. She later headed ABS-CBN News, a Philippines-based media company.
Ressa has also published two books about the rise of terrorism in Southeast Asia titled “Seeds of Terror: An Eyewitness Account of Al-Qaeda’s Newest Center” and “From Bin Laden to Facebook: 10 Days of Aduction, 10 Years of Terrorism.”
In 2012, Ressa co-founded Rappler, an online Filipino news source that has advocated for freedom of the press in the Philippines and exposed violence in the Filipino government’s anti-drug campaign — work the Nobel Committee described as “critical.”
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs” launched after he took office in 2016 and has resulted in thousands of deaths. Rappler reporters also claimed Duterte’s government harnessed Facebook to propagate pro-Duterte sentiment.
In one of the site’s most controversial moves, Rappler published a transcript of a call between Duterte and President Trump, during which Duterte criticized North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The Filipino government responded by posting a video labeling Ressa as a “traitor” for potentially making the Philippines a North Korean target.
In a conversation with the Nieman Foundation in March 2020, Ressa said her experience as a target of social media misinformation enhanced her investigative reporting at Rappler.
“What that did for me is it changed my entire view of the world, through first-hand experience,” Ressa said. “And isn’t that what journalism is? In the battle for truth, journalism is advocacy — because we will fight for the facts.”
Shorenstein Center Director and former TIME editor-in-chief Nancy R. Gibbs lauded Ressa’s persistence in an interview.
“She embodies the courage and the values — and the resilience and the fearlessness — that has been critically important for these journalists, particularly those who are operating in countries with hostile governments who have harassed them to the point of arrest and threats,” she said.
Shorenstein Center Executive Director Laura Manley said she believes Ressa’s award reaffirms the press’s critical role in fighting disinformation.
“It is acknowledging the fact that human rights and peace doesn’t just manifest through the traditional means of humanitarian assistance like it used to, and that thinking about fake news, and about mis- and disinformation is something that can really contribute — or take away — from the potential of peaceful societies,” she said.
Harvard students of Filipino descent also praised the recent Nobel awardee.
Jose Marco C. “Marcky” Antonio ’25, who emigrated from the Philippines at age 12, called Ressa an “inspiration to many Filipinos,” adding that the Prize could bolster awareness about the “atmosphere of fear” created by Duterte’s government.
“The Nobel Peace Prize award is especially important in helping her work get recognized by the international community more so than it already has,” he said.
Christian Go, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Singapore currently taking classes at Harvard, said the internationally-acclaimed award grants a “new level of power” to Ressa in her struggle against Duterte’s administration.
“At the moment, they’re still very congratulatory toward Ressa,” said Go, who grew up in the Philippines. “But I’m pretty sure that is going to tip to the other side fairly quickly.”
Nieman Foundation for Journalism curator and former Chicago Tribune editor-in-chief Anne Marie Lipinski described Ressa as “relentless.”
“Duterte has personally attacked Maria and her work and abused his office by using it to undermine fair journalism,” Lipinski said in an interview. “And she hasn’t blinked. Not once.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Live performances, arts and crafts, and street food spilled into Harvard Square Sunday as the Harvard Square Business Association hosted its 42nd Annual Oktoberfest.
After organizing a four-day virtual event last year, the HSBA celebrated the yearly tradition in person this year, with the goal of spotlighting Square businesses still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic.
While the time-honored HONK! Parade – which typically accompanies Oktoberfest – did not take place this year due to health and safety concerns, Oktoberfest still drew a large crowd.
A musically diverse line-up of artists – including Vibe Check, the Bullock Brothers, Hot Tamale Brass Band, and mariachi singer Veronica Robles – performed at the event.
Simon Eber – a member of Cambridge-based band Vibe Check – said Oktoberfest was the largest crowd the band had ever played for, something he hopes will give them more “traction.”
“This is by far the coolest gig we’ve ever played,” Eber said. “To come out and see so many people and have them be so into the performance was just a great experience.”
“This is like a whole new level, it feels really like a special moment for the group,” Eber added.
Next to the live entertainment, local artists operated booths selling handmade items, from resin trinkets to wallets to jewelry.
Alan Casso, who has represented Revels — a Watertown performing arts company — at the Harvard Square Oktoberfest for over 30 years, described the festival as “terrific.”
“I think this might be a bit of a scaled-down version, but we’re getting a lot of traffic,” he said.
Casso said the pandemic “took a toll” on performing arts companies.
“It’s really vital that we get back up and running this year to a more healthy state, and build our way up to more normalcy,” he added. “We have hopes for this year that people will be coming back to indoor events like the Christmas Revels.”
Resin and abstract artist Charlotte A. Kennedy attended Oktoberfest Sunday for the first time as a vendor. Kennedy said she sold a few of her pieces during the festivities.
The Rotary Club of Cambridge featured chalk murals created by local artists in their “Chalk-on-the-Walk” art installation, which transformed Church St. for the occasion.
Nicholas Ghilardi, a local artist with over 10 years of experience in chalk art, drew an enormous blue cartoon dragon for the street art exhibition.
Ghilardi, who has participated in Oktoberfest in previous years, said turnout was “a little slower” than usual.
“They kind of kept it a little lower key because of everything that’s going on,” he said.
Many Harvard students also attended the festivities in the Square.
Eric Zheng ’23 discovered the festival while he was on a walk.
“I didn’t know this was going on,” he said. “I think it’s really neat, it’s an interesting way to bring more business into the area, less car traffic, and more actual walking and in-person experiences, so I think they should do this more often.”
Victor Ghosh ’25 described Oktoberfest as a “really great experience.”
“It reminds me of back home in New York, this is how it would look, exactly like this,” he said. “I love the live entertainment.”
Ghosh added, however, that he found the vendor prices at the festival a bit high and noted that they could have been a “financial barrier” for students and residents.
“I feel like stuff is a little overpriced, though,” he said. “This kind of stuff wouldn’t be as expensive if you get it online or something like that, so it’s a little financial barrier for people, but overall, the experience has been really good.”
Abia S. Khan ’24 said Oktoberfest was a “nice change of pace” for the Square.
“Especially after a year and a half of isolation, this is a great way to build community,” she said. “I lived on campus all year, and this is the most people I’ve ever seen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 15, 2021 at 3:30 p.m.
A review of tenure processes within the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences found that the tenure-track system is “structurally sound” but recommended adjustments in certain aspects of the system — particularly surrounding the stages of associate professor review and the use of ad hoc committees — to address “mistrust and low morale” in the process.
The Tenure-Track Review Committee — charged in fall 2020 by FAS Dean Claudine Gay with reviewing the FAS’s tenure promotion system to make recommendations for improvement by February 2021 — released a 105-page final report on Tuesday.
The Committee — chaired by Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Hopi Hoekstra — also included 10 other professors from across the FAS’s Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science Divisions, as well as the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Over the course of eight months, the Committee conducted outreach to tenured and tenure-track faculty, department chairs, and administrators across the FAS and SEAS. Ultimately, they found that “there is a lack of trust in, and a low morale, about the tenure process” among ladder faculty.
Specific factors the Committee cited as increasing uncertainty and stress around the tenure review processes included the “murky area” of how decisions on tenure are made by the FAS Committee on Appointments and Promotions and the ad hoc committee, as well as a “lack of clarity” regarding the standards by which faculty will be assessed.
“Faculty anxiety about the tenure-track system has also been exacerbated by some recent, high-profile, unsuccessful tenure cases whose outcome was described by colleagues as surprising to the department,” the Committee wrote.
The Committee — citing data from the Office for Faculty Affairs — wrote that the number of cases that fail after the ad hoc is “relatively small.” In a 10-year span between AY 2009-2010 and AY 2019-2020, 23 of 163 tenure promotion cases — or 14 percent — failed after an ad hoc review, according to the report.
Faculty and students have previously criticized how the FAS’s tenure review processes treat scholars of color. The tenure denial of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña in fall 2019 ultimately led to more than 100 faculty demanding a formal review of the tenure system.
The Committee — formed following those demands — wrote that while the account of the “lived experience of the tenure-track system” may appear to suggest the FAS’s tenure review procedures are “broken,” the Committee overall found the tenure-track system to be “performing adequately.”
“We believe the system is structurally sound: it has checks and balances (e.g., internal and external evaluations, and four levels of assessment, from the review committee to the department to CAP to the ad hoc committee) and is designed to ground promotion decisions in ample evidence,” the Committee wrote.
The Committee added that while there is room to improve the system, “stress, frustration, and disappointment will always be a part of faculty members’ experience.” They pointed to a 70 percent success rate in tenure review as an indicator of the system’s effectiveness.
“The bar is high for tenure at Harvard, tenure is not guaranteed, and not everyone will get tenure,” the Committee wrote in the report’s preamble.
In its report, the Committee recommended that the review for promotion to associate professor, which happens in a faculty member’s fourth year, be “treated as a thorough rehearsal for a possible tenure review.”
“Promotion data and colleagues’ comments make clear that the associate review is currently neither a rigorous selection mechanism nor, in many cases, adequate preparation for the candidate en route to tenure,” the Committee wrote.
The Committee issued guidance on “aligning” the associate review with the later tenure review and also suggested making the associate review “significantly more rigorous in terms of feedback, to truly help the candidate to prepare for tenure.”
Some of the most outspoken criticism of Harvard’s tenure process has centered around the ad hoc committee stage.  Chaired by the University president or provost, ad hoc committees, whose composition is secret, deliberate on FAS tenure case decisions, after which the president will make a final decision. Ultimately, the president’s decision may be communicated to the candidate and the candidate’s department without any explanation.
Because the ad hoc review is at the University level, it was not directly in the Committee’s charge, but the Committee wrote that they nonetheless investigated it “given our colleagues’ concerns.” Ultimately, they found that the “black box” nature of the ad hoc “erodes faculty trust in the tenure-track system.”
“Because little feedback about what happened in the ad hoc stage gets back to the department after a tenure case is decided, tenured faculty report that they lack information that can help them to more effectively mentor other tenure-track colleagues,” the Committee wrote.
While the Committee reaffirmed the confidential nature of the ad hoc process, they recommended further review of the ad hoc process with a goal of “repairing frayed trust in the tenure-track system.”
“We recommend that the University consider examining the ad hoc process, with an eye towards assessing whether any productive changes can be made to increase (within reason and with due concern for confidentiality) transparency about its processes and the feedback that is provided to departments after tenure cases,” they recommended.
In addition, the Committee suggested formalizing assessment measures of teaching, advising, mentoring, and service within the tenure review process, recommended increasing the flexibility of external letter requirements in candidate assessment, and put forward guidelines to better review interdisciplinary scholars.
The Committee also recommended maintaining certain controversial aspects of the tenure process at Harvard. Chiefly, the report suggests that Harvard should maintain the current timeline of tenure review and continue offering tenure only at the full professor rank, even though many other universities tenure at the associate professor level.
“The time to tenure is already long, relative to some of our peers, and extending the term would make us less competitive in hiring and retaining colleagues,” the report reads. “Conversely, shortening the tenure clock could curtail the development of novel, risky, and interdisciplinary research, disadvantage women and faculty of color, and result in less data needed to make the most informed tenure decisions.”
In an email to faculty on Tuesday accompanying the report, Gay thanked the Committee’s members for their dedication.
“I applaud TTRC for their extraordinary work, including extensive outreach to faculty colleagues and deans across the FAS, careful review of data, thoughtful deliberation, and a comprehensive report documenting their recommendations for my review,” she wrote.
Gay emphasized the report’s call for “a new level of shared responsibility for the tenure-track system among the tenured faculty.” She wrote that this will require increased senior faculty engagement with tenure-track colleagues beyond the scope of promotion reviews.
Gay further wrote that the FAS will begin implementation of the Committee’s recommendations this fall, with a timeline of two years for full implementation.
“The FAS’s tenure-track system is central to our efforts to build a world-class faculty,” Gay wrote. “Strengthening this system is one of the most important things that we can do.”
CORRECTION: October 15, 2021
A previous version of this article misstated that ad hoc committees make a final decision in certain tenure cases. In fact, the ad hoc committee deliberates on the candidate before the University President makes the final decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard was just barely outclassed by one of the best offenses in the country on Saturday evening, as it fell 5-4 to No. 24 Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. After conceding five goals in the first half, the Crimson nearly pulled off an unthinkable comeback by scoring four and dominating the second slate, but the resurgence proved to be too little, too late.
It was a tale of two halves for Harvard (4-4-2, 0-1-1 Ivy League), who was not able to match the pace set by Cornell (7-1-1, 2-0-0 Ivy) in the first half after the Big Red showed why it is the third-best offense in the country. Despite Harvard roaring back in the second 45, Cornell’s first-half dominance proved to be enough for it to limp over the finish line. With the loss, Harvard will likely need to win the rest of its Ivy League games and get some help from the rest of the division to catch Cornell at the top of the conference standings.
“Conceding five times in the manner that we did was disappointing, but, like anything, it’s how you respond,” said sophomore defender Nik White of the night. “We reflected as a group during halftime and almost secured one of the best comebacks I’ve ever been a part of or seen. I’m proud of the character we showed, but we ultimately never should have allowed it to get the point it did.”
Harvard started the game with some intensity, creating the first real chance of the game in the 13th minute through its talented first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti. Arlotti picked up the ball after it was knocked down by junior forward Martin Vician and drove into the Cornell box, forcing a last-ditch challenge from behind from Cornell’s last defender. The tackle got a lot of Arlotti before getting the ball, but the referee was not convinced, and play continued.
Cornell opened the scoring with its first real chance of the game just moments later in the 15th minute, after driving down the right side with numbers. The ensuing cross flew just over the head of first-year defender Jan Riecke, and the ball fell to an open Cornell striker who took a touch and volleyed home to make the score 1-0.
The floodgates began to open for Cornell following the first goal as the Big Red showed why its offense is one of the best in the country. In the 22nd minute, Cornell delivered a perfect cross from a free-kick midway through Harvard’s half, which was met with a powerful header into the opposite corner for 2-0.
Just moments later, Cornell won another free kick, this one coming just outside the box. It was taken by senior midfielder Tyler Bagley, who curled into the top corner with his weaker left foot for a 3-0 lead, leaving junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson no chance in goal.
While this third goal showed Cornell’s individual quality, its fifth could only be described as spectacular. Harvard left the back post unmarked on a corner in the 42nd minute, and Cornell’s junior defender Connor Drought took notice, curling the ball over everyone and into the opposite corner to score directly from the corner. At this point, Harvard looked like it might concede five more in the second half.
Coach Josh Shapiro’s halftime team talk must have been something special, as Harvard looked like a different side in the second half. It pulled a goal back in the 52nd minute and came close to grabbing a second multiple times in the following five minutes. Sophomore defender Nik White got up to challenge a well-delivered corner from sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge, but his header was blocked and fell to his feet, and he smashed the ball home to pull one back for Harvard.
“After a bad start, at halftime, we said that we can't give up,” Vician said of the turnaround. “No matter what the result is, we play for Harvard and we fight for Harvard.”
The Crimson grabbed a second goal in the 67th minute, after executing a near-perfect counterattack. Riecke went long from the Harvard box, and the two strikers reversed their usual roles, with Arlotti flicking the ball perfectly onto Vician, who found himself all alone in the Cornell side of the field. Vician surged forward and made no mistake, finishing the one-on-one smoothly to bring the game to 5-2 before grabbing the ball and bringing it back to the center circle.
Harvard scored again in the 80th minute after shots from senior forward Alfred Perez and Vician forced a quick double-save from the Cornell keeper. Sophomore forward Ale Gutierrez was waiting in the box as he picked the defender’s pocket on the rebound and fired home to give the Crimson the slightest chance at 5-3 with ten minutes to play.
In the 85th minute, Harvard brought the game within one score after a long throw-in was flicked on by Vician at the front post, with Arlotti rising highest in the middle to knock the ball home and bring the scoreline to 5-4 with five minutes to play.
Harvard nearly grabbed the elusive fifth goal just 45 seconds after scoring its fourth, as Perez found senior forward Nico Garcia-Morillo in space at the edge of the box. His shot sailed wide, and Cornell took advantage, spending the rest of the match holding the ball in the corner to run out the clock.
“This game again showed that we can compete with the elite — we have the talent and depth. It’s now a matter of looking ahead and finishing the season strong,” White said. “We have to give everything to secure as many wins from the final six games as possible.”
Harvard will now host Brown at home this Saturday, with kickoff coming at 7 p.m. on Jordan Field.
“The second half showed us that we can dominate even a team that is currently ranked 24th in the country,” said Vician of the second half. “Now, we have to continue and show the same spirit from the second half on Saturday against Brown.”
