After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will hold a second graduate student unionization election to determine whether or not eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants can form a union and collectively bargain with the University.
The mandate to hold a second election came after the National Labor Relations Board unsealed and counted 193 ballots remaining from Harvard’s first unionization election, held Nov. 2016, on Thursday morning.
The final tally—which showed 1,526 votes against unionization and 1,396 in favor, including the challenged ballots—confirmed the original Nov. 2016 tally against unionization, meaning the regional NLRB, the University administration, and the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers will move forward with a second election.
Per NLRB procedure, the University could not hold a second election until the votes left over from the Nov. 2016 election were unsealed and counted, provided the final tally did not certify the union.
History Ph.D. candidate Samuel S. Klug, who said his vote was among those counted Thursday, said he and other graduate students are thrilled by the prospect of a new election.
“I’m excited for our new election and confident that a majority will vote yes. I think it’s clear that support for the union is growing, which helped us, along with other organized grad workers who helped us, defeat the grad tax,” Klug said. “We’re excited to build on that momentum and the momentum at the end of this process with the NLRB.”
The decision follows more than a year of legal battles between graduate student union organizers and University administration. After the Nov. 2016 election, lawyers for HGSU-UAW contested the result, charging that the list of eligible voters the University circulated before the election were inadequate, so the results should be deemed invalid and another election held.
In July 2017, the regional NLRB officially agreed with the HGSU-UAW, ruling to invalidate the results of the Nov. 2016 election on the grounds that the University failed to provide complete and accurate voter lists under NLRB regulations. Harvard later appealed that ruling, but the national NLRB rejected that appeal in December.
Following the final result Thursday, Paul R. Curran, University director of labor and employee relations, wrote an email to Harvard affiliates affirming the University’s commitment to holding a fair election in the coming months.
“As we move forward with a second election, it is critically important to consider again the issues at stake and engage in a robust conversation about the potential impact of unionization,” he wrote.
Harvard and the HGSU-UAW each have one week to contest the results of the final ballot count in accordance with NLRB regulations. Doing so could forestall the second election, which the regional NLRB will schedule if there is no challenge to the updated count.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An impressive 23-2 first quarter run propelled Harvard women’s basketball past La Salle an onto a 70-61 win at Lavietes Pavilion Wednesday afternoon.
The Crimson’s first quarter run, anchored by 10 points from junior guard Madeline Raster, provided Harvard (8-6, 0-1 Ivy)  with momentum and a lead it would never relinquish.
“We had a ton of energy off the bench,” said sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm, of the first quarter performance. “We were able to create a lot of offense from our defense. We read passing lanes very well, got a bunch of steals, and transitioned well on offense.”
Wednesday’s tilt against the Explorers (5-11, 0-3 Atlantic 10), was the final non-conference game of the season, affording the Crimson an opportunity to improve on the issues that contributed to a 63-56 conference opening loss to Dartmouth.
La Salle entered Wednesday’s matchup on a skid, having lost four straight contests and six of its past seven games by double digits. However, the Explorers recorded an impressive seven-point win over two-time defending Ivy League Champions, Penn, earlier in the season, demonstrating their potential to be a dangerous team.
Plagued by poor shooting and turnover-prone basketball in Hanover, Harvard showed few of the same symptoms against La Salle, winning the turnover battle and shooting a season-high 55 percent from the field. The Crimson also shot 37 percent from beyond the arc, seven percentage points above its season average.
Reducing turnovers was key to Harvard’s success on Wednesday afternoon, a theme which has remained consistent throughout the season. Although the team finished with 17 turnovers, only five came in the first half, when the Crimson was able to build its lead.
“We worked a lot on limiting turnovers this week in practice,” Boehm said. “I think we did a little bit of a better job this game, but if we want to beat Dartmouth we have to continue to improve on that.”
Harvard featured a balanced attack against the Explorers, with four players scoring in double digits. Boehm and junior guard Sydney Skinner led the way, combining to score 35 of the Crimson’s 70 points.
“We shared the ball, we took great shots, we played tough defense. I thought we were doing some great stuff,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “For the most part, I thought we played very well.”
Boehm shot an impressive 9-for-11 from the field—her most efficient performance of the season—stuffing the stat sheet with six rebounds, three steals, and three blocks.
Wednesday’s performance against La Salle was much needed for the sophomore forward, after a frustrating game at Dartmouth in which she scored eight points in just 21 minutes due to foul trouble.
“I tried this game not to get dumb, early fouls, especially with their post play,” Boehm said. “To go out [and play 36 minutes] was definitely positive for me.”
After falling behind 23-10 at the end of the first quarter, the Explorers were able to string together several runs, cutting the deficit to single digits on multiple occasions.
However, La Salle was ultimately unable to climb back to level footing, due to careless ball handling and converting just 1-of-13 from three point range. The Explorers committed 20 turnovers and struggled to chase the hosts all afternoon, never leading after 6-4.
Skinner was essential in quelling the numerous Explorers’ comeback efforts, providing a season-high 16 points off of the bench. The Plano, Texas., native chipped in three rebounds and shot five-of-six from the free-throw line, while providing 21 minutes of steady play at the guard position.
Beating the Explorers allowed Harvard to extend its undefeated record at Lavietes Pavilion to 5-0, a pattern the team hopes to continue entering Ivy League play.
The Crimson will have a week and a half off before taking on Dartmouth on January 20th in Cambridge, looking to maintain its undefeated record at home.
“Coaches love this break,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s a chance for us to zone in on some stuff we need to work on.”
The matchup against the Big Green looms large, with Harvard looking to avenge its loss in Hanover and record its first Ivy League win of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than a minute left on the clock sophomore forward Seth Towns ended a scoring drought that had lasted the entire half with a layup. After leading Harvard with 16 of its 28 first half points, the sophomore hadn’t made a field goal since before intermission.
The layup gave Harvard its first tie since the break—knotting the Crimson and host Wofford at 62 with 55 ticks to play. The guests had trailed by as many as nine in the half.
The late game heroics would fall just short, however, as Harvard (6-10, 1-0 Ivy) would give the Terriers (11-5, 1-1 SoCon) back-to-back offensive rebounds on their final possession before Towns would foul and send senior guard Derrick Brooks to the line for two.
Brooks would miss the first but make the second to give the Crimson a chance at the buzzer. With seven seconds left on the clock, Towns ran the length of the floor and managed to get off a left-handed shot, but the ball wouldn’t find the bottom of the net as Harvard fell, 63-62.
“It was a tremendous game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought both teams competed really hard and I was really proud of our kids for fighting and clawing against a very good team and program.”
Despite the second half struggles, Towns finished with a game-high 20 points to go with four rebounds and four assists.
Though the Crimson trailed for the entirety of the second half, the second-ever iteration of the bow tie and button-down affair between the two programs began as a back-and-forth effort from both teams.
Sophomore Christian Juzang got the start in place of the injured Bryce Aiken—Harvard’s leading scorer—and the Crimson took the early lead off a jumper from Juzang and a three from Towns. Much like they would the rest of the night, the Terriers responded from deep.
After the five points from Harvard to start the game, Wofford would go on a 16-5 run to take a 16-10 lead with 13:26 to go in the first. Of the first 16 points for the hosts, all but four would come from beyond the arc. All told, the Terriers would shoot a blistering 58 percent from three through the first twenty minutes.
Coming off a game against the Big Green in which the Crimson appeared to have finally found its rhythm from deep, Harvard struggled from three—much like it has all season.
The Crimson shot an abysmal 2-of-14 from beyond the arc in the first half and finished the game shooting 19 percent from three. The Terriers, for their part, thrived from three-point land—shooting 42 percent from deep, a mark better than their overall field goal percentage.
“Unfortunately, we didn’t shoot the ball very well from the three point line, which really hurt us, but I thought we gave great effort, great energy, and had a shot to win it at the end with Seth Towns, and the ball in his hands,” Amaker said. “Couldn’t ask for much more than that.”
Despite the onslaught from the perimeter, the Crimson kept up early with timely baskets inside and second chance opportunities. After the early run from Wofford, the Crimson steered clear of a zone defense that was being picked apart from the Terriers, and decided to move the ball inside on the other end.
The Crimson would go on to outscore Wofford 30-10 in the paint on the game while keeping the Terriers in check on defense and on the offensive glass. To Harvard’s dismay, two of Wofford’s six offensive rebounds on the game would come on their game-winning possession, but the Crimson managed to tally 11 offensive boards for 12 points on the evening.
For the Terriers, junior guard Fletcher Magee tallied a team-high 19 points, seven rebounds, and four assists on 5-of-18 shooting.
“Holding this team to 63 points, that’s a tremendous defensive effort,” Amaker said. “We didn’t play as well late, by putting them on the foul line, but I thought we gave great effort and energy and defended the kid, Fletcher Magee, who’s a tremendous shooting scorer and I thought we did a tremendous job on him throughout, couldn’t ask for much more.”

Death, taxes, and “Are you ready to go back the cold weather, sweetie?”
The winter holiday is a time during which students travel near and far to rekindle friendships and spend time with loved ones. It is also a time during which one’s sanity is jeopardized by persistent questions regarding how “gosh-darn cold it is up there.” If I had a nickel for every time an aunt or uncle of mine asked if it was cold in Cambridge, I would be able to comfortably afford Clover. In order to escape this conversational Groundhog Day, we have compiled some other conversation topics to transition to after Auntie Margaret offers to buy you a Canada Goose at the dinner table.
Lie about the presidential search
Your family has been paying as much attention to this as you have—not a whole lot. Use the line “Have you heard that the administration has considered replacing Drew Faust with [name of person with more than 5 million Instagram followers]?” This will help you develop some improvisational skills and could lead to some really interesting conversations. For example, Uncle Jorge was dumbfounded by how Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson could possibly be applying for the job, especially considering that Jumanji was filmed so recently.
Subtly note that you participated in Primal Scream
Saying “Yeah, it was especially cold when we went streaking…” will turn your mother into the most concerned human being in the world, but it is totally worth it if you consider that it is a free pass out of all future questions regarding the cold weather in Cambridge. Yes, you will have to deal with more frequent check-ins regarding whether or not you have done anything incriminating. We, however, believe that this is a fair tradeoff.
Try to discuss Black Mirror without sounding crazy
	
This obviously is reserved for people who have watched the show, but the mental gymnastics that goes into hyping up this show without coming across as insane is far more complex than anything Blitzstein could possibly test you on. This should take you about ten minutes to do, and your cousins will probably be so freaked out by your efforts that they will walk away and cut the conversation off.
While these conversation topic shifts are not guaranteed to relieve you of the “weather conversation” every time, they will certainly make your family believe that your collegiate experience is far more dynamic than it really is. The only thing more uncomfortable than the cold weather is an awkward conversation with a distant family member. Soldier on, students.
