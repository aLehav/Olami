After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday morning, I received an email from the dean of the Kennedy School, Douglas W. Elmendorf. “Please vote!” read the subject line. The leader of Harvard’s public policy school then proceeded to rally the HKS community to participate in the upcoming election next week: “I encourage all eligible students, staff, and faculty to take the time to vote. Although the Kennedy School will be open as usual next Tuesday, I believe that fulfilling your civic responsibility is compatible with fulfilling your responsibilities to the School.” He then implores, but does not require, professors to make informal accommodations for students who arrive late or miss class in order to vote.
On its face, encouraging voting is a positive and productive step for a dean in Elmendorf’s position to take. As communications chair for the Harvard Votes Challenge at the Kennedy School, an initiative to achieve 90 percent student voter registration at the school, I was stunned to learn that in 2014, the last “midterm” election, just 64 percent of eligible Harvard students were registered to vote and a mere 23.6 percent turned out to vote. Across graduate schools at the University, just 16.4 percent of those eligible engaged in our single most important civic responsibility. While I am proud we exceeded our 90 percent registration target last week — and the school was incredibly supportive of this initiative — a deeper consideration of Elmendorf’s email reveals a glaring missed opportunity.
The Kennedy School and the wider university should cancel classes on Election Day this year and every year after. Prioritizing voting in this way is important for a multiplicity of reasons. First, big picture, if Harvard’s goal is to educate future leaders across all sectors, performing basic civic duties is an integral first step — surely education is not simply about ideas, but also actions. It is far too easy for students to get swept away in the Ivy League bubble and forget about the communities around us and the communities we are from. While perhaps the Kennedy School of Government has an unique onus to live the values of public leadership by remaining closed on Election Day, the official mission of Harvard College is “to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” While it’s true students can find time to vote, we know that each additional barrier to voting decreases participation. Cancelling classes sends a message that Harvard is prioritizing voting and eliminates a real reason that students may be too busy or too tired to go to the polls. While ideally students themselves would take every step possible to engage in this civic process, we know this is not the case — and Harvard can use smart policy to change that.
Moreover, Harvard employs over 15,000 staff and faculty members. Only 56 percent of the voting age population went to the polls in the 2016 election — and non-voters cited being too busy or having a scheduling conflict as the second biggest impediment to casting a ballot. Harvard has the resources and autonomy to empower its workforce to express their political will. In fact, it is the very workers who keep the University running who may have the least voice and seek to gain or lose most from election outcomes.
Finally, Harvard can lead by example. For decades, Americans have called for Election Day to be a national holiday. After all, democracy and civic action are central to the American ethos and narrative, though in practice we fall incredibly short. Elite institutions, for better or worse, have cultural capital to set standards and test best practices. If Harvard gives its nearly 40,000 community members Election Day off this year or next, studies the impact of the decision, and starts to build a movement, our society will be better off. I deeply encourage University President Lawrence S. Bacow to take this bold step forward — one of the many required to reorient the university not only towards the best ideas, but engagement with the world around us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Trump promising military action at the southern border in response to a highly publicized migrant “caravan,” it’s easy to let our historical amnesia set in about the recentness of the border and our fears of Mexican and Central American crossers.
Between 1846 and 1853, we had no recognizable boundary with Mexico — this due to a mix of factors including Native American raids against surveyor camps, an unexpected death in the joint border-planning committee, and poorly drafted map materials. Between that time and Mexican “repatriation” in the 1930s — when our government sent many Mexican-Americans south to their “historic” homeland — impromptu migration northward was not uncommon, whether for farm-work for other opportunity. The United States did not have any quota or cap on Mexican migration like it did for other regions.
All the way into the 1960s, it was common for Mexicans to enter the country under seasonal farming permits from the “Bracero Program,” which accommodated historical migration patterns based around the agriculture economy. Certain Native American bands continue to border-hop to this day under protections designed to preserve traditional ranges of movement. (A 1983 law secured these rights for the Texas Kickapoo. A similar policy applies for Arizona’s Tohono O’odham people.)
Call these pictures what you will; they are certainly not the hermetically sealed border of GOP fantasy. And understanding this paves the way for an even shorter history of other global borderlands.
Before 1957, almost none of sub-Saharan Africa existed under its current political arrangement. Where borders did boast official legal status, their defense was often impossible in practice, and the lines themselves often assumed the loyalty of their inside occupants. Such was the case in Namibia (formerly “South West Africa”) under South African rule, where most of the 900-mile northern border was demarcated by indigenous tribal reserves.
In Asia, it was much the same story. The first country to gain independence was Yemen in 1918. It was only a small sliver of desert (and a fraction of today’s Yemen).
Everywhere, borders are — as they always have been — hasty, imaginative affairs. Yet, perhaps paradoxically, they conjure real, and violent, worldviews from their faulty premises.
Underlying the problem is a worldview based on neat divisions. The hope to perfectly regulate human movement is an unfortunate dream of the modern state, and where it comes nearest to reality, its effects are visibly disfiguring. The Korean “Demilitarized Zone” is perhaps today’s only example of a perfect border: heavily guarded and completely surveilled. On either side, one is totally protected against the contagion of the other.
This sense of protection comes at great human cost. At our own southern border, 412 migrants died in 2017, adding to 341,000 who were taken into temporary or long-term custody. In 2016, the total figure for apprehended persons was nearly double that (the lower figures after 2016 reflect a combination of demoralized potential emigrants and new opportunity in Mexico). Since then, custody camps for Central American refugees have sprouted up in the borderlands, like halfway houses for those fleeing war, sexual violence, and poverty. The accounts of living conditions in these camps are distressing. Residents speak of overcrowding, illness, ridiculing from guards, and jail-like conditions. Many detainees end up getting deported after weeks or months in stir.
A similar (if more extreme) phenomenon is unfolding in Xinjiang, China’s westernmost administrative region (bordering former-Soviet Central Asia). There, the government is waging a demographic war, using a system of detention camps to house, reeducate, and sometimes torture Uyghurs, a transnational Muslim minority. Estimates put the total number of detainees at one million (high-end estimates suggest three times that).
If the problems of “border logic” aren’t obvious, consider the point raised by Bengali historian Sudipta Kaviraj that states view borders as ends in themselves, often fighting to secure control over empty, barren, remote, or depopulated space. Such was the case in the now-forgotten Paraguayan War, when Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay launched a bloody invasion of Paraguay over empty interior regions of South America. The pretext, sure enough, was an untenable border line left over from the colonial era.
My own studies focus on the history of the US-Mexico borderlands, so naturally I am partial to (and especially concerned by) that case. It is nonetheless an undeniably global problem that we are facing.
Where we can effect any sort of policy change — at the polls this November, for instance — we must move to do so. That means voting for Democrats who will advocate uncompromisingly for an end to refugee detention, an overhauled immigration system, and aid for countries sending migrants. It also means demanding the kind of international coalition-building that can make it unfashionable to commit border genocide — in Myanmar, Gaza, Xinjiang, or here at home.
If we can’t defuse the bomb of nationalism, the risks might be unprecedented. One scenario — a worst case — is what the Hungarian historian Istvan Hont ominously called, in a moment of commendable clarity, the “permanent crisis of a divided mankind.”
We should try our best to avoid that outcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visited Harvard on his tour of the United States, a visit that was only the latest in a long string of ties between Harvard and the Saudi royal family. In 2005, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, another prominent member of the royal family, donated $20 million to the University. This donation established the Alwaleed Islamic Studies Program and created three professorships in his name. Harvard’s ties with Saudi Arabia don’t end there — The Saudi royal family funds at least two programs at the Kennedy School, and it even sponsors leadership courses held during Harvard’s summer programs.
In light of Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and its egregious human rights violations elsewhere — including its ties to the 9/11 attack and its actions in Yemen that have resulted in a devastating worst humanitarian crisis — we believe it is necessary for Harvard to act. Harvard must publicly condemn the killing of Khashoggi, but that is not enough. The University must go a step forward and critically assess its relationship with the Saudi regime, and begin by making its history and current involvement with the Saudis public.
We have previously opined that Harvard’s funding sources should be evaluated in a nuanced way, and we recognize that Harvard cannot and should not unequivocally reject donations from all controversial donors. Furthermore, we are not equating other controversial donors with the brutal Saudi regime. However, when it comes to funding from controversial sources, Harvard’s transparency problem is obvious and can be easily corrected. Even if Harvard accepts money from such places, it is still crucial for the University to be as open as possible with its financial sources. Thus, we demand that when it comes to funding, Harvard improve transparency across the board, specifically by making public lists of sources and direct funding.
Furthermore, by associating itself with the Saudi regime, Harvard – one of the best universities in the world – runs the risk of legitimizing both the authoritarian nature of the regime and the brutal policies it carries out abroad. By continuing to strengthen this relationship, Harvard turns a blind eye to Saudi atrocities. For Harvard to continue to cultivate close ties with a regime almost certainly engaged in serious human rights abuses and war crimes is clearly unethical, and the University must do better. Furthermore, the secretive nature of these ties seems to reflect the University’s own qualms about the optics of this situation. Thus, it seems clear that rather than continuing to build a strong relationship with the Saudis, Harvard should take a critical look at the money it is benefiting from.
Finally, we wish to honor Khashoggi for his courage and determination to speak the truth, for which he paid the ultimate price. The murder of a columnist for speaking out against injustice is a direct affront to the values that journalists and editorial boards such as this one hold dear. It is as critical as ever to continue speaking truth to power and exercising our freedom of speech — especially at a time when leaders from Riyadh to Moscow to Washington work their hardest to make that challenging. We hope that Harvard will consider its own motto in the light of Khashoggi’s murder, and will honor him adequately. More than anything, we hope that Harvard will reconsider its ties to the Saudi regime and will seek to ensure that all ties that the University builds truly further our commitment to veritas.

I had never before seen a trademarked sandwich. But a few weeks ago, as I was walking past the Clover on Massachusetts Avenue, I noticed that the whiteboard outside the restaurant announced — in bolded letters — the arrival of their “Impossible™ Sausage, Egg + Cheese sandwich.” I paused.
According to Clover’s website, the restaurant has recently adopted Impossible™ Foods meat. Impossible™ Foods is a vegan food company that, as their website explains, “delivers all the flavor, aroma and beefiness of meat from cows,” except via vegetables. They mix together textured wheat protein, potato protein, coconut oil, something called heme, niacin, konjac gum, xanthan gum, and “natural flavors” into a vegan replacement for ground beef. Clover chefs shape this plant-based meat into faux-sausage patties and vegan meatballs. But I did not know any of this when I walked past the sign.
I haven’t had beef since I was 10 because I dislike the taste and sensation. My last memory of eating beef dates to dinner one night in the fifth grade. I remember trying to chew an overcooked chunk of steak but feeling like my jaw was too weak to rip the flesh. Although the cow was dead, it seemed like it was fighting against my jaw and somehow winning. By the time I finally broke down the chunk, it was already flavorless, drained of salt and blood. When I eventually chewed it down to a swallowable bite, I could feel my body’s difficulty integrating the foreign flesh with my own. I felt uncomfortably aware that the flesh I just ate would be slowly dissolved by stomach acids until it lined my arteries with pebbles of foreign fat.
But, as I stood outside Clover, I had to admit it: I was intrigued by the sandwich. I wondered how closely this substitute could mimic real meat. So, I walked into Clover around ten in the morning to order an “Impossible TM Sausage, Egg + Cheese” sandwich.
The restaurant was almost entirely empty. The cashier immediately me towards her as soon as I stepped inside. I ordered my sandwich by asking for “that impossible sandwich but without cheese.” Observing the way I stumbled over the word “impossible,” the cashier asked if I had ordered it before.
“No, I haven’t. Does it taste like actual meat?” I inquired.
“I think it depends on how much meat you eat.”
We stopped talking while she entered my order into an iPhone.
“What’s it even made of?” But, after asking the question out loud, I realized I had no desire to discover what was in the vegan sausage. “Actually, it’s okay. I don’t need to know.”
I assumed that, as is the case with regular meat products, the process of creating Meat™ would repulse me. Turning a full animal into a small geometric shape — a perfectly elongated cylindrical hot dog or a circular sausage patty — requires pulverizing and re-assembling flesh, which sounds totally unappetizing. Even though this wasn’t meat, I felt repulsed by the radically different shape my food would take.
It’s slightly unsettling that a vegetable (let’s say a potato) could, through some laborious process, be stripped of all qualities that help me identify it as a potato. The same goes for a cow. But I don’t find the conversion of cow to patty as distracting. The process of a cow becoming a sausage has been normalized to a point where I feel no need to question it. We even have a word for edible cow flesh: beef. Plus, I saw ground beef before I ever saw a real, whole cow, so it seemed natural that a cow should take the shape of ground flesh or a burger or a hot dog. But, I’m used to seeing full potatoes. A potato made to look like ground-beef forces me, more so than with actual beef, to imagine the process of totally bastardizing an identifiable potato to the point of total meat-looking obscurity. I do not associate vegetables with the sausage form.
After four-ish minutes, my breakfast was ready. I sat alone at a table for four and held my sandwich with both hands. Before eating, I looked at the egg and sausage, which were tucked into a whole wheat pita. I tried to determine if they were an egg and a sausage or an Egg™ and Sausage™.
The item is listed as “Impossible™ Sausage, Egg + Cheese sandwich.” So, I assumed that, due to the distributive property, the “Impossible™” applied to each food listed, not just to the sausage. I guessed that all three components were Impossible™ products, that each item consisted of a once-identifiable plant pulverized into mush and formed to look like an animal product.
I could tell the sausage patty was not meat but a middle-school-level production of meat. It was lumpy like a latke. I could spot various grains poking out. The sausage did not bleed like a once-living mammal. Instead, it was limp. There was an obvious disconnect between the appearance of this fake sausage and the idea of a meat sausage — the signifer no longer corresponded to the signified. As it turns out, this was super unappetizing.
The egg, however, looked like a real egg. To inspect it further, I squeezed the sandwich between my hands, breaking the egg white to reveal the yolk. The yolk burst out in a viscous, fondue-like drip. But the egg, now half-smashed and cracked open like a humpty-dumpty, looked too much like an egg to actually be real. The yolk was too yellow, the egg white too white. It looked a stock photo of a soft boiled egg. I decided the egg was probably fake.
Because I had already paid $8.64 for it, was fairly hungry, and planned to write this story, I took a bite. The sausage was salty, oily, and chewy. It matched the basic qualities of meat but somehow didn’t add up to the overall sensation and taste of real meat. It tasted like it had always been dead. But the egg tasted real. The yolk was cheesy and gooey and the egg white was rubbery.
As I continued to eat, taking big bites, I suddenly wondered: if I stopped eating meat because I was opposed to the idea and texture of meat, why I would want to eat fake meat? For this sausage to feel like a real sausage, to be a truly Impossibly™ convincing substitute, shouldn’t it elicit the same disgust and indulgence of actual red meat?
But the sausage didn’t taste like meat. I was enjoying it when I wasn’t inspecting the ingredients (or thinking about them). I could enjoy the different textures and tastes, the soft, warm bread and crisp fake sausage. It didn’t taste like the sandwich it looked like, but that’s why I enjoyed it. If it had tasted like fleshy, bloody beef, I would have thrown it away.
As I finished the sandwich, I looked around Clover. To my left there were large TVs with digital versions of menus. They informed me that the sandwich contained 381 calories and 23 grams of protein. I did not know the identity of the actual foods in my sandwich that a cook had smooshed into the shape of a different food. But I had the general nutritional outline of the sandwich, as if all I needed were the abstract qualities of my breakfast — the vague, crude outline of a meal.
The screens did not clarify the ingredients. So, only after finishing the meal, I looked through the Clover website on my phone to find the answer to the enduring question of my meal: was the egg real or fake? In the online description of the “Impossible™ Sausage, Egg + Cheese” sandwich, Clover explained, in bolded text, that their eggs are “local… laid days ago.” Apparently, the egg was real. I Googled a photo of the sandwich to recheck what the egg looked like, as if a picture of someone else’s pixelated version of what I just ate would somehow recover my own tangible meal. I couldn’t find a picture online.
Instead of the real egg making the fake sausage taste or feel like actual sausage, the fake sausage made the real egg seem fake. Sausage was no longer sausage but ambiguous vegetables stripped of all vegetable-identifying qualities and then congealed into an approximate image of a meat patty. It wasn’t a sausage but a post-sausage patty. The disconnect between my food and the image of my food didn’t convince me vegetables were meat but made me question the authenticity of all the food in my sandwich.
I was outraged. The Clover website did not simply inform me that the egg was real: they tried to convince me it was real by alluding to the actual, live chicken it came from. They invoked the image of a real, identifiable chicken shooting my egg out of its cloaca to legitimize the egg. So, I believed it.
Honestly, if the Clover website had listed the egg as an Impossible™ food product, I probably would have believed that, too. My sandwich could have been made of almost anything.
I left Clover and headed to class. While sitting in my 150-person lecture, my stomach started to feel bizarre. It growled, as if angry with what I had fed it. But I didn’t feel the kind of gross that meat used to make me feel. My stomach didn’t feel heavy with blood and flesh, but it also didn’t feel light, like I had merely consumed a couple vegetables.
My stomach continued to make digestion noises for the rest of the lecture. I tried to place the feeling in a mental schema of my stomach sensations. But I couldn’t identify what my stomach felt like.

“To pee or not to pee, that is the question.”
Wielding posters with pee-themed slogans, protesters marched through Harvard Yard in May 1973. At the head of the column was radical black feminist and prominent activist Florynce Kennedy, an early member of the National Organization for Women, founder of the Feminist Party, and active reproductive rights lawyer and activist.
The protesters’ destination, according to a written, first-person account penned by activist Irene Duvall, was the steps of Lowell Lecture Hall. Kennedy dubbed the action “A Protest Pee-In On The Harvard Yard.” The demonstrators, following Kennedy’s cue, lined themselves up and slowly poured glass jars full of yellow liquid down the steps.
A substantial crowd had gathered — Kennedy was a skilled promoter. Some onlookers were apparently disappointed that the women did not plan to actually urinate on the steps. The group dispersed after pouring their jars out.
The pee-in came amidst a time fraught with logistical hiccups as Harvard and Racliffe prepared to merge. According to pee-in participant Duvall, Harvard, in 1973 began allowing women to take entrance exams for admission. Applicants took exams in Lowell Lecture Hall, which at the time had no women’s restrooms. To use the bathroom mid-test, women were forced to use separate bathrooms across the street. Since they had to rush out of the building and across the street to answer nature’s call, female test-takers had up to 15 minutes less time to complete their exams than did their male counterparts. An applicant brought the situation to Kennedy’s attention, hoping her celebrity would help shed light on the issue.
Duvall writes that Kennedy and her cohort of activists were most likely in the midst of planning a protest against anti-abortion lobbyers when they heard about the bathroom story. But no injustice was too small for Kennedy, and she took on the Harvard students’ cause.
Kennedy planned the protest for May, when she and many other activists would be at a Feminist Party convention in Boston. She founded the Feminist Party in 1971 as a fleeting political party centered around feminist ideals. The pee-in was one of many official events undertaken at the Second Annual Convention of the Feminist Party. According to a Boston Phoenix article, other highlights included feminist workshops such as a discussion on “Women, Media & Watergate” and “a non-sexist rendering of Cinderella performed by children.”
Kennedy was an activist from the 1960s until her death in 2000, and the pee-in wasn’t her first moment of advocacy. Earlier in 1973, Kennedy spoke in support of the Graduate Students and Teaching Fellow Union strike. On this visit, Kennedy announced her plans to protest the “lack of women’s bathroom facilities at Harvard,” as paraphrased in a Crimson article, though the pee-in was still over two months away.
At this visit, Kennedy also said to a crowd, “If you had to give the world an enema, you would put it in Harvard Yard. This has got to be the asshole of the world.”
Kennedy often garnered media attention by being outlandish. In 1973, Kennedy told the Washington State University daily newspaper “Never hesitate to be bizarre. Marshmallow throwing is a good technique — always try to have fun.”
In fact, Kennedy traveled straight from the Harvard pee-in to the “Toilet Bowl Caravan” in the summer of 1973. Protesters rode from San Francisco to Hollywood to demonstrate against Hollywood’s representations of women. The provocative name, like the pee-in, referred in part to the need “to flush the Hollywood female role-games down the drain,” according to a 1973 Los Angeles Free Press Article.
The 1973 pee-in took place against a backdrop of turbulence in the Harvard/Radcliffe relationship: In 1972, Harvard vowed to increase the number of admitted women by 150 each year. It wasn’t until 1977 that admissions officially became “sex-blind.” In 1999, Radcliffe and Harvard merged.

Duvall recalls that, at the end of the pee-in protest, Kennedy raised a fist, yelling “Let the Dean of Harvard be warned. Unless Lowell Hall gets a room for women so that women taking exams don’t have to hold it in, run across the street or waste time deciding whether to pee or not to pee, next year we will be back doing the real thing.”

There is no record that the “real thing” ever happened.

“I’ve already gathered over 150 pounds of acorns this season alone,” says Myles C. Green, a Teaching Fellow for the Program of Negotiation at Harvard Law School and an active member of the New England Acorn Cooperative. He’s squatting under a massive oak tree in the Harvard Museum of Natural History courtyard. He picks up another acorn and examines it before dropping it into a woven basket.
It’s 10 a.m. on a crisp October morning and we’re kneeling in the grass, foraging through the fallen foliage for healthy acorns. His criteria for harvesting are fairly simple: The acorn shouldn’t be broken or obviously rotten. Nuts with their caps still attached are inedible. Large acorns are easier to process than small acorns. Acorns with small holes have been eaten from the inside by a curculio glandium, otherwise known as the acorn weevil: a tiny, long-snouted insect that lays its eggs in the nut.
A trio of passersby notices us crawling around. Intrigued, they drop to their knees a few feet away and curiously begin digging up and examining their own acorns. When Green sees this, he heads over to introduce himself. The group explains that they’re from China, and they’re visiting Boston for a conference. They’ve never seen people gathering acorns before.
He tells the curious visitors that acorns are a wild food source, and that we’re searching for edible ones. “Most people in the U.S. don’t eat acorns,” he adds quickly. He explains that humans have been eating acorns for a long time, although they now represent a highly underutilized and effortlessly renewable food source — abundant, nutrient-dense, free, and delicious (with a little processing and preparation).
Later, Green explains that this type of interaction isn’t unusual: “Often when I’m out foraging for acorns I’ll put a sign in the ground that says Acorn Foraging Workshop in Progress. It acts as an invitation for folks who are walking by.”
The tourists seem impressed, and they decide to join our group and forage with us. For a little while, we’re just six happy squirrels scrabbling acorns out of the dirt.
***
As described on its website, the Cooperative is a “young and burgeoning network of acorn enthusiasts from New England and beyond.” Daniela M. Dana co-founded it with her childhood friend following their 2015 visit to the Greek island of Kea. Under the tutelage of acorn expert Marcie Mayer, they learned
how to process and store the nuts.
Back in the United States, they decided to found the New England Acorn Cooperative (NEAC) as “a project to rekindle people’s affiliation to this nearly universal ancestral bread basket, keystone species, and exploration of the innumerable connections to personal and societal health.” Dana explains that balanophagy — the practice of eating acorns — has figured into the diets of numerous societies throughout history. The nut, when processed, has a high nutritional value and can be utilized in numerous ways, including as a flour in baked goods.
Maybe the squirrels are onto something.
***
To test this hypothesis, we venture to the Hawthorne Youth and Community Center in Roxbury: a cozy venue with colorful walls and a makeshift kitchen. This afternoon’s programming, and the reason for my visit, is a three-hour workshop sponsored by the Boston Food Forest Coalition titled “The Mighty Acorn.” Green and NEAC founder Dana lead the workshop, eager to share their acorn expertise with over a dozen attendees who are equally eager to learn the art and craft of processing, baking, and consuming the famous fruit of the oak.
We sit on the floor, forming a circle in the center of the room, and introduce ourselves. The group is a patchwork of different characters and backgrounds, ranging from a father-son duo to a few inquisitive permaculture students, all brought together for this one afternoon through a shared curiosity about the acorn. The majority have never tried an acorn before, and some were unaware they were even edible for non-squirrels in the first place — although the label “edible” might be a tad optimistic.
As we set out to process the hundreds of nuts brought in for the day, we learn that acorns contain a substantial amount of tannins, which are naturally occurring compounds characterized by a bitter, astringent taste. Tannins are toxic in large quantities — making acorns a less-than-ideal snack. The tannins can be removed, however, revealing the mild and earthy flavor of the acorn.
To discern which acorns are suitable for eating, we begin with the float test. We dump acorns into a pail of water, and those that float (indicating infestation or decay) are returned to the woods. Next, each acorn is cracked, and those with healthy insides are added to the final batch. Once the “meat” of the acorns is fully separated and sorted, it’s blended down into finely ground pieces. Then, the long process of leaching begins. The acorns are mixed with water (to be changed at least once a day), and the tannins slowly leach out of the acorn, rendering it edible and delicious. This takes at least a week.
Luckily, for the workshop, we had some pre-prepared. The acorns themselves, after being leached, taste vaguely like walnuts. Incorporated into recipes, however, the flavor really shines. The acorn pudding tastes like a sweet mix between oatmeal and tapioca. Acorn coffee, though lacking caffeine, was surprising in its sweetness. Acorn bread formed a delicious gluten-free alternative to traditional bread. It can be easily flavored by mixing in berries and nuts.
The Cooperative isn’t just a culinary hobbyist group — for Dana, the vision is far broader than that.
First and foremost, it’s a space for community. Dana hopes to “begin all interactions with really introducing this group of people who have heard about the co-op from a variety of sources.” She aims to foster an environment for people to identify and learn “a bit about each other as well as what they thought they came to learn, and the conversations that come out of these meetings and workshops are deliberately what we’re about.”
Beyond that, though, the co-op exists in a far greater context and history, especially surrounding permaculture, conservation, and mindful consumption. The NEAC website describes its lofty task: to “draw students and experts of the science, arts, and economics of public and private land stewardship, governance, farming, food production, building, medicine, and nutrition together to better understand the value and benefits of human efforts and labor in all.”

If all you saw of John D. O’Bryant School of Mathematics and Science was its back-to-school community potluck this September, you might think it was just like any other public high school.
At the front of the cafeteria, a parent council member stands to give a short speech welcoming attendees and gestures toward tables stacked with raffle tickets and desserts. After the announcement ends, conversation resumes. Parents raise their voices to make themselves heard over the complete discography of Michael Jackson pulsing from a large speaker.
But beneath the unremarkable surface hums a quiet intensity: The race to secure a seat at O’Bryant, one of Boston’s three public “exam high schools,” begins as early as the third grade. Boston, like several other urban public school districts in the country, boasts an elevated tier of highly coveted test-in high schools that many parents see as a direct path to a place like Harvard.
Parents jostle to get their children into advanced programming, shell out large sums of money for tutoring, and lottery for temporary placement in charter schools — all for a shot at sending their kid to an exam school and, later, a big-name university.
For many in Boston, middle school choice is all about high school acceptance. High school acceptance is all about college admissions.
At O’Bryant, flyers plastered across the cafeteria walls encourage students to visit their college counselors. “HAVE YOU MET US?” one asks in large print. “Come Say Wassup. College is coming. Let’s make it easier.”
“We always knew that we wanted our kids to go for higher education, and there was a particular push towards that at the exam schools,” says Derrick A. Samuels, parent to two exam school students. He sits at a lacquered cafeteria table and braces his elbows against the blue-and-white tablecloth. O’Bryant’s focus on higher education meant “the school would tell us what [our kids] had to do in order to be in a position to apply for college,” he says. “That’s not something we would have had in a public school setting.”

 “Well, a public, non-exam-school setting,” interjects Rebekah E. Samuels, Derrick’s wife. The exchange reveals a truth well established among Boston parents: while the city of Boston is home to dozens of different public schools, O’Bryant, Boston Latin Academy (BLA), and Boston Latin School (BLS) rank in a league of their own.
The race to enter that league has clear winners and losers.
Black and Hispanic children make up nearly 75 percent of Boston’s student-age population — but represent just 40 percent of the students enrolled in the exam schools. And at BLS, the largest and most selective of the top-tier trio, black and Hispanic students comprise 20 percent of enrollees.
Boston is a diverse city with a fraught racial past, and its public school system reflects this ongoing tension. The exam schools, on the other hand, have remained largely untouched. Those lucky enough to take a seat in exam school classrooms can count on a rigorous high school education and, later, maybe even a degree from a prestigious university — along with all the career security that affords.
Ever since a controversial lawsuit challenging Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies went to trial in Boston last month, reporters, lawyers, and spectators across the nation have begun scrutinizing how prospective students win spots at American colleges and universities and the role that race and class play in that process. Currently, Harvard takes what it calls a “holistic” approach to admissions, meaning admissions officers weigh metrics including a candidates’ test scores, personal qualities, and racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
The Boston exam school system pursues a very different tactic. Exam schools evaluate only supposedly “objective” criteria, taking into consideration students’ GPAs and their scores on a test called the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). Lawyers for Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action advocacy group that sued Harvard in Nov. 2014, have repeatedly argued in court that this method of admissions is fairer and should replace a race-conscious process.
But, at Harvard and at Boston public schools, these so-called “objective” metrics may not deserve the name. The game of who gets in where is undergirded — and, to a certain extent, predetermined — by a complex ecosystem of devoted parents, well-paid tutors, and driven students.
“In Boston, you really have to advocate for your kids, be educated, know what’s going on, and ask questions,” Rebekah says. “Otherwise things just happen, and unless you catch them…” She lapses into silence.
“If your kid misses the lottery for the charter schools, that's an option that you don't have. If your kid misses the ISEE, if you don't sign them up for it, they don't take the exam.”
Cameron B. Jones ’20 still remembers his first day at Curley K-8 School. The cafeteria thrummed with first-day-of-school energy. “Troy!” an excited fourth grader exclaimed, tapping Jones on his shoulder. Jones turned quickly and took in an unfamiliar face. “Oh, you’re not Troy,” the fourth grader realized, disappointed.
His mistake was understandable: Jones, “Troy,” and the unnamed fourth grader were among the few white students at Curley, a predominantly black and Hispanic public school in Jamaica Plain.

 
Jones had just met one of his classmates in the Advanced Work Class, or AWC, a long-standing Boston Public Schools program that delivers an accelerated curriculum to students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades.
Whether or not you’re invited to join the AWC program depends on how you score on a single test administered in the fall of the third grade: the Terra Nova.
It’s treated like any other test day. Teachers’ instructions to their students are clear: get a good night’s rest beforehand and be sure to eat breakfast the morning of. Less clear is the role AWC plays in preparing students to compete for slots at the exam schools, which accept students as seventh graders.
“They told us that most of the kids do AWC in order to go to the exam schools,” says Derrick Samuels, the parent from O’Bryant, referring to school administrators at Ohrenberger School. “And they did help with that — that was a big part of the program.”
For Candice M. Belanoff, another parent from O’Bryant, AWC seemed like “a program for kids who want to work harder and more.” She did not think it was necessary for her then-third grader to “put his nose to the grindstone and crank every night on homework.” She says, laughing, that “that just wasn't the type of life or childhood we really wanted for him.”
Belanoff wasn’t wrong — the program is challenging. Jones says the sizable reading assignments sometimes forced him to stay up well into the early morning. He was in the fourth grade at the time.
To prove they deserve the advanced track and the separate classroom, AWC students must retest each year and maintain top grades. Then, in the sixth grade, they can choose to take the ISEE for a chance to win a slot at an exam school.
When one of Billie Jo Weiss’s daughters got waitlisted for the AWC program, Weiss started worrying. “I wasn't sure how it was going to impact my child trying to get into an exam school,” she recalls. “Was she going to be prepared? Was she going to be ready?”
Her concern is hardly unmerited: on the exam, the extra hours of homework AWC demands of enrollees seem to pay off. “By the time they finish sixth grade, [AWC students] are really operating at an end of seventh grade level,” Belanoff says. “When they take the ISEE, they are leagues ahead of the rest of the pack who haven’t had the experience.”
Shena C. Lambright, a parent at O’Bryant, agrees. For her, the journey does not end at the ISEE. “[AWC] is a strong pathway to getting into an exam school,” she says. “Then if you're in an exam school and you do well, into a college of choice.”
In 2015, the Boston Public School system announced it would offer the rigor of the AWC curriculum to all students via a program titled “Excellence for All” and forged in response to parent complaints about the kind of segregation Jones witnessed. Whether or not the initiative has been effective so far is unclear.
Because AWC has its own classroom and programming, Jones and his peers spent most of their time together, cordoned off from the rest of the school. “The Advanced Work Class had all the white kids in the school,” he recalls. “It was an interesting thing to notice in the cafeteria, just sort of looking around — I don’t remember interacting with the other kids.” Apart from lunch and physical education classes, the AWC students rarely mixed with the others at Curley, he says.
Jones and his AWC classmates had scored spots on the fast track leading to the exam school system. As Jones slowly realized, very few of his black and Hispanic peers had done the same.
Once he completed the AWC program at Curley, Jones tested into BLS. Soon after graduating BLS, he matriculated at Harvard.
One of the first things Carlos I. Henriquez noticed was the sheer number of cars jamming the narrow West Roxbury street. He was driving to drop his daughter off at ISEE tutoring — one way to set her on the path to an exam school. He remembers seeing a stream of parents enter the building. He was surprised. He had assumed he was “ahead of the ballgame,” he says.
For nearly as long as there have been admissions tests, there have been companies that promise to boost the scores of hopeful applicants. America’s oldest standardized test, the SAT, was created in 1926. Roughly a decade later, a tutoring business emerged to meet demand.
And there is definite demand for ISEE tutoring. According to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School, the version of the ISEE used by the Boston Public Schools tests knowledge typically not taught before the start of the sixth grade. That means the highest scores on the test — the kind required to get into an exam school — can be achieved only by those able to pay for private, extra lessons.
The firm Henriquez chose, which he says is called “Pat Bench Tutoring,” is ISEE- and exam school-focused and has a “vetting process” for students, he says.
Companies like Bench’s, Henriquez says, want to boost their exam school admit rate — which, in turn, grows their business. So they prefer students likely to see success in the admissions process over those likely to be left behind. This means that, in the exam school admissions game, even the process of finding a tutor can be both competitive and expensive.
Henriquez and his daughter were almost turned away.
Given that ISEE scores and grades hold equal weight in the exam school admissions process, Henriquez’s child’s second honor roll status — alongside her B+ in English and A- in Math — counted as a liability.
An employee at Bench “flat out told me, she said, 'Carlos, it's going to be pretty risky,’” Henriquez remembers. (Bench could not be reached for comment.)
Weiss, a co-chair of the Student Parent Council at O’Bryant, also went to Bench for her daughter’s ISEE tutoring. She says it cost her around $1,000. That’s actually on the lower end: costs for ISEE tutoring programs can reach beyond $4,000. The alternative is a free preparatory course offered by the Boston Public Schools that has a limited number of seats.
Henriquez says he heard about Bench from a friend of a friend in Newton, an affluent suburb of Boston. There is little to no information online about the firm, except for brief mentions on parent blogs and forums. These sites are typically run by parents whose children already attend exam schools.
Mothers and fathers who know where to look flock together on these forums to seek reassurance and advice. Much of the online chatter revolves around testing.
Parents post on popular websites like College Confidential asking for the exact criteria the Boston Public School system uses to calculate the score for admission to BLS. Many of them keep their children’s ISEE scores and Math and English grades close at hand as they surf the Internet hoping to gain a realistic sense of their children’s chances.
Anxious Boston mothers and fathers want to know: How good is good enough?
For Henriquez, BLS is “the ultimate prize.” “I've been planning this, wanting this, for my daughter since she was born,” he confesses.
At BLS, Harvard isn’t a pipe dream. It’s a school just across the Charles, well within reach.
“There’s a huge culture at BLS of trying to get into Harvard,” says Daniel E. Sherman ’20, a BLS alumnus. He remembers that a significant number of his classmates applied. “If you're in very good academic standing at BLS, then everybody just assumes you're applying to Harvard,” he adds.

 The perceived connection between BLS and Harvard is very real. A 2013 Crimson report found that one in every 20 freshmen hails from just seven high schools — and BLS is one of them. That year, the school sent 15 students to Harvard.
BLS, then, is a stepping stone for parents like Henriquez who have their eyes set on the College. When he thinks about BLS, he thinks about Harvard. His tone shifts, insistent, as he recounts the questions constantly on his mind: “‘How many kids are going to Harvard this year?’ In all honesty, I want my daughter to be like you; I want her to go to Harvard.”
But BLS is not without problems. For years, the high school has struggled to accept a diverse student body, in part due to its race-blind admissions practices. Following court-ordered busing in 1974, exam schools including BLS implemented a quota system that mandated accepting black and Hispanic students at a rate of 35 percent. That lasted until the mid-90s, when the parents of two white students rejected by the school filed separate lawsuits within a few years of one another. The two trials forced the schools to stop considering race in their admissions processes.
Enrollment of black and Hispanic students has fallen sharply ever since.

 “I was probably the only black person in my AP Physics class and my AP Chem class,” recalls Kaya R. Bos ’20, another BLS alumna. “All the black kids stuck together for the most part — there weren’t that many black kids in general.”
This lack of diversity is not unique to BLS: Derrick Samuels has also noticed a similar disparity at BLA, where his daughter is enrolled.
“This city is filled with minorities,” Derrick says after a pause. “But the three schools…” His voice trails off as he glances upwards, absorbed in thought. We’re sitting in the Samuels’ living room, a cozy and mostly silent space punctuated by the occasional shriek from upstairs, often followed by raucous laughter. Derrick explains that the kids are probably playing Fortnite.
The Samuels have two children: a son midway through a ninth grade at O’Bryant and a daughter in seventh grade at BLA. Directly behind the couch on which Derrick and Rebekah are seated stands a bookshelf adorned with family photos. The Samuels’ son smiles in a baseball uniform; their daughter poses with ballet shoes; the four of them yell on a rollercoaster, eyes wide and arms stretching upwards.

 “When I went to BLA to register our daughter for soccer, I noticed it,” Derrick says. “It doesn’t even look like the city when I go into that school.”
BLA is only a few minutes’ walk from the Samuels’ home in Roxbury, a neighborhood in which 94 percent of residents identify as non-white.
Hey! We’re looking for students at Harvard who came through the Boston Public School system, but didn’t go to one of the three exam schools — any chance you know anyone?
Three weeks passed, and the answer to every email, text, and DM we sent was a resounding “No.” Then we received a single link to a single article featuring a single student: Johnny Y. Fang ’20, the first student from his public high school in Chinatown to ever attend Harvard.
Fang’s life story stands apart from the Boston exam school saga. From kindergarten through his senior year of high school, he attended Josiah Quincy School. He did not qualify for the AWC program in third grade, and, though he took the ISEE as a sixth grader, he was not admitted to an exam school.
Fang can name only one other peer currently at Harvard who also came from a non-exam public school in Boston.
Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73 wrote in an email that, in recent years, the College has accepted between 22 and 30 students from Boston public schools each year. She wrote that “those schools have long been a great source of terrific students for us and we value our good relationships with them.”
Asked how many Harvard students hail from exam schools versus non-exam schools, McGrath wrote that it goes against College policy to “provide numbers by school” for privacy reasons. “But I can confirm that we do get very very strong students from non-exam schools, though in smaller numbers,” she clarifies.
Fang said his years at Quincy offered a close-up view of the way exam schools reshape the demographic composition of the city’s other public schools.
“In elementary school, you’d get kids from all different backgrounds — it was just normal,” he recalls. But things changed as students began to test into AWC and the exam schools.
“In fourth grade, they’d get into the AWC program, and pretty much everyone from AWC would get into the exam schools — so quality students would go to BLS, BLA, and the O’Bryant,” Fang says. “The Quincy became mostly just Asian and African-American once you got to the upper school.
“They all seemed to have a lot more work than me,” Fang remembers of his friends at exam schools. “There seemed to be a certain level of rigor that they were getting and I wasn’t.”
One of his friends used to jokingly refer to him as “the uncultured swine,” in part because he had never read any Shakespeare.
“To this day, I still haven’t read Shakespeare,” Fang says. “I wanted to be an English major at Harvard, but I just didn’t have the preparation.”
Instead, Fang chose Anthropology and the Comparative Study of Religion. “Going to high school in the disadvantaged area where I grew up, with a low-income background, with an immigrant background, I thought a lot about the stresses that people lived,” he says, leaning back against the hardwood paneling of the Kirkland House Junior Common Room. “I was trying to acclimate to the culture at Harvard and be a part of the community without losing myself.”
Outside, heavy sheets of rain whip the room’s towering windows. Imposing portraits of powerful, 18th-century white men ring the space, the subjects’ pallid cheeks illuminated by the light of a chandelier.
Fang might have felt less culture shock had he attended BLS, founded one year before Harvard in 1635. Portraits of former headmasters — equally imposing and equally pallid — hang in that school’s auditorium. Inscribed around the building are the names of famous and infamous white alumni: Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Hancock, Charles Sumner.
Often, the students sitting in the BLS auditorium look like the men staring down from the walls.
Belanoff, who is white and has a child at O’Bryant, says she knows what it looks like when students of color are left behind. Originally, her son’s class at the public Hurley K-8 School was around half white and half Hispanic. Other historically marginalized racial groups were also represented. But, by the end of sixth grade, only one white child remained. Some left for the exam schools. Others left for charter schools and private alternatives.
“The kids who are left out of that system really notice it,” Belanoff says. “They wonder, ‘What’s wrong with me and what’s wrong with all these kids who look like me?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School published a full collection of United States court cases dating from 1658 to 2018 on Monday as part of a years-long project to make case law more accessible.
The initiative, dubbed the Caselaw Access Project, digitized more than 40 million pages of U.S. state, federal, and territorial case law documents from the Law School library. Though basic information for all cases in the database is now publicly accessible, users are limited to five hundred full case texts per day. Harvard affiliates currently have unlimited access to all case texts.
Adam Ziegler, who directed the project, said his team worked on the Caselaw Access Project for more than six years.
“It started with the simple observation that there was a real need for ready access to court opinions,” Ziegler said.
The project was funded partly through a partnership with Ravel, a legal research and analytics startup founded by two Stanford Law School students. Ravel earned “some commercial rights” through March 2024 to charge for greater access to files, according to Ziegler. The company, however, has not publicly stated whether they plan to do so.
Representatives from Ravel did not respond to requests for comment.
Several Law School faculty members expressed their optimism about the project and its potential. Law School Professor I. Glenn Cohen called the project “a game changer,” and Law School Professor Christopher T. Bavitz said the initiative will bring about “enormous benefits” for teaching, research, and legal analysis.
“Case law is the product of public resources poured into our court system,” Cohen wrote in an email. “It’s great that the public will now have better access to it.”
The Caselaw Access Project will greatly reduce the cost of accessing historical court cases, according to Bavitz.
“If we want to ensure that people have access to justice, that means that we have to ensure that they have access to cases,” Bavitz said. “The text of cases is the law.”
Apart from cost, the new digital repository also makes it easier for programmers to efficiently access large sets of raw court case data. Researchers can now access text files that enable them to conduct large-scale computer processing, Ziegler said. He expects to see the public use the database to understand how courts influence one another and reveal disagreements between courts.
“The best lawyer can’t even read one percent [of all court cases in U.S. History],” Ziegler added. “But a computer can, and can do it efficiently.”
Legal experts, like Bavitz, are hopeful about future developments that can grow out of the Caselaw Access Project.
“It really invites others to come along and build new tools on top of that,” Bavitz added. “I think we're all excited to see what tools people build to tap into this stuff.”

Houghton Library hosted a Halloween reading of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein” in honor of the 200th anniversary of the book’s publication, attracting scholars, students, and members of the public alike.
The event marked the first time the Houghton Library has held a marathon reading, according to lead organizer and Houghton curator Leslie A. Morris. The reading was part of Frankenweek, a week-long celebration at Harvard that featured a symposium on the significance of “Frankenstein” and screenings of eleven different film adaptations of the book.
“It is one of those novels that really has permeated culture in a way. Considering that it was Mary Shelley’s first book, it’s quite remarkable,” Morris said.
Participants could sign up to read aloud a 10-minute section of “Frankenstein,” and a steady stream of people flowed in and out of the room throughout the event, grabbing treats from the back while listening to sections of the novel. Time slots to read were filled within 36 hours of the sign-up form’s posting, Morris said.
The reading was affiliated with Frankenreads, an international celebration organized by the Keats-Shelley Association of America. People from 46 countries around the world participated in similar marathon readings of “Frankenstein.”
Members of the class English 148: “Modern Monsters in Literature and Film” participated in the event because they had studied “Frankenstein” as part of the course.
“I was a little nervous when I started, but once you get into the flow of things, it’s so easy to read it because you can feel the emotion of the words,” said Aislinn S. Devlin ’21, a student in the class.
Several participants said they found the event rewarding.
“I like reading aloud,” said reader Hannah M. McCormack ’18. “I think it’s a really fun dynamic that gets added to reading. When I was little, my dad used to read to us aloud for an embarrassingly long time — it was the best way to hear a story.”
English Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, who also read at the event, said he found the experience of hearing the novel “intellectually illuminating” and emphasized the book’s significance over the past two centuries.
“It’s not a small achievement to create a modern myth that anticipated our current anxieties about artificial intelligence, about science fiction creatures, about the human capacity to create life and the possible consequences of creating life,” Greenblatt said. “I mean, she did this miraculously really far anticipation of the actual means that we’ve now developed to do some of the things she was dreaming about.”
Allison Pingree, director of cross-school programming at the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching, said she initially planned to leave after reading her section of the text but decided to stay.
“I think it was about the combination of the celebration, the text, and the community that brought me here, and it’s been wonderful to hear,” she said. “It’s an important moment to reflect on how language intersects with how we relate with each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hordes of people, decked out in Red Sox gear and chanting “Yankees suck!” in unison, poured out of the Park Street T Station and onto the streets Wednesday morning to celebrate the Boston Red Sox’s ninth World Series win.
With a final score of five to one, the Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday night to become the 2018 World Series champions.
Thousands gathered downtown Wednesday morning for the team’s victory parade, which began at 11:00 a.m. at Fenway Park and ended near Boston’s City Hall. The jubilant crowd included Boston locals and Harvard students alike. With confetti floating above their heads, Bostonians cheered as Red Sox players, officials, coaches and their families rode on duck boats down the streets.
Ethan R. McCollister ’20 attended the parade and described its atmosphere as “electric.”
“It was amazing to see the players and seeing that they were all super riled up,” McCollister said. “They’ve been in pro-mode for the whole season and now they can let loose a little bit and it was pretty funny.”
McCollister, a lifelong fan of the Red Sox, was in the Winthrop House common area watching Game Five, the final game of the series, when the Red Sox triumphed on Sunday. Along with some friends, McCollister took the subway to the Boston Commons that night to celebrate.
Boston resident and Red Sox fan of 64 years, Peter F. Kasarjian, was also in attendance at the parade. Kasarjian watched the final game of the Series in his living room with his wife and said that they “kind of expected” the Red Sox’s victory.
Kasarjian, who is a retired Plymouth school teacher, had not until recently been able to partake in Boston sports celebrations due to his work. Moreover, Kasarjian said that for most of his life, there had not been much to celebrate.
“The Red Sox were the worst team in baseball. The Patriots were the worst team in football for a long time, and 2000 hit and everything changed,” Kasarjian said. “So this is good.”
Not all Harvard students, however, were as excited by the team’s victory. Zachary R. Werner ’22, who hails from New Jersey, called the Red Sox franchise “ridiculously pathetic.”
“The Red Sox this year, they were a good team, I’m not denying that,” Werner said. “But I will say though, them singing ‘New York, New York’ in the locker room after they won, it shows that no matter how successful they’ll be, they’ll never stop thinking about the Yankees.”
Werner passed on watching the final game of the World Series Sunday and also opted out of celebratory activities with his friends afterwards.
“As soon as the Yankees got eliminated, I knew it would be best for me to focus on my studies,” Werner said. “My friends were asking me if I wanted to go to Boston to celebrate the game with all the people. I could never ever stoop to that level, of selling my soul to the Boston Red Sox.”
Enthusiasm for Boston’s native team, however, was clear during Wednesday’s parade. Looking on as the Boston crowds tossed a football across the streets, chanting and waving posters, Pam J. Szkutak, Kasarjian’s sister-in-law, described the pure “elation” of the event.
For Szkutak, this year’s World Series win and the following celebration represent more than just a game.
“When they say ‘Boston Strong,’ this is what you’re talking about,” Szkutak said. “We’re strong for bad things, we’re strong when we celebrate good things. That’s what Boston is made of.”

A group of undergraduates headed downtown to the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse Monday morning to watch and support eight current and former students as they testified in support of affirmative action on the eleventh day of the ongoing Harvard admissions trial. Members of The Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies led the outing.
Crimson photographers tagged along with the travelers, heading out from the Harvard T stop at 8 a.m. Relive the trip — and the emotional testimony — below.
Members of Harvard TAPAS gathered to wait together for the Red Line on their way support their peers testifying in court. The group previously put out a call urging everyone to wear shirts reading “Diversitas" — a play on Harvard's motto of "Veritas."
The students boarded the busy subway with a mission. "I would really hate for affirmative action to be eliminated," Daniel Lu '20 (right), who organized the trip, said in an interview. "So I think it's really important for us to support our peers that are testifying and putting themselves out there."
As students clambered onto the Silver Line at South Station, some said they do not buy the arguments advanced by Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action advocacy group that sued Harvard in 2014 over its admissions policies. SFFA is alleging in court that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants — charges Harvard has repeatedly denid.
"I do recognize that there could be discrimination," said James Z. Gui '20, one of the students on the trip. "However, I think that the rhetoric of other minorities taking Asians’ spots is very toxic, and I really think that we should be defending affirmative action."
Rain began to pour as students made the trek from the T station to the courthouse — located in the Seaport District of Boston. They arrived just after 8:30 a.m.
The group of students briefly stopped to talk and take pictures in front of the courthouse. Many stayed there for most of the day, sticking around to witness every minute of the eight current and former students' impassioned testimony urging the benefits of affirmative action and the need for a diverse student body. The witnesses often drew on personal experiences — including racially charged childhood bullying, fears of Harvard's whiteness, and solace found in College affinity groups — to make their case. The Crimson spoke to several of those who testified as they left the courthouse.
Madison A. Trice ’21 said one of the highlights of her experience testifying was seeing the extensive student support at the court trial. She added it was important to her to be able to speak about how she personally benefited from Harvard’s race-conscious admissions system.
Thang Q. Diep’19 said the conclusion of his testimony felt like a great burden lifting off his shoulders. He said he felt stressed in the days leading up to Monday because he did not want to forget anything vital.
Sally Chen ’19 (left) laughed outside of the courthouse shortly after testifying. Earlier in the day, Chen said she was "stressed to tears,” mainly because she felt uncertain how the media would report her words. She said that, overall, her participation in the trial made her see why it is important to care about this issue, and that she is glad she took the witness stand.
Asked why she decided to get involved with the admissions trial, Catherine H. Ho ’21 said she wanted to highlight the different experiences Asian Americans see at Harvard. She said she believes diversity — especially racial diversity — is key to fostering learning on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new Boston-area mental health initiative focused on Asian-American women enrolled its first cohort at Harvard this fall.
The program, called “Asian Women’s Action for Resilience and Empowerment,” launched in September and consists of part group therapy session, part research study. It aims to fulfill a need for mental health care for an under-researched demographic, according to Boston University professor Dr. Hyeouk “Chris” Hahm, who created the program.
Hahm said she first conceived of plans for AWARE while working as a clinical social worker in New York City 19 years ago. She noticed patterns of conflict within immigrant families — especially those from Asia — and in particular among Asian-American women.
But Hahm said she found little existing research on this demographic.
“I realized that there were so few studies, so few articles, on these immigrant — particularly Asian-American immigrant — children, as well as their parents,” she said. “In particular, there was so little research done targeting Asian-American women — especially their sexual risk behaviors, depression, and suicidality.”
Citing the “model minority myth” — the idea that Asian Americans can succeed in the United States regardless of their background — Hahm said people tend to generalize Asian Americans’ experiences and that as a result Asian-American women may feel that their concerns are misunderstood.
“They put them all in one category: if you’re Asian, then you’re great at math, you’re well-off, you’re ambitious, you do well. You don’t have problems,” she said. “In the meantime, our children, our young people, are still suffering.”
Hahm said Asian Americans experience stress from conflicting identities, and — in the cases of many children from immigrant families — the weight of growing up in a “high pressure, high stress, high ambition, but low support” environment. She added that Asian Americans are less likely to seek mental health treatment than members of other racial groups.
Asian Americans were the demographic least likely to seek mental health treatment, according to a University of Michigan and Boston University-based study that surveyed over 43,000 United States undergraduate and graduate students from 2012 to 2015.
Hahm first launched AWARE at Wellesley College in 2017, and later extended the program to Boston University.
Jenny H. Hsi, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health who helped implement the program at Harvard, said AWARE is helpful because it gives participants a space to discuss important issues with people of similar backgrounds.
“Part of the reason why we are offering this as a group experience, and not as an individual experience, is also because getting people who may have similar or resonant experiences together in a room often helps validate people’s experiences and difficulties,” Hsi said.
Harvard University Health Services is "piloting" the program, and Hsi said the therapists who administer the group sessions at Harvard are of East Asian backgrounds themselves.
The group sessions are focused on topics such as parenting styles and disempowerment, body image and discrimination, and sex and substance abuse.
Hahm and Hsi both said previous participants identified the sessions about parental relationships as the most helpful.
“What we do want to get across is that parents who come from various Asian cultures who may not have had the same experiences as their children growing up here, they’re operating from a different context,” Hsi said. “The goal is to help the two sides understand each other better.”
Correction: Nov. 2, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Dr. Hyeouk “Chris” Hahm came up with the idea for AWARE while working as a clinical social worker in New York City nine years ago. In fact, Hahm came up with the idea 19 years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, Harvard Management Company, the firm that oversees the University's multi-billion dollar endowment, is a black box. On its number of employees, HMC is characteristically silent.
N.P. “Narv” Narvekar, who took over as HMC’s CEO in Dec. 2016, wrote in a Jan. 2017 letter to Harvard affiliates that he would halve HMC’s 230-person staff by the end of calendar year 2017.
Since the letter, Narvekar has not commented publicly on the size of the company’s staff. The CEO released a message on the status of Harvard’s endowment in last week’s University Financial Report — and the report did not provide a new employee figure. HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment last week on the number of people HMC employees.
The planned reduction in staff was part of Narvekar’s shift from HMC’s previously large in-house operation toward external management. As part of this transition, HMC spun off several internal investment teams. In 2017, Bloomberg reported that Harvard would invest at least $300 million in a hedge fund formed by former HMC managers, and in February of this year, HMC’s 22-person real estate team joined private equity firm Bain Capital.
In last week’s financial report, Narvekar wrote that the natural resources team is the only in-house investment team that remains. Harvard’s investments are now primarily overseen by a “Generalist Team,” a new group of employees who “take ownership of the entire portfolio, regardless of asset class,” according to job posting on HMC’s website. The team is part of the endowment’s shift to a ‘generalist’ model in which asset managers focus on the entire portfolio, not just a specific asset class.
“The HMC Generalist Team was officially formed just prior to the start of fiscal year 2018 and has, therefore, been functioning for over a year. While some team members have been trained as generalists, others bring deep specialist experience,” Narvekar wrote in the financial report.
The company’s website only lists HMC's top three administrators — Narvekar, Chief Investment Officer Rick Slocum, and Chief Operating Officer Bob Ettl — under the heading “Leadership.” Harvard’s peers, though, take a markedly different approach; all of the other Ivy League endowment offices list their staff members on their websites.
LinkedIn estimates the size of HMC as between 201 and 500 employees, a range determined by the administrator of HMC’s LinkedIn page. It is unclear when the page was last updated.
With little information about the people involved in stewarding Harvard’s $39.2 billion endowment, experts are left to speculate about the extent of Narvekar’s personnel changes.
Charles A. Skorina, the head of a finance executive search firm, put the number of employees at “around 120.”
“The last time I heard it was around 120. That was at least nine months ago,” Skorina said.
In his first letter to Harvard affiliates, Narvekar wrote that HMC’s shift towards external managers is partly due to competition for talent.
“In recent years… the tremendous flow of capital to external managers has created a great deal of competition for both talent and ideas, therefore making it more difficult to attract and retain the necessary investment expertise,” Narvekar wrote.
The shift also came after criticism Harvard faced for the large compensation packages of its internal investment managers, which sometimes reached tens of millions of dollars.
After Narvekar’s overhaul, some former HMC employees continue to manage Harvard’s money — now, from outside of the University.
According to David L. Yermack '85, chair of the Finance Department at New York University Stern and a former managing editor of The Crimson, there could be ambiguity over who counts as HMC staff, which may be one reason why Narvekar has remained mum about the number of people he employs. Yermack also said there is no law that requires companies to disclose this number.
“HMC probably doesn't disclose the information because there is no such requirement. In addition, there are probably numerous subcontractors and consultants who are in a grey area somewhere between in-house and external,” he wrote.
Skorina speculated that HMC’s opacity may stem from another cause: a concern about the press attention the Harvard name inevitably garners.
“In the case of Harvard, every time you report a staff change there is press, there is media speculation,” he said. “The idle speculation could do more damage than just not saying anything.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Halloween-themed Annenberg and an evening of candy and music in the Yard marked an atypical Wednesday at Harvard, as undergraduates paused to celebrate the holiday.
Costumed students strolled around Harvard Yard at a trick-or-treat event hosted by the College Events Board, which featured celebration a photo tent, costume competition, and plenty of candy.
Avril Saavedra ’21 and Jennifer Y. Wang ’22 dressed up as “Necromorphs” — characters Saavedra described as “reanimated corpses from alien bacteria” from the video game franchise "Dead Space." Saavedra said it took five hours just to build the protruding jaws of their costumes.
“About five hours to build the jaw, and then like three hours to put it all together in the morning,” she said. “All my teachers were terrified. Several of my classmates refused to sit next to me.”
“It’s been fun,” Saavedra added. “Halloween is good on a Wednesday!”
Wang said many people took photos of the duo throughout the day. John S. Martin, an ID checker in Annenberg Hall, where freshmen eat meals, even called Saavedra’s and Wang’s costumes “outrageous” earlier in the day.
Pat M. Rounds, a graduate student at the Graduate School of Education who is currently interning with CEB, handed out candy from the steps of Weld Hall to trick-or-treaters. Rounds, dressed up as Thing 1 from Dr. Seuss’s "The Cat in the Hat," said students seemed to enjoy the event.
“It’s great, everyone’s coming out and having a good time getting a sugar rush going,” he said.
Crimson Yard Resident Dean Dwight Fee, who sported a leopard print suit at the event, said he appreciated seeing students participate in Halloween festivities.
“Halloween is my favorite holiday. I loved it as a kid,” Fee said. “Now that I’m a Yard dean, I wanted to see more about how first-years in particular celebrate Halloween.”
“It’s really fun to improvise a bit and come out and see what’s going on,” he added, referring to his costume.
Outside of Wednesday night’s CEB event, many upperclassmen houses hosted Halloween festivities. Some professors, such as Michael I. Parzen, celebrated the holiday by dressing up.
Traditional Halloween decorations adorned Annenberg, where, mask-clad Martin greeted freshman walking into the dining hall. Pumpkins carved by students for a pumpkin-decorating competition lined the sides of the historic building.
The winners of the competition, announced on Friday, won $75 each in subsidies for entryway study breaks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The California Kid shouldn’t even have been in the weight room that day.
For Austin Sechrest, mornings were forged in persistence. Early alarms? Not a problem. Back-breaking workouts? No big deal. Before-school training sessions? Bring it on. As three-year captain of the Capistrano Valley High School water polo team, Sechrest was used to the pain. Thus, even when sick, he saw it necessary to make it to morning practice––he may have been too ill to lift weights with his teammates, but nowhere near sick enough to skip out on lifting their spirits. Little did Sechrest know that much more than an upset stomach would come out of that early morning lift.
“I was really sick that day, so I wasn’t even lifting – I was just sitting in the weight room with my team,” Sechrest said. “That’s when I officially found out, via a phone call from the admissions office, that I was going to get in [to Harvard]. Right after I got the call, I told one of my buddies, and then he told one of my other buddies, and the whole team found out pretty quickly. We all left the weight room and told my coach that we were going to go get burritos to celebrate. Afterwards, I dropped everyone off at school and just went home because I was still really sick.”
For Sechrest, now a junior co-captain for the Crimson, post-victory celebrations are both a welcome and frequent part of his water polo career. Whether the enthusiasm comes from getting into Harvard or tossing the ball into the net during a high-stakes game, success has never had any trouble finding the former Capistrano Valley Cougar. Most recently, Sechrest had a signature moment in the squad’s Sept. 15 match against the California Golden Bears.
“Our peak this year was definitely beating Cal, the No. 3 team in the country at the time,” Sechrest mused. “I watched the video of it afterwards, and right when we won, the entire team jumped up in the same exact celebration at the exact same time, and everyone in the pool made the same exact fist-pump.”
The underdog victory against the Golden Bears was secured with two crucial goals from Sechrest. He not only sent the match into extra time with a buzzer-beater past the goalkeeper, but scored the game-winning golden goal in the second overtime period.
“it was incredible, something that just shocked the water polo world for sure,” Sechrest said. “The Big Four, which is UCLA, USC, Cal, and Stanford, is generally considered untouchable for East Coast teams, so to pull off that win was really special.”
However, as team captain, Sechrest has found himself in an unusual spot. Because both he and his co-captain, defender Bennie Seybold, are juniors, the Harvard water polo squad is one of only two Crimson teams in history to not have at least one senior captain. Though this situation certainly comes with its obstacles, Sechrest credits much of the team’s recent success with Seybold’s position as a role model.
“Bennie’s a great guy – he’s one of my roommates and my closest friends,” Sechrest said. “He’s just one of the hardest workers I know, which is why he got elected captain in the first place. He was coming off an injury last year and wasn’t able to play, but every day we saw how hard he was working to get back. He definitely has kept that up and leads by example really well.”
The hallmark of the co-captains’ tenure has been their ability to foster camaraderie among members of the team. As captains, not only must Sechrest and Seybold promote conviviality between those who have been on the team before, but they must also ensure that new team members seamlessly mesh with the rest of the squad.
“I think we’re getting into a part of the season where we’ve all spent a lot of time together, which is great,” said Nathan Ondracek, a senior attacker on the team. “I think the freshmen are fully integrated into our system and the existing culture.”
However, Sechrest credits much of his success in creating a coalescent team to the nature of past Harvard water polo squads.
“In general, over the past couple of years, we’ve had a really strong connection between teammates; we’ve had great team camaraderie,” Sechrest said. “The team is just a fun group of guys to be a part of and we love going out there and battling together.”
Because water polo is a sport that relies on quick and efficient communication between team members, an atmosphere of trust and unity is essential to ensuring long-term success. According to Ondareck, the bonds between his teammates have been integral both in and out of the pool.
“Having this really close team has definitely helped us in games,” Ondareck said. “We’ve been able to play our best in everything from reading what’s happening in games to making passes and interpreting body language.”
Of course, fostering a close team environment has certainly not been easy for the junior captains. As third-years, they must straddle the fine line between leading the squad through games and working with their fellow seniors.
“[Being captain as a junior] can definitely be tough, as it’s been a lot of balancing leadership with dictating in a sense,” Sechrest admitted. “At first, it was tough to find a balance between the senior leadership and myself and Bennie, but I’d say that as the season’s gone on, the seniors have really stepped up and done a great job of leading me as well, and I’m really appreciative of that. We all get along well and have been able to join and lead the team together.”
Though the responsibilities of a captain involve serving as the foremost role model for his team, Sechrest and Seybold are not the only water polo players that have stepped into this position. Rather, many of the seniors on the squad have found their place as example-setters for younger team members.
“When we’re in a close game, we need leaders that lead by example and get the team fired up,” Ondareck said. “We have plenty of people doing that, including seniors, so that’s been very helpful to our success.”
However, for the Crimson, the real work is just beginning. Though the team is still focusing on the regular season games that lie ahead, its eyes are set on the upcoming NEWPC Championships.
“We started the season off really strong with a couple of signature wins, but since then, we’ve hit a lull over the past couple of weeks,” Sechrest said. “I’d say we bounced back pretty well this past weekend, and we’re definitely trending up as we’re going toward our conference championship tournament.”
For Austin Sechrest, the transition from Cougar to Crimson has been anything but easy. However, the persistence that he embodied over the course of his high school years has certainly carried over into college. Going into the postseason, Sechrest’s drive will be essential in nailing down yet another one of his celebration-worthy victories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine for a moment that you’re driving into New Hampshire’s White Mountains. Palatable fall temperatures have plummeted into the mid-30s, and to make matters worse, freezing rain is in the forecast. The rain pelts the road and smacks the windshield.
You see taillights ahead, then hazard lights. “Why are these people being this cautious?” you wonder. “The roads won’t freeze at this temperature.”
Not two minutes later, you feel your wheels slip out from underneath you. Luckily you don’t skid off the road, but you realize you could just as easily have ended up in a roadside ditch.
I use this story to open up this week’s Around the Ivies because—if you’ve been paying any attention recently—my Ivy League football picks have belonged in a ditch for a couple of weeks now. At this point, they’re realistically buried there with no true hope of escape, especially since the season is almost over.
If you choose to read on, fasten your seatbelts, throw on your flashers, and stay far, far away from that roadside ditch.
PENN AT CORNELL
According to The Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn alumnus and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has plans to open a high-speed transit tunnel in December. The tunnel will span approximately two miles and will be located near the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne, Calif.
On that note, I think Musk should consider coming back to the East Coast and opening up a transportation hub here. Sure, you can buy a train ticket to New York or plane ticket to Philadelphia, but there would be nothing quite like a 600-mph, $1 train ticket to Cornell or Dartmouth.
The Quakers won’t get to test Musk’s new system this weekend when they travel to western New York. Travel shouldn’t play much of a factor in this one, however.
Penn by 7.5
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
66-0.
No, that’s not a score coming from the women’s rugby team. Last week, Princeton delivered a smackdown on Cornell, a team that bested Harvard nearly a month ago. The Big Red fell behind, 45-0, at halftime and failed to make any progress chipping into the Tigers’ nine-touchdown and a field goal lead.
This is easily the biggest game of the season. Each team is undefeated overall and in league play, and they stand head and shoulders above the competition. Whichever squad prevails sets itself up nicely to take the conference championship.
With that said, this is also easily my biggest pick of the season. My reputation quite honestly lies in limbo. With a correct pick, I cement my legacy as one of the greatest prognosticators of Ivy League football. Of. All. Time. With a miss, however, my career goes down in flames, tarnished like the New York Yankees’ hopes of getting out of the first round against the Red Sox.
Drum roll, please.
Princeton, pick ’em
BROWN AT YALE
I think I was wrong about Brown.
My co-writer may still have hope, but I just don’t think this is the Bears’ year. At 0-4 in league play, they still have an outside shot at respectability, but after this weekend against Yale, that will likely prove unsalvageable. After picking Brown to win several games that resulted in opposing teams blowing out the Bears, I am officially DONE. I’m off the Brown bandwagon.
Yale by 9.5
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
Owing to a trip to Fenway Park to take on Yale in just over two weeks, this is Harvard’s last true home game of the season. In keeping with the tradition of a team’s last contest on its home turf, the Crimson will celebrate its seniors before the game. However, this matchup coincides with First Year Family Weekend, a fitting time for freshmen to reflect on their first few months in Cambridge as well as the years ahead.
I joined The Crimson’s Sports staff my first semester on campus and began covering the football team during my sophomore fall. As I find myself on my way out, I’ll reflect on what I have learned by taking in the last three seasons of Ivy League football.
I have learned that Columbia may be doomed for all eternity. I have learned that Brown may be in the same predicament.
I have learned that Penn is trying to hold its own in the battle for NFL supremacy. While Harvard currently boasts the most former football players that have advanced to the NFL ranks — led by a healthy dose of FitzMagic — the Quakers are gaining with the addition of the GOAT himself Justin Watson.
I have learned nothing about Princeton’s campus, as I missed out on Harvard’s trip to New Jersey in 2016 and the two teams have clashed in Boston for the past two seasons. However, I have learned that its football team is pretty decent.
I have learned never to doubt Cornell. Instilled with a contempt for Ithaca, N.Y., ever since I attended my first Sports board meeting, I have grown to appreciate the Ivy League’s arctic outpost and its team’s apparent ability to erase any Harvard lead, no matter how large or how much time is left on the clock.
Finally, I have learned that the game looks a lot different up in the press box than it does down in the concrete bleachers of Harvard Stadium. I have witnessed celebrations in both places — once favorable, as I found myself amid a roaring crowd in the Crimson’s riveting 14-13 win over Dartmouth in 2015, and once not so favorable, as Yale radio broadcasters broke the 100-decibel mark when the Bulldogs upset Harvard in 2017. Each setting has its advantages: in one, I am able to root openly for my school’s team, and in the other I get free food and get to avoid shattered panes of glass raining down on my head (looking at you, Dartmouth).
I think that covers just about everything.
Harvard by 9.5

Sex Week, one of the best weeks at Harvard, is upon us. With events like “Hit Me Baby One More Time: BDSM in the Dorm Room” and “Talk Dirty to Me: A Dirty Talk How-To,” how could this not promise to be one of the most exciting weeks of the year? And for all of the lucky first-years, there’s an added bonus – you get to bring the fam along! That’s right, with Sex Week running until November 4th and Family Weekend occurring on November 2nd and 3rd, the whole gang will be in town just in time to catch all the exciting action (and giveaways!). Since the first event on Sunday, you can't get Sex Week off your mind, but your parents' flights are rolling in this afternoon. Now’s the time to decide: do you try to find the best way to avoid your parents for the weekend? Or do you figure out how to convince them to come? Lucky for you, we’ve figured out some of the best strategies for both.
The “I Have to Study” Ditch
At this point, your parents are probably still assuming that you spend your Fridays and Saturdays studying, not on the Quad shuttle. Ride off this assumption by playing up how you have so much work and just have to spend the rest of the day in Lamont. They won’t suspect a thing when you’re instead learning about “Sexual Fetishes A-Z” tonight – as long as you make sure you don’t run into them on their tour around the yard.
The Strategically Timed Attendance
Did you “just happen” to notice that “Harvard Today and Words of Wisdom for Families” and “Like a Virgin: Exploring the Concept of Virginity” line up at almost exactly the same time? Make your job nice and easy by simply slipping out of this program (attended by the man Larry Bacow himself) and instead hopping on over to Sever 102 for a much more transformative learning experience.
The Educational Perspective
Now that you’re (apparently) a true Harvard intellectual, simply approach your parents with the educational benefit of attending these seminars. How could they resist a well-made argument about how Sexpardy is an amazing opportunity to test your knowledge in front of other students and parents? Hint: this angle will work especially well if your parents are just as into flexing as most of the students here.
The Trick Shot
If you’re really determined to get the fam to Sex Week and don’t mind a little manipulating to do so, just tell them there’s a very important lecture that they just have to go to. Sure, they’ll be a bit surprised when the “lecture” ends up being Sex Toys 101, but at that point it’ll be too late for them to ditch out. In the end, maybe they’ll even enjoy the chance to really get to know the ~true campus culture~.
Whichever technique you decide to use, be sure to take advantage of all the fun and education (and have we mentioned giveaways?) that Sex Week has to offer. And even if your parents, siblings, uncles, weird cousins, etc. don’t decide to come along, enjoy your time with them too. After all, this will probably be your first time in months actually experiencing some sort of actual adult supervision, so you might as well embrace it.
