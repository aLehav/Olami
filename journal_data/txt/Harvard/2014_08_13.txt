PARIS—Eight weeks ago, as I prepared for the voyage, I imagined my future in Paris. There, I would frequent the cafes that sheltered writers like Ernest Hemingway and Henry Miller. I would sip my coffee, pull out my notebook, channel the spirits of the artists before me, and work studiously on my novels.
As I write this, I do not sit in a cafe. I rest on a bench waiting for the metro to come and take me back to Paris from Torcy—one of the many suburbs just outside of the city. A notebook rests on my lap but my pen’s ink has long run dry. I type my thoughts on a notepad in my phone instead.
Sometimes I wonder exactly what I expected from Paris. The city of my dreams since childhood, it had always occupied some space in my heart and mind. Did I dream of hearing French music on the streets, of intellectual discussions in the cafes? Not at all. Did I idealize the city? Hardly. A city is just that—a city with all its perks and problems. So while I never considered the possibility of such things, I was not surprised to see the metro stations house the homeless or to even find the outskirts of the city an alien universe. As for the racism, that was a slap in the face, rare occurrences that always soured my good mood.
But for all the faults I discovered in the city, my love for it remained. It was not like Paris had lied to me. The national monuments were just as formidable and beautiful as I imagined. The museums and their masterpieces continued to wow even after several visits. And the grandeur—the ornate architecture, the stunning palaces, the semblance of luxury and high culture that makes Paris so attractive to its visitors—existed. Of course such stereotypes lived only in the heart of the city. Away from the tourist centers, I found various ethnicities coexisting together, metropolitan and modernist buildings, a semblance of the not-so-luxurious urban life. But that too, surprisingly, was precious in its own way. It evoked memories of what I knew before college, of something very real and personal even if sometimes ugly.
This Saturday, I leave Paris. I depart the city with a fuller perception of the culture and people that fill its streets. And while my regard for this place is not as fantastical as it once was, it is all the better for that. Fantasies are amusing to have, but in the end reality always wins.

BUENOS AIRES—“De donde sos?” What?
It was June 1, and I’d just been dropped into the center of Buenos Aires. I spoke Spanish, but I’ll admit, I didn’t speak much. All the same, this was something different.
At first, host family conversations consisted of tired eyes and vacant smiles until slowly the words started to make sense. Helpful gestures graduated to loving laughs and then to serious warnings.
You’re going out to a concert? Where? Oh, in that neighborhood? Yes, call a cab and watch your back. It did not come as a surprise that iPhones should never be shown in streets where the stoves operate with the help of matches and sometimes the elevators do not work,
All this time a clearer notion of the U.S. arose like an oasis. Security and safety, it seems, had been things I took for granted. Diversity was not, and so the difference hit me hard…
But as did my own ignorance when I learned about many Argentine atrocities of the late 20th century. Over a delicious steak dinner, classmates and I discussed how little we knew, and the limits of what we had learned. Left and right in Buenos Aires, people talk about politics. An American is more likely to know who plays quarterback for the New England Patriots than who quarterbacks the State Department (that’s John Kerry, folks).
After two months, I returned to the U.S., showing not joy or sorrow, for I felt neither. I returned a girl (who now speaks Spanish!), a student, and also an American…just as I had left. But now when someone asks me where I’m from, I will understand my answer, at least a little bit more fully.

It was a sunny fall morning in Boston, and my medical team had finished rounding on our in-patients at around 11 a.m. With only an hour to go before noon conference, we quickly circled back to our team room, where my residents flew to the few available computer workstations and began pulling up notes and calling consults.
My fellow medical student and I looked at each other awkwardly. We would have loved to help out, but with the complete dearth of computers, we didn’t have anything useful to provide. So we sat down at the conference table and quietly tried to blend into the wallpaper.
That was when our attending physician joined us with a warm and knowing smile.
“How are you liking your time on internal medicine so far?” he asked.
With that simple open-ended question, he made himself available to us for the next hour, talking to us about specific patients on our panel, going over unusual lab tests, and probing our brains to help us understand effective therapeutic management. In doing this, he was sending us an important signal: he didn’t consider himself too busy to be tutoring medical students. The reason the signal was so powerful was because the attending was none other than our country’s current nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy.
Even though he wasn’t the nominee at the time, we all knew of Murthy’s tireless involvement with the physician advocacy organization, Doctors for America. His grassroots efforts with the organization had harnessed all of his best skills in focusing the nation’s attention on the problems besetting health care delivery and legislative reform. During our time on the hospital wards, his superior communications and ease with technology and social media were fully on display. His ability to engage diverse team members, from students to nurses and pharmacy interns helped us achieve the best outcomes for our patients. He inspired intense loyalty among those who worked with him, as we were always impressed with his quiet humility and a leadership style that prioritized consensus-building over assignation of credit.
Over the course of the month, as I got to know Murthy better, I couldn’t help being frequently reminded of why I came to medicine. Training can be so tough and the student loans so large, that one can quickly grow disillusioned. My classmates and I, on the verge of picking our future specialty, would meet up for drinks and talk about which branch of the profession would offer the best flexibility, the best lifestyle, the best salary with a shameless abandon that did not reflect the values that had brought us to medical school in the first place: a desire to help others, a passionate wish for social justice and health equity, and an impulse to build strong communities.
Murthy brought me back to my roots and reminded me of those ideals. His passion for doing right by his patients was clear and genuine. I loved it when someone would bring up his or her frustration with current health care structures, because it meant launching into a conversation about one of his favorite topics: healthcare reform. Murthy had a clear understanding of the failings of our insurance and delivery systems, and through Doctors for America, was devoting every waking hour to educating the public and recruiting medical professionals to become ambassadors for the cause.
Fast-forward a few months, and while everyone in our community was ecstatic about Dr. Murthy’s nomination to the post of Surgeon General (and commencement speaker at Harvard Medical School), no one was truly surprised. Dr. Murthy had the pedigree, trained at Harvard and Yale and attending physician at the Brigham, one of the nation’s best hospitals, as well as the ardor for the job. His track record of success, not only with DFA, but also with other entrepreneurial ventures such as TrialNetworks, a technology company that uses social networking and software technology to connect patients with clinical trials, and VISIONS, a non-profit organization in the U.S. and India that uses direct education programs to teach students about HIV prevention, were proof of an intellectual who could execute well and lead large-scale organizations. Moreover, he had already had wet his feet in healthcare policy with his appointment to the president’s Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health.
Simply put, he was the perfect man for the job.
But despite commanding the support of the Harvard community, the New England Journal of Medicine, and physicians and medical organizations countrywide, Vivek Murthy has had his nomination delayed by a single special interest group. This is nothing short of an outrage.
Murthy is a gifted leader, a compassionate physician, and a thoughtful policymaker. This country needs a Surgeon General like Dr. Vivek Murthy: someone who can flawlessly interface between physicians and communities, keeping the central actor – the patient, at center of mind.

HALF MOON BAY, Calif.—In foggy California, time is a very funny thing. There’s diffused light always, so the presence or absence of shadows offers no clues. Dusk feels like morning, 10 a.m. like 4 p.m. I don’t trust that the sky will wax dark or that day will become night, but I’m not fearful either way. Here, I can believe in perpetuity.
In foggy California, the beaches are cold and the ocean colder. We pitch two- and three-person tents and trick ourselves into thinking summer won’t end. Children run around shirtless and goose-bumped. Their parents stoke fire.
Everyone can sense a particular strangeness here—my friends call the campgrounds dreamlike, a twilight zone. There’s nothing to do, we guess, but sit on the beach as the sun sets or rises. An hour passes before someone says that perhaps the sky has turned a little more charcoal.
I could melt into this moment forever. And I do for a while longer. My fingers grow numb; wet sand soaks the parts of me not covered by Tess’s scratchy Navajo print blanket. The boys laugh and the girls shriek and occasionally we all sit in silence.
In these moments of quiet, I think of Cambridge and how its clouds are more oppressive than these. They’re higher up and looming. They make heaven seem like a dark place. Once, alone, I looked out the rain-streaked window of a red line T train racing across the Charles, and I thought of nights in San Francisco when the fog is so thick it falls as drops on windshields. I almost choked up. Night never feels pitch-black in California like it did then.
For now, here at home, I like to breathe in hard so the air stings my nose; I relish everything of my timeless, foggy California. I will try to recreate this scene sometime soon when I’m riding the subway alone. The seven others will do the same, but none of us admits to this out loud.
When the sun presumably sets and I have to start using the flashlight on my iPhone, I crawl into my tent. Later, I wake. I can’t tell what time it is.
