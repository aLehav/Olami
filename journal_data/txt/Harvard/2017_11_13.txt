Earlier this year, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos managed exactly 11 words before the crowd of graduates she was addressing at historically black Bethune-Cookman University erupted in dissent. Students turned their backs to the Secretary, chanting slogans and raising fists. As if this were not embarrassing enough, DeVos suffered the further indignity of supplicating, “Let’s choose hear to each other out,” as the jeers gained momentum. Bethune President Edison Jackson threatened to cancel graduation on the spot, and while this did not stop the protests, it slowed them enough for DeVos to crawl through the remainder of her address. After the incident, Fox News pundit Kimberly Guilfoyle accused American colleges of being “institutions of ignorance.”
This is no surprise, since the state of free expression in higher education is often described in extreme terms. Words like “crisis,” “threat,” and “deathbed” are routinely used to describe speech issues on college campuses.  Speaking this month at Georgetown Law School, Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued that American post-secondary education has become “a shelter for fragile egos.” The accusations are caustic in tone and serious in content. This puts universities in a rather difficult position. Individual instances of bedlam can be cherrypicked, and caricatures of college students as sheltered weaklings are easy to draw. These are the terms of the culture wars, and Harvard is by no means exempt from the struggle.
The most important organization in the free speech debate at Harvard is the Harvard College Open Campus Initiative. According to its Facebook page, HCOCI “exists to encourage a diverse discourse on Harvard's campus, and to push back against ideological forces in academia, and in society more broadly, that hinder open discussion and freedom of speech.” To this end, the club invites controversial speakers to campus for discussions of new ideas.
It is a young organization. It welcomed its first comp class this semester, and it has thus far hosted only three events. The first was a moderated conversation with Professor Jordan B. Peterson. Peterson is fairly controversial for his views on transgender individuals, and sharp, intelligent, questioning turned the event into a success.
After the solid event with Professor Peterson, HCOCI took the bold step of inviting Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak at Harvard. Murray is an extremely controversial figure, considered a racist by many and a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center. All things considered, the event went reasonably well. Students organized a protest outside as well as a contemporaneous counterpanel designed to attack Murray’s ideas. Inside the auditorium, protest consisted of a few students silently holding up signs, then leaving to attend the counterpanel. No one was physically assaulted, and Murray was allowed to complete his presentation.
This contrasts sharply with Murray’s treatment at Middlebury College, where he was first driven from the auditorium and then harassed as he tried to escape. In an interview, Murray told me the contrast in treatment owed primarily to Harvard’s “terrific police force,” specifically praising the “ten motorcycle policemen” Harvard had on hand but never needed to use.
In a longer Weekly Standard article, he also attributed Harvard’s success to the fact that “the adults were in charge.” There is something worrying about the creeping sense of authoritarianism here. Murray is right to praise Harvard police officers as tremendous professionals, but free expression should not require an armed escort. New ideas should not be imposed on students under the threat of sanction.
Furthermore, why was this sort of show of force necessary? More simply, why was Murray protested in the first place? He honestly seems to have no idea. In the Weekly Standard, he rambles about “the guys in ski masks,” “PC orthodoxy,” and most opaquely, “the mob.” In our interview, he was emphatic: “I don’t know why I’m being protested!” In his view, the “purported reasons for protesting are bullshit!” Murray went as far as to claim he had never said or written anything “that sounded remotely like a white supremacist.”
The most interesting thing about Charles Murray is not his books or his lectures. It’s his naïveté. Few are the men on earth who can write, “Latino and black immigrants are, at least in the short run, putting some downward pressure on the distribution of intelligence,” and then claim to have never written anything that “sounded remotely like a white supremacist.”
Similarly astonishing is his capacity to cite Nazi race scientists and modern eugenicists, and then be authentically surprised when people get angry. In 1960, Murray burned a cross in Newton, Iowa. Unsurprisingly, Murray was shocked when local black people complained. This is a lifelong pattern of behavior; he is the kind of person who throws stones and hides his hands.  A measure of self-awareness would not make Charles Murray a good man, but it would make him a less loathsome one.
It is obvious why students are upset. Labeling women bad at abstract thinking, placing the average IQ of a welfare mother at “around 80,” and claiming black and Hispanic students in elite colleges often “‘don’t belong there’ academically” is more than bad science. Telling a Hispanic student that his or her kind is comparatively unintelligent means insulting not only that student, but all of his or her ancestors and progeny.
Murray’s ideas can and should be read as the opening salvo in a larger conflict over whether women and minorities belong in places of prestige. And while words are not themselves violent, it is simplistic to argue they cannot cause harm. Few, for example, can defend the non-physical bullying and cyberbullying of children as harmless. The tangibility of an injury is unrelated to its seriousness. So, when gay, black, Hispanic, Jewish, or transgender students say they are hurt, the only reasonable choice is to believe them.
This is the crux of the issue. As Murray reasonably noted in our interview, universities must be dedicated to “the search for truth.” That search necessarily involves reckoning with dangerous, inflammatory, and mendacious characters. Unique ideas help the College avoid intellectual stagnancy, but a balance must be struck between academic freedom and basic kindness.
HCOCI’s intentions were good, but they missed the mark with Murray. HCOCI billed the event as a discussion of populism and the rise of our current president. It was silly to invite Murray to campus to discuss President Donald Trump, since Murray is academically important only for his ideas about the intellectual elite and societal distribution of intelligence. Beyond this, Murray is nowhere near the forefront of research on the rise of populism in America. Better and kinder thinkers were available to discuss political trends. Even Murray, however, was likely better than the OCI’s third speaker.
WELL, ARE WE?
On September 19, HCOCI jointly hosted an event titled, “Are We Killing Free Speech?”, with the Harvard Libertarian Club and the Ayn Rand Institute. What could have been an opportunity to meaningfully debate free speech issues descended into an embarrassing exercise in propaganda. The evangelizing began with students being coercively added to the Ayn Rand Institute’s mailing list and then having copies of Steve Simpson’s book “Defending Free Speech” foisted on them.
The event was a panel discussion between Steve Simpson, a lawyer with the Ayn Rand Institute, and Bret Weinstein, an ex-biology professor at Evergreen State University. The event began when when HCOCI President Conor Healy ’19 read the University policy on free speech and expression, provoking derisive  laughter in the audience.
The subsequent discussion was all quarterbacked by unctuous sycophant and YouTube personality Dave Rubin. The primary issue with the talk was that all three panelists had the same view on essentially every issue. All three men claim to be First Amendment absolutists, and so most of the event was dedicated to each man praising the other in turn. Meaningful disagreement did not functionally exist.
At one point, Simpson, the lawyer, began arguing that demonstrations on public land are an illegitimate form of speech, and therefore, that the government should simply shut down all demonstrations on public property from groups it sees as bad. Ironically, this sort of content-based government discrimination against certain ideas strikes at the core of the First Amendment.
Besides Professor Weinstein asking for clarification, no one in the auditorium bothered to push back at all against Simpson’s repressive concept of allowable expression. Rubin deserves the most blame for this, but HCOCI and the Libertarian Club are complicit. Rubin is a professional yes-man, and his YouTube channel consists largely of softball interviews with prominent conservatives. The guy nods for a living.
“Are We Killing Free Speech?” was a bad moment, but HCOCI deserves another chance. If the organization has been disingenuous in “encouraging a broad discourse on campus,” its self-awareness is its silver lining. Asked about the panel, club president Healy said, “They agreed on far too much. There is no need for disagreement for disagreement’s sake, but when we’re talking about something like this you can do better on that front.”
Healy also expressed misgivings about Simpson’s illiberalism, noting that HCOCI has “done basically two and a half events.” He considers the panel, “basically a half event for us. It’s a learning process, we’re learning each time.” Healy also expressed legitimate concern about students who felt alienated by HCOCI speakers, saying he felt “like shit” the morning Murray arrived on campus because he knew other people would be hurt.
HCOCI’s leadership had other encouraging perspectives. Club treasurer Caden W. Petersmeyer ’19 noted that when deciding on speakers for events, the group does not rush to judgement. Instead, “people think about it, people do research,” and then members make educated decisions on whether a speaker deserves an invitation. Petersmeyer also argued that “Charles Murray’s treatment at Middlebury was unacceptable,” and that this was a major reason the HCOCI decided to invite him. Here Petersmeyer is unconvincing. Harvard has no obligation to clean up Middlebury’s mess, and Charles Murray is a vicious person of limited academic repute.
In fairness, HCOCI is not the only organization at Harvard misjudging invitations. The Institute of Politics, for example, has given fellowships to Trump castoffs Sean Spicer and Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski has a long history of sexually inappropriate and intimidating behavior toward female reporters. Sean Spicer is a worldwide celebrity because of his willingness to tell easily verifiable lies to the American people. It is more than incongruous for a university with “Veritas” as its motto to invite such a weak-willed fabulist. Harvard is on unsteady ground indeed when it pontificates about freedoms of press.
The balance between academic speech and basic kindness can be a tricky one to strike. Given the fact that HCOCI has been in the national media spotlight for some months now, it is odd that, according to club president Healy, the administration has provided no oversight of HCOCI. In fact, he claims, “they have never offered any input, positive or negative in terms of what we’ve chosen to do.” Charles Murray, then, is wrong: When Harvard invites speakers to campus, the adults are not in charge. There is little evidence that HCOCI has actual malice toward anyone, but they make crucial decisions with no guidance from the administration. Disaster could strike.
“SHADOWBOXING”
Milo Yiannopoulos could be one such a disaster. In an interview with The Crimson, Yiannopoulos argued that “in the rarified air of abstract political discourse, conservatives lose,” since they lack the “balls,” “spunk,” and “stomach” for the fight. Yiannopoulos, on the other hand, says that he comes to college campuses and “sets them on fire. Literally in some cases.”
Yiannopolous argued that outing DACA recipients was a “good idea,” and claimed one of the biggest threats to free speech was “human resources departments staffed by angry single women in their forties, who just want someone to hurt because life has hurt them.” He labeled his nationwide tour the “Dangerous Faggot Tour,” and in the interview I referenced it as the “Dangerous, you know, tour.” This rewording vexed Yiannopolous, who proceeded to call me a “bitch” and “monkey” for refusing to say “faggot.”
Yiannopolous is more than a polemicist; he bullies and abuses other people and then argues his critics are brainwashed. HCOCI’s decision to avoid inviting him is therefore encouraging. Healy argued Milo would be a “misuse of our resources” because he lacked “a suite of ideas to offer in the way other people do.” This is precisely the sort of critical balance HCOCI should be striking, and it is good to see them get it right.
Georgetown distinguished scholar in residence Sanford J. Ungar ’66, who also teaches a coveted Harvard freshman seminar on free speech, argued that a lot of contentious speaking events on college campuses are like “shadowboxing.” Conservatives and liberals spar without direct contact, goading each other into violence. Ungar elaborated: “everyone knows they will be protested, everyone knows in some cases there will be violence, everyone knows in some cases there will be vast expenditures.”
Ungar argued that, drama aside, it is unclear that “people actually want to hear some of these speakers.” This is a critical cause of the issues on campus. Conservative groups have an incentive to bait the opposition by inviting sickening people like Yiannopolous, and liberal groups have an incentive to ignore and condemn conservative speakers regardless of their seriousness and legitimacy. Harvard students should be proud of our comparative success in these sorts of issues.
It is certainly unfortunate that Betsy DeVos was yelled at on her visit to Bethune Cookman. I hope her feelings were not hurt, but historically black colleges and universities were founded as a response to segregation. So, when DeVos clumsily referred to them as “pioneers” of “school choice,” she should have known she was not making friends. DeVos’s fetishistic obsession with school choice gutted Michigan public schools. This, as well as the prevailing sentiment that she is unqualified, have won her little support. There is little in her record to suggest DeVos has the necessary wherewithal to be evil, but despite this the Bethune students were broadly in the right. She made her bed and she lies in it. These are the wages of a free society.
Despite all of DeVos’s failures, Harvard students treated her fairly this month. She was laughed at and silently protested, but she was also listened to and tolerated. She was yelled at, but only after the event was over and she was walking off of stage. This is what should be aimed for—lively but relatively non-disruptive protest, as well as open-mindedness. Holding up a bed sheet with “Our Students are Not For Sale” written on it does not violate anyone’s freedom of expression.
There is nothing inimical to free speech about waiting until someone finishes talking and then stating a contrary opinion. Heated, polarized, and aggressive debates are good for countries and universities. At the same time, freedom of speech is not freedom from consequence. Harvard should be accepting of fresh thinkers and ideas, but should balance that interest against the quite valid perspectives of students. Both sides will have to give some ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I imagine Catholics and Protestants can agree that Martin Luther was an enormously consequential figure, as many of their contemporary theological thinkers and writers have expounded on. Even secular publications took note this October 31—the anniversary of the Protestant Reformation—of the monumental impact of Luther’s declarations.
There’s one thread in this vigorous and robust discussion of what Luther had actually intended in his theses and what being Lutheran might mean now that I find quite compelling, and has shaped a great deal of my thinking on the Reformation. In one of my all-time favorite articles from First Things—an interreligious, nonpartisan research and educational organization whose pages have been graced with some of the modern era’s most profound Christian thinkers—Gilbert Meilaender, a Lutheran, writes the following:
“…those in the Lutheran communion of the church catholic need to learn…to acknowledge the important contributions a magisterium [church authority] can sometimes make to the life of the Church…those in the Roman communion of that same church catholic must be reminded that the believer’s encounter with the risen Lord is not always mediated through the voice of that magisterium and that the Church is also well served when its people…examine the Scriptures daily ‘to see if these things [are] so.’”
Essentially, Protestants can acknowledge the significant role the Roman Catholic Church plays in its more institutional functions while Roman Catholics can acknowledge that faith can be furthered outside those institutional functions. I reproduce this quote almost in its entirety because I find this piece such a powerful vision for the reconciliation of yearning for catholic orthodoxy, appropriate respect for ecclesiastical authority, and fulfilling personal faith. It gives me hope that there is a way for two faith traditions that often seem themselves at odds to rediscover some of their shared first truths.
With this idea in mind, I am not convinced that Catholics’ and Protestants’ (often, quite considerable) intellectual efforts are always best spent discrediting each other. To be sure, real and meaningful contributions to the church arise out of rigorous examination and discourse. This can often entail challenging self-examination, as Meilaender continues with a quote from Soren Kirkegaard, a 19th century Danish theologian: “Taken by itself, as the whole of Christianity, the Lutheran corrective produces the most subtle type of worldliness and paganism.”
In other words, while Lutheranism (and Protestantism at large) were necessary corrective forces for a Roman Catholic Church caught up in the buying and selling of grace, as a separate Christianity, Protestantism can easily fall victim to the same kind of worldliness.
I can see that Kirkegaard’s thinking here might have some critical concerns for American mainstream Protestantism today. It is not hard to wonder whether Sunday worship services that look more like rock concerts with sound stages and equipment to rival actual concert venues might reflect a worldliness that mistakenly conflates musical worship (which is certainly an important part of historic Christian liturgy) with entertainment. Mega-churches are run almost like mega-corporations, preachers can be celebrities, and being a “Christian” can be easily compartmentalized as the “religious” bucket of your life alongside your social life, studies, relationships, and more. There are Christians who only are Christians on Christmas and Easter, and Christians who attend every service but do not know Christ.
Perhaps it is the case that this kind of Christianity, which courses throughout much of the country, is in need of another Reformation, one that might actually be more aptly coined a Return to more orthodox, traditional, and historic Christian liturgy and practices firmly rooted in Scripture. I don’t necessarily see orthodoxy as the oppressive and rigid systems of rules and dogma that secular society often thinks it is. Rather, I see Christian orthodoxy as an orientation of my entire being towards Christ, and not just certain parts of me, and I believe I am coming to the conclusion that this does not necessitate converting to Catholicism.
When I came to college and confronted for the first time the magnitude of the Christian gospel, I realized I could not compartmentalize Christianity anymore. As C.S. Lewis so beautifully wrote, “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” My identity in Christ cannot be one part of me out of many, but my entire form. My hope is that all those who are earnestly seeking Christ in such a way would call themselves Christians before they call themselves Catholics or Protestants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s next President and Vice President will lead the UC and the College through a pivotal year on campus, given University President Drew G. Faust’s departure and other University-wide changes. The candidates’ input on social group policy, space and accessibility, and student health, among other issues, will have lasting effects on life at the College. With this in mind, while all three tickets for UC leadership bring valuable ideas to the table, we endorse the candidacy of Catherine L. Zhang ’19 for President and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 for Vice President.
As the only ticket containing two current UC representatives, Zhang and Boucher would bring a wealth of experience to the UC leadership. As we have previously opined, the UC is often hampered by unrealistic campaign promises and low turnout in its elections. Yet, given Zhang and Boucher’s achievements on the Council—Zhang’s role as a leader of and participant in a wide range of successful initiatives, and Boucher’s advances regarding fundraising and technology—we believe that they have the potential to meaningfully impact the Council.
The Zhang-Boucher ticket’s commitment to accountability is appealing. While their aims are as lofty as those of their peers, Zhang and Boucher put a greater emphasis on transparency than the others in the race. Their promise to place a “progress bar” on each of their initiatives is a promising way to show the student body the extent to which they’ve followed through. Accountability and openness to criticism are paramount for individuals seeking to represent the entire student body, and we are particularly hopeful about Zhang and Boucher in that regard.
This is not to say, however, that the Zhang-Boucher ticket is completely without fault. Perhaps most saliently, its website conspicuously lacks a stance on the social group policies that some decry. Their stance was clarified during The Crimson-hosted Crossfire Debate on Sunday, and even though they acknowledged the need for some kind of sanctions on final clubs, they do not publicly support the current social group sanctions policy.
Nevertheless, Zhang and Boucher’s commitment to building social spaces on campus, with special attention to first-year, accessible, and House-based spaces, in addition to their advocacy for a multicultural center and their plans to fund social initiatives, shows a focus on inclusivity beyond the debate on unrecognized social organizations.
Furthermore, because every ticket has valuable ideas unique to its platform, the next UC President and Vice President, whomever they may be, can best serve the campus by deeply engaging with and evaluating the other candidates’ proposals. Besides Zhang and Boucher’s aims, Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and running mate Michael K. Bervell ’19 offer a plethora of interesting initiatives, as does the third ticket of Conor Healy ’19 and running mate Parth C. Thakker ’19.
Ultimately, the most important qualities the next UC leader should possess are a fundamental understanding of the concerns of the student body, and an enthusiasm in a reasonable plan to implement policy. Zhang and Boucher’s extensive experience on the UC, transparency with regard to their progress, and tangible plans to finance their initiatives make them the best choice for the coming year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students will take to the polls this week to vote to extend Thanksgiving break and retain “Harvard Time”—but Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said it’s not that simple.
Four referenda will appear on this week’s ballot for Undergraduate Council President and Vice President, and the UC will adopt passed referenda as its official stance.
One such referendum seeks to extend Thanksgiving break to the Monday and Tuesday before the holiday for all undergraduates. But in an interview last week, Smith said administrators arrived at the current schedule after in-depth discussions held nearly a decade ago.
“I would just encourage the UC voters, the appropriate people on the UC, to go ask the questions and know what happened in the past so they can understand what’s already been evaluated,” Smith said. “It’s not to say that it can’t be evaluated again, but this is a topic that has been discussed in the past.”
Originally, according to Smith, students had to attend school on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, but a few years ago the University opted to observe Veteran’s Day and extend the time off for Thanksgiving.
“It’s not that we don’t value our veterans but it was the right thing to do from an educational point of view,” Smith said. “This whole question of, ‘Could I have the rest of the week off?’ was kind of discussed at that time too when we made that change.”
Another referendum demands that the College keep the informal seven minutes of passing time between classes known as “Harvard Time.” Starting in the fall of 2018, the College will transition to a more rigidly structured schedule: Professors will choose from a set of designated start times for their classes and there will be fifteen minutes of passing time between each class.
Smith said he was unaware this was a controversial proposal.
“We could just call that fifteen minutes ‘Harvard Time’ if you want,” he said. “Harvard Time was a sloshy seven minutes.”
Part of impetus for the new schedule is the upcoming expansion of Harvard’s engineering campus into Allston. Students will have 45 minutes of passing time between classes on the two campuses in Cambridge and Allston. Smith said the schedule is being rolled out before the move in fall 2020 to catch any potential bugs in the system.
“This was all done to ensure that no matter how mobile you are, you can get from place to place,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an at-times contentious debate Sunday evening, the three tickets vying to become the next leaders of the Undergraduate Council sparred over policies outlined in their respective platforms and discussed the College’s sanctions against single-gender social groups.
The fourth annual “Crimson Crossfire” debate—hosted by The Crimson—took place Sunday evening in Harvard Hall between this year’s three tickets: Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, Victor C. Agbafe ’19 and Michael K. Bervell ’19, and Conor Healy ’19 and Parth C. Thakker ’19. 
Zhang and Boucher, the only ticket comprising two current UC representatives, stressed their promise to develop a more transparent and accountable leadership style through the introduction of online “progress bars” that would track the status of each of their 39 campaign promises.
“Specifically on the idea of transparency, that’s why we’re proposing that we will create progress bars for every single campaign promise we list so that you can hold us accountable for what we say,” Zhang said.
Agbafe and Bervell focused on their proposal to create a $250,000 social fund to help improve campus social life, though some attendees said they were skeptical about the candidates’ ability to fundraise that money. In response, Agbafe and Bervell suggested seeking external corporate and alumni sponsors.
In an exchange that quickly grew heated, Boucher said he was doubtful the UC could remain independent and apolitical if Agbafe and Bervell sought such sponsorships.
“When someone gives money they expect something... People expect big things,” Boucher said.
Bervell responded that he and Agbafe would stop the sponsorship if a corporate sponsor tried to inappropriately determine the use of money donated.
Healy and Thakker, by contrast, devoted much of the debate to changes they proposed to the UC’s administrative structure. The candidates hope to restructure both the representative election system and the process by which the UC selects students to serve on University committees.
“It’s borne out by the numbers that the Undergraduate Council does not represent the student population,” Healy said. “This structural change is inevitable and we want to do it hearing from students rather than letting the administration take that action years down the line.”
To start off the debate, moderators questioned candidates about the administration’s social group sanctions, which—starting with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships. The tickets varied in their stances on the social group policy.
Zhang and Boucher said that, though they do not support the sanctions in their current state, they broadly support administrative efforts to change the “status quo.” The other two tickets—Healy and Thakker, as well as Agbafe and Bervell—took an anti-penalties stance. Healy and Thakker called for an end to all administrative attempts to restrict undergraduate social life and were critical of College-sponsored parties.
Voting for the 2017 UC elections opens at noon on Monday, Nov. 13 and closes at noon on Thursday, Nov. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A petition for a University-wide research center for race and ethnicity has garnered over 500 votes of support on an online forum for Harvard affiliates over the last week.
The petition, posted on Solution Space—a online platform developed by a University-wide diversity task force—quickly became by far the site’s most popular. Authored by founder of the Ethnic Studies Coalition Juhwan Seo ’17, it comes weeks comes after the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging released a draft executive summary, which did not explicitly call for an ethnic studies program or center. Activists have requested such a program for years.
Seo’s petition envisioned the program “as a national hub” for ethnic studies.
“This center would support the study of race and ethnicity among Harvard’s 12 schools, including a robust undergraduate and graduate ethnic studies program within [the Faculty of Arts and Sciences], which has been the subject of 12 community-wide petitions in 45 years,” the petition reads.
The task force’s draft does include a proposal suggesting that Harvard create University-wide research centers for “Identity, Politics, and Culture” and “Inclusion and Belonging.” But after the draft’s release, ethnic studies advocates raised concerns about the lack of language addressing race and ethnicity throughout the report, especially in relation to ethnic studies.
Government professor and task force co-chair Danielle S. Allen has called ethnic studies a “College-specific” issue. Seo’s petition calls for a University-wide center, rather than just one for the College, a change he hopes will allow the task force “to actually incorporate our views while also making recommendations that the University can actually implement.”
“After we did some advocacy to the task force about ethnic studies, the response we got very loud and clear was that ethnic studies is an FAS-specific issue,” Seo said. “We sympathize with that view because I understand the task force is supposed to be coming up with recommendations for the entire University and not for a specific school.”
The petition mentioned Yale, Columbia, and Stanford—three peer institutions with centers concentrating on race and ethnicity—as points of comparison.
“I think it’s actually irresponsible for Harvard to train its students without giving them education and resources, knowledge and research on race and ethnicity,” Seo said.
Allen said that it is “exciting” to see the Solution Space being used and that the trending petition aligns with the existing recommendation, which she said “does have a university-wide center for research in the area of identity, politics, and culture, which includes race, ethnicity, and all these other identities.”
Allen said that after the final version of the report it will be up to the faculty “to answer the question of what would be the most effective and powerful research center that can be designed.”
Two student groups, the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies, and Native Americans at Harvard College, and three alumni groups—the Asian American Alumni Alliance, Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, and the Latino Alumni Alliance—co-signed Seo’s petition.
William Oh ’18, a member of both the task force and the Ethnic Studies Coalition, said the more than 500 votes came not only from undergraduates, but also graduate students and alumni. He called the effort “largely an email and social media campaign.”
Oh said the task force expects to release a final report early next semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first Black Health Matters conference kicked off in Cambridge this weekend with panels and workshops focused on health disparities in the black community.
Saturday’s lectures and panels highlighted statistical differences in health outcomes between black and white Americans, while Sunday’s open workshops featured presenters exploring options for affecting change. Tania N. Fabo ’18 and Sarah B. Gutema ’19 organized the conference, which took place at Northwest Labs.
Fabo said she decided to organize the conference because she wanted to create a space for people to discuss solutions to health disparities.
“When we came up with the idea for the event we didn’t want people coming and learning and leaving with nothing,” Fabo said. “You leave with these frustrations but you don’t have a mechanism to put these frustrations into action.”
Fabo said the idea of the conference came after taking classes focused on medical ethics and health disparities. The event drew attendees with similar interests.
“I am interested in racial inequalities, especially health disparities, between people of color and whites in America,” conference attendee Christie A. Jackson ’21 said.
The conference opened Friday night with a screening of “Unnatural Causes: When the Bough Breaks,” a documentary about high infant mortality rates in black community.
Although originally intended for Harvard students, a mixed audience of working professionals, students from surrounding universities, and concerned Cambridge residents attended the conference.
Yvonne A. Wingard, a sophomore from Brown University, said she appreciated the conference’s efforts to empower those attending. Wingard said she originally felt helpless in the face of health issues in the black community, but the conference made her realize that even as a student she could do something substantive to address those issues.
“You can get frustrated about certain issues that happen but you think ‘I can’t do anything about it’ but this got me thinking,” Wingard said, “I can of course definitely talk with professors and staff members, but you can also reach out to the community itself.”
Another key aspect of the conference, Fabo said, was to unite researchers and members of the black community.
“I think that a lot of times there are conferences where there is this idea of separation where you have all these elites talking about issues without really talking to the community members that are affected by them,” Fabo said.
At the end of the weekend, attendees said they felt they left the conference with a greater understanding of the complexities behind health issues in the black community.
“Coming to this conference... exposed me to so many other forms of public health and so many other ways people can get involved. It doesn’t have to just be science and research,” Wingard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 14, 2017 at 2:31 p.m.
Harvard commemorated its military service members, both living and deceased, with a Veterans Day Ceremony held in Memorial Church on Saturday morning.
University President Drew G. Faust and dozens of Harvard alumni, students, and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps members attended the ceremony. It was organized by the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization and featured speakers from several branches of the military.
The ceremony also included the dedication of a plaque recognizing four lieutenants for their service during World War II: George L. Fox,  Alexander D. Goode, John P. Washington, and Clark V. Poling, all graduates of Harvard’s Army Chaplain School, a short program that prepared ordained ministers to work for the army.
The four chaplains were stationed on a vessel that was struck by a German U-boat on Feb. 3, 1943. The four men gave up their own lifejackets, offering prayers and assistance as their fellow sailors evacuated the sinking ship, according to a speech prepared for the event by Tom Reardon ’68.  All four died when the ship went under.
Because the men did not meet the exact qualifications for the Medal of Honor, Reardon said in his speech, an equivalent award—called the Four Chaplains Medal—was created specifically for the men.
In addition to the dedication of the plaque, the ceremony featured a performance by Sydney T. S. Mukasa ’18, who sang “Dirge for Two Veterans,” as well as a reading of John McCrae’s poem “In Flanders Fields” by Army veteran and Alumnus of the Business and Kennedy Schools Dan Fisher.
Harvard ROTC member Phillip M. Ramirez ’18, an inactive Crimson editor, said that he thinks it is important to celebrate Veterans Day.
“It’s really important to remember Harvard’s long legacy of service, especially now that ROTC is kind of rebuilding itself after having not been on campus for a little while,” Ramirez said.
Harvard’s ROTC program returned in 2011 after almost 40 years off campus.
Since ROTC returned to campus, the Harvard Veterans Alumni Organization has been working to admit more veterans to Harvard College. Later in the ceremony, a new initiative designed to accomplish this goal was unveiled: Harvard is entering into a partnership called “Vetlink” with Service to Schools, a non-profit that provides college application assistance to veterans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student groups recommended by the Undergraduate Council to be denied recognition will have 24 hours to appeal the decisions, which the body will finalize at a special meeting on Tuesday.
“What we’ll be doing now is allowing an appeal process to student groups that have been, as of now, deemed not to be allowed to grow,” said UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18.
To obtain College recognition, applicants for new student groups must go through a multi-step process. Applicants submit a proposal, meet with Harvard administrators, and then the UC Rules Committee votes on whether the UC should recommend them for approval. On Sunday, the Council planned to review the recommendations and forward the proposals for a final “rubber-stamp” from the Committee on Student Life.
The UC gained broad powers to recommend new student groups for approval in April following years of a process where the authority rested with a student-faculty committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Prior to the UC’s general meeting, the UC Rules Committee voted to recommend 37 club applications for approval and 23 for denial in another closed door meeting. Following the 24-hour appeal process which will conclude Monday, the Rules Committee may vote to overturn their original recommendations.
Evan M. Bonsall ’19, who chairs the UC Rules Committee, said he considers the UC’s role in club recognition to be an important one, adding that the Council should give it “all the time it deserves.”
“We’ll ask them to address concerns expressed by the UC, and they’ll have 24 hours to do so,” Bonsall said. “We will potentially reconsider. Although, certainly, those groups could still be not approved.”
The Committee on Student Life delegated this responsibility to the UC after putting the recognition process on pause for spring 2016.  The College’s Office of Student Life did not accept applications for new student organizations during this time as the approval process underwent a rewrite.
Office of Student Life administrators and UC representatives had concerns about the proliferation of recognized student groups in recent years, leading to difficulties in funding, strains on reservations for campus spaces, and unchecked growth.
The UC also voted to pass an amendment that now prevents caucuses from endorsing UC candidates. Legislation supporting caucuses passed in April, six months after a similar piece of legislation was narrowly defeated.
Any caucuses that endorsed presidential candidates will now be forced to cease publicizing their endorsements and delete any social media posts that incorporate endorsements.
Adams House representative Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 said he thinks endorsing candidates is an integral part of caucuses’ roles.
“Representation is tied into the original caucus legislation. For us to take away the right for them to say what they, as members of this community, want and believe in, to me, extremely problematic,” he said.
Others, like Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20, said discussions within caucuses about endorsing candidates may cause division between members and prevent them from working cooperatively in the future.
“If they have conversations that are extremely contentious and deal with personal characteristics, I don’t want to have that conversation with people that I’m supposed to be working with in the future in order to represent people later on,” she said.
The UC also allocated $125 to pay for candy and campaign literature at voting booths across the dining halls during the UC’s election period. The voting booths will be staffed by members who have not endorsed tickets.

The Undergraduate Council’s recent survey on single-gender social organizations possessed a number of methodological flaws, according to survey design experts, lending weight to criticism that emerged in the wake of the survey’s release on Wednesday.
Results from the survey, which UC leaders sent to University President Drew G. Faust last week, indicated that 61 percent of respondents opposed penalties on social groups. Yet only 28 percent of undergraduates participated in the survey, leading some students and experts to question the study’s validity.
Chase H. Harrison, the Associate Director of the Harvard Program on Survey Research, pointed out that the survey may have suffered from non-response bias, a phenomenon in which those with strong feelings about the survey’s subject are more likely to respond than those without strong feelings on the subject.
“Without some attempt to measure who responded, adjust who responded, it’s difficult to know what to make of it,” Harrison said.
Harvard’s current policy, which took effect for the Class of 2021, bars members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding athletic team captaincies, becoming leaders of various campus groups, and receiving College endorsements for prestigious fellowships.
Government Professor Gary King, who directs the Institute of Quantitative Social Science, said that without a survey question about club affiliations, it is difficult to tell whether or not members of single-gender social organizations disproportionately responded to the survey.
“They didn’t collect the information, so you can’t even know. And that’s the problem,” he said.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 sent a link to the survey to undergraduates on Oct. 26, and closed the survey eight days later. The survey did not prompt  respondents for their social group affiliation.
“We weren’t able to do a randomized, selective survey sort of thing, for a number of reasons—one of which is a lot of the lists of students in these organizations are not public, so we wouldn’t have really known where to start there,” Sachee, who is a member of the Bee Club, said.
Donald B. Rubin, a professor of statistics, pointed out the importance of effective follow-up, which he suggested was lacking in the UC survey.
“There are other kinds of adjustment that you can do that is based on how long it takes for somebody to respond,” he said.  “Some people will respond at the next attempt.”
 Amid criticism, Khansarinia downplayed the importance of the quantitative data from the survey.
“I think if people had taken the time to read the five-page report in its entirety, they would have known that we have already discussed these things at length—they would have known that we took so much value from the long comments and didn’t place a huge amount of value on, you know, the shock value numbers of 60 percent say this, 20 percent say this, because we knew the limitations of the survey,” he said in an interview.
Although the UC report prefaces its findings with an acknowledgment that the survey was “imperfect in many ways,” it goes on to state that “proposed alternatives” to the sanctions are “still unpopular.” The report decries an option proposing a full ban on social groups, pointing to the survey as evidence of its unpopularity.
“Following our study of this issue, we firmly believe that a full ban of social groups would violate students’ right to choice and would be ineffective,” the report said.
The report calls on Faust to choose a policy solution between a total ban and the status quo. Faust said in an interview earlier this month that she will make a final decision after the next Faculty meeting in December.

UPDATED: November 13, 2017 at 2:29 p.m.
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative—the $45 billion philanthropic organization founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan ’07—is giving $12.1 million to help low-income students engage in public service, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Monday.
The grant will last for 15 years and provide financial assistance for up to 2,300 Harvard students who want to participate in public service programs run by the Phillips Brooks House Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship, which coordinates community service efforts at the College.
“It’s my hope this gift will give many more students the ability to choose service that will inspire their passion and build their skills as the next generation of public service leaders,” Chan said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette.
The grant will be split into two primary parts: one, the Priscilla Chan Summer Service Award, will cover the summer earnings contribution for students who choose to spend the summer working for either the Center for Public Interest Careers, the Institute of Politics, or the Phillips Brooks House Association—a student-run community service group. The second portion, the Priscilla Chan Stride Service Program, will go towards helping the Phillips Brooks House Association provide year-round community service fellowships for low-income students.
In an email to students Monday, Khurana also said the grant will provide “bridge funding” for several of the College’s ongoing efforts to grow public service at Harvard.
In interviews with the University-run Gazette and emailed announcements, Harvard administrators praised the gift.
“This generous gift will provide opportunities for even more of Harvard’s remarkable and committed undergraduates to follow Priscilla’s example of community service while at the College,” University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview with the Gazette.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A deep three-point jumper from Bryce Aiken with 1.9 seconds left to play lifted the Harvard men’s basketball team to a wild 70-67 overtime victory over Massachusetts on Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
It was a day of career highs and redemption for the sophomore guard as Aiken made up for a missed layup that would have given the Crimson (2-0) the win in regulation. All told, the Randolph, N.J., native finished the matinee with career highs in both points (30) and rebounds (eight).
“It was a great shot,” Aiken said. “We were in the huddle talking about it. We didn’t want them to get the three, but they did. I said if there was still time on the clock, ‘Just give me the ball I got it, I’ll win it for us.’”
The bout was another chapter in the storied rivalry between two of the Bay State’s basketball heavyweights. UMass (1-1) took last year’s matchup by four and had won the last three matchups in the series. Sunday’s matchup bore several similarities to the 2014 edition, as an and-one from Wesley Saunders ’15 in the game’s final minute lifted Harvard to a 75-73 win over the Minutemen.
“Every time we have been able to lock horns with UMass—all our games we’ve played in this series—have been hard fought games, they’ve been possession games, they’ve been exciting games, and I think this tops all of that in terms of the ending,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
While Aiken stole the show for the Crimson, sophomore guard Luwane Pipkins was the marksman for the guests on Sunday. With his team trailing by three with 12.6 seconds to play in regulation, the Chicago native took the ball the length of the floor, pulled up, and drilled a triple—only the second of the day for his team—in Harvard freshman guard Mario Haskett’s face.
Faced with an almost identical situation with 17.5 seconds left in the extra session, Pipkins struck for a second time. This time around, UMass guard C.J. Anderson, who had the hot hand after scoring his team’s first four points in overtime, brought the ball up the floor but eventually found Pipkins, who was being guarded by sophomore wing Justin Bassey, the Crimson’s top perimeter defender. The new matchup made no difference for the 5’11” floor general, as Pipkins found the bottom of the net despite the 6’5” Bassey’s best efforts.
“It was a fun game to play,” Aiken said. “It was the teams going back and forth, we would get a bucket, they would get a bucket. It really just came down to stops. Luckily enough, we got a few stops here and there and we just tried to grind and fight.”
Rather than taking his last timeout, Amaker let his team push the ball as the final eight seconds began to tick off the clock. Much like how Pipkins had during regulation, Aiken raced against time with a full head of steam. Milliseconds after passing the crimson H at center court, the sophomore guard elevated. And hit. A last-second heave by the Minutemen barely clipped the left side of the backboard.
“Depending on what the amount of time left on the clock is, we prefer to play through it on a broken floor,” Amaker said. “Sometimes you can stop it, and call a timeout, and allow them to get set and organized, and do something different. [Aiken] had the first one, and it rolled out, and then obviously he drained the second one and carried us. Having it in his hands with a little bit of time is certainly to our advantage.”
The dramatic ending seemed to be a foregone conclusion given the back-and-forth nature of the game’s final stretch. Neither team held more than a one-possession lead for the final 14:21 of regulation. A Chris Baldwin layup with 10:23 to play gave the Minutemen their first advantage since the 4:28 mark of the first half and sent the UMass faithful, which took up nearly two full sections of Lavietes Pavilion, into a frenzy.
With the result still in question with just over a minute and a half to play, Aiken and Pipkins took over for their respective teams. The undersized, hard-nosed guards, each from one of the nation’s top recruiting hotbeds—Aiken from North Jersey and Pipkins from the South Side of Chicago—were putting on a show for the divided arena.
The Crimson’s lead guard missed a jumper that would have pushed his team’s lead to three with 1:34 to play. Twenty-two seconds later, Pipkins drove to the cup, guided in a layup with his right hand and sunk the ensuing free throw. After the make, Aiken almost immediately found junior sharpshooter Corey Johnson for a triple directly in front of the home bench. The Harvard lead stood at one 20 seconds later as Aiken and Pipkins exchanged layups on opposite ends. A pair of free throws by the Crimson guard stretched the lead to three and set the stage for Pipkin’s first round of magic.
“It’s not easy when a team makes a dagger kind of shot and you miss something when you felt like you had the game, you felt like you were in a position to win and now it has to go into overtime,” Amaker said.
The frenetic pace and action-packed final minutes of regulation and overtime were a far cry from the majority of the contest. While the lead changed 18 times on the afternoon, the teams had only combined for 81 points through the game’s first 30 minutes. The first half featured 16 turnovers and only 20 made field goals.
“We still need to do a better job, even if teams score against us, we need to get it out, get it in, and get it up, and we didn’t do that very effectively this afternoon," Amaker said. "We’re hopeful that we’ll get better at it and transition the ball a little better on defense."
While the guards stole the show down the stretch, an intriguing matchup reared its head early on. After being tasked with covering all 215 pounds of MIT forward Tim Roberts two nights ago, Harvard forward Chris Lewis matched up against 6’11”, 310-pound Rashaan Holloway on Sunday. Both players finished with 15 points, Lewis on 11 attempts and Holloway on 13.
“They are great players, their bigs,” Lewis said. “They know what they specialize in, they attack the basket each time the shot goes up on offense and defense. Holloway is an amazing player, great footwork, knows exactly how to play within himself.”
For a UMass team that only returned six players from last season’s team and features four ineligible transfers and a walk-on, on paper, the game did not seem like the barnburner that it turned out to be. Turnovers and poor shooting plagued the Crimson for much of the afternoon and Pipkins and Anderson managed to keep the Minutemen in the game.
As he did in many close games last season, Amaker deferred to Aiken with the game on the line and it paid off. The dagger on Sunday afternoon was another chapter in the book heroic performances by Aiken, who last year willed his team to dramatic wins over Houston and Yale and nearly did so in last season's Ivy League Tournament.
“I think just having that experience from last season under our belt and having that pit in our stomach from [last year’s Yale game], there was no way we would let this game slip away from us," Aiken said. "We came in here today and just had to battle. There was no way we would let it get away from us.”

Here's all the best from your favorite Harvard athletes this past week:
6. “Congrats to Eli Dershwitz for winning gold for the U.S. at the Senior World Cup in Algeria this weekend! #GoCrimson” - Harvard Fencing (@goHFTweet)
And I thought my trip into Boston over the weekend was a journey to a faraway land. Oh well. Congrats Eli!
5. “Walked through some ruins in Pompeii followed by a hike up a volcano at Mt. Vesuvius. Just arrived in Rome.” - Marc Mangiacotti, Men’s Track and Field Coach (@MarcMangiacotti)
You know what they say Marc, when in Rome, walk through some ruins or hike up a volcano or something.
4. “Don’t worry, do what you’re suppose to do and all will fall into place” - Rio Haskett, Men’s Basketball (@MohTG_)
As finals loom on the horizon, I think we could all take a page from Rio’s book and try to calm down.
3. “A woman at the train station thought I was 19. Am I at that age yet where I should be happy that I look younger?" - Amanda Sobhy, Women’s Squash Alum (@itssobhytime)
That’s a good question, Amanda. A better one might be why was a random woman at the train station trying to guess your age?
2. “Imagine if all unhealthy food was healthy and vice versa. So eating right would be pizza, gummies, ice cream and fries. And a cheat meal would be...kale lol #ifonly #maybeinheaven #rehabthoughts” - Jeremy Lin, Men’s Basketball Alum (@JLin7)
A true jack of all trades. He doesn’t just hoop, he obviously still thinks deeply about the big issues in his free time. Thanks for this Jeremy, it really got the cranium cranking.
1. “I want stroke me as my walkup song but I don't think that will go over well” - Elizabeth Shively, Softball (@LizAShively)
Why would that not go over well, Elizabeth? I can’t see anything wrong with that plan whatsoever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving squad entered Saturday’s meet against Cornell and Dartmouth with history on its side. The Crimson has only lost to the Big Red twice in its history, and the last time the Big Green topped Harvard was in 1972.
The fact that the matchup was the Crimson’s season-opener, and home-opener at that, added to the team’s motivation for coming out strong. Harvard has not dropped a dual meet at Blodgett Pool since 2012, and has not  started a campaign with a defeat in eight years.
Sometimes, that kind of historical background is the set-up for a shock upset. Saturday, however, was not one of those times.
Racing in front of a boisterous home crowd, the Crimson (2-0, 2-0 Ivy League) dropped Cornell (1-2, 1-1 Ivy League) and Dartmouth (1-2, 0-2 Ivy), 202-93 and 216-79, respectively, to keep all of its streaks intact. The victories extend Harvard’s string of successes in Ivy League dual meets to 37 consecutive wins.
“This meet set a high bar for us for the rest of the season,” senior Kent Haeffner said. “We want to build off of this victory and perform even better in the meets that lie ahead.”
Harvard’s wins were powered by the usual suspects. The Crimson was dominant in relay events last season, finishing the campaign undefeated in team races and taking top marks in every relay event at the 2017 Ivy League Championships. With the majority of Harvard’s relay lineups returning this year, the same supremacy was on full display on Saturday.
The Crimson took all three of the top spots in both relay events, opening the meet with a decisive win in the 200-yard medley relay. The Harvard A lineup of seniors Koya Osada and Steven Tan and sophomores Daniel Chang and Raphael Marcoux cruised to a victory in 1:28.92. The Crimson’s B and C groups were close behind in the silver and bronze positions, respectively.
Harvard also closed out the contest with a podium sweep in the 400-yard freestyle relay, albeit in an exhibition. In the meet’s final event, the Crimson B lineup of Marcoux, sophomore dean Farris, fifth-year senior Paul O’Hara, and freshman Mahlon Reihman posted the top time, two seconds ahead of the A squad and seven seconds in front of the C lineup. Cornell’s top entry had the next-fastest time, nine seconds behind Harvard’s winning squad.
The Crimson victory also came on the back of a number of typically strong individual performances from the team’s veteran swimmers. Harvard returned eight All-Ivy athletes from last year’s conference championship-winning team, and their experience helped the Crimson to win all but one event on Saturday.
In the second race of the day, junior Logan Houck, who finished third in the event at last year’s Ancient Eight Championship meet, breezed to a win in the 1000-yard freestyle, clocking in at 9:05.77. The Las Vegas, Nev. native touched the wall nearly 24 seconds ahead of junior Gavin Springer in second and a full 30 seconds before third-place Haeffner.
Not to be outdone, junior Brennan Novak picked up a pair of first-place finishes in the 200 and 500-yard freestyle events, with Houck close behind in second in the latter race. Novak was a member of last year’s Ivy League champion 800-yard freestyle relay team and took second at the 2017 Ancient Eight Championships in the 1000 and 1650 freestyle events.
Senior Ed Kim, a 2016-17 All-Ivy swimmer for the Crimson, matched Novak’s feat, securing two individual wins for himself. The Sammamish, Wash. native beat out second-place Marcoux and third-place junior Sebastian Lutz for top marks in the 50-yard freestyle before taking first in the 100-yard butterfly. Senior Koya Osada ended up less than a second behind in silver medal position in the 100 fly.
Elsewhere, Farris, last year’s Ivy League Championship high-point swimmer, won the 100-yard backstroke, and junior Daniel Tran took the top spot in the 200-yard backstroke. Tran finished third in the same event at last year’s conference championships.
Harvard showed the benefits of its experience on the boards, as well. At the Ancient Eight Championship meet last year, the Crimson took three of the top four positions on the individual high-point chart for diving. All three of those athletes, senior David Pfeifer, co-captain Bobby Ross, and sophomore Austin Fields, returned this year, and they combined with freshman Alec DeCaprio to sweep the first four spots in both the one-meter and three-meter events.
Pfeifer’s 354.5 points put him atop the standings for the three-meter dive, with Ross in second, Fields in third, and DeCaprio rounding out the top four. In the second event, it was Ross who took top marks, followed by Pfeifer, DeCaprio, and Fields.
However, despite the considerable role played by Harvard’s veterans, the meet was not without contributions from some new faces. The Crimson’s freshman class had a strong debut meet, while several sophomores showed their improvement from last season with convincing performances.
Rookie Michael Zarian particularly impressed, picking up a pair of wins in the 200 butterfly and the 200 individual medley exhibition. Classmate Eric Whisenant also collected a podium finish, touching the wall second behind Tran in the 200 backstroke, while first-years Levente Bathory and Reihman ended up second and third, respectively, in the 200 freestyle.
The team’s first-years also played a significant part in Harvard’s relay success, with Zarian, Reihman, Bathory, and fellow freshman Corban Rawls all swimming to podium finishes as part of Crimson relay lineups.
“The freshmen swam incredibly well,” Haeffner said. “They've been bringing outstanding energy in practice. It's exciting to see that pay off in competition and we're looking forward to what they can accomplish over the rest of the season.”
Harvard also looked to some of its returners to make an increased impact in Saturday’s meet.
Sophomores Marcoux and Daniel Chang both had strong freshman campaigns, but the pair cemented their place as contributors with this weekend’s contest. Each swimmer won an individual event and took second in another on Saturday.
Marcoux added to his runner-up finish in the 50 freestyle with a narrow victory over second-place Tan in the 100-yard freestyle. Chang traded places with Zarian in the 200-yard breaststroke and 200 individual medley, winning the first event with Zarian in fourth place, before taking second behind the rookie in the 200 IM exhibition.
With its veterans performing well and a strong debut meet under its rookies’ belts, the Crimson may hope that history will repeat itself once again. Harvard has finished each of the last three seasons with an undefeated dual meet record, and the team will be aiming to keep that trend going. For now, though, the Crimson is just focused on its next meet.
“[This weekend’s result] gives us great confidence in our performance and our training for the rest of the season,” Ross said. “We had great energy, and we’re all looking forward to [the team’s next meet against] Columbia now.”

Junior Eli Dershwitz, in the midst of an impressive career of fencing at Harvard, is also an established prominent figure on the international stage. No stranger to world competitions, the Sherborn, Mass. native recently set out overseas searching for more glory.
Dershwitz competed in the Senior World Cup Algeria from Nov. 3-5, where, out of 132 fencers, he captured a gold medal in the sabre category for the United States. The medal was his second career gold on the world circuit.
The result propelled him to a sensational ranking of 10th in the world by the International Fencing Federation. In addition, Dershwitz is the youngest of the top 25 sabre fencers in the world.
In the three-day competition held in Algiers, Algeria, Dershwitz beat Russia’s Veniamin Reshetnikov in the semifinals, 15-14, and Italy’s Enrico Berre, 15-9, in the finals.
Dershwitz’s impressive line of achievements stretch well before his time at Harvard. In 2012, he won a silver medal at the Junior World Championships. In 2013, Dershwitz won gold at the Sosnoweic Junior World Cup. In 2014, he contributed to winning a bronze medal for the United States at the Junior World Championships and won the gold medal at the Budapest Junior World Cup.
In 2015, Derschwitz captured the gold at the Junior World Championships and followed up with a gold medal at the National Division I Championships. In 2016, he was named to the U.S. Olympic Team a finished 19th at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. He became the seventh fencer in Crimson history to compete in the Olympics; at the age of 20, he was the youngest on the American team. In March of that year, he won his first grand prix medal.
In 2017, Dershwitz competed at the World Cup in Madrid, where he won a silver medal; this was his first individual medal on the world stage.
Dershwitz’s career at Harvard has been equally illustrious. As co-captain of the fencing team, he has already acquired first team All-Ivy and All-American honors in both his freshman and sophomore campaigns. In his freshman year, he finished with an 84-14 record, including an impressive 15-0 performance at the Ivy League Round Robbins, leading to the Crimson’s Ivy League Title victory. At the NCAA Championships, he finished third.
In his sophomore year, Dershwitz finished with a 69-10 record in the regular season and became the Men’s Sabre Ivy League Champion. He earned a gold medal at the NCAA Regionals Championship, which qualified him for the NCAA Championships. At the NCAA Championships, Dershwitz bested his previous year’s performance, becoming the NCAA Champion in men’s sabre, becoming the first individual to win a title for Harvard since 2007.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first home meet of the season, the Harvard’s women swim and dive team continued the domination it displayed last weekend against Columbia. The Crimson (2-0, 2-0 Ivy) bested Cornell (1-1, 0-1) in 14 of 16 events, ultimately winning 199.0-96.0 at Blodgett Pool on Sunday.
“We always look forward to having our first home meet,” Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski said. “Last year, it wasn’t until January, so this is really fun to have it in November. Our freshman were very excited to be in front of a home crowd, and it’s at a day and time when a lot of people can make it. So, it’s thrilling for us to be here and it’s great to swim Cornell. They put up some good competition, and it gave us the opportunity to really focus on our race plans and our diving strategies because for us, what matters the most is how we’re going to perform at the end of the season, at the Ivy Championships here in February.”
With the Crimson swimming in the even lanes and the Big Red in the odd, the meet began with the 200 medley relay. Harvard’s A relay, which consisted of senior Kristina Li, junior Meagan Popp, and sophomores Mei Lynn Colby and Mikaela Dahlke, led immediately from the start and never looked back, breezing to a comfortable victory in 1:44.55. The Crimson’s B relay almost took second, finishing after Cornell’s A relay by less than a second.
In the 1000 free, a true test of endurance, freshman Michelle Owens jumped to an immediate lead, and was paced by the Big Red’s Annaklara Doel. However, with strong strokes and turns, Owens was able to clock an impressive time of 10:18.76, with Doel finishing in 10:21.60.
The 200 free got off to a roaring start, with all swimmers finishing their first 50 within 1.5 seconds of each other. At the hundred, three Harvard swimmers vied for the top place; ultimately junior Sonia Wang edged the competition out, touching the wall in 1:53.52.
In the 100 back, with long and efficient strokes, Colby seemed to almost coast to a first place finish; she finished with a time of 56.26, followed closely by Li in 56.57.
In the 100 breaststroke, freshman Ingrid Wall established herself as the leader early in the sprint, and finished in 1:03.62. Freshman Allie Russell outpaced the rest of the field with a 1:05.62.
In the 200 fly, the tough intermediate between sprint and long distance, only two Crimson swimmers raced. That proved enough, as junior Claire Pinson looked comfortable throughout the race, maintaining her form and easily extending her lead in the last 50 to win in 2:07.39.
The 50 freestyle, perhaps one of the most thrilling races of the meet, saw Harvard take the first two places, as Dahlke and freshman Kennidy Quist took first and second place, with times of 23.82 and 24.21, respectively.
By the three meter diving break, the Crimson had yet to concede a race to their Cornell opponents. In three meter diving, Harvard took the top four places, led by junior Mikaela Thompson with a score of 310.88. Thompson also emerged victorious in one meter diving with a score of 261.08.
“Diving went really well,” Thompson said. “For diving, you have to really focus on doing what you practice. You don’t want to change too much in the meet because it’s really about consistency, so I think that’s really good. There are a lot of changes that we’re all working on making in our diving, so I think we were able to emphasize those corrections and also still dive pretty well, especially since we’re familiar with the pool and this atmosphere, having our families here and our friends come watch us and give us that extra motivation to really dive well.”
At the end of the break, the 100 freestyle saw Quist and sophomore Jerrica Li blow past the rest of the competition, finishing with times of 51.74 and 51.92, respectively, to finish two seconds ahead of the next finisher.
In the 200 backstroke, sophomore Matti Harrison and the Big Red’s Helen Hsu were stroke-for-stroke for most of the race. It appeared that Hsu would edge out Harrison, but a late surge by the latter in the final length gave her the win by 0.25 seconds in a time of 2:03.63. Korawski said that the team has focused on out-touching opponents in practice.
“We focus on racing all the time,” Korawski said. “We focus on being fearless and taking risks. So part of it is that you don’t want to make your move too late, and if you make it early and it doesn’t work, I’d rather see that now, but I want them to make a move and go for it. So we talk about, it’s not just about the times. That’s just an end result. It’s about what you can do in the race, what process you’re going to have to beat someone. So it comes back to that strategy. So we focus on beating each other in practice and now this is the opportunity to put those skills to the test in a close race to see if we can come out on top.
The Crimson continued its dominance in the 200 breaststroke, sweeping the top three places with a trio of  Popp, Russell, and Wall finishing within a four second spread.
The 500 freestyle featured the return Owens, who had earlier won the 1000 freestyle. Owens showed no fatigue as she got to a quick start, blazing through her first 200 in 1:59.00. Owens finished with a time of 5:01.90 and freshman Annabelle Paterson out-touched the Bear’s Sophia Cherkez in 5:04.45.
In the 100 fly, Dahlke and junior Brittany Usinger dueled it out, with Dahlke edging out her teammate by a second with a time of 55.26.
“I think what really helps our team be successful is that we really stress having a positive attitude and being their for one another,” Usinger said. “None of us are here to compete just for ourselves. We’re here to compete for the team. It’s always exciting to be working as an individual for the bigger goal, which is the end of the season, just sticking to the process. So I think for our team, what’s special is that we’re all here for each other and that’s why the sport is so fun because we get to be there for each other.”
After the one meter diving break, the meet resumed with the 200 individual medley. Again, Harvard jumped to a fast start, with four swimmers from the Crimson ahead after the first hundred. Senior Geordie Enoch and Popp duked it out for the top spot, with Enoch winning in a time of 2:05.46, followed by Popp, junior Valerie Yoshimura and Pinson.
The final 400 freestyle relay event, raced as an exhibition event, featured four Harvard relays against three of Cornell’s. The A relays were less than a body length apart for the entire contest. However, Li extended the Crimson’s lead at the end, giving her relay the victory in 3:28.85.
“We are excited not because of necessarily dominant performances, but mostly because how they’re swimming and diving. They’re executing their strategies well, and for us, that is the most important,” Morawski said. “So, they’re doing a really good job, some in best events, some in off events, some on new dives, some on dives they’ve done before, but executing everyday, in and out of practice, what they need to work on to be successful at the end of the season. At the competitions, it’s reinforces that we’re going in the right direction, so that’s what I’m the most pleased about right now.”
With two impressive wins under its belt, the team looks to show their prowess at large invitationals in the coming weeks.
“I just looking forward to having fun in practice and then carrying that fun into the rest of the meets of the season,” Usinger said. “We obviously take it one meet at a time, one day at a time, and just carrying the fun into the end of the season, so it should be good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team took the court at the Malkin Athletic Center with an opportunity to turn a good season into a great one. With just two matches left in the 2017-18 season, the Crimson was still mathematically alive in the hunt for the Ivy League title behind Princeton and Yale.
To earn a share of the title, though, the Crimson had needed to both 1) go 2-0 against Princeton and Penn and 2) hope that the Tigers and Bulldogs went 0-4.
In the Friday night kickoff against league-leader Princeton, however, Harvard (13-10, 8-6 Ivy League) ultimately fell to the Tigers (17-7, 10-4), by a final of three close sets to zero, 25-20, 25-22, and 25-22.
After being eliminated from Ivy League championship contention, the home team ended the season on a positive note, however, defeating Penn (12-11, 7-7) less than 24 hours later on the same court. The Crimson’s last chance to impress its home fans on senior night thus ended in a victory.
“Senior night is like the culmination of our four years here, and it represents all of the teams we’ve played on throughout our time here,” senior outside hitter Paige Kebe said. “It’s just a really special night for the team to celebrate the seniors and everything we’ve given to the program, and for us to kind of put it in their hands now, and pass it on.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 1
For the final match of the season, almost twice as many spectators filled the MAC than had on the previous night, with Penn boasting a large and vocal fanbase. At times, the Quakers’ fans and bench seemed to be making more noise than the Harvard supporters, even when the home team was in steady control of the game. The noise ultimately didn’t faze the home team, however, as Harvard outlasted the visitors for a victory in four sets.
The Crimson dropped the first set, 25-15, but took the next three, 25-22, 26-24, and 25-20 to win the game in style.
It was not all smooth sailing, as Penn appeared to be the more settled team at the beginning of the game. The Quakers jumped out to an 11-4 lead in the first set as Harvard struggled to land its shots—in the first set alone, the home team finished with a .176 hitting percentage compared to Penn’s .393. It looked as if the Crimson seniors were going to end their season with a thud, rather than a bang.
Rallying together, however, Harvard improved greatly over the next three sets, with each looking better than the previous. The Crimson hit more and more effectively—the home team finished with a .429 hitting percentage in the fourth, compared to Penn’s .175.
In the second set, Harvard jumped out to a 10-5 lead and held on from there to tie the match at one set apiece. Gaining steam from the set win, the Crimson led almost wire-to-wire in the second and third sets, looking like the much better team in the process.
Sophomore blocker Maclaine Fields led Harvard on offense, recording 14 kills on the night, while captain Christina Cornelius had another all-around impressive performance, clocking in 13 kills, two aces, and three blocks.
All told, four Crimson players tallied double-digit kill totals, and Harvard as a team finished with a .271 kill percentage.
The team’s two seniors, Kebe and defensive specialist Heather Sigurdson, had strong showings in their last appearances in a Crimson jersey. Kebe recorded 12 kills, while Sigurdson played her second straight game with 10 digs.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard had a good showing against the eventual conference co-champions, scoring 20, 22, and 22 points respectively in the game’s three sets. Though Princeton eventually wore the home team down in every set, the stats were relatively even across the board.
In terms of kills, the Crimson had 46 to the Tigers’ 49, and the two team’s hitting percentages were similar, with Harvard finishing with a team percentage of .270 compared to Princeton’s .300.
Freshman hitter Sandra Zeng and Sigurdson both had strong defensive performances, pulling out ten digs apiece in the hotly-contested matchup. Cornelius led the Crimson offensively, finishing the game with 13 kills, one of her best tallies of the season.
The team had trouble dealing with Princeton sophomore hitter Maggie O’Connell, who posted 18 kills on the evening.
Fields and junior blocker Jocelyn Meyer tallied nine kills each for Harvard.
Although they fell short of the Ivy League title this year, the Crimson has a lot to look forward to for next season. It only lost two seniors and finished third in the Ancient Eight standings. Cornelius returns to lead a youthful team next year, one which will consist of just four seniors.
“We’re a young team full of young superstars really,” Sigurdson said. “I have confidence that everyone is going to develop and grow further next year, and hopefully, it’s going to lead the team into a really awesome spot.”
The Crimson’s 8-6 third-place finish in the Ivy League was an improvement on last year’s fourth-place finish at 7-7, though the team has yet to reproduce the 2015 season, when Harvard went 10-4 in conference play and tied with Princeton atop the league.
After defeating the Crimson, Princeton went on to tie with Yale for the Ivy crown. The championship is Princeton’s third title or tied-for title in a row.
The Tigers and Bulldogs will play in a playoff to determine the Ivy League’s NCAA representative on Saturday, Nov. 18.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend’s sub-freezing temperatures and gusting winds may have signaled the first signs of autumn’s imminent surrender to the Boston winter. But for Harvard’s men’s and women’s crew teams, the weather wasn’t the only thing closing out the fall. This weekend’s Foot of the Charles Regatta marked the conclusion of the season for both teams.
A sense of home field advantage was on the side of the Crimson, as the familiar course proved to yield favorable results. Overall, Harvard secured two first place finishes in the varsity eight events— one by the men’s heavyweight and one by the women’s heavyweight team.
“[Radcliffe’s heavyweight] dominated the field, with our first and second varsity eights finishing first and third, respectively,” said junior heavyweight rower Erica Holmes. “We had a couple of injuries and uncertainty leading up to the event, but it's a testament to the team's resilience that we can produce strong results even in the face of adversity— and the Foot is always a fun opportunity to prove we are the fastest women's program on the Charles.”
With strong finishes at the season’s final race, the Harvard and Radcliffe programs will look to leverage the gained momentum and experience of the fall heading into the spring.
“We always learn a lot during our head races in the fall,” said junior heavyweight rower Rafaela Stalph. “Because these races are longer than our two kilometer races in the spring, having a strong fitness base is super important. We use this time to build up our endurance and base fitness levels, which provides us with the foundations we need for higher intensity training and racing in the spring season.”
WOMEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
Because the Foot of the Charles does not divide races between heavyweight and lightweight, the Harvard-Radcliffe program entered boats from both teams in the women’s varsity eight event.
The Black and White topped the event, as the Radcliffe A boat finished in first place with an elapsed time of 20.26.2. The Crimson boat won the event by a relatively comfortable margin, with the next closest boat from Northeastern posting a time of 20.48.9. Claiming the third place spot was the Radcliffe B boat, which rowed a time of 21.01.7. The final heavyweight boat, Radcliffe C, finished 14th overall.
“I think the team performed really well today, and showed big improvements from last year,” said junior heavyweight rower Sophia Young. “Not only did our 1v win, but our 2v had an especially strong race, beating all of the other boats in their category, and beating almost all of the other A boats as well.”
The heavyweight team also entered a boat in the women’s N8+ event. Harvard placed third, finishing behind the first place Boston College boat and just under a minute behind the second place boat from Boston University with a time of 14.50.7.
“Overall, we had a good performance at Foot of the Charles,” Stalph said. “We have made improvements physically and technically since Head of the Charles and will be striving to continue improving over the winter before spring racing.”
Coming off a bronze performance in the varsity eight at the Head of the Charles, the Black and White lightweight boats finished seventh and 14th in Saturday’s event. Among the light lightweight boats in the event, the Radcliffe lightweight A boat placed second behind Boston University with an elapsed time of 21.34.3.
With the fall season now in the books, the attention of Harvard-Radcliffe program is now turned toward the spring season.
“It's actually been a very promising fall season,” said Holmes, reflecting on the heavyweight team. “Comparing results from last fall to this fall, we have significantly closed the gap between ourselves and leading programs. If we can carry this trajectory into the spring, we will have one of our most successful seasons.”
“Between the results from Head of the Charles and Foot of the Charles, we have pretty solid evidence that, as an entire team, we are on a good track to success— not just in the spring coming up, but also for the years to come,” said freshman heavyweight rower Eliza Kallfelz. “We have a lot more work to do to get us where we want to be, but our rate of improvement between this fall and last fall is exciting to see.”
MEN'S HEAVYWEIGHT AND LIGHTWEIGHT
The Foot of the Charles also proved to be an impressive performance for the Crimson on the men’s side, for both the heavyweight and lightweight teams.
Harvard dominated its field of competition in the eight plus event, with the first heavyweight boat taking first place with a time of 12.17.2  and the first lightweight boat taking third place, just a second behind Northeastern’s heavyweight A boat.
In the four plus event, the Crimson heavyweight also landed amongst the top finishers. Harvard’s A boat edged out Northeastern’s first boat by three second to secure second place in the event. The Crimson finished just two seconds behind Brown, who won the event with a time of 13.11.2.
The men’s heavyweight and lightweight teams will return to the water in April, following a winter of training and an encouraging conclusion to the fall season at The Foot of the Charles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball’s 2016-17 season ended when the team failed to record a win in the Ivy League Tournament. In this year’s Maine Tip-Off Tournament, the Crimson saw similar results.
Last Friday night, Harvard (0-2, 0-0 Ivy League) opened the 2017-18 campaign with a loss to Dayton in the Maine Tip-Off Tournament. On Saturday, the Crimson fell again, this time to Maine.
“We were really excited going into this weekend,” junior guard Nani Redford said. “We were playing in a tournament with three great teams.”
MAINE 76, HARVARD 51
In the second game of the tournament, Harvard took an early 8-3 lead over the Black Bears (1-1, 0-0 America East). However, Maine went on an impressive 14-point run to take the lead for good. By the end of the first quarter, the Black Bears had already netted three three-pointers.
“They shot out of their minds,” Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Although Harvard was able to draw free throws, attempting 23 on the night, the Black Bears’ stifling defense held the Crimson to only 23.7 percent from the field. Junior guard Madeline Raster was the only Harvard player able to put up double digit points, finishing with 10 points.
In a back-and-forth second quarter, offense reigned. The Crimson shot 47.1 percent from the field, outdone by Maine’s 66.7 shooting percentage both inside and outside the arc. Although the Black Bears edged Harvard by only two points in the exciting quarter, Maine took the lead into the half, 42-33.
“We just didn’t play our game and allowed their momentum swings to take over,” Redford said.
The Black Bears regained its momentum from the first quarter, starting off the second half on a nine-point run, stretching its lead to 18 points. Maine would not look back.
The Crimson’s offense sputtered in the third quarter, making only one field goal the entire period. As a result, the team posted a field goal percentage of 5.6 percent in the quarter and scored seven points
The final quarter was much of the same, with the Crimson shooting only 20 percent from the field. Maine would add too its lead, resulting in a final score of 76-51.
DAYTON 72, HARVARD 66
The Crimson’s season opener was spoiled by the Flyers (2-0, 0-0 Atlantic 10) in a night characterized by free throws and streaky scoring.
The free throw line proved the difference maker, as neither team was able to effectively capitalize on its opportunities. Dayton shot only 60 percent from the line, while Harvard made 52.4 percent of its free throws.
“We played pretty well against Dayton, which was the strongest team, but couldn’t put the ball in the basket,” Delaney-Smith said.
Senior guard Taylor Rooks and sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm each nabbed the Crimson’s first double-doubles of the year. Boehm scored 11 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, while Rooks had 13 points and 13 rebounds.
Rooks started hot, scoring seven of the Crimson’s 12 first quarter points. The Flyers responded to Harvard’s early 10-5 lead by finishing the first quarter on a 13-2 run.
“We didn’t come out as strong as we wanted to,” Redford said.
The second quarter was a tug-of-war, with Dayton only able to extend its lead by two points as the teams went into the half with a 35-27 Flyers lead.
The Crimson had four players with double-digit point totals. In addition to Rooks’ and Boehm’s double-doubles, Raster scored 10 points and sophomore guard Katie Benzan led the team with 16 points.
In the third quarter, Harvard was unable to string together enough points to retake the lead. The Crimson would chip away at the lead multiple times, even coming within two points, but Dayton pulled away before Harvard could snatch control of the game.
The final quarter was a back-and-forth that echoed the previous three periods. A three-minute scoring drought in the middle of the quarter saw neither team notch a basket as the clock ticked down.
The Flyers kept their cushion for most of the fourth quarter, holding off Harvard in the end by a score of 72-66.
“I think the biggest takeaway is we have a lot of potential and we’re very talented, but we have a lot to learn,” Redford said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first home double-header of the season, the Harvard women’s hockey team faced off against Ivy League opponents Brown and Yale. The Crimson came off a two-week break ready to jump further into Ivy play and looked to gain a foothold in the ECAC against two sub-.500 teams.
But the time off was not without its unfortunate developments: the team lost tri-captain and top-line center Lexie Laing to injury, and later learned she would be out for the rest of the season.
Nevertheless, Harvard (3-1-1, 3-1-1 ECAC) rallied to pick up three of four available points through the weekend.
Against Brown (1-7, 1-5), nine different Crimson players tallied points in a 6-3 triumph—but the contest was closer than the score suggests, as the Bears trimmed down a 5-0 deficit in the last eight minutes of the game. That same third-period slowness caught up to Harvard against Yale (2-4-2, 1-3-2), when the Bulldogs erased the Crimson’s 2-0 lead for a 2-2 tie that overtime could not decide.
“We obviously were looking for two wins,” tri-captain Haley Mullins said. “We never want to tie or lose to an Ivy League team, but we’re a young team.”
HARVARD 2, YALE 2
In Saturday’s afternoon matchup, the Crimson played host to Ivy rivals, the Bulldogs. Yale had opened its Ivy League play the day before and emerged with a 5-1 win over Dartmouth.
While Harvard was having a strong second period on Friday against Brown, so were the Bulldogs in their own contest—two of their goals came during the middle frame against the Big Green. Though Yale’s record was less than stellar coming into Cambridge, it still brought an explosive offense up against the Crimson.
“Yale’s not going to go away,” said head coach Katey Stone. “It’s a great matchup, and I thought their goaltender did a great job [too].”
The visitors’ opportunistic, quick-strike offense was what made Harvard pay for sitting back on a two-goal lead late in the second period.
At 16:42 of the middle frame, Yale senior forward Eden Murray controlled a faceoff in the Crimson’s zone and fed her freshman linemate, Greta Skarzynski, in the slot. Skarzynski worked past the Harvard player marking her and chopped the biscuit between Crimson sophomore netminder Beth Larcom’s pads. The play underwent a long review, but was ultimately ruled a goal, cutting Harvard’s lead in half.
Later, with just one minute to play in the game, Yale junior forward Emma Vlasic crept into the high slot and fired the puck at the goal; Larcom was screened and never had a chance. Tied 2-2, the game would go to overtime.
“We had command of a large part of the game, in many different areas,” Stone said. “We let it slip away a little bit at the end there.”
Earlier, the Crimson got out to a lead by putting on a sharp power play late in the first frame, keeping up near-continuous play to tire out Yale’s penalty killers. Just as the penalty was expiring, Harvard sophomore defender Ali Peper fed sophomore Val Turgeon right across the crease—the east-west play allowed Turgeon to find the open net for the 1-0 lead. Turgeon’s goal also played spoilsport to the Bulldogs’ impressive penalty kill, good for third in the nation before the game began.
The opportunities continued for Harvard to start the second, mostly because of the aggressive, fast play of its top two forward lines. On a rare fourth-line shift, though, senior forward Dani Krzyszczyk stole the puck from a Bulldog defender deep in Yale’s zone, peeled away to the slot, and went flat and far-side past Hofmann, putting the Crimson up 2-0.
Overtime began at a thrilling up-and-down pace, but no much in terms of scoring chances. Harvard registered no official shots on goal in the extra five minutes—the closest opportunity was a snipe from freshman forward Becca Gilmore that got the glass. The Bulldogs tested Larcom twice, but to no avail. The final score was 2-2.
“We need to have that energy until the last minute of the last period of the weekend,” tri-captain Haley Mullins said. “But we’re not worried. We know it’s early in the season.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 3
On Friday evening, the Bears opened their Ivy League season against the Crimson at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Brown has been a struggling team thus far, as it has lost by three goals or more in all but two of its contests, including Friday’s matchup.
The first period proceeded with up-and-down play. The Crimson’s discipline woes continued, as it took three penalties through the opening 20. But the Bears were unable to capitalize on those advantages, including a 5-on-3. Despite Harvard’s productive power play, which ranked fourth in the nation coming into play, the Crimson too could not find the net in their time with the man advantage. The closest attempt for the visiting team built off a 2-on-1, with Larcom making a save with the shaft of her stick amidst cheers from her bench. Both teams were scoreless after 20 minutes.
“I thought we were really slow starting,” Stone said. “We didn’t have any sort of rhythm in the first period at all.”
It took the Crimson just three and a half minutes into the second frame to find that rhythm. A scramble in front of Brown sophomore netminder Calla Isaac resulted in Harvard junior forward Bradley Fusco shoving the puck past the goal line. Fusco’s first tally of the season gave the team a 1-0 lead, and was assisted by Gilmore and sophomore Kat Hughes.
From then on, the Crimson virtually set up shop in the Bears’ blue paint, playing in the offensive zone even while on the penalty kill. Harvard’s aggressive attack eventually paid off again 11 minutes into the second. Circling around the left wall, junior Kaitlin Tse passed to Turgeon at the near corner of the left circle. Turgeon was all alone, and slotted a fast shot past Isaac, short-side, to put the Crimson up, 2-0. Harvard stayed on top to finish the period up by two.
The score did not stay that way for long.
Early in the second, two Crimson freshmen stepped up—Keely Moy swooped down the right wing all alone, dangled in the slot, and beat Isaac high glove four minutes into the frame. Less than a minute after her, Brooke Jovanovich fished the puck of out a net-mouth scramble and and tucked it away to give Harvard a 4-0 lead. T
he shots kept coming for the Crimson, and so did the goals for Jovanovich, who fired a shot past an already-down Isaac into a wide-open net five minutes later. Though the tally was reviewed for goaltender interference, the call on the ice stood. Jovanovich’s first multi-goal outing put Harvard up 5-0.
The game could conceivably have ended with that score, with Larcom picking up a well-deserved shutout. But the Bears did not sit back, matching the Crimson shot for shot, and, most importantly, capitalizing on Harvard’s mistakes.
Brown notched three quick goals in less than four minutes to bring the count to 5-3. One was off a confusion in front of the net with Crimson defender Emma Buckles partially screening Larcom, and two were on separate two-player advantages. The game saw 13 penalties altogether, some of which Stone believes were “tough calls”—particularly those late in the third that led to the Bears’ partial comeback.
“You can’t call everything,” Stone said. “[But] we exacerbated it with another penalty—then you’re back in a 5-on-3. That’s definitely an area of concern.”
To its credit, though, the Crimson was able to wrest back momentum after the setback. The final nail in the coffin for Brown was a high-glove wrister from the right circle by Mullins.
“It was great to have us come right back and score the sixth goal,” Stone said. “[Mullins] earned every bit of that tonight...she played her heart out. I was glad to see her put that cherry on the top of the cake.”

As the big game draws near, many students find themselves shocked by the need to actually buy tickets for a school sporting event. Even more shocking is the price: $25 to sit in a freezing cold bowl and scream with other students for three hours. For those of you skeptical of this pricing scheme, Flyby has compiled a list of alternative ways to spend your $25, should you decide that the H-Y game simply isn’t worth it.
An Infinite Number of Regular Football Tickets
Seriously. Most Harvard students have to be dragged to regular home games (if they even know they’re happening), and these games are free. Yet we flock to the opportunity to buy $25 tickets to a game that forces us to travel to New Haven? Hmmm…
Three Feathers of a Canada Goose Jacket
The weather’s taken a turn for the cold in the last few days, leading many to realize that they’re not quite as prepared for winter as they thought. If the thought of owning a lusciously warm, exorbitantly-priced Canada Goose Jacket makes your heart skip a beat, good luck—you had better start saving now.
650 Feet of Bubble Wrap
What better way to start prepping for finals than distracting yourself with 650 feet of bubble wrap delivered straight to you? Do you need 650 feet of it? Yes my friend, yes you do.
Two Entire Clover Meatball Subs
If you’ve been secretly wanting to try Clover’s meatless meatball subs, now is your chance, but since they are almost $13 each, you can only buy two. Is it a better way to spend your $25? Probably not, but hopefully they’ll at least be tasty.
Go forth. Spend your $25. Cast your vote on the most worthy cause. Be it an experience, a meal, or the endless annoyance of your roommates, it will most certainly be more worth it than a certain sporting event in New Haven.

Harvard’s UC presidential election is about to reach its epic conclusion, at least for the people who know that it’s happening. The Crimson Crossfire debate took place in Harvard Hall on Sunday, and it was filled with great debate points, inquisitive questions, and circular reasoning. So for the majority of us who didn’t attend this event, what should we take away from it?
Finger snapping orgy
We get it, finger-snapping is the new way to clap, but hearing more snaps than direct replies from the candidates does get dreary. It’s comforting to know that a lot of the student body responds positively (read: by snapping) to “inclusive” and “together we can.”
Fund bragging
This isn’t your average high school election where candidates promise better school spirit and less homework. The different platforms proposed significant budget proposals and no-strings-attached funds going into hundreds of thousands of dollars. Let’s hope we can see the effect the big bucks have, eh?
Blame everything on the UC exec
When asked about certain controversies involving the UC and its relationship with the Harvard administration, the exec was mercilessly scapegoated. Failure of true integration of the Harvard community? Blame the exec. Appeals to the administration about issues that don’t represent the student body? Ditto. We would not want to be this person.
Resources
If PBHA’s Mission Hill After School program got a dollar every time this word was used, HCCG would be suing the administration for disportionate allocation of club funds. Seriously, this word should be banned during debates.
“I voted against it, but I certainly support this progressive initiative”
The statement says it all.
