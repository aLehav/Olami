After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An important backstory is purposefully absent for most of the screentime in “mother!” (stylized with a lowercase m). Without explanation, a series of visitors show up in front of the house of Jennifer Lawrence (referred to as “mother”) and Xavier Bardem (referred to as “Him”). The already uncomfortable relationship between the couple is exacerbated as Lawrence tries to voice her concerns to her husband, a successful poet, only to find out that he is incredibly generous towards these strangers. He not only allows them to stay, but also hosts someone’s funeral reception in their very home. Tension begins to consume the home with the growing presence of the visitors, and the film culminates in overwhelming turmoil.
This is not a story that makes a lot of sense, and the director probably doesn’t want it to. From the beginning, it is full of chaos and confusion, and none of the characters act in comprehensible ways—except Lawrence’s character, who for most of the film is attempting in vain to understand what is going on. Her role encapsulates the term “surrogate character” in the sense that she is the only person the audience could possibly identify with, and the horror of the film comes from the fact that everything else is uncertain. Director Darren Aronofsky uses close-ups throughout the film to stay close to Lawrence; the audience becomes a shadow of the character by watching unexpected scenes unfold right beside her. The camerawork also helps the viewer empathize with her feelings of insignificance. In one scene, she bends down to collect the pieces of a broken glass, and the camera recedes from her and then lifts up, making Lawrence seem smaller and emphasizing her insecurity.
Aronofsky complicates the situation by linking the “normality-absurdity” dynamics in the story and the gender dynamics between the protagonists. Disoriented in her own house, Lawrence also loses her agency in shaping it the way she wants. By contrasts, Bardem’s character is not only the root of all the mysteries, but also completely in control. He undermines Lawrence by repeatedly forgiving the visitors’ actions without consulting her and depriving her of the right to know his agenda. The superiority of his character is also suggested in other aspects of the film: the name of Lawrence’s character is lowercased in the title as well as in the credits, while Bardem’s character appears in the credits with a capitalized name. The film’s depiction of gender relationships is so provocative that the viewers might question the director’s personal beliefs, unless they think that Bardem’s character is so ridiculous that it has to be a satire.
As the film progressed, the viewer could realize that the root of all the absurdities is religious fanaticism. The spiritual status of Bardem’s character is made clear through the escalating devotion from visitors. Celebrators, cult-like followers, activists, paparazzi, and militants make their way into the home in reaction to Bardem’s writing, to the extent that a war actually waged in the living room in one scene. A majority of these visitors then turn violent as various groups fight for space in the house. The horrified mother tries to adapt and understand the chaos that has become her home, as she witnesses strangers shove, shout, imprison, attack, and murder one another in almost every room while the story moves towards the consuming conclusion.
To reiterate, “mother!” intentionally begins without solidity so that the viewer lives with and builds fear alongside Lawrence’s character. One may watch the beginning of the film and assume that it is about a home invasion or a haunted house. The core of the story emerges much later, and the viewer might not be ready for it.

Browsing through my Netflix account, I stumbled upon a movie that I had not watched in a decade: Martin Scorsese’s epic 2002 film “Gangs of New York.” This two-and-a-half-hour tale of violence, revenge, betrayal, and friendship features Hollywood heavyweights Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis.
Scorsese’s semi-historically accurate story revolves around Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), a young man in 1860s Manhattan. After being released from an orphanage, Amsterdam seeks to avenge the death of his father, the former leader of a gang of Irish immigrants. However, his father’s killer, Bill “The Butcher” Cutting (Day-Lewis), has already established his gang of “true” Americans as the ruling force in Amsterdam’s childhood community—the notorious “Five Points.”
So much for the film’s premise. While it might seem like “Gangs of New York” is set up to be an ordinary, run-of-the-mill revenge action flick, things get a lot more complicated and interesting. In fact, Amsterdam is far too successful in his efforts to get closer to the Butcher who, not recognizing him, takes him in as his apprentice and starts to regard him as his son. Amsterdam shares at least some of the Butcher’s feelings, stating that “It's a funny feeling being taken under the wing of a dragon. It's warmer than you'd think.”
This curious relationship makes Scorsese’s film so absorbing: It creates moments of intense suspense, confusing affection, and pure rage, both for the viewer and for the protagonists. Undoubtedly, it takes two very talented actors to form such a relationship on screen—and Daniel Day-Lewis especially excels in it. The only male to win three best-actor Oscars, he received another best-actor nomination for his role as the Butcher. His portrayal of a man who is rational but violent, empathetic but merciless, sometimes principled but sometimes opportunistic, is convincing through and through. Day-Lewis has created a three-dimensional character on a two-dimensional screen, one that touched me deeply with its humanity, one that stayed with me for a decade after the film was over.
Looking back, however, that is not all that there is to love about “Gangs of New York.” It is also one of the last large-scale blockbuster films that was produced without CGI (except for one very short scene where no elephant was available to run wild in the Five Points). In this lies much of its beauty: The Five Points is an actual set. Every facade, every street is real. So are explosions and muzzle flashes and cannon fire—blood that splatters actually splatters. The fact that “Gangs of New York” is self-contained—in the sense that what the camera sees is what the viewer sees—gives it an aura of cinematic craftsmanship.
Scorsese has created a homage to New York City that is full of iconic (a Bible sinking into the water) and ironic (soldiers boarding while caskets are coming off a ship) imagery. “Gangs of New York” also deals with ever-present topics such as poverty, class divisions, and racism. The film is nothing short of awe-inspiring.

Decked out in all pink (cowboy hat included), Stefani Germanotta—better known by her stage name Lady Gaga—is back. With five albums under her belt, the pop icon has plenty to say and is eager to share in the new Netflix documentary “Gaga: Five Foot Two.” An in-depth look at the performer’s trials and tribulations over the past year, the film presents a Gaga adjusting to new challenges and substituting drama for authenticity.
Stripping away the spectacle, the documentary offers viewers a strikingly candid glimpse of Gaga out of the limelight. It does not shy away from difficult moments, chronicling scenes of the performer battling deep pains: fibromyalgia, heartbreak, and her friend’s illness, to name a few. Gaga’s own commentary takes on a confessional tone. She sits on a curb, hair undone, and reflects on criticism and the music industry with unexpected honesty. A far cry from the mysterious, egg-palanquin enigma of the early 2010s, this unfiltered, ripped-shorts performer is nonetheless refreshing and acutely engaging.
The film succeeds also in providing fans an intimate look at her values. When Gaga posits that “[her] family is the most important thing in [her] life,” she means it: Clips of her at a christening and her grandmother’s home reveal her tethering points amid all of the turmoil. And this new Gaga, several years removed from her last album, has cultivated valuable introspection. She says that the unpredictable “old-Gaga” came from a need to “put some absurd spin on [her art] that made [her] feel like [she] was still in control.” This re-characterizes Gaga not as a wild card, but instead as a woman cognizant of the power structures around her and deeply intentional in her responses to them.
And yet, for all the piece does to rough up her veneer, there exists some disconnect between the Gaga she sees and presents. At one point, she previews her song “Joanne,” a heartbreaking tribute to her late aunt. This is a clear emotional high point of the documentary and deeply personal for the Germanotta family, but there is something discomfiting about the scene: For viewers so accustomed to Gaga’s performance art, observing this emotional vulnerability feels uncomfortably voyeuristic. This transition to sentimentality has been particularly difficult for her old fans, with whom the performer says she has trouble connecting.
Indeed, there are moments when the documentary becomes quite heavy-handed. During one late night photoshoot, Gaga reminisces on the state of her work-life balance, confessing that “I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence” as she wades into in a dark, empty pool. The opening and closing scenes of the film lack subtlety. Preparing for her 2017 Super Bowl performance, a primed Gaga is slowly lifted into the air in a harness, to a hymn-like orchestration of “Kaval Sviri.” As artistically beautiful as they can be, these scenes muddy the water and raise the question of whether or not the old, theatrical Gaga is truly gone.
For anyone confused at how the same artist who performed “Paparazzi” at the 2009 VMAs could release a single like “Million Reasons,” “Five Foot Two” is the documentary to watch. Gaga is unapologetic. And although it is unclear whether she will manage to reconcile her early dramatics with this new, stripped-down persona, one can’t help but root for the larger-than-life performer in the pink cowboy hat.

It doesn’t matter what you say about bad acting, cliché plot lines, or creating an unrealistic image of high school and life beyond: “One Tree Hill” was a masterpiece of our youth. This series centers on two half-brothers who play basketball, but the show itself brings something to the table for both jocks and fans of rom-coms. With romance, literature, fashion, basketball, and music, “One Tree Hill” has something for everyone.
Characters become superstars in their own right. Over the course of the series, Haley and Peyton climb to the top of the music industry while Brooke is designing clothes for her successful “Clothes Before Bros” line. But the three of them always make it home in time to read their buddy Lucas’ new book and catch Nathan’s basketball game on TV. Is it likely that everyone in your high school friend group will be this successful in their careers? Probably not. Your buddy on the football team will more than likely not make it to the NFL, and your classmate who starred in all the school plays won’t be a Hollywood star. But there is something so fun about imagining a world where everyone achieves their loftiest dreams.
“One Tree Hill” also manages to pair up almost every possible couple among the five main characters. In fact, the only boy-girl match that doesn’t happen—Haley and Lucas—is only hampered by the facts that they had been best friends for years and that Haley gets married before she even graduated high school. Yes, Haley and Nathan somehow manage to get married and have a kid before they have a diploma. Despite all this, everything turns out okay in the end. “One Tree Hill” is an idealistic world where all five of them can sleep with each other and still remain good friends.
Throw in some kidnappings, parents with drug problems, and untimely deaths, and you have arrived in Tree Hill, North Carolina. To an early high schooler, “One Tree Hill” is what life could be like if they were more attractive, had more problems, and had prettier—and crazier—friends.
The greatest part is that the characters still become hugely successful despite their massive flaws. So of course young viewers feel the hope that they too can visit their celebrity friend’s mansion while working on their latest novel or fashion design. Myself included: I don’t wanna be anything other than a fan of “One Tree Hill.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year is 1973. Flare sleeves and bell bottoms are in. Nixon is president. And Billie Jean King has just defeated self-proclaimed male chauvinist Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes, an exhibition tennis match that represents a monumental triumph for women in the world of sports, and will, in 44 years, get a film adaptation in a world both very different and very similar.
It’s no small feat to turn a match with such a well-known outcome into fodder for a suspenseful, compelling movie, but Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (the directorial team behind “Little Miss Sunshine”) successfully flesh out the famous match’s complex backstory. Faced with staunch misogyny from high-ranking tennis executives, King (a broad-shouldered, hunched Emma Stone) founds the Virginia Slims Circuit with a troupe of fellow female tennis players helmed by Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman). Glaring at her news coverage, Riggs (a clownish Steve Carell with fake crooked teeth) is a retired Wimbledon champion with a gambling addiction that causes tension in his marriage with his exasperated wife, Priscilla (Elisabeth Shue). As women’s tennis gains traction, Riggs decides to challenge the best female player in the world. Things get more complicated when King, while preparing for the match, begins a love affair with her hairstylist, Marilyn Barnett (a captivating Andrea Riseborough, with blonde, Farrah Fawcett waves), neglecting her husband, Larry (Austin Stowell), who is distant but affectionate. But one gets the sense that for King, love is just a distraction; as Larry explains to Marilyn, “We’re just the sideshow. Tennis is her real love.” When King makes her entrance into the Houston Astrodome, it is clear just how much is at stake. It’s incredibly frustrating to watch her train rigorously while Riggs hams for the camera, to see that so much rides on this match for her, and so little for him. The audiences could feel it in every breath, every volley of the ball over the net: her fight is theirs, too.
It’s a heady time to make a movie in which an ambitious, hardworking, qualified woman beats an incompetent, publicity-grubbing man in the game she knows best. Each misogynist epithet lobbed at King and her teammates smacks viscerally of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign rhetoric—each time King is criticized for cracking under the pressure or derided for taking time off under the flu, every patronizing sportscaster, the leering exhortations to “stay in the kitchen.” King’s ultimate victory, her final volley, is symbolic of so much more, a kind of catharsis that spans the decades.
For all its road-paving, however, “Battle of the Sexes” tends to market feminism, rather than explore its complexities: It strives to be palatable, and in doing so, becomes reluctant to challenge some of the insidious, systemic factors at work. When Riggs asks, “You’re still a feminist, right?” King answers, “No, I’m a woman who happens to play tennis.” That brand of women’s rights feels remarkably tepid. Why, one might wonder, are they mutually exclusive?
The question of King’s feminism, though, rests on the unreasonable expectation for successful women to speak for their entire gender. Amelia Earhart was just a woman who happened to be a pilot. Marie Curie was just a woman who happened to be a scientist. Sally Ride was just a woman who happened to be an astronaut. Billie Jean King was “just” a female tennis player—but of course, her legacy and her place in cultural consciousness represent so much more.
For King, the “Battle of the Sexes” was a rigged game—one that is still being played today. It would take a cold heart not to feel the slightest bit empowered when King hoists her trophy into the air. It is a distant cultural memory, but a joyous one, a victory that feels like it belongs, in part, to all of us. After all, it’s a trying time to fight for women’s rights in 2017. Perhaps we’d like to return, at least for a moment, to 1973.

To say that Boston is a cultural center might be an understatement. Home to around 50 universities and collections of fine art, the city hosts institutions with missions of both education and expression. “The Museum, the City, and the University,” a panel discussion between local art museum directors, grappled with those ideas. Moderated by Harvard art history professor Yukio Lippit, the panel sought to explore how museums, universities, and cities come together to generate a broader sense of civic engagement.
The Sept. 25 talk featured five directors from Boston art museums: Peggy Fogelman of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Paul C. Ha of the MIT List Visual Arts Center, Jill Medvedow of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Martha Tedeschi of the Harvard Art Museums, and Matthew D. Teitelbaum of the Museum of Fine Arts.
Though diverse in experience and expertise, the five speakers have been united on some key issues. Earlier this year, the group signed a letter to the Trump administration defending the National Endowment for the Arts. Months later, they say that this feeling of urgency has remained strong: the panel often referenced the current social and political landscape as well as a larger attack on the arts.
The conversation began with a discussion of the museums in the larger context of metropolitan Boston. Considering the impact of physical space, Medvedow characterized her institution as one of many small breaks in a corporate urban landscape. In this vein, she said, the way we construct our limited living spaces reveals much about what we value.
Other speakers chose a more demographic lens through which to analyze their museums. Fogelman, commenting on the rapid development of Boston and its transformation of everyday life, honed in on the idea of sanctuary. In her eyes, museums in the city serve to provide much-needed repose in the high-stress, productivity-dominated culture we live in.
The speakers also emphasized the relationship between museum and viewer. Tedeschi, director at Harvard’s own art museums, was acutely aware of the need for these spaces to cater to the desires of their visitors. With students in mind, she said that there is no single way to experience or interact with art and that each visit must take into account the specific motives the visitor has for coming to the museum. In a city of diverse individuals living in the age of quick information, museums must provide audiences different options for interaction if they wish to create satisfactory experiences.
The speakers were not in agreement on all fronts, however. Teitelbaum, expanding on the relationship between museum and audience, shared his reservations with the idea of museums as simply protective. Deeming the position too passive in scope, he instead proposed the image of a museum as an open forum for approaching new ideas. “I think museums more urgently than in my experience need now to create enlightened citizens and create activity and action in our communities,” Teitelbaum said.
The statement is particularly fitting in the context of Radcliffe’s focus for this school year, which is the theme of citizenship. And indeed, the conversation always came back to the idea of civic engagement. Universities and museums are not meant to be insular institutions, according to the panelists. Rather, they must look outwards. As Ha said, “[The museum’s] duty is to present.”
Reflecting on the panel, moderator Lippit said, “The discussion was full of humor and insight, and left me feeling that our Boston-area cultural institutions, as remarkable as they are, are refusing to rest on their laurels.” He contends that the museums, esteemed as they are, remain constantly vigilant and constantly evolving. The talk as a whole drove home the point that these are living institutions, and the panelists claimed they both feed from and giving back to the communities they are a part of.
Upon conclusion of the event, Alison Moore, a Cambridge resident, said, “This talk made me want to get more involved.”
“The Museum, The City, and The University” explored the relationship between the three institutions and the role they play in forming civic identity. The panelists were in consensus that museums and universities play an integral role in Boston, mobilizing citizens to question, challenge, and engage.

From secretly writing songs on her bathroom floor to playing over 70 shows a year, opening for the likes of Alanis Morissette and Switchfoot, Brynn A. Elliott ’18 balances being a full-time pop musician with being a full-time Harvard student. A philosophy concentrator living in Currier House, Elliott meets with music producers and writes song lyrics when she’s not working on her thesis or going to office hours. On Oct. 23, Elliott, an inactive Crimson editor, will play her first headlining show at Brighton Music Hall. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Elliott to discuss how she juggles her double life as a student musician.
The Harvard Crimson: Have your academics influenced your songs?
Brynn A. Elliott: The first song I wrote was about “Anna Karenina,” so I've always had a very academic approach to songwriting. One of my two singles out now, “Might Not Like Me,” was inspired by a seminar that I took in the Philosophy Department, Philosophy 125: Descartes and His Critics, taught by one of my favorite professors, Alison Simmons. A lot of the class centered around Descartes’ women critics, and what it meant for them to write philosophy in a time that didn't consider them to be philosophers. No one would ever know that, because it just sounds like a female empowerment pop song about a breakup, but it's also about the bravery of these women. The other single is called “Psycho Stupid Crazy” and it's about the weirdness of social media and how we use it. It’s specifically about feeling like you’re psycho, stupid, and crazy for stalking your ex-boyfriend on Facebook, but realizing that you’re not, because everyone does it.
THC: How do you handle the pressures of being both a pop musician and a Harvard student?
BAE: I don’t think I escape the pressures. I thrive on them. When I feel the pressure of only having three more hours to write a paper, but also really needing to write a song, the lack of balance helps me produce better papers and better music. It’s not what I planned on doing, but I feel grateful to be able to do both at the same time. I’ve also felt a huge sense of support and encouragement from the faculty at Harvard. My professors from the Philosophy Department are so open to me traveling, and they’re so open to my story. The Arts and Humanities [Division] even hosted a show for me at the Queen’s Head.
THC: What parts of your Harvard experience have you had to sacrifice to produce music, and vice versa?
BAE: I sacrifice a lot of time with friends. For example, we were supposed to go apple picking on Saturday, but a music thing came up. Making those sacrifices has been really difficult, but luckily I have people in my life who understand. And sometimes I have to prioritize school because this space, especially because it’s my senior year, is very sacred to me, so it’s important to be present. Today, my manager was like, “I can set up five meetings for you today,” but I have a paper due at 5 p.m., so I’m only doing one or two.
THC: Who are your influences?
BAE: This isn’t a sonic thing, but Bono is really influential, in how he's married doing good work in the world with making good music. I’m not trying to compare myself to Bono, but he inspired me to work with Y2Y, a youth homeless shelter in Harvard Square. Proceeds from the October 23 show are going to Y2Y. Sonically, I’m inspired by Brandi Carlile and Ingrid Michaelson, and pop musicians like Lorde and Adele. Adele is the classiest pop act of all time. Powerful women who have strong voices in the music industry are really important to me.
THC: Why is the city of Boston so central to your identity as an artist?
BAE: I started writing songs in Boston because I came here in high school for Harvard Summer School. The first time I ever performed live in front of people was at a talent show for the summer school students in Sanders Theatre. That’s why I’m doing my first headline show here, because I’m really invested in this community, especially the artist community. Boston is so unique in that there’s so many different kinds of people here producing different kinds of things. Going to Nashville or other music towns is just me being around a lot of other musicians, so it’s like me around a lot of other me’s.
THC: What do you intend your audience to take away from your music?
BAE: You can write generic lyrics all day long, but my goal is to write pop music that is really meaningful, even if it’s simple. Katy Perry talks about purposeful pop—making pop music that sounds like the music that's in the club, but is actually talking about things we all think about and go through. That’s also why I study philosophy. The main thing I would want my audience to take away is a sense of hope or empowerment. I want my listeners to think, “Man, I'm lifted after listening to this,” or “I can go do this next thing in my life.” That's what music has done for me.

“Tonight is going to be an exercise in surmounting derision,” announced iconic musician and author Patti Smith, taking the stage at the Back Bay Events Center. On Sept. 28, Smith was slated to discuss her latest novel, “Devotion,” but she had come down with a particularly nasty cold. She assured the audience, which had welcomed her with a frenzied standing ovation, that while she could not read from the book, she could still sing with a headache. As for reading, she playfully suggested everyone give it a read themselves … the next time they’re having a bad day in the bathroom.
Gesturing to the black sunglasses on her face, Smith quipped, “I’m not trying to be cool, I don’t need dark glasses to be cool,” before diving into a captivating a cappella cover of the song “The End of the World” by Skeeter Davis, which she had recorded during the credits of Darren Aronofsky’s film “mother!” She paused for just a second, forgetting the words, but the audience filled her in without missing a beat. She transitioned effortlessly into praising the late author William Blake for his lifetime of hard work and unrecognized creative brilliance. “I know I’m appreciated, but I am often misunderstood … I wrote this little song to remind myself that William Blake had it a lot tougher,” she said, picking up her acoustic guitar as her daughter, Jesse Paris Smith, accompanied her on piano for a performance of her 2004 song, “In My Blakean Year.”
The event incorporated her book’s themes into a curated set list of some of her greatest songs. She described her novel as “a three dimensional exercise on the writing process … It speaks on the writing process, shows the writing process and the fruits of the writing process.” To illustrate these three levels in “Devotion,” she chose the song “Dancing Barefoot,” which she said was her written farewell to public life . The is a love letter to the people, to her late husband, Fred Sonic Smith, and to God. Smith’s voice, candid and reflective, quieted as she recalled her lifelong friendship with playwright Sam Shepard, who passed away this July. While not quite ready to talk about him extensively, she reminisced for a moment about their endless phone conversations on books, and his funny habit of always keeping a Samuel Beckett play nearby for comfort. For Shepard, she picked up her guitar and strummed the song “Beneath The Southern Cross,” whispering at its conclusion, “farewell Sam.”
Smith did not leave the audience on a sorrowful note, instead choosing to bring the entire hall together in a sing-along of her most famous song, “Because The Night.” The emotion and energy of the audience exploded into a cathartic group rendition of the chorus. After a second round of rambunctious applause, the floor was opened for a short question and answer session, in which audience questions prompted Smith to speak both on loss and on feeling lost. Tackling grief, Smith said, “In the center of any tragedy we have to hold onto all the different aspects that make us human.” On staying inspired in such politically troubling times, the musician replied, “That is exactly when you’re supposed to feel inspired.” Smith closed the night with another sing-along, this time an a capella rendition of Elvis Presley’s “Can’t Help Falling In Love.”
The audience, having erupted into one last standing ovation for Smith, left feeling hopeful and energized, chattering with one another in the lobby of the event center. Audience member Caroline A. Weeks said of the night, “I really like that I didn’t get what I expected.” The night that was supposed to be a talk had transformed into an impromptu show. “We got a concert!” Weeks exclaimed.
“I just like being in the same room as her, it feels warm,” said audience member Rose J. Nisotis of Smith’s performance.
She and her friend travelled from Connecticut to see the event, and found themselves particularly taken with Smith’s calming, often humorous tone and the cohesiveness of the audience. Her friend added, “We drove two hours to get here, and we made friends!”
Jessica A. Halem, a Cambridge resident, was more taken with Smith’s legacy, attitude, and influence on a generation of musicians and creators. “Punk rock is how we share our greatest voice,” she remarked. “Patti Smith reminds us to remain optimistic in difficult times.”

“Little Fires Everywhere” is a slow burn of a novel. Celeste Ng—author of the New York Times bestseller “Everything I Never Told You”—begins her second book with the literal combustion of the brewing racial and familial tensions in a sleepy Ohio town: “Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down.” From there, the novel dives into the past, tracing how a picturesque family, a nomadic artist, and a Chinese-American baby with an ever-changing name can start a fire.
Shaker Heights claims to be a model community of early 90s progressivism. At the town’s heart are the Richardsons, a white, picture-perfect family. The mother, Elena Richardson, is a small-town journalist with dreams bigger than her bylines. She and her husband have four children: Lexie (the popular high school senior), Trip (the charismatic junior), Moody (the soft-hearted sophomore), and Isabelle (also known as Izzy, the family’s rebellious, artistic misfit).
Enter the Warrens, a family of two. Mia Warren is a photographer who moves whenever she “gets the bug.” Her daughter, Pearl, has never had her own room before. Their arrival to Shaker Heights garners an obsession from their landlord—the Richardsons. Moody falls in love with Pearl, who becomes Lexie’s best friend and Trip’s secret girlfriend. Izzy hires herself as Mia’s unpaid apprentice, and Mrs. Richardson launches her own private investigation into Mia’s mysterious past, abusing her journalistic connections in the process.
This might sound like the grounds for a cheesy TV drama, but it isn’t. Characters that could easily fall into shallow tropes don’t. Ng is smarter than that. She has the deft hand of a science fiction writer, entrenching the novel with world- and character-building detail. Every now and then, she steps back to show her skill in seemingly tangential vignettes, like when she describes Izzy’s affinity for rebellion: “When they went to the pool, Lexie and Trip and Moody were allowed to splash in the shallow end, but Izzy—then age four—had to sit on a towel, coated in sunscreen and shaded by an umbrella. After a week of this, she jumped headfirst into the deep end and had to be rescued by the lifeguard.” But every line is a catalyst for the inevitable fire, thus forming a tight, coherent story within the book’s concentrated universe.
Ng devotes much of the novel’s time to tenderly and precisely fleshing out the motivations of the Richardsons and Warrens. However, because the bulk of “Little Fires Everywhere” revolves around these two families, Ng ends up glossing over the true conflict that ignites their idyllic little town—at least, the conflict that’s marketed as such on the book jacket. About 100 pages in, the Richardsons visit the McCulloughs, who are showing off their brand new one-year-old child—an adopted Chinese-American girl they’ve dubbed Mirabelle Rose McCullough. After several miscarriages, a baby is all Mrs. McCullough could have ever asked for, and it seems like their perfect lives are finally complete. That is, until Bebe Chow, Mirabelle’s—or May Ling’s—biological mother enters the picture, starting a custody battle that splits apart the town.
Theoretically, there could be more time spent on the emotional distress that comes with the question of heritage and ownership, the desperation of unfulfilled motherhood, and the power dynamics between a Chinese immigrant and a wealthy white woman. Ng does take a few chapters to explore these themes, but they are always firmly in the background of the Richardsons and the Warrens’ own discord. It’s unfortunate because it never feels like there are real stakes and crystallized characters in the custody battle, thus reducing a necessary dialogue to a plot device. It’s only disappointing if you were expecting the novel to be a full focus on racial prejudice and class privilege.
But that may not be what “Little Fires Everywhere” is trying to do, despite the marketing angle. Mia Warren’s backstory is still vivid and fascinating. The placid ignorance and “progressiveness” of Shaker Heights belies the town’s aggressive response to anyone who tries to disturb the peace. Mia’s and her daughter’s interactions with the McCulloughs definitely flare up with conflict much later in the novel, but the painstaking care Ng takes to set up the fire is nothing short of brilliant. “Little Fires Everywhere” may not be the book its plot summary suggests, but Shaker Heights and its residents are mapped out with intense sharpness, making this fully-imagined novel still worth the visit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playwright Jaclyn Backhaus settled into a chair at the front of the spacious room, leaning forward towards her audience in a manner that she later described as “fireside chat-style.” To her left were three Harvard College actors (Lindsay McAuliffe ’20, Meghan Onserio ’19, and Peryn Reeves-Darby ’18) who were later joined by Robin JaVonne Smith, a leading actor in Speakeasy Stage Company’s production of Backhaus’ play “Men On Boats.” Together they held scripts, waiting to act and read excerpts for the first time—despite the title, none of the actors were male, which was Backhaus’s intention.
On Sept. 27, SpeakEasy, Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, Harvard College Women's Center, Office for BGLTQ Student Life, and The Department of Theater, Dance & Media brought Backhaus to Farkas Hall to discuss her play and the process of writing it. In the fall of 2013, she began writing an adventure-comedy based on the historical voyage of John Wesley Powell and his crew upon the Colorado River. After hearing stories of Powell’s expedition (the first government-sanctioned exploration of the area), during her childhood in Arizona, as an adult she had stumbled upon his journals from the period and decided they were the perfect source material for a play.
Initially, she was most excited to experiment with adventure as a theatrical genre, and to meet the difficult task of replicating the desperation and adrenaline of survival tactics and action scenes onstage. At the same time, the nature of the voyage enabled her to indulge in her poetic side, writing beautiful, lyrical scenes that often incorporated direct quotes from Powell’s journals. Above all, she drew from her love for theater. “For me, what I do is I write from a place of delight, and of joy,” she said.
As the play progressed, however, she added another dimension. She realized that neither she nor anyone like her would ever be able to perform conventionally in the roles that she was writing—given the time period, every explorer was a white, cisgender male. However, any viewer of “Men On Boats” will not see one actor onstage matching this description: Backhaus included a casting note for the final production instructing the director to challenge this narrative by relying on a cast entirely of racially diverse, non-cisgender male-identifying individuals.
Backhaus described how she took into account the importance of conflicting narratives, of ideological clashes, and of authentic representation. “What better medium to find inclusivity than the medium of theater, when you’re working on a live experience that will be shared by a community?” she said
The casting note allows for different actors to bring unique perspectives to an otherwise homogenous character list. The actors are intended to represent a wide array of human experiences that enable them to reenact events centuries past with new relevance. “It’s just playing the truth of myself and for me, and I think for many of my castmates, that really freed things up,” said Smith, who plays John Wesley Powell in SpeakEasy’s production of the play.
At the end of the workshop, an audience member asked how true the play was to Powell’s original journals and what was added to cater to a modern audience. Laughing, Backhaus recalled how Powell had described in his journals a spat over his crew members’ poor hygiene. First and foremost, these explorers were human, and Backhaus’s task was to take those relatable parts and extend them through the full play. “For me, with this play, it was all about getting people in the room to hear it out loud, hear their thoughts on it, and hear where they find themselves in the play,” she said. “Because that’s what helped inform a lot of the context with which I was able to craft it and my ability to bring it into the world.”
“Men On Boats” runs through Oct. 7 at SpeakEasy.

From Lorde’s “Melodrama” to Taylor Swift’s “Reputation,” 2017 is shaping up to be quite the year of pop reinvention. Miley Cyrus, reeling from the excess of her “Dead Petz” era, is no exception to the trend. Her new album “Younger Now,” released on Sept. 29, is both foreign and familiar. In a sharp departure from her most recent work, Cyrus attempts to return to her country-pop roots in an act of artistic rebirth. Unfortunately, though “Younger Now” begins pleasantly enough, it lacks the thematic continuity necessary to establish the persona shift she seeks.
At first look, the album presents itself effectively. The title is evocative of a deep contradiction in this new Miley: To progress, she must embrace the regressive. Her cover art mirrors these sentiments. Plastered with bright, bubblegum colors framing Miley in leather greaser getup, the image is invitingly retro. It’s a thinly veiled rejection of her last two album cycles, and a marked pivot toward accessibility by the general public. Decked out in familiar apparel and referencing an older, more accepted Miley, the album presents the performer as someone we know—and perhaps even wish to get to know again.
“Younger Now” opens with its namesake, a strong start to the collection. The introduction, around 15 seconds of pure rain sounds, is an appropriately restorative break from her past work. The opening line, “Feels like I just woke up / Like all this time I’ve been asleep,” outlines this sentiment as well. Coupled with an electric guitar riff, the words are simple but honest. As a whole, the song signals an album which is introspective and reactive: Cyrus confesses in the chorus, “I’m not afraid of who I used to be.” Though the song is not groundbreakingly experimental, the pendulum has certainly swung back from the provocateur-Miley of the early 2010s.
“Malibu” is a clear musical successor to the first track, relying on an uptempo, drum-and-guitar-backed melody carried by the musician’s beautiful vocal timbre. Cyrus’s voice shines through in this album, both dreamlike and clear. “Rainbowland,” the only song featuring a different artist—Dolly Parton, her godmother, no less—is charming. Sampling a conversation with Parton, the duet’s harmonies give the track volume, and the quiet encouragement to “brush the judgment and fear aside” feels vaguely political without being divisive. The first quarter of the album is mellow, somewhat monotonously saccharine in a way that is uncharacteristic of Cyrus.
Though aptly launched by its opening tracks, the album never truly takes off past its starting point. The next stretch of the album is thematically dissonant, abandoning the cheeriness of the first three songs to instead confront the idea of loss. “Week Without You,” a breakup song which serves as a foil to the love expressed in “Malibu,” is grittier. Drawing on rock influences, the track is percussive, carefree, and dripping with attitude. “Miss You So Much,” a breathier and more emotionally distant piece, targets a different type of loss. Asking rhetorical questions such as “How can I miss you so much when you’re right here?”, the fifth track reverentially approaches the idea of memory. “I Would Die For You,” a shorter song with no intro or outro, marks the center of the album and associates great love with sacrifice. Strong as though the tracks may be in a vacuum, they represent an abrupt and frankly confusing turn from the dreamy positivity of the first tracks.
The second half of the album further diffuses its thematic energy. “Thinkin’” and “Love Someone” continue the breakup theme in an aggressive and strangely accusatory way. The former, though easy to listen to, is punctuated by repetitive single-note melodies coupled with a lack of lyrical depth. The latter, showcasing lyrics like “to make somebody stay you gotta love someone,” is vocally impressive with its belting, but the catharsis of the track feels unearned.
The album, far derailed from its earlier optimism, is unsuccessfully wrapped up by the closing track “Inspired.” The song, saturated in nostalgia, features country strings and heavy references to family. Urging the listener to “pull the handle on the door that opens up to change,” the closer echoes the transformation driven in by the rest of the album. And yet, for a conclusion to the album, the piece goes on convoluted tangents, including a warning about dying bees and overtly political undertones absent from the majority of “Younger Now.” The final lines of the album, a radical departure from the beginning, are nihilistic: “But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate? Is anyone watching us down here?” Though the songs set out to contemplate such questions, they raise a different one for the listener—how exactly did the album end up here?
“Younger Now” is not bereft of enjoyable moments—its title track and “Rainbowland” are clear evidence of Cyrus’s pop sensibilities. The the album is ultimately unsuccessful, however, in rehabilitating Cyrus’s country-pop image. The bait-and-switch of frontloading the album with her brightest tracks causes a slump in the second half. And the blatant rebrand beneath the guise of artistic reinvention—not even reinvention so much as return to an earlier style—feels forced rather than inspired. Though Cyrus manages to write several pleasing tracks, her “Younger Now” is mired in its purpose: To move forward, she tries to go back, and accomplishes neither.

Before the final song of a three-song encore, frontman Danny O’Donoghue asked the audience to pull out their phones and start recording. The Sept. 30 show at the Orpheum Theater had already been lengthy, but O’Donoghue had something to say: “Our album is called ‘Freedom Child,’ because we fancy our freedom has been under attack this year,” he shouted to a rapt crowd. “Freedom is about tolerance for us. ... I think that’s the reason why we’re all united, the Script family. There is no divide between us, there is no stage between us, we are one.” As soon as O’Donoghue finished speaking, the Script crashed into “Hall of Fame”—a feel-good adrenaline rush that the Irish band had been building towards all night. The audience didn’t stop cheering for the remainder of the show.
Throughout the night, O’Donoghue preached that same lesson of unity and oneness. The morals seemed genuine: There was no hint of irony or cynicism at the Orpheum. The subject matter may have been more political than the Script of the past (“I believe in the freedom to love who you want to love!” O’Donoghue shouted to the crowd), but the concert remained engagingly upbeat and enthusiastic. This is a band that believes in what they are saying, full stop. Their earnestness—while not groundbreaking—is infectious.
In all likelihood, one factor in the Script’s irrepressibly high energy is the two-year hiatus from which the band is now returning. The Sept. 30 show was the third of their current tour; the band last toured in 2015. “Freedom Child” came out Sept. 1. The band is back, just barely, and they still have all the relentless enthusiasm of novelty. O’Donoghue spent much of the show bouncing straight into the air like he was on a pogo stick. His physical presence, combined with the loud pop-rock the band was playing, kept the energy palpable. The tour’s merchandise and lighting was based around an “electricity” theme, with lots of neon lights and glowsticks—but the special effects were almost unnecessary. The energy came from the band.
At first glance, the physical space in the Orpheum Theater feels incongruous with such loud, flashy enthusiasm. The theater was built in 1852, and it remains formal and antique in atmosphere. It is a far cry from Radio City Music Hall, where the Script played the night prior. But if the Script had any doubts about the space, they didn’t show it. The lighting—well-suited to a bigger venue—reflected captivatingly off the balcony, bathing the entire audience in light. The sound only benefited from filling up all of a smaller room. O’Donoghue, especially, seemed to revel in the space: His favorite trick was to leave the stage and come into the audience through a variety of obscure doors. Over the course of the concert he made his way into every individual balcony box, as well as the balcony proper and the orchestra seats. During “The Energy Never Dies,” O’Donoghue got on top of the crimson velvet chairs and hopped from armrest to armrest, walking simultaneously through and above the crowd. The audience—which ranged dramatically in age—seemed almost ubiquitously invested in O’Donoghue’s motions. This was a crowd that remembered the Script. When he interacted with the crowd, they were prepared.
The Script remains, for all their refreshed energy, very much the group that these devotees recall. At one point early in the show, the band broke into a flashy, drum-based, strobe-light filled rock sequence—only to merge immediately into the classic 2010 heartbreak ballad “Nothing.” The relief in the audience was palpable. In general, they didn’t want glitz or hard rock. They wanted the earnest Script that they knew and loved. And the band—which performed only four new songs in a setlist of 16—played the part of the comeback kid flawlessly. The misleading “Nothing” intro summed up the show’s vibe overall: While the night advertised the Script as back and lightly rebranded, the moralistic, feel-good nostalgia that is the band’s trademark lurked close beneath the surface. The Script is beloved now, as they were five years ago, for their infectious and well-intentioned energy. The show at the Orpheum delivered exactly that.

President Donald Trump is famous for his vulgarity. His supporters venerate his ability to “tell it like it is,” regardless of whether the statement is true, even—or especially—if it is racist, sexist, or hurtful in another way. Trump’s message succeeded because his supporters believed in it, but also because of Trump’s ability to tell it like it is, or, in other words, to communicate his message in a way his supporters could understand. Though liberals like myself disagree with Trump’s opinions, we must acknowledge that his message won in part because it was digestible, whereas the liberal agenda was not. President Trump uses catchphrases, but liberals, especially on college campuses like Harvard, use rhetoric that is intellectual, pretentious, and inherently exclusive. Even worse, the language we use to explain identity politics can be blatantly condescending.
News organizations across the country have decried purported “student radicalism” on college campuses, with particular interest in the way students at Harvard and its peer institutions interact with identity politics. Terms we use everyday at Harvard, including “trigger warnings” when a subject could be emotionally damaging, and “safe spaces,” or places where people can feel comfortable sharing their stories, are used by conservatives to mock liberal sensitivity. Although some liberals might wish to find a better way to explain what all this jargon means, especially because these terms provoke conservatives to label us as “snowflakes,” the better question is why they provoke conservatives mock us in the first place.
A 2016 New Yorker article entitled, “The Big Uneasy,” which explored student activism at Oberlin, revealed how difficult it is for liberal college students to explain their complaints in simple terms. The article reported that a letter submitted by a group of black students to the college’s board and president claimed that Oberlin “functions on the premises of imperialism, white supremacy, capitalism, ableism, and a cissexist heteropatriarchy.” To highly educated students on liberal campuses, this argument makes sense, whether you agree with it or not. But to those outside of the ivory tower, the meaning of these -isms can be lost in their extravagance.
A disabled trans student in the New Yorker piece complained of “persistent, low-grade dehumanization from everyone,” continuing that he felt as though he’d entered the realm of “tokenism,” and was used as “proof of concept for other people.” While this student certainly faced real hardship as a disabled transgender individual that many Americans could relate to or understand, the language he used to describe his struggle unintentionally places his story in a realm of academia that inherently isolates him from almost all of America.
Two years ago, after Yale’s Erika Christakis sent an email to some students that questioned the rationale of regulating offensive Halloween costumes, The Atlantic published a piece that detailed the incident and included an excerpt from a student response letter. That excerpt said the professor’s email “trivialize[d] the harm done by these tropes and infantilizes the student body” and “fail[ed] to distinguish the difference between cosplaying fictional character and misrepresenting actual groups of people.” Though this response and the Oberlin list of demands were sent within a university context, they sparked national attention, and a national backlash, with conservatives ridiculing them for their unintelligibility.
The terms we use to describe our liberal platform need to be understandable for the audience they are trying to reach. This is not to say that we should resort to name-calling, like President Trump, who plays with the fires of nuclear war by calling Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man.” But if liberals want to make political correctness and identity politics politically viable for the general American public, we need to find a way to condense our message. Otherwise, it will forever be limited to colleges—the only places where terms like “infantilize,” “tokenism,” “proof of concept,” and “cissexist heteropatriarchy” are part of the common vocabulary.

Despite being home to sex shops, smoke shops, and a hemp store, the plan to open a new marijuana store in Harvard Square has been met with resistance. In February, the Cambridge City Council modified existing zoning ordinances to allow for the establishment of “five or six” new medical marijuana dispensaries in the city. As part of this change, Healthy Pharms, a nonprofit marijuana distributor, was given license to operate a discreet and secure dispensary from the Red House restaurant at 98 Winthrop St.
In response to this change, however, Raj K. Dhanda, owner of the Crimson Galeria, has filed a complaint in federal court to block the opening of the dispensary. The lawsuit cites the inconsistencies of state and city law with federal law, claiming that local and state offices are “facilitating and encouraging violations of the federal drug laws by licensing and permitting marijuana businesses.” Dhanda further implied that there would be larger negative implications of opening a medical marijuana dispensary in Harvard Square, arguing that “amongst other matters, marijuana businesses make bad neighbors, which include without limitation, emitting pungent odors, attracting undesirable visitors, increasing criminal activity, driving down property values, and limiting the rental of premises.”
At the root of this complaint, however, is the stigmatization of marijuana. The drug is a comparatively benign substance with limited short-term and long-term effects; it is arguably less dangerous than alcohol and less harmful than cigarettes, both of which are legalized. Meanwhile, the criminalization of marijuana continues to hurt society in various ways. Studies show that its criminalization has fed mass incarceration, torn apart families, cost taxpayer money, and contributed to racial inequality.
Moreover, Healthy Pharms, the proposed dispensary, operates as a nonprofit to safely distribute marijuana for medical rather than recreation purposes. Its presence in the Cambridge community would be beneficial. Marijuana has effective pain-relieving properties that cannot and should not be ignored, especially in the context of the growing opioid crisis. Lawsuits against the opening of medical marijuana dispensaries are, to be blunt, unjustified and harmful to the neighborhood.
The argument that a dispensary would harm the interests of surrounding businesses and violate community norms is groundless. In fact, the local community has already demonstrated its overwhelming support for the opening of the Health Pharms dispensary. Furthermore, it will be located inside a high-end restaurant and be accessible only to those with a medical license.
For these reasons, we join the Harvard Square Business Association in asking the Crimson Galeria to retract the lawsuit. Its high time Cambridge allow an appropriately regulated marijuana dispensary without being unnecessarily constrained by the judicial system.

In the majority of sexual assaults, men are the perpetrators and women are the survivors. And this fact shouldn’t be ignored. Pervasive sexism fueled by the patriarchy leads men to both subconsciously and consciously view women as inherently less deserving of respect. We can’t combat rape culture without also combatting these oppressive structures that constantly devalue women.
But, if we frame rape as solely something that men do to women, we leave many people out of the conversation, including those from marginalized groups. Many studies on rape are centered around women as survivors but rarely specify the sexual orientation or gender identity of these women.  Lack of specificity leads to erasure of LGBTQ identities, as being heterosexual and cisgender is typically the default assumption. Additionally, these studies frequently ignore victims who are trans, genderqueer, and gender nonconforming, as well as queer men.
One of my queer classmates was sexually taken advantage of at a party. The quotes throughout this piece are what they told me.
***
“It’s still really difficult for me to discuss what happened last year, but it’s important.”
***
Within the LGBTQ community, certain populations are at greater risk for sexual assault than others. For instance, trans, genderqueer, and gender nonconforming college students are five times as likely to be sexually assaulted as cis men, and slightly more likely than cis women.
Sexual assault also disproportionately affects bisexual people over their gay and straight counterparts—46 percent of bisexual women have been raped, which makes them nearly three times as likely to be raped as heterosexual women. Additionally, 37 percent of bisexual men experience rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner, compared to 29 percent of heterosexual men. While gay men are not more susceptible to rape than straight men, they are disproportionately affected by other forms of sexual violence—gay and bisexual men are twice as likely as heterosexual men to experience sexual violence other than rape.
Though these studies do not cover the entire spectrum of sexual orientations and gender identities, they provide a starting point for addressing sexuality, gender, and sexual assault. These statistics are alarming and, unfortunately, rarely talked about. More research and dialogue needs to be done on LGBTQ sexual assault cases in order to tackle this issue, especially since our collective silence on it could be preventing survivors from speaking out and accessing resources.
***
“Whenever my straight female friends had similar experiences, I did my best to connect them to the available resources. When it happened to me, however, I suddenly found myself with so many different anxieties I never thought I would have and couldn’t find the courage to seek out resources. I was worried that the resources available were more geared towards women, like I had often heard they were from other queer friends with similar experiences, and that no one would believe me.”
***
A variety of factors lead LGBTQ survivors to feel hesitant about accessing resources. Many resources are geared towards cis straight women, which can make survivors who are queer, trans, genderqueer, gender nonconforming, and/or men feel excluded. Some LGBTQ survivors may also worry about having to out themselves in order to get services. And those that do seek services risk being denied—85 percent of survivor advocates have worked with an LGBTQ survivor who was denied services because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
***
“My biggest worry was that if others did believe me, I’d be confirming the preconceived notions that some hold that queer people are predators and perverts. I’d grown up hearing that from family members in an attempt to ‘save me’ from my queerness and it hurt so much more knowing they would be validated if I added to that narrative.”
***
If the perpetrator was also LGBTQ, survivors may not want to report it because of a wish to be seen as a model minority. Queer culture is already heavily stigmatized by wider society as being impure and dangerous, so some within our community may be reluctant to expose underlying issues and thus perpetuate these stereotypes. Homophobia and transphobia place an unfair burden on queer people to constantly pretend that there’s nothing wrong with our community, because suggesting otherwise would confirm the prejudices of people who wish to strip us of our humanity. To be seen as human, queer people must be perfect.
***
“It’s important for me to help others understand just how difficult the aftermath can be for someone who is both queer and a person of color.”
***
We can’t ignore the intersectional identities that affect people’s decision to seek resources and justice. Some survivors may not report because of distrust of authority figures due to the prevalence of police brutality towards black, brown, and queer bodies. In a 2011 survey of 6,450 trans and gender nonconforming Americans, 46 percent of respondents reported being uncomfortable seeking police assistance. Moreover,  2 percent of those who interacted with police reported being sexually assaulted by police, with higher percentages for respondents who were black or Hispanic.
What can Harvard do to address some of these issues? First off, our resources for sexual assault should be more LGBTQ-inclusive and explicitly state that queer people are welcome. Additionally, queer resources on campus should include more information on sexual assault and more intentionally publicize that this information is available.
I also encourage everyone to be more mindful of the ways that we talk about sexual assault. It’s not just a women’s issue, but something that can affect anyone and disproportionately harms LGBTQ people. Thinking more critically about the causes of sexual assault and who it affects won’t completely eliminate it from our campus, but it’s a step in the right direction.

Harvard released a longlist of 20 semifinalists—winnowed down from 168 entries—in its competition to change the last line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s 181-year-old alma mater.
The Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging announced the competition to replace the final line, which has read “Till the stock of the Puritans die” since 1836, in April as a part of an effort to reconsider some of Harvard’s historic symbols.
Entries on the longlist include “For each creature of land, sea, or sky,” “Lest the hope of the Puritans die,” and “Veritas be Thy Destiny’s guide.” The task force has invited Harvard affiliates to comment on the entries on their “Solution Space,” an online tool that allows members of the University to suggest ideas for advancing Harvard toward inclusion. The window for commenting will close on October 31, after which the semifinalists will be forwarded to a panel of five judges—including Kurt Crowley, the associate conductor of the popular musical “Hamilton.”
The judges will select three entries to send to the University for final selection, and the winner will be revealed at the end of the fall semester or the beginning of the spring semester. Danielle S. Allen, a professor of Government and co-chair of the task force, said that the task force is seeking a line that “picked up the line of argument with the pursuit of truth and made clear that it was a both constant commitment and one accessible to people of all backgrounds.”
The competition also included an opportunity for students to submit a “musical variant” of “Fair Harvard,” for which no submissions were received.
The task force released the longlist following the release of its draft report of recommendations for improving inclusion and belonging on campus last week. The report includes a set of shared standards for the University to ensure all Harvard affiliates experience “full membership in the Harvard community.”
The first recommendation in the recently released discussion draft describes a need for the University to adopt “inclusive symbols,” according to Allen.
“The University should revise its values statement; use public art and symbols to bring 21st century Harvard into visibility in public spaces and shared experiences,” the report reads.
The revision to “Fair Harvard,” however, has been met largely with apathy and criticism from students. On one side, several students said that the change was not significant enough to make a difference on campus, while others like Emily M. Hall ’18 denounced the change as a means of “revising history.”
Other students, though, have supported the measure.
“Understanding how old the university is, it makes sense for some things to be sort of reflect a different demographic,” said Hasani A. Hayden ’19, the president of the Black Students Association. “Since Harvard has become a more diverse institution, we’re just happy to see that the institution could look into growing along with the university.”
Allen added that the alma mater is an “anchor ritual” for the University.
“It gets used for Freshmen Convocation. It gets used at Commencement. A campus’ rituals are sort of its DNA,” she said. “We have to pay attention to the kind of ethos we are establishing for the campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Departmental chairs in the Social Sciences division met with two members of a Faculty presidential search advisory committee on Thursday, according to several chairs of Social Science departments.
The committee—led by Arts and Humanities Dean Robin Kelsey, who attended Thursday’s meeting, along with Biology professor Hopi Hoekstra—was formed in August. It will work with the search committee that will ultimately pick current University President Drew G. Faust’s successor.
While the chairs from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences discussed their preferences for a presidential candidate, they agreed from the outset not to bring up names of specific candidates for the job, according to Gary Urton, chair of the Anthropology department.
“This is such a high profile search, and anyone whose name is mentioned is going to be someone well-known, and if the name is put out there in the open it could cause all sorts of concern,” he said.
Urton said that the Trump presidency and diversity were among the issues the professors said are crucial for the search committee to consider.
Since Trump took office in January, Faust has stepped up her lobbying efforts, meeting with members of Congress about undocumented students at Harvard, federal support for research funding, and a hypothetical tax on University endowments. And, while Faust was the first female president in Harvard’s history, the school has yet to have a President who is not white.
Urton said that some of his colleagues at the meeting raised the concern that no Faculty members are a part of the body that has the ultimate authority to choose the president. He said, however, that after the conversation he felt that Faculty will have a voice in the process.
“I, at least, came away with the sense that, while we won’t be making the decision, they have been really intent on eliciting faculty opinions, faculty voices, faculty concerns,” he said.
Faculty representation in the selection of Harvard’s president has historically been a point of contention for some professors.  Faculty did not have a formal role in the search process until 2006, when a faculty advisory committee was formed during the presidential search that lead to Faust’s selection.
Urton said that discord between former University President Lawrence H. Summers and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences highlights the importance of including faculty voices.
“We saw in the recent case of Larry Summers that if there’s a tension between the Faculty and the president, it’s not helpful to anybody,” he said. “I think everybody wants to avoid that situation.”
As was the case with Faust, a former dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the next President could come from within the University. Urton said that the the Social Science chairs did not explicitly discuss a preference for internal or external candidates, but that there was general agreement that it would be easier if the person knew Harvard well because of its “idiosyncratic” bureaucracy.
Urton said Kelsey and Hoekstra did not express plans to come to another meeting of Social Science chairs or to meet with chairs individually.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of Monday, the popular Quad gathering spot Cabot Café is now open in the mornings, following student demands to extend the coffee shop's hours.
After six years of business, the student-run late night café decided to expand its hours to open from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. every Monday through Thursday. Previously, the coffee shop was open only from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Sunday through Thursday nights.
Cabot Café staff say they decided to extend their hours after considering students’ interest in the earlier hours and the café’s recent financial success.
“We’ve had a lot of demand for it in recent years,” said Pepo A. Zivny '19, Cabot Café’s facilities manager. “And the café’s been doing so well, at least financially, that we thought we could risk it.”
The café is located in the basement of Cabot House and offers a variety of coffee and tea drinks, as well as bagels and pastries. For now, the menu will be the same in the mornings and evenings, according to senior barista Maeva M. O’Brien '18.
In addition to providing refreshments, Cabot Café serves as a frequent hang-out and study space for Quad residents. It showcases student artwork and hosts live performances, according to its website.
O’Brien said that because of this unique role as a nighttime gathering space, she expects that the café will likely see less traffic in the morning than in the evenings.
“At night, a lot of people go to the café to spend a lot of time there working, or studying, or talking to friends, and I don’t know if that culture will be the same in the morning,” she said.
For some like Cabot House resident Emma S. J. Schwartz '18, the new hours are a welcome change. Schwartz said she looks forward to working in Cabot Café in the mornings.
“I think the hours are very convenient for people who have 9 a.m. classes, 10 a.m. classes, 11 a.m. classes to get their coffee before they go,” she said. “I think they’re going to get a lot of business.”
But for others, the new hours may not be as useful as Cabot Café staff hope.
Ana K. Cepeda Diaz ‘19 said she was less excited about the café’s choice in hours, adding that it should open on Friday and Saturday evenings instead, when Cabot’s dining hall does not offer late-night snack options at Brain Break.
“I found it odd, because you’d think they wouldn’t have a market if breakfast is open, so it would compete with breakfast,” Cepeda Diaz said.
While the café adjusts to its new schedule, baristas say they already look forward to pursuing other changes to Cabot Cafe’s operations.
“We’re always looking to expand our menu and expand our drink options,” Zivny said. “In the coming months or weeks, we might invest in a cold brew machine so that we can offer slightly more caffeine to our very hardworking students."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As social media becomes increasingly integral to everyday life, four Harvard professors discussed its impact on individuals’ identities and relationships at a panel event Monday.
Panelists including Law School professor Yochai Benkler, Berkman Center fellow Judith S. Donath, Medical School professor Michael O. Rich, and Kennedy School professor Todd T. Rogers gave their perspectives on social media in a panel moderated by Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild and organized by Harvard’s Mind Brain Behavior initiative.
Benkler discussed the phenomenon of “fake news,” delineating two contrasting psychological theories about how humans consume information.  According to Benkler, one camp believes that people are rational truth-seekers, unintentionally led astray by falsehoods they see on social media, while the other argues that people intentionally seek out information confirming their worldview and ignore contradictory evidence.
Benkler also discussed positive ramifications of social media, including “the ways in which social media has successfully enabled decentralized political action” from the Black Lives Matter movement to the Arab Spring.
Donath explained her work on an evolutionary biology theory called “signaling,” which analyzes “what keeps communication honest enough to function.” Social media embodies a constant balance between honesty and deception, she said, and ultimately, social media feeds become constructions of how people want to present themselves.
Rich, a pediatrician, discussed the impact of social media on children, citing statistics that alarmed the crowd in William James Hall.
“Building a social media profile is a coming-of-age ritual,” Rich said, “15 percent of kids age eight to twelve have social media...70 percent are girls, and...it disproportionately affects those of lower socioeconomic status.”
These children, according to Rich, spend on average nearly eight hours per day on screens. In post-panel questions and interviews, both audience members and the other panelists expressed disbelief and concern at the statistics.
Rogers, a behavioral scientist, explained how social media could motivate individuals to react to the activities of their communities. Studies have shown people are more likely to vote if they see that their friends have already voted, he said, or become dispirited with their own work if they are overexposed to exceptional work from their peers through social media.
Benkler praised his fellow panelists after the event, emphasizing the importance of the “diverse aspects of the same socio-technological phenomenon”  and the “remarkably wide image of the range of concerns and the range of observations.”
While all four speakers identified concerns with social media, some said they were optimistic, too: “Social media has a real potential for changing [and] democratizing the world, for reaching out to those we’ve been told are our enemies and getting to know them as real people,” Rich said. “To show our true selves, our authentic selves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Various political groups across campus teamed up last week to help register voters and encourage students to remain engaged in the political process.
Early last week, the Institute of Politics held voter registration drives in upperclassman dining halls, outside Annenberg Hall, and around campus.  In addition to registering new voters, students were asked to sign “voter pledge cards” to commit  to go to the polls in November, according to Andrew F. Miner ’18, the chair of the IOP’s Community Action committee.
Miner said a number of the IOP’s fall fellows, including journalist Dan Balz and former Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell, participated in the voter registration efforts. Several student groups signed on to the efforts as well.
The events coincided with National Voter Registration Day on Tuesday.  According to its website, the effort engaged thousands of volunteers and yielded over 750,000 new voters in 2016.
Matt Singer, founder of National Voter Registration Day, spoke to a group of IOP members on Thursday over dinner about his efforts to bring more Americans into the political process. Since its inception, National Voter Registration Day has been formally recognized by the National Association of Secretaries of State.
Singer noted what he called unnecessary obstacles that organizers like him face in registering new voters, including a lack of government funding for registration efforts and challenges posed by voter ID laws.
According to harvardstudentsvote.com, a part of the IOP’s efforts to mobilize voters on campus, only 24 percent of eligible Harvard students voted in 2014, the last year for which voting data is available.
Miner said he thinks students’ distaste with the political system accounts for the student body’s lackluster turnout numbers.
“I think many people that are disenchanted or apathetic about voting are people who don’t enjoy politics…and ultimately think that our system is either rigged [or] doesn’t effectively articulate or seek to promote the common good,” he said.
But Miner encouraged students to harness that anger into motivation to effect real change.
“The belief that our system is doing poorly right now is the thing that gives one the opportunity to…make a difference and ensure that our government is accountable,” he said.
Voter Registration Day comes in the wake of an election cycle that saw now-President Donald Trump make claims of widespread voter fraud.
Miner lamented the politicization of voting rights in recent years.
“Making it really easy for people to register to vote should not be a partisan issue,” he insisted. “I think that’s something we can all get behind.”
Since Trump took office, Harvard students have organized several protests against the administration’s new policies, including its decision to repeal DACA and ban transgender soldiers.
“This current administration has galvanized a lot of people to take more direct political action,” said Miner.
According to Miner, over 300 Harvard affiliates were registered to vote over the past week.  Miner said that more than 600 students signed “voter pledge” cards as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For months, Drew G. Faust had successfully courted Harvard big-wigs in backroom hotel meetings, bested hundreds of competitors, and dodged reporters in her quest to become Harvard’s 28th president. But she faced one final hurdle: a faulty parking lot gate.
It was February 2007, and she and University General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano ’83 were trapped in a car in the parking lot of the Doubletree Hotel. Their anxiety mounted by the minute.
Faust, then the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, was slated to teach an undergraduate seminar on the Civil War—and if she didn’t make it back to campus in time, she feared students would discern the reason: she had just been offered the Harvard presidency.
The rendezvous at the Doubletree was Faust’s final meeting with the presidential search committee. After the committee—composed of the entire Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—picked Faust from a slate of 750 candidates, she had to wait a week until the Overseers could formally vote to confirm her.
In the meantime, rumors were swirling. The Crimson had reported that Faust’s name had risen to the top of the search committee’s short list. Too much time in the parking lot could’ve fueled further speculation.
"The thing wouldn't lift, and we thought ‘It’s gonna blow our cover. Because when she’s late for class, everyone who’s so suspicious anyway is going to think, aha!’” Faust said in an interview Wednesday, reflecting on what she laughingly referred to as the “ridiculous search” leading up to her appointment.
Now, with ten years of the presidency under her belt, Faust is on her way out, and the hunt is on for her replacement. Harvard’s presidential searches are famous for their secrecy, as the search committee endeavors to fend off national media scrutiny and Crimson reporters in pursuit of a scoop.
The Crimson broke the news from an airplane over New England when the 1991 search committee picked Neil L. Rudenstine. Crimson reporters similarly reported that Lawrence H. Summers was Harvard’s 27th president two days before the Board of Overseers confirmed him in 2001. So during the 2006 search, Faust said she had to resort to “various devious methods of avoiding The Crimson.”
En route to her final interview on Superbowl Sunday, Faust said the search committee instructed her to walk down JFK Street with her husband and her dog, then slip through the Garage—an indoor shopping complex—to evade reporters. She was told to exit onto a side street, where she would be “swept off” in a waiting car to the downtown Boston office of senior fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72, then an Overseer. Shortly after that meeting, she was offered the job at the Doubletree Hotel.
Crimson reporters weren’t the only ones left in the dark. Faust had to keep the news even from her daughter, Jessica Rosenberg, who was then a fact-checker at The New Yorker.
"All the people on The New Yorker were constantly saying ‘what have you heard? Is your mother going to be president? What’s going on?’ And I wanted to have her have plausible deniability,” Faust said, adding that she vaguely told her to “bring some decent clothes” when she came to Boston that weekend.
Still sworn to secrecy, she traveled to Bryn Mawr College, her alma mater, for a board meeting. But in the days leading up to the Overseers vote, The Crimson and several other news outlets reported that the search committee had settled on Faust.
"I got on my airplane in Philadelphia, and the people on the airplane burst into applause when they saw me,” she recalled. “And then finally the next day the Overseers voted—and I could speak again."
A decade later, as she contemplated leaving the post, Faust found herself in stealth mode yet again. With the end of the University-wide capital campaign nearing, she said the idea of stepping down had been “kind of jelling in my brain.”
“It seemed to me that the next stage of planning for the University, planning for fundraising, planning for the future, should be done by the person who’s going to execute on it—and I wasn’t going to,” she said. “Someone said to me at one point, ‘you ought to stay for another seven years, or one year.’ You know, it’s either make the plan and follow it out, or get out of the way for somebody else to do it.”
But once she made up her mind to bow out, she said she had to keep her decision quiet. She told Lee in the spring, and Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Paul Andrew soon after so he could pull together the announcement. On June 14, Faust made her decision to step down next summer public.
That evening, she held an impromptu celebratory event with friends and colleagues at Elmwood, the president’s residence. Nearly 30 people stopped by for drinks and well-wishing, she said.
“It was just emotional and sweet and very moving for me, very gratifying that people were being appreciative,” she said.
Now, as her tenure as president draws to a close, Faust said will focus on a number of her remaining priorities—including wrapping up the capital campaign, implementing recommendations by a task force on inclusion and belonging, and continuing federal advocacy in Washington. Meanwhile, the committee charged with finding her replacement has begun meeting, once again behind closed doors. Faust will stay out of the process, though.
"I think it’s very important that I not be involved in the search process because this is to be another administration, another regime,” she said. “I've had my wonderful experience and it’s now in the hands of the Fellows and the search committee."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fierce battle for parking spaces, a regular part of Cantabrigians’  daily routine, has intensified as Smith Campus Center construction has ramped up.
Construction on the Smith Campus Center renovation began in early 2016 and is slated to continue through fall 2018. Long-term street closures of Holyoke St. and Dunster St., compounded with noise and dust from the construction site and diminished foot traffic, have put a strain on local businesses.
A major side effect of the street closures has been the loss of parking spaces, including four handicap spots which have been relocated, though Dunster St. and Mt. Auburn St. will open again in the coming months.  In addition to the closed parking spaces, some business owners have observed construction workers parking in the remaining available spots, making parking more difficult to find.
Lawrence D. Mahoney, a long-time salesman at the Andover Shop, a formalwear shop adjacent to the Smith Campus Center on Holyoke Street, said that remaining parking spaces near the Smith Campus Center that could be used by local businesses are instead taken up by construction workers.
“That’s a space that could be used by the public to make up for some of the spaces that have been taken by the parking closures due to the construction,” Mahoney said, referring to the triangular median at the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Bow Streets. “However, the only one that’s parked there are construction vehicles.”
Harvard has tried to reduce the impact of construction on parking by allowing construction workers to take Harvard shuttles for free and by fining subcontractors who park in residential and metered spaces.
“Construction mitigation personnel monitor parking in the area of each construction site and if contractors are found to be inappropriately parking in metered or residential spaces, there are contractual based fines that can be levied against the offenders,” Brigid O’Rourke, a University spokesperson, wrote in an email.
Still, the loss of parking spaces has taken a toll on local businesses. Panja Lymswan, co-owner of Spice Thai Cuisine on Holyoke St., described how consequential the construction has been to his employees who drive to work everyday.
“It was difficult to find parking before and now there’s even less parking,” said Lymswan. “Usually my employees have to park about two to three or four to five blocks away, about a quarter mile. It takes about a half hour to find a spot.”
The loss of parking has affected more than just Lymswan’s employees. Customers, he says, do not come into the restaurant like they did before the construction began.
“Before at night time we had a lot of parking and people out of town could park. But now there isn’t any parking anywhere so not too many people travel from other towns to eat here,” Lymswan said.
On the other side of the Smith Center, businesses along Dunster St. are experiencing many of the same problems. George Papalimberis, owner of La Flamme Barber Shop, says that his customers have been most affected.
“Many of my customers come from the surrounding suburbs such as Watertown, Belmont, Lexington, Lincoln, Somerville, Medford,” said Papalimberis. “With the construction it can take thirty minutes to walk to and from my shop. Many of them don’t have the time for that.”
In an email to The Crimson, O’Rourke wrote that one of the purposes of closing the streets adjacent to the Smith Campus Center has been to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers in the area.
“When construction activity occurs on constrained sites in any urban location, the use of parking spaces may be required to ensure safe construction methods,” O’Rourke wrote. “Sometimes this can impact the availability of parking.  Harvard will continue to work with both local businesses and residents to address any questions or concerns they may have regarding parking.”
While the completion of the Smith Campus Center is still a year away, local businesses may soon feel a reprieve from the dearth of parking spaces.
“The metered parking spaces located on  Mt. Auburn and Dunster Streets that are being utilized for construction activities are scheduled to become available in the coming months, which should alleviate some stress on the availability of parking in that area of Harvard Square,” O’Rourke wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College’s Honor Council is increasing its outreach to students this semester—adding meetings with athletic teams and making more presentations to undergraduate classes—as part of a broader push to grow the body’s influence on campus.
The Council, a two-year-old administrative body composed of students, faculty and administrators, adjudicates issues of academic dishonesty at Harvard. On Monday, the group released its second-ever annual report revealing the number of “inappropriate collaboration” cases at the College doubled over the past two academic years—an increase the report obliquely attributed to widespread cheating in a popular computer science course last fall.
The Council’s role on campus has recently come into question, particularly after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted a recommendation that the body help enforce Harvard’s social group policy, which penalizes members of single-gender social organizations. In an interview Friday, Council Secretary Flehinger and members Jack W. Jue ’18 and Margery W. Tong ’17 detailed a number of steps the body is now taking to raise its profile and publicize its purpose at the College.
In particular, the three mentioned a pilot program, debuted August 2017, in which Council members met with three athletic teams—football, men’s soccer, and field hockey—to discuss issues of academic dishonesty. In each case, Council representatives traveled to the teams’ locker rooms to hold separate, roughly hour-long sessions with student-athletes.
During these discussions, Council members talked the athletes through different scenarios, according to Flehinger. He said all three teams were “incredibly responsive.”
The College rolled out the Honor Code and formed the Honor Council in wake of a massive cheating scandal in a government course that roiled campus in 2012. Many of the more than 120 students enrolled in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” who underwent investigation for cheating were varsity athletes.
Flehinger said Friday that the Council decided to meet with athletes specifically because varsity teams are groups that “you can reach.” He added teams are available for free-flowing discussion in an intimate setting.
“You can speak directly to them and they will be open and speak to you,” he said.
He said the Council contacted the football, men’s soccer, and field hockey teams in particular because those programs arrived on campus for preseason weeks before school started, making them easily accessible. Council members reached out to the women’s soccer team, too, but were unable to set up a meeting due to a scheduling conflict.
Flehinger said the body is looking to recruit more athletes to serve as members of the Council.
“We’ve always wanted to include athletes in the process, the reason we actually wanted to set Honor Council meetings on Mondays is because it’s the day [athletes] are least likely to have competitions,” he said.
In addition to speaking with athletic teams, Council members are slated to present to 39 undergraduate courses this semester, as well as to the roughly 60 freshman-only Expository Writing classes. Last year, the body presented only to Expository Writing courses.
Flehinger said the Council hired an intern over the summer, Stephanie J. Chan ’20, who reached out to dozens of faculty in the months leading up to the school year asking whether Council members could stop by one of their classes. For the most part, Flehinger said, professors were receptive to the idea.
Tong said she thought the class presentations that have taken place to date—some are scheduled for later in the semester—have worked out very well.
“It has sparked discussion in class about academic integrity,” she said. “I find often after presenting that the professors will chime in, discussing their collaboration policies, how they feel about the Honor Code—this shows that members of the Faculty are really engaged with the Honor Code.”
As a third prong of its increased outreach, the Council this year expanded the number of Student Academic Integrity Fellows, non-voting undergraduate members of the Council who help guide peers accused of academic dishonesty through the body’s adjudicatory process.
Over the past two years, roughly 60 percent of students who appeared before the Council chose to work either with these fellows or with personal advisers, according to the body’s report released Monday.
“We want to have a larger presence on campus and I think our goal for the Student Academic Integrity Fellow program is to have them not only be a support for the students but also to take on a larger ambassadorial role on campus,” Tong said. “What we hope is that they will sort of act as the face of the Honor Council.”
Jue added that the fellows plan to hand out chocolate bars in front of the Science Center to wish students “good luck” on midterms and finals this semester.
Flehinger said the Council will continue efforts to enlarge its campus profile in coming years.
“We’ll be increasing the role of Honor Council members as student leaders on campus,” he said. “These guys are incredible leaders and I think that’s one of the things you’ll see in the next five years.”
The Council plans to hold a town hall meeting Thursday evening, open to all College affiliates, to discuss the “specifics” of the report it released Monday.

The number of reported rapes on Harvard’s Cambridge campus dropped to 27 in 2016, down from over 30 the year before, according to the Harvard University Police Department’s Annual Security Report.
The decrease in reported rapes, however, came with an increase in non-consensual fondling reports, which grew from six to 11 cases in 2016.
Only two of the rapes reported at Harvard were deemed by HUPD to be “unfounded,” which encompasses crimes that are “found to be false or baseless” after an investigation by the police.
Though only Brown saw more reported rapes than Harvard on Ivy League campuses this year, the then-director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response said in 2016 that the relatively high report rate may indicate a greater awareness of resources for victims of sexual assault.
Yale followed Harvard with 24 reported rapes this year, while Cornell’s police department saw the fewest reported rapes, with only two in 2016.
The year also saw an increase in dating violence reports, from 12 to 21. According to HUPD, the category is defined as “violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.”
One case of each rape, fondling, aggravated assault and dating violence were also reported on the Longwood campus, which, besides five burglaries, constituted the only crimes reported in the area.
In addition to sexual offenses and dating violence, Harvard’s Cambridge campus also saw a significant rise in burglaries on campus, which constituted the plurality of reported crimes. In 2016, HUPD received 70 total burglary reports, a steep increase from roughly 40 in both 2015 and 2014 putting Harvard first in reported burglaries on campus among the Ivy League. For comparison, Yale, which reported the next highest burglary count, saw 37 reports.
In fall 2016, Harvard saw a string of laptop thefts in the River Houses. More recently, laptops, wallets, and other belongings were stolen from rooms in two freshman dorms and Pforzheimer House.
Harvard is required to release an Annual Security Report and Annual Fire Report every year in accordance with the Clery Act. This year’s report, titled “Playing it Safe,” was sent to Harvard affiliates via email on Oct. 1 and details crime statistics from the 2014 to 2016 calendar years. In his greeting prefacing the report, HUPD Chief of Police Francis “Bud” D. Riley reported that roughly 93 percent of all crime on Harvard’s campus is property crime, but that the urban campus poses challenges to safety.
“Although reported crime at Harvard is low… it is important for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to remember that we are located in an urban setting, and must contend with many of the crime and safety issues that exist in any city,” Riley wrote.

At halftime of Harvard’s faceoff with Georgetown, the scoreboards ringing the second deck of seats at RFK Stadium displayed a tally of 31-2. The Crimson (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) showed the Hoyas (1-3) no mercy through 30 minutes of play, and the blowout continued until the final whistle. After a Week 1 loss to Rhode Island, Harvard proved its penchant for winning on the road and beating non-conference opponents had not just disappeared with the new season.
Fans began to filter out of their seats as soon as it was apparent that Georgetown would not make things interesting down the stretch. All told, the Crimson prevailed, 41-2.
“Made a ton of plays,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Really did a great job of forcing turnovers. We did some great things in the kicking game.”

Hoyas quarterback Clay Norris had a rough afternoon under center, only completing 13 of 29 passes, tossing one interception, and being sacked four times. At times, the junior looked incapable of creating offense, as Georgetown only put up 201 total yards.
The Crimson’s defensive line was the main culprit in Norris’ struggles—the quarterback faced pressure on seemingly every play, and he fumbled twice on sacks.
The two defensive standouts on Harvard’s line were senior Stone Hart and junior DJ Bailey. The duo each forced Norris to fumble, and Bailey sacked Norris twice for a total loss of 19 yards.
Early in the first quarter, the Hoyas threatened to score. Norris had driven his offense to the Crimson’s 24, and on first-and-10, he took the snap and dropped back. Hart blasted around the right side, quickly flattening Norris. At a crucial moment in which Georgetown could have ignited its offense, junior defensive tackle Richie Ryan scooped up Norris’ fumble to flip the field.
Bailey’s forced fumble came at a less crucial time—by that point in the second quarter, Harvard had already built a 21-0 lead.
“Yeah, they’re pretty good,” Hoyas coach Rob Sgarlata said. “They’re tough because if you put your guys in a one-on-one matchup with them, you struggle sometimes.”
This season, Hart has eight tackles, including 1.5 sacks. Bailey has matched his teammate’s tackle mark while pacing the squad in sacks with four.
JAKE AND JOE SHOW
For a second straight week, neither of Murphy’s pair of field generals took a big leap forward. Freshman Jake Smith and fifth-year senior Joe Viviano continued their auditions for a possible starting job, and though neither stood out above the other, Smith started each of the last contests and has garnered the majority of the playing time.
Against Georgetown, Viviano was introduced later and played less overall than in the Brown game. The Berwyn, Pa., native entered for the last drive of the second quarter and also picked up some garbage-time snaps in the fourth.
However, much like last week, when Viviano first had his name called, he guided Harvard downfield like a man possessed.
On his lone appearance in the first half, Viviano led a 38-yard drive, 37 yards of which he personally contributed. He threw for 31 on three attempts, targeting junior Justice Shelton-Mosley twice and senior Ryan Antonellis once, and he also picked up six yards on the ground.
“Just felt like [Viviano] could give us a spark,” Murphy said. “At times we had played well offensively. At times we sort of stalled, and it wasn’t necessarily completely attributable to the quarterback.”
“We’ll figure it out, but we’re getting better every day at the quarterback position,” Murphy added.
Overall, Viviano was 5-of-10 for 66 yards and a touchdown. Smith completed 16 of 30 passes for 214 yards, though he was also picked off twice.
RECORD RETURN
On the opening kickoff, Justice Shelton-Mosley fielded Hoyas kicker Brad Hurst’s strike at the 3-yard line. In a flash, the junior had nearly crossed midfield, ultimately being dragged down at the Crimson’s 46.
Shelton-Mosley’s first return of the game was a sign of things to come. After a three and out for Georgetown, Hurst attempted to pin Harvard deep on the punt, but Shelton-Mosley had other plans. The Sacramento, Calif., native circled left behind his blockers and burned down the sideline, taking the punt 91 yards to give the Crimson a 7-0 advantage.
On the play, Shelton-Mosley broke Harvard’s record for longest punt return for a touchdown, and this feat solidified his case for Ivy League Special Teams Player of the Week.
Shelton-Mosley posted 169 all-purpose yards against the Hoyas, and he leads the Crimson with 127.3 per game.
“We’ve been talking about that as a unit this whole past week, trying to be the best… punt return team in the country,” Shelton-Mosley said. “It all starts with Coach Craw [Ryan Crawford]... and then executing on the field with the guys that are out there.”
