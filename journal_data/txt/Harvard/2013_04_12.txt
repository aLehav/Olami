After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As  Tess V. Davison ’16 trills in the closing number, “Wonderful Town” is  love at first sight. It’s difficult to determine which aspect of the  performance best captures its vivacity. Is it the neon-clad prostitutes  or the Brazilian Navy shimmying to the conga? Is it the nearly bursting  bosom of the cantankerous old mother played by Justin S. Pereira ’13, an  actor who often dons female garb with the Hasty Pudding? Maybe it’s the  exaggerated jazz hands of the nightclub owner, or the painfully awkward  Walgreens grocer, or even the Irish jail guards. Or perhaps it’s the  harmony of lead actresses Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15 and Davison.  “Wonderful Town,” directed by Susanna B. Wolk ’14 and playing at the  Loeb Mainstage through Saturday, boasts a cast of talented actors and  singers who breathe new life and laughter into an old, classic show  through remarkably convincing performances. 
From  the beginning, the play leaves behind a drab and impersonal New York  City and instead ushers in the bright and bustling Christopher Street, a  colorful set designed by Madi L. Taylor ’16 that becomes home to  struggling artists and ex-footballers alike. All of the inhabitants of  Christopher Street appear to be straight out of an American Apparel ad,  some with brightly colored tutus and sharply contrasting tights. Costume  designers Anne A. Power ’16 and Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 present a  whirlwind of color that both overwhelms and entices, all the way down to  the teal socks that compliment the powder blue suit of nightclub owner  Speedy Valenti (Mark J. Mauriello ’15). Sisters Ruth (Leimkuhler) and  Eileen (Davison), two small-town girls from Ohio following their dreams  to stardom, find themselves pulled into this rainbow-hued bohemian  paradise. But their first night on Christopher Street is anything but  calm as they face hecklers who mistake them for prostitutes. The musical  follows their journey through auditions and romance as they struggle to  stand on their own two feet, often literally, in the Big Apple.
While  the witty lyrics give the musical its substance, the actors, supported  by the jazzy orchestra directed by Madeline Smith ’14, give “Wonderful  Town” its soul. The first duet between Leimkuhler and Davison as they  lie in bed is both touching and deeply amusing. The two sisters clutch  each other out of terror as they plaintively muse, “Why, oh why, oh why,  oh—why did we ever leave Ohio?” While the lyrical humor is derived from  the rhyme, the terrified glances between sisters solidify their  apprehension. Not only do the two play well off each other, their voices  also harmonize elegantly. Davison hits the dainty high notes in a  manner suited to her flirtatious, feminine character while Ruth  gracefully embraces the lower notes, reflecting her stronger-willed  nature. In a later song, Ruth bitterly belts out that the “sure way to  lose a man” is through correcting his grammar and insulting his  intelligence. Leimkuhler’s representation of Ruth in this scene is  strongly portrayal of Renée Zellweger’s Roxie Hart in 2004’s “Chicago”  film adaption, complete with a sassy stubbornness and strongly  exaggerated facial expressions to convey the song’s spirit.
Despite  the spectacular and alluring performances of the two female  protagonists, their acting and singing do not overwhelm the rest of the  cast. Every character is portrayed with such a degree of nuance and care  that, although multiple actors play multiple parts, each character has  his or her own distinct personality. Speedy Valenti, played by  Mauriello, is one such unique character. His habit of exiting the stage  with jazz hands ties neatly into his extravagant costume and career  choice. This character could easily have been over-the-top, but  Mauriello keeps Valenti’s oddball personality loveable and just the  tiniest bit loathe-able. Frank Lippencott, the socially inept Walgreens  grocer (Alex B. Miller ’15) is the ideal representation of the overeager  nerd who is both uncomfortable and amusing to watch. At an awkward  dinner party, he tells a joke about a banana split that falls  delightfully flat, leaving the other guests visibly embarrassed. Officer  Lonigan’s (Yates A. Norton, a graduate student) harmonized number with a  troupe of Irish police officers brings a bit of the Green Isles to the  stage in a way that is surprisingly believable; their convincing  faux-Irish accents are noticeable but not insensitive. Even Wreck  (Matthew W. G. Walker ’16), an ex-football star who could have been  played as a flat, predictable trope, instead undergoes a touching  transition between pride and subtle disappointment as he remembers his  lost youth.
Perhaps  one of the greatest strengths of “Wonderful Town” is the acting, which  transcends the music and lines. From Bob Baker’s (Mark R. Heath ’14)  love-struck grin to Leimkuhler’s hilarious bouncing subway ride, each  actor’s range of emotions, not only in their faces but in their body  movements, drives the story home. At the end of the show, the  performers’ honest and passionate portrayals of each character remains  the best part of a wonderful “Wonderful Town.”

For  better or worse, Marlon Brando’s famous line—“Hey Stella!”—remains an  iconic staple of the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams’ play,  “A Streetcar Named Desire.” But the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club aims  to redefine preconceptions of the play, presenting a unique take on  “Streetcar” at the Adams Pool Theatre beginning Thursday night.
With  an original musical score and an honest return to Williams’s depiction  of the characters instead of what the iconic actors portrayed in the  movie, this stage production is different from the film version most  audiences are familiar with, director Sayantan Deb ’14 says. 
The  play tells the story of Blanche (Ema H. Horvath ’16) who travels to New  Orleans to stay with her sister Stella (Olivia L. Ball ’14). Blanche’s  arrival upsets the dynamic between Stella and her husband Stanley (Peter  K. Bestoso ’14), while Stanley’s friend Mitch (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15, a  Crimson Arts columnist) complicates matters with his romantic interest  in Blanche. 
Live  music is a distinctive addition to this production of “Streetcar,”  which features a score performed by composer and music director Hugh P.  Zabriskie ’16. During winter recess, Zabriskie traveled to New Orleans  to understand the music and culture of the play’s setting. 
“I  realized I needed to strike a happy medium between that New Orleans  sound and at the same time have music that illuminates the mood of the  scene,” Zabriskie says. 
Cast  members also find that returning to Williams’s original text instead of  basing their characters off of the actors in the movie version provides  them with greater agency to explore themes and emotions in the play   . 
“I feel like we are all something entirely different…I certainly feel like I am trying to make Mitch my own,” Venook says.
Cognizant  of Brando’s distinct performance as Stanley, Bestoso also says he tries  to separate the character from the actor in his portrayal. 
Deb ultimately hopes that audiences will find a level of emotional depth that transcends previous imaginings of “Streetcar.”
 “If the audience can come in here...and rediscover ‘Streetcar’ from the words, that has always been my goal,” Deb says.

Tyga got you down? You're not alone. Eliot House is hosting an alternative to Yardfest, featuring a performance by the up-and-coming hip hop and soul artist Shea Rose. On Saturday, doors—or gates, rather—to the Eliot courtyard open at 6:30, and Rose goes on at 7:00.
Though new on the music scene, Rose has already made a name for herself among critics. She's won Boston Music Awards both in 2011 and in 2012 and earned accolades from reviewers and Queen Latifah alike. So far Rose's discography comprises an EP, "Rock 'n Rose," and a mixtape, "Little Warrior."
On tracks like "Free Love," Rose presents her traditionally soulful side with slinky vocals and a classic guitar-bass-drums backup band. Rose is not married to refinement, however. On some of her more confrontational tracks—take "Dumb Boys," for example—Rose lays down aggressive rhymes over an electronic track with a danceable beat. At times, Rose has even branched away from her usual areas of soul and hip hop. She was a featured artist on the Grammy-winning album "The Mosaic Project," a collaboration headed by jazz composer Terri Lyne Carrington.
Rose has also made a name for herself outside of music. She leads the social initiative My Angel Wears a Fro, which is primarily concerned with youth empowerment.
If you're thinking about swinging by the Eliot courtyard, as Rose says, "Here's a ticket boy. Go stand in line."

In early 2007, at the unveiling of her statue at Westminster, Margaret Thatcher remarked, “I might have preferred Iron. But bronze will do. It won't rust.” True to form, her memory will continue to inspire long after she is passed.
Margaret Roberts was the daughter of a grocery clerk. She studied chemistry at Oxford, and she would later work to give the world the first of her many contributions: soft-serve ice cream. After marrying and having twins, the new Mrs. Thatcher trained as a tax attorney. However, I write not about Thatcher the student, the chemist, the attorney, or the mother, but, of course, Thatcher the prime minister.
The Britain Thatcher inherited in 1979 was in disrepair. Unemployment was exploding and inflation crippled the economy. Union strikes wreaked havoc and just plain reeked as weeks worth of garbage collected in the streets. This was Britain’s infamous “winter of discontent.”
Yet glorious summer would be long in the making. In order to strangle stagflation, Thatcher held tight to her monetarist guns, refusing to inflate the money supply and reducing government spending as a share of GDP. This meant unemployment hit uncomfortable highs, and social unrest erupted into all-out vilification of the prime minister.
During those years of double-digit unemployment, Thatcher certainly gave comedians, satirists, and journalists a lucrative job. She served as fodder for endless routines on “Thatcher the milk snatcher.” A comedian joked, “It was great when she became Lady Thatcher, because then she sounded like a device for removing pubic hair.” One British headline stooped so low as to read, “Is Margaret Thatcher a Woman?”
Indira Gandhi and Golda Meir preceded Thatcher as female national leaders. However, neither was subjected to the utterly contemptible British tabloid treatment—perhaps a shade more civilized than tarring and feathering. People remember the routines. They forget unemployment declined to under seven percent again, GDP rose, and inflation fell.
What was Margaret Thatcher’s response to the attacks on her appearance, her family, and her sexuality? She coolly replied, “I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, well, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left.”
These attacks culminated in an assassination attempt in 1984. A member of an Irish terrorist group planted a bomb in the prime minister’s hotel room. At 3 a.m. the blast killed five Conservative members and injured 31. Thatcher, who was up working on her speech, narrowly escaped. Six hours later, she delivered her speech on time.
Despite the burnt effigies, the personal attacks, the vicious British tabloids, and even an assassination attempt, she was re-elected. Public disapproval was vociferous but largely superficial. Megaphones are louder than bank statements, and protests more impressive than GDP growth. She won because she divided her opponents. They were so completely caught off guard by this tour de force, she smashed the general election, leaving her opponents scattered in all different directions. In fact, Thatcher won with the largest margin of victory since 1945.
By 1990, the end of her tenure, Thatcher had strangled stagflation, led the West to win the Cold War, won back the Falkland Islands, and was the most despised woman in England. Britain was not kind to Thatcher, though history will be.
Thatcher held an awe-inspiring outlook on the caliber and capacity of human willpower. For Thatcher, each person was the author of his or her own unfinished autobiography. As a female chemist-turned-tax-attorney-turned-Conservative-prime-minister of England, all with the time to raise twins, Margaret Thatcher was the embodiment of individual resolve.
She was capable not only of weathering her critics but also of championing them. Her nickname, “the Iron Lady,” was originally an insult from a Soviet official. A nickname she adopted gladly.
Margaret Thatcher is not known for being the first female prime minister of England. She is known for being the defining political figure of post-war Britain—who happened to be a woman.
In her old age, Lady Thatcher lost her life’s two greatest loves: her husband, Dennis, of 52 years, and her indefatigable capacity for reason. Then, on the morning of April 8, 2013, the world lost one of the greatest champions of freedom. And we are the worse off without her. However, the Iron Lady never belonged to us. She belongs now to the pages of history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
There are two major justifications for racial preferences in college admissions: that they diversify classes and level the playing field. In both respects, these preferences are disappointing.
 
Elite colleges argue that racial preferences are essential for class diversity, which enhances the education received by students graduating into a diverse world and creates a diverse elite. Harvard’s diversity has certainly enhanced my education.
 
These colleges claim they seek a student body that is “diverse in many ways,” yet in practice their admissions offices value race far more than any other diversity factor they consider. According to a 1997 study, a black applicant to an elite university received the equivalent of a 450-point boost on a 1600-point SAT score relative to an Asian applicant with the same credentials. Students from underrepresented states, though, receive a much smaller boost. Poor students may actually receive no boost. Only legacies and athletes receive boosts on par with those conferred by race.
 
Does this system properly promote diversity? Consider this: According to “The Shape of the River,” a 1998 book co-written by former Harvard president Derek C. Bok, 86 percent of black students at a group of 28 selective schools were middle or upper class. Would anyone dispute that a poor white or Asian applicant would bring at least as much diversity to a very wealthy campus as a well-off black applicant?
 
Outside the courtroom, many supporters of racial preferences also argue that they level the playing field.
 
Yet the educational disadvantages of class are now larger than those of race. The white-black test score gap used to be twice as large as the rich-poor test score gap; that relationship has flipped. Whites are twice as likely to obtain a bachelor’s degree as blacks, but students from educated affluent families are seven times as likely to graduate as students from uneducated poor families. Holding race constant, suffering from a range of socioeconomic disadvantages lowers math and verbal SAT scores by 399 points, on average. Holding socioeconomic disadvantage constant, black students score 56 points lower than white students, on average.
 
Race still matters in America. In realtor offices, banks, schools, courtrooms, and workplaces, there is evidence that blacks face systematic discrimination that cannot be explained by income. Being poor, furthermore, disadvantages black students more than white students.
 
Yet researchers have also found that after accounting for blacks’ lower average parental incomes and wealth levels, the black-white employment and earnings gaps nearly disappear, and, according to the book “Being Black, Living in the Red: Race, Wealth, and Social Policy in America,” blacks in fact tend to graduate high school at higher rates than whites.
 
Reconciling these findings is difficult, but it seems safe to estimate that for college applicants, poverty is a larger disadvantage than race. Affirmative action, therefore, undercompensates for economic disadvantage and overcompensates for racial disadvantage, at least when considering educational opportunities.
 
Racial preferences also entail steep and unique costs.
 
They stigmatize minorities. “26% of whites and 37% of blacks say that most people attribute minorities’ successes in business and education to racial preferences, rather than their own skills and abilities,” the Pew Research Center found. Racism is surely behind some doubt of minorities’ achievements, but it is tragic that excessive racial preferences, by lowering admissions standards for minorities, provide rationalization for such doubts, which then are used as evidence that the preferences are still necessary.
 
Based on last semester’s controversy on affirmative action, many will dispute that racial preferences involve “lowering admissions standards” for minorities.
 
Some say that racial preferences simply take into account the disadvantage overcome by minority applicants. But the research cited above shows that most of that disadvantage is economic, not racial, and that racial preferences currently overcompensate for racial educational disadvantage. Furthermore, most minorities benefitting from racial preferences are not particularly economically disadvantaged.
 
Others say that an applicant’s minority status is itself a contribution to the Harvard community. True enough, but no one is responsible for being a certain race. Excessive race preferences, therefore, lower the bar of what applicants must accomplish by themselves to gain admittance, like any excessive preferences do.
 
Still others argue that standardized tests are racially biased, a claim challenged by the College Board.  It is unlikely, however, that such bias would be significant enough to merit the magnitude of today’s racial preferences, since white students scored, on average, 100 points higher  than their black counterparts.
 
This lower bar stokes racial tension. Some whites now believe, accurately or not, that they have replaced blacks as the primary victims of racial discrimination in America. Racial preferences arguably divide us more than they unite us.
 
In 1964 Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote, “It is a simple matter of justice that America, in dealing creatively with the task of raising the Negro from backwardness, should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor.” Fifty years later, affirmative action is failing to raise the poor, both black and white.
 
To truly level the playing field, we need to reweight racial and socioeconomic admissions preferences to reflect their relative contributions to educational disadvantage. Race-neutral criteria could preserve significant racial diversity. We should also scrutinize legacy and athletic preferences.
Affirmative action, however, is one of society’s least effective and most costly equalizers. We should instead pursue aggressive social initiatives, like education reform, increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit, and improving job training. Every poor American, regardless of skin color, deserves a fairer chance at success.

Just a week after Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 will have returned to Cambridge to encourage female students to “lean in” to their careers, the rapper Tyga will tell them to bend over.
Tyga was the performer chosen by the Harvard College Events Board to headline this year’s Yardfest. Harvard undergraduates haven’t wasted the opportunity for a good protest. For once, it’s not for sport.
On the surface, Harvard is the epitome of academic and social enlightenment, helping to alleviate inequality of opportunity and allowing individuals to advance on their merits. Tyga’s booking demonstrates a disparity between this projection and reality—even those firmly committed to women’s advancement find themselves in a sticky spot when trying to deal with pop culture.
Though Tyga is best known for his hit “Rack City,” he’s also contributed poetic gems like “Lap Dance” and “Make It Nasty.” In “Bitch Betta Have My Money,” Tyga says, “Shut the fuck up and jump on this dick. Nothing but a motherfucking skank. Fuck what you talking ‘bout and fuck what you think.” In “Bitches Ain’t Shit” he raps, “Need a bitch that can fuck, cook, clean, right.” An online petition against Tyga’s Yardfest appearance that cites these lyrics has received nearly 2,000 signatures.
Some students have argued that Tyga’s detractors are overreacting, taking themselves (and life) too seriously. It’s very hard, in any debate, to prove that you’re not overreacting—the more you try to demonstrate the opposite, the surer your critics become. This sort of criticism—directed not at content, but at tenor and presentation—is frequently leveled at women. We often try to power through: “I sound mad? You bet I’m mad!”
But I do like Tyga’s music. Music like his only sells (well, is downloaded for free) because people like it. It’s not hard to see why. At least part of the allure of rap, misogynistic or not, is its open celebration of the self; listeners can be vicariously irreverent. (The other part of rap’s allure is its catchy beats.)
The trouble is that, all too often, rappers like Tyga gain at the expense of women. Their worth is measured in the size of their harems, their efficacy in the sexual deeds they perform.
In her book “Lean In,” Sandberg alludes to the trade-off women face between success and likability. Tyga highlights this problem. It’s hard to protest—to ask to be taken seriously, not seen as a collection of secondary sex characteristics—without ruining everyone’s fun.
And so we lead double lives. We debate the nature of feminist “strategy”: Is it mostly Sandberg’s ambition gap? Are policies and attitudes the problem, as Anne-Marie Slaughter has argued? But beneath the surface, the debate’s premise—that women should advance professionally—is under constant threat of erosion from the current of popular culture.
It seems unlikely that “grinding” to Tyga replaced “twisting” to Chubby Checker because girls wanted it to. We women—hoping to please and not to disrupt—comply with men’s (admittedly, not all men’s) definition of what is fun and cool. That female objectification is such a stubborn fixture on the cultural landscape provides all the more reason that Harvard should attempt to dislodge it. Given that we’re pulled in so many directions, it is hard to be a woman. Harvard, of all places, should not make it harder.
A friend of mine once joked that sexism, misogyny, and rape are “women’s issues,” like violence and murder are “dead people’s issues.” But the joke underscores a sad truth: For men, sexism is usually an intellectual exercise. For me, at least, arguing for feminist causes can feel like burdening others with my problems. Protesting Tyga feels like complaining. And that’s the last thing I want. I (and, I think, most college –aged women) want you to think I take everything in stride. I want you to like me.
It may take nuance for me to make it professionally: To be assertive without seeming “pushy,” feminine but also practical and reasonable. I don’t ask for any special favors (though my birthday is coming up soon if you find a nice skirt with pockets).
I don’t ask that Tyga’s freedom of expression be curtailed. I may disapprove of what he has to say, but I will defend to the death his right to rap it to the tune of a forgotten one-hit-wonder.
All I ask is that Harvard not use my tuition money to pay Mr. Tyga (I hope it’s all right if I call him that) to call me a bitch.

For a few years now, George Orwell’s novels have been available on e-readers. But the next time you pick up a tablet, “1984” might not just be on the screen—it might be coming through it as well.
Developed by a tech start-up and owned by a consortium of major publishing houses, a new program, CourseSmart, empowers professors to track how much of the assigned reading individual students have completed and the manner in which they have moved through the material, generating indexes that measure student engagement and acuity. Already introduced at Texas A&M, the software will be rolled out next year at several universities nationwide. Feted by some educators as a next generation learning tool, CourseSmart simultaneously raises questions about paternalism and responsibility.
We do not oppose technological advances in the educational sphere, and we can envision many worthwhile applications for this technology. It would allow teachers to give their students more personalized, nuanced advice, highlighting areas for improvement that would hitherto go unnoticed. It would lead to better academic intervention, notifying teachers before students’ problematic trend-lines turned into bad test grades. Besides casting light on individual performance, the program would also inform teachers’ whether their class pacing and homework assignments are appropriate. The software should certainly be tested in high schools, where it might prove hugely beneficial.
College, however, is different than what comes before. Gone are the days of parental nagging and homework checks. In the past are the handholding teachers. One must begin to assume the responsibilities of adulthood. Academic support is still needed and appreciated. But one must seek out these services and identify one’s own troubles. Additionally, as we grow up we form our own study patterns. Perhaps some can get along with a quick treatment of the course packet. And that choice, if effective, should be respected. If a student needs a fancy computer program to tell him that he is not doing the reading or studying hard enough, that is a problem of its own.
While we do not endorse the adoption of CourseSmart in college, we think it imperative that universities and high schools incorporating the software into instruction share the data they collect with students, and in high school, with parents as well. This is in line with CourseSmart’s support of accountability and productive learning behaviors. Just as importantly, this would grant us a glance behind the screen, an opportunity to steal a glimpse of a kinder, though still creepy, form of Big Brother.

This is the eighth instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.
For Catholics, Joy in Continuity
It is important to remember that a new pope is not at all like a new president.  The election of a new president generally means a transfer of power from one faction to another and portends changes to and reversals of the policies of the previous administration.  However, the pope, as the Vicar, or representative, of Christ, is very different from a president.  Rather than an executive charged with making policy decisions, he is the caretaker of eternal truths.  If anything, a new pope is more like a new secretary of state or chief of staff within the same administration.  It is an important office, to be sure, but the overarching philosophy, goals, and mission are coming from higher up the ranks.
As such, Pope Francis, like all 265 of the popes who preceded him, will not teach anything contrary to the Church’s beliefs on matters of faith and morals.  This continuity should itself be a source of great joy to Catholics, for these teachings are beautiful and even liberating.  What he can do, and what we pray that he will do, is inspire the whole world, by his words, leadership, and example, to embrace the truths of the Gospel and the person of Jesus Christ.  Thus far the Holy Father has certainly gotten the world’s attention; we pray that over the course of his papacy, he will be so compelling as to strengthen the Church and bring more and more people into its fold.

He's the Pope—Not Superman
I’m 18 years old. Female. Pro-choice. Pro-gay marriage. And Catholic.
Can you guess which of these items doesn’t belong with the others?
As a new pope assumes leadership of the Vatican, the media outlets and pundits have turned their attention to Catholicism, asking what changes we can expect of the man formerly known as Jorge Mario Bergoglio. Much has been made of his Argentine origin, his membership in the Jesuit order, and his “human touch.” New York Times reporter Rachel Donadio has made the assertion that the papacy is “an ancient institution where style often translates into substance”; in that same article, she made sure to note the pope’s “humble black shoes” and “ordinary wristwatch.”
I certainly agree with Donadio that Pope Francis draws a stark contrast with his predecessor, who was dour and fond of ornamentation.  But while acknowledging the change in style, I hesitate to predict a change in substance. Pope Francis has shown little desire to act on the major controversies within the faith today—the issues of female clergy and gay marriage. It appears that like millions of other Catholics, he sincerely believes the Church adages that gay marriage and female clergy are against God’s will. And so, for the time being, the options for us more unsure Catholics seem to be defection or conformity.
Centuries have passed since the Middle Ages, but, when it comes to issues like female clergy and gay marriage, the Church still resembles its authoritarian former self. Where the modern era emphasizes curiosity and scientific reasoning, the modern Catholic Church remains committed to tradition and dogma. In short, there is a clash of personalities between the Church and its modern adherents.
And I doubt any pope will dare an attempt at fixing it.
Sonali Y. Salgado ’16, a Crimson news writer, lives in Thayer Hall.
 
 
A People’s Pope
On March 13, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected Pope of the Catholic Church. As the first member of the Society of Jesus, one of the Roman Catholic Church’s more liberal religious orders, his rise will lead to significant changes to the conservative policies favored by Pope Benedict XVI. Yet as with any secretive institution, these reforms will take time and will be limited on several fronts.
Religious orders within the Catholic Church significantly influence the ways in which this institution’s leadership and officials view and interpret dogma. Pope Benedict XVI was a member of the Opus Dei, a religious order characterized by its desire to preserve Catholic traditions to the letter. On the other hand, Jesuits, or members of the Society of Jesus, such as Pope Francis, are known for the high value they place on education and their worldliness and desire to integrate themselves with the communities they serve.
Pope Francis has already shown signs of advancing the Jesuits’ worldview. From the moment he first addressed the world, Pope Francis challenged age-old Catholic tradition by wearing his own iron cross and white robes, in place of the traditional ornate robes and golden crosses that went along with the Papacy. His subsequent actions have paved the way for the transformation of the Catholic Church into an organization that will seek to forge direct connections with its followers. For example, he washed the feet of a dozen inmates at a juvenile detention center on Holy Thursday and kissed the feet of two women––an Italian Catholic and a Serbian Muslim. These actions may seem trivial, but they are undertaken by a man leading one of the most powerful and secretive organizations in the world, and thus they carry a great deal of symbolic weight with them.
However, despite the reform that Pope Francis’ papacy will inaugurate, there will still be significant limitations. We should expect the Church to do away with its overt displays of wealth and in its place begin to give poverty and social justice more importance than they were accorded in the past. However, we should not expect to see female priests or a Catholic Church without celibacy as a requirement to priesthood.

An Absolute Monarch?
Last Sunday, Pope Francis brought his pontificate’s inaugural festivities to a close at Rome’s cathedral church, St. John Lateran. Francis had assumed the office of pope and all its attendant powers upon accepting his election last month. However, only his enthronement in the cathedra—a bishop’s ceremonial chair—completed the symbolism of what had happened on March 13. The Chair of St. Peter is no longer empty. The Church of Rome once again has a bishop.
On the same occasion eight years ago, Francis’ predecessor made some trenchant remarks about the papacy’s powers—and, even more, about its limitations. Though seated upon the Lateran Basilica’s marble throne, the most potent symbol of papal authority, Benedict rejected the notion that the pope is “an absolute monarch whose thoughts and desires are law.” Rather, he continued, “the pope’s ministry is a guarantee of obedience to Christ and to His Word. He must not proclaim his own ideas but rather constantly bind himself and the Church to obedience to God’s Word, in the face of every attempt to adapt it or water it down.”
Any genuine call for reform in the Church must take this into account—which is not to say that reform is out of the question. The pope can, should, and probably will restructure the Roman Curia, that is, the Vatican bureaucracy. The pope can, should, and probably will promulgate stricter norms to keep children safe from abusive priests. The pope can and does allow married men to be ordained priests, if only on a limited scale, though he probably should not and will not broaden this. What the pope cannot and will not do, however, is to alter the Church’s dogmas. It is not the pope’s job to change those doctrines of the Church with which the world is ill at ease. On the contrary, it is the pope’s duty is to hand down to future generations the teachings he received from his predecessors—and ultimately from Christ Himself.

Service and Humility: A New Direction for the Catholic Church
Pope Francis has already brought incredible change to the Papal office, and no one can deny that he is going to dramatically change the global message of the Catholic Church. He is the first Jesuit pope and the first pope to take the name of the famous St. Francis of Assisi, the first this millennium not to take a previously used name. He is famous for his service to the poor, the first to live in the Vatican’s guest house instead of the Apostolic Palace, and the first pope to wash the feet of a woman—and a Muslim woman at that. He even has a master’s degree in chemistry (although I’d love to hear his thoughts on transubstantiation). He has rejected the ornate papal throne in favor of a simple stone chair and appears only in his white friar’s robes and skullcap, without the iconic “Pope’s hat,” or the scepter, ornate red robes, and red Prada shoes that defined his predecessor’s fashion style. He has stated, “How I would like a poor Church, and for the poor.”
Although Pope Francis is most widely known for his consistent advocacy for the poor, he is also relatively progressive in comparison to other cardinals. This may be a low bar, but it’s certainly worth something. He has washed the feet of AIDS patients and has commented that celibacy for priests “is a matter of discipline, not faith. It can change.” It should be noted that he has not announced an agenda to change this yet. In addition, he has made a name for himself as a proponent of interfaith dialogue. Protestant, Muslim, and Jewish leaders have all spoken to his capacity for human kindness and his humble, respectful tone.
With everything that Pope Francis has already done, even if his lifetime is insufficient to tackle the ungodly mess of politics, fraud, and corruption that has entangled the Vatican, his very symbol and memory will resonate with people for centuries to come, and his name will be a rallying cry for those wishing to return the Church to its humble roots as a ministry of love and a servant of the needy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 members of the Harvard community rallied outside Massachusetts Hall on Thursday to deliver a petition calling for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels.
Divest Harvard, the group that organized the event, has collected over 1,300 signatures from students, faculty, and alumni since the movement began in September.
“The goal of today is to show President Faust and the Harvard Corporation that there is strong student support for divestment, and that the administration needs to take that support seriously,” said S. Krishnan Dasaratha ’13, one of the organizers of the event. “We hope that she or a member of the Corporation will accept our signatures and indicate willingness to have a conversation about divestment in good faith.”
Since February, Divest Harvard has met with the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, a committee consisting of four members of the Harvard Corporation that helps to determine the University's stance on matters related to social responsibility.
The Corporation has previously voted on issues regarding investment, including the decision to divest from tobacco manufacturing companies in 1989, as well as from companies involved in oil production in Sudan in 2005 and 2006.
However, the Corporation has maintained that it does not want to use divestment as a political tool. The University’s website for its Shareholder Responsibility Committees reiterates a statement from when the Corporation decided to divest from Sudanese oil.
“The University is first and foremost an academic institution,” the statement reads.
As indicated by a referendum on the Undergraduate Council election ballot in November, students have expressed their interest and concern about the issue,
UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said that 72 percent of the voters voiced their support for divestment.
During Thursday’s rally, protesters marched around Massachusetts Hall and chanted, “We are the movement! We want divestment! We will not stop, we have the power!”
David W. Keith, a professor of applied physics and of public policy, who also spoke at the rally, acknowledged the importance of divestment, but suggested alternative ways that students could help the environment. Keith recommended making the campus more sustainable, as well as cutting coal fuel emissions nationwide.
Many student protesters said that they came out to demonstrate the gravity of the issue.
“The choices we make in our lifetime are going to affect the human race profoundly for thousands of years,” said Benjamin Franta, a graduate student and co-coordinator for Divest Harvard. “It is not just an economic challenge; it is a moral challenge.”
At 4:37 p.m., Marc L. Goodheart ’81, secretary of the Harvard Corporation and University vice president, came out of Massachusetts Hall to collect the petition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The week after the Committee on Academic Integrity unveiled its proposal for a student honor code, several members of the faculty remained divided on whether the new code would foster a culture of greater academic integrity among the undergraduate body.
As proposed, the five-part honor code would create a judicial board populated by students and faculty to hear academic dishonesty cases. It would also require students to write a “declaration of integrity” statement on assignments and exams.
The proposal does not require students to report other students for violating the honor code, a point that drew criticism from some faculty.
“An honor code presupposes that everyone’s honor is affronted with one person’s violation,” government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 wrote in an email to The Crimson. “It won’t work unless everyone is expected to turn in a violator.”
Robert H. Bates, a professor of government and of African and African American Studies, questioned the fact that despite the institution of such an honor code, faculty would still proctor exams under the proposal.
“I think it doesn’t add up,” Bates said. “Either we are behaving honorably or cheating, and if we’re behaving honorably, why do we need faculty there? If we’re cheating and we need faculty there, then we don’t really have an honor code that’s working.”
Bates, however, said including students in the board that hears academic dishonesty cases is “definitely worth a try” because the disciplinary process might benefit from student voice.
Government professor Stephen D. Ansolabehere agreed that having students on the board would “probably be better for everybody involved.”
“My experience is that a lot of committees at the University level have student involvement, and that student involvement is really instructive and very constructive because it gives us a perspective of how the students see things,” Ansolabehere said.
But according to Mansfield, having students on the judicial board would actually allow administrators to share “responsibility for the dirty work of punishment.”
“Administrators like the idea because it shifts the burden onto others,” Mansfield wrote.
Mansfield also questioned whether an honor code is fully compatible with a campus culture that he says emphasizes “free choice.”
“Do Harvard students really know what their honor is?” Mansfield wrote. “With free choice a student is not responsible for other [people’s] choices. With honor, he or she is responsible.”
The proposal, Mansfield pointed out, mentions building a “culture of trust,” but not a culture of honor. With an “atmosphere of free choice,” Mansfield questioned how anyone could trust others’ choices.
Bates, too, differentiated between a culture of trust and a culture of honor that should be built.
“[It should be] a culture of honor,” Bates said, defining such a culture as “[placing] integrity above fear or above anxiety about getting into med school or law school, or about all those other things that lead people to make choices that lack integrity.”
Students have cautioned that the success of an honor code at Harvard would require a shift in campus culture regarding academic integrity, a sentiment Bates echoed.
Bates noted that though the initial drafting was a step in the right direction, there would need to be a shift in students’ attitudes for the honor code to succeed.
“There’s the next step, which is getting a lot of very dynamic and ambitious people with very high expectations for themselves, where grades mean so much about their future and where academics is something that doesn’t really lie at the core, I think, of undergraduate life...all that has to be reshaped,” Bates said.

Recognizing how current social attitudes toward rape have come into being will help students dismantle a rape culture that places undue burden on victims, according to Tithi Bhattacharya, an associate professor at Purdue University who spoke at Dudley House Thursday evening.
“The term rape culture implies that there is something systemic,” Bhattacharya said in her talk, entitled “From Steubenville to Harvard: Understanding Rape Culture and Fighting Against It.”
She unpacked these systemic problems into three main factors: selective coverage of rape cases by the media, a tendency for society to place the burden of responsibility on rape victims rather than perpetrators, and the use of comedy to trivialize the act of sexual assault.
Bhattacharya said that people are expected to “lighten up” and laugh at jokes about rape, a mindset she finds incongruous. Humor—a tool often used to critique social systems—“is being turned around in order to attack the people that most suffer under the system,” she said.
The talk, which was sponsored by the Harvard Socialists, the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective, and the Harvard Student Labor Action Movement, follows on the heels of a number of local and international sexual assault and rape cases that have sparked debate over media coverage and rape culture amongst youth.
Twenty to 25 percent of women will be raped during their college career. As a result, potential victims of rape—mainly women—are taught strategies to avoid getting raped: stay away from dangerous situations, avoid alcohol at parties, and stay with friends at all times. But lost in this dialogue, Bhattacharya said, is an effort to teach offenders about consensual sex and taking responsibility for their actions.
“Rape culture is not pervasive but it is sure as hell institutional,” Bhattacharya said.
Amanda Haziz-Ginsberg, an organizer of the Harvard Socialist Club, helped arrange the event tonight “in the hopes of continuing a conversation about rape culture.”
“I think the meeting demonstrated that people are beginning to think seriously about the systemic roots of rape culture in U.S. society, as well as the formation of a new movement to fight against it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent assignment for her sophomore tutorial, African and African American Studies concentrator Yasmin Rawlins ’15 trekked to Merengue, a Dominican restaurant in Roxbury, to interview the owners.
Her conversation—which will contribute to a multimedia-based final project on the relationship between nutrition, cuisine, and culture—is part of the Social Engagement Initiative, an effort to incorporate on-the-ground research into the AAAS curriculum.
“[Students] go to Dorchester, or Roxbury, or Mattapan, and they maybe meet a Cape Verdean educator or a singer...an Ethiopian priest...a Dominican restaurant owner,” said Carla D. Martin ’03, a College Fellow on AAAS who teaches the sophomore tutorial.
After reaching out to members of African and African American communities in the greater Boston area, students will compile the ethnographic information they collect into a “social portrait” that Martin characterized as a “mini-documentary of these local communities.”
The Social Engagement Initiative has been expanding since 2010, when some AAAS seniors first wrote their theses on original projects in African and African American communities. Both the sophomore tutorial and AAAS 20: “Introduction to African Languages and Cultures,” taught in the fall by AAAS professor John M. Mugane, were offered as social engagement courses for the first time this year.
“That was my goal, to combine academic work with work on the ground,” said AAAS chair Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, who considers the Initiative her personal contribution to the department.
“Social engagement says that what you learn in anthropology, what you learn in history, you can actually take that very knowledge and through projects in communities come to understand whether what you’re learning in the classroom is affirmed, is challenged, or even refuted.”
Students in the sophomore tutorial will use their findings to update Wikipedia articles on the African diaspora, construct custom Google Maps that chart out major community sites, and create an online resource guide with commentary on each of the books and articles used in their research.
“The world is changing in terms of the new technology and the way people are reading news and learning about things and connecting with each other,” said Rawlins. “So things like the internet and media are all really wonderful tools that I think will be really important in the future and that we have already started using in the present.”
According to Mugane, social engagement “brings Africans back where they should belong: the center of the study.”
Rawlins said that the Initiative was one of the factors that motivated her to concentrate in AAAS.
“It gets you out in the community, it gets you engaging with people on a hands-on basis,” she said.
Fellow concentrators agreed that the effort is a refreshing change from social science curricula that are often too theoretical.
“Hopefully it can be implemented in other departments as well,” said AAAS concentrator Ralph A. Hunt ’15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first admissions cycle since the Government 1310 cheating scandal, applicants to Harvard College who had cheated in high school faced no increased scrutiny, a Harvard spokesperson confirmed Thursday.
Applicants to the Class of 2017 whose transcripts indicated a history of academic dishonesty were subject to the same evaluation process as similar applicants in previous years, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal. That evaluation process is designed to give some accused cheaters a fair chance of admission, while still considering the gravity of the infraction, depending on the details of their case, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview last month.
“We would listen to what the student has said. We also would listen carefully to what was in the reports from the school, and we would try to make a judgment,” Fitzsimmons said.
He added that in the wake of the cheating scandal there are “no changes anticipated” in the way Harvard looks at these applicants.
While he said that it is “not particularly common” for students with records of academic dishonesty to apply to Harvard, Fitzsimmons said that sometimes these students are able to rebound from the incident.
“If something happened early in one’s high school or middle school career, and it was really clear from the student and from the school that the person learned a great deal from the experience, in some cases, [that student] may in fact be better equipped when they get to college,” he said.
Fitzsimmons said that it has always been a priority of the admissions committee to take seriously violations of academic integrity.
“We’ve been as careful as anyone can be over the years, simply because character and personal qualities and integrity are so important in every admissions case,” he said.
But while Harvard seeks to carefully consider applications indicating a history of academic dishonesty, college admissions consultants interviewed for this article said in the absence of these marks, there is little Harvard can do to identify potential cheaters.
Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, said that Harvard is often at the mercy of high school counselors, who do not always report academic dishonesty cases on students’ transcripts.
“It’s fairly common knowledge that less serious infractions don’t always make it onto the official record,” Ivey said. “There is really only so much that the admissions officers can do aside from encouraging the high schools to disclose the things that need to be disclosed.”
Zachary Bills, director of college admissions at consulting firm Top Test Prep, said he believes that even if Harvard’s admissions committee were to increase its scrutiny of applicants, it would be difficult to accurately judge a student’s character.
“I’m not certain that they’re going to find anything, or they have a real metric with which to judge if this person is more likely to cheat once they get to Harvard,” Bills said.
Fitzsimmons acknowledged these limitations, saying that Harvard can do “nothing other than observing what we have in the application and going from there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (16-8, 9-4 EIVA) improved its postseason outlook this weekend, beating conference rivals New Jersey Institute of Technology (7-9, 4-8) and Rutgers-Newark (4-19, 0-12) at home on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
The Crimson clinched a postseason appearance in the EIVA tournament last week with a win over Princeton, making these conference games important in terms of seeding. The top four teams in the EIVA make the tournament and Harvard is ranked fourth and heading towards a difficult matchup with defending EIVA champion Penn State in the first round.
However if Harvard can win next week against Sacred Heart, and third-seeded Princeton loses to second-seeded George Mason, then the Crimson will move into third place and challenge George Mason in the first round.
“We are playing for seeding at this point,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “But just as important as that is trying to secure some momentum going into the first round.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 0
Coming off a difficult match against NJIT, the Crimson came out determined to prove itself against a much maligned Rutgers-Newark team.
Harvard was led by dominant hitting performances from juniors Kyle Rehkemper, Will Chambers, and Nick Madden, who each finished with eight kills.
The team jumped out to an early lead in each of the three games and never allowed the Scarlet Raiders to close the gap.
In the first set, the Crimson jumped out to a 10-4 lead and eventually won, 25-14. Throughout the first game, the Crimson never trailed and its hitters posted a kill percentage of .542 while holding Rutgers-Newark to .273.
Harvard did not let up in the second set, securing a 7-3 lead after scoring five straight points and then coasting to a 25-18 victory.
While the Crimson hit a little worse in the game—.391, still well above its season average of .261—it dominated defensively, holding the Scarlet Raiders to a percentage of -.033 with five blocks.
In the third set, it appeared initially like Harvard was going to be challenged far more than previously by Rutgers-Newark as two straight Scarlet Raider points cut the Crimson’s lead to 9-8.
But from there, it was all Harvard. The Crimson went on a 10-2 run to gain a decisive lead and eventually win, 25-12.
Overall, Harvard notched a kill percentage of .490 while limiting Rutgers-Newark to .120, propelling the Crimson to an easy victory.
HARVARD 3, NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 2
Friday night was a far tougher match for Harvard, as it was forced to play conference foe New Jersey Institute of Technology in a tie-breaking fifth game. But the squad suddenly turned it on at the end of the contest, seizing a victory, 3-2, with comebacks in both the overall match and individual games.
“It wasn’t how we wanted it to happen,” Baise said. “We were playing sloppy but we gained some momentum and came back.”
After dropping the first two sets, the Crimson suddenly picked up its game to take the next two stanzas and go into the fifth tied with the Highlanders.
Then, in the last set, Harvard went down early, 7-4, but rallied again, tying the score with three straight points. The teams then traded points until NJIT gained some distance at 14-12.
But the Crimson fought back again. The team scored on two straight match-points to tie the game, and eventually went ahead to win, 17-15.
After the first game ended in defeat, Baise only played several of his starters sparingly for the rest of the match. The team’s struggles continued into the second, which they lost by a wide margin.
But in the third set, Harvard abruptly found its game. After the Crimson secured an early lead, both teams traded points until Harvard went on a strong run to claim a 17-11 lead.
The Highlanders rallied back to 22-20, but it was not enough, and the Crimson eventually came out with its first win of the match, 25-22, to bring the overall count to 2-1.
“We had some different guys come in and do big things for us,” Baise said. “[Freshman outside hitter] Alec Schlossman and [junior outside hitter] Michael Owen really gave us a boost tonight.”
The fourth game went back and forth, with neither team able to maintain a sizeable lead until Harvard managed to earn a 25-23 victory and push the match into the fifth set, where it eventually won, taking both the game and the match.
“[NJIT] is really good and hustles on every play,” Owen said. “They really made us earn it, but we were able to focus up and concentrate on the little things to get it done.”

Call the Winklevoss twins "craggy" and "Neanderthal-esque" or "aggressively aristocratic" if you'd like... but don't accuse them of failing to learn from their mistakes.
 The Winklevosses are in the news once again, and this time we've learned that they're heavily invested in an internet technology that's definitely not Facebook. The New York Times reported yesterday that the twins own "one of the single largest portfolios" of bitcoins, a digital form of currency.
A primer for the uninitiated: First launched in 2009, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency that operates independently of any governmental regulation. Because they are heavily encrypted and accessible only using private keys, bitcoins are one of the most anonymous methods available for conducting transactions. You might even call Bitcoin an anti-social network, which probably makes sense as an investment for these guys since their track record with actual social networks isn't the best.
All of this secrecy stands in stark contrast to the twins' earliest (attempted) investment, especially this week, as Facebook rolled out more detailed status update capabilities, allowing users to share what they're eating, drinking, reading, listening to, watching, and feeling.
However, there's one aspect of bitcoins that the Winklevosses should be aware of going forward. As the Times article notes, "[L]ittle is known about the creator of bitcoin, or if it even was a single person."
If the Winklevii were the inventors of Bitcoin, they would have invented Bitcoin, right? Actually, that might hit a little too close to home. Sorry, guys.

April 13, 1946: 8 O'Clock Curfew For Lady Guests Asked by Council
Extension of visiting hours for woman guests in all Houses until 8 o'clock was recommended as a change in the Parietal Regulations by the Student Council in their Thursday meeting. In addition, the Council proposed that on nights of open House dances late privileges be extended to members of other Houses planning to attend the dance.
Such a change, if accepted, would be the first enacted since June of 1941 when the present "Oxford card system" was introduced in the Houses. This system provided that each member of the House be permitted to sign his own guests in and out although the hour of departure remained 7 o'clock as previously. It was no longer necessary to have the presence of a third person, but as at present the system affected only those living in the Houses.
April 10, 1953: Radcliffe Employment Office Seks Perfume Sellers and Dog Walkers
For obtaining a dog-walker, a perfume smeller, or even a baby-sitter, the hope of Boston employers is the Radcliffe Employment Bureau. In the past three years, the Bureau, headed by Mrs. Mary Shaw, has been filling such requests from her file-jammed office on the second floor of Fay House, in the Radcliffe Quad.
The "perfume smeller" was requested by a manufacturer who wanted a girl to dispense perfume samples and describe the customers' reactions. For every vial of perfume given away, the girl received twenty-five cents. She was then asked to describe her preference among the varieties she had distributed.
Another employer asked for a Radcliffe girl to make purchases in a department store (money supplied by the store) and write about the transaction--quality of service, appearance of the display, and the purchase itself.

April 9, 1969: Students Occupy University Hall, Eject Deans, Staff from Offices
Shortly after noon today, more than 100 demonstrators occupied University Hall. As of 6 p.m., the demonstrators numbering 200—down from 350 at 4 p.m.—were still holding the building.
The demonstrators ejected all Administration officials and staff members from the hall, early in the afternoon, some by force.
Before leaving peacefully at 12:50, Dean Glimp several times told the demonstrators that their continued presence in the hall would subject them to disciplinary action. "You are obstructing the movement of individuals in this building. This alone merits disciplinary action. Furthermore, I am now instructing you to get out of here," Glimp said.
April 12, 1985: 'The Sport of Kings' Returns to Harvard
While the mention of the sport "polo" may connote English country houses, aristocratic pleasantries and Ralph Lauren, a group of diehard polo enthusiasts is seeking to alter that image at Harvard.
So, after a lapse of five years, the Harvard Polo Club will return to campus, doing its best to convince undergraduates that polo is the sport of the people. "I fear very much that the elitist image will cause anger at Harvard," said Amir Farman-Farma '86, one of the cofounders of the new club. "But, we are attracted to the sport and its competitive spirit and discipline, divorced from any social connotations."

UPDATED: April 13, 2013, at 12:03 p.m.
With reading period just a few weeks away, Harvard students are busy preparing (or busy thinking about how they should be preparing) for the upcoming end of the semester. Yale students, meanwhile, work toward the end of the spring term with the knowledge that their grading system could undergo radical changes in the very near future.
Last week, after student protests, Yale faculty voted to table a proposal that would dramatically change Yale's grading distribution and scale.If the measure were to pass when it is voted on next fall, Yale would adopt a 100-point grading scale in place of the traditional 4.0, as well as a set of suggested guidelines for grade distribution (35 percent of grades would be between a 90 and 100, 40 percent between 80 to 89, 20 percent between 70 and 79, and so on). The proposal is partly aimed at addressing grade inflation.
Yale isn't the only Ivy League school to address this issue—in 2004, Princeton passed a set of policies to curb grade inflation. Those who put the Princeton policy into place in 2004 expcected other peer institutions to follow suit, but so far that has not been the case. Still, as of 2012 there were no plans to get rid of grade deflation at Princeton.
It's unclear whether or not Yale's plan will work out in the fall—which would likely be a boon to Princeton's policy. We'll just have to see if Harvard gets any ideas.
