Harry Styles emerged from beneath the Coachella mainstage on Friday night like a vision. Dressed in a pink, all-leather cowboy get-up (complete with his initials emblazoned on the back of his pants), he stood center stage, basking in the applause from the hundreds of thousands of people gathered to watch him.
When the crowd finally fell silent, it was only for that silence to be broken by the guitar intro to “As It Was,” the synth-pop-inspired first look at Styles’ upcoming album, “Harry’s House.” The devoted audience quickly morphed into a screaming frenzy of excitement. Indeed, no other crowd on Friday came close to matching the energy of Styles’ audience.
Following “As It Was,” Styles kept up the energy with “Adore You” and “Golden,” two of the most popular tracks from his 2019 sophomore effort, “Fine Line.” He improvised a bit on these tracks, switching octaves and harmonizing differently than on his studio album in typical Styles fashion. Notably, “Golden” featured an extended guitar intro which allowed Styles to wind up the crowd before singing the fan-favorite track.
The most astounding part of the performance had to be Styles’ complete control of the stage. His confidence and sheer suave could convince even the staunchest critic that Styles is indeed an excellent performer. Not only were his dance moves smooth, slick, and sexy, but his facial expressions alone conveyed that the stage was his. As he ran his hands through his hair during “Golden,” he donned a cheeky grin which seemed to say, “I know you love me.”
Thanks to a catwalk which extended more than thirty yards into the crowd, Styles was able to engage more directly with those who didn’t get a spot at the front. (Those who did get the coveted barricade spots had been camped at the Coachella mainstage for hours prior to Styles’ performance.) He strutted down the stage, throwing his tiny pink cowboy hat into the crowd and splashing the audience with a jug of water and his signature “whale” move.
Although his stage presence was the highlight of the performance, his vocal range is not to be understated. During a performance of his new song “Boyfriends,” an as-yet unreleased track from “Harry’s House,” Styles demonstrated the true extent of his talent. Accompanied by an acoustic guitar and two backing vocalists from his band, Styles allowed his voice to shine through, navigating falsettos and sustaining chords like the seasoned singer he is. Furthermore, the folk style of the song shows his versatility as an artist  who refuses to be limited to simple definitions of rock or pop genres.
Following the surprise appearance of Shania Twain during weekend one, fans were left wondering all week long who would be brought out during the second half of the set. Following “Treat People With Kindness” — during which Styles brought a Black Lives Matter flag onto the stage — a woman’s voice began to sing Gloria Gaynor’s “I Will Survive.” At the edge of the catwalk, the spotlight turned to reveal pop and hip hop icon Lizzo donning a fuzzy fur coat to match Styles’ own.
The pair have an established relationship — Styles has covered Lizzo’s songs before, and their friendship is well documented — which made the Coachella collaboration all the more special. Together, Lizzo and Styles sang “I Will Survive” and, to the joy of longterm Styles fans (or, self-described “Harries”), One Direction’s smash-hit “What Makes You Beautiful.” In perhaps one of the most exciting moments of the show, Lizzo and Styles met in the center of the stage and harmonized the chorus of the latter, followed by a warm hug between the two. In tandem, Lizzo’s booming voice blended with Styles’ suave vocals and blew the audience away.
Other notable moments of the show include a rare and much-anticipated performance of Styles’ uber-popular unreleased track “Medicine,” a repeat performance of another not-yet-released song from “Harry’s House” titled “Late Night Talking” (it had its debut in weekend one of Coachella), and an extended performance of “Woman” from Styles’s 2017 self-titled album featuring a four-minute guitar solo.
For the encore, Styles performed one of his most famous ballads and the one that started it all, “Sign of the Times.” As the crowd sang in unison, Styles’ sang his heart out. The passion in his voice was undeniable as he belted out the vocals, allowing his raspy vibrato to shine through. With fireworks ablaze and lights flashing, Styles closed his set just as the Ukrainian flag lit up the LED screens behind him.
In addition to flawless execution of his set, Styles’ electrifying  stage presence led to a whirlwind of entertainment and emotion. He truly lived up to his status as the first headliner of the three-day festival.
With “Harry’s House” scheduled to release on May 20, Styles’ future is surely golden.

In 1993, Octavia Butler imagined the year 2024: There would be intense, apocalyptic climate change leading to the exploitation of workers, a massive refugee crisis, and major violent class disparities. A demagogue would rise to power touting “Christian values” and the slogan “make America great again.” Civil society would erode into chaos and violence in the streets of major U.S. cities. In 2022, Butler’s vision is eerily, terrifyingly prophetic. In light of this, “Parable of the Sower,” a reimagining of Butler’s masterpiece as a gospel-opera, written by Toshi Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon and performed at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre, sent a timely message of resistance and faith against a backdrop of a not-so-distant apocalypse.
One of the show’s main plotlines revolves around “Earthseed,” a religion invented by the main character Lauren Olamina (Marie Tatti) after she realized that the god of her father, Reverend Olamina (Jared Wayne Gladly), was not sufficient to carry her through the end of the world as she knows it. Aptly, the powerful proclamations of “Earthseed,” “All that you touch, you Change. All that you Change, Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change. God is Change,” were performed in a dynamic gospel musical style in the stage adaptation. The entire opera drew heavily on traditionally Black musical genres, including blues, jazz, and folk music, breathing life into a rich story populated by complex Black characters.
While Toshi Reagon and Bernice Johnson Reagon’s music and lyrics expertly reimagined Butler’s story, it is the actors’ passionate portrayals of the characters and superb musical talent that made the opera so immersive and emotional. Marie Tatti performed a forceful yet still youthful Lauren, and her soaring voice managed to convey prayer, anguish, passion, and confusion in equal turn. Josette Newsam, playing both Mrs. Sims and The Ancestor, filled the space with her stunning, clear vocals. And crucially for a show with little dialogue, Tatti and the rest of the cast effectively utilized body language and space to portray both Lauren’s unusual condition — she was afflicted with “hyperempathy,” a syndrome that causes victims to literally feel other peoples’ pain — and the broader dynamics of a community on the verge of collapse.
The set design, too, deftly complemented the narrative. A thin, gossamer curtain hangs over the scene, evoking the wall surrounding Lauren’s insular community and its fragility. On the metaphorical level, the wall represented how little actually separates those on the inside (the haves) from those on the outside (the have-nots). Desperate outsiders ripped down the wall halfway through the show, appropriately signifying a major turning point: The erosion of artificial class barriers, ordered society, and Lauren’s security.
“When the world’s on fire, what you gon’ do?” asked one of the early musical numbers. The show, in keeping with the book’s purpose, was intensely political and conscious of the present moment. Toshi Reagon — co-creator, co-composer, co-librettist, and musical director — sat in center stage on an elevated platform for the duration of the performance, contributing vocals and guitar, as well as occasionally interjecting to pay special homage to Butler’s original text and to bring “Parable of the Sower” into the context of 2022. The presence of the creator onstage, flanked by “The Talents” — two figures of Reagon’s own creation fashioned in the image of African goddesses — was a powerful statement of ownership over Butler’s story and the critique it makes of American society. The show stared unflinchingly at Butler’s imagined future’s modern-day doppelganger and demanded: What are we going to do?
With a two hour run time with no intermission and a relentless oeuvre of stunning music, the show might have proven overwhelming to the uninitiated viewer. For those unfamiliar with Octavia Butler’s “Parable of the Sower,” the plot and characters of this operatic adaptation might have seemed opaque and confusing. Only a handful of the characters onstage were explicitly named, and nearly everyone in the cast plays two characters. Additionally, some of the precocious inner thoughts of Lauren Olamina that complicate her personality were missing from the stage performance, and so was her unsettling relationship with Taylor Bankole (Toussaint Jeanlouis), which defines the second half of the novel. The opera, to put it simply, was not a mere adaptation but a complex artistic reimagining and should have been treated as such. Audience members needed to read the novel beforehand to be able to fully appreciate the care and genius the creators imbued in this performance.
Octavia Butler’s novel is an impressive, prophetic work of art that has only become more prescient in the decades since its publication. The reimagining of her work as a gospel-inspired opera is nothing short of inspired. The show breathes fresh air into the genre of opera while examining the intersections of race, gender, class, capitalism, climate change, and religion in a way that feels lucid and urgently important.

At exactly 10 p.m. the Coachella main stage lit up, and two massive animated horses galloped across the screens. As the crowd began to scream, Megan thee Stallion appeared at center-stage.
The opening piano melody to “Megan’s Piano” blasted through the speakers and immediately, Megan made the stage her own. Her background dancers performed high-energy hip hop routines as she rapped each word with notable precision. Despite the booming bass filtering in from the nearby stages, Megan’s enunciation cut through the white noise like a hot knife.
Revealing a costume change, Megan moved on to “Freak Nasty,” maintaining the same level of sexy intensity from the opener. Showing off her body and grinding on the  background dancers, she developed a great flow and managed to make the combination of dancing and rapping look effortless.
The highlight of her set was no doubt the performative choreography. Wearing high heels, her background dancers pranced all over the stage — twerking, jumping, and oftentimes performing acrobatic stunts. Megan, without losing breath or breaking her flow, danced in unison with the others on stage and took time to flirt with the audience using cheeky facial expressions.
During “Simon Says,” the screens lit up with the words “too loud, too Black, too sexy.” With that transition, Megan turned the venue into a space for Black joy and celebration. She called out to the crowd, “Where my hot girls at?” signifying that her performance served not just to showcase her confidence, but also to boost the confidence of her thousands of adoring fans.
The set continued with more playful, erotic tracks. Before “Sex Talk,” she freestyled a capella for thirty seconds, demonstrating her lyrical prowess and creativity. Then, during “Eat it,” a shirtless background dancer simulated the action[S] of oral sex [IDK Sofia Andrade], and she followed this up with a lap dance.
The highest intensity song of the set was easily “WAP.” As the iconic opening line rang throughout the venue, Megan confidently strutted to the front of the stage and prepared to blow the audience away. Megan joined the dancers for fiery choreography during Nicki Minaj’s verses, and the DJ turned the music down so that the crowd could sing the key line “I want you to touch that lil’ dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat.”
Near the end of the set, Megan performed her newest song “Plan B” which dropped on April 22. It featured heavy bass and a half-step melody in the background — overall a simple production. However, her flow was on-point, showing how her artistry is developing over time and proving that she deserved one of the headliner slots.
Following “Plan B,” Megan took a break and said to the crowd, “Y’all make me feel so mothafuckinggood. I hope me and my music make y’all feel mothafucking good.” With the wind blowing in her hair and the spotlight shining on her face, she truly appeared to be a queen standing on her throne.
Her set concluded with “Savage” and “Hot Girl Summer,” two of her most widely-known hits, ending the concert on a high. Her face lit up with a smile as she sang. Megan Thee Stallion’s charisma made it impossible to stand still, and the catchiness of the tracks facilitated the high-energy of the crowd.
The only thing missing from the performance was a guest feature. Speculations were on Cardi B, Dua Lipa, or even Denzel Curry. It’s perhaps unfair to expect a guest appearance from an artist, but it was certainly atypical for Megan to perform alone for the whole set as a headliner.
Despite this minor critique, Megan brought a sexy, playful energy to Saturday’s lineup that only she could provide. Coachella is known to be hot, but Megan made it even hotter.

April showers might bring May flowers in some parts of the world, but in sunny California, the fourth month of the year is marked by festival season. Festivities in the Golden State are already in full swing — the opening of Coachella on April 15 saw the arrival of musicians and the descent of social media influencers en masse, with ring lights and selfie sticks in tow. However, a recent flurry of complaints on social media suggests that Revolve Festival, one of the most exclusive events hosted adjacent to Coachella, not only failed to meet attendees’ expectations, but jeopardized their physical safety in a disaster of mismanagement.
Revolve Festival is one of various branded events adjacent to but not officially affiliated with Coachella itself, presumably organized to capitalize on the high social media traffic generated by Coachella’s six-day run. The annual event is hosted by the online fashion brand Revolve, and extends invitations to both major celebrities and “micro influencers.” This year, Revolve promised a blow-out event to mark its return after a three-year, pandemic-induced hiatus — complete with performances from the likes of Jack Harlow and Willow Smith, drinks provided by Kendall Jenner’s 818 Tequila, and a series of immersive social media installations produced in collaboration with partners Spotify and Venmo.
Unfortunately, what promised to be an influencer’s paradise — and reportedly cost some $2,000 to attend — shaped up to be a major disappointment to many attendees. While VIP guests such as Timothée Chalamet and Kim Kardashian were given the star treatment, many social media personalities reported being stranded in the hot, desert sun for hours on end as they waited for shuttle buses to bring them to the venue. In a video posted to her TikTok page, video creator Averie Bishop (@averiebishop) said that the transportation to the festival grounds was poorly organized, resulting in hours-long wait times and a chaotic process of “pushing, shoving, [and] shouting” as guests tried to board the shuttles. After a two-hour long wait, Bishop, an invited guest, never managed to make it to the event itself. Other invitees suffered a worse fate, with TikTok creator Hannah Kosh (@hannahkosh) saying that she witnessed “three people pass out in line” in a statement to Elle.
A TikTok video posted by user Madison Crowley (@madisoncrowleyphoto), who identified herself as a plus-one to the event, criticized the preferential treatment granted to major celebrities and influencers compared to other invitees. While Crowley waited in the parking lot for three hours with no access to water, she claimed that VIP guests were allowed to board the buses first. “That is the problem I have with Revolve — the preferential treatment of people who are supposed to be better and cooler than us when we were all invited to the festival,” Crowley said. Crowley also alleged that many influencers resorted to jumping over barriers and cutting lines in order to gain transport to the festival.
In response to the social media backlash, which led many on the internet to dub the event “Fyre Festival 2.0,” Revolve “sincerely” apologized to attendees, and attributed the chaotic conditions to concerns about Covid-19 safety. “As the festival was reaching capacity late Saturday afternoon, shuttle access to the venue was limited in order to remain in compliance with safety requirements causing longer wait times for entry and resulting in some guests not being able to attend the festival,” the fashion company said in a statement to E! News.
Whatever the explanation, Revolve will certainly have to heed Bishop’s advice and take into consideration “everyone’s safety and security next year.” As recent events have shown, influencers can and will point their cameras to illuminate issues and incompetency, and even the biggest brands had better watch out.

Last week, Lizzo graced the stage of “Saturday Night Live” as both a host and musical guest, where she revealed a new song, “Special.” Glittering in a pink gown, Lizzo delivered a breathtaking performance of the title track of her upcoming album set to drop on July 15. Even more important than simply being another song to listen to, Lizzo’s new track brings the needed conversation about mental health into the music industry.
The song opens with lyrics about the hate that Lizzo receives, touching on her experiences of loneliness and alienation in the industry. When singing about people critiquing her music, she asks, “is it just because I’m Black and heavy?” And “I’ve been used to people judging me … that’s why I’m so in love with me.” As a role model for those overcoming stereotypes and practicing self-love, Lizzo uses her latest effort to respond to those who pin her down with labels. In a recent interview with Variety, Lizzo was asked about how she feels when people comment on her weight and appearance of looking “tired” when singing on stage. “I ain’t new to stereotypes. But what I’m trying to do is dismantle every stereotype that I have the power to do. I’m destroying them by just living and being incredible all the time,” Lizzo responded.
Personal struggle is a common trope that’s sprinkled throughout most music genres and radio stations — though “Special” is about more than just Lizzo’s experience. The chorus of the song quickly breaks the fourth wall as Lizzo reminds everyone of their beautiful uniqueness, too. Lizzo sings, “I’m used to feeling alone, so I thought that I’d let you know, in case nobody told you today, you’re special, in case nobody made you believe, you’re special.” By switching to the second person and addressing viewers, Lizzo brings herself directly into conversation with her fans.
While some songs may fall flat when trying to empower, there’s something so believable in Lizzo’s delivery of her lyrics. In one of the most emotional moments of the song, Lizzo belts out, “I’m so glad that you’re still with us / broken but damn, you’re still perfect.” While the lyrics may sound cliché on paper, Lizzo sings with a sincerity that allows the audience to accept her words as genuine advice.
To whoever is reading this right now, Lizzo’s “Special” is an ode to letting you know: You’re special.

On a mild summer evening, you’re driving with the windows down and reflecting on life as the sun slowly sets. The song playing on the radio is eaJ’s “Car Crash,” a nostalgic pop-rock track that cleverly employs vehicular metaphors as it takes the listener on a journey through a failed relationship.
eaJ, also known as Jae Park, is an American singer-songwriter best known as former vocalist and guitarist of South Korean rock band Day6. Although he had already begun releasing self-written solo songs and collaborations under the name eaJ in 2020, “Car Crash,” which he shared on April 8, is his official solo debut after leaving Day6 last December.
The song starts with gentle guitar strumming and nostalgic synth. “It was a car crash / Two colors cross the intersect / Red light wasn't the problem / The stop sign drew us deeper in,” eaJ sings in the first verse. Although stop signs and red streetlights clearly signal danger, the two characters in “Car Crash” seem not to notice them. Rather than willingly ignoring red flags or warning signs, eaJ portrays them as being inevitably drawn to each other, with every stop sign adding to their attraction. The production of the verse supports this theme of the ill-fated start of the relationship. By muffling the synth and adding an echo to eaJ’s breathy vocals, the song attains an underwater sound that depicts the lovers as solely focused on each other, blending out everything else.
The chorus departs from this underwater feel by adding more percussion and removing reverb. At this point in the track, eaJ’s vocals shift from dreamy falsetto to a confident belt. Accordingly, eaJ reflects lyrically on the toxic relationship: “Chase me out of your bed just to tell me, ‘Come back’ / And the signals were mixed, so we crashed.” Mixed signals characterize this relationship in which both partners don’t quite know what they want from the other person. eaJ’s melodic line steadily descends until a sudden high note on the lyric “crashed,” playing upon the idea from the first verse that the lovers blend out warning signs. They are so familiar with the ins and outs of the toxic relationship that they only notice too late that it has failed: They have already crashed.
Although the song’s melodic lines are fresh and compelling, its production is slightly repetitive because; the chorus repeats seven times. Given eaJ’s refreshingly experimental previous songs like the theatrical, genre-bridging “Pacman,” one wonders why he decided to go with these repetitions. Indeed, eaJ might simply be playing it safe with his first official solo release. On the other hand, it might be a deliberate choice that is meant to contribute to the nostalgic, dream-like vibe that lulls the listener in.
Notwithstanding the repetitive production, “Car Crash” is a successful start into eaJ’s solo career. Showcasing his talent for writing intriguing melodies and touching, metaphorical lyrics as well as his excellent vocals, fans have much to anticipate for the artist’s future releases.

If one were to blend the expressive vocalizing of Tammy Wynette with the gravelly cadence of Dolly Parton, the resulting sound might resemble something like that of singer-songwriter Sierra Ferrell. As part of her “Long Time Coming Tour,” Ferrell gave a stunning performance on Saturday, April 15 at the Sinclair to a crowd of perhaps the highest concentration of plaid, beards, cowboy hats, and overalls in recent Cambridge history. She was joined by Josie Toney (fiddle), Joshua Rilko (mandolin), and Geoff Saunders (bass) for an evening of genre-bending music and animated performances.
Ferrell and her entourage opened with a lively rendition of one of her most popular songs, 2021’s “In Dreams,” incorporating the fiddle into a song often played more slowly and with only guitar. Though opening with one of her most well-loved songs might have seemed like an initially risky move, the concert only improved from there as Ferrell was able to capture the crowd’s attention and energy with songs from across her repertoire — some not yet released.
After upbeat renditions of “Give It Time” and “The Bells in Every Chapel” from her “Long Time Coming” album, Ferrell slowed it down with “Whispering Waltz.” She was accompanied instrumentally by Toney and, bathed in somber blue stage lights, the two artists created a striking harmony between Ferrell’s vocalizing and Toney’s wailing fiddle that at times seemed to mirror the same rich complexities of the human voice. “We brought it up, so now we gotta bring it down,” Ferrell said.
Ferrell’s Parton-esque voice is as unique as her category-defying music, pulling from honky-tonk country, folk, jazz, and even genres of Latin music like tango. From wistful waltzes to jazz-infused country, Ferrell demonstrated her ability to move gracefully across genres. In slower songs, listeners found beauty in her rich vocals and layered harmonies with other members of the band; in faster songs, the allure was in the speed of the artists' fingerwork, the instrumental solos dispersed throughout, and the passion that radiated off the stage.
While Ferrell embodied a commanding presence vocally, Toney, Rilko, and Saunders gave impressive instrumental solos throughout the evening. Perhaps one of the most compelling moments of the concert occurred when the band played “The Snakes Crawl at Night,” a classic country tune written by Charlie Pride, though notably not on any of Ferrell’s albums. Despite the song’s Southern origins, the band imbued it with elements of jazz and Latin melodies to create a lively melting pot of music. The quartet gave one of their most animated performances of the night, complete with stirring solos from each artist — both instrumental and vocal — and the invocation of hissing snakes throughout. The crowd responded with fervor and mirrored the energy of the band, dancing, singing, and hissing along.
Soon after, the band left Ferrell on stage to perform a few solos accompanied by her guitar. She started with “The Garden” and later “Before I Met You” (another “Pride” song) before the three other members of the band returned. Ferrell's solos provided a breath of fresh air and a chance for listeners to hear the strength, complexity, and richness of her voice unaccompanied by backup vocals or instruments. In these moments, it was clear that while the band as a whole was incredibly talented, its strength was derived from Ferrell's vocals. It seems that this sentiment is shared by others in her fan base; while a studio-recorded version of “In Dreams” with Ferrell and a band has been played a little over two million times on Spotify, a video of Ferrell singing the same song accompanied only by two acoustic guitars has been viewed almost six million times on YouTube.
As the evening came to an end, Ferrell appeared delighted by the energy of the crowd, saying, “Can we just message my manager and my booker and say, ‘Listen … Sierra’s gonna stay in Boston for one more week.’” The crowd wasn’t quite yet willing to part from the singer either. After Ferrell attempted to close the concert with a final rendition of “Jeremiah,” chants of “one more song” rang through The Sinclair.
While heavy rain fell outside on a dreary Cambridge night, inside the confines of 52 Church Street, listeners were graced by a talented band, an eclectic amalgamation of genres, and the voice of a prolific artist.

What do Roblox, Travis Barker, Diet Coke from the fountain, and “Saturday Night Live” all have in common? They are the pressing topics at the heart of the premiere episode of “The Kardashians,” the new Hulu show that centers on America’s unofficial first family. While the Kardashians may have logged 20 seasons of their previous reality show on E!, this new streaming series poses the opportunity for an even more honest and raw look at the California clan. However, it is far more likely that the impetus for switching platforms was a bigger payday for the business-savvy family and not a concern for the show’s creative integrity.
Does the show live up to these promises and provide a wholly new viewing experience? No — but “The Kardashians” remains true to its reliable format in a way that does not feel tired. Instead, the show provides a much-needed dose of slightly ridiculous, completely unrelatable, and genuinely fun escapist television.
The premiere opens with a dizzying drone shot introducing the show’s key players (as if audiences need a refresher) before launching into one of the Kardashian’s classic, over-the-top family parties which celebrates nothing in particular. Kourtney’s relationship with her new boyfriend Travis Barker is on full display at the party, with the couple engaging in heavy public displays of affection. The premiere’s heavy focus on this relationship (which fans know will eventually lead to an engagement) can feel uncomfortably gratuitous, but Kourtney’s giddiness makes it hard not to root for her.
Even casual devotees of the Kardashian universe may be wondering: What does Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend, Scott Disick, think about her new relationship? Luckily, the show quickly provides answers: One scene shows a conversation between Scott and Khloé where he claims to be happy for Kourtney while also complaining about being left out of the family barbeque. While Scott does readily admit to the ways in which he wronged Kourtney during their relationship, his complaints indicate a frustrating lack of self-awareness. But sometimes these feelings of bewilderment are what make the show so compelling.
Khloé’s relationship with NBA player Tristan Thompson is also on full display in this episode, with frank discussions about their romantic separation resulting from Thompson’s prior infidelity. The couple’s conversations about rebuilding trust remind viewers of one of the show’s unsolvable flaws: All the events that we see on screen took place several months prior to the episode’s air date. Because of this delay, viewers are already aware that Thompson admitted to fathering a son with his personal trainer Maralee Nichols while being in a relationship with Khloé. This knowledge imbues the pair’s optimistic discussions of the future with quite a tragic tone.
Fortunately, the show sticks to its strengths at the end of the episode by letting viewers in on some classic low-stakes drama. Kim is fearing that there is possibly an unreleased portion of her old sex tape about to be released (on Roblox of all places) and she recruits the whole family to save the day. Seeing how the Kardashians deal with their somewhat farcical everyday drama is what allows this franchise to endure the test of time, and this moment is nothing short of meme-worthy mastery. Will Kim be able to shut down this anonymous hacker before time runs out? Find out next week on “The Kardashians!”
And lastly: Is Kim really going to get away with dismissively referring to Debra Messing as “the girl from ‘Will and Grace’?”

Mary Laura Philpott is no stranger to introducing her readers to her relationship with adulthood via essays. In her first compilation, “I Miss You When I Blink,” Philpott explores her journey of breaking free from the traditional mundane path of adulthood and reinventing herself into the person she is today.
In “Bomb Shelter: Love, Time, and Other Explosives,” Philpott takes the readers one step further and one step deeper into her world than her previous novel. She hones in on her worries surrounding motherhood, her fears about life and death, and the overall anxieties that spiral within her. And she does so by bouncing back-and-forth between the story of her son’s life-threatening seizure and various mundane events that seem almost painfully insignificant compared to the former. “Bomb Shelter” is a much darker and more profound novel than readers have seen from Philpott before. By letting her humorous personality and honesty drive the narrative, Philpott honors her trauma, anxiety, grief, fears, and, most importantly, her hopes, while inspiring readers to do the same.
Perhaps the most intriguing appeal to the novel is how blunt Philpott is. She combines a childlike quality of not having a “filter” with the serious content of adult life’s trials and tribulations, which makes for a jarring but humorous contrast. Perhaps the quote that best encompasses the spirit of the entire novel is revealed within the first few chapters: “When you are a child who believes your brain can keep planes from crashing, it’s imaginative and precocious. When you’re an adult who thinks your own churning mind is what keeps everything safe, it’s called anxious.” Philpott is brutally honest about these small moments that so many people can relate to but never say out loud.
At times, however, it could be a little jarring to go from an essay on how her son could not recognize himself after his seizure to an essay about how meditation apps don’t actually calm people down as much as they provide an escape from difficult emotions. The humorous latter essay seems almost like a trifling concern compared to the harrowing trauma of the former. And the entire novel follows this contrast between the extreme and the mundane. But Philpott, using this method, adds a kind of raw and real balance to the novel. She shows that life truly is a compilation of small moments that teach us some pretty big lessons. Philpott ultimately conveys that life requires a balance between the “Bomb” and the “Shelter.”
Furthermore, the pace of the novel is rather rapid and keeps the reader on their feet for the entirety of the journey. Each essay is short enough to be read in minutes and, just when the reader thinks they’re deeply invested in the content, Philpott switches gears into an entirely new subject matter and the cycle begins again. Philpott never lets the reader remain content nor comfortable in their reading experience. Each story, each essay, each page is like a ticking time bomb leaving the reader wondering not only when the story will switch to something entirely different but also wondering what happens next in the stories that the reader leaves behind.
The best part about this book is that it truly appeals to all ages. Kids will recognize the childlike nature of the novels and Philpott’s Scrooge-like humor, young adults will appreciate the book’s fast pace reminiscent of social media algorithms, and adults will appreciate Philpott’s honest humanity. She doesn’t pretend to have everything figured out; Philpott is real and raw, and her writing resembles that in every way.
“Bomb Shelter” is not for the faint of heart. It’s for the people who know heartbreak, anxiety, trauma, nostalgia, grief, and loss like the back of their hand. Philpott shows the world that she has been there and she has found hope and strength through her writing. And through laughing and crying with Philpott as the pages turn, so will the reader.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The premise is enticing: Nicolas Cage stars as Nicolas Cage in a film about the revered, meme-worthy star being down on his luck. To raise the stakes a bit higher, “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent” sends Cage to Mallorca, Spain, where he attends the birthday party of a mysterious billionaire in exchange for one million dollars. What follows is an action-comedy romp that prioritizes conventionality at the expense of conducting a more complex exploration of the film’s meta dimensions.
From the film’s opening shot, in which a couple watches a Nick Cage movie and comments on its brilliance, it is abundantly clear that the movie is going to lean heavily on its unique casting choice. While the early mentions of Cage’s name and references to his many iconic films are a fun, “Curb Your Enthusiasm”-esque thrill, the novelty wears off quite fast. Besides the occasional appearance from a terrifyingly bad CGI version of a young Cage who commiserates with his future self about the perils of stardom, the film mostly feels like an international espionage story that just happens to star Cage as himself.
Luckily for viewers, “Massive Talent” has a rather compelling plot, even excluding its meta elements. Cage is recruited by the CIA in Mallorca to find the kidnapped daughter of a Catalonian politician, which sets the stage for various plot twists and flashy stunts that are straightforward but entertaining. In typical Cage style, the actor approaches the role with plenty of intensity and screaming, at some points exaggerating his own public persona in an amusing mockery of himself. While fans should look to his recent performance in “Pig” for evidence of Cage’s nuanced acting mastery, this less impressive and campy turn is a sight to behold.
Pedro Pascal is brilliant as Javi, the elusive billionaire who is obsessed with the “National Treasure” star. His comedic timing combined with his wide-eyed fanboy attitude elevates the film and illuminates his tangible chemistry with Cage. As the two men sob over “Paddington 2” and get involved in farcical hijinks, audiences won’t be able to keep from engaging in the hilarity.
While Pascal shines, the film affords the rest of its starry ensemble far less room to show off their skills. Specifically, comedians Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz — who star as Vivian and Martin, respectively — are criminally underused, and their absence certainly costs the movie lots of potential humor. Their few scenes as bickering CIA agents are some of film’s funniest; viewers are bound to leave the theater wanting more.
While the film’s tropical setting lends itself to envy-inspiring drone shots, the film’s other technical elements are rather unremarkable. The action sequences, especially in the third act, are rather uninspiring and cause the film to drag slightly towards the end. However, Cage and Pascal’s occasional tongue-in-cheek comments on the state of movies today make it clear that the filmmakers are perfectly aware of and comfortable with satirizing this conventionality.
Ultimately, “Massive Talent” is worth the price of admission and a good bid for clever, original films that dare to venture into the realm of self-referentiality. However, for a film which makes Nick Cage playing Nick Cage its main selling point, the execution leaves something to be desired. While a deeper dive into the mind of an aging, universally-beloved movie star struggling with his work may have cost the movie some of its big-budget appeal, it could have produced a more memorable final product. But hey, Nick Cage does as Nick Cage wants.

The film industry is notoriously hard to break into, particularly without a connection to open the door. Yet every few years a newcomer stuns the industry with their fresh ideas and unique perspective. Recent graduate Max Scherr ’21 hopes to be the next.
Scherr was at Harvard as an international student hailing from Moscow, Russia and he concentrated in Visual and Environmental Studies — now called Art, Film, and Visual Studies. He took a media job on campus through the CS50 production department at the advice of an advisor, and gained critical experience there. But as for his concentration, he didn’t get as much hands-on experience as he would’ve hoped.
“I concentrated in VES,” Scherr said. “But that was mostly a theoretical kind of knowledge and background.”
The lack of practical opportunities in the VES program led Scherr to go abroad to a program in London that focused on such work.
“I also worked with the Harvard College Film Festival, which was also a cool experience,” Scherr said.
As a Harvard graduate, he feels a certain kinship to fellow alumnus and director Damien Chazelle ’07. After seeing Chazelle’s hit films “Whiplash” (2014) and “La La Land” (2016) in high school, Scherr was delighted to find that he and Chazelle shared a freshman dorm and concentration.
“I started taking VES classes and talking to professors who educated him,” Scherr said. “My professor was also the professor of one of my favorite filmmakers.”
Chazelle’s work was inspiring — a beacon of light as Scherr plotted the same path. But some of his more defining experiences came while wandering campus as a lonely first year. One of those early days, he first stumbled upon the Somerville Theater.
“When I just came here, I was an international student, so I felt… quite lost,” he said. “So I was spending a lot of time alone, and I just started thinking about what I can do, and I discovered this movie theater.”
Scherr admired the theater and started going there once or twice a week. It was something of a “safety place.” Spending nights at the theater, his love for film only deepened, and ultimately inspired his first professional short film, “Summerville,” about his beloved refuge. After gaining the approval of the theater in September of 2021, Scherr began to write the script.
“People just usually write about themselves and your experiences, but I didn’t just want to make a film about a freshman coming into the theater, it just felt too boring.”
The casting call describes the plot as following “a woman returning to her hometown while getting caught in a blizzard. Seeking a place to hide, she ends up in Somerville Theatre, where much of her childhood was passed. The theatre comes alive and helps her rediscover these memories.”
The five day shoot was an invaluable experience for Scherr, who cites the talent and commitment of the crew for making the scheduling work amidst a February snowstorm.
“It was great to see how much professionalism pays off on these kinds of projects,” said Scherr. “I wasn’t sure until the last minute that it would actually work and we’d be able to pull it off in the time we had.”
Scherr’s main piece of advice to young students who hope to pursue film is simply to make more films.
“What I’m coming to realize now, after school, is it doesn’t really matter where you graduate from. It doesn’t really matter what classes you took,” he said. “It matters what you did, what you made, what you wrote, what you directed, and just having that body of work that you did and that you can attach your name to is extremely important.”
Without your own oeuvre, it’s nearly impossible to get work financed.
“I have a bunch of ideas, to be honest, and what I’m realizing right now is that it doesn’t really matter if you have ideas,” said Scherr. “It matters who you know, it matters if you’ve already proven yourself with something and they’re ready to give you money for the next thing.” The ultimate dream is being able to make what he loves without worrying about finances.
“Summerville” will be entered in film festivals, one of the best ways for young filmmakers to get their name out there. Success at a festival can generate the buzz to finance the next film, or even extend a short to a feature film, as with Damien Chazelle’s “Whiplash” at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013.
Ultimately, Scherr wants to be the next big filmmaker and a serve as a “link between Russia and the West,” in hopes of fostering a more constructive relationship between the two in the future.
As for what’s next, Scherr will keep writing, directing, and working until one day someone takes a chance and invests in his talents. Returning to his roots near Harvard in Somerville for inspiration has helped Scherr along his creative journey. Resilience is key, and Scherr isn’t deterred by the difficult path he faces.

A journey awaits at The Castle.
Following the success of the Immersive Van Gogh and Immersive Frida Kahlo exhibitions, multimedia production company Lighthouse Immersive is displaying Italian artist Massimiliano Siccardi’s next endeavor, “Immersive Klimt: Revolution,” at Saunders Castle in Park Plaza.
Richard D. Ouzounian, the creative consultant of Lighthouse Immersive, said, “We don’t want to make it always look like we’re going for the easy, shot-over-the-left-field-wall. Sometimes you want to do something more difficult, which Klimt is.”
Further, Ouzounian wants the public to know that each Lighthouse Immersive experience is an independent, unique production.
“Don’t think if you’ve seen one of our shows you’ve seen them all,” he said. “They’re very different. I stood up at the opening in Phoenix and said ‘everybody, this is not Van Gogh 2.0.’”
Immersive Klimt concludes Siccardi’s trilogy of immersive exhibitions, which Ouzounian views as a trilogy of revolutionary artists. Ouzounian doesn’t believe these exhibits are a replacement for the traditional avenue of the art museum but rather a new way of appreciating art.
“I think Siccardi’s a great jazz artist,” he said. “I admire Miles Davis tremendously, and people say ‘Sketches of Spain’ is an insult to Rodrigo’s original, and I went ‘no it’s not.’ It’s Rodrigo’s original piece seen through the eyes of a master trumpet player who can get more value — different value — out of it… Siccardi is paying tribute to Klimt’s genius by saying ‘look what else it can show us.’”
With 500,000 cubic feet of projections and 90 million pixels, the exhibition required a large team of Italian production assistants and technicians.
“It’s like watching a Marvel movie, you know,” Ouzounian said. “All these technicians to make it happen.”
“Visually speaking, this one is my favorite,” Ouzounian added.
Another important aspect of the production is the original soundtrack composed by Italian composer Luca Longobardi. Accompanying Siccardi’s visuals, Longobardi’s music provides the audience with a unique audiovisual experience. Notably, Longobardi includes the music of Austrian expressionist Arnold Schoenberg, whose experimental music mirrored Klimt’s involvement in the Viennese Secession movement — a group of Viennese artists who aimed to depart from traditional European art styles.
The finale of the show, departing from the rest of the production, includes mind-bending visuals, rapidly-changing pixels, and what Ouzounian refers to as “unashamed techno pop.” The EDM light show of sorts, accompanied by Longobardi’s original composition titled “MMXXI,” interprets Klimt’s revolutionary expressionism through the lens of contemporary experimentalism.
“Massimiliano and his team were all working on this in the depths of Covid when it hit Italy…there was kind of a sense of death in places, but then rising above the death,” Ouzounian said. “I asked the composer Luca Longobardi, ‘why did you go to technopop at the end?’ and he said ‘because I felt after what we’d been through we needed to dance and party.”
Longobardi’s composition, the Roman numeral for 2021, represents a celebration of Italian resilience and hope during a difficult time. Ouzounian then connected this sentiment with Klimt’s own life.
“Klimt is the guy who went, ‘yes there’s death; yes there’s darkness; but there’s also the tree of life,’” Ouzounian said.
The audience, many of whom sat down or walked around during the 45-minute production, thoroughly enjoyed the exhibit.
MC H. LaPlante ’25, a Harvard student in the audience, said, “The electro pop display brought his artwork to life through an innovative and modern approach.”
Another student in the audience, John S. Cooke ’25, said, “I thought the show was an incredibly intriguing showcase of every aspect of Klimt's life and artwork. The electro pop was definitely an interesting addition, but it represents even more of Klimt's unpredictability.”
Ouzounian hopes Lighthouse Immersive will open more doors for Bostonians young and old to engage with art.
“There’s a lot of people who can’t travel to Amsterdam, so why should they be cheated?” he said. “It’s interesting. Murray Whyte, who’s the art critic for the Boston Globe… was ready to scoff, but he stopped scoffing because his 10-year-old son came along — who never thought much about his job — and suddenly when he saw Immersive Van Gogh, he wanted to learn more about the art.”
The exhibition attempts to distill the essence of Klimt with a contemporary twist, returning to his work with renewed creativity. In the words of the artist himself, “There’s always hope as long as the canvas is empty.”
Immersive Klimt: Revolution opens April 14, 2022 at Saunders Castle, located at 130 Columbus Avenue. Immersive Frida Kahlo continues to run at the Castle.

Despite consisting of only eight Harvard college students, the River Charles Ensemble’s powerful instrumental melody reverberated throughout the entirety of Paine Hall on April 16 as they celebrated their 10-year anniversary with a spring concert.
Founded with the intention of providing a collaborative environment for every type of musician at the college, the River Charles Ensemble is conductor-less and performs a variety of pieces ranging from solos to chamber music involving the whole orchestra. For their concert, they performed three arrangements: “Miniature Viennese March,” “Theme and Variations for Flute and String Quartet, Op.80,” and “Piano Quintet in E Flat Major, Op.44.” Each piece featured a different selection of musicians and contributed a unique purpose to the entire performance.
The Ensemble opened their concert with “Miniature Viennese March” by Fritz Kreisler, highlighting the talents of students Olivia Glunz ’25, Joanna Boyland ’23, and Clara Nguyen ’23, on the violin, cello, and piano, respectively — a trio that captivated observers with their skill. Audience member Stephon A. Fagan-Avery ’23 cited Boyland's technique as one of his favorite moments of the entire show.
“I very much liked the plucking motion and the sound [the cello] made,” Fagan-Avery said.
This piece was followed by “Theme and Variations for Flute and String Quartet, Op.80” by Amy Beach, which featured every member of the ensemble. Navigating a repetitive melody with fluctuations in tempo, the ensemble remained in sync as they moved faster and slower, never missing a beat.
The set included a range of music styles for musicians to explore and observers to enjoy. Audience member Ryan J. Golemme ’23 stated that one of his favorite aspects of the performance was “seeing the changes in styles throughout” the night.
Lastly, the River Charles Ensemble closed with “Piano Quintet in E Flat Major, Op.44” by Robert Schumann, a rather romantic instrumental piece that mixed energy with slower, more emotional moments. This made for a memorable closing to the chamber orchestra’s set.
For some in attendance, the show perfectly captured the spirit of collegiate chamber music. Audience member Tammy J. McLeod said, “In college I was a music major, so it brought me back to the days of performing this high level music.”
Listeners were also impressed by the strength of the performance given the small size of the ensemble. Audience member Ryan J. Golemme ’23 exclaimed, “I didn’t know the River Charles was this small, they still managed to sound really big and have a lot of different moving parts… I thought it was really impressive.”

Any frequent concertgoer is all too familiar with the feeling of P.C.D., or Post-Concert Depression. Now, when the high of screaming along to your favorite song subsides and you’re left with nothing more than a hoarse voice and blurry memories of a set that is increasingly difficult to recall, you can now turn to Concert Archives, the Goodreads concert-lovers never knew they needed.
Similar to the way Goodreads creates an interactive and archivable reading experience, Concert Archives is a hybrid platform that allows users to catalog every concert they have attended on the app or website. In an interview with us, founder Justin Thiele describes it as the “home for concerts to live beyond just the time that you're at a concert.” Part crowd-sourced database and part social media, Concert Archives provides music lovers an innovative and unique way to find community while displaying their love of live music.
With a quick search of an artist's name and city, users can find just about any concert you can imagine. Yes — even that Big Time Rush concert they went to in fifth grade where Cody Simpson opened and all anyone wanted was to be chosen as James’ “Worldwide Girl”.
If users run into a situation where they can’t find a concert already documented on the platform, they can add their own entry which then becomes available to other users who may have attended the same concert. Each concert page is a hub for photos, setlists, and notes about the event, helping attendees remember the details for years to come.
The platform dates all the way back to 2013, when founder Justin Thiele found an old file saved to a CD-R disc containing a list of every band he had seen during his college years. Despite his best efforts to update the list, he remained bothered that he didn’t have a way to cross-reference his list with friends who might remember shows he had forgotten.
“Concerts just mean so much to me, having that shared experience with bands I love and fans,” said Thiele. “People connect so hard to that, that they want to remember and share and interact with other people that were at the shows.”
The platform has a host of features that go beyond providing users with just a list of concerts they’ve attended. On every profile, the user is automatically provided with summary stats prime for music-lovers to geek-out on. From the artist they’ve seen the most, to the venue they’ve frequented most often, creating a profile gives users a rabbit hole of statistics to dive into.
In addition to providing users with their own concert archive, the platform also serves as a form of social media. Users have the ability to follow one another and get updates on their newsfeed when one of their mutuals adds a new concert. On these posts, users can leave likes and comments, building up networks of music fans long after the concert has ended.
Concert Archives both centers a user’s concert history and amasses a database of concerts internationally. While some users fancy themselves “concert historians,” using it as a space to document the careers of their favorite artists, Concert Archives has the potential to fascinate even the casual concert-goer.
With Concert Archives downloaded, perhaps users can fight off the P.C.D. and ride the concert high for a little while longer.

The spring season brings blooming flowers, chirping birds and Coachella, when celebrities, influencers, and anyone with enough time and money gather in a hot, dusty, desert for the sake of music and fashion. Those not in attendance may not be able to come by a live Megan Thee Stallion performance, but they can still judge the celebrity outfits.
Best Swimsuit Outfit: Chlöe Bailey
Many celebrities wore swimsuits with robes, but few looked as stunning doing so as Chlöe Bailey. Head-to-toe in bright colors, she wore a chartreuse bikini with a matching robe and chunky magenta short sandals, all from Beyoncé’s IVY PARK collection. She stood out because she took her swimwear seriously. Many celebrities looked ready for a casual day by the pool, but Bailey approached her swimsuit as a fashion statement and styled the leisurely look in a runway-ready way.
Best Comfy Outfit: Kendall Jenner
On Day Two, Kendall Jenner wore a cropped white tank top, white wide-leg pants with big pockets, and thong sandals. Her outfit was neat, understated, and comfortable. Considering that Coachella attendees stand, walk, and dance for hours in the sweltering heat, the desire to bring back a practical-dress Coachella is fitting, especially after quarantine’s comfy-cute trend. Besides, Jenner could wear a burlap potato sack and people would still call it fashion.
Best Signature-Style Outfit: Billie Eilish
Billie Eilish performed in an outfit that was unsurprising yet perfect for her image. Her matching set of biker shorts and an oversized t-shirt in a muted beige graffiti-print design put her 2019 looks and more recent looks in harmony, demonstrating confidence in her evolving identity and style.
Worst Outfit: James Charles
James Charles’ first-day outfit is difficult to describe and even more difficult to justify: green and brown fabric with orange stitching covered maybe a quarter of his skin. It lacks shape, it lacks style, and the nature-inspired colors are horrendous. This outfit could easily be made of the scrap material leftover from a kids’ art project. Even still, fans were not surprised. For Charles, this outfit is not unusual at all.
Best Outfit: Conan Gray
For his first Coachella, Conan Gray stunned in a hot pink custom Valentino ensemble. His ensemble pieced together long gloves, wide-leg pants, platform boots, and a beautiful, flowy, sheer, veil-esque full-body cape. Monochrome was a popular trend this weekend, and Gray claimed it as his own.
Most Daring Style: Chloe Cherry
Many Coachella 2022 outfits were inspired by Y2K style and fashion nostalgia, and Chloe Cherry managed to channel the eighties, the nineties, and the aughts all at once. She looked like a sassy, unsupervised preschooler, but she owned the looks and her confidence sold her outfits all the same. Her best garment is a denim miniskirt with playful patches and the bedazzled word “KITTY” on the back pockets from day one.
Best Dressed in Street Style: Charli D’Amelio
Charli D’Amelio’s outfits were cute and simple — and there should be space for simplicity in Coachella fashion. She wore mini dresses for all three days: a white crochet dress, a black slip dress with a long mesh skirt, and a yellow-green butterfly dress. Her attire is best categorized as street style, since it could easily fit in an everyday setting. This casual look was not a faux-pas, though; D’Amelio is essentially famous for being a relatable teen, so it was appropriate for her to dress like one.
Worst Dressed, Consistently: Carly Rae Jepsen
Carly Rae Jepsen performed in a pink, multicolored floral jumpsuit with frills and cut-outs, paired with white high-heeled pointy-toed saddle shoes — an outfit suitable for the children’s show “Yo Gabba Gabba!” Debuting her song “Western Wind,” she wore a short one-piece garment covered in silver tinsel-like fringe, likely to represent the track’s title. It was, at best, cheesy and frumpy. Offstage, Jepsen wore a white lace dress that would have been cute for a middle schooler in 2013, perhaps an attempt to return to the days of “Call Me Maybe.”
Ultimate Mixed Bag: Doja Cat
Doja Cat wore the best outfits onstage but the worst offstage. Her first off-duty outfit featured baggy, low-crotch, tragic denim shorts that clashed with pointy-toed, mustard-yellow, tragic tall boots. Her next outfit, with a crop top and black and maroon pants, demonstrated effort but was ultimately unappealing, mainly due to pants that looked cheap and lazy next to the elaborate top. However, Doja Cat redeemed this fashion disaster by performing in four incredible, wholly different ensembles that proved to be the best set of onstage looks at the first weekend of this year’s Coachella.
Best ‘Coachella Style’: Vanessa Hudgens
Coachella continues to be Vanessa Hudgens’ time to shine. First, Hudgens wore a monokini and sparkly crochet cover-up in neutral shades. Next, she sported a magenta outfit consisting of a crochet bikini top, flowy pants, flowy robe, and bucket hat. Hudgens’ most striking outfit was a sheer chartreuse dress over a striped bikini with a straw-woven beach hat. Her looks were fun, light, and vibrant. She took part in many of this year’s Coachella fashion trends — crochet cover-ups, swimsuits, see-through dresses, flowy pants, bucket hats, and monochrome outfits — and made them her own.
During the first weekend of Coachella 2022, celebrities proved that in fashion, one or two central colors, patterns, shapes, or styles will go a long way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a peculiar magic to physical proximity.
Yardfest, which ended its three-year physical hiatus earlier this month, reminded us of the value of being in-person. There, we coalesced into a single mass, our heads empty and free of fabricated stress, cheering dutifully to Swae Lee’s cries of “Harvard University!” The College had not — all at once— experienced this cathartic kind of fun in what felt like eons.
Our in-person traditions are steadily returning to campus, and for that we are grateful. Housing Day, despite not being in its full pre-Covid form, was a considerable success, as dorm-stormers giddily informed the Class of 2025 of their upperclassman housing fates. The University has selected New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and United States Attorney General Merrick Garland ’74 as Commencement speakers, heralding the return of top-tier, in-person addresses for the graduating class. As of writing, Visitas has once again shepherded droves of eager, curious freshmen to the Yard this year, who can finally taste-test the coveted “transformative Harvard experience” without opening Zoom on their laptops.
Our campus has ached badly for these traditions; we have, too. We celebrate their return and the promise they embody — the promise of something better, both new and old, at long last delightfully normal.
The much-anticipated rebound of longtime customs leads us to ponder on broader patterns in our interactions and relationships during the pandemic. Unable to be physically together in one space, we struggled to maintain even the most effortless of friendships through phone calls, text messages, and video calls — mediums that demand constant hyper-awareness of what is said and what to say. Every exchange was mediated, carefully crafted in the pauses and uncertainties in between.
In these interactions, we lost what we had once unknowingly cherished: the simple joy of being in good company without having to meticulously plan our every next move, of existing with loved ones just for the sake of it. We hope the rebirth of Yardfest and other cherished events signals a rebirth of unguided interaction — of friendships built upon haphazard experiences, and not just calculated conversations.
Most crucially, we expect this process to lead us to a true “normal,” not a watered-down semi-normal. Covid-19 burned out a wide gap in Harvard’s institutional memory; only the Class of 2022 experienced a fully in-person freshman year. We fear accordingly that some smaller traditions will fall into this crevice, forgotten as no one thought to ensure their survival.
Harvard administrators should step in to guide us towards this complete renewal, whether or not our collective memory can pin it down. Covid must not be an excuse to trim costs or downgrade our college experience. A revival of summer House storage and full restoration of abandoned gathering places like the Lamont Café both constitute excellent starting points here. The Harvard community depends on our longest-standing members to reorient us in ways we — blinded by brevity — cannot entirely imagine.
In a similar vein, we call upon older students to reopen lost channels between students of different ages at the College. When online, we were robbed of opportunities for the important cultural transference from upperclassmen to first-years.
Hypercompetitiveness, for one, was mitigated among pre-pandemic incoming classes through a mix of tough love and advice from upperclassmen — ‘no one cares about your high school resume,’ they might have said (even if not in so many words), and first-years listened. Moreover, in bringing distinct age groups together, these in-person networks actively combat hierarchy. We eagerly await their return.
Our revitalized traditions open an opportunity for further cross-College connections. Covid-19 shut off casual friendships that existed simply by virtue of occupying the same space — friends we wave to when crossing Mass. Ave or smile from across lecture halls. Large, community-wide rituals and gatherings promise a valuable opportunity to reconnect with peers that we otherwise might rarely see and never get to know.
To the Class of 2026, our first in-person Visitas class in years, we encourage you to take note of these traditions wherever you notice them. Cherish them. Practice them. Soon, they will be yours to pass on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I often bring up with my parents, half-seriously and half-jokingly, that my twin sister and I were never supposed to exist.
Up until the late 20th century, anti-miscegenation laws prohibited interracial marriage in many parts of the United States. The most sweeping changes came with the Supreme Court’s monumental Loving v. Virginia decision in 1967, which found such laws unconstitutional and reversed these practices in 16 states.
I always find it surprising that the Loving v. Virginia decision was made during my parents’ lifetimes — my mother was in preschool, and my father was in college. And even now, more than a half a century later, as I am finishing my second semester of college, interracial marriage remains a curiosity — an anomaly in a still deeply unequal and segregated country.
I am that anomaly. The founders of this country, I am sure, would have never imagined that an Anglo-Saxon man — a descendant of settlers who landed in Massachusetts in 1640 — would marry, much less have children with, a second-generation Taiwanese-American woman. Generations of trauma live within the history of white interracial relationships; often, white supremacy and minority oppression, not love, defined such relationships.
With the social unrest provoked by the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes and the discord sparked by Harvard’s widely-publicized affirmative action case, I have once again begun to question where I, a multiracial American, fit within the larger narrative of racial injustice and inequity in this country. In fact, I have never felt that I fit in anywhere. While my Asian features attract unwanted “nihao’s” on the street, older members of the Taiwanese community have used my white features to dismiss me as a “watered-down” version of Asian-ness. When well-meaning strangers or family members ask if I feel more white or Taiwanese, I struggle for a way to tell them that I am stuck in between. I often feel that I am pulled in two directions, existing in the middle only to be torn apart.
While navigating this in-between space, I have found it most comfortable to settle into my identity as an Asian woman. My Asian mother has made me privy to the American minority experience, and I find it challenging to claim belonging in a white world which I — perhaps unfairly, given my close relationships with my white family — characterize as completely unaware of my mother’s struggles and those of other people of color.
At the same time, the Black Lives Matter movement and even the pandemic have shown me how much my proximity to whiteness has shaped my upbringing. While Black families were subjected to redlining and other racist policies that prevented their flourishing in white America in the 1930s, my WASP grandfather was able to purchase property and amass wealth during his career as a high school educator. While Asian Americans had to grapple with the Model Minority Myth starting in the late 1960s, my father’s whiteness sheltered him from microaggressions and damaging stereotypes. While healthcare inequalities and social determinants such as food deserts have historically caused underprivileged communities to be more susceptible to chronic health conditions, my white family members and I have always had access to good food and healthcare. My white family faced challenges, yes, but race was never part of the equation. And their privilege lives on in me.
But as much as I struggle with the dichotomy between my Asianness and my whiteness, I see myself as a new entity, something beyond blood quantum and fractions of different races. I also see myself as a tentative move toward progress. The racial divide that defines this country lives inside of me at a microscopic level. Within me coexists — sometimes peacefully and sometimes not — centuries of white privilege and two generations of immigrant and minority struggles. I am a living, breathing contradiction of the blatantly racist and segregationist beliefs of some of this country’s most influential leaders, past and present.
I do not pretend that multiracial Americans are the simple solution to centuries of racial oppression and white supremacy. Nor do I think that the United States will ever be part of a post-racial world; even as the multiracial population increases, this country will continue to be haunted by colorism, the ever-present desire for proximity to whiteness and the privileges that it affords.
But I do think that my multiracial identity will help me understand my role in the fight for social justice and define my political beliefs. I hope that I can use my Asian identity to continue to create safe spaces for all people of color, my whiteness to stand up for minority groups, and my mixed identity to breach racial divides, whether they be within my white family or my Asian one.
Being multiracial has only begun to show me my role in the movement toward equality, and I want to make sure that my self-reflection continues well after #StopAsianHate stops trending on social media. I may never feel comfortable in an entirely Asian space or a completely white one, but for now, I am proud to say that I am fully mixed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my favorite feelings in the world, speaking as someone who’s undergone more than 50 surgeries, is the warm, fuzzy-blanket sensation of lying on a frigid operating table as general anesthesia sets in, stinging through my IV, as the world tingles into static and murmuring voices withdraw. I like it because it’s finally a chance to surrender, to let go. There’s no other choice, anyway. Resisting the imminent sleep won’t work. It’s outside my power, so there’s no reason to try. It’s okay to not try. The inevitability of it all is comforting.
I wish life were the same — but it’s not. So I rarely give up — because I can’t.
I’m an advocate. Specifically, I’m a disability advocate, but sectioning off the term that way is misleading, implying that someone can meaningfully advocate for one group without advocating for others. Such a mindset, however, is how the disability justice movement has ended up in its current state of invisibility and erasure, despite disabled people forming the world’s largest minority.
Where has the discussion about disabled people been within police brutality and mass incarceration, when between a third and a half of victims of police violence are disabled, more than half of disabled African Americans are arrested by the time they turn 28, and incarcerated people are twice as likely to be disabled compared to the general American population? Where has the discussion about disabled people been within sexual violence and abuse, when intellectually disabled people experience assault at a rate more than seven times higher than abled people do? Where has the discussion about disabled people been within economic disparity, when disabled people in the US live in poverty at twice the rate of abled people, when disability is both a cause and consequence of poverty?
This isn’t an “either-or” question, a prioritization of one cause over another. It’s the opposite: a matter of supporting everyone we claim to stand for. Yet many of the most dedicated activists consider intersectionality as it relates to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual identity, and religion, among others, while overlooking the disabled people in each category. We live in the shadows, halfway in and halfway out of the world.
I see the scope of this situation, and I want to surrender, to let whatever will happen happen, to fall asleep. And so I return to the question with which I started this column and the theme that has guided my writing throughout this semester: Do I really exist in this world that I’m not supposed to exist in, this world where I’m invisible?
But unlike anesthesia-induced sleep, this outcome isn’t set in stone. So as I end this column, let’s look outward to our community. Let’s talk about some of what Harvard needs to do going forward if it really wants to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society,” to take steps toward building a place where everyone can grow and succeed.
Harvard needs to improve its accessibility, whether physical, academic, or social. Many members of the Harvard community have already explored the problems and solutions, as have I throughout my column, but I’ll add this: Accessibility cannot be a second priority. To be sure, ensuring accessibility, especially when it comes to renovating physical spaces, isn’t simple or instantaneous. But Harvard isn’t exactly lacking for money, and accessibility standards aren’t a new concept — the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law 32 years ago.
We cannot continue to wait, year after year, to be able to attend office hours and visit friends in their own rooms, just because our participation in this community isn’t considered urgent. This need for acknowledgment of our presence extends not only to Harvard’s administration but also to students and student organizations: Please think about accessibility when planning your events. It’s easy to do and means more than you know.
Harvard needs to offer disability studies courses and in the long term establish a disability studies department. No such classes were taught at the College this year, so if you want to study disability, you’re going to have to settle for studying it as a scientific problem or, if you’re lucky, as a medical ethics debate. It’s more than just personally demoralizing. Harvard, after all, is a place for exploration and discovery that’s sending people off into the world completely unaware of the histories, lives, and identities of 15 percent of the global population, unaware even that disability studies is an existing discipline.
I urge every applicable academic department to actively consider what disability studies offerings they can create, or at least what angles they can explore within existing courses under a disability studies lens. The possibilities are productive and numerous, if we only acknowledge them.
For ourselves, for everyone who’ll come after us, disabled people are advocating for change. Because we can’t let go. What I’ve written this semester has only scratched the surface of our experiences.
So, (self)-advocacy: a part-time job for disabled people, on top of our full-time classes, employment, and health needs. It’s a job we have to perform in order to live, a job I’ve embraced over the course of this column. I can’t call myself good at it yet — but by speaking my own individual story, I think my writing has grown louder than my quiet voice.
Contrary to what my unfortunate finals-season habits may suggest, we can’t avoid sleep forever, anesthesia or not. Eventually, we all fall asleep, and we wake up; and one day we’ll fall asleep without waking up. But in that sleep, we visit places unvisited, reach futures unreached.
We dream.
If my writing has made you imagine anything you’ve never imagined before — made you question yourself and your world, made you uneasy, made you uncomfortable — don’t push that away. Think about it, talk about it, bring it with you on your own path; live it, remember it. Those are dreams.
Because living a disabled life means — well, I don’t know, what does living a life mean? But for me, at least, it means that I love this world where I’m not supposed to exist, where I was born a stranger. I love Harvard too, where I’m invisible, where I don’t belong. I love this world because of everything in it, “Percy Jackson” books and vanilla ice cream; and I love Harvard because I can take archaeology classes, because I can zoom down the Science Center’s front ramp, because this is where my friends are.
The uncountable pains and struggles that remain, I won’t give in to. But once I do fall asleep, I’ll dream a new dream for tomorrow, a dream of a world and a Harvard where we can be treated like people. And I’ll wake up and write.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prospective freshmen clad in Harvard merch and red lanyards swarmed campus this weekend for the College’s first in-person Visitas since 2019.
Current students hosted admitted members of the Class of 2026 for the two-day program, which took place Sunday and Monday. Visitas was held virtually for the Class of 2024 and Class of 2025 due to the pandemic.
Harvard hosted an extracurricular fair, department open houses, library tours, and an international student reception. Prefrosh mingled with current students at various club socials and were able to attend Monday’s classes.
Admitted students who attended this year’s Visitas called the weekend memorable and informative.
“It’s been really exciting, I’ve met a lot of interesting people, met a childhood hero — Obama’s economic adviser,” said Max Fan, an admitted student from Melbourne, Australia, referring to Harvard Kennedy School professor Jason Furman ’92.
“I had Cane’s Chicken Fingers for the first time,” said Sazi T. Bongwe, an admitted student from Johannesburg, South Africa, who has already committed to Harvard. “I’d say that’s my most memorable memory.”
Prefrosh said socializing with their soon-to-be classmates was a meaningful part of the weekend.
“Mostly what stuck out to me, though, is everybody’s been really awesome,” Cole M. Salvador said. “Everybody I met has been so much fun to talk to.”
“I met a Brazilian person who's essentially interested in the same things I am — just in a Brazilian context, versus I have a South African context,” Bongwe said.
On Sunday night, prefrosh flocked to the Harvard Square Tasty Burger for a party held in their honor in the restaurant’s basement, a signature campus social space popularly known as “Tasty Basty.”
Students were also eager to get a taste of Harvard’s academic opportunities. Tracy Yuan, an admitted student, plans to concentrate in Applied Math and Biology but is looking forward to trying out other fields of study.
“I'm excited to explore the liberal arts education here as a STEM major because I'm also interested in diversifying my interests,” Yuan said.
Salvador also said he is excited to find his passion at Harvard.
“I'm really undecided,” he said. “So I think I want to take some Gen Eds and figure out my course schedule to really dive deep into what my academic interests are and figure that out for myself.”
On Sunday, organizers from nine campus activist groups staged a protest in Harvard’s Science Center Plaza, before marching through Harvard Yard to the John Harvard Statue. The protesters then relocated to the Student Organizations Center at Hilles to disrupt the Visitas Activities Fair held for prospective students.
Some prefrosh were unable to attend Sunday’s “Visitas Thinks Big!” panel, one of the College’s flagship Visitas events in which notable faculty present their research to admitted students. After Sanders Theatre reached capacity, dozens of prefrosh were redirected to a livestream of the event displayed in the Science Center.
Still, students who attended lauded the event. Fan called the lecture “quite excellent.”
Many Visitas attendees said their experience over the weekend reflected well on the College.
Admitted student Isaac A. Carreno said he is leaning toward committing to the school after Visitas gave him “a new light on Harvard.”
Bongwe said the campus atmosphere stood out to him.
“This place bustles, and there's an energy to it,” he said.
Some prospective students who had not yet committed to attending Harvard said this weekend solidified their decision.
João P.R. Frazão, an admitted student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, wanted to come to Visitas for “confirmation” that he liked Harvard.
“I wanted to commit for the right reasons, and I have the confirmation,” he said.
“I will be committing tomorrow,” said Sukhraj S. Dulay, an admitted student from Brampton, Ontario. “This was the deciding factor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small group of undergraduates rallied to preserve shopping week in Harvard’s Science Center Plaza Monday, urging faculty to vote against a proposal for previous-term course registration at the next faculty meeting on May 3.
While many College students praise the flexibility of shopping week, which provides the opportunity to try out classes before enrolling, some teaching staff and administrators say it complicates course preparation and hiring. In December, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee recommended that the College swap out shopping week for previous-term registration, in which students would register for courses one semester in advance.
During the rally Monday, organizers passed out flyers urging students to encourage their professors to attend the monthly faculty meeting next Tuesday and vote against the plan for previous-term course registration.
William A. McConnell ’21-’22, an organizer of the rally, said the vote at the next faculty meeting is “the last stand” in the movement to preserve shopping week.
“We’ve made a number of efforts and other people have made a number of efforts over the years to prevent the administration from moving forward with this that have not been met with that much success,” said McConnell, a former Crimson editor. “But this is a vote that we think we can win.”
Former Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who helped organize the rally, said student advocacy efforts have managed to keep “the flame of shopping week alive” through the pandemic.
Earlier this semester, the student group working to preserve shopping week submitted a 40-page counterproposal to the Committee on Course Registration’s plan for previous-term registration. The counterproposal called for the preservation of shopping week but with reforms, such as a non-binding “pre-indication” form submitted during the previous term to help teaching staff gauge potential class sizes.
LyLena D. Estabine ’24, one of the student organizers, said in an interview after Monday’s rally that the authors of the counterproposal consulted faculty and graduate students while drafting their report.
“If the faculty vote no, it will provide students with an opportunity — it will provide the whole college, really — with an opportunity to look for true collaboration and create a new system,” she said.
Estabine is one of several candidates running for a position in the newly-formed student government, the Harvard Undergraduate Association, who have made the preservation of shopping week central to their campaigns.
Monday’s rally took place on the second day of Visitas, an annual program bringing newly admitted students to visit campus. Xander D. Patton, a prospective freshman, said shopping week is a “big draw” for him in deciding whether to attend Harvard next year.
Prefrosh Tahraji Milsap said that although course registration will not make or break her enrollment decision, shopping week is one of Harvard’s “little touches of magic” that makes the school “special.”
Physics professor Howard M. Georgi ’68 briefly spoke at the rally, advocating for students to talk to their professors in support of shopping week.
Following the rally, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana said he appreciates hearing students’ “thoughtful concerns.”
“We all want the same thing, which is, ‘How do we create an environment for intellectual transformation?’” he said. “We share the same goals, but we also respect each other’s differences and points of view.”
Estabine said shopping week is an integral part of Harvard’s culture of exploration.
“It's about reminding the College that we are the lifeblood, and that as students who came here seeking out the best education that the country and the world has to offer, that we should and that we can take an active role in determining the details of what that education looks like,” she said.

U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) discussed the future of reparations and the importance of learning from the legacy of Black women in leadership at a Monday talk hosted by Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.
Kennedy School Professor Cornell W. Brooks moderated the conversation entitled “Reparations in 1898, 2022, and Beyond.” Brooks discussed the case for reparations with Jackson Lee and audience members throughout the hour-long talk.
Students in Brooks’ class, “Creating Justice in Real Time: Vision, Strategies, and Campaigns,” made up part of the audience. The class works with public officials and nonprofit organizations to advocate for policy changes set to occur within one calendar year of the class’s end.
Brooks, who previously served as president of the NAACP, opened the conversation by thanking his students for exploring the ways in which justice can be sought for Callie House, whom he described as “a woman who might be called the mother of the reparations movement.”
In the late 1890s, House founded the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty, and Pension Association. The association went on to become the leading grassroots organization pushing for federal legislation and litigation on ex-slave pensions, rallying upwards of 300,000 members, according to one of Brooks’ students, Lindsey Batteast.
Batteast added that House’s success caught the attention of the U.S. government, prompting various federal agencies to devise tactics to undermine the movement. House was eventually accused of mail fraud and sent to trial, where she was convicted by an all-white male jury and sentenced to jail for a year.
“Correct me if I’m wrong here, but she was not a graduate of the Kennedy School — she took in other people's laundry, she was the mother of five children,” Batteast said. “She nonetheless stood up against the force of the United States government.”
During the discussion, Jackson Lee called for the support of H.R. 40, an act introduced in 1989 that would establish a 15-person commission and recommend reparations for African Americans.
“We need the energy of the nation,” Jackson Lee said, referring to her ongoing push for reparations. “This is not done in anger, this is not done with a pointed finger — this is done with a gentle embracing and cleansing and restoring.”
Brooks likened reparations to “preventative medicine,” presenting reparations as not only a way to reconcile the past, but also a concrete tool for future action and change.
“By revisiting the past, we prevent the possibility of replicating the past,” Brooks said.
Throughout the talk, students shared personal stories and referenced examples of reparations in other countries, including the effort made by Germany to compensate Holocaust survivors and the fight of WWII Japanese American incarcerees to secure reparations from the United States.
In an interview after the event, Brooks added that the “strategic challenge” is mobilizing advocates of reparations to push for action.
“We need to make sure that in effect, this social justice course trends, if you will, trends not just in terms of social media but public consciousness,” Brooks said.

President Joe Biden’s approval rating among young Americans fell to 41 percent, according to a new Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll released Monday.
The findings from the IOP’s biannual youth poll of Americans between 18 to 29 years old show Biden’s approval rating is down five percentage points from the fall 2021 edition of the poll and 18 points down from spring 2021.
John Della Volpe, the IOP’s polling director, said in a press briefing Monday morning that Biden’s approval rating is slightly higher among people likely to vote in the 2022 midterm election. Della Volpe said 42 percent of registered voters and 47 percent of anticipated voters in the 2022 midterms approve of Biden’s performance.
Della Volpe noted, however, that Biden has lost more of his own voters compared to his predecessors Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Of Trump’s 2016 voters, 82 percent approved of his performance during the 2018 midterms. Meanwhile, 88 percent of Obama voters in 2008 and 80 percent of Obama voters in 2012 approved of him in 2010 and 2014, respectively.
“Only 69 percent of young Americans who voted for President Biden in 2020 approve of his job performance today,” said Della Volpe, who served as an advisor to Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. “Those people who disapprove today, but who voted for him just a year and a half ago — they rate him much more harshly on the economy.”
Harvard Public Opinion Project Chair Alan F. Zhang ’24 said in an interview that Biden’s lower approval ratings within his own base were “concerning,” but added that the drop in approval comes from “voters that he can win back.”
“These are people who voted for him once already,” Zhang said. “It wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to get them to vote for him again.”
Significant portions of marginalized groups reported feeling “under attack a lot,” according to the poll’s findings. Nearly three-fifths of young Black Americans said they feel “under attack a lot” in the United States as did 45 percent of BGLTQ youth.
A majority of BGLTQ youth said they don’t feel very comfortable revealing their “true selves” at home with their family members, with only 34 percent saying they feel comfortable. At the same time, 60 percent of BGLTQ youth reported being very comfortable “expressing their identity” to friends.
The mental health of young Americans has not improved despite the easing of Covid-19 safety regulations, according to the poll. A majority of respondents described having feelings of depression, and over two-thirds said there is a mental health crisis in the U.S.
Zhang said the poll’s findings are evidence of the mental health crisis, explaining that the findings show “tens of millions of young Americans” are suffering from mental health issues.
Zhang said the causes of young Americans’ mental health issues were particularly “striking.”
“We probed some potential contributing factors to mental health this semester,” he said. “And we found that politics and news media were by far the most destructive to mental health for this generation.”
“Mental health should absolutely be a priority — it is perhaps the crisis of our generation,” Zhang added.

UPDATED: April 26, 2022 at 12:13 p.m.
Noor Tagouri, a journalist and podcast producer, and James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, spoke about their experiences with storytelling and political activism as Arab Americans at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Monday evening.
The IOP’s student president, Janna E. Ramadan ’23, and Anan M. Hafez ’22, who are both Palestinian-American, moderated the event, which celebrated Arab American Heritage Month.
Tagouri said she chose to start a podcast series “because of the Muslim tradition of oral history and the Arab tradition of oral history.”
“We wanted to create an audio experience for people to be able to — while listening — feel like they’re listening to stories that their ancestors are telling them,” Tagouri added.
Zogby said he was inspired to become a political activist after causing an uproar for reporting Palestinian stories.
“My wife and I spent a summer in ’71 living in refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan as I was collecting stories to write my dissertation,” Zogby said.
“I came back and I wrote articles on it and all hell broke loose because I had done what wasn’t supposed to be done — I humanized the Palestinian story,” he added.
Zogby said he founded the Palestine Human Rights Campaign because other human rights organizations refused to advocate for the cases Zogby brought to their attention.
“We have enormous compassion for Ukraine,” Zogby said. “What we did to Iraq was so much worse, and never understood and never felt in the same way because the human lives don’t count there.”
Tagouri said at the onset of her journalism career, she was constantly labeled an activist whenever she spoke at public events because of her identity.
“The only reason I was referred to as an activist was because I wore the hijab,” Tagouri said. “I couldn’t shake it because I knew that it was me being put into a box based on what my perceived identity was.”
In an interview after the event, Ramadan said an incoming freshman student whom she met at an open house event embodied the significance to her of having an Arab American Heritage Month event.
“I can’t imagine what her experience was like to look at the IOP and the forum, and for the first people she ever sees on a stage to be a Muslim woman wearing a hijab — and the prefrosh also wore a hijab — and then a Lebanese Arab man on the TV screen,” Ramadan said.
“I’m in my third year at Harvard, and this is the first time I’ve ever seen people with my identity — that are Muslim or Arab, that speak in this way — to be on a forum stage,” she added. “It felt really emotional because it felt like I was seen.”
The starting point for Tagouri’s current podcast series came from a personal family story. She said that an errant U.S. airstrike killed five members of her family in Libya in 1986.
“The trauma of that incident had carried on throughout generations in our family,” she said.
Tagouri said Western media did not report on the deaths of her family members when she searched the archives.
“When you look into the story of the the airstrike, the acknowledgement of their deaths is nowhere,” she said.
Barbara Rosewicz — a longtime journalist whose husband, Gerald F. Seib, is an IOP resident fellow — told Tagouri during the audience Q&A that she visited the aftermath of the airstrike that killed Tagouri’s family while reporting for The Wall Street Journal.
“I stood in that house the morning after the bombing,” Rosewicz said, leaving Tagouri speechless.
“I would love to know, just from your perspective,” Rosewicz asked, “What happened with the family?”
With Tagouri and other members of the audience in tears, Zogby jumped in.
“I’ll tell you one thing that happened to the family,” he said. “A representative of that family is sitting here on stage telling her story.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University faculty, staff, and leaders enslaved more than 70 Black and Indigenous people over about 150 years, including some who lived on campus, according to a long-awaited University report released Tuesday that detailed and acknowledged the “integral” role slavery played in shaping the school.
The report found that the institution of slavery was essential to Harvard’s growth as an academic institution, serving as a key source of the University’s wealth across three centuries. Harvard had “extensive financial ties” to slavery through key donors who built their wealth off of slavery, the report said — including some who are memorialized across the University today.
The report is Harvard’s most significant public acknowledgement of how it was supported and shaped by the institution of slavery. Its release comes more than two years after University President Lawrence S. Bacow formed the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery. On Tuesday, the University pledged to allocate $100 million to implement the report’s recommendations.
“Slavery—of Indigenous and of African people—was an integral part of life in Massachusetts and at Harvard during the colonial era,” the report said.
The report, which was conducted by a team of Harvard faculty, offered seven recommendations, including a public memorial, partnerships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and a Legacy of Slavery Fund.
The committee studied the history of slavery, racism, and resistance in New England and at Harvard. It detailed how Harvard scholars provided an intellectual justification for racism. In the 19th and 20th centuries, some Harvard leaders and top faculty members “promoted ‘race science’ and eugenics and conducted abusive ‘research,’ including the photographing of enslaved and subjugated human beings,” the report said.
The report found that some Harvard affiliates opposed slavery, fighting against racism on campus. But “on several occasions Harvard leaders, including members of the Harvard Corporation, sought to moderate or suppress antislavery politics on campus and among prominent Harvard affiliates,” it said. The Corporation is the University’s highest governing board.
In an email to Harvard affiliates on Tuesday that was signed by every current member of the Corporation, Bacow accepted the committee’s recommendations.
“Harvard benefited from and in some ways perpetuated practices that were profoundly immoral,” Bacow wrote. “Consequently, I believe we bear a moral responsibility to do what we can to address the persistent corrosive effects of those historical practices on individuals, on Harvard, and on our society.”
The report identified dozens of major Harvard donors and leaders who enslaved people — including many who are today honored with buildings and plaques across campus. The list includes last names familiar to any Harvard student: Winthrop, Mather, Leverett, Dudley, Stoughton, Wigglesworth, Wadsworth, Brattle, Holyoke.
Two of Harvard’s undergraduate houses — Mather and Winthrop — are named after slave owners, while several other are named after relatives of enslavers. Wadsworth House and Wadsworth Gate are named after former University President Benjamin Wadsworth, Class of 1769, who enslaved at least two people. Wadsworth is one of at least five Harvard presidents who enslaved people.
Between Harvard’s founding in 1636 and 1783, when slavery was outlawed in Massachusetts, some people enslaved by Harvard affiliates “worked and lived on campus, where they cared for Harvard presidents and professors and fed generations of Harvard students,” the report said.
Harvard’s entanglements with slavery also extended well into the 19th century. The University and its donors continued to enrich themselves through the slave trade; plantation labor in the Caribbean and the American South; and the Northern textile manufacturing industry, which used cotton grown by enslaved people.
The committee that produced the report was chaired by Radcliffe Institute Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who led a team of 13 professors from across the University. Some members of the group had studied Harvard’s ties to slavery prior to joining the committee, including former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and History professor Sven Beckert.
Minow will lead an implementation committee charged with operationalizing the report’s recommendations.
The report called on the Harvard Corporation “to remedy the persistent educational and social harms that human bondage caused” to direct descendants, Harvard, and the country at large.
“Harvard’s past entanglements with slavery and its legacies cannot be undone, but the present and future are ours—as a University community—to shape,” the committee wrote in the conclusion of its report.
Harvard affiliates have for years called on the school to take steps to account for its ties to slavery. In 2019, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda penned a letter to Bacow demanding reparations from Harvard. Later that year, Tamara K. Lanier filed a lawsuit against Harvard alleging the University profits off of photos of enslaved people she claims are her ancestors. The case is now before the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
Brown-Nagin said in an interview on Monday that the implementation of the committee’s recommendations will be on a “long timeline” since Harvard will need to create new infrastructure to support some of the proposals.
“One of the things that I’m most excited about in the remedies is that they are meant to endure past any Harvard president, any faculty member, any student,” she said. “There’s a commitment to seeking remedies that are in place across generations, just as the system of slavery and its legacies affected multiple generations of individuals.”
Brown-Nagin said certain recommendations, such as identifying direct descendants of individuals who were enslaved at Harvard, are already underway.
The Radcliffe Institute will host a conference on Friday titled “Telling the Truth About All This: Reckoning with Slavery and its Legacies at Harvard and Beyond.” The conference will feature two keynote speakers: Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, and Ibram X. Kendi, the director of the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University. Bacow, Brown-Nagin, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 will also speak at the conference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team fell to New Jersey Institute of Technology on Thursday at University Park, P.A., in the semifinals of the 2022 Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association tournament. The match was the Crimson’s first trip to the playoffs since it won the tournament in 2018.
Harvard (12-13, 10-6 EIVA) entered the match as the No. 2 seed, having swept George Mason (13-14, 7-9) in a double-header the previous weekend. The team’s offensive and defensive performances crystallized in official recognition from the EIVA: both senior captain Jason Shen and sophomore middle blocker Ethan Smith were named EIVA Players of the Week. The Crimson received a bye in the quarterfinals and awaited the winner of the match between George Mason and NJIT. NJIT won that matchup, setting up a dramatic tiebreaker to the 1-1 split it had with Harvard across their two regular season games.
The hosts defended their courts, with Harvard prevailing 3-1 in Cambridge in February but falling to the Highlanders 3-0 during April’s showdown in Newark.
Senior outside hitter Eric Li saw the home-court advantage as a crucial factor to his team’s win against NJIT earlier in the season and something the team could not tap into on the neutral site in University Park.
“The familiarity with our home court and the environment there definitely gave us an advantage and allowed us to keep our momentum going,” Li said. “It was a little different from the match we played on Thursday… It felt more difficult to maintain that momentum throughout, which is something we would have liked to do better.”
Similar to February’s match, the Crimson got out to a fast start on Thursday, taking the opening set 25-17. Kills from senior outside hitter Campbell Schoenfeld and Li, who had 15 and 14 on the night, respectively, allowed the second seed to go on runs early in the set.
“In the first set we came out really hot,” Shen said. “We played really well, put NJIT back on their heels, and I was proud of that. That shows that our team was ready and was in the mindset, but we left the door a little open. In volleyball when you have a team on their heels like that, you just have to finish it. We kept the door open, let them back in, and they were a strong team and we weren’t able to fight back towards the end. We were still competitive and fought hard but couldn’t swing it our way.”
Thursday marked the end of Shen’s tenure as captain for Harvard, and in addition to his leadership he also provided 12 digs to defend his team from Highlander spikes.
Despite continuing its dominance with a strong 4-1 start to the second set, the Crimson soon fell to an eight-point NJIT run. Harvard managed to close the gap and level the score at 20-20 before being outscored 5-1 in the final six points of the set. The Highlanders managed to pull away toward the middle of the third, making its way to a 21-13 lead before closing it out 25-18 and coming within a one-set gap of a championship matchup with Princeton.
Li saw the service game as the reason for NJIT’s success.
“What really turned the tide was NJIT found their groove from the service line,” Li said. “They made it tough on our serve-receive to get good passes to our setter and to be in system. We had a good blocking match, and offensively we were good, too. I think the big difference was the swing at the service line. We were serving better in that first set, but as the match went on they began to serve better and put a lot more pressure on us.”

“The time we beat New Jersey earlier in the season, we absolutely shut down their hitters defensively through blocks and digs,” Shen said. “That’s what we did that first set. New Jersey’s a good team, they went back and adjusted, they started picking up kills, and we couldn’t respond in time. They adjusted really well, and we didn’t as much.”
The Crimson attempted a fourth set comeback to stop the bleeding. Schoenfeld provided kills at crucial moments, starting Harvard runs and stymieing NJIT runs. Smith, sophomore middle blocker Ethan McCrary, and first-year outside hitter Logan Shepherd also contributed to the team’s competitiveness. Although the Crimson managed to stay in the match and within a few points of the Highlanders, it could only save two match points before falling 25-22.
“The last set we pushed through,” Shen recalled. “We were down early and could’ve written that off, but we kept on fighting. No matter what the situation is, the competitive fire is there.”
Although the season is over, there were many bright spots in the team’s performance. The semifinal finish was Harvard's best in the past four years. The team’s youth also proved to be integral to the Crimson’s success; Li noted first-year setter James Bardin, who had 45 assists, four digs, and four blocks on Thursday, as a great addition to the team. Bardin has been a staple of the lineup throughout the whole year. Li also commended the contributions of Shepherd, who was inserted into the starting lineup later in the season.
“I'm proud of what the program has done this year after having basically a full year off and having to come together with a lineup consisting of some new players and some older guys and making it work,” Li said. "It gives me a lot of optimism for the direction of the program and the culture we’ve set.”
Harvard looks to build upon this season’s success next January with a talented class of new recruits as well as returners who now have a year of experience under their belts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby 7s won the 2022 Ivy League Tournament this past weekend, going 3-1 on the day and ultimately defeating Dartmouth for the championship at Mignone Field. It was the Crimson’s fourth-ever Ivy 7s championship and its second tournament win of the season. Senior center Sofie Fella led the way for the Crimson, scoring eight tries throughout the tournament to continue her torrid start to the season.
“Individually, my goal was just to put everything out there on the pitch,” wrote Fella when reached via email. “I also knew going into it that it'd be my last home tournament on Mignone so I really wanted to play for my teammates, coaches and play hard with gratitude.”
The Crimson previously won the 2019 Ivy 7s championship and came into the tournament having won 10 of its last 11 7s matches since 2019, including six in a row at Mignone. Harvard continued its momentum all day on Saturday, despite the pressure of defending its title.
“It’s funny, because it’s such a totally different team than in 2019,” said head coach Mel Denham of handling the lofty expectations “I don’t even think we ever once even had a conversation about the fact that we were defending our 2019 7s Ivy League title. I think that was something that we really focused on was just taking the pressure off and going out there so we could play our game and keep the focus on what we want to do for the day.”
The Crimson started off pool play strong, with a 38-5 win against a Princeton team just recently elevated to varsity level for the 2022-23 season and then a come-from-behind victory over Brown. Against the Tigers, the Crimson got off to a quick start with a try only 20 seconds in by first-year scrum half Reese Morgan, which was quickly followed up by two tries from Fella to put the team up 19-5. Contributions by first-year flyhalf/fullback PK Vincze, senior wing/scrumhalf Sabrina Kim, senior scrum half Cassidy Bargell and first-year fullback Chloe Headland rounded out the dominant performance.
Against Brown, the Crimson found itself in a much closer match. An early score by the Bears was answered by a try from first-year wing/fullback Kiani Akina. A subsequent try by Morgan and conversion by Vincze sent the Crimson into the half up 14-12. After the break, Bargell extended the lead, only for Brown to take a 26-21 lead on the back of a pair of tries and conversions. After tying the game up, Harvard sought a game-winning try on its final drive. With the clock ticking down, junior center/flyhalf Alex Pipkin found Morgan for a game-winning try to eke out a 31-26 victory.
“We sort of strategically planned to kind of match our speed against Princeton and match a little bit more power against Brown,” Denham explained. “But always, at the end of the day, just kind of keep to our game and play our game despite, you know, whoever we’re playing.”
Despite suffering its first defeat of the season in the third match in pool play against Dartmouth, 22-19, the Crimson was immediately able to correct its faults in the teams’ championship rematch.
“It’s hard to win against a team twice in a row in 7s, especially when the team is good competition like Dartmouth,” Fella wrote. “We played hard and well against them, so the narrow loss didn’t really affect us too badly. It fueled us for the next game. In 7s, the team that wants it more is going to win so our focus was just stay hungry and gritty. With this mentality, we had a really firey start and it was a great first half for us.”
The Crimson did indeed come out strong. A quick try by Fella, and one from sophomore flanker Nafanua Malietoa Fitisemanu following a yellow to the Big Green gave the Crimson an early 12-0 lead. While still playing with the woman advantage, Bargell added another try following a breakaway from a ruck, taking the Crimson into the half with a 17-7 lead. Dartmouth was able to cut the advantage to 17-12 with under three minutes to go, but with the Big Green threatening, Harvard was able to strip Dartmouth near the try line and Fella added a final try–untouched–to secure the championship for the Crimson.
Denham expressed her pride, not only for those who were on the match roster, but also the rest of the team’s contributions off the field.
“I think the feeling at the end of this weekend is just really proud of everyone,” she said. “7s is a real team sport. Only 12 people are making these match rosters. So you really have to kind of know your role and be there and be your best for the team. You know, they’re long days and so, really proud of everyone’s effort and also just all of the off field roles with some of our players that weren’t in the playing group this weekend.”
“I’m so proud of our team,” Fella echoed. “ We have been building all 7s season and have so many talented young players. I’m so excited to see them play and dominate in the next few years as well. We’ve been building in confidence as a team and individually as well, which is great for nationals in a few weeks.”
Fella hopes that Harvard’s increased confidence can result in a national title, as it looks toward the USA Rugby Collegiate 7s Championships in Atlanta, Ga. on May 14-15.

Finals week is creeping up on us,and you know what that means: cramming 40 hours’ worth of lectures because you’ve been skipping class all semester. But before all the fun of finals, move-out, and graduation (congrats seniors!), we have a weird transitional week that Harvard calls reading period! Maybe you’ll use these seven days to catch up on sleep or venture to new places to avoid your roommate who is now in the dorm too often. Regardless, here are some tips on how to make the most of this precious time before finals week.
Take a tour of the libraries
Harvard has more than 70 libraries across its undergraduate and graduate schools. While I can’t guarantee that you will have swipe access to all of them, you can certainly try visiting a lot of them and pray to the finals gods that you survive all your exams. It’ll be like River Run but (hopefully) sober and more academic.
Schedule cry sessions
The semester — no, the entire school year — has definitely been challenging in many ways. Returning to campus after so many remote semesters and having to (*gasp*) socialize again can be hard for anyone. Actually going to classes and taking three-hour long math exams? Not the vibe. Whether it’s academics, social life, the crush who started dating someone else, or coming to terms with the fact that turkeys live in trees and can attack you from above at any moment, your feelings are so, so valid. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed at times! Gather your closest friends (human or stuffed animal), and let the emotions flow.
Form study groups
Studying alone on the second floor of Lamont sucks. Getting shushed in the Widener Reading Room is just embarrassing. Take a trip to a talking library instead with some classmates and study together! You can split up what lectures to watch and teach each other or complain about how unfair the grading system is for the class (why can only a certain percent of the class get an A?). Bonus points if you form a study group with your crush. It’s not an actual date, but it will be to you and that’s all that matters.
Ask. For. Help.
You’ll regret your overconfidence soon enough, so just swallow your pride and ask for help if you need it. Professors, section leaders, TFs, ARC tutors, the Writing Center, librarians, and so many others are so willing to help. Take advantage of your resources early on before you have a day-before-the-exam breakdown.
Relax for a second
Go on a picnic by the Charles (if Boston can stop being the windiest city for a second). Reward yourself with some BerryLine. Go to the gym and try to intimidate the athletes by getting on the treadmill right next to them even though the other ones are empty and outdoing both their speed and resistance. Have a karaoke party (but not at like 2 a.m. in your dorm). Go on an excursion outside of campus (leave early because everything closes at 5 p.m. in Boston apparently). Throw a party to celebrate the end of the semester.
Whether you decide to study or to relax or throw a rager during reading period, here’s to finally reaching the end of another school year. Pat yourself on the back for making it through another two semesters without dropping out. You’re doing great, sweetie!
