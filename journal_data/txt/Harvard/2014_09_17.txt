After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“That’s so much more organic!” Mikko Nissinen, the artistic director of Boston Ballet, exclaimed during last Wednesday’s masterclass at the Harvard Dance Center, where he was surrounded by dancers of varied ages and levels sailing across the floor in waves of one combination after another. “That’s dancing—not doing ballet, you know, but dancing.” Nissinen, a Finnish dancer, danced with the Finnish National Ballet, the Dutch National Ballet, the Basel Ballet, and the San Francisco Ballet, where he danced as a principal for 10 years. Prior to his appointment as artistic director of the Boston Ballet in 2001, he directed the Marin Ballet and the Alberta Ballet. Currently, Nissinen is working on a reimagination of Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake,” slated to open on Oct. 30. After the masterclass, The Crimson caught up with Nissinen by phone.
The Harvard Crimson: What was teaching the master class yesterday at Harvard like?
Mikko Nissinen: I have enjoyed my master classes there—I believe it’s been almost, I think, 12 years that I’ve done them. And you know, I really am a big fan of the whole university, and I very much value the relationship we have, and now of course with Jill Johnson at the helm...I’d do anything to help her, and Jill works with Boston Ballet on the Forsythe works, so it’s a natural match.
THC: What do you see the role of dance and, more specifically ballet, in the college campus as being?
MN: For me, it’s even bigger than that. We try as Boston Ballet today, we try to be really relevant to today’s people and today’s people’s lives, and that includes students, people who are already in the workforce, and that’s why the the repertoire that we have is three-pronged: the big classics, neoclassical ballet, and contemporary dances, and everything at the highest level.
THC: What do you see as the role of dance education, not only in colleges, but in people’s lives?
MN: Of course today the arts education has been taken out a lot for many, many schools, so the professional arts organizations do art education, art exposure. But the dance education by itself, even for people who don’t aim to be professional dancers, there’s lots of great things: there’s fitness, there’s insight into the art form, and life skills. It really teaches people how to take projects, stick to them, guide them to successful end results. So there’s lots of life lessons that you really learn by taking dance lessons.
THC: What was the motivation or inspiration behind creating this new “Swan Lake?”
MN: “Swan Lake” is the cornerstone of classical ballet, and I’ve done a version before, but it was like an older brother handing down his clothing…. I inherited sets and costumes that were existing, and so I was limited to do the scenarios around that. Now, there’s a whole new beginning and ending and the visualizations and the taste all across is harmonized. I revised quite a bit of choreography, even when the second act is 100% traditional, Petipa/Ivanov version, which is the single finest piece of choreography for the corps de ballet. The motivation was just to do a really clean, beautiful production that is really my value system and at the same time something Boston Ballet can take around the world in a tour.
THC: You mentioned that the production reflects your value system. What would you say that is?
MN: Well, I can tell you easily that it’s not a sort of Broadway/Disney—it’s much more sort of a classic beauty balance.
THC: In what direction would you say you’ve taken the company since your appointment to artistic director, and where would you like to see the company in five to 10 years?
MN: Upwards and onwards. We’ve gotten a lot done in the first 12 years, and now we’ve had an incredible 50th anniversary—it started with the tour to London and concluded with a tour to Lincoln Center in New York, and had a fabulous home season that included 55,000 people at the Night of Stars in Boston Commons. That sort of turned the page for the first 50 years. Now we’re starting a whole new era, and building from there.
THC: Anything else you’d like to add?
MN: I hope to see more Harvard people at our performances! Did you happen to see the piece “Cacti” last year?
THC: Yeah, I did—I loved it! I’ve never seen anything like it.
MN: Exactly—that’s one of the things I’ve tried to do. Hopefully, we can expose people to something totally new, whether it’s “Cacti” or “Tar and Feathers” from [Jiří] Kylián that can provide a kind of eureka for people that were not aware of works at all in that kind of genre, and it blows their mind and gives them an opportunity to fall in love with stuff like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout my childhood, my friends and I talked about sports every day. This was understandable: I went to an all-boys school in Boston—a combination of two rather fanatical demographics.
There were always certain players that everyone loved—these were by and large one-team players who had never known anything but Boston as professionals. But more importantly, they had to possess a certain fighting quality, a renunciation of flash for a more blue-collar approach. We loved the players who persevered through losing seasons and injuries, who succeeded through hard work and determination rather than pure talent, who stepped up when it mattered most.
But now, most of these players—the idols of our childhood—are gone. Some have retired, but many have been traded; over the years, the various Boston teams have dealt away Nomar Garciaparra, Joe Thornton, Mike Vrabel, Paul Pierce, and Jon Lester, among others. After all, sports is a business, and players are simply commodities for the owners and general managers.
It’s not simply the players who have changed though; I’ve changed too. My friends and I—we view sports very differently now than we did in our youth. As we grew older, we developed a deeper understanding of professional sports, both on and off the field. But the increased knowledge that we gained was not perfect: it has made us more cynical, less innocent and it has shattered the romanticism of sports.
For the average fan, it is easier than ever to understand what happens off the field. Any fan can follow what happens in the front office, to understand the draft, trades, contract negotiations. After all, we do this ourselves everyday: Fantasy sports have allowed fans to mimic the construction of a team—we are each GM’s, building and improving our own rosters. Moreover, the explosion of advanced statistics in sports has even allowed us to evaluate the ability of players just as a professional team’s front office would.
And as a whole, this has improved the way we view sports; fans now have greater insight about what happens in and between games. We can now break the game down scientifically and consider the game at a higher intellectual level by mapping out patterns and tendencies. In truth, increased knowledge has always been the ideal—stats and fantasy teams simply provide a way to realize supporters’ desire to influence the decisions and outcomes of the team.
However, at the same time, this flood of information has its downsides. So much of the modern sports dialogue is not about the game itself, not about what actually happens on the field, not about the human narratives. Rather, we talk about advanced statistics, free agency, and the scientific dissection of a team’s performance. We ignore who a player is in favor of his stats; we are blinded by averages and points; we define and characterize players not by their personalities but rather by a collection of numbers.
And so, the idea of clutch has become a victim of small sample sizes; traits like desire, toughness, and character must be meaningless because they cannot be measured or quantified; even sentimentality and loyalty have no value that translates into wins. Somewhere along the line, we lost the essence of what made sports so wonderful.
Perhaps it is because I grew up just as advanced statistics in sports exploded, or because my earliest sports memories include a number of improbable Patriots and Red Sox seasons, but a part of me longs for the pure, unadulterated sports fandom of my youth.
I wish I still rooted for my teams with that same blissful lack of understanding; I wish I could still believe that my favorite players were simply better, that my teams were somehow inherently special.
I wish I could go back to 2004 and re-live that magical October at Fenway. No statistics, no fantasy teams, just the game itself—the national pastime in that little green painted park.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hard to believe that it happened, but it did. Around midnight on Feb. 5, 1952, a cross was burned in front of Stoughton Hall, where the 11 black members of the Harvard Class of 1955 lived. The incident was perpetrated by two freshmen, whose names the Harvard administration kept secret, and whose punishment was very light: probation, nothing further if no more bad behavior occurred within a relatively short time. No permanent blot on the students’ record. The perpetrators defended their action as a “prank,” oblivious and outrageously insensitive to the history, symbolism, and continuing dangers such violence—usually carried out by members of the Ku Klux Klan—bears.
One of the 11 black students was the late J. Max Bond ’55, who became one the nation’s leading black architects, stressing socially progressive themes and public service. In recognition of his contributions, the City University of New York created the J. Max Bond Center on Design for the Just City in 2011.
Bond passed away on Feb. 18, 2009. I joined more than 800 of Max’s family, friends, co-workers, and admirers for a commemoration of his life three months later at the Cooper Union Great Hall.
Max’s widow, Jean Carey Bond, a writer, teacher, and activist, had prepared an 11-page recollection of his life. In it, she noted that Max entered Harvard at age 15, finished in three years, graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa. Yet shortly after his fifteenth birthday, he was welcomed by the burning cross. Even more outrageously, wrote Ms. Bond in the handout, he was subsequently threatened by the Harvard administration (presumably to protect the University’s image) that any black student who reported the incident to the Boston media would be suspended.
But Max and Lou Sharpe, co-chair of the Harvard Society for Minority Rights, defied the threat, and a story or short account of the cross-burning appeared in The Crimson, the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, the New York Times, and elsewhere, in the U.S. and abroad.  As someone (white) whose work and personal life are replete with anti-racism activities, I decided I’d try to get Harvard at least to apologize for their alleged threat (and the censorship that threat would have constituted). While this is a very different era in U.S. race relations and one hopes that such an event would not happen today, past incidents of racist behavior certainly deserve an apology, if only for its educational or symbolic value.
I first wrote a letter to the editor of Harvard Magazine. Next I went to the top: On Sept. 2, 2009, I wrote University President Drew Gilpin Faust, recently appointed as Harvard’s first female president, referring to my just-published letter, summarizing the history, and urging an institutional apology. Indeed, Brown University had just recently apologized for its own racial history. In return, Faust wrote me, essentially asking for documentation of the threat and clearly reluctant to accede to my request.
While I made some real effort to locate such documentation, attempting to contact the relevant deans at the time, such historical documents are essentially closed to researchers; contacting those of Max’s fellow black students whom I could find (some of whom—more than five decades later—had only dim memories of the incident), but who were unable to pass on to me any firm proof of who made the threat, to whom, and in what form.
President Faust’s response struck me as truly off-putting and defensive—no offer to search the archives (by me or someone else) for relevant documentation, no willingness to contact Jean Carey Bond or their children to find out what Max had told them of that incident, no trust that Jean was accurately reporting something Max had conveyed to her. President Faust’s words: “Unfortunately, in a university as old as ours there will be many regrettable incidents involving administrators whose values are different from ours, and not all of them are easily verifiable after much time has passed… [The] episodes described in your letter to the magazine are particularly egregious and make painful reading. I do appreciate your bringing them to my attention.”
Her response was particularly off-putting because the issue was not just a simple matter of different values and the behavior of some administrators. The institution provided a setting for that incident, reflecting racism and denial of rights that should have been strongly condemned at the time as well as now. The apology due should go beyond what happened in February of 1952 and encompass a genuine understanding of Harvard’s history with respect to race.
And so that’s where things stand, save for my writing up and disseminating this more than half-century-old history. I do this partly because I believe it is of general interest to lots of folks, and partly to hopefully generate public pressure on President Faust to do the right thing—to accept the fact that this happened, or even, if that’s her preference, to simply apologize for its mere possibility.
Quite likely, such a public apology by her would be widely reported.
The matter is in her hands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Inter-House restrictions at dining halls have long been a part of life at Harvard College, but this year students will be introduced to a new set of restrictions. In an email sent to College students Wednesday, Stephen Lassonde, the Dean of Student Life at the College, wrote he was “pleased” to announce the beginning of “Community Nights” on Thursday, during which students will only be allowed to dine in their own Houses until seven.
Many students are somewhat less pleased than Lassonde, with several expressing concern—most notably the executives of the Undergraduate Council. As UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 points out, the restrictions effectively prohibit clubs from meeting on Thursday nights. They also disproportionately affect students living in Mather and the Quad, who may have to attend activities on the river during dinnertime.
Proponents of the restrictions, notably Lassonde, have stressed Community Nights as a way of grounding students in their Houses and facilitating a “sense of belonging.” We do not disagree that community spirit should be encouraged in each of the Houses. In this case, it not a problem of goals but of means.
Ideally, each House should feel like a semi-autonomous community within Harvard. They should truly be houses—places where students feel at home, forming close bonds with House masters, staff, and each other. Rather than bureaucratic dicta, we would like to see House Masters and Tutors take an active role in encouraging intra-House bonding without infringing on students’ options.
Such extensive inter-House restrictions simply do not seem like an effective means of encouraging community within Houses. Even if they are forced to eat in their house, students will still likely opt to sit with people they already know. If the Office of Student Life truly wants to foster community bonding, it should encourage events and activities that promote the creation of new friendships inside a House.
Many houses already have such systems in place. Adams House has designated “Gold Coast” Community Tables, where members of the House can sit during meals in order to meet other House residents. Cabot has weekly Cabot Conversations, where members of the House community gather to discuss their lives.
Although the Quad Houses and Mather House will extend their dining hall hours, this may not alleviate the problems for those students who live in less central locations. Given the number of club activities that take place around the Yard in the evening, it is unlikely that all students will find a time to rush back to their Houses for dinner. Although the restrictions end by seven, students whose meetings start at that may be left without adequate nutrition.
College administrators should lead with the proverbial carrot rather than the stick. Instead than implementing new policies that keep students out of other Houses, we should find ways of drawing them into their own, making community dinners a cherished event instead of a pain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember freshman move-in well: meeting roommates, delaying goodbyes to family, and rifling through boxes trying to remember where I packed my neck-ties. Amid all the activity, I noticed my father frowning down at the latest edition of The Crimson. When I asked what was troubling him, he silently handed me the paper and pointed at the offending text: “Republican: Rare political species targeted for extinction by the dominant, ‘open-minded’ liberal populace which rules the Yard roost. Watch them as they graze.” He shrugged apologetically and said, “Good luck. It’ll be a long four years.”
Harvard’s student body is a potpourri of races, sexualities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, but the diversity on campus comes to a screeching halt when one considers political philosophy. The Crimson’s freshman survey for the Class of 2018 found, “A plurality of respondents identified...as ‘somewhat liberal,’ whereas only a combined 15 percent of respondents identified as somewhat or very conservative.” I cannot feign astonishment. Throughout freshman fall, I became accustomed to the dawning looks of suspicion on my new friends’ faces as we discussed the ongoing campaign. Inevitably, I’d be confronted with the horrified question, “You’re not a Republican, are you?” I must give them credit, for they were compassionate when I answered in the affirmative; they patted my hand gently and promised that we’d get through this together, as if the revelation of my ideology was akin to diagnosis with some fatal cancer.
Assuming that I am a reasonably intelligent person (I did, after all, gain admission to this school), why then am I a conservative?
There is good, and evil, and both exist in the world. Human beings contain differing quantities of both. One need not examine the historical record long before finding proof of my assertion. Despite this, for centuries there has been an enduring strain of thought that preaches that if everyone were just a little more like “us” - insert your favored “us” here - then everything would be fine. But somehow, no matter which “us” holds the reins, conditions never reach the ideal. Why in 2014 do we insist on moral absolutes and strict ideology?
Conservatism is for me the ultimate pragmatic realism, acceptance of the world as it is and not how we wish it would be: We ought to conserve that which is good in the world, and combat that which is bad. People are not perfectable, and neither can the nations they create be perfect. Too many American conservatives believe that utopia was achieved with the ratification of the Constitution, and too many liberals believe that it will be achieved if they can just guarantee birth control for everyone. In truth, no such thing will come to pass–the new Jerusalem lies outside of Washington’s grasp.
Conservatives are often parodied as opponents of “progress” simply as a matter of principle. On the contrary, we recognize that “progress” can be either good or bad, depending on the direction in which one is advancing. Conservatives should not be mindless parrots simply shouting the word “No,” but rather the killjoys thºat listen to liberals explain their latest pipe dream and then ask, “Spectacular, but how shall we pay for it?”
My conservative vision bears little resemblance to the contemporary American variety. Where is my refusal to accept empirical data on global warming, the insistence on abstinence-only sexual education, the sanctimonious preaching on homosexuality? Well, to be frank, nowhere. I enjoy framing my ideology with the colloquialism, “If it ain’t broke, it ought not be fixed.” Believing this is not the same as believing that nothing in the world is broken; that would be the height of folly. One need only look at the riots in Ferguson, or teen pregnancy rates, or the death toll in Syria to confirm that all is not well in our world. Refusing to find solutions simply because you are personally comfortable is indicative of a deep irresponsibility and apathy. Trust me, I long for the days when liberals were the ones who rejected the heavy burden of reality. But mine is a different social context. To maintain fidelity to my political beliefs I must dispense with rose-colored glasses and see what is front of me.

It’s a quiet Friday afternoon, and Thomas the Tank Engine is playing on what I can only assume is at least a 52-inch television screen. Someone’s child—or, more likely, Cambridge’s youngest innovator—watches lazily while licking chocolate off his upper lip and fiddling with a half dozen keurig pods.
Welcome to the i-lab.
Located just behind the Business School, at 125 Western Ave, the i-lab—or Harvard Innovation Lab—was started in 2011 as a resource for entrepreneurs and innovators in the greater Boston area.
In general appearance, the i-lab is what you might imagine Google’s headquarters or Elon Musk’s home offices to look like. It’s a lot of open space, white walls, egg-shaped chairs, and smart people drinking coffee. I am relieved to see the “Hi” sign at the entrance. I’ve walked 20 minutes to get here, because I’m still not innovative enough to figure out the shuttle schedule.
Usually, the space isn’t so quiet.
In a couple of weeks the i-lab will be bustling with people. Over 80 teams of venture capitalists will swarm the site to participate in the i-lab’s Venture Incubation Program. These projects are diverse and incredibly imaginative: sprayable cakes, a gluten-free snack made of crickets, some sort of complicated medical technology, and an app that helps you get day labor to assemble things like Ikea furniture.
The i-lab boasts 30,000 feet of space, 250 work stations, over 24 conference rooms, and a kitchen. I’m especially interested in the kitchen. I have come for the free food,  and to play Rock Band on the i-lab’s Xbox. I feel entitled to this, because I assume that this is what my tuition is paying for.
As it turns out, my tuition doesn’t flow directly into the i-lab. Rather, the i-lab is funded by a combination of anonymous benefactors and universities. Or so I am told, when I ask one coordinator where the big money is coming from.
There are a few open tables in the front of the room, and because it’s in the i-lab, they have a fancy name: the Day Use space. The tables are for people like me. Harvard students (undergraduates or graduates) who aren’t involved in an “incubation team” and just come to eat the free Easy Mac and make cherry-lemonade-diet-vanilla-coke with the soda machine.
With the high-tech aspartame machine and abundance of ramen, the words More Healthy Snacks on the suggestion dry erase wall should come as no surprise. But the i-labbers have other suggestions too, including the addition of bouncy ball chairs and a treadmill desk. I should point out that there is another wall featuring third world problems—a giant infographic about the worldwide prevalence of AIDS and STIs.
I should also point out that the i-lab already has a treadmill desk. It is in room 156, but it is reserved for the afternoon. Perhaps someone should ask for another one, because our young innovator, having lost interest in the television and the chocolate on his upper lip, has taken to running around the floor.
During his second lap, we make eye contact. I try to smile at him in a way that won’t make his parents excessively nervous as I toss a handful of Starbursts in my pocket for later. We are sharing not just a moment, but also flashy toys and an endless supply of Jolly Ranchers—I too have come to the i-lab to play.

Harvard University Police Department arrested a homeless man who reportedly assaulted a group of individuals outside Johnston Gate on the west end of Harvard Yard early in the morning on Sept. 9.
Keith Johns, a 28-year-old homeless man, reportedly threw a cell phone at a group of people walking in Harvard Square at 1:18 a.m. and struck one of them, according to a Harvard University Police Department log from the day of the incident.
Johns then approached the group in what was reported as “an aggressive and threatening manner,” and taunted them. According to the report, he also asked,  “What are you going to do?” and said, “I'm going to get you.” The offender then left Harvard Yard.
When HUPD arrived on the scene, they searched the area and found Johns. They then questioned and arrested him on the spot for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, according to the police report.

The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter Youth Initiative, the first overnight shelter to cater to the youth population of Cambridge, has received a rare government grant that will help fund its operating costs for the next 15 years.
According to the Initiative’s co-directors, Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 and Sam G. Greenberg ’14, the Cambridge Housing Authority has agreed to provide the initiative with an operating contract of $50,000 a year once the shelter opens next fall.
“[The CHA sees] this as an opportunity to house a particularly hard-to-house population, which is young people,” Greenberg said.
The move is unusual for the CHA. Housing authorities typically refrain from funding projects, such as homeless shelters, that fall outside the realm of affordable, permanent housing.
The CHA, however, was given extra leeway from the Department of Housing and Urban Development because its programs are more successful than those of most authorities, according to Greenberg. He noted that CHA has benefited from easy access to Harvard and MIT professors with expertise in urban development.
Greenberg and Rosenkrantz plan to tailor their shelter specifically for homeless youth by introducing features that differ from traditional shelter practices. For example, the shelter will include gender-neutral sleeping quarters and bathrooms since up to 40 percent of the youth homeless population nationally identifies as BGLTQ.
“There really isn’t a model for it,” Rosenkrantz said, adding that they hope to develop an arrangement that would be feasible for other shelters across the country to emulate.
They plan to partner with Youth on Fire, a daytime drop-in center in the Square that provides services such as hot meals and counseling.
Youth on Fire, which was considering a move to Central Square last spring due to a lack of funding, was able to remain in its current location near the Law School campus after receiving additional assistance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s Office of HIV/AIDS, according to Carl Sciortino, executive director of AIDS Action Committee. The committee is the parent organization for Youth on Fire.
“That funding provides a partial investment in the overall deficit the program currently faces, but gives us enough stability to remain in place while pursuing other funding,” Sciortino said.
Greenberg and Rosencrantz said the shelter will either share space with Youth on Fire in Harvard-Epworth Methodist Church or set up at a church down the street, the First Parish in Cambridge.
As they move forward, Greenberg and Rosenkrantz said they are receiving advice from not only Youth on Fire but also faculty on the shelter's board, whose members include Dean of Public Service Gene A. Corbin and Cabot House master Stephanie Khurana.
“There is an incredible energy for this project because there’s such a need,” Greenberg said.

Nicholas D. Kristof ’81, a columnist for the New York Times and a Harvard overseer, took his notebook to the stage of Sanders Theatre on Tuesday afternoon for a wide-ranging interview with University President Drew G. Faust.
In front of a three-quarters full theatre, Kristof was not shy with his questions, asking Faust to defend Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign in light of the school’s massive endowment—at last report, it was worth nearly $33 billion—as well as legacy admissions and the University’s handling of sexual assault.
Early in the program, Kristof steered the conversation to the capital campaign, which has jumped off to a lightning start and aims to raise $6.5 billion by 2018. He reiterated a question raised by others about why Harvard needs more money.
In response, Faust stressed that Harvard is uniquely positioned to effect change, through its students and its research, around the world.
“When we see what we’re not able to do, and what would be possible, that’s how we justify that [endowment],” Faust said in a long answer that highlighted Gerald L. Chan’s recent $350 million gift to the School of the Public Health as well as the school’s ability to help respond to current health crises, like Ebola.
Throughout the conversation, Kristof pivoted frequently, jumping from topics like legacy admissions—Faust said that about 12 percent of Harvard undergraduates are legacies, and that while legacy students are admitted at a higher rate, they also have higher test scores and grades than the average applicant—to divestment, where she reiterated her long-held stance that dumping Harvard’s fossil fuel investments would politicize the University’s endowment in a way she does not support.
“I think divestment is not the direction towards making a difference on the climate issue. I think that our research, our teaching are fundamental to that effort, and that’s the best contribution universities can make,” she added.
The duo devoted significant attention to campus sexual assault, an issue that has captured national attention amid complaints that schools, including Harvard, are not doing enough to prevent assaults and take care of victims.
“One issue that has been in the news a lot around the country and here at Harvard has been sexual violence,” Kristof said. “Do you feel that the efforts that the University has been making as a whole are affecting the way things are actually unfolding on Saturday nights on campus?”
Faust responded in much the same way she has in recent months, declaring her intent to focus on prevention strategies as well as better investigatory and disciplinary procedures.
“Sexual violence has no place on this campus,” she said. “One of the most important approaches is to make sure it doesn’t happen in the first place, and that [goal] of prevention is one in which we are investing a lot of attention.”
Faust emphasized the importance of collecting more authoritative and comprehensive data on sexual assault, in an effort to answer the questions: “Is the type of program we’ve put in place the best possible one? What can we learn from other institutions?”
Asked by Kristof to assess the effectiveness of the University’s recently enacted policies around sexual harassment, Faust was optimistic. The new policies include a central office of sexual harassment investigators, adoption of the “preponderance of the evidence” standard, and beefed-up staff at the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention.
“I would say yes, we’ve had an impact,” she said. “People are so much more aware of this and that is a good thing, but we have lots more to do in making sure that the different programs that we’ve introduced are having the most powerful effect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 17, 2014, at 12:30 a.m.
Despite voicing concerns about the prospects of blending online courseware and in-person teaching, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol expressed cautious optimism for new technology’s potential in higher education during a panel discussion at the annual Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching conference on Tuesday.
“We face...a perfect storm of problems and a perfect storm of opportunities," Bol said of the present moment.
He noted that while the introduction of blended learning courses at Harvard came with declines in rigorous note-taking in class, attendance, and time spent working outside of class, the pedagogical experiments generated widespread interest among faculty, paving the way for further experimentation.
Bol’s comments echoed an analysis of four courses that integrated HarvardX online material with face-to-face teaching in the classroom, employing what educational professionals call a “flipped-classroom” approach. The analysis and subsequent report found that student satisfaction with the pilot courses was mixed, though the report included recommendations for improving the next batch of blended learning courses.
Bol’s focus on undergraduate education at Harvard was complemented by fellow panelists, who presented varied perspectives on the education of teachers, pedagogy at small liberal arts colleges, and adult education.
The panel, titled “Institutional Adaptation Pt. II,” was moderated by former Harvard Corporation member Robert D. Reischauer ’63 and featured Bates College President A. Clayton Spencer, Dean of the Division of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert, Graduate School of Education Dean James E. Ryan, and Bol. The all-day conference took place at the Law School.
Throughout the afternoon session, members of the panel answered questions on the value of technological innovation and experimentation in their field, as well as the challenges of implementing technology in the classroom.
Ryan raised concern over a lack of training in technological literacy and virtual education for teachers, particularly for K-12 teachers, at his school and others.
“We have not done enough in terms of pre-service or professional development to enable teachers to take advantage of the learning technologies that exist,” he said.
Responding to a question from Reischauer, Lambert argued that in developing online education tools, Harvard should give high priority to community service and improving accessibility to Harvard’s intellectual resources.
“One hundred and four years ago, President [Abbott Lawrence] Lowell founded the Extension School,” Lambert said. “A course cost two bushels of wheat, but the key insight was Harvard should be making its faculty and its knowledge available to the local community of Cambridge and Boston.”
Bol, who spoke after Lambert, stressed the “tensions” the University faces in developing online courseware given limited resources and the intensive demands of production.
“Free doesn’t sustain, right?” Bol asked. “A little bit from a lot of people makes education more affordable for everybody.”
The annual conference, named for its theme, “Engagement and Distance,” also included remarks from University President Drew G. Faust and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, a panel on adapting technology and research to the classroom environment, a series of breakout sessions, and presentations on educational research findings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Israeli national security advisor and retired Major General Yaakov Amidror and former American national security advisor Thomas E. Donilon weighed in on strategies for negotiating with Iran and approaching the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday night.
During the conversation, which was moderated by Belfer Center Director and Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison, Amidror said that ISIS is a part of a larger problem stemming from Islamic extremism in the Middle East.
“From the Israeli perspective, ISIS is one of many Islamist groups who, despite their differences, all believe that Islam should control the Middle East,” Amidror said.
When Allison, suggesting that Iranian-sponsored groups have been effective in countering ISIS, asked them whether enlisting Iran’s help on the issue would aid American efforts to defeat the group, both panelists rejected the idea.
“There is a way to defeat ISIS with tribes in Iraq and without putting Iran at the center,” Amidror said. “You can recruit the tribes or Iran, but not both.”
Donilon then said that the “authoritarian and sectarian” Iranian-supported government of former Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki raises questions about whether Iran’s involvement in the battle against ISIS would prove beneficial, due to differences in governing styles.
“You have to think about what type of government Iran is interested in having in Iraq. We need a unity government,” he said.
During the second half of the panel, some differences emerged in the speakers' views as Allison asked questions about U.S. negotiations with Iran, focusing on the Geneva interim agreement reached last November.
Amidror said that he felt that Western powers had become too lenient with Iran.
“The Iranians have found ways to improve their economy because of the easing of the economic sanctions,” he said. “If the pressure will not be raised on Iran, then the chances of reaching an agreement with them will decrease.”
Donilon, who was involved in the Obama administration’s efforts to negotiate with Iran, countered that the negotiations did in fact sway the discourse in favor of the U.S. and caused the Iranians to compromise on their nuclear policy.
“The interim agreement is a solid basis for negotiations and froze the existing system,” he said. “Leverage on the long haul is on the side of the international community. We will not accept a bad deal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following nearly three years of discussions and efforts to centralize Harvard’s existing student systems for bill payment, course enrollment, and registration, a new platform for students to pay bills and receive paychecks will launch in November.
Only select University administrators will be able to access the system this fall, and students are expected to gain access to the tool next summer. The full system—which will feature a number of applications, ranging from a revamped course catalog to electronic study cards—is slated to launch for faculty and students in Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the fall of 2015.
The creation of this student system is one of the first steps of a larger effort to centralize existing web systems and bring together students from across Harvard’s schools to make it easier to pay bills, submit study cards, and register online.
Once completed, the centralized student information system system will decrease the total number of student portals from 12 to three. The Business School and the Law School will continue to use their current platforms as well as the new, centralized student information system.
“I think that the current systems that we have are very labor-intensive,” said Managing Director for Harvard Student Information Systems Jason Shaffner ’99, noting that students have to visit different websites to look for courses, register online, and pay their bills.
As an example, the University currently runs a central billing system that is disconnected from the individual student systems, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. In the new student information system, the billing system will be integrated into the same network as other course- and registration-related features and better integrate student employment and payroll.
The project has called on hundreds of University administrators to work on technical platforms, migrate 35 years of data, and seek feedback from students. The team—which includes representatives from Harvard University Information Technology and the Office of the Registrar—has been recruiting designers and constructing the system since May 2013, and they face a hard deadline to roll out the whole system.
“Time is the biggest challenge,” Burke said of the fall 2015 deadline for the FAS portion of the system. “We have a pretty aggressive timeline, though it may seem as though we’ve been working on this for a long time.”
In addition to the back-end launch of the billing system in November, the University plans to launch a back-end version of the course catalog in the winter so that faculty and administrators can begin adding information about their courses.
Burke added that though designing and implementing the student information system is expensive, Harvard’s project will be less expensive than similar projects at other comparable institutions.
“Compared to other universities of our size, we seem to do this for less money,” Burke said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An overtime header by junior midfielder Tim Schmoll gave the Harvard men’s soccer team (1-3-0) its first win of the season, 3-2, over Boston College (3-2-1) Tuesday night.
The Crimson more than doubled its previous season scoring output with the trio of goals, with captain Kyle Henderson and freshman Daniel Smith notching scores in Harvard’s first three-goal performance since November 2011.
“They are a good team,” Schmoll said. “We had some good chances, and I think we played out our game plan pretty well…. We are going to look at it tomorrow and then move on to the next game.”
ACHIEVING ITS GOALS
Leading up to the game, players and coaches argued that “all the parts were there” on offense, noting that the team had generated 21 shots on goal in its first three games. On Tuesday, the Crimson launched 12 shots on goal—nearly twice its season average—and converted three for a 25 percent conversion percentage.
The scoring started in the 21st minute, when sophomore forward Daniel Smith corralled a rebound and slipped the ball past Eagles goalkeeper Alex Kapp to tie the game at one apiece. It was the only shot that Smith took all night.
The Crimson kept up the pressure until the end of the half, generating another chance five minutes later, when Schmoll was unable to convert a chance on goal. In the 44th minute, Harvard took the lead when Henderson—on the third straight Crimson shot attempt—knocked the ball in to give Harvard its second lead of the young season.
“We work at it every day, not just the finishing part but the mentality about how we get to the final part of the game,” coach Pieter Lehrer said. “They are confident in getting possession and getting forward. It’s a good win against a good team.”
BACK FOR SCHMOLL
The Crimson, however, failed to generate an insurance goal during the opening moments of the second half, and Boston College came through with a late equalizer when Isaac Normesinu drove in an 88th minute goal.
At that point, the game bore many similarities to last year’s Ivy League opener at Yale.
That day, the Crimson carried a one-goal lead into the 87th minute of play, only to see the Bulldogs score a pair of goals before the whistle blew, taking home a 2-1 win over its archrival.
Against Boston College, there was to be no repeat; in fact, the Eagles would not even take another shot. Playing down a man after Derrick Boateng got a red card in the 84th minute, the Eagles played on their heels after surrendering the goal.
The Crimson controlled the ball for the last minutes of regulation, with Henderson missing wide in the 90th minute. Then, just five minutes into overtime, Schmoll had a shot blocked before knocking in a header off the ensuing corner kick.
“I think we got a bit lucky with the red card—I don’t know if that was fair but we will take it,” Henderson said. “We had numbers up at the end of the game and we capitalized.”
CRUCIAL STOPS
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson limited the Eagles to just seven shots on goal and 13 overall. Boston College came into the game averaging just over 15 shots a game, but Harvard held sophomores Normesinu and Zeiko Lewis—focal points of the Eagles’ attack—to just two shots on goal between the pair.
“[The defense] is great, they have done a great job all year,” Lehrer said. “The first goal [junior co-captain] Mark [Ashby] made an uncharacteristic mistake but Mark, for such a big guy, moves very well and is really an elite defender. That kind of mistake you will probably never see for the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing 6’6” tall, Harvard midfielder Tim Schmoll is a difficult man to mark. And Tuesday night at Soldiers Field, Boston College discovered that the hard way.
With the score tied at two in the first overtime of the Crimson men’s soccer team’s home opener, Harvard earned a corner with five minutes remaining in the contest.
Freshman midfielder Christian Sady sent the ball flying toward the near post, and Schmoll was there to head it home, launching the Crimson (1-3-0) to its first victory of the season by a score of 3-2.
“It’s an unbelievable feeling,” Schmoll said. “But again, [it was] a huge team effort. One day it will be me; tomorrow it will be another guy. We’re just confident in what we do well, so we’ll keep doing it.”
Harvard had previously been well on track to earn the win in regulation. Leading 2-1 in the closing stages of the game, the Crimson went up a man after Eagles’ midfielder Derrick Boateng was sent off for kneeing Harvard midfielder Oliver White.
But the Eagles (3-2-1) put any celebration on hold in the 88th minute.
Following a Crimson clearance, Boston College mounted a threat by launching the ball right back into Harvard territory.
In the midst of a crowded backfield, the ball bounced off a series of legs before making its way to the foot of the Eagles’ leading scorer Isaac Normesinu, who buried the equalizer in the back of the net.
Normesinu, Boateng, and sophomore midfielder Zeiko Lewis were responsible for much of the Boston College offense throughout the night. Together, the three attackers have scored eight of the team’s ten goals this season, and they combined for seven shots against the Crimson.
“We tailored our game to be very aware of [those] center midfielders,” Schmoll said. “They were a good trio of dangerous players, [so] they’re going to get the ball. But I think we did pretty well as a team, knowing what our tactic was and executing.”
According to Schmoll, Harvard was able to bounce back after surrendering the game-tying goal by maintaining its composure and remaining vocal on the field.
“Anyone who has any input to say at any point in the game, from the bench or on the field, is going to speak up and say it, and that’s the great thing about this team,” Schmoll said. “Everyone on this team is a leader.”
The Crimson played with a lead for the majority of the second half courtesy of a goal late in the first by co-captain Kyle Henderson.
The senior had his initial shot sent aside by Eagles’ goalkeeper Alex Kapp, but the ball eventually found its way back to Henderson, who finished his second opportunity from the center of the box.
The build-up that led to Henderson’s goal proved very similar to that of the tally that initially put Harvard in the scoring column. After conceding a fourth minute goal to Boston College forward Phil Sandgren, the Crimson managed to break even in the 22nd minute.
Shortly after entering the game as a substitute, White sent a rocket toward the net, which was saved by Kapp—one of his career-high nine stops for the contest.
But the ball ricocheted off the goalkeeper’s hands, allowing sophomore defenseman Daniel Smith to score on the rebound after fighting through the Eagles’ defense.
“The guys work unbelievably hard,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “They are edgy, they fight, they’re competitive, and they’re supportive of the other guys. [The season] was going to turn, and it’s going to continue to.”
The Crimson recorded 21 shots on the game, tying its season high, with 11 different players getting their names on the stat sheet.
On the other side of the ball, Boston College had just 13 shots, five of which were saved by Harvard goalkeeper Evan Mendez.
“[Boston College] is a great team,” Lehrer said. “They’re always going to be [near] the top 20. [Eagles coach Ed Kelly] runs a phenomenal program there. We have to be successful against a team like that to do well in the tournament, and that’s really what we’re looking for.”
