After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall will be the second dorm to undergo renovation as part of the College’s House Renewal project, following the completion of construction on Old Quincy in the 2012-13 school year.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced Thursday that the building, known as “Old Leverett,” will undergo a 15-month renovation, with construction beginning as early as June 2013.
Smith called the Leverett renovation a “test project” for the larger House Renewal program—the College’s complete overhaul of its 12 residential Houses, which will not officially begin until after the Quincy and Leverett renovations. Old Leverett will allow the College to grapple with design elements like a dining hall, House Masters' residence, and House common spaces that, while absent from Old Quincy, are essential to a full residential House.
“It is critical that we carefully design concepts before launching a systemwide effort,” Smith said in a release.
Last spring, House Masters speculated that Harvard would next choose Old Leverett to renovate because, like Old Quincy, it is smaller than an entire House and requires the displacement of fewer students.
The 180 students who live in Old Leverett will be housed in the same three apartment buildings chosen to host Old Quincy residents in the coming academic year—Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton St., Fairfax Hall at 1306 Mass. Avenue, and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn St. The Leverett dining hall in McKinlock will remain open during the academic year, and administrators have said that the construction on the kitchen and dining hall will occur during the summer.
Architectural plans for Old Leverett should be completed by next fall. According to Smith, the changes to Old Leverett will be similar to those planned for the Quincy renovation. Major updates to Old Quincy will include the addition of elevators and the elimination of walk-through bedrooms.
The funding for the Old Quincy and Old Leverett projects will come from a mix of private philanthropy and internal funds, Smith said, declining to comment on the total sums the renovations will need. Smith said that the House Renewal project will be one of the top priorities for FAS in the University’s upcoming capital campaign.
No timeline exists yet for the full House Renewal program, and Smith said that the timing of an announcement will be tied to the availability of funding.
Harvard announced the choice of Old Quincy for the test project last January, and, in May, administrators unveiled the plans designed by the architectural firm KieranTimberlake, which also oversaw the recently concluded overhaul of Yale’s Residential Colleges.
Smith identified the three Harvard University-owned apartment buildings as the “swing space” for displaced Quincy residents in April. Before the College begins renovation of a full House—including dining halls, masters residences, and common spaces—Smith has said that a location for a full “swing House” will need to be identified. He said that no decision has been made about plans for the renovation or building of a swing house at this time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A little less than a year ago, the Harvard men's basketball team traveled to Hartford, Conn., to face a University of Connecticut team that was riding a nine-game winning streak that included three victories at the Maui Invitational. The Crimson fell to the eventual national champion Huskies, 81-52, behind 20 points from the No. 9 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, Kemba Walker.
Thursday evening, No. 24/25 Harvard (8-0) returns to Connecticut to face No. 9 UConn (7-1) and boasts a similar resumé to that of the Huskies a year ago. The Crimson is riding an eight-game winning streak, one punctuated by its triumph at the Battle 4 Atlantis, a Bahamas tournament in which UConn came in third.
Harvard did not face the Huskies at Atlantis, instead meeting in the finals the University of Central Florida–which had upset UConn in the semis.
"We know that they're good," Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. "And we know that they beat us by maybe 150 points last year, and so we're excited to play and get another shot at them."
All hyperbole aside, last year’s matchup was quite the shellacking, as Harvard was outrebounded, 39-27, by a Huskies team that not only looked bigger and more athletic, but also much more confident.
But that may have changed, as the Crimson enter Thursday's showdown brimming with confidence from its championship in the Bahamas.
“We did [beat a big and athletic team] against Florida State, so hopefully we can use some of things that we tried there," Amaker said. "The difference is we're not going to sneak up on anyone this time around."
Despite being the underdogs (according to Vegas the Huskies are 6.5-point favorites) it is Harvard, not UConn, which carries the momentum into this early season matchup. Riding the wave from the Battle 4 Atlantis, the Crimson took care of business against Vermont and Seattle last week, securing a top-25 ranking for the first time in program history, and becoming media and campus darlings in the process.
"There's been a lot of positive good will for our players," Amaker said. “So many folks on campus, classmates, employees, everyone, are really proud of them, and have let them know that. I'm just pleased to see our guys so happy.”
The buzz surrounding this team will only continue to grow if Harvard can come away with a victory Thursday, but doing so will be no easy task.
“They’re a really good team,” co-captain guard Oliver McNally said. “They have a bunch of future NBA guys, and so it’s going to be really tough.”
The Huskies may have lost Walker, but the squad still boasts a potent lineup led by freshman big Andre Drummond and sophomore shooting guard Jeremy Lamb. According to NBAdraft.net,the two project as the No. 1 and No. 2 picks, respectively, should they declare for the upcoming draft.
“They’re not a one-man team, and they haven’t been for years,” Amaker said. “[UConn] coach [Jim] Calhoun has built a juggernaut, and they’re going to be as good, or better, than anyone we will face all year. We’re just going to show up and compete, and try to have some fun along the way.”
The Crimson has its fair share of talent but will be hard-pressed to individually match up with the stars on the Huskies’ roster. And so it will take a team effort to come away with what would be the program’s first win over a top-10 opponent in history. Luckily for Amaker and his staff, Harvard has displayed an incredible amount of depth and unselfishness early in this season, boasting a rotation that goes 10-deep.
Key in providing this depth has been a very involved freshman class. The cornerstones of the Crimson remain the frontcourt duo of reigning Ivy League Player of the Year co-captain Keith Wright and junior Kyle Casey, and backcourt maestro Brandyn Curry, but the contributions of the freshman class may prove essential in coming away with a victory Thursday.
Freshman guards Corbin Miller and Wesley Saunders have provided a scoring spark off the bench while rookie forwards Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis have been two of the top rebounders on the team while also bringing a tenacity and toughness to the defense that has helped the Crimson keep four of its last five opponents to under 50 points.
"We're going to do our best to have a solid team rebounding performance against their big and athletic guys," Amaker said. "It's also going to be very hard to guard their trio of guys on the perimeter. It's a very, very difficult task. They're one of the greatest programs in all of college basketball, so we're thrilled to be able to compete against them."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, Conn.—For a half, at least, Harvard proved it belonged.
After earning the first national ranking in the program’s 101-year history this week, the No. 24/25 Crimson men’s basketball team was thrown right into the fire, playing defending NCAA champion No. 9/9 UConn on national television in front of a sellout crowd at Gampel Pavilion.
Harvard (8-1) hung tough through the first half against the NBA-level skills of Jeremy Lamb, Shabazz Napier, Andre Drummond, and others, and went into the break down just 30-28.
But in the second, the Huskies (8-1) proved to be too talented for the nation’s new favorite underdog, coming out of the locker room with a 15-2 run and never looking back en route to a 67-53 victory.
“Overall [it was] a pretty good performance against a team that will probably win 25, 26, 27 games,” said UConn Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun. “That’s a pretty good team we just beat.”
Down two with the ball coming out of the first half, junior forward Christian Webster missed an open three that would have given Harvard the lead. Lamb responded by knocking down a trey at the other end to put UConn up five.
“We had to come out with defensive intensity,” said Lamb, who finished with a game-high 18 points and seven rebounds. “They’re a real hardworking team, and we knew we needed to get stops to make a run.”
Neither team scored for three minutes after that, but Napier drilled a long ball with 16:24 to go to put the Huskies up, 36-28.
Co-captain Keith Wright responded at the other end with a layup, but UConn came right back with a three from Ryan Boatwright—the final piece of the Huskies talented trio of guards—to extend the Connecticut lead back to nine.
“I think they increased the pressure, forced us into some bad things and some quick things,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Their perimeter play was outstanding.”
Junior guard Brandyn Curry was fouled on Harvard’s next possession and hit one-of-two from the line, but UConn then went on an 8-0 run highlighted by two Lamb jumpers to extend the Huskies’ advantage to 47-31.
The Crimson answered with an 8-0 run of its own on a Laurent Rivard three and five Wright points to cut the deficit to eight with 10:08 left.  But then it was UConn’s turn for another spurt, and after a Drummond dunk, Lamb three, and Boatwright jumper, the lead was back up to 54-39 three minutes later.
“We tried our best to make a run at it, but they’re so crafty with the ball and certainly what they can do on the backboard limited our effectiveness around the goal,” Amaker said. “We couldn’t get anything easy around the basket.”
The Crimson was able to cut the deficit back to seven, 58-51, after a Casey three with 4:51 remaining, but Tyler Olander responded with a jumper, and Curry and Casey turned the ball over on Harvard’s next two possessions.
Rivard missed back-to-back threes as the game wound down, and the lead escalated to 14 at 67-53 on two Boatright free throws with 1:04 left. That’s where the final score would stand, with the loss ending the Crimson’s perfect season and likely knocking it out of the Top 25 a week after it entered.
“They beat Central Florida and Central Florida came back against us down 17 [at the Battle 4 Atlantis],” Calhoun said. “I told the kids that wasn’t happening tonight.”
But the Crimson battled and hung with the Huskies throughout the first half despite being undersized in the frontcourt and less athletic in the backcourt.
The teams went back-and-forth for the game’s first 12 minutes, with neither team able to take a lead of more than three. Harvard got out to a quick 7-4 advantage on a Webster three and a Curry-to-Casey alley-oop, but UConn came right back with a 5-0 run capped by a DeAndre Daniels long ball.
With 6:44 left in the half, the Huskies opened up a nine-point lead at 28-19 with a 7-0 run that was capped by a Napier jumper. But UConn scored just one more time before the period’s end, and Harvard got back within two on a Webster three and Curry free throw before the break.
“I think we played a tremendous first half,” Amaker said. “[But] they’re very talented, very big. … They’re just almost unguardable.”
The Crimson struggled inside defensively and offensively throughout the night, getting outrebounded 35-28 and outscored 30-18 in the paint. Wright—the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year—in particular had a tough time against projected NBA top-five pick Drummond, shooting just 3-10 from the field.
“They bothered [Wright],” Amaker said. “It wasn’t anything intricate or tricky; they’re tremendous upfront at being shot-deflectors and intimidators.”
But on the whole, the coach believed his team showed a lot of improvement from a year ago, when it lost 81-52 to the Huskies in Hartford.
“I was very pleased with the effort we brought,” Amaker said. “I thought we came here with the idea of winning and we played with that spirit. … [But] we have a long way to go.”

If the Crimson wanted to prove they belong in the top 25, this would be the team to play. And if a Harvard fan wanted to get a taste of big-time college athletics, this would be the game to attend.
Tonight, the Harvard men's basketball team will play in Storrs, Conn., home to the University of Connecticut and one of the best college basketball programs in the country. The Huskies are the defending national champions and are currently ranked ninth in the nation.
To get a taste of the action, dozens of Crimson faithfuls are expected to follow the team to Storrs.
"I'm fucking amped. I've secretly always wanted to go to a school with relevant sports teams," Josiah B. Bonsey '14 said of attending the matchup. "For Harvard to be relevant...and getting an opportunity to take on the former national champion that happens to be pretty close by? We might not get this kind of opportunity again. Hopefully we do, but we might as well take advantage of it."
Of course, for many students, making the 90-minute trek is not a possibility late in reading week. For those who are unable to cheer on the Crimson at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion, there will be several ways to follow along from campus. The game will be broadcast on ESPN2 and online at ESPN3.com. GoCrimson.com will provide a live audio feed as well as up-to-the-minute stats. You can also tune your dial to WHRB—Harvard's radio station—at 95.3 FM for their call of the game starting at 6:45 p.m. Their broadcast will be streamed simultaneously on their website, whrb.org.
