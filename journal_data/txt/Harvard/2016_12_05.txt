After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a member of the Faculty Council, I have participated in a series of long discussions on a motion that Professor Harry Lewis presented to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Ordinarily, the Faculty Council votes on motions before they are presented to the entire Faculty. In this case, however, the Faculty Council took the highly unusual step of declining to vote on the motion. I would like to explain to the entire Harvard College community why I concur with the decision not to vote and why this motion is harmful to the Faculty.
The motion reads, “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join, nor political parties with which they affiliate, nor social, political or other affinity groups they join, as long as those organizations, parties, or groups have not been judged to be illegal.” Supporters have said explicitly that they expect its passage to force the College to rescind its new policy of sanctioning members of final clubs and other unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Whatever the expectations of its supporters, the motion does not refer to the policy at all. Rather, it simply calls on the Faculty to state its opposition to discrimination. Or, to be more precise, it calls on the Faculty to reaffirm its opposition to discrimination. The Harvard College Handbook for Students already includes a strong statement against discrimination: “Discrimination based on race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability, military service, or any other legally protected basis is contrary to the principles and policies of Harvard University.”
Based on the actual language of the motion, it is not at all clear that a “yes” vote by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences would require the College to rescind the policy. All I can say for sure is that voting “yes” would be redundant insofar as it would simply reaffirm a general anti-discrimination policy already in place.
Redundancy by itself is inefficient but perhaps not harmful. However, given the expectations of many of the motion’s supporters, there is a danger of real harm to the Faculty and Harvard more generally in passing a motion that may not achieve its proponents’ aims. Therefore, I could not vote in support of the motion.
If I could not vote in favor of the motion, why not vote against it? Again, I looked to the language of the motion, which refers only to discrimination on the basis of membership in various organizations. I do not oppose the freedom of association as a matter of general principle. Given the wording of the motion, a “no” vote would be, in effect, a vote in favor of discrimination. Voting “no,” with its absolutely false suggestion that the Harvard Faculty embraces discrimination, would do real harm to the Faculty and Harvard more generally.
I welcome robust debate on the College’s policy regarding unrecognized single-gender social organizations. I have my personal opinion, as do my fellow Council members. Regarding the Lewis motion, however, the Faculty Council reached a clear conclusion. The motion is flawed because its wording and its apparent intent do not align. I continue to believe that whether “yes” or “no,” a vote would harm the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard University. Therefore, I declined to vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
On any given day in Harvard Square, a pedestrian will pass about a dozen poor and hungry homeless people. Knowing that you cannot lift them out of poverty with a few bucks, or satiate their hunger with one bagel you snagged from the dining hall, you might ignore the homeless altogether. But I write to implore my fellow Harvard students—especially those considering entering finance and consulting—to embrace the discomfort they feel in these situations. That uncomfortable feeling is called injustice.
According to the author of a recent Crimson column, you can solve such social injustices by entering finance, contrary to popular opinion. The author claims the “trajectory of social progress” is hurtling toward private sector philanthropy, or “philanthrocapitalism.”  Although he implores readers “not to sell out, but to buy in” to his vision of private-public partnerships, I would implore him to consider that many social problems demand political solutions—solutions only the public sector can realize.
The editorial’s dismissive tone derives from its condemnation of supposedly preachy social justice advocates who have attached a stigma to the preferred career path of many Harvard students. Those who pursue “noble” careers patronize those who would seek careers in finance or consulting. It might be true that, if you want to make a lot of money by entering finance, anyone who vilifies your career choice appears to be a “pedantic social worker who is basically a missionary in his ideological rigidity,” instead of a person with genuine convictions who is trying to effect social progress. This misrepresentation is a knee-jerk reaction that dismisses the importance of non-profit and public sector work, and it justifies pursuing lucrative careers based on coldly calculated measures of their potential social impact.
Unfortunately, the grim reality of society’s woes does not welcome such a neat and tidy solution. So-called philanthrocapitalism will not solve global poverty and hunger, increasing economic inequality, or systemic racism. Some private sector enterprises could certainly make progress in solving some problems. But to fairly redistribute wealth and cement minority rights, we must either act through established political institutions or seek to replace them. Big business has attempted to thwart efforts to advance civil rights throughout American history. They have lobbied against minimum wage increases, fought to dismantle unions, and discriminated against some customers on the basis of race, ethnicity, and/or sexual orientation. We cannot secure political solutions through the private sector.
By overvaluing efficiency, the author detaches himself from the uncomfortable reality of social ills—a reality that should provoke deep discomfort. If future financiers and consultants genuinely want to solve social problems, they do not need to join the Peace Corps, nor do they need to run and hide behind their self-congratulatory justifications of corporate careers. But they cannot dismiss the legitimate criticisms that social justice advocates levy against the outsized influence of largely unregulated investment banks. Through dubious tactics these banks have gambled away people’s homes and destroyed lives, and only government-imposed regulations can prevent that from happening again.
No amount of money Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet throw at private sector charities can resolve injustices that demand urgent political solutions. We must not allow private sector charity to drill the final nails into the welfare state’s coffin; we must not sacrifice civil rights and political solutions to global social ills on the altar of so-called philanthrocapitalism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Institute of Politics announced that Stephen K. Bannon would attend its customary two-day post-mortem of the presidential campaign, the backlash among members of the Harvard and Boston communities was swift. The former Breitbart News executive whom President-elect Donald J. Trump has appointed as his chief strategist is rightly considered to represent one of the most odious aspects of the Trump phenomenon: the enabling of prejudice for political gain. Though Bannon did not end up attending the event due to a scheduling change, students and citizens protested the IOP, many arguing that he should not have received an invitation at all—lest Harvard normalize Bannon and thus the hateful elements of Trump’s campaign.
There is validity to this concern. To accept Trump’s rhetoric wholesale would be to ignore the acts of hate it has inspired and the human consequences of his proposed policies on issues like immigration. Protesting and rejecting the worst impulses of the Trump campaign and administration will remain necessary over the course of the next four years.
As upsetting as it is, however, Trump’s victory is a reality that demands understanding. Though Bannon’s appointment dismays the millions of Americans his vision of our country excludes, in all likelihood, he will remain at the center of power for years to come. Ultimately, Harvard and the IOP have a responsibility to ensure that both this community and the wider public understand just what kind of political and ideological priorities people like Bannon will bring with them to the White House.
We do not make this claim lightly. Extending Bannon an invitation to the IOP undoubtedly lends a certain imprimatur of legitimacy to his views. Nevertheless, even worse would be the implicit normalization of ignoring them. Harvard as an institution has the privilege and the duty to educate its students and the public about the world, including its less savory aspects.
Perhaps worse than ignorance is the reliance on stigma. It is IOP tradition to invite the presidential campaign managers after the electoral campaign, and breaking tradition would have sent shockwaves over a mere discussion of the election. It would be wiser for Bannon’s opponents to save such a powerful move for specific policies instead of general disapproval of rhetoric for two reasons. First, to play one’s strongest card over a relatively minor event would reduce its effectiveness if and when something worse occurs. Second, disinviting Bannon and Trump over more abstract accusations of prejudice risks making them appealing as enemies of political correctness and mainstream institutions. While their appeal to these sentiments is distasteful and only effective to a certain extent, the polarization of the country demands a degree of conciliation that is not compatible with a blanket refusal to engage the other side.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I started college, I counted myself as one of the 71 percent of Harvard’s student body that identify as liberal. Back then, I believed in the benefits of government programs and the importance of regulating private interests. As I have grown older and gained more experience, I’ve become skeptical of these narrow commitments and my past tendency to identify as a liberal and Democrat. I have even become skeptical of the identity politics employed by liberals and conservatives that may have led us to elect Donald Trump as our president.
Mark Lilla wrote in the New York Times that this year’s election and its outcome must teach us “that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end.” He contends that an odd fixation on diversity has made many progressives aware of little outside their self-defined identity groups. And when one considers the campaign Hillary Clinton ran, in which she called African Americans, LGBTQ persons, Latinos, and women to vote with little mention of the uneducated, males, or whites, it’s of little surprise to Lilla that the fixation on diversity has allowed the latter to come together as an identity group to vote Trump into power. Instead, as Lilla argues, Clinton should have provided a unifying vision that focused on commonalities rather than differences.
I agree with Lilla, but he fails to explain how identity politics obfuscates what really matters in bonding people: experience.
Take, for example, my so-called Hispanic identity. What would you know about me when I say that I am Hispanic? Would you think I am disadvantaged and discriminated against? Would you be surprised to know that Hispanic people didn’t make up most of the people I knew back home? Or that I enjoyed a great public school education in a wealthy county?
There is a variety of experience that makes up who I am that has nothing to do with being Hispanic. For one, it seems unfair to me to say that I am at Harvard despite the disadvantages of being Hispanic. Sure, my Guatemalan father was a cook, and my Salvadorian mother cleans homes, and neither earns all that much. But they have given me values and experiences—values and experiences that are not exclusive to Hispanic people—that I could build upon to end up here at Harvard.
Furthermore, there’s nothing about me that makes me think that I ended up at Harvard because I’m Hispanic. I know that I am not among the most talented, but I do know that I am smart enough and work hard enough to contribute to others’ experience of Harvard, like all the other people here. In other words, I am not here just because Harvard had to fill a quota.
At the individual level, then, an identity can’t be captured by concepts of race, gender, or any other category.  Saying that I am Hispanic does not tell much about me and my experiences besides that at least one of my parents is Hispanic. What actually gives you an idea of who I am are my decisions and experiences.
An identity is little more than what one does, the accumulation of decisions and experiences one makes. An identity built on anything else would be irreparably fragile in the face of the diversity of experiences people have, like my Hispanic identity given my various experiences.
At a greater scale, ascribing or self-ascribing an identity to a group of people on the basis of certain categories also doesn’t make sense. Gather any group of people of European descent, identify the group as white, and there will be difficulty in finding any other experiences that would be common to every member of the group.
Nor does it make sense that a block of white, uneducated people voted for Trump should be judged as a monolithic group based on their vote. These voters are diverse in their individual identities and experiences. We have seen both the aspirational and the ugly in them. And it’s not entirely clear whether Trump was elected because of racist attitudes or economic worries. The only thing that is capital-T True is that the smaller group of people that brought Trump to the White House come from rural environments which produce a certain kind of experience, none of which could inherently be called racist or economic.
Even at these greater scales identities are about everyday experiences, and those are the things that bond. Individual experiences act as bonds between past and future selves, helping form a continuous whole. And group experiences act as bonds between people which contribute to a happy union.
Take this op-ed, for example. My word is bond for my identity. Your reading is bond for your identity. Our communicating is bond for our group identity. No matter my self-ascribed identity or your self-ascribed identity the experience we share through these written and read words is what makes us common.  This, among many other experiences, is the only thing that makes up who you and I are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council has declined to vote on a motion opposing the College’s historic sanctions against members of final clubs, fraternities, and sororities, citing uncertainty about whether a vote for the motion would impact the policy.
One member of the Council, Japanese history professor David L. Howell, will also abstain from the upcoming Faculty-wide vote on the motion, which states that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.” The motion will go to a vote Tuesday at the monthly Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, according to a meeting agenda obtained by The Crimson. The 18-member Faculty Council usually votes on Faculty-wide proposals before the monthly meetings take place.
Spearheaded by computer science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, the motion argues that the College’s policy infringes upon students’ freedom of association. Proponents of the motion say a Faculty vote would revoke the sanctions, which, starting with the Class of 2021, prohibit members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding varsity captaincies, becoming leaders of recognized student groups, or receiving College endorsement for top fellowships.
In an op-ed published in The Crimson Sunday, Howell wrote it was “highly unusual” for the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—to decline to vote on a motion. Though the Faculty Council has discussed the motion at several times, they have chosen not to vote on it at any of their meetings, including two in November, because the proposed legislation does not specifically mention the College’s policy.
In an interview, Howell said members of the Council had mixed feelings on the policy itself, but that “there was a consensus that the motion was so flawed in its wording that it was impossible to vote.”
Howell said it is unclear whether a “yes” vote would force the College to rescind the policy. But a “no” vote would appear to be in favor of discrimination, Howell argued.
“I think it’s hard for the Faculty to vote either yes or no, because on the one hand it’s not clear whether a yes vote would really require a change in the policy or what kind of change, or just a repudiation of the policy,” Howell said. “And then a no vote would be embarrassing, because no one really is against freedom of association.”
In the op-ed, Howell also wrote that the motion is redundant “insofar as it would simply reaffirm a general anti-discrimination policy already in place.” The College’s student handbook prohibits discrimination based on “race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, creed, national origin, age, ancestry, veteran status, disability, military service, or any other legally protected basis.”
In an email Sunday, Lewis questioned Howell’s claim, writing that he could not “find anything in [the College’s handbook] that would cover membership in clubs or other organizations.”
“Professor Howell’s op-ed raises a question as to whether existing nondiscrimination policies prohibit discriminating against students simply because they belong to certain clubs,” Lewis wrote. “If existing policies do prohibit that, then the new College policy is contrary to existing Harvard nondiscrimination policies and should be withdrawn immediately, without further action by the Faculty. If existing policies don’t prohibit that form of discrimination, then our motion is properly formulated to prevent it.”
In advance of the Faculty meeting, Lewis and College administrators each released “Frequently Asked Questions” documents describing their cases for and against the motion, respectively. In his FAQ document, Lewis addressed why the motion’s authors did not create legislation specifically against the policy, writing that he believed the Faculty is not sufficiently informed to legislate on final clubs and Greek life at Harvard. He added that the motion establishes an “important institutional principle” that the Faculty is “competent to affirm or reject.”
Administrators and professors alike have questioned whether the Faculty has the power to overturn the policy should they vote in favor of the motion Tuesday.
“It’s not clear to me personally that passing the motion the way that it’s worded would automatically force the College to rescind the policy,” Howell said. “I think it’s just not a good idea for us to be voting on things [when] it’s not clear what happens if we vote yes or if we vote no.”
Howell also said it is unclear whether the Faculty has jurisdiction over the policy at all. While the Faculty votes regularly on changes to the student handbook, Howell said he is unsure whether the sanctions will be included in the handbook.
“I think there’s a case to be made that it should’ve been brought to the Faculty ahead of time, but also that it’s an internal routine,” Howell said. “It’s a big rule, but in terms of its format, it could be a kind of routine rulemaking procedure that need not be brought to the whole Faculty. I’m actually not sure myself.”
While Howell says he is unsure which way the vote on the motion will go, he said “anecdotally” that many professors share his confusion. He anticipates another large turnout for Tuesday’s meeting. University President Drew G. Faust has said that the policy could be subject to change after faculty consultation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 7, 2016, at 1:14 a.m.
Harvard has paid railroad company CSX Transportation $147.3 million as one of the final steps of a land acquisition deal begun more than a decade ago.
In 2000, Harvard bought a 47-acre parcel of land—owned by CSX and known as Allston North Landing—for more than $150 million. The railroad company retained easement rights on almost 20 acres of that land, allowing CSX to temporarily continue railroad operations in the area. At the time of purchase, the properties held train tracks, as well as personnel and mechanical buildings. 
The structures themselves lie south of Harvard's current construction sites in the neighborhood, including its most ambitious project, the new complex for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
After Harvard’s recent payment, completed Nov. 17, CSX yielded its easement rights for the entire property to the University following environmental remediation, Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey told Banker and Tradesman, a Boston-based weekly business publication.
“This closing represents another step in a series of events agreed to by CSX and Harvard in 2007 and unfolding since,” Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement. “Under the agreement, CSXT has relocated business operations, removed structures, conducted environmental testing and remediation necessary to meet Massachusetts standards and, finally, executed the closing late last month.”
In 2007, Harvard and CSX finalized plans to phase CSX facilities out of the area, as the company’s rail operations relocated to Westborough and Worcester, according to Casey. A year ago, the two formally reached a deal giving Harvard full rights to the site so that it could develop on all land formerly used by CSX.
Two-thirds of the SEAS faculty are slated to move across the Charles River in 2020.
Harvard has laid out a 10-year scheme for its Allston expansion in an Institutional Master Plan approved in 2013 by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, then the name for Boston’s urban planning body. The plan designates Allston Landing North as the site of both the $1 billion SEAS building and a new park. The park would comprise part of a “greenway” of parkland envisioned to connect Harvard’s Allston developments.
Allston resident Harry E. Mattison said he was pleased to hear of the new transaction between Harvard and CSX, though he emphasized he did not fully understand the terms of the agreement, which he deemed “very complicated.” He said he believes Allston residents are generally “excited” by Harvard’s planned developments on Allston North Landing.
“In general, I think it’s very exciting to think that acres of abandoned or underutilized land will have a productive future for the University and the neighborhood and the city and the state,” he said.
Mattison expressed concern, however, that the development process may proceed too slowly—a sentiment he said many Allstonians share.
“I think people hope that it happens sooner rather than later,” he said. “You know, in our lifetimes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, who won last month’s Undergraduate Council presidential election, were sworn in as next year’s President and Vice President of the UC during Sunday’s general meeting.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair administered the inauguration ceremony, during which Sachee and Khansarinia swore the UC’s oath of office and took over leadership of the Council from previous UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17.
During her opening remarks as president, Sachee emphasized the importance of unifying the Council under their “shared goal” of “serving the student body.” In his remarks, Khansarinia said he would work to create an efficient Council, but urged representatives to speak up even if they held unpopular opinions.
“Efficiency should not leave out dissension. Efficiency should not leave out discussion,” Khansarinia said.
Rather and Banks, in their closing remarks, reflected on their time in UC leadership and gave advice to the incoming leaders. Rather emphasized the importance of having a vision for the Council and for campus, and Banks spoke about the importance of continuing to work to better campus despite inevitable failures along the way.
“There is no student sitting on the Board of Overseers; there is no freshman grill. There are so many things we failed at,” Banks said. “But know that failure is fleeting, and you can move on and keep going.”
The UC also held elections Sunday for next year’s secretary and treasurer.
Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 was elected UC treasurer in a race against Crimson Yard representative Nadine Khoury ’20 and Quincy House representative Olu Oisaghie ’19. Leverett House representative Ruiqi He ’19 was elected UC secretary in a six-way race for the position.
Also serving on next year’s UC Executive Board will be newly elected Finance Committee Chair Neel Mehta ’18 and re-elected Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18.
The Council also passed its final grants pack of the semester, sponsored by UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17. Greenlaw emphasized the success of his committee’s sexual assault prevention training program, which held its most recent training last week.
“We are almost near the 200 mark for the number of people we have successfully trained in sexual assault prevention since this program began,” Greenlaw said.
The UC also passed two freshman-focused pieces of legislation at Sunday’s meeting. The first, sponsored by Oak Yard representative Katie Wang ’20, allocated $500 for improvements and repairs for freshman common rooms. Wang, a Crimson contributing news writer and designer, said the funds would be used for small-scale improvements such as replacing markers and adding new plants to common rooms.
The second piece of legislation allocated an additional $500 for party equipment as part of the UC’s larger “Everything But Alcohol” initiative. Ivy Yard representative Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who sponsored the legislation with Wang and Oak Yard representative Michael Scherr ’20, said the legislation could allow the Freshman Class Committee to rent out party materials to freshmen.
“We would also be able to tailor the program in the future based on how many people are requesting certain items,” Palaniappan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of a contentious Faculty meeting, College administrators and computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 have circulated documents to lobby faculty members with their respective arguments about historic penalties against members of single-gender social organizations.
The two "Frequently Asked Questions" documents, which were emailed to Faculty along with the agenda for Tuesday’s monthly meeting, raise pointed questions about the place of final clubs, sororities, and fraternities at Harvard and the role of faculty members in shaping undergraduate social life. At the meeting, the Faculty will vote on a motion arguing that Harvard should not penalize students for their involvement in Greek life or final clubs.
Last May, after a year of meeting with final club leaders behind closed doors, Harvard administrators announced a unprecedented policy barring members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, starting with the Class of 2021, from becoming captains of varsity teams, holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, or receiving College-endorsement for top fellowships.
Responding to the policy, Lewis and 11 other professors in May crafted the motion, which resolves that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
It is unclear if the motion, which does not explicitly mention the policy, would have the power to overturn the sanctions—though the motion’s supporters believe so.
In his FAQ document, titled “Further Q&A in support of the Nondiscrimination Motion,” Lewis responded to the question “Isn’t voting for this motion going to be taken as an endorsement of the final clubs?” He wrote that the motion is not an affirmation of the unrecognized groups.
“To oppose the motion because favoring it will be interpreted as favoring clubs we despise is like opposing the First Amendment because favoring it may be interpreted as being in favor of flag-burning,” Lewis wrote. “We can be in favor of the motion and in favor of the First Amendment without being in favor of the final clubs and flag-burning.”
The College administrators’ FAQ document focuses on the issues of exclusivity, discrimination, and sexual assault associated with the unrecognized social groups. The document also includes a list outlining the groups that currently exist, how many students are members, and where are they located.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane confirmed that College administrators wrote the College's FAQ document, but declined to name specific authors.
In their FAQ, administrators also criticize the unrecognized single-gender organizations for promoting “aggressively discriminatory practices.” They also argue that “it is past time” to curb the influence of such organizations at Harvard, given several analyses and reports about final clubs created over the past two decades.
“Given this context, the College has come to the judgment that it cannot continue business as usual while these organizations proliferate and the real consequences for student social life and the overall student experience become more acute,” the administrators’ document reads.
The document also includes a list of unrecognized social organizations on campus—seven all-male final clubs, the co-ed Spee Club, five all-female final clubs, and nine sororities and fraternities—and estimates that 25 to 30 percent of undergraduates belong to unrecognized single-gender social organizations. While the College’s concerns have “historically been about the behavior and practices of male clubs,” the document reads, both male and female organizations “exclude on the basis of gender” and are inconsistent “with the Faculty’s long-held view that the College should not become a Greek school.”
While the administrators’ FAQ indicates that the policy will not “fully solve the problems of exclusivity and student safety,” the document’s authors write that “the policy was adopted with the expectation that it is an important step toward improving culture.”
In his FAQ document, Lewis criticizes administrators for not informing or working with the Faculty  before announcing the sanctions.
“Policies about single-gender organizations should be worked out cooperatively by faculty, students and the university administration,” Lewis wrote. “It is, however, not shared governance for the president and dean to announce policies and then share merely the implementation details with the Faculty.”
It remains unclear whether the faculty motion could have the power to modify or override the sanctions. While top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72, have said the policy will not be nullified, Lewis wrote in his FAQ document that the policy falls under the Faculty’s jurisdiction.
Responding to the question “Why didn’t you just make a motion against the policy?” Lewis wrote that he believes the Faculty is not sufficiently informed to legislate on undergraduate social life.
Last month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith sent the Faculty a PDF that contained five years of candid undergraduate survey responses which used the words “final club,” “sorority,” or “fraternity.” Smith wrote that the Faculty may use the information to “further inform” their upcoming vote on the motion.
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser will present a report on “faculty trends,” according to the meeting agenda. In addition, the Faculty will vote to approve the list of summer school courses for 2017.

The Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services is discontinuing its annual National Alcohol Screening Day, an event intended to evaluate students’ drinking habits made popular by its distribution of free CamelBak water bottles.
At previous NASD outreach events, sponsored by AODS and the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, participants completed anonymous surveys about their alcohol consumption followed by a private consultation with a health professional to discuss their results.
Garrett O. Fitzgerald, in his first semester as director of AODS, said his office decided to cancel the event due to budget constraints, the inefficiency NASD had targeting “high-risk” students, and the inability to make “general assumptions” based on the collected data. He added that conversations to cancel the event had already begun before he joined AODS in August.
“The challenge that we were facing, in somewhat of a limited budget situation is: Are we having the type of reach, the type of engagement with the students that need our assistance, and is this the most effective use of our resources?” he said.
Fitzgerald described a high-risk drinker as a chronic abuser of alcohol, though that behavior may not be visibly apparent.
“It is actually very unlikely to be someone that you see become hospitalized, or even have a major incident that would be visible, because they have almost become a professional at their particular substance,” he said.
In May 2015, AODS recorded that 2,159 participants were screened, representing roughly a third of the College population. Of the participants surveyed that year, only 39 students were classified in the “higher risk” category based on self-reported responses, according to Fitzgerald, and he did not have data from the most recent NASD in December 2015.
DAPA President Alex F. Dagi ’17 wrote in an email that “the choice was not made by DAPAs, specifically, but was driven by the Office's understanding that we were not targeting those highest at risk through the event and thus the costs were not justified.”
DAPA is currently organizing other outreach events such as study breaks, yoga, and SoulCycle sessions. “We are constantly thinking about new and creative ways through which we can engage with students and inspire culture change surrounding alcohol use on campus,” Dagi wrote.
Fitzgerald did say it was difficult to discontinue NASD because the initiative—held every year since the founding of AODS in 2005—had become popular among College students.
“It became a cultural thing, which is great, but not the model that we needed for the explicit goal of reaching students that had high risk and being able to bring them in and address that need,” he said.
Fitzgerald is the third director of AODS, and came following the departure of longtime director Ryan M. Travia in the spring of 2015. Travia oversaw the 2010 NASD event at which The Crimson reported a then-record high 1,330 students participated.
DAPA declined an in-person interview, citing the organization’s policy to only respond to provide email comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Garrett O. Fitzgerald was hired in August as director of Harvard’s Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, the third in the office’s 11-year history.
His appointment comes as students and administrators debate and analyze the role of alcohol in undergraduate social life, particularly in the context of the College’s ongoing sexual assault prevention efforts.
Fitzgerald said he has thought about the role of alcohol in sexual assault since he arrived at Harvard, following the University's release of results from a sexual assault climate survey last fall and further recommendations from a University-wide task for sexual assault prevention.
“I think [the task force report] certainly informed and remained present in our conversations when we planned strategies for outreach,” he said. “What the report has definitely done is lived in basically each of our meetings where we direct any of our resources going forward and also guided, sort of, what we prioritize.”
The University task force recommended all Harvard units take measures to create more robust alcohol education programs to address the larger issue and prevalence of sexual assault on campus. At the College, the reported recommended considering policies discouraging the consumption of hard liquor.
The report charged AODS with updating Harvard Proof—the educational module used to provide information to freshmen about healthy drinking habits—and increasing grants that allow the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors to fund food and beverages at alcohol-free parties.
Fitzgerald said he hoped to provide students better opportunities for learning about substances other than alcohol and gain insight into the attitude of student groups toward hosting safer parties.
He said students must remember their responsibilities as hosts to create safe party environments and how the expectations and power structures within organizations influence practices like drinking culture and hazing.
“You do have an obligation to those people coming to the event to make sure you’re creating an experience that can be safe for them, both from a substance related aspect, to even a physical safety, to an emotional safety,” he said.
Fitzgerald discussed the difference between what types of initiatives he considers realistic compared to ideals, and said efforts such as providing alcohol education to each student organization on campus may not be feasible.
“Trying to train the 400 student groups on campus is a daunting task when the people who would be expected to do that are also students and have class demands and things of that nature,” Fitzgerald said. “Otherwise, it’s two of us trying to reach 400 students in the first couple weeks of a semester.”
Before coming to Harvard, Fitzgerald previously worked for three years at Binghamton University, a public university in New York, focusing on drug and alcohol counseling. He was motivated in his decision to move to Cambridge by the peer-education model that AODS prioritizes in its work.
The issues that Fitzgerald will face as he leads the University’s alcohol education office are different than at the time of AODS’s founding. In 2005, citing concerns over rising alcohol-related hospitalizations at Harvard University Health Services, a University-wide office for alcohol education was established upon the recommendation of a student-faculty committee.
AODS was assigned to “oversee the University’s efforts to address alcohol and health issues among its students,” according to a Crimson article from July 2005. When Ryan M. Travia, the first director, departed in 2015, he praised accomplishments like the creation of a peer education group and the standardization of alcohol enforcement policies in the Houses.
In June, AODS moved from their location at 7 Linden St. to the sixth floor of the Smith Campus Center in an effort by HUHS to consolidate its broad array of auxiliary resources. Fitzgerald’s office falls under the purview of Harvard’s Department of Health Promotion and Education, which also oversees units like the Office of Sexual Assault, Prevention and Response and the Center for Wellness.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when hate crimes against Muslim Americans have spiked to their highest levels since the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, Harvard’s Islamic Society hosted a discussion highlighting discrimination faced by Muslims in the United States on Friday.
The event was planned in “response” to Donald Trump’s recent election to the presidency, according to Anwar Omeish ’19, the society’s director of external relations. Omeish led the conversation Friday afternoon, lecturing to a packed crowd in Boylston Hall’s Fong Auditorium. Students squeezed into the room to hear, with many sitting on the floor.
Over the course of her hour-long presentation, Omeish named individuals and organizations that she said comprise a “network of Islamophobia.”
She placed particular emphasis on anti-Muslim sentiments enshrined in scholarship, and identified Harvard as an institution that acts as “a generator and amplifier” for “Islamophobic rhetoric.”
“When we [at Harvard] talk about rescuing women and children, when we talk about whether or not Islam is compatible with democracy, or about bringing democracy to the Muslim world, that is imperialist rhetoric that… continues to reify Islamophobic discourse,” Omeish said.
She also criticized Harvard for hosting Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Dutch-American author and outspoken detractor of Islam who in 2013 became a fellow of the Harvard Kennedy School’s “The Future of Diplomacy Project.” Omeish said Ali is one of a group of activists who “lead the efforts to spread misinformation” about Islam in America.
“She was leading study groups [at Harvard] on the radicalization of Muslims without being academically qualified in any way to do so,” Omeish said. “She’s called Islam ‘a destructive nihilistic cult of death.’”
Brandeis University in 2014 cancelled its plans to give Ali an honorary degree in light of her anti-Islam comments, writing in a press release that “certain of her past statements are inconsistent with Brandeis University’s values,” the New York Times reported at the time.
Attendee Henry S. Atkins ’20 said he was surprised to learn of Ali’s involvement with Harvard. “I can’t say that I think that her views have any credibility,” he said. “Those kinds of views just plain and simple don’t belong on campus.”
In addition to Ali, Omeish identified Walid Phares, one of Trump’s top foreign policy advisers, as a vocal critic of Muslims. Phares, who often appears on Fox News to discuss radical Islam, is “one of the people anti-Muslim people turn to for validation of their views,” she said.
Over the course of his controversial campaign, Trump himself often spoke about Muslims and Muslim Americans. A year ago, he called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in the wake of a massacre in San Bernardino, Calif.
In the days after Trump’s election, some Harvard students and faculty reported hate speech and harassment based on their ethnicity or disability. Harmann Singh, a first-year Harvard Law student, wrote in a recent editorial for the Boston Globe that he was called “a f***ing Muslim” by a stranger in a store near campus.
Diana L. Eck, a Lowell Faculty Dean and a professor at the Divinity School who attended Friday’s discussion, said she found Omeish’s talk “very effective.”
“I think the greatest impact of this rapid-fire presentation… was the range and detail of the sources of Islamophobia,” Eck wrote in an email. “All of us need to be more aware and discriminating in public discourse about Islam.”
Omeish herself said she thought the event went “really well,” but added that the Islamic Society is already considering “next steps.”
“We will continue applying pressure to and working with the administration to achieve our goals of funded chaplaincy, Muslim life programs, and mental health resources,” she wrote in an email. “We will continue fighting for issues that we share with our friends and allies, including declaring Harvard a sanctuary campus for Muslim and undocumented students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 30, one undergraduate member of the Owl Club had had enough. After a semester characterized by increased graduate board control over the all-male final club, whose clubhouse has in recent years regularly been the scene of raucous parties, the member tapped out an acerbic 1,500 word email to the graduate board.
“We're facing a cancer within our organization, one that will ultimately destroy the entire organism,” the undergraduate wrote. “In case your acuity has waned in the many years since you have studied on this campus, let me eliminate all ambiguity. This graduate board is the cancer.” 
In similarly strong terms, the remainder of the email criticized recent changes to club policy imposed by the graduate board in an attempt to establish more robust oversight. To that end, Owl alumni recently closed its 30 Holyoke St. clubhouse, and when it re-opens next spring only club members, not scores of party guests, will be able to step inside its doors.
The undergraduate’s email spurred an acrimonious exchange with one member of the graduate board, offering a glimpse into a wide rift between the undergraduate and graduate memberships over the fundamental character of the 120-year-old institution. It has also circulated widely among members of other final clubs. 
With changes to the policy and stricter overall supervision, the student argued that the graduate board was limiting access to what he saw as two central aspects of involvement with the Owl club: alcohol and women.
“Now, you might contend that not all bonding and fun takes place around drinking. I would respond by asking you to reflect on your own college days and be realistic,” wrote the undergraduate, a senior at the College. “For college men the only other thing that fun revolves around is girls, and there will be none to be found near the Owl with your new rules.”
Further excoriating the policy shift, the author, who declined to comment for this story, wrote that “instituting a no-guest policy strikes a blow to the heart of everything that is good in the Owl” by limiting its members’ abilities to drink and host parties.
M. Barry Bausano ’85, a member of the graduate board who sent three emailed responses to the senior, contended in an interview Sunday night that, rather than striking a death blow to the club, the alumni board’s recent actions are merely “re-establishing some reasonable governance conditions on the club and the great majority of membership is in favor of that.”
“There are some intransigent resistors, but it’s a pretty narrow slice,” Bausano, who is the CEO and President of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., said.
“The Owl cannot operate as a public conveyance for the entertainment of all and sundry undergraduates,” Bausano wrote in reply to the undergraduate, explaining the reasoning behind the new policies. “Not least for reasons of legal liability and university intolerance.”
The emails and their underlying conflict come at a particularly significant juncture in the club’s history as they, like Harvard’s six other all-male final clubs, prepare for impending penalties from the University for their single-gender status. In May of this year, Harvard announced a new policy that, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from team captaincies, leadership positions, and College endorsement for certain fellowships. In announcing the unprecedented sanctions, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust painted the clubs as bastions of discrimination and exclusivity. Final clubs have also been the subject of scrutiny for statistics—heavily disputed by the clubs themselves—linking them with instances of sexual assault and harassment.
Indeed, Bausano’s responses explicitly referenced Harvard’s recent actions against the clubs.
“[S]o your solution [to] Harvard's objections is to ‘party on dude?’. Class of 2021 and beyond be damned?” Bausano wrote in his response to the undergraduate. “Actually, this attitude is precisely why adults are required.”
In his original email, though, the undergraduate questioned whether Harvard’s actions called for changes in the Owl’s policy.
“Additionally, your egregious paternalism under the guise of ‘increasing constraints set by Harvard’ is disgusting,” the student wrote. “The undergraduates see the current environment, and Harvard is not the issue.”
The language in the senior’s email ranged from formal to blunt to profane.
“If the reason you are closing the club and destroying this organization is to protect your investment in the ‘asset’, then fuck you,” he wrote.
Bausano’s emailed responses, which adopted a less inflammatory tone than the undergraduate’s, took issue with the senior’s approach. After noting that he knew the undergraduate’s father, Bausano wrote that “he'd be ashamed of the letter you've written.”
Beginning his first response, Bausano wrote: “With all due, but clearly not deserved respect, you are an idiot.”
One accusation Bausano addressed was the undergraduate’s assertion that alumni were unduly meddling in the selection of new members, pushing legacy applicants on current undergraduates.
“You endeavor to turn our club into the type of place that only caters to the type of rich, old boys that you used to know,” the undergraduate wrote. “When you have the power to (literally) rewrite the rules in order to re-engineer the membership in your (or your son's) favor, then why shouldn't you?”
Replying, Bausano wrote that though graduates mandate legacy applicants to the club “be given the fullest consideration,” the undergraduates have the ultimate say on questions of membership. Bausano also asserted that the Owl, which currently consists heavily of athletes, should strive to recruit from a more extracurricularly diverse set.
“High concentrations of a single sport or activity within a club have historically been quite divisive and often destructive,” Bausano wrote. “A couple to several is fine, more is too much.”
The undergraduate saw the clubhouse’s temporary closure and new members-only policy as a further attempt on the part of the graduate board to alter the character of the club.
“So, why don’t we have the prestige and allure of the A.D. club or the Porcellian? ... imitating the rules governing their undergraduates will never, ever give you the results you seek,” the undergraduate wrote.
The Porcellian and A.D. clubs, which enjoy more highbrow reputations than the Owl, both have policies barring non-member events.
Tension between final clubs’ undergraduate members, who regularly benefit from the club’s multi-million dollar properties, and graduates who are ultimately responsible for the upkeep and liability of the club, is nothing new. Last academic year, the Fox Club experienced a similar rift between its graduate and undergraduate members after its undergraduates added women to their ranks without consulting the graduate board. That decision kicked off a bitter, months-long back-and-forth, ending with a summer vote that reaffirmed the club’s single-gender status yet retained “provisional” membership for the women in question.
“We love Harvard and we want to be good and constructive members of the Harvard community and that’s the driving issue for us,” Bausano said in the interview, contextualizing the graduate board’s recent re-assertion of influence.
Administrators’ new policy on clubs like the Owl, however, is designed to minimize the influence of single-gender clubs on the larger campus environment. Bausano didn’t comment specifically on the policy, saying “it sounds like the faculty and the administration are debating that issue.”
“We’ll await the result of that,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The New York road trip signals two things for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team: the approaching finals period and approaching tough competition. This weekend the team was met with the latter in the Empire State, dropping the Friday night matchup while tying on Saturday afternoon.
HARVARD 3, No. 7/7 COLGATE 3
After a string of L’s trickled down the Crimson’s (1-9-1, 1-5-1 ECAC) schedule this season, Saturday afternoon’s match up in Hamilton, N.Y. brought Harvard its first tie of the season.
The Crimson offense was silent for a majority of the game, notching zero goals over the course of the first and second period. In contrast, the Raiders (15-2-2, 6-2-1) had a steady scoring unit, adding a goal to the scoreboard once each period.
Harvard’s offense came alive in the sixth minute of the third period off the stick of freshman forward Val Turgeon. So far this season Turgeon has played in all 11 of the Crimson’s games and has amassed three goals, tied with junior forward Lexie Liang as second highest on the team behind co-captain Sydney Daniels who has five.
Junior Haley Mullins followed Turgeon’s goal less than three minutes later with help from both Daniels and Liang to tie the game at two. The contest remain tied for close to 10 minutes before Liang followed up her assist with a goal of her own, putting Harvard ahead for the first time in the entire weekend.
As the mood shifted to look in the Crimson’s favor, Colgate sophomore Jessie Eldridge drilled the puck past Harvard goalkeeper Molly Tissenbaum in the final 30 seconds of play. The notch tied the game and would go on to be the final score for either team on the night.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 0
Coming off a one point overtime loss to No. 4/3 Minnesota-Duluth last week, the Crimson felt prepared to take on an unranked team in Ithaca.
The Big Red (8-4-1, 6-2-1), however, was just as prepared, if not more, for Harvard, as its defense was able to keep the Crimson silent for the entirety of the game and hand the visitors their fourth shutout loss of the season.
The first period of action remained a scoreless back and forth battle between the two squads, as each of the opposing goaltenders was able to handle every shot their opponent gave them. The first period was when the Harvard offense was at its peak with 11 shots on goal in the first 20 minutes. After that it could only muster 10 combined shots on goal in the following two periods.
Cornell struck its first blow at the 15 minute mark of the second period when freshman Valeria Audet broke the scoring silence with help from teammates Pippy Gerace and Lenka Serdar.
Early in the third period the bleeding continued for the Crimson, as Cornell took advantage of a power play within the first two minutes of play. An insurance goal was scored late in the third period by the Big Red, with Harvard tallying its lowest shot on goal total of the night with four. Tissembaum remains winless this season.

The Harvard women’s basketball team (7-1) overcame the notion of a ‘trap game’ on Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion with a 59-38 win over visiting NJIT (3-5).
Sandwiched between Thursday’s important win against Temple and next week’s trip to face Big-12 oppponent Kansas, this game had the potential to be a letdown for the Crimson. Despite sloppy offensive play throughout, the hosts played combative defense and limited the Highlanders to 14-of-55 (25.5%) shooting.
“[The result] is huge,” head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I’ve had really, really good teams in the past that drop this game. There have been a bunch of games where we should have doubled the lead and we let them back in…. It may be because we’re young, but we have to go and find a strategy for that.”
Harvard controlled the offensive glass early, turning missed shots into points with regularity. At one point, they missed four straight three-pointers on the same possession before a fourth consecutive offensive rebound led to freshman guard Katie Benzan connecting on the fifth try. The Crimson jumped out to a 14-4 lead, with NJIT’s interior overload on defense not working.
The Highlanders responded with an 8-0 run to end the quarter fueled by a string of Harvard turnovers. Benzan and sophomore guard Madeline Raster were responsible for back-to-back-to-back miscues, and the two ended the game with 13 of Harvard’s season-high 27 turnovers.
“That’s uncharacteristic [of Raster and Benzan],” Delaney-Smith said. “I’m not sure what their mindset was. Even when we tried to make adjustments, Katie Benzan was uncharacteristically making bad decisions in situations where she’s normally stellar.”
Airtight defense, however, continued to buoy the hosts. NJIT didn’t record its first field goal of the second quarter until more than midway through the period, and Harvard used five points from sophomore Kelsey Bogdan to stretch its halftime lead to 26-16.
“We were sticking to the scout,” said Delaney-Smith of her team’s defending, “we were switching screens when we were supposed to, we were talking, we were keeping them off the board. On defense, we were far more intense than we were on the defensive end.”
Sophomore guard Nani Redford also contributed well in the latter part of the half, running the point with authority and rebounding a few misses that led to second-chance opportunities. At the half, the Crimson had attempted 21 three-pointers out of 31 total field goals and outrebounded its opponents 31 to 13. The hosts also had 14 turnovers through 20 minutes.
Turnovers continued to plague Harvard in the second half but a pair of threes from sophomore guards Sydney Skinner, who led the team with 14, and Nani Redford pushed the lead to 18. Highlanders’ sophomore Kelly Guarino’s triple followed by a layup briefly made a game of it, but Benzan responded with a three of her own to restore the Crimson’s 17-point advantage.
Skinner connected from beyond the arc on back-to-back possessions to give the hosts their biggest lead of the night, 49-25, early in the fourth quarter. This essentially ended NJIT’s hopes of a comeback, and from there on the hosts were able to see the lead safely out.
“I think getting my team back, kind of high-spirited, was the biggest thing,” Skinner said. “The and-one passes helped a lot, get the ball moving, and get our team amped again. Hitting open shots gets the crowd amped, our bench amped. I wanted to help get our energy back.”
Benzan finished the game with 11 points and a team-high seven assists, while captain Destiny Nunley scored six and grabbed 15 rebounds. Redford added nine points, six rebounds, and three assists of her own.

Harvard wrestling took its chances in Las Vegas this weekend at the 35th Annual Cliff Keen Invitational. The Crimson faced a challenge holding their own against some of the nation’s top ranked competitors.
“We were hitting a lot of close matches with highly ranked guys, but we just weren’t getting the wins,” Head Coach Jay Weiss said. “But it’s great to be in these competitions because our guys have to make decisions about how great they want to be.”
Freshman Hunter Ladnier (149 lbs.) picked up his ninth career win to start out the weekend, registering a win by decision in his opening match against Army’s Matt Kelly. The rookie was unable to keep the momentum going as the day progressed, dropping his next match against Edinboro’s Pat Lugo (No. 4) in a 4-1 decision.
“He did a really nice job,” Weiss said. “That first loss was up against the seventh ranked guy in the country,” Weiss said. “he lost to two tough guys, and he wrestled really hard.”
Harvard’s standout on the mats in Vegas was freshman AJ Jaffe, who came into the weekend with a 6-4 record at 141 lbs. Jaffe picked up two more wins during the weekend, posting the Crimson’s highest-ranking performance. Jaffe was the only Harvard wrestler to survive to the second day of competition.
“He came really close [to the podium],” Weiss said. “He listens to everything and he goes out and does it. He wrestles hard all the time and that’s hard to beat. He lost to a few guys that he was right in there with, so I’m anxious to see him over the next couple months.”
Jaffe started the weekend with a commanding victory over Minnesota’s Gannon Volk, registering his third career major decision, 11-2.  His next match was more tightly contested, as the freshman took on Cal Poly’s Colt Schilling. Jaffe held on for a 6-2 win by decision. Army’s Logan Everett (No. 4) sent Jaffe to the consolation bracket with a 10-4 decision.
Junior Kanon Dean also picked up a victory for the Crimson. He won his first bout at 184 against Columbia’s Jacob Young, 5-2, before falling by major decision in his next matchup.
“He jumped two weight classes this year, so that’s a big jump,” Weiss said.  “He’s getting used to it, and he just has to wrestle differently at 184 then he did at 167. He’s learning and doing a nice job.”
Another multiple match winner for the Crimson was junior Logan Kirby (197 lbs.). Kirby’s first opponent of the competition was eighth ranked Rocco Caywood. Caywood managed to edge Kirby 12-7, dropping the junior into the consolation bracket.  From there, Kirby notched his third win of the season, taking down Wyoming’s Cody Vigoren. In his next match he continued this trend, earning a 9-6 decision against Ivy League foe Matt Doggett.  In his final round of the weekend, Kirby lost to Air Force’s Anthony McLaughlin by fall.
The last individual winner for the Crimson was senior Jeff Ott, who recorded a win in his opening bout, pinning his opponent at 2:50. Ott then met No. 4, Anthony Tutolo who took the match, 8-3.
“On the whole, the weekend was disappointing,” Weiss said. “But there are some bright spots and we have guys who are going to keep getting better and better as competition moves on. We just didn’t get some of those matchups we were close to, but I think that in the next month and a half those will start falling our way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The saying goes that to be the best, you have to beat the best. This week, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team got the chance to prove the adage true. Competing in two meets, the Crimson faced some of the nation’s top programs and took a step towards its perpetual goal of establishing itself as a powerhouse team.
Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) split up its squad, sending its swimmers to the Texas Invitational in Austin, Texas and its divers to the Georgia Diving Invitational in Athens, Ga. Each meet featured four nationally-ranked teams. No. 5 Texas, No. 17 USC, No. 19 Stanford, and No. 24 Arizona competed at the Texas Invitational, while the Crimson squared off against No. 6 California, No. 10 Michigan, No. 13 Georgia, and No. 17 Auburn in Georgia.
Despite the high caliber of the competition, Harvard managed to hold its own, posting a number of top-10 finishes in the competitive field.
The Crimson’s efforts were led by freshman Dean Farris, who continued his impressive debut season with a third-place finish in the 200 freestyle. The Harvard rookie touched the wall less than a second behind Texas sophomore Townley Haas, who won the event. Haas competed at the 2016 Olympics and was a gold medalist in Rio in the 200 freestyle relay.
Farris’ time of 1:34.3 broke the Crimson program record in the event.
“Dean has been swimming really well so it was nice to see him go that fast this early in the season,” sophomore Brennan Novak said. “Breaking one of the oldest team records as a freshman is really impressive, so we're all excited to see how fast he will go at the end of the year.”
The freshman also contributed to another top-10 finish for Harvard in the 800 freestyle relay. Farris teamed up with fellow freshman Zach Snyder, senior Aly Abdel Khalik, and Novak to take eighth in the event.
The Crimson’s relay lineups produced strong results throughout the meet, including a 10th-place mark in the 200 freestyle relay. Farris, senior Max Yakubovich, junior Steven Tan, and sophomore Sebastian Lutz made up the Harvard A squad for the event.
Farris and Yakubovich also teamed up for the 400 medley relay, racing with juniors Koya Osada and Shane McNamara for a 12th-place result. In addition, senior Jack Manchester, sophomore Grant Goddard, and co-captains Mitchell Foster and Eric Ronda came in 15th in the 200 medley relay.
Manchester, Farris, Lutz, and Tan also swam together in the 400 freestyle relay and came up with an 11th place finish.
Farris would chip in two more solo top-15 finishes as well, coming in 13th in the 50 freestyle and 11th in the 100 backstroke. His times in both events met the NCAA ‘B’ cut standard.
Not to be outdone by their freshman teammate, Ronda and Manchester both qualified for A finals on the last day of the meet. Manchester ended up 7th in the 200 back with a ‘B’ cut time of 1:44.0. Meanwhile, Ronda secured sixth place in the top final of the 200 breast.
McNamara also finished 10th in the 100 breast, with Ronda two places behind him. Earlier in the meet, Osada and Chang had a similarly close race in the 200 IM. Osada took 14th place and Chang was less than a second off of his teammate in 15th. The result was mirrored in the 400 IM, as senior Christian Carbone outpaced Snyder by three seconds for 14th and 15th, respectively.
The Crimson finished the meet in impressive form, picking up its final top-10 finish of the weekend on the last day in the 1650 freestyle, as sophomore Logan Houck touched the wall in 10th. The Las Vegas, Nev. native took sixth place in the same event at the 2016 Olympic Trials.
Farris collected an 18th-place finish in the 100 free, and Carbone and senior Sava Turcanu ended up 14th and 18th in the 200 fly to close out the meet for Harvard.
The Crimson’s divers had an equally strong showing at the Georgia Diving Invitational. On the first day, all three Harvard athletes qualified for the final of the one-meter dive, and junior Bobby Ross took 10th place, with junior David Pfeifer and freshman Austin Fields rounding out the field for the Crimson in 14th and 15th, respectively.
The next day it would be Pfeifer’s turn to crack the top 10 in the three-meter event. The junior took seventh place, a result that qualifies him for the NCAA zone championships later this year. Ross nearly matched his mark from the previous day, taking 11th in the three-meter, while Fields ended up in 14th.
“Diving against nationally-ranked programs helps you identify more things to improve on,” Ross said. “It's easy to get stuck in the ivy league bubble where you see the same divers over and over again. When you're complacent with your diving, that's when you stop improving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team traveled to Invitationals in Texas and Georgia to take on a slew of new opponents, crushing multiple school records in the process.
The swimmers competed in the Texas Invitational, where the 400 freestyle relay team made history, setting a new school record. The squad, composed of freshmen Mikaela Dahlke and Jerrica Li, junior Gabby Sims, and senior co-captain Daniela Johnson. Their time of 3:19.37 shattered the previous record from 2011.
The quad’s performance was good for seventh in a field of new competitors, including USC, Arizona, UCLA, and Wisconsin. Harvard entered two more squads into the same event, who placed 12th and 14th respectively.
“Although we won't be competing against any of these teams at the end of our season, we wanted to approach it in the same way that we would any other meet because ultimately any racing experience will help us when we finish our season,” sophomore Brittany Usinger said.
This experience certainly set rookie Dahlke up for success, as the rookie added her own individual record to the books. The freshman placed her own Harvard record in the 100 fly B-finals, also earning an NCAA “B” cut time with a 53.67 second finish.
The California native also had the highest Crimson finish in the 100 and 200 free. In the 100 B final, she touched the wall first in 49.19 seconds—a time better than finishers in the A final, and good enough for an NCAA “B” cut time. Her 200 time of 1:48.11 was good for 16th overall.
Another strong performance in the 100 fly came from Sims, who came in 14th overall, with a time of 50.94.
Sims also participated in the 200 Medley relay, where she, along Dahlke, junior Kristina Li, and sophomore Meagan Popp took seventh with a time of 1:41.36. Harvard entered four teams total in the relay, with the B, C, and D teams coming in 10th, 13th and 18th respectively.
Usinger stepped in for Sims in the 400 Medley relay, swimming to a 12th place finish alongside Li, Popp and Dahlke. She attributes the success of the team to its cohesion and passion for the sport.
“We choose to come to practice every day and do our best, and it is not something that is forced upon us, so we are constantly inspiring each other to strive to be better and reach our fullest potential as a team,” Usinger said.
Both Usinger and Li qualified for “B” cut times in individual events as well. The sophomore led the Crimson’s butterfliers in the 100 fly C-finals, finishing 17th with a time of 53.80. Li made waves in the 100 back, earning 14th in 54.29 seconds.
Although narrowly missing “B” cuts, Popp shone in her individual events as well. The sophomore took 14th in the 200 IM, touching the wall in 2:01.63. She also won the C final of the 100 breast, with Harvard’s highest placing time of 1:02.86, earning her the 17th place slot.
Meanwhile, junior Reagan Kology held down the long-distance contingent, earning Harvard’s highest finish in the 1650 free, placing 14th, directly ahead of teammate senior Willa Wang. The two again faced off in the 500 free, this time with Wang finishing in 21st, two spots ahead of Kology.
“We choose to lead from within and everyone is always there to support each other,” Usinger said. “Together we endure the challenges that come with the sport, and this has allowed us to become very close.”
New heights were also being reached in Athens, Georgia, where the Crimson divers competed in the 1 meter, 3 meter, and platform competitions.
“It can be really tough keeping our energy up for invitationals since they are two to three days long, but it is helpful to look at each day as a fresh start,” sophomore Mikaela Thompson said. “We have such a supportive team and cheer each other on so much that if you’re a little low in energy one of your teammates is there to pick you up.”
Junior Jing Leung—the team’s only competitor in the platform competition—took home fourth place with a score of 236.75. Leung, an NCAA first team all American, placed highest of any Harvard diver in any event, only falling behind two divers from UCLA and one from Michigan.
The junior found success on the springboards as well, placing ninth in the 3 meter finals, ahead of fellow junior Hannah Allchurch.
The meet proved tumultuous for Thompson, who saw her scores slip from 299.80 in the prelims—good for a bronze—to 257.90 in the 3 meter finals. Thompson ultimately finished 13th in the event. Again, the sophomore went into the 1 meter finals having taken third in the preliminaries, only to end the day with 11th overall. Even so, her performances proved top-notch among her teammates.
“Knowing that your team is behind you 100% regardless of whether you put in your best dives or fall a little short of what you might have hoped is really important when you’re competing for a team,” Thompson said.
