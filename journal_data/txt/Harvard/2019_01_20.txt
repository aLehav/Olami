After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square diners disappointed by the recent slew of restaurant closings finally have a new place to dig in — the Longfellow Bar at Alden & Harlow opened its doors on Brattle Street Saturday.
The restaurant, located in the former Algiers Cafe space in Brattle Hall at 40 Brattle St., is restaurateur Michael Scelfo’s most recent pursuit in Harvard Square. The new bar and eatery sits atop his five-year-old flagship restaurant Alden & Harlow. Scelfo also owns Waypoint, located on Massachusetts Avenue.
Scelfo said his new restaurant will continue his classic style of serving “passing and sharing” dishes, a concept he first introduced at Alden & Harlow.
“Passing and sharing plates is very comfortable to people when you think about how you eat at home or dining with guests,” Scelfo said. “Alden & Harlow has been open for five years now, and we’ve always hung our hats on shareable, small plates.”
Scelfo said he hopes to enhance that comfortable environment at his new restaurant.
“[The Longfellow Bar] is taking that idea and evolving it even further to encourage people to eat with their hands and enjoy cocktails and be super casual,” he said.
He said he also sees the restaurant as a space for friends to congregate and hopes it carries on Brattle Hall’s traditional purpose as a meeting place when it was built more than a century ago.
Scelfo said he also wants to embrace and reflect Cambridge's cultural diversity with his food offerings. The menu will include Ethiopian and Middle Eastern-style dishes, along with American food with “an Asian flare to it,” according to Scelfo.
“We’ve picked all cultures’ finger food and items that are traditionally eaten with your hands to feature on the menu,” he said.
Ultimately, Scelfo said he thinks the Longfellow Bar will be a “representation of what Harvard Square is and always has been, which is a celebration of culture.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of protestors donning bright pink hats and scarves braved sub-freezing temperatures to converge on Boston Commons Saturday for the Boston Women’s March – turning out alongside hundreds of other “sister” marches across the country.
March Forward Massachusetts, a progressive nonprofit organization that mobilized the original Boston Women’s March in January 2017, coordinated this year’s event. Congresswoman Ayanna S. Pressley, who recently became the first African-American woman to represent Massachusetts, served as honorary chair of the march’s steering committee and delivered the keynote speech at the event.
Espousing the slogan “Until All Voices are Heard”, the 2019 Boston Women’s March centered on inclusivity of a broad range of identities and perspectives. Organizers declared a commitment to “an intersectional feminist framework,” and pledged to support “human rights, civil rights, religious freedom, racial justice, economic justice, reproductive justice, climate justice, and workers’ rights to form a union” in a statement on the event’s website.
Speakers included leaders from Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s Boston branch, the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Impact, and other groups.
Attendees raised colorful signs reading “Defend Roe v. Wade,” “A Woman’s Place is in the House and the Senate,” and “#TimesUp,” among other messages that criticized climate change, the government shutdown, and a border wall.
A group of counter-protesters including nationalists were also present at the march and carried signs reading “Build the Wall,” “Pro-Life,” and “Resist Marxism.” They were cordoned off from the crowd by a police presence.
Mahtowin Munro from the United American Indians of New England gave the opening speech, in which she denounced the current administration’s treatment of incoming refugees at the Southern border.
“Today, I want to express solidarity with our refugee relatives from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries, because they, too, are indigenous,” Munro said. “Right now, these refugees are bearing the brunt of colonial border violence.”
Speakers throughout the event referenced progressive legislative and electoral victories from the November 2018 election.
Alexandra Chandler, whose 2018 campaign marked her the first openly transgender candidate in Massachusetts to run for Congress, touted the recent passage of Massachusetts ballot Question 3, which preserved transgender rights in the state.
“We won because it wasn’t just trans people showing up for trans people,” she said. “It was non-trans people of color, the immigrant community, and women of every identity who talked to their friends and knocked on doors for us — because we are all in this together.”
Pressley, in the keynote speech, said collective activism was responsible for tangible progress, as manifested in the election of record-breaking numbers of women to Congress in 2018.
“While our names might appear on the ballot, behind those names are whole tribes, communities, villages, coalitions, movements of women and allies who embody, who actualize a bold mandate for change and we are just getting started!” she said.
This year’s Boston Women’s March proceeded amidst controversy following some National Women’s March leaders’ refusal to condemn anti-Semitic remarks. The Boston Women’s March, however, is run independently and is not associated with the national movement.
Cindy A. Rowe ’86, executive director of the Jewish Alliance for Law and Social Action, said the leaders of March Forward Massachusetts reached out to her to join the march’s steering committee in an effort to ensure the event was inclusive of all identities – including the Jewish community.
“It was very important for the Boston March organizers to make sure that people understood that our march was going to be totally inclusive and that we’re going to stand in opposition to anti-Semitism,” said Rowe, who also spoke at the event.
Though some students are still away from campus on winter break, others were able to attend the event. Members of the Harvard Kennedy School student group Women in Power Professional Interest Council organized a group of graduate students to attend the march.
Attendee Michaela R. Gaziano, a Kennedy School student, said she was attracted to the event because of its potential to bring people together.
“Women kind of just come from all over the city and all over the state and all that day everyone knows each other,” she said. “For those who go, it’s a very powerful movement – and why not do it with people who you go to school with?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the course of a season, members of a Division I men’s basketball program expect to come in contact with imposing seven-foot bigs, feisty guards, uncompromising officials and coaches who may be even more relentless. Memories — good and bad — are formed under the bright lights of old gyms and drenched undershirts.
But take a quick scroll through Harvard Basketball’s social media or website, and it isn’t long before you find the team decked out not in their crimson jerseys or black warmups, but in suit and tie attire.
Any astute outsider trying to understand the Harvard Basketball brand would recognize a familiar pattern when scrolling through the plethora of team meet-ups of influential leaders from this past semester alone.
Whether it was ex-Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to civil rights advocate Colin Kaepernick or most recently, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, a critical component of the student-athlete experience under the decade-plus leadership of coach Tommy Amaker is grounded upon exposure to important social advocacy issues ranging from education to racial justice.
Take the November midterm elections, for example. Alongside strategizing upcoming matchups and running through opponent scouting reports, the locker room also served as a springboard for political discussions and sharing opinions of important current events.
“I asked them, ‘So how many of you guys were able to vote?’ A majority of them raised their hands so it was great and I was really pleased to see that,” Amaker said. “We are always engaged with what’s going on around us and had discussions about politics or anything that comes up. I like to just listen sometimes and I get engaged sometimes. They ask some questions for me.”
These conversations extend beyond Lavietes Pavilion and carry across not just the Charles River — where numerous members of the team have pursued classes academically connected to social inequality or the role of NGOs in activism movements — but on road trips as well, where an active effort is taken to provide valuable opportunities for education outside of the classroom.
Over winter break, the team walked through the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr. in his childhood home of Atlanta, visiting Ebenezer Baptist Church before paying tribute to King at his memorial. The team also dined at Paschal’s, a landmark meeting spot for civil rights strategists including King himself.
"Today was as meaningful as any day in my 12 years here at Harvard," said Amaker in a team statement. "To visit and worship at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church - home of Dr. Martin Luther King - and to meet and visit with former President & First Lady Carter was truly an honor and a privilege. It was the experience of a lifetime for our kids."
“This is a lifetime experience, something I don’t think anyone on our team will ever forget,” junior Christian Juzang added. “We’re so grateful for that, for those opportunities. It goes back to the power of Harvard...and to have Jimmy Carter come, it's mind blowing, and we're so appreciative to have those opportunities.”
Accompanying the team as a de facto tour guide was a close mentor for the program, the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals and Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church, Reverend Jonathan Walton. A native of Atlanta and a college classmate of Rev. Raphael Warnock — the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Walton was tasked specifically by Amaker to organize this excursion for the team and noted how this trip conjoined well with the team’s visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on Sunday. The Crimson will visit Howard University on Monday in its final non-conference game of the season.
“I wanted these young men to see that not only is this living history — as they are still a part of the struggle that is ongoing for human rights for all — but it’s not something that any of us have to wait on you to participate in and get engaged,” Walton said. “If we say this is somebody else’s responsibility, ... you may be missing your moment. All of us have that same opportunity if we take advantage of what Dr. King called the urgency of now.”
One former Crimson captain who has embraced this message of speaking out is Chris Egi ‘18, who delivered a speech during Commencement on searching for his black identity at Harvard while reconciling with the continued occurrences of racism and violence across America.
“And I guess that’s why I’d felt compelled to joined the protesters that day — even if I hadn’t ever considered myself an activist,” Egi described in a follow-up piece for The Players’ Tribune, in which he reflected on spontaneously joining a Harvard Square protest on institutional violence. “It was because Ferguson happened the same month I started college — the same time Michael Brown would’ve started college. And because I was 18 years old, the same age as Michael Brown.”
Egi is just one example of a Crimson student-athlete embracing a more outspoken position on issues of equality and justice in the country. During last year’s national discussions on athlete activism, members of the team including current captain Corey Johnson spoke on the importance of unity and example-setting in the face of political discord.
“It is obviously a big statement and brings a lot of attention to the basketball community and around the country,” said Johnson in referencing Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s “shut up and dribble” comments, “But we are a family here and support everybody no matter what their beliefs are and that’s what we reiterate and that’s what we want to come off as a team. It’s tough to see what’s going on in the country but we just have to stick to us and continue to be positive role models here and to the rest of the world.”
For Rev. Walton — who is co-teaching a class with Professor Brandon Terry on “the political and religious philosophy of Martin Luther King Jr.,” this upcoming semester entitled “Conscientious Citizenship” — those on the team have a distinct responsibility on campus beyond simply winning championships.
“These boys are called to be leaders on and off the court, and people look up to them literally and metaphorically,” Walton noted. “It is because of this that they have a responsibility to use their platform, prominence, and privileged position in the world to call attention to the plight and suffering of others.”
And in speaking of the team’s audience at Lavietes Pavilion and beyond, coach Amaker pointed out that the team’s popularity is itself a representation of the strides made in diversity on campus — as noted by former President and longtime basketball supporter Drew Faust.
“I've love how she talks about how diverse our community has become around our basketball games,” Amaker said. “You can just look and see diversity and you know, not only in terms of race, but also with students, deans, faculty, professors, it's just a whole host of people. So pretty neat to see how it's touched a lot of people in our community.”
As this program has demonstrated, basketball can serve as a important bridge in connecting those from different backgrounds and a spotlight for bringing to the forefront important societal issues. Beyond the wins and losses, coach Amaker’s tenure at Harvard will be defined by the standards he has established off-the-court, in those oversized suit-and-ties.
“Tommy knows everybody and rather than build relationships to strengthen his own prominence or reputation, he uses his relationships to encourage the work of others, to put up in front of his young men as an example of what is possible for them,” Rev. Walton said. “Life is not just about earning a living, but living a life that is worth living.”
