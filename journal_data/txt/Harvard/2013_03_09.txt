After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine waking up on a Sunday morning with the following notice on your door: “We must nurse our children and grandchildren on hatred for Zionists and for Jews... These bloodsuckers who attack the Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.”  This would be disturbing, out-of-context, and highly inflammatory.
The hypothetical posting of Egyptian President Morsi’s recent hateful statements on students’ doors across campus, like the “eviction notices” distributed by the Palestine Solidarity Committee last weekend, violate the tradition of open and intellectual discourse valued at Harvard. Evictions and demolitions are important issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict, as are anti-Semitism and incitement throughout the Arab world. However, presented without a balanced explanation, these issues are reduced to polarizing discourse that are counterproductive to reaching a mutual understanding. This was exhibited in the PSC’s launch of their so-called “Israeli Apartheid Week”— a dishonest and imbalanced method of engagement.
As two seniors writing theses on aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict, we have actively sought out views that oppose our own and continue to work in an effort to understand contradicting narratives. Through our research and combined eight months of living experience in Israel over the past year, we found barriers to peace attributable to both Israel and the Palestinians. We realize the importance of employing a framework that engages with multiples perspectives. There are limits to this framework, however, when words are based in hatred rather than facts. The Palestinian Solidarity Committee has reached this limit in its portrayals of the conflict as one-sided, revealing either a lack of understanding of history or rejection of an honest, albeit challenging, conversation about the complicated reality.
The PSC’s use of the word “apartheid” is ahistorical, polarizing, and preventative of informed, fact-based dialogue. The implication of the comparison to “apartheid” is that the Israelis are racist totalitarians ruling over blameless Palestinians, with no consideration for the nuances and details of the conflict. Israel’s Declaration of Independence guarantees equal rights to all citizens irrespective of religion, race, or sex. It is a country where a Palestinian citizen of Israel serves as a Supreme Court Justice; where political discourse includes Arab elected officials who are hyper-critical of Israel; and where all citizens are guaranteed the same right to education. It is a country committed to peaceful coexistence, not a country with a systematic policy of racism. By using the misnomer of “apartheid,” the PSC explicitly demonizes Israel by squeezing the complicated Arab-Israeli conflict into the same racially driven mold that existed in South Africa. We take issue with certain Israeli policies and recognize that the state is not perfect, but we base our criticism in historically accurate facts. It takes only a very rudimentary understanding of the situation to appreciate the PSC’s gross misuse of the word “apartheid.”
The PSC as an organization consistently projects a dishonest voice that distorts the reality of the conflict. Last November, the group staged a “die-in” to show solidarity with the Palestinian people of Gaza under what the PSC deemed a so-called “unprovoked assault” from Israel. It is one thing to show solidarity with the people of Gaza, but labeling the operation as “unprovoked” is a deliberate neglect for the more than 10,000 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel over the previous decade. The PSC bases its activism in the Veritas Handbook, a 347-page “guide to understanding the struggle for Palestinian human rights.” Crimson columnist Daniel Solomon described it last week as “glib dismissals of Arab and Muslim anti-Semitism...indulg[ing] in conspiracy theories, that Mossad agents, not government-sanctioned campaigns of violence and terror, were responsible for the exodus of Jews from Arab lands.” The PSC’s mission statement states that it “does not prescribe a solution to the struggle; rather...believe[s] in supporting and amplifying the voices of those working against injustice.” If an organization is devoted to a struggle, that struggle should at least aim for a peaceful resolution built on mutual respect and understanding. Instead, the PSC polarizes the campus discourse through misinformation and inflammatory tactics.
We acknowledge the PSC’s efforts to bring attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict at Harvard. The PSC’s engagement, however, is a struggle based on publicity stunts and inaccurate buzz words— just as posting Morsi’s hateful statement with no explanation would have been—leaving no space for open discussion or reasoned debate. We call on the organization to delve into the intricacies of the reality of the Arab-Israeli conflict and to take on opposing narratives, especially when they challenge pre-existing understandings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators secretly accessed the email accounts of 16 resident deans in an attempt to determine who leaked communication regarding the Government 1310 cheating scandal that made its way to the media, the Boston Globe reported on Saturday evening.
The searches, reported on the basis of interviews with “several Harvard officials,” were for the origin of the leak of an internal email sent on Aug. 16 by Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, the Globe reported. That internal email, in which Ellison advised his colleagues about how to counsel athletes and other students implicated in the scandal, had been forwarded by a resident dean to one of his students. The contents of that email were reported in The Crimson on Sept. 1, two days after the scandal broke.
Administrators informed the resident dean who had forwarded Ellison’s email of the search shortly after it occurred, but did not tell the other resident deans until after being approached by the Globe on Thursday. The resident dean in question, like all resident deans, sits on the Ad Board, the disciplinary body that handled the cases of alleged cheating.
The Globe article noted that administrators searched one of two Harvard email accounts belonging to resident deans—the account for administrative matters, rather than for personal ones. Also, Harvard information technology employees were told to look only for certain email subject lines and not to read the contents of messages themselves, the Globe reported.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy allows administrators to access faculty email accounts in “extraordinary circumstances such as legal proceedings and internal Harvard investigations,” according to a document on Harvard’s Information Security and Privacy website. In such cases, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Office of the General Counsel must approve such a review, and the faculty member must be notified.
Resident deans, though, are not technically faculty. They are listed as “House Staff” on the Office of Student Life’s website and hold an administrative appointment which comes with some faculty privileges, but it is unclear what rules guide administrative access to their email accounts.
In a statement, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith did not rule out searching email accounts. He said that Harvard would take “all necessary and appropriate actions under our procedures to safeguard the integrity” of the Ad Board process if given reason to believe that the process had been “compromised.” He added that he would agree to take steps that struck a “balance between our needs to respect the privacy of our employees and to protect the privacy of our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of its late season surge, the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-19-3, 6-14-2 ECAC) has mainly relied on its senior class, a talented group of veterans looking to salvage its last season with the Crimson after a slow start.
But on Friday night in the opening game of the ECAC playoffs at Thompson Arena, the rookies stole the show, netting two goals and propelling Harvard to a 2-1 upset victory over Dartmouth to gain a 1-0 lead in the best-of-three series in the first-round of the ECAC conference tournament.
“Obviously it’s playoff hockey and we are excited every game, but we had a fire going into Friday,” junior defenseman John Caldwell said. “We had something to prove; we haven’t had the greatest season in the world so we are a little frustrated, and we wanted to prove something.”
The Crimson jumped in front with the first goal of the game in the second period from freshman defenseman Desmond Bergin, but the Big Green (15-12-5, 9-9-4 ECAC) came back midway through the third to knot the score at one.
The score stayed that way until just under three minutes remained in the contest.
After a series of passes from freshman Kyle Criscuolo and senior Marshall Everson, freshman Brian Hart fired a shot at the Dartmouth net. Initially blocked by Big Green goalie Cab Morris, Hart followed up on his shot, collected his own rebound and found the back of the net.
“The freshmen have actually been great this year, they came in and assumed a pretty big role on the team early on and have helped us all season,” Caldwell said. “Normally there is a learning curve for a lot of the freshmen as they come in and get adjusted to the speed of the game…but our guys have been really good even from the beginning to get out there and get the knack of it really quickly and really contribute to the team…so it’s no surprise that they scored on Friday.”
The Crimson was able to withstand Dartmouth’s final empty-net push, with junior netminder Raphael Girard coming up with several of his 39 saves on the night in front of the Harvard net.
The Crimson is 4-0 when capturing the first game of the first-round series, last winning in 2011 when it upset Clarkson in a similar late-season run. But in that same season the Big Green was able to come back after falling in the first game of the quarterfinal series against Harvard.
Friday night’s game marks Bergin’s first appearance since injuring his ankle back on Jan. 12 against Dartmouth in Thompson Arena. He made his presence felt immediately with his second period goal, his second of the season.
“Desmond is a talented defenseman; he’s good offensively and defensively,” Girard said. “Also it brings a man back to the roster which is pretty short on numbers, it allows us to play John Caldwell on forward who is a physical presence out there so it gives us more depth overall everywhere.”
Freshman forward Greg Gozzo passed the puck back up along the right boards to junior defenseman Danny Fick, who then sent a pass along the blue line to Bergin waiting at the left point. Bergin collected the puck and fired a slapshot through traffic and into the net.
Dartmouth responded with a goal from Jesse Beamish, who netted the game-winner against the Crimson in the January contest. Tim O’Brien and Charlie Mosey were attributed with assists on the play.
Hart’s game-winner at 17:15 in the third was his fifth of the season and 18th point of the year, now tied with Ivy League Rookie of the Year Jimmy Vesey for second on the team in points, one behind assistant captain Alex Fallstrom.
The goal came on a counter attack, with the Big Green rush initially broken up by Everson. Criscuolo found the puck, made a short pass back to Everson, who then bounced the puck off the left boards to Hart near the blue line. Hart skated up along the left side, fired a wrist shot at Morris and then capitalized on his second chance on the rebound.
“We are excited about the win,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But we realize that this is one [and] you need two and they are a very good hockey team so we expect the intensity that was in the third period to be there all three periods [Saturday] night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scene was set for a decisive fourth frame on Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium. After trading blows for three quarters, the Harvard men's lacrosse team entered the game’s final 15 minutes clinging to a 7-6 lead over Georgetown. And as it had done all game long, the Crimson defense held strong. Ten minutes passed with no scoring from either side, until junior attackman Peter Schwartz fired a shot from straight-on to give his team a two-goal cushion. The Hoyas (2-2) had no answer in the waning minutes and Harvard (2-2) walked off with the 8-6 victory.
The Crimson got big performances from Shwartz, who tallied two goals, as well as junior midfielder Daniel Eipp, who added one goal to go along with three assists. But perhaps the strongest play on the afternoon came from senior goalkeeper Harry Krieger, who anchored a stifling defensive performance for Harvard with twice as many saves (12) as goals allowed (6).
“The defense has been strong this year but it was exceptional today,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “Georgetown is an excellent team and our D was on…as was as our goaltender.”
After scoring three unanswered goals in the second frame, Harvard found itself on the opposite end of the equation to begin the third quarter. A trio of Georgetown scores allowed the Hoyas to slice into the Crimson lead and eventually claim the advantage.
The first of those goals came unassisted from Georgetown sophomore midfielder Charles McCormick at the 12:30 mark. Two minutes later, the Hoyas parlayed a save from goalkeeper Jake Haley into a break on the other end, with Riley O’Connor eventually finding himself alone in front of the net, where he beat Krieger to tie the game at four.
The Georgetown momentum continued as senior attackman Zac Guy took the lead for his squad just a minute later on a top-shelf shot from the left flank.
But that momentum soon turned. Eipp found midfielder Ryan Stevens in front of the net, and the senior maneuvered through traffic and finished to bring Harvard level with 7:30 to play in the third frame. Eipp continued to make plays for the Crimson, scoring a goal of his own a minute later to give Harvard a one-goal advantage.
“We had great efforts on both offense and defense today,” Eipp said. “It was a complete team effort.”
Eipp earned his third assist of the game soon after, as he found freshman attackman Devin Dwyer streaking to the goal. Dwyer’s score gave the Crimson a two-goal lead with two minutes to play in the quarter, but that lead was cut to one just moments later by sophomore attackman Riley O’Connor, setting the stage for the deciding final frame.
“I was really happy that our guys came to play and really wanted this game,” Wojcik said.
The first half was a defensive battle, with the two sides combining for just six goals. The game opened with high energy but little scoring, despite the fact that each side had its early chances. It wasn’t until the six-minute mark that Hoyas senior attackman Brian Casey broke the stalemate with a man-up, unassisted goal—his eighth of the young season.
But Harvard broke through soon after. Freshman attackman Sean McDonagh, beginning from the top of the box, streaked by his defender from left to right and fired a shot that found its way under the stick of Georgetown sophomore goalkeeper Jake Haley.
The 1-1 tie would be short-lived, however. The Hoyas won the ensuing faceoff and Casey, finding himself behind the Crimson net, wrapped around and fired a shot past Krieger. Both defenses held strong for the remainder of the quarter.
The second frame was all Harvard. One play after firing a shot over the Georgetown net, junior attackman Peter Schwartz took a pass from freshman attackman Devin Dwyer and bounced a shot into the back of the net, knotting the score at two with just under 13 minutes to play in the frame.
The home squad tacked on another seconds later. Following a Georgetown turnover on the ensuing faceoff, the Crimson carried the ball through the midfield before senior midfielder Alex White found junior attackman Carl Zimmerman, who finished from close range to give Harvard its first lead of the afternoon.
The two teams traded shots for the next few minutes, with neither breaking through until the waning seconds of the period, when Eipp faked out his defender at the top of the box, drew the defense towards him, and found captain Jason Gonos, who beat the goalkeeper from close range to send the Crimson into the half leading, 4-2.
Harvard may have benefited from a little additional home-field advantage in the form of sub-40 degree temperatures throughout the game.
“We were out here playing in the hail a few days ago,” Eipp said. “It definitely gives us some additional toughness on days like today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a regular season of breakouts and busts, comebacks and collapses, and departure and development, the Harvard men’s basketball team has finished on top.
With a 65-56 win over Cornell Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion, the Crimson clinched its third consecutive Ivy title, and with some help from Brown—which beat Princeton, 80-67—Harvard is headed to the NCAA Tournament for the second straight season.
The Crimson (19-9, 11-3 Ivy) entered the night needing a win to clinch a share of the championship, and a Tigers loss in one of its two final games—Saturday at Brown or Tuesday at Penn—to win the title outright.
It got the help it needed on Saturday, when the Bears stunningly upset Princeton in Providence.
“Just how we drew it up,” co-captain Christian Webster joked. “I’m just thankful. This is crazy.”
Of course, before Harvard could worry about the rest of the league, it had to take care of business on its home court against the Big Red (13-18, 5-9).
And following a season of dramatic finishes, it was only fitting that the final contest came down to the wire.
After trailing by 14 with nine minutes to go in the second half, Cornell cut the Harvard lead to five with 1:35 remaining. But Miles Asajo-Adjei missed a jumper that would have made it a one-possession game, and sophomore Wesley Saunders, junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, and freshman Siyani Chambers knocked down six of eight free throws in the final moments to ice the championship and begin the celebration as the student section stormed the court.
“What a victory of our kids, and what a weekend for our program,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I can’t say enough how proud I am of our guys.”
The Crimson’s third championship was its most unexpected. After a season began with the departures of co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the Crimson withstood its toughest non-conference schedule yet and maintained a lead through league play until last weekend, when a sweep by Princeton and Penn put Harvard a game back of the Tigers.
“We were obviously very dejected and down after that two-loss weekend,” Amaker said. “[But] we said that we have it play this out and see how it shakes out.”
It played out well for the Crimson, which took care of business at home this weekend, while the Tigers were shockingly swept to send the Crimson to the dance.
“We never gave up, and anything can happen in this league,” Rivard said.
On Saturday, Harvard went into the half up eight and stretched its lead to 13 when Chambers hit a long three from the top of the key. Errick Peck answered back with a layup for a Cornell, but Rivard—who led all scorers with 17 points—answered back with a left-wing long ball to push the advantage to 14.
From there, Cornell began chipping away and got within seven with 4:28 remaining on an Asafo-Adjai layup and then within five on two Peck free throws.
But Harvard, after nearly blowing a 21-point second-half lead in Ithaca on Feb. 8, was able to hang on Saturday night for its third straight title.
“For me it’s definitely the sweetest one out of the three,” said Webster, the winningest player in Harvard history. “I couldn’t ask for anything more.”
The Crimson came out of the gate hot and opened up a 19-13 advantage midway through the first half after a longball by Rivard, who tied the program record for three-pointers in a season during the contest.
But Cornell—which stalled at the top of the key to run the play clock down on many of its first-half possessions—fought back to tie the game with a 6-0 run.
“I thought that in all honesty given the personnel problems that they have suffered recently that it was a terrific strategy,” Amaker said. “[Cornell coach Bill Courtney] was trying to shorten the game.”
After an Asafo-Adjai layup tied the game at 23, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi knocked down two free throws, Saunders found the forward underneath for a reverse layup, and Rivard drilled a three from the right wing to put Harvard up seven.
Peck—the focus of a Big Red offense that was missing its best player, sophomore Shonn Miller, as well as starters Johnathan Gray and Devin Cherry—was fouled on a drive with 5.6 seconds remaining before the break. He went to the line and hit his first free throw, but missed the second, and Chambers went coast-to-coast against the Cornell defense for a layup at the buzzer to extend Harvard’s lead to eight.
“I think we ended the half well,” Amaker said. “That was a critical stretch of the game for us.”
After pulling away in the second, Harvard became the ninth team since the Ivy League’s inception in 1946 to win three straight league titles.
“We may not have had what we what we had [at the beginning of the season], but we believed that we had enough, and we stayed with that theme,” Amaker said. “To be here right now—what a moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard men’s basketball game was long over, a sizable crowd lingered at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday night, huddled around various computer screens, eagerly awaiting updates on made and missed free throws taken 60 miles away. The Crimson had just closed out a victory over Cornell, 65-56, and with that, captured a share of the Ivy crown.
But a bigger story was in the works in Providence, R.I. Princeton—the lone team that held complete control over its Ancient Eight championship chances at the start of the weekend—was trailing a Brown team with a sub-.500 conference record and just a few minutes left to play.
Despite getting within five with as few as 40 seconds remaining after two free throws from guard TJ Bray, the Tigers were unable to close the gap any further, eventually falling to the Bears, 80-67.
And with that, less than an hour after securing at least a share of its third straight Ivy title, the Crimson became the second squad in the country to punch a ticket to the 2013 NCAA Tournament.
“I just feel like the basketball gods have been on our sides the entire way,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “To know that we had two home games down the stretch and Princeton had three road games, as Coach said, we would have killed to get in this position, so we are so grateful.”
After an audible yell from the hallway, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker reentered the conference room on the second floor, beaming as he addressed his co-captains and then the press for the second time that evening.
“We’re thrilled about the fact that we are Ivy League champions outright,” Amaker said. “This obviously is a tough league, as anyone who has been a part of it will tell you. As challenging as this 14-game tournament really is, we talk about how challenging it is to win on the road.”
Amaker’s squad will play on college basketball’s biggest stage for the second time in as many years and the third time in program history. Last season, Harvard fell to Vanderbilt, 79-70, in the second round of tournament play at The Pit in Albuquerque, N.M. Two years ago, the Crimson narrowly missed out on NCAA Tournament play, as then-junior Doug Davis beat the buzzer with a jumper to push Princeton past the Crimson in a one-game playoff for the automatic bid.
After co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew from school before the start of the 2012-13 campaign, the preseason media poll tabbed Princeton as the favorite to claim this year’s Ivy title. But Harvard, despite dropping two games last weekend, was able to successfully defend its second championship in school history.
“We always talk about standards, and that is what we live by, not focusing on what other people say about us,” Webster said. “That’s something that we have done all season.... We lost those great guys and those great players but we came here for a reason and that’s to win Ivy League championships.”
Heading into the final weekend of Ancient Eight play, the Crimson sat half a game behind Princeton after suffering two consecutive road losses at the hands of the Tigers and Penn, respectively, to fall out of first place in the conference standings.
“We lost to a [Penn] team [and] we feel we could have won that game if we had played better," Rivard said. "We worked hard all [this] week like we worked hard all season and we had to take care of our business.”
With two games left to play, Harvard needed to sweep Cornell and Columbia this weekend and hope that the Tigers lost at least one game of their remaining three. Two Harvard wins paired with a single Princeton loss would have set the stage for a playoff to determine which team would claim the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the Big Dance.
But Yale and Brown did one better, as Princeton lost both of its games this weekend, handing the Crimson the outright title and opportunity to dance. After closing out the regular season with two wins at home, the Crimson awaits news of its next opponent on Selection Sunday.
“It’s an incredible testament to these two young men who were able to make this happen for our program,” Amaker said of Rivard and Webster. “We are thrilled to be playing in the NCAA Tournament.”

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
If Houses had relationship statuses, Leverett would be the friend-zone. Between housing and the Masters, there's a lot to really really like, and yet Lev is still in search of love. All the descriptions below come with the huge caveat that Old Lev (McKinlock Hall) will be renovated next school year, improving housing, facilities, and the dining hall significantly. Perhaps puberty will succeed in catapulting this perpetually unobjectionable House into the hearts of millions. Or hundreds, at least. 
House Spirit: As a freshman, you probably didn't know that much about Lev. Residents, whether they were current sophomores or seniors, all reiterated stories of not really knowing what to think when they were assigned Lev on Housing Day. One reason for the lackluster spirit may well be Leverett's size—it's the largest House (with over 100 students more than Kirkland), and it shows. Leverettites do, however, praise their HoCo for becoming more inclusive and responsive in recent semesters.
Housing Quality: Leverett currently has a good variety of housing options, split between the modern F and G Towers and McKinlock, which offers the classic Harvard residential experience. Because sophomores participate in the housing lotteries, they get to know Leverett well early on as they pore over floor plans and scout out potential suites. Suites in McKinlock are roomy, though the age of the building is audible in its noisy radiators and creaky floors. In the Towers, sophomores are generally put into quints with a massive common room and a mix of singles and doubles. Juniors and seniors typically live higher up in the Towers, trading in the common rooms for larger singles and better views.
Dining Hall: Humanities and social science concentrators—the essay writers—are inclined to describe their dining hall as pretty good, if crowded at times. However, science and math concentrators—the p-setters among us—uniformly rave about the dining hall as a place for late night (and painfully early morning) camaraderie. This is especially true on Wednesday nights, when the dining hall is stuffed to the gills with students there for a) Physics night and b) the piles of baked goods that "Chief" (see below for explanation) makes sure to replenish often.
The food itself receives average ratings, but Leverettites do have some special perks. For community dinners, Chef Chad Campo whips up a special treat each Thursday night—this week, bananas brulée; last week, homemade potato chips. The absence of lox at Sunday brunches is offset by the presence of a special omelette bar. Tea, soda, and cereal is always accessible in the dining hall. And residents rushing back from a long day will be happy to know that there is warm food to be found in the servery far longer than you'd expect.
Facilities: The facilities are Leverett's weakest point. The JCR is a stately-looking meeting place; the Old Library is a popular place for rehearsals and productions; the actual library, housed between the Towers and McKinlock, is small but serviceable. But the common rooms in the Towers are underutilized, and we noticed a stack of sofas in F Tower that have seemingly never been used.  In general, the lack of common space is a pressing issue for Lev and undoubtedly contributes to the lackluster House spirit. We're looking forward to seeing this remedied with the renewal of Old Lev next year, which will bring with it renovated studios and rec rooms.
House Masters: Howard Georgi '68 and Ann Georgi—far better known as "Chief" and "Coach," respectively—are the greatest rallying points for Leverett House. Chief, with his "photographic" memory, prides himself on getting to know nearly everyone in his House. One sophomore joked, "I was disappointed that Chief didn't know my name at the Housing Day welcome dinner," mere hours after she was lotteried into the House. "But the next time I saw him, a few days later, he had it down." The Masters' Open Houses are famed events on campus, an occasion to mingle with fellow Leverettites as well as every other monkeybread fanatic on campus. Students also cite events such as Chief's weekly "Not Just Sherry Hour" and the pre-exams "Donut Bash" in describing the Georgis as "the model Masters."
Extra: Leverett's web presence is great, between its attractive website and Chief's Flickr account, where he has posted over ten thousand photos highlighting House life. Finally, Leverettites describe their House's location as ideal: McKinlock is on the River, they're bordering most of the River Houses, and they are close enough to make use of the Mather Express on particularly foul days. Keep in mind, though, that most Leverettites must walk outside to get to their dining hall... undoubtedly a first world problem, but hey, we know these things matter to you.
Our rankings so far:
10. Leverett
11. Dunster
12. Currier
Disclaimer: Flyby's 2013 House Rankings, though unscientific, are based on careful research and review by the Flyby Staff. We encourage you to read the full posts—rather than the rankings alone—to learn more about each House. As difficult as it makes our jobs, thereis good to be found in every one of the twelve.
CORRECTION: March 9, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the class year of Leverett House Master Howard Georgi '68. In fact, while Georgi graduated from Harvard in 1967, he is a member of the Class of 1968.

Every day between now and Housing Day, Flyby will release two new House rankings. The top two Houses will be revealed on Wednesday, March 13. Check back daily for updates!
Mather residents will be the first to tell you that the best thing about living in Mather is that you don't have to look at it. Inside the Brutal exterior, Matherites enjoy some of the nicest spaces on the river: singles all three years, a cozy dining hall with a river view, and spacious common spaces, among other top-notch amenities. Once you're in Mather, most say, you won't want to leave. The trouble is getting there in the first place. For all of the House's benefits, location is not one of them. 
House Spirit: Mather residents say their House lacks the spirit it was once famous for. With a HoCo that is a bit insular and relatively few House events, residents say their love House spirit comes more from their group of friends than the community as a whole. Still, Mather has a handful of big-ticket events. The most (in)famous of these is Mather Lather, the soapy rite of spring that takes place each year. Mather also has an ongoing series of intrahouse competitions called the Louie Cup, named after neighboring Louie's Superette.
Housing Quality: Housing is Mather's best feature. It is the only House where everyone—actually everyone—is guaranteed a single. Most sophomores live in the House's low-rise building, where split-level suites are the norm, while juniors and seniors tend to gravitate to Mather Tower, which boasts 18 floors of huge stand-alone singles.
Students looking for the classic Harvard experience will not find it here. Mather's rooms are a pastiche of concrete, carpet, and other mysterious composite materials. Dark hallways, especially in the House's low-rise wings, can be depressing and overrun with lost fêtards on a Friday night, but residents say huge windows and pest-free rooms more than make up for fluorescent entryways. Though their rooms are less conducive to partying, residents living in the Tower enjoy some of the best views in the area, along with the benefit of a space all their own.
Dining Hall: Mather dining hall is famous for its beautiful view of the Charles. Dinner at sunset is a unique treat for those who trek this far from the Yard. That said, most people eating in Mather on any given day are likely residents. The insularity makes for a warm and friendly dining experience, while ensuring that Mather regulars have plenty of space to spread out. Though the food is average, the kitchen is spacious, and the HUDS staff are accommodating.
Facilities: Built of reddish and grey concrete in the late 1960s and opened in 1970, Mather is no one's image of Harvard. But what it lacks in red brick and white paint it more than makes up for with huge amounts of common space. The gym and library are both among the biggest on the river. For study breaks, typical Junior and Senior Common Rooms are supplemented by a dedicated television room, pool tables, and ping pong tables. If couches and lounge chairs scattered around the House aren't enough for the weary, Mather has a Tranquility Room described on the House's website as "designed to imbue visitors with the sense of peace its name evokes."
Though Mather was historically a jock House, today it is home to some of the best art spaces on campus, with several music practice rooms, a pottery studio, a woodturning studio, and a multimedia room. The Three Columns Gallery between the dining hall and library features student art year round.
House Masters: Mather residents say they have little attachment to their masters, Christie A. McDonald and Michael D. Rosengarten. But McDonald, a professor in the Department of Romance Languages and Literature, and Rosengarten, an adjunct professor of Medicine at McGill University, have done a lot to reinvigorate the House's art scene and senior common room in the last few years.
Extra: Mather's biggest drawback is its location. At a brisk pace, the walk from the front gate to the Yard takes ten minutes. Residents will be quick to tell you that the Mather shuttle stop, proximity to Louie's convenience store, and adjacency to the river compensate for the House's distance from the Yard. You can be the judge.
