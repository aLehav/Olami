In keeping with the scale of its subject matter, “Megacities Asia,” the latest exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, extends throughout and beyond its gallery spaces. Enormous objects and site-specific sculptures are scattered throughout the museum—and even, in the case of Korean artist Choi Jeong Hwa’s “Breathing Flower,” on the front lawn. Much as they would circulate through an urban space, visitors walk in, around, and through installations. The pieces on display explore diverse issues of contemporary urbanism, from architecture to waste, from commercialization to transportation. The exhibition foregrounds the work of artists attempting to respond to the unprecedented scale and complexity of modern cities.
The MFA selected 11 artists from five megacities—cities with populations of over 10 million—for the show: Seoul, Shanghai, Beijing, Delhi, and Mumbai. Edward Saywell, chair of contemporary art and MFA programs at the museum, says that he believes “Megacities Asia” will inspire critically important conversations. “[The exhibition] deals with issues that are extraordinarily pressing in all of our lives, the extricable issues that are related to the rise of the megacity,” Saywell says. “Every time you Google ‘megacities’ the number [of them] seems to climb, and [with it], the attendant issues related to the environment, urbanism, health, transportation, education, and so forth.”
While regions across the world have seen dramatic surges in urbanization over the past 50 years, Asia has experienced the most rapid change: A majority of the world’s megacities are located on the continent. “There’s something really interesting happening in Asia in regards to urbanization,” says Laura Weinstein, curator of South Asian and Islamic art at the MFA. “What we really wanted to focus on is what’s changing now and what kind of dialogue that is sparking in the artistic community.”
Beijing-based artist Yin Xiuzhen, for instance, explores the relationship between the city and the citizen in her 2009-2010 work “Temperature.” In the piece, chunks of rubble from apartment buildings that have been razed in Beijing lie side by side, stuffed with bits of used clothing. Xiuzhen drew from the debris of both older 18th-century structures and much newer buildings not obviously in need of repair. “The artist has put the fabric into the little cracks in the rubble in a way that reflects the fact that she thinks of clothing as absorbing the human spirit—that everything you wear is on your body and absorbs and witnesses your identity, and the same thing [is true] for the walls of a home,” Weinstein says. Xiuzhen juxtaposes the violently destroyed brick with the tattered remains of colorful clothing. “It’s a way of suggesting that even though the buildings may be lost, the community persists,” Weinstein says. “The people that were evicted from those homes will find another place to take roots in the future.”
A similar conversation takes place in the 2008 work “Take Off Your Shoes and Wash Your Hands” by Delhi-based artist Subodh Gupta. A vast wall of stainless-steel utensils placed in rows greets visitors upon entering the gallery. Each row includes slight irregularities in its arrangement of cooking and eating implements. Weinstein connects these irregularities to Gupta’s larger vision of the modern city. “Even though you have this huge population packed close together, so tightly, there’s not a lack of humanity,” Weinstein says. She added that Gupta’s work evokes some key challenges in a densely populated city: feeding the masses and creating a sense of urban community. “All these households are connected through one another through food, and food is for this artist a way that a mass gathering of strangers becomes a community,” Weinstein says.
Artists featured in “Megacities” also reflect on the strains that urbanization places on the natural environment. In his 2011 piece “Super-Natural,” Korean artist Han Seok Hyun stacks and scatters a wealth of literally green items, only some of which are actually ecologically friendly, purchased in supermarkets in Boston and Korea. Hyun arranges the green products, which range from cleaning supplies to alcoholic beverages, into a configuration resembling a garden. He describes the piece as an examination of the increasing separation of urban consumers from the natural sources of their food. “For my parents, there is not [a] mass product system. They get many foods from the trees, or mountains,” Hyun says. “But now many kids say to their parents, ‘I want to go to the supermarket.’ Not often is [it] said, ‘I want to go to [the] river, mountain.’”
“Megacities Asia” thus surveys the global landscape of contemporary art to find moments when artists are in direct conversation with their surroundings. “Artists have always throughout history and across cultures been on the front lines of change, observing and responding to it,” says Al Miner, assistant curator of contemporary art at the MFA. “That’s clearly true with the issues that we’re dealing with in the exhibition.”
“Megacities Asia” will be on view on the MFA through July 17.

In terms of narrative, “10 Cloverfield Lane” is a far cry from its heavily marketed predecessor, 2008’s “Cloverfield.” But fans of the franchise need not worry—the movie is still triumphantly terrifying and manages to take on an even more curious and austere identity. Whereas eight years ago the original “Cloverfield” frightened its audience by way of dramatic visuals and exhilarating action scenes, “10 Cloverfield Lane” draws dread in a more silent and cerebral way under Dan Trachtenberg’s shrewd direction. Aided by a remarkably talented cast, solid cinematography, and a menacing musical score, the film unfolds to be a tremendously well-executed psychological thriller.
“10 Cloverfield Lane” tells the story of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) after she survives a car accident on an otherwise ostensibly normal day. When she regains consciousness, she is horrified to find herself trapped in an underground bunker. Shortly after, she meets Howard, (John Goodman) who claims that the air in the world above them is contaminated and that he has rescued her from death. The only other person in the bunker is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who seems to buy into Howard’s claims, making Michelle even more uncertain of what to believe. The film follows the three characters’ consequent interactions, which quickly become rooted in tension, deception, and mistrust.
All three lead actors deserve praise for brilliant performances that collectively serve as the strongest aspect of the film. However, as the premise of the storyline hinges largely on the portrayal of Howard’s character, Goodman’s delivery plays a particularly pivotal role in cohering the film, and the actor must be commended for his compelling interpretation. Rather than falling prey to the trope of the creepy captor—for which the screenplay, vacillating between trite and refreshing, gives dangerous pockets of opportunity—Goodman plays Howard’s character with sagacious restraint, delivering the bulk of his lines with a maddeningly neutral expression so as to sow uncertainty in the audience over whether or not his contentions are genuine. The film quickly comes to revolve around Howard’s credibility and in its entirety becomes a delightfully exasperating mind game, wherein we find ourselves pulled toward Howard, hopelessly transfixed on tracking Goodman’s carefully calculated speech and actions in our hunger for any scrap of further insight into his character. Goodman’s stellar performance propels the psychological dimension of the film and is the key to its riveting cerebral quality. Indeed, the magnetism of the film’s mind game is sustained and strong––until it falters as the movie nears its ending, where Goodman plays a lesser role. In his absence, the film fumbles for a definitive identity and stumbles over tedious tonal inconsistencies.
Still, throughout its majority, “10 Cloverfield Lane” takes on a decisively tense and confining atmosphere largely driven by its terrific coupling of cinematography and music. While the restrained spatial setting of the film—a small, claustrophobic bunker—easily presents the challenge of keeping viewers from being suffocated themselves by monotonous visuals, cinematographer Jeff Cutter transcends the issue. His varied shots prevent the setting from ever becoming tiresome. Shots that are deliberately uncomfortably close—putting full focus on Howard’s fidgety fingers, for example—make us hold our breath in unease. Exquisite, spacious shots, such as a wide shot of Michelle standing against a wall painted a soothing blush pink, cue a deep, relaxing exhale. Although somewhat unoriginal, the film’s musical score compliments these shots beautifully. Shrieking strings intensify scenes of apprehension, and quiet, thoughtful musical phrases accompany more subdued moments. The success of these elements makes for a gripping atmosphere that not once becomes overbearing.
While “Cloverfield” was entertaining enough, “10 Cloverfield Lane” makes it clear that it surpasses its predecessor in vigor and perspicacity. In refusing to succumb to predictability and in transforming its constricted space and small cast into unconventional strengths, “10 Cloverfield Lane” packs a great deal of punch and in spite of a somewhat muddled ending sequence proves itself an admirable directorial debut from Dan Trachtenberg.

Short-listed for the 2015 Man Booker Prize, “The Year of the Runaways” has recently been published in the United States to the acclaim that it undoubtedly deserves. British-Indian author Sunjeev Sahota’s sophomore novel is a political statement that addresses many difficult topics—from familial duty and faith in God to casteism and disillusionment of the world we live in—for an intensely immersive story that, through its forthrightness, shines light on the harsh realities of undocumented immigration.
The novel follows four characters in Britain, three of whom are undocumented immigrants from India, over the span of one year. After his father’s breakdown leaves his family with no income, Randeep goes to England on a marriage visa to become the family breadwinner, though he struggles to learn what it is to be a man. Avtar, on a student visa, must decide between sending money back home and paying off the thugs who lent him the money to get the visa in the first place—the same thugs threatening the family for which he left to provide. Tochi, an “untouchable” chamaar whose undocumented immigration on the back of a lorry is reflective of his low place in Indian society, suffers the ultimate price solely for having been born into a certain caste. And Narinder, faithful to her duties to both her family and her god, shirks the former responsibility in an eye-opening attempt to fulfill the latter. These characters, all from very different backgrounds come together to portray the experience of millions of voiceless young Indians who leave their countries, often illegally, in a desperate attempt to support their families and with the naive hope that their quality of life will vastly improve.
In keeping with his first novel, “Ours are the Streets," Sahota refuses to shy away from topics that would make many readers squirm. Ambitious in everything it tackles, “The Year of the Runaways” is a social critique of the many aspects of Indian society that Sahota has explicitly denounced in interviews. Narinder, for example, must surrender herself to God and a chosen husband to bring honor to her family, giving up the independence she never even knew she wanted. As Narinder questions and reconsiders the way she’s been living her life, Sahota’s feminist views trickle into his writing. Sahota’s other political opinions manifest in the narratives of his male characters. When Randeep questions the purpose for trekking into a foreign country, he naively believes that “it’s not work that makes us leave home and come here. It’s love. Love for our families.” Avtar immediately corrects him: “We come here for the same reason our people do anything. Duty. We’re doing our duty.” The characters start out believing that the years of destitution and deplorable work conditions in England are worth the lies they spew to themselves and their loved ones—lies about their success meant to ensure their families’ safety and well-being. But Sahota, through Tochi’s voice, presents a different viewpoint: “I used to think I had duties. That I had to know my place,” Tochi says. “It doesn’t work. People will be hurt. Don’t hurt yourself instead.” Tochi himself and his experiences as a victim of prejudice and hatred as a chamaar are the manifestation of Sahota’s poignant criticism of casteism. The characters not only are crucial elements of the narrative but also serve as tools that Sahota uses to denounce both aspects of Indian culture and Britain’s treatment of immigrants.
The novel prevails not only in the power of its myriad messages but also in the experience of reading it. Through its straightforward and candid language, the novel creates a rich depiction of the many darker facets of Indian life and culture, leaving readers disillusioned with the exoticized India they may be familiar with. Furthermore, Sahota makes palpable through his words a part of the United Kingdom many of its residents may not even know exists. His unapologetic use of untranslated Indian words—chunni, gurdwara, waheguru, dhal, sabzi, and soti, among others—enlaces aspects of the country in his diction. This technique fully captures the Indian culture not just when the characters are in India but—even more impressively—when they are in Sheffield, the city where their stories intertwine.
“The Year of the Runaways” offers parallels that reflect the core of what it is trying to do: denounce and demystify Indian immigration. From the juxtaposition of life in India and life in Sheffield to the conflict between duty to oneself and duty to one’s family, two different sides of the same coin are always in opposition to one another. “The weakest are those who stay put and call it sacrifice, call it not having a choice,” realizes Narinder near the end of the novel as she struggles with finding a balance between agency and obligation. Sahota’s novel succeeds in its criticism of the social pressures that put millions of Indians in these very positions by marrying the two sides of each character’s coin in a telling tale of the ends to which people will go for the sake of what they feel must be done.

UPDATED: April 7, 2016, at 2:02 a.m.
One often views performances for the enjoyment, taking away a pleasant feeling of satisfaction and perhaps a few themes incorporated by the writers. However, it is less common to see a play that grapples with serious issues in a way that is intended not for the pure entertainment of viewers but for the edification of the audience and the expression of the actors, writers, and directors. The Harvard Black Community and Student Theater’s latest production, “Black Magic,” which runs from April 1 to 9 at the Loeb Mainstage, is one such extraordinary play that wrestles with the topics of racism, homosexuality, and gender identity with raw and real emotion.
Directed by Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16 and written entirely by Harvard students, “Black Magic” is mainly the story of five Harvard students: Amari (Caleb M. Lewis ’17), Eli (Louis K. Aghanwa ’18), CJ (Tatiana DuBose-Butler '14), Syd (Ogechi Obed ’19), and Anika (Peryn Reeves-Darby ’18). Their everyday lives may seem familiar, but they present new opportunities to explore the feelings and experiences associated with being black at Harvard. The play approaches issues from a variety of viewpoints, with Amari learning about Harvard and romance for the first time, Eli trying to fix his strained relationship with his father, CJ and Syd dealing with the difficulties of harassment and the judgment of others, and Anika attempting to write for The Crimson about issues of race while staying true to herself. Although the “Black Table” is clearly surrounded by the same paintings one sees in Annenberg Hall, situating the play at Harvard, students in the play face the much broader issues of police violence and white privilege. Rather than shy away from these topics, the play bravely shows the feelings of the characters, whether it be crippling fear, resentment, anger, or hopelessness.
With a plot that directly deals with painful topics, the play requires actors who can express emotion in a way that is both realistic and truly raw. The play’s main actors rise to that challenge, providing a performance not only filled with authentic suffering but also representing multi-faceted human beings whose lives are filled with the joys of love and friendship as well as sadness. This is particularly true of DuBose-Butler’s portrayal of CJ and Lewis’s portrayal of Amari. DuBose-Butler delivers a powerful performance as CJ, a comedian, who uses the pronoun “they”. Many times outright hilarious, DuBose-Butler does a careful job of not letting comedy trivialize the serious issues her character faces; while comedy may be an important part of CJ’s life, it does not detract from the stalking, harassment, and judgment they have to endure as a black comedian. CJ’s frustration leads them to quit, but the love and support of others hope for a better future eventually sustains them.
In contrast to DuBose-Butler’s performance, which channels the disillusionment of years of maltreatment, Lewis’s portrayal of Amari begins optimistically. As a freshman, Amari is still learning about the routine racism many black Americans have to endure. He is portrayed as alternating between extreme enthusiasm and anger as he sees injustices in the world around him, but thanks to Lewis’s performance, rather than appearing forced, Amari’s feelings and behavior seem natural. Inhabiting a well-written character, Lewis is able to use this natural dichotomy to bring out his own natural acting style.
“Black Magic” gives black characters the space and depth so often denied to them. It is a reflection of life—and this fact is precisely what makes it so poignant. It is an experience that should not be missed.

Fans of electronic noise music often shoulder an implacable burden. They are responsible not only for assuring their friends and loved ones that the “creepy static” blaring from their headphones is not the mark of a budding nihilist but also for articulating the artistic merit of a seemingly ineffable musical experience without responding with bombastic stupor. Tim Hecker, a pioneering electronic composer from Canada, has a solution to their woes that is faithful to their music’s steamrolling intensity: Drown out the skeptics with nihilistic bombast. In a press release via his new label, 4AD, Hecker described his upcoming album’s title, “Love Streams,” as “a riff on the ubiquity and nihilism of streaming of all forms of life” and claimed that its sound was inspired by his desire to create “liturgical aesthetics after ‘Yeezus.’” If Hecker’s blurbs seem incomprehensible, stay calm; one does not need a Ph.D. in urban noise to make sense of the surprisingly accessible “Love Streams.”
“Love Streams” marks the inception of a new sonic palette in Hecker’s extensive discography. Beginning with his 2001 release “Haunt Me, Haunt Me Do It Again,” Hecker worked to perfect an increasingly brooding “ambient drone” texture that relied on hypnotic distortions of organ and piano. With his seventh full-length album, “Virgins,” Hecker reached new heights of intensity with an innovative sleight of hand—he employed call and response composition techniques to create an immersive space that resembled being in the live-room with Hecker and the Icelandic collective Bedroom Community. While he continues to work with the group on “Love Streams” by incorporating ghostly vocal arrangements that echo Holly Herndon’s debut LP, “Platform,” Hecker has abandoned what he self-mockingly told The Fader was characteristic of his earlier works: “metal overload.”
The tone of “Love Streams” is superficially warm and vibrant, but the tensions at play demand a more nuanced explanation. Hecker juxtaposes fuzzy ultraviolet synths with natural woodwind acoustics, distorts voices that are full of human pang until they sound incorporeal, and constantly fluctuates between oneiric ambience and unsettling static. The sonic diversity of the album produces several stellar moments. “Obsidian Counterpoint” begins with a serenity anchored by flute and synth lines that is soon interrupted by a series of disturbing clangs that sound like organs being whacked by obsidian. The song fades out with a wave of drone until a distant choir starts to creep its way to the listener. The following track, “Music of the Air,” allows the choir to assert its presence as disparate voices attempt to harmonize amidst a drowning static ambience. On “Violet Monumental I,” the voices sound more urgent yet more alien than before, until they fully disappear by the time “Violet Monumental II” comes around and dramatic synth lines return to the foreground. “Castrati Stack” is perhaps the best and most chaotic moment of the album—thunderous static clashes with majestic choir vocals until the listener is transported to a dizzying realm that feels like a technocrat’s altar.
Despite its finer songs, “Love Streams” feels less refined and coherent than some of Hecker’s previous works. “Virgins,” for instance, was comparably experimental and chaotic, but Hecker carefully orchestrated the chaos with a near-cinematic vision that arrested the listener from start to finish. On “Love Streams,” tracks do not progress in a way that feels wholly organic; songs like “Bijie Dream” are multi-layered but seem too muddled to benefit from the added acoustics. The album gives the impression that Hecker is tinkering with new textures but has not yet determined what narrative he wants to tell with them. There is a consistent aesthetic to the album that may require fans of Hecker’s harrowing density to listen several times before accepting his new direction but may also attract new listeners who prefer a balance between dissonance and melody. Whether you are noise-head whose favorite book is Nietzche’s “Thus Spoke Zarathustra” or you are curious to see what electronic noise is all about, the formula is the same: Listen with headphones and listen loud, and you may just love the streams that Hecker sends through you.
“Love Streams” is out on 4/8 via 4AD.

Greta Kline—stage name Frankie Cosmos—is 22 years old and set to release her cheekily titled 51st album, “Next Thing,” on April 1. This prolific number of records is possible because Kline started posting self-made music from the age of 13 on her Bandcamp page. Nevertheless, “Next Thing” is widely regarded as her sophomore album since it is the second to officially be released. That she got picked up is no surprise: She looks like a human incarnation of a Wes Anderson film, and her earnest lyrics against a folk-pop backdrop do not disappoint. Although Kline’s short, upbeat tracks do not always succeed in their attempts to combine musical and vocal dynamics, they have a cleverly muted charm and embody true “folk music” as contemporary.
Kline’s biggest asset is her lyrics. They are unsettlingly familiar sentiments built from the fine details of life, creating the surreal experience of witnessing thoughts never realized. They are fantastically insightful, ranging from profound (“Once I was happy, I found it intriguing.”) to funny (“You are bug bites on vacation,” “From the street, I see your window, / I look up. Is that even your house?”) to meditations reserved for best friends (“Do I belong?”, “I don’t know what I’m cut out for,” “I’m 20, washed up already.”). Still, Kline shines brightest in her honest and frank moments, like when “Is It Possible/Sleep Song” slows its poppy tune in time for “I guess I just make myself the victim like you said. / That’s why when you treat me shitty you get mad. / It all makes sense now thanks so much. / Good-bye forever, what the fuck.” Chronicling small pains alongside the big, Kline perfectly captures the sad awkwardness and biting self-loathing felt at the odds and ends of life, equal parts wide-eyed melodicism and the “aw shucks” misfortune and redemption narrative of a children’s cartoon show.
Vocally, Kline floats in on a high, sweet voice that she often takes even higher into a falsetto. Her voice is flat in a way that cannot be chalked up to bad singing but rather to an honest Auto-Tune-less portrayal of voice, which on the whole works for her. Unfortunately, her voice is overshadowed by the album’s instrumentation, but in the moments when it does come through, it carries the song much more strongly. Such is the case in “Fool,” the album’s best song, which also has a fantastic technique of layered instruments dropping suddenly to a singular vocal melody. Experimentation with vocals, too, is a wonderfully done maneuver in “Sappho,” where her voice echoes itself in an unassumingly flooring manner. The upbeat, chirpy tendency of the song melodies, however, fail, belying the thoughtful and at times brooding lyrical concepts. This problem is most apparent in “Tour Good,” the most serious song of the album, which from a musical perspective could easily be mistaken as the happiest.
Against a solidly steady drumbeat carrying the songs at around 120 beats per minute, the rest of Kline’s band—drums, guitar, and keyboard—elastically moves through homogeneous but still charming melodies to provide what should be a stripped-down supplement to her voice. Yet the instruments often overpower her delicate vocals, and the instrumental portion winds up carrying the melody. Still, the orchestration is well done, especially in its refusal to cop out on the songs’ endings with fades or equally heinous closings. Experimentation is more prevalent in certain songs: For instance, the ethereal cymbal background of “Floated In” fits the song well; the layering in “Embody” is truly remarkable; “Outside with the Cuties,” the best encapsulation of the album, has an interesting underwater-keyboard sound—“O Dreaded C Town” begins with water droplets that spark the gloomily nostalgic and utterly satisfying tone with which this album closes. This last song and “Is It Possible/Sleep Song” are also the two points in the album where the tempo was varied, slower and faster respectively, which is an excellent change to the beat.
“Next Thing” has a cultivated charm, more finished than Kline’s previously self-produced music, but winking amateurism is still thriving in this refreshingly quiet album amid modern music’s caps-locked shouting match. While it sounds like an indie coming-of-age film soundtrack, “Next Thing” has a convincing level of realism that makes it the music of the people, not of the industry. It is a matte soundtrack, not a glossy release. It has problems with vocal and instrumental dynamics, but these are easily overlooked for Kline’s signature heartfelt sincerity. Complete with in-jokes, bare self-awareness (including breaking the fourth wall in “Outside with the Cuties”), and squeaking instrumentals, Kline has evolved from “Zentropy” to something better than what she had before: The songs are the same, but they hit much harder. Lowercase lyrics and a humble yet devastatingly sharp insight carry these songs through their shrugging, anti-virtuosic demeanor into the next wave of folk-pop.
“Next Thing” is out via Bayonet Records on April 1.

UPDATED: APRIL 5, 2016, at 1:30 p.m.
In an age when the issue of sexual assault on college campuses has garnered increasing attention, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company aims to create a platform for discussion through its refocused, revitalized take on “Measure for Measure.” The Shakespeare play centers on the conflict that arises after stringent, straitlaced ruler Angelo sentences a man named Claudio to death for having engaged in sexual intercourse before marriage. Claudio’s sister, Isabella, though pious and chaste, fights for her brother’s right to live. Soon, a convoluted power construct evolves between the characters, and tension builds as the question of Claudio’s fate is left to deliberation.
Mikhaila R. Fogel ’16, president of the Hyperion Shakespeare Company and director of “Measure for Measure,” means for the production to encourage dialogue about Harvard’s sexual climate. “At the beginning of the year, when the results of sexual climate survey were released,” Fogel says, “the director for the Office of the Arts convened a meeting, gathering leaders in the arts, [asking,] ‘How could the arts respond to terrifying statistics about instances of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and coercion?’ I immediately thought of ‘Measure for Measure.’”
Driven by a vision to more accurately reflect present-day campus culture and sexual climate, Fogel looks to contemporize the centuries-old play through the use of modern costumes and props. She also aims to draw from film noir aesthetic elements, and in interweaving motifs such as shadowy lights and unsettling music hopes to elucidate problems surrounding the cycle of sexual violence as transparently as possible.
Members of the cast agree that Fogel’s direction in revitalizing “Measure for Measure” will prove insightful and significant. Brian A. Cami ’19, who plays Angelo, says that his character will appear more human and normal, rather than just one-dimensionally villainous. “What [will make] him so terrifying is that aspect of humanity,” Cami says. “In sexual assault, [it’s] not always just ‘bad’ people. Sometimes it’s ‘normal’ people.”
Moreover, though “Measure for Measure” hopes to revolve around serious themes, it also aspires to strike a careful balance between severity and lightheartedness. “Life isn’t all dark,” says cast member Kelley Guinn McArtor ’16. “[Fogel] really makes the light moments hilarious and memorable without taking away from the more serious material…. It’s a great illustration of the reality we live in.”
“Measure for Measure” will run April 8 to 16 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was little, my family used to joke that I was an elephant because of my memory. I would see someone wearing a shirt and cite a day years ago on which they wore the same thing. For years I’ve had better recall of the books my mother has read than she herself does. I sometimes joke that half the things I say are references to something, to some obscure line from a TV show that only I remember or to a throwback to some anecdote a friend told me weeks ago.
Part of my passion for binge-watching comes from the ability to draw connections, to notice the little moments of overlap between shows filmed years apart. I’m sure most of our generation remember the tossed-around fertility statue at the iconic party in “Mean Girls,” but I’ve seen that exact same moment appear in two television shows, at least one of which came before “Mean Girls.”
As an important element of my queer education, I recently finished binging “The L Word,” Ilene Chaiken’s quintessential story of a group of lesbians living in Los Angeles. In the final season, several lingering tensions between characters eventually boil over into physical violence during a 12-hour dance marathon hosted to raise money for the Los Angeles Lesbian and Gay Youth Center. It is impossible, at least for me, to consider dance marathons on television without hearkening back to the vintage-inspired dance marathon held in the beloved Stars Hollow of “Gilmore Girls.” The physical closeness and emotional exhaustion of such events creates a perfect setting for relationships to explode. Naturally, both dance marathons end in breakups. Watching Alice and Tasha of “The L Word” (whom I’d grown to love deeply over the past two seasons) reach a romantic impasse as they received the Last Couple Standing award, I recalled vividly the tear-streaked face of Rory Gilmore as her long-time boyfriend Dean dumped her and stormed off.
These moments were inevitable, but there’s somehow something tragic about heartbreak on the dance floor. Moments of triumph and tension are both harrowing and memorable; they fold public spectacle and an abnormal setting into the breakup to create a perfect storm of moments to remember and re-remember in perpetuity.
I don’t remember the moment of my breakup with my last boyfriend. It felt a long time coming, I suppose, my own pulling-away inevitable as I watched him continue to try to love me the way he had before. I was not Rory Gilmore or Tasha Williams, falling in love with the new-in-town bad boy or the kindhearted activist. There was no one else, and perhaps that’s why for the life of me I can’t recall the words I used. I’m not used to my memory failing me like this.
There’s an episode of “How I Met Your Mother” where Ted gives his friend Barney lessons in how to date Robin, Ted’s ex. When Robin finds out (and is understandably unamused), she confronts Ted. He says to her in response, “It’s funny; when you date someone, it’s like you’re taking one long course on who that person is, and then when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It’s the emotional equivalent of an English degree.”
As a Folklore and Mythology major, I can relate. My mind is full of tales of a family in Cuba I’ll probably never meet. I still have his colorblindness, his favorite professors, his past girlfriends, the way he told me he loved me (till we were dust and bone). The hardest part of breaking up wasn’t so much losing him as it was realizing that I had a metaphorical box of stuff that belonged to him stored on a shelf in my mind—and that I didn’t know what the hell to do with it.
At the end of the dance marathon, when the last couple standing breaks up and the crowd goes home, the credits usually roll. Rory moves on with Jess, Alice finds Jenny Schecter’s body, and the world keeps going. TV doesn’t have room for mopping the sweat up off the floor, for the messy cleanup, for the little things you leave behind.
Hours before my last breakup, I put on a necklace I hadn’t worn in years. “Amor Fati,” it reads. Love your fate.  As we held each other, crying, she asked me what it meant. “What a necklace,” she said. Breakups are something of an act of untangling, of breaking out of hold, of taking off the number and throwing it away. Just as the music stops, things end, and all you want to do is sleep. Moving on looks like waking up. It’s nursing the blisters and hanging up the costume. But there will always be another dance marathon. And we’ll do it all over again.

The Other Noah
Other Noah: Peter’s Adam, his first. That first night freshman year: all the quiet, electric anticipation from a summer’s worth of Facebook messaging, culminating in a collision like a cacophonous wave. Losing his virginity had felt to Peter like his ribs were being wrenched apart, like a bird being cracked open down the center to be feasted upon—meat. He was submerged in the serene broth and gravy of the night. Other Noah buoyed him so he wouldn’t sink deeper, or else held his body under the surface. All at once he was exposed. He was a sex person: a person who had sex now. His virginity was somewhere among the shards of shattered bone and bits of torn flesh and plucked feathers. He felt free, yet it seemed a gate had closed. Neurons within his head died and interwove; he had learned a thing.
They fell in love in the inevitable and insufficient way in which two bodies that fold together perfectly often do. For nearly seven months, the Other Noah bubbled up in Peter’s blood, made him feel sick and pressurized, kept him up at night. Then Peter met Noah in the foam and flood, and the atoms in his world began to buzz a little brighter.

Quad Walk
Would Peter walk him to the Quad, Michael’s text inquired. The ArchAngels had been out in Boston the night before. He met Michael in his room. Peter talked to him casually as Michael  glacially shuffled to gather his things, sat for a minute, and then shuffled some more. Peter only left to grab Michael some water. This was the first time they’d spoken since he started living in Noah’s room. The awkwardness was surreally comforting to them both. Peter dropped Michael  off at the SOCH, made sure he felt alright, and rode the shuttle back.

Sweet Cupcakes
Other Noah licked the cream cheese frosting off the round, red head. “What d’you mean?”
“I don’t know. I just have a thing about birthdays,” Peter mumbled through a generous bite. “I feel like if you miss someone’s birthday, you’re just out of sync with them. They’ve grown without you. So now you two are on, like, separate roads.”
“It’s just a day.”
“I’m not saying it’s logical.”
Other Noah shook his head and stared at Peter. It was Michael’s day, but in the center of the fifth-floor Grays common room, it felt as if it were all theirs.

Candid
Peter happened on Raquel heading back to the room from breakfast. She was dressed in leggings, purple socks, and an old Grays t-shirt. Her head was angled towards the wall as if she were observing something tiresome along the edge of the carpet. The flat hallway lighting illuminated the cascades of gold, cinnamon, and brown curls that hung down from her face.
It reminded Peter of a moment in August, walking through the Yard, when he’d suddenly had the urge to hold Raquel’s hand. How defiant, he’d thought, to so publicly display their platonic affections toward one another. It would have worked only with Raquel. She understood the magic in holding hands. Their eyes met with only three feet of carpet between. They were gaining on each other. She said hello first, grinning.

Formalities
Peter thought it might feel more glamorous fighting in tuxes, but it wasn’t. Peter’s voice still rose higher than he wanted. Noah called him a monster. Peter knew Noah’s roommate could hear them through the walls. He didn’t care. He wasn’t ungrateful. He was trying. If the intensity of the emotions he felt made him monstrous, well…
He returned to his old bed in Paradise. He bumped into Uriel. She liked his new haircut. Had he gotten it for formal?

Fibbage
“Pre-game snack run?” Gabriel shouted, throwing on his coat.
Peter and the ArchAngels flooded into the hallway.
“Stairs or elevator?” Uriel polled. Peter turned and saw Noah and his roommate headed for the elevator.
“Stairs,” Michael suggested. The others agreed. Michael smiled at Peter, sheathing his righteous sword.

Revelations
Other Noah was in his common room, as were the ArchAngels. Michael’s head drooped forward. The room was host to the lethargic chaos of drunks attempting to both keep the party going and care for a fading Michael.  Other Noah’s eyes met Peter’s. Lightning flashed in his mind, electrifying his synapses.
“Peter! Where were you?”
“I–”
“Why weren’t you at Michael’s birthday?” he asked. Raquel and Gabriel’s wings tensed. Michael’s birthday was in August. In August, Peter would have been invited.

Freshman Winter
Peter burst out of Canaday. Other Noah’s heart lay shattered on his carpeted floor. Peter wasn’t sure where he was headed.

One Year Later
“Where are you—?”
The closing door silenced Other Noah as Michael was shuffled into the bathroom. Peter was headed to the river.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a University-wide report on sexual assault that lambasted final clubs, the A.D. Club announced that next fall, it will host an “open Punching process,” implement a members-only guest policy, and mandate a sexual assault prevention training program for its undergraduate members beyond what it anticipates the University eventually requiring. Though the decision to hold an open punch—allowing all male undergraduates to try their hands at joining—is a step in the right direction, we remain concerned about the pace and extent of progress on the issue of final clubs.
Indeed, amid its efforts to become more inclusive, the club did not announce plans to open its membership to non-male students—an action that two of the other formerly all-male clubs have taken. This breaking down of gender barriers is a necessary step towards making the punch process and these clubs truly open.
An open punch also does not necessarily mean that the club will change its selection process. Since the same individuals will be selecting the next batch of undergraduate members, it is possible that this change will be cosmetic only and not significantly change the makeup of the club.
Another problem is the logical dissonance between two of the A.D. Club’s reforms. While the members-only policy would bar the entry of guests to their clubhouse, the implementation of a sexual assault training program would be most useful in social situations involving members and non-members alike. The implementation of the former policy diminishes the purpose of the latter and raises the concern that the training program is little more than a cosmetic attempt to placate the administration. Despite these concerns, more sexual assault training is never a bad thing, and the effort is laudable.
Even if all final clubs were to hold an open punch and open up to all genders, the problems of sexual assault and diversity would likely persist. Further, such reforms would be unable to change the fact that these final clubs are social spaces founded on the basis of exclusivity.
Therefore, in addition to reforming the final clubs to make them safer and more inclusive spaces, the College should look to build up the surrounding social scene rather than simply tear down the final clubs. The clubs have developed their dominance over social life at Harvard in the absence of better options. The University has the resources to form alternative social spaces, and in doing so, reduce the dominance of final clubs. Early attempts to create more open parties for undergraduates have been met with success, and administrators should continue expanding opportunities for similar initiatives.
Ultimately, both the clubs and the University have more work to do in order to build a more inclusive social scene on campus. Measures like open punch are parts of the solution, but final clubs aren’t the whole problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last September, on a Wednesday night, I found myself in a daze crying on the iconic steps of Widener. I’d always thought that if I ever cried on the steps of Widener, it would be after commencement and the final full Class of 2018 photo. I would be crying because of all I had accomplished over the past four years; or I would be crying because I still didn’t feel ready for adult life and the real world.
But instead, I was crying because life at Harvard is not always as picturesque as the hallowed steps of Widener—the same steps that represent the idea of this school and everything we want it to be, that are photographed thousands of times each day by tourists and prospective students trying to capture the façade of the University. I was crying because there would be one person who wouldn’t be in that Class of 2018 photo, one young man who couldn’t be proud of what he’d accomplished, one friend who couldn’t be scared of the real world. I was crying because I had just left Luke Tang’s memorial service.
Death on a campus of Harvard’s size is complicated. So much of the student body is interconnected—as classmates, teammates, Housemates, blockmates. The passing of a student can hit hard, resonating emotionally and personally. Even for students who are unacquainted with the deceased, though the immediate impact might be minimal, the true effect is slow acting, working its way into thoughts and reflections subtly over time.
It is difficult to be so near to the place and moment of death but so far removed from its circumstances and its victim. It is difficult to find yourself six months after the event, remembering that you forgot about the tragedy and wondering how something with such startling impact managed to evaporate from the campus psyche. This is the saddest part: That we mourn heavily for a week or two and subsequently get distracted by the business of daily life on campus.
But what I took away from the complicated days, weeks, and now months following Luke’s death was this: Life needs to be more important to us than death.
In this world, in this country, on this campus. We need to focus more on life, on living well. Of course, we should take our time to stop and mourn someone’s passing, but we should strive too to honor the lives of those around us every day. Dying is scary, dying young is scarier, but living with an eye towards death is the scariest. Trying to make our lives into what we think they should be—in terms of goals or accomplishments—before we die is a daunting and often impossible task because it cannot account for the randomness of life itself.
Focusing on living well means placing as much attention and importance on ensuring the day-to-day quality of our lives as on pursuing the end goals that we all strive towards, whether it is a job at Bain, a fellowship at Oxford, a volunteer teaching position, or a spot in the NBA. We need to enjoy the ride that takes us to these places, not make the ride so excruciating or overwhelming that we wonder why we embarked in the first place.
Of course college is meant to be academic, but college is more gestalt than that: Classes work best in conjunction with meeting interesting people, trying new things, and enjoying yourself. Doing so makes the prospect of life’s shortness that much less frightening, hopefully leaving us with less ‘what ifs’ and more paths taken.
An emphasis on improving the quality of our lives can help improve the discussions about mental health as well. When we start enjoying the journey without getting distracted by the destination (the Emersonian cliché), we can improve our own lives both here on this campus and beyond. When we don’t put our heads down and drudge through life to some final destination, we can see life as it happens around us, including the not-so-nice parts. We can admit to ourselves that we need help, that we are unhappy, that we are feeling lonely. We can get the help we need from the resources we need. We can refocus and recognize that these trials are universal, normal, human.
And when we take care of ourselves by acknowledging these normal parts of life, we can make each other’s lives better. We can stop using homework as an excuse to not ask others how they are really doing and stop using back-to-back office hours as a way to avoid listening to our friends when they ask for help. We can stop trying to meet the expectations created by the façade and legacy of Widener and acknowledge what really lives at this university—what we see in it every day that the tourists’ cameras cannot capture: The sometimes stressful, sometimes wonderful, and sometimes terribly dark lives of ourselves and our peers.
We can take ownership of this place and use Widener as a shoulder to cry on rather than a monument to idolize. We can enjoy life here. All of us, and now one less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living in a place like Harvard’s campus makes the role of history in our everyday lives painfully self-evident. The stoic blue and green eyes that look down from every wall silently judge us all as we move through the halls they owned but did not build. We shuffle through the Yard hoping that congregating in large numbers will not attract too much attention. Few will openly say we do not belong; it falls upon us to discern these feels and reassure ourselves that we, too, are Harvard.
These are the first thoughts that ran through my head after reading the op-ed that President Drew Faust published last week in The Crimson. President Faust not only announced the unveiling of a plaque acknowledging the black bodies that Harvard faculty dehumanized by claiming to own them. More importantly, President Faust did not mince words, concretely admitting that “Harvard was directly complicit in America’s system of racial bondage from the College’s earliest days in the 17th century until slavery in Massachusetts ended in 1783, and Harvard continued to be indirectly involved through extensive financial and other ties to the slave South up to the time of emancipation.”
In the following days, I have heard many opinions and reactions to Faust’s op-ed from my black friends. Some argue that attaching the plaque to the building ties the spirits of those black bodies to the place of their plunder and perpetual torture. Others applaud the administration for finally openly addressing the school’s historical ties to slavery. Amidst all these takes, I can’t help but think we’re all missing the point.
This should be easy. Putting up a plaque to commemorate a dark moment in our collective history only requires acceptance of the truth. Acknowledging Harvard’s role in the larger system of slavery, both by being administratively complicit and by producing prominent slavery advocates, should be a given. For an institution that claims to train the future leaders of the world, educate the next generation of academics, and strive to always seek truth, accepting indisputable historical facts should not warrant celebration.
Harvard’s troubled history with race relations and systems of racism goes far beyond slavery. People of color did not simply become equal at Harvard after members of the faculty were forced to give up their slaves. Once the powers that be stamped out codified racism, a more insidious, implicit form of racism rose from the darkest depths of the human soul to take its place.
We see this when someone calls HUPD because too many black people are in the Quad Yard for a barbecue. We suffer its wrath when we seek out faculty members that look like us only to find a shrinking crop of overworked POC professors. We experience it through the struggles we simply have to tell on the mainstage so the world can know we are here.
What if, next year, I  live in a house with no black tutors or people of color? Who am I supposed to turn to if I have a race related issue that does not break any rules to merit administrative action? When someone in section argues that black kids only get into Harvard through affirmative action, whom can I talk to? I will not turn to a white tutor with this pain. I invite intellectual conversations about any racial issue under the sun, but I will only share my pain with someone that knows how it feels to get followed through Toys “R” Us by an untrusting employee, even though you’re only there because your dad said you could get a new toy.
I appreciate that President Faust has taken this step towards legitimately addressing Harvard’s relationship with race, but I am reluctant to thank her. At this juncture, thanks seem inappropriate. While President Faust has done more than many of her predecessors, that’s not saying much: Her predecessors claimed other human beings as property on their tax forms. An aesthetic remodeling of a building with symbolic significance does not create institutional change. At the end of the day, Harvard has not changed. Its history remains riddled with unnamed and forsaken black bodies, untold stories of the exploitation and marginalization of scores of POCs, and a continued struggle to claim ownership of an institution we were meant to have no part in.
When we achieve substantive change, I will rush to the front of the reception line to thank anyone and everyone involved. When Harvard opens a multicultural center for all the groups on campus that feel excluded from the infrastructure of the campus, I will write every donor and administrator a thank you letter. When the administration hires professors that look like the student body to fill the cavernous curriculum holes from Latinx Studies and black queer theory, I will name my first-born child after the President at the time. But something tells me I will likely be naming my first grandchild after a Harvard President instead.

I show up to the "Back on My Feet" event at Barbara McInnis House in South Boston on an unusually balmy Wednesday at 6:30 a.m. The four runners gathered in the lobby look ready for anything, though running would not be my first guess. One woman holds onto a walker, another man leans on a cane, and a younger man walks with a limp. All of them have been walking or running—decked out in “Back on My Feet” gear—through every kind of weather Boston threw at us this winter. They are consistent participants in the nonprofit, which aims to fight homelessness through a combination of extending community resources and promoting fitness.
Today, the team is walking a two-and-a-half-mile loop up less-than-scenic Albany St., an urban area near a large highway interchange. We split into smaller groups; one participant lopes ahead, a large Dunkin Donuts iced coffee swinging by his side in rhythm with the chain around his neck. The two older men of the group stroll behind us alongside a volunteer.
I walk with Kathleen Lau, Back on My Feet’s program director, and Donna, whom Kathleen introduces as “a speed demon with a walker.” Decked out in leggings, a black windbreaker, bright sneakers, a white baseball cap, and a fluorescent yellow backpack, Kathleen looks like one of Boston’s most committed marathoners. In fact, she explains that she became involved with Back on My Feet after seeing their logo worn by other runners during a race. Now, she spends her mornings walking or running with one of seven community groups and her days recruiting and figuring out logistics for the organization. She has helped bring Back on My Feet into its sixth year, working with participants who are dealing with homelessness, unsteady housing, treatment programs, or recent incarceration. The volunteers who walk or run with them include doctors, retirees, and college students.
Many participants get involved with Back on My Feet at their doctor’s recommendation, because of health problems that can be addressed through exercise. Donna interrupts Kathleen’s pitch with her personal story: “I’ve lost 260 pounds with Back on My Feet. I weighed about 500 to begin with.” Now, she sets the pace for both Kathleen and me as she deftly maneuvers her walker over the bumps and twists in the sidewalk.
“I didn’t think you were gonna make it when you first started,” Kathleen says, in awe. “I don’t know how you did it, lady.”
Participants like Donna face challenges beyond health problems. When she first became involved with Back on My Feet, Donna was living in cramped, unsanitary housing so bad that it was eventually reported to the city. The organization, though, was up to the challenge: They aim to create a citywide network that can refer participants to jobs and housing. Forged through countless 5:45 a.m. runs in rain, snow, or shine, the group also provides support for members struggling with sobriety. “[A] couple people will still call me if they think they’re gonna use,” Donna tells me.
We turn back early at Donna’s request. This has nothing to do with her walker, which has not stopped her from participating in races—“You get lost, but you make it,” Kathleen laughs—and has certainly not slowed her down today. “I want to look for anyone who might have gotten stuck behind us,” she explains. “I like to watch out for everyone who walks with us.”

Harvard Student Agencies celebrated the grand opening of a new Harvard Shop at 34 JFK Street this past weekend, following the closure of a separate location due to renovations to Harvard’s Smith Campus Center.
About 200 people attended the opening, according to the Harvard Shop’s managing director Harrison J. Choate ’17. The event featured free coffee, frozen yogurt, and discounted prices on all items throughout the afternoon.

HSA president Stephen W. Xi ’17 said the organization used the event to appeal to a wider consumer base.
“We wanted to make it a student-centric event, because we are a student-run business,” Xi said. “We wanted to include the Harvard community, and by giving out freebies, and organizing a student performance, we could help achieve that goal.”
According to Choate, student managers worked closely with other Harvard Square businesses throughout the planning process to foster camaraderie among local vendors.
“Our partnerships manager was reaching out to different businesses to see if they’d like to take part in the event, to foster friendly relations with the Harvard Square business community,” Choate said.
HSA also partnered with the Harvard Lowkeys a capella group, which performed at the event.
Grace C. Ramsey ’19, a member of the Lowkeys, said the group appreciated the opportunity to perform in a more “informal” setting, where they could perform in front of friends in a free, non-ticketed environment.
“The people at the Harvard Shop were really energetic,” Ramsey said. “I think that all the kids there were having a great time, and we thought it was really fun, as well.”
Xi said several factors impacted the decision to open the shop in the new venue.
“When the location came up, it seemed like a perfect place to do it: it’s a great hub for activity, there’s a lot of people going in and out, and there’s so many new businesses opening up in the area,” Xi said. “In opening a new store, we hope to continue to offer meaningful employment opportunities for Harvard students.”

Stephen J Toope ’79, current Director of the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, spoke about ways that Canada could become more engaged in global affairs this Monday at a seminar organized by the Canada Program of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
During the seminar, Toope argued that in order for Canada to have a more robust role in foreign affairs, the country must realistically assess where it stands in the changing world, evaluate its assets as a nation, and then set realistic goals.
He added that the current administration has a tendency to look back at past liberal eras for inspiration, and though the practice is not unusual, it is critical to remember how the current world is different than past eras.
“I think a nostalgia for liberal internationalism could derail attempts to really rethink Canadian foreign policy in a sophisticated way,” Toope said.
Ali Hamandi, a graduate student who attended the event agreed with Toope’s presentation. Hamandi was a 2014 Trudeau Scholar of the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, where Toope was President from 2002 to 2006.
“I think it’s important that we reassess our position in the world, how to move going forward, and to realize what our strengths and weaknesses are, and to accordingly craft a new foreign policy strategy,” Hamandi said.
Referencing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s recent visit  to the United States—the first official visit by a Canadian prime minister in 19 years—Toope said that although Canada is usually not a main interest of the United States, the country had full-attention in the capital for a couple days.
“There seemed to be a genuine interest in what is a very important bilateral relationship,” Toope said. “We still have huge trade interest across the border, and we share a lot of values, and we’ve worked together on many issues in the last 100 years, at least.”
About 20 people attended the event, including faculty members, junior scholars of the Canada program, PhD students, undergraduates, and local residents.
Monday’s event was just one among many from the Canada Program, which invites prominent scholars and experts in various fields to speak and shed light on wide range of issues pertaining to Canada's relationship to the United States.
“The idea is to also promote conversations amongst people within the Harvard community about issues and research ongoing about Canada,” said Professor Alison Mountz, a visiting Professor of Canadian Studies this year and the main organizer of the seminars.

Although the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has yet to approve a proposed special joint concentration with Germanic Languages and Literatures, the German department has been aggressively publicizing the initiative, often “jumping the gun” and referring to the proposal as a done deal, according to German Department Chair John T. Hamilton.
On March 7, days after The Crimson published an article on the proposed joint concentration, German Department Administrator Sean M. McCreery sent an email linking to the article to a German department list-serv with the subject line “GLL Joint Concentration featured in The Crimson!”
“[The article] is a wonderful explanation of how the joint concentration scheme [with SEAS] will work and demonstrates how eager students are for it!” read the email.
Days later, another email was sent to students enrolled in German from McCreery’s account. This time signed by Assistant Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies Nicole A. Sütterlin, the email publicized an Advising Fortnight event titled “How to get a job in Germany, Europe and Beyond.”
In the email, Sütterlin described the event as an “info session on the new Special Joint Concentration in German... specially designed for Students in Engineering and the Applied Sciences.”
In addition to the email blast, Sütterlin visited introductory German classes to publicize the event and hand out special flyers again advertising the “special joint concentration in German for students in Engineering and Applied Sciences.”
After the Advising Fortnight event last Wednesday, Hamilton called this bevy of advertising for a yet-to-be-approved concentration a mistake.
“It was just a complete misunderstanding. If anything, it’s a signal of the enthusiasm on our side to make [the joint concentration] happen,” Hamilton said. “We don’t want the faculty at SEAS to think that things are being done without consulting them.”
In an email after the event, Sütterlin also said the joint concentration had been advertised mistakenly, calling the communications “an unfortunate error on my part.”
“I had misunderstood and believed the ratification process already to be completed, when in fact it is currently in its final stages,” Sütterlin wrote.
The miscommunication comes at a time of high growth for SEAS, and faltering enrollment in the humanities. While SEAS has enjoyed skyrocketing enrollment and capital-campaign prestige in recent years, German consistently has “around ten” concentrators, according to Hamilton, who noted that the department had over 100 students enrolled in the department’s language program.
As of now, the proposed joint concentration, which Hamilton pioneered last semester, would consist of a full SEAS degree, five higher-level German courses, and a “guided reading” course completed in conjunction with a summer engineering or applied sciences fellowship in Germany.
Hamilton added that the proposal was subject to change based on SEAS’s comments.
With just five German courses, Hamilton says the German requirements in the proposed joint concentration would be “pretty much a secondary field, but enhanced by the internship abroad.”
Leib I. Celnik ’18, who is currently earning a secondary in German, said he “wouldn’t be surprised that [GLL] would want to grow the concentration,” adding that he thought the proposed joint concentration was a good idea.
“There’s no real negative to having an interdivisional program like this,” said Celnik, who is the editor-in-chief of Simplicissimus, the College’s journal of Germanic studies. “It could open up some of the guidelines for other concentrations that want to cross the divisions,” he added.
According to an email from Hamilton, the German department will soon present a draft of the proposal to SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III. Ultimately, the SEAS faculty must vote on whether to approve the joint concentration proposal.
“We're all hoping that the faculty discussion and vote can still take place before this semester is over,” Hamilton said.
SEAS’s executive dean for education and research Fawwaz Habbal did not respond to request for comment on SEAS’s deliberations on the proposal.

UPDATED: April 5, 2016, at 5:15 p.m.
Projections, live cameras, and moving walls were just some of the more experimental features of the first production sponsored by the new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration at Farkas Hall on Friday.
The new concentration, which launched last October and currently has nine sophomore concentrators, requires all of its students to participate in four productions, two of which must be “concentration productions” that are not led by student groups. This weekend’s show was the first such production.
Directed by Marcus Stern, the associate director of the American Repertory Theater, “The Man Who” by Peter Brooks brought together students and professionals to work on every aspect of the show, according to Martin Puchner, a professor of Drama and chair of the TDM department.
“We just started in October, so the spring was our first chance to do a bigger show,” Puchner said. “We’re going to present a whole spectrum of shows; some really student-generated thesis projects, and on the other end of the spectrum, bigger productions like this one where we invite a lot of professionals to work with students.”
Bringing students and professionals together was challenging at times, according to stage manager Emily E. Bergquist ’18, who said it was sometimes difficult to coordinate with professionals and students who operate on very different schedules.
“The idea of this form of a professional and student team was a new concept, and there was a lot of figuring out what works as we went,” Bergquist said. “I’m a full-time student, whereas these people, this is what they do for a living...  There was a lot of everyone being as flexible as possible, learning as we went with what works and doesn’t.”
In addition to giving students the opportunity to work with professional designers and technicians, the show was a chance to prove the viability of combining the concentration’s three constituent parts, Puchner said.
“All the people who collaborated were very conscious of the fact that it was the first TDM show,” Puchner said. “We really wanted to demonstrate how we could combine theater, dance, and media in a technically complicated and very interesting show.”
According to some of the show’s four student actors, working with video and media components was both exciting and nerve wracking.
“It was hard at times,” Juliana N. Sass ’17, one of the cast members, said of working with the media portions of the production, particularly live cameras whose images were projected onto screens in the theater. “It was awesome to get to learn how to have spontaneous moments and connections and interactions with our scene partners, sometimes maybe even because of the intimacy of the camera.”

CORRECTION:  April 5, 2016
A previous version of this article indicated that Theater, Dance, and Media had five sophomore concentrators. In fact, TDM has nine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 5, 2016, at 2:15 a.m. 
Kenji Yoshino ’91, a constitutional law professor at New York University, will serve as the next president of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University announced Monday.
Yoshino will lead the University’s second highest governing body along with Nicole P. Haughey ’93, who will serve as the vice chair of the Overseers Executive Committee for the 2016-2017 academic year.
Thirty Harvard affiliates serve on the Board of Overseers to advise University leaders, review schools and departments, and approve decisions made by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Alumni elect Overseers to six-year terms on the body; earlier this month, voting began in an unusually lively race for the five open seats.
Yoshino and Haughey will succeed Karen Nelson Moore ’70, a federal judge, and Diana Nelson ’84, an executive at the Carlson hotel and travel group, in their relative posts. Both elected in 2011, Yoshino and Haughey will fill the Overseers’ top leadership roles for the final years of the six-year terms.
“Kenji Yoshino and Nicole Parent Haughey are both remarkably thoughtful leaders, and I am eager to work closely with them in their new roles on the Board,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement.
Yoshino, a Rhodes scholar, currently chairs the Overseers committee on the humanities and arts. He also served on a University-wide task force dedicated to preventing sexual assault that released its final report earlier this month.
Haughey spent much of her career in the corporate and financial world, including as vice president for corporate strategy at United Technologies and as a managing partner at Vertical Research Partners LLC. At Harvard, she has served on the governing board’s joint committee on alumni affairs and development and the Overseers executive committee.
"Harvard is a wonderful place and as the first person in my family to attend college, it transformed my life in so many ways and for that I am forever grateful," Haughey wrote in an email. 
Yoshino and Haughey rise to the helm of the Overseers in the midst of a contentious race for the Overseers’ five open seats. Earlier this year, Ron K. Unz ’83 and four of his peers launched a controversial bid for the governing body on a two-fold platform: eliminate undergraduate tuition and make public more data about Harvard’s admissions process.
Harvard will announce the results of that election in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Demanding more diversity in Harvard’s doctoral programs, members of the graduate student unionization effort, along with undergraduates and university employees, rallied for the formation of a collective bargaining unit just steps away from University President Drew G. Faust’s office last Friday.
The event, organized by the Civil Rights Committee of the unionization effort, brought together speakers from a broad spectrum of racial, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds outside of Massachusetts Hall. Organizers demanded that administrators address pipeline issues—obstacles that lead to higher attrition rates for underrepresented minorities in doctoral programs.
Felix Owusu, a graduate student and a member of the Civil Rights Committee who led the protest to the crowd of roughly 60 people, spoke about the issues minorities face in graduate education, including academic isolation, lack of a support system, and relatively few minority faculty who can serve as mentors to minority students.
“They told me that I would face isolation here. They told me that well-meaning institutions, even ones that meant the best, would be woefully unprepared in supporting me,” Owusu said, referring to cautionary warnings other minority students gave him about pursuing a Ph.D.
“I would not be up here, where I am today or at this institution, if it were not for a supportive group of graduate student workers who showed me solidarity and prepared me for what I was going to be facing,” Owusu added.
While several students touched on their personal experiences as minorities, graduate student David Nee spoke of his experience coming from a background of what he considered privilege.
Nee said being a “mixed-race man who passes for white” and coming from an upper-middle class family where both of his parents received Ph.D.s from Harvard “cushioned” him against the issues that minority students face.
Owusu said a collective bargaining unit provides a “clear vehicle for change.” In late February, members of the union effort announced that a majority of graduate students employed by the University supported unionization.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administration has sought to increase diversity within the school. In the 2014-2015 school year, eight percent of enrolled students were underrepresented minorities.
“Diversity and inclusivity are central to the mission of GSAS and essential to maintaining the intellectual excellence of Harvard University,” associate dean for academic programs and diversity Sheila Thomas wrote in an email.
Undergraduate student Brianna Suslovic ’16, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, said visibility is important to show minority students that a doctoral education is possible.
“How am I supposed to feel about a career in academia when there are so few TFs of color, when there are so few graduate students of color who are visible to me?” Suslovic said.
GSAS has created several summer outreach programs in effort to help fix the pipeline, such as the Summer Honors Undergraduate Research Program, which places minority undergraduates in research labs and matches them with graduate students for informal mentoring.
"Our commitment to recruit and mentor a diverse community of scholars in our Ph.D. programs extends back decades,” Thomas wrote. “It continues today with new and enhanced strategies for recruitment, pipeline program development, admissions, and community building to support a diverse student body.”
Owusu said there was no shortage of supporters from diverse backgrounds who wanted to share their experiences at the rally. Dining hall workers, women in STEM, and a at least one member of Reclaim Harvard Law joined the union effort members.
High-energy chants, such as “Harvard fix your leaky pipes, support grad workers of all stripes” punctuated the rally. A few freshmen living in Matthews trickled outside because of the noise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 denounced offensive messages last Friday that some admitted students had posted in an unofficial group chat for the Class of 2020.
Last Thursday, the College admitted 1,119  regular decision applicants and invited them to join the official Class of 2020 Facebook page. At the time, the page included a link to the unofficial messaging group that would instigate a dispute, according to Fitzsimmons and Khurana.
Recent posts from the group chat, titled “Cambridge Community College (Triple C Gang)” and hosted in the GroupMe messaging app, prompted controversy among incoming students. Some graphics parodied trading cards and included racially charged jokes, according to screenshots of the messages. Another user in the GroupMe included a screenshot of a tweet mocking feminists.
The messages prompted criticism from some students and an official response from Khurana and Fitzsimmons.
“Harvard College and the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid were troubled and disappointed to see a conversation that included graphics with offensive themes. This exchange occurred independently of Harvard College through a link posted by students to a closed messaging group, and we have removed this link from our Facebook group,” they wrote in a post on the Class of 2020’s Facebook page.
Interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said in an interview that the students who posted the messages in question have not received any disciplinary action and “are not matriculated students at this point.”
“We encourage our admitted students to gather online and get to know one another and have offered a Facebook group for this purpose,” Khurana and Fitzsimmons wrote in their statement posted to the Facebook group.
Although many admitted students said they were not aware of the controversial posts before Khurana and Fitzsimmons’s statement, the high school students said they were surprised that prospective Harvard undergraduates would circulate such messages.
“I thought it was weird because people people liked the [Facebook] post but nobody commented on it, so I don’t think anybody really wanted to get involved with that,” said Cherri L. Wang, an admitted student from Pleasanton, Calif., referring to a link to the group chat.
“What I read on the Facebook page suggests these posts were pretty offensive, I kind of expected Harvard to be more accepting and less offensive,” Wang, who was not on the group message, said.
Wang, New York City admit Michael J. Won, and Ellen Y. Li and Beverly Ge—both admitted students from Gainesville, Fla.—said they saw the message from Khurana and Dingman, but were not involved in the GroupMe in question.
Still, the students expressed concern about the controversial messages. “I was pretty surprised that would have happened, especially at Harvard,” Wang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although this week’s gray skies and snow do not attest, spring weather is fast approaching—and with it, Yardfest, the College’s annual outdoors concert.
Weeks away, however, the event scheduled for April 24 is still without a headliner, and the College Events Board has not set a date to announce the artist.
“We're still in the phase of contract negotiations,” Yardfest Co-Chair Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We don’t have an exact date,” he added, referring to when the board will announce the artist.
In past years, announcements have typically come in early March.
Last year, British pop artist Jessie J was declared as the headliner with an online announcement featuring a compilation of Jessie J video clips set to one the artist’s most popular songs, “Bang Bang,” on March 25, 2015.
Similarly, the CEB announced R&B and soul artist Janelle Monáe’s appearance the year before in a video on March 13, 2014.
Despite the ongoing negotiations, however, Robertson insisted there is no reason for concern.
“Some contracts just take longer than others,” he explained, adding that the announcement will come “soon.”
Indeed, the upcoming announcement will be the result of months of planning, which began last October with a pair of meetings between the selection committee and students to start formulating a list of potential headliners. The CEB later circulated A Qualtrics poll, asking for student preferences on the choice of the artist.
From there, Robertson wrote that narrowing down the list consisted of making sure the artist was in line with the CEB’s mission to “create an inclusive event for all undergraduates,” as well as “maximizing the value of the artist for our budget.”
The CEB originally planned to announce the headliner before Friday’s Battle for Yardfest, a competition to declare student group openers at Yardfest, so that student artists would “know who they’re competing to play before at Yardfest,” Roberts wrote.
Nevertheless, five prospective student bands and one musician competed to open for the unknown artist in front of a crowded Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub.
“It’s kind of weird,” Scott W. Peters ’16, a member of the band Protein Shake, said. The student group, along with the band the Lighthouse Keepers, will open at Yardfest after winning by popular vote at Battle for Yardfest.
“It doesn’t really matter who it is to us though,” Peters said. “It’ll be a really cool experience to open for an established, professional musician regardless. So we’re looking forward to the announcement, to see who it is.”

Last September, 74 members of the Class of 2019 declared candidacy for the 12 freshman seats on the Undergraduate Council with varying platforms. One promised to bring Beyoncé to Yardfest, one made a commitment to “squashing the cockroach problem” in Grays, and two promised to “Make Harvard Great Again.”
Yet freshman candidates repeatedly mentioned one specific proposal  during the campaign: improving freshman laundry services.
When the 12 freshmen representatives were elected, they began work on a proposal to install a laundry room in Matthews Hall, according to Elm Yard representative Ashri S. Anurudran ’19. Anurudran said that from the outset, the proposal was a hard selling point.
“A lot of upperclassmen and administrators said ‘that’s not going to happen,’” Ivy Yard representative Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said. According to Elm Yard representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19, several administrators said the project would take several years to complete.
Yet by February, the UC announced that construction on a new laundry room in Matthews Hall would begin this summer, with the new machines ready for the incoming members of the Class of 2020.
“It’s probably the most permanent change that we’ve left behind,” Oak Yard representative Olu Oisaghie ’19 said.
After six months in office, many freshman representatives said that despite cynicism from the student body about the UC’s efficacy, the work of the freshmen on the Council has helped to change students’ perception of the body. From expanded printing to revamped brain break, freshman UC representatives hope small projects will leave a lasting effect on the first year experience.
TAKING THE FLOOR
When the 12 freshmen representatives attended their first UC meeting on Sept. 20, most already had prior student government experience. Five of the 12 had served as their high school’s student body president.
Elm Yard representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19, who served on his high school’s student government, said he began participating in order to work on proposals to improve student life.
“For any place you love, you have to look into how to make it better, you have to critique it,” Agbafe said.
Yet even for many representatives with prior student government experience, the UC proved to be a new experience.
“Student government here is much different than it was for me in high school,” Crimson Yard representative Leah D. Stewart ’19 said. “We make more work on institutional changes.”
Bonsall, who served as his high school’s class president, said the UC has more power to “make a difference,” in contrast to his role in his high school’s student government, which he called a “powerless position.”
Still, other representatives said the UC does not hold as much power as they had anticipated.
“You can never really do as much as you expect,” Oisaghie said.
Some found the Council’s system of parliamentary procedure, which last year’s UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 called “tedious in practice,” to be a source of inefficiency. Many freshmen representatives described a steep learning curve for understanding the procedures that dictate virtually every action at the UC’s general meetings.
“At times, I think it does get bogged down by parliamentary procedure,” Oak Yard representative Alex Popovski ’19 said. “There’s a lot of obstacles to making change happen on campus.”
The most recent freshman to join the Council, Oak Yard representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, said that after being elected during the mid-term elections in February, he struggled to adjust to the many people, rules, and acronyms that UC representatives are expected to know.
“Just being the new guy is a little bit of a challenge… I’m happy to say that people were very welcoming,” Boucher said.
NEW BUSINESS
Much of the work done by the freshmen representatives on the Council takes place in the Freshman Class Committee, one of the seven committees on the UC. The committee consists of the 12 freshmen representatives plus its sophomore chair Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18.
Although the committee has worked on a number of freshman-oriented initiatives, some proposals have not made it past the drawing board. Freshmen representatives said they quickly learned that the realistic pace for change at Harvard was slower than they anticipated and that students were not always supportive of their initiatives.
Several freshmen representatives highlighted the installation of printers in all of the freshman dorm buildings as a major accomplishment. Prior to this academic year, more than a third of freshman dorm buildings did not have printers, according to Ivy Yard representative Scott Xiao ’19.
“People had to walk across the yard just to print out a paper, or had to spend money on a printer to put in their dorm,” Bonsall said.
After discussions with Harvard University Information Technology and Harvard Yard Operations, the committee managed to secure seven additional printers for freshman dorms in December.
Over the course of their terms, committee members have also completed initiatives to extend “brain break” hours and offerings, put music stands in all music practice rooms, and install additional game tables in several freshman dorm buildings.
Some freshmen on the UC have also been involved in internal changes within the Council. Crimson Yard representative Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 is a founding member of both the black caucus and the queer caucus on the UC. Created this year, the informal groups meet to address community-specific issues.
“It’s adding legitimacy to the communities that haven’t been as heard as they could have been,” Whittaker said.
Boucher is a founding member of the UC Digital Commission, a group within the Council tasked with developing technical projects to improve the effectiveness of UC initiatives. The group is currently working on creating a text-message based method for student organizations to submitted completed project forms to the Council’s Finance Committee.
Not all of the committee’s initiatives though have been as successful. Many committee members pushed for a UC referendum to convert Pusey Library into a “freshmen-oriented social space.” The referendum appeared on last November’s presidential election ballot and failed to pass, with 56 percent of voters opposing the measure.
“The way the FCC and the UC communicated the referendum could have been a lot better,” Xiao said. “A lot of people didn’t understand what issues we were trying to address.”
Anurudran also said that several representatives have talked with administrators about a proposal that would allow students to use BoardPlus funds on printing and laundry services. After meeting with administrators, Anurudran said the freshman committee has reached a roadblock.
“Sometimes a lot of us have a lot of big ideas and we want to make a lot of changes… once you get to a certain level, you need Harvard administration to get it passed,” Anurudran said.
The committee members also don’t always agree on policy among themselves. Last week, the committee considered a proposal to allocate $850 in funds for berries for a freshman brain break. A third of the committee opposed the measure, with Crimson Yard representative Jack Kelley ’19 saying that it was “not an efficient spending of our money.”
UNANIMOUS CONSENT
All 12 freshmen representatives overwhelmingly agreed their experience on the Council has been positive. Several, however, noted that many of the students they represent have expressed apathy and cynicism towards the UC.
“People always joke about the UC not having that much power and everything, and I definitely understand where that comes from,” Stewart said.
 “I’m not going to lie: we’re not an organization with the most amount of power,” Ivy Yard representative Dennis K. Kim ’19 said. “But I believe that… we can create a lot of small changes that can really improve the quality of student life here.”
Still, multiple representatives said they think the committee’s work this year has improved the public perception of the UC in the eyes of students.
“It’s changed perception among the current freshmen and sophomores about what the UC is and what it can do,” Bonsall said.
“It’s been a delight working with the first-year members of the UC,” Freshman Dean’s Office Department Administrator Brandon Edwards wrote in an email. “They’ve done a tremendous job this year of taking initiative.”
Most representatives said that they intend to run for re-election next fall. However, not all will be able to continue as elected representatives. Two representatives were assigned to Adams House on Housing Day, which will have only one open spot up for re-election in the fall.
In the remaining weeks that the Council is in session, the freshmen representatives said that they plan to work on a variety of projects, including addressing printing and laundry affordability, as well as working with HUIT to make PaperCut, the software that connects student computers to campus printers, easier to use.
The Freshman Class Committee’s latest initiative, the Freshman Health Project, is a week-long program focused on addressing freshman physical fitness, mental health, and sexual health. The project features a variety of events, including yoga, panels, and a petting zoo. The project began Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prospective students who converged on the Law School’s campus last weekend found themselves in the midst of protests and a new financial justice campaign by activists.
About 240 students arrived at the Law School on Friday for Admitted Students Weekend, an annual event meant to showcase the school and persuade students to attend. This Admitted Students Weekend, however, fell at a particularly turbulent time for the school.
Students with the group Reclaim Harvard Law, who have been advocating for better treatment of minorities at the school since the fall, intensified their efforts. Meanwhile, a dispute between activists and opposing students over posters and free speech escalated publicly on Friday.
Members of Reclaim Harvard Law have been occupying the Caspersen Center Student Lounge—which they call “Belinda Hall”—since February. Admitted students sitting in the lounge Friday witnessed the climax of the week-long poster controversy, when activists confronted critic William H. Barlow as he mounted signs on the walls accusing them of censorship.
As the debate continued, activists used posters as a tactic to get the attention of admitted students with the aim of informing them about problems they perceive at the school. Reclaim Harvard Law member Bianca S. Tylek said activists posted 400 signs around the school, in addition to a large banner outside of the room where Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow addressed admitted students. In accordance with an updated poster policy, all posters outside of the lounge were removed, but posters within the lounge remained.
Several admitted students in the lounge Friday expressed mixed feelings about the racial climate at the school. Paul Maneri said witnessing the activism has prompted him to consider whether racial problems at Harvard are worse than those at other schools, or whether they simply receive more attention.
Admitted student Katrina Doyle said she had not heard about activism at the school until she arrived on campus for the weekend. “I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into the student center and I saw all these posters with these rabble-rousing statements,” she said.
As part of their efforts to reach admitted students, activists also put up posters to launch their new financial justice campaign, “Fees Must Fall,” which is focused on lowering tuition for students and improving benefits for staff. The posters cited tuition figures before bold letters reading “Is it worth it?” Reclaim Harvard Law members also passed out fliers to admitted students during a Student Financial Services session.
“The Fees Must Fall campaign is a start of a conversation around financial justice that we believe that Harvard Law School should be engaging in,” Reclaim Harvard Law member Sam S. Koplewicz said. “It’s not just about fees; it’s also about wages for workers and healthcare for workers, and about how we invest our money. Those things cut across both financial discrepancies and racial discrepancies.”
Koplewicz said financial aid and the Low Income Protection Plan—a program that helps graduates who opt for careers in public service with loan repayment—are not enough to alleviate the financial burden that comes with attending the Law School. Activists are concerned that this burden deters disadvantaged students from attending in the first place, and propels students who do attend toward high-paying careers in corporate law.
Tuition for the 2016-2017 academic year will be $59,500, up from $57,200 this year. The school estimates total costs—including projections for room and board, books, and fees—to be $88,600 next year.
Jessica L. Soban, Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer, wrote in an email that the school has never attempted to obscure any information about costs of attendance; rather, the Student Financial Services session was intended to provide clear information to prospective students so that they can each make an informed decision. Soban said that Harvard is one of the few Law Schools that offers 100 percent need-based aid, and that the Low Income Protection Plan has grown substantially over the past 10 years.
“While the amount of debt assumed by graduates at all law schools is high and continues to rise, incomes available to HLS graduates in the legal profession more than justify this investment over the course of a career,” Soban wrote.
Tylek said the decision to attend the Law School is an individual choice, and activists were not attempting to sway prospective students in either direction. In fact, Tylek speculated, witnessing Reclaim Harvard Law in action might make students look favorably on the school.
Doyle falls into this category. “If anything, seeing that there’s other students who notice those things and are doing something about it makes me want to go to Harvard versus another school,” Doyle said. “It shows me that there are people trying to change things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two new proposals for course timetables ahead of the construction of a new campus in Allston could do away with the “endearing” and idiosyncratic features of the Harvard undergraduate schedule.
At Tuesday’s monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris will give a presentation summarizing the work of a task force charged with suggesting course scheduling changes in anticipation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s move to Allston in 2020.
According to a five-page memorandum distributed to faculty and obtained by The Crimson, Harris is scheduled to present two proposals, both of which would increase the passing time between classes within Cambridge and accommodate travel between Cambridge and Allston. The proposals both suggest doing away with “Harvard time”—the seven minute period grace period after a course is scheduled to begin.
In the memo, Harris recommended the pass time within the Cambridge campus be 15 minutes. Scheduling travel between Allston and Cambridge, Harris wrote, “is more complicated.” One proposal  would stagger courses across the two campuses such that students have 45 minutes to traverse from Cambridge to Allston and 75 minutes for the return trip; the other proposal leaves an hour of passing time in both directions.
“Students report that the very existence of what they call ‘Harvard time’ detracts from the sense of seriousness surrounding academics. Anecdotes aside, with a much larger campus it is simply unfeasible to continue with either the official five minutes of pass time or the unofficial seven minutes of pass time,” Harris wrote. “When one adds the expansion of the FAS into Allston, the need for re-thinking pass times becomes indisputably necessary.”
One of the proposals also allows for the “de-compression of the instructional week,” while the other “largely accommodates the current practice of limited Friday instruction.”
The memo also notes that central to the success of both proposals is a “proper regulatory regime that does away with ‘non-compliant times’ and other endearing and unique features of ‘Harvard time.’” To this end, the memo suggests limiting the number of courses a department can schedule during any time slot, thus spreading courses over the day and across the academic week.
“It is only through such a regulatory regime that we will succeed in our goals of de-compressing the instructional day and week, and restoring academics as the central focus of our students’ experience of time,” the memo reads. “Indeed, it is only through such a regime that, a century after the Faculty expressed this aspiration, we might finally achieve ‘profitable rearrangement of the hours of College courses.’”
Administrators have discussed comparable changes to the academic schedule since the task force was first convened in 2013.
On Tuesday, Faculty members also will vote on a merger between the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies and the Standing Committee on the Ph.D. in Film and Visual Studies, according to a meeting agenda obtained by The Crimson.
Under the proposed merger, first presented at last month’s Faculty meeting, the standing committee would be dissolved and VES would offer a doctoral program in Film and Visual Studies, a first for the 50-year-old, undergraduate-only department. Non-VES faculty on the committee would be offered affiliate status in the department, allowing them to advise graduate students and teach classes in the program, serve on exam and dissertation committees, and sit on a new Film and Visual Studies Graduate Committee. A Director of Graduate Studies would replace the former FVS chair.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While softball's Taylor Cabe claimed this week's Athlete of the Week honor, she wasn't the only Crimson athlete to record strong performances this week. Sophomores Datlon Youngblood, of women's rugby, and Julia Glynn, of women's lacrosse, are this week's Athlete of the Week runners up.
DALTON YOUNGBLOOD
The Dallas, TX native was a major contributor for the Crimson all throughout the day in Hamden, CT at the Quinnipiac University Rugby Field. In their first game of the day the team suffered a loss to American International College Yellow Jackets, 7-10.
However, with the help of Youngblood, the team earned victories against the Army Black Knights and Norwich’s B team, with final scores of 25-5 and 22-0, respectively. Youngblood scored a total 4 tries in the two contests.
Youngblood scored 6 tries in total during the tournament. Youngblood is among the many underclassmen that have been major contributors to the Crimson women’s rugby team, as the underclassmen were responsible for 12 of the 14 scores on the day.
JULIA GLYNN
The Crimson women’s lacrosse team, despite the tough loss against No.10/11 Princeton, came out hot against the Dartmouth Big Green. Harvard won its second conference game of the season with a dominating performance.
Midfielder Julia Glynn was responsible for 10 of the Crimson’s 17 scores in Saturday’s game at Harvard Stadium, either by netting a goal herself or notching an assist for one of her teammates. Glynn’s career-high 10 points in the contest against Dartmouth gave her the most points on the team this season with a total of 32.  The midfielder slightly edges out junior Marisa Romeo who has 30 points on the season.
The first six scores for Harvard in Saturday’s matchup were either scored by or assisted by Glynn. As the whistle sounded for the end of the first half, Harvard had an 8-3 lead over the Big Green. The Crimson would continue to roll as it scored nine more times in the second half, the sophomore being responsible for four of them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As Harvard softball begins its Ivy League slate, the team finds itself jostling for position within the league, tied with four other teams with a 2-2 record. One factor in the Crimson’s potential rise to the top of the league will be continued dominance on the mound by junior righthander Taylor Cabe.
Taking the mound two straight days over the weekend, Cabe first carved up Cornell’s lineup in a convincing 9-1 win and then shut out Princeton to allow Harvard to escape with a 1-0 victory.
The two wins marked her seventh and eighth of the season out of 12 total victories for the softball team. Cabe’s recent outings in the circle have carried the team even when the offense has struggled to find a groove.
“She has a really great presence on the mound that our team can kind of rally behind,” senior catcher Rachel Halperin said. “Everyone felt very confident with her out there. She did a great job.”
Following a close loss to Cornell, 8-6, in the first game of a doubleheader, Cabe got the nod from coach Jenny Allard for round two and went the distance for Harvard. In seven innings of work, the junior allowed just one Big Red  runner to cross the plate.
Cornell’s first four innings at the plate passed by quickly, as Cabe did not allow a single runner to reachbase. Although she lost the perfect game and the shutout in the bottom of the fifth, her performance was more than enough to earn the win due to the Crimson’s nine-run offensive barrage.
Despite only striking out one Cornell batter, Cabe kept the opposition off the bases all game. The Big Red could only muster five hits and one walk in seven innings.
After scoring 15 runs in its doubleheader with Cornell, Harvard’s offense disappeared against Princeton on Saturday. However, Cabe’s brilliance on the mound in her second start of the weekend helped Harvard squeak by the Tigers, 1-0.
“Taylor Cabe threw very well for us in the circle all weekend but really stepped up in that second game,” Allard said.
Cabe pitched all seven innings for the second straight day, and once again surrendered only five hits. She stifled the Tigers’ offense even more so than she did the Big Red’s—Princeton did not draw a base on balls and struck out seven times. The Tigers did not have any extra-base hits in the shutout.
A home run off the bat of sophomore Maddy Kaplan in the fourth inning was the difference between Harvard and Princeton entering the bottom of the seventh, and Cabe only needed three outs to clinch the win for the Crimson.
However, Princeton began to threaten when freshman Keeley Walsh led off the frame with a single down the third base line. Later in the inning, Princeton sophomore Kylee Pierce added another base hit, but Cabe prevented both runners from scoring by striking out the side.
“They got the leadoff batter on, and she just really buckled down. . . and had a huge strikeout to end the game,” Allard said.
Cabe’s ERA now sits at 2.85 for the season, good for fifth in the Ivy League. She and co-captain Morgan Groom, who sits close behind at sixth in the league with a 3.15 ERA, have anchored the Harvard pitching staff, making up for the all-freshmen bullpen experiencing some growing pains.
Following a sophomore campaign in which she posted a 4.12 ERA, the Boiling Springs, S.C. native has made some adjustments and is emerging into an ace in the Ivy League.
“I feel like she’s having a strong year, and she really worked on both her technical consistency on her pitches and her mental consistency and mental toughness,” Allard said.
Over the course of her Harvard career, Cabe has won 21 games and closed out four. This year, and this week especially, Cabe has continued to build on her success in both the rotation and the  bullpen.
“I think she’s really hitting her stride physically and mentally this year, and it’s been really good to see from her,” Allard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the road against Cornell (4-16, 1-3 Ivy) and Princeton (7-19, 1-2) in its first Ivy League action of the season, Harvard softball (12-13, 2-2) was unable to capitalize on facing off against the two Ancient Eight teams with the lowest overall records.
Two dominant starts from junior Taylor Cabe carried the Crimson to its two victories of the weekend, one each against the Tigers and the Big Red. Harvard scored 15 combined runs against Cornell while only managing to touch home once against Princeton.
“I think this weekend was a bit frustrating,” senior catcher Rachel Halperin said. “Our team definitely showed up in some moments and really showed that we can dominate a lot of Ivy League teams, but there’s going to be very good competition this year.”
Harvard 1, Princeton 0
In the back end of Saturday’s doubleheader, a fourth-inning Maddy Kaplan home run proved to be the difference maker.
Through three scoreless innings, it was clear that for the second straight game, a pitcher’s duel was brewing. This time, Cabe and Princeton sophomore Ashley La Guardia took turns setting down the opposing team’s batters one after another.
Kaplan broke the tie when she parked the ball over the center-field fence to give the Crimson a one-run advantage.
One run was all the Harvard offense needed to get the job done, as Cabe cruised through the rest of her outing, a dominant complete-game shutout. The junior limited the Tigers to five hits, all of which were singles, and punched out seven, a season best.
Princeton 2, Harvard 0
Despite out-hitting Princeton in the first matchup on Saturday, the Crimson was unable to produce any run support for co-captain Morgan Groom in the circle. Six of the seven Harvard runners stranded in the game were left in scoring position.
“I felt that Morgan Groom really did a wonderful job on the mound,” coach Jenny Allard said. “Princeton’s a tough team, and she really bounced back from a tough start against Cornell.”
Down two runs, the Crimson loaded the bases in a last-ditch effort in the top of the seventh. Freshman Meagan Lantz hit a rope right back up the middle, only to watch Princeton junior second baseman Haley Hineman leap, make the grab, and double off the runner at first to seal the win.
“It was a phenomenal defensive play, so there’s nothing more we could have asked of Meagan Lantz in that situation,” Allard said. “We just needed to put more pressure on them offensively earlier in the game, and we didn’t do that.”
Harvard 9, Cornell 1
Cabe dominated Cornell in Friday’s second game, registering a complete game, one-run performance.
Perfect through four full innings, the righthander took the mound in the fifth looking to continue shutting down the Big Red offense. Perfection would not be long-lived, however, as Cornell sophomore Megan Murray promptly led off with a double into the left-center gap and later scored on a sacrifice fly.
Despite the slight blemish to her pitching line, Cabe still turned in a dominant performance in the circle, earning her seventh win of the year. The junior threw two-thirds of her pitches for strikes and walked just one batter.
The ball was in play almost every at bat on both sides. Each team only struck out once, and Cornell junior Olivia May worked the game’s lone walk.
Cornell 8, Harvard 6
In its first Ivy action, Harvard dropped a close decision to Cornell.
Facing a five-run deficit, the Crimson rallied in the top of the fifth and hung a crooked number on the scoreboard. Harvard tied the game in one turn at bat by sending five runners across the plate, three of which scored when Lantz took Cornell starter Meg Parker deep to left field.
Parker eventually settled down, and the Big Red answered with three runs of its own in the next half inning to secure the win.

It’s that time of year again! When you sit down for lunch at the dining hall and all conversations inarguably lead to one daunting question: “So, what are you doing this summer?” Your heart skips a beat and your cheeks turn colored as you stammer to explain why you’re still as lost in the internship search as you were in August.
But, hey, no summer plans yet? Worry not! You are at Harvard for God’s sake! With your impressive academic achievements and surely, extensive extracurricular activities, your resume can manage without a summer internship. After a grueling exam period and demanding semester, there’s honestly no better way to spend the summer than doing absolutely nothing. Trust us, this might be the best thing to happen to you yet!
While all your friends will be pounding through tedious office work day after day, waking up at 7:00 am on the dot, and commuting on the stinky subway, you’ll be living the life: drinking piña coladas poolside, sleeping until noon, and binge watching Netflix! Every overambitious Harvard student’s dream.
Take this well-deserved break to do everything you love (but can’t do during school time because, well, Harvard): actually read for fun, exercise, eat delicious homemade food.
Better yet, try something new: learn to play that instrument you never mastered, take painting lessons, join a sports team, convince yourself that you have talent outside of the classroom. You might even end up writing a book in all that spare time or getting a head start on your thesis!
Use your summer to rekindle old friendships: hang around with your childhood friends, visit your high school teachers (who obviously love you), spend more time with family. Take advantage of these three long months to travel: explore your hometown's hidden gems, take that wild trip you’ve always dreamed of, hike the Grand Canyon.
And if you’re still fixed on working this summer, worry not! There’s still 60 days for you to find the job of your dreams and plenty of opportunities just sitting there on Crimson Careers. Perhaps even consider going to one of the million OCS seminars that crowds your inbox every day...

That’s right, Boston got you again. After a few days of spring weather last week, I think we all expected that the little frost emoji on the weather forecast for Sunday was a joke. I guess the bipolar nature of New England weather can never be underestimated.
It all started with the slow descent to murkiness on Saturday, and by the wind storm on Sunday morning, we all knew that it was over. I hadn’t expected it to snow like it’s December this morning though.
Actually, after three years at a high school in Connecticut, I should be used to the phenomenon known as The-Warmth-That-Never-Comes, the perpetual overcast sky that prolongs from February to May, but I guess it’s clear that I didn’t come out of the dormitory often enough to really understand the struggle.
In fact, I had stored away all my winter clothes and shoes until this morning, when I realized that the temperature had dropped into the minuses (yes, I use Celsius). Slowly pulling open the curtains, and discovering the winter wonderland that had returned, I pulled out my boots from a box under my bed, nearly in tears.
This is exaggeration, of course. The weather isn’t too bad. And I’m sure that spring will come. Next year. But upon experiencing the sun for the first time since October last week, I’d realized that I’d been feeling under the weather. Soaking in the vitamin D and clear blue sky, I felt happiness and motivation to be kinder to others. I did all my readings, I went to the gym, I even introduced myself to a stranger in Annenberg—this was who my mom had raised me to be.
My epiphany has since then disappeared with the sunlight, and I am back to the cliché freshman year identity crisis. What is my next life goal? Have I always been this lazy? Should I go to class or drown in my miseries looking at jean shorts on online shopping sites?
As we wait for the spring that will never come until summer in June, take some vitamin D, guys. It probably doesn’t do anything, but I find that if you convince yourself that it does, it has a slight placebo effect.

On Friday, six student bands—Protein Shake, Obasi-Shaw, Foxpack, Shitzu-Jujitsu, the Lighthouse Keepers, and Catch of the Day—drummed, strummed, and sang it out in the Queen’s Head Pub for the opportunity to open for Yardfest. After a night of music ranging from sultry jazz to spirited alternative rock, the crowd voted The Lighthouse Keepers and Protein Shake as Yardfest 2016’s student openers. The Roving Reporter caught up with a few of the bands after the show.
Cole D. Toner ’16 (drummer, Protein Shake)
Roving Reporter: How do you balance football and music?
Cole Toner: It’s tough. We’ve played with each other since we got to the Quad—there’s a recording studio in the SOCH, so we started jamming there. We loved doing that, and we decided sophomore year, “Hey, we’re going to play Yardfest senior year, we’re going to try it.” We have less of a time commitment for football now, since we’re seniors. Two of us are done, and two of us are just doing the NFL workouts in the morning. It’s a lot of fun.
RR: What kind of music do you like to play most?
CT: We’re mostly just a rock band—a little indie—but we haven’t jammed together for that long. We’ve practiced probably 10 songs and played five here. But we like all types of music; a lot of us are very musically smart guys. I want to say a special shoutout to Scott Peters [’16], our guitarist, who broke a string in the first song and transposed down a key the whole time. Still played every note right. If he wasn’t a genius, we wouldn’t have had a show.
RR: If you could have any professional football player in your band, who would it be?
CT: Andrew Luck. He’s a smart guy [who] appreciates music too. I don’t know if he plays any instruments, but I’m sure he can learn. His personality seems a lot like ours—a little goofy, smart, has a lot of fun.
Daniel L. Winshall (Boston Arts Academy; bassist, Foxpack), Jas H.E. Kayser (Berklee College of Music; drummer, Foxpack)
RR: How did you first meet as a band?Daniel Winshall: Claire Dickson [’19], the lead singer, brought us all together. I met her at summer camp.
Jas Kayser: I did too. The same summer camp, in 2013.
RR: How long have you been playing together?
DW: About a week.
RR: Where do you guys see yourselves going in the future?
DW: Personally, I want to take over the world. First the East Coast, then America. And then maybe Europe.
RR: Any repertoire you really want to explore?
JK: Hip-hop—am I right?
DW: Yeah, it’d be cool if we could get to hip-hop. I feel like Harvard has a hip-hop vibe, but I’m not sure they’re ready, so it’d be cool if we brought it.
RR: If you had the chance to play one dream gig—you could play anywhere—where would it be?
DW: At the end of his life, Miles Davis had a house in Malibu. If I could play a gig at that house in Malibu, after he got together with Cicely Tyson for the second time, I would.
JK: Do I have to pick my own? I can’t beat that.
Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’16 (singer, Shitzu-Jujitsu), Matthew T. Brokaw ’18 (bassist, Shitzu-Jujitsu), Christian D. Carrick ’16 (guitarist, Shitzu-Jujitsu)
RR: How would you guys describe yourselves?
Mark Grozen-Smith: I usually describe [our band] as a combination of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Stevie Wonder.
RR: Are you feeling any stage fright?
MGS: Not really. We’ve played on average one show a week this semester, so that’s helped us settle into not just being onstage but also playing together and making music as a band rather than just individually.
Teddy Brokaw: I get the opposite of stage fright now. We’ll go up there, and I’m in an adrenaline haze. The blood starts pumping, and I just go blank with rock-and-roll. We always perform way better than we sound in rehearsal.
Christian Carrick: We put a lot of time into writing and sharpening our songs, so when we get to perform, we’re so into them, all that goes away.
RR: Do you guys have any pre-performance rituals?
MGS: I stare deeply into Christian’s eyes for two hours before every show.
CC: I’ll do mock guitar solos with my mouth, and that gets me in the right frame of mind.
TB: As the bassist, which has long been understood to be the most important, glamorous position in the band, I’m usually off to the side with my harem of groupies.

Welcome back Flyby Matchmaker!
Alice Xiao ‘18 lives in Pforzheimer House and studies History, Art and Architecture. Ben Betik ‘17 lives in Quincy House and is studying Economics. Both Ben and Alice said that the three things they could not survive without are food, water and air. Ben originally said that living in the Quad would be a deal breaker. But was it? Read on to see if a long distance relationship was born over some Boloco burritos. We don't have a picture of our happy couple, so this date is going to remain blind to all of us. 
Ben: Alice was there first, which was weird because, for the first time in my life, I was on time.
Alice: I think I got there at six exactly. It was raining.
Ben: There was a whole drama of my umbrella not closing… so everyone in the room turned and looked at me and I didn’t know which of [them] I should be talking to… Eventually everyone else turned away… and then Alice was standing there. I didn’t [recognize] her. That was [a] plus because it [meant it] was an actual blind date.
Alice: He looked nice.
Ben: I tend to try not to judge people on their looks or whatever… [but] I mean she’s cute so that helps.
Alice: [I got a burrito] and a smoothie too.
Ben: Burritos are great, but burritos may not be the best blind date choice… there is no graceful way to eat a burrito… I should have gone for the bowl; would have been a much better call.
Alice: [Initially] we talked about basic stuff like class, concentration what you do on campus and I found out that he did a lot of model UN, which was cool because I do international relations stuff on campus too.
Ben: It took a while to get into conversation. [With] some people it’s easy, you walk into the energy and you know you have the chemistry.
Alice: The beginning was a little bit awkward. The getting to know you part in general… [but] I wouldn’t say that it was that difficult [to find things to talk about]. He was a pleasant person…
Ben: There are the four things you aren’t supposed to talk about on first dates… politics, religion, abortion, [and] economics. So we talked about politics… that was something really interesting. She’s a Hillary supporter. I’m kind of on the fence between Hillary and Bernie so we just had a really engaging conversation about politics. Everyone can bond over how awful of a person Donald Trump is so that really brought us together.
Alice: [Politics] were a good part of our conversation because I told him honestly how I felt about it... It wasn’t like we were trying to impress someone.
Ben: I wouldn’t say Alice and I had instant chemistry…[but] I’d be interested in hanging out with [her] again. In fact, I did invite her to a dinner party thing.
Alice: He invited me [to a biweekly dinner his roommates put on] and I thought it seemed like a fun idea. I’m going on Friday.
Given Datamatch was in full swing just weeks before that the two met, we had to ask about our competition:
Ben: Yes, I did [Datamatch]. I was seven people’s top match so apparently I’m really mathematically popular… I’m just getting all kinds of free food. It’s amazing. I think I’ve eaten in a dhall twice this week and haven’t had to pay at all.
Alice: I did Datamatch too. I actually had a Datamatch date this morning. [But] I would recommend actually being set up on a blind date, like going with Flyby, because it’s more exciting to not know [who your date will be]… it’s more spontaneous; it’s more… exciting... I don’t see why more people aren’t doing it.
Ben: I would [recommend this] to my best friends and my worst enemies… What I’ve learned from this is that blind dates are really weird and they are weird for everyone. So if you’re having a weird time don’t worry the other person is having just as weird a time… I’d be down to do another blind date just because I think it’s fun and kind of funny after the fact.

Get ready for the best news (and if this doesn’t qualify as the best news of your week, we can’t be friends) of this week, folks: the new Clover opened its doors for lunch today! That’s right, the beloved Clover that used to be on Holyoke Street moved about 60 feet to Mass Ave (where Yenching used to be) in anticipation of Smith Campus Center construction. As a die-hard Clover fan, I felt as if it was my civic duty to be there for its opening– in fact, I am not ashamed to admit that I was on line to order a Shiitake Mushroom sandwich by 1:05 p.m. for their 1 p.m. opening.
I am here to tell you that you will fall in love with the new Clover. Believe me, I’ve spent a lot of time (and consequently money, sorry Mom and Dad) at the Clover on Holyoke Street. The sterile white walls, the laboratory aesthetic, the two floors of seating, and the all-encompassing smell of chickpea fritters are all things I’ve grown to love about the Clover at 7 Holyoke. The new Clover is really different, except for the all-encompassing smell of chickpea fritters, that is.
For starters, the new Clover is much smaller than the old one. It’s more like a wide hallway and doesn’t have a second floor, but it’s really quaint. It also offers a lot of seating options: you can sit at the wooden communal table in the middle, in individual seats looking out at Mass Ave, cute little booths with no view, or booths at the back with a view of Holyoke Street. The new Clover also has immensely cool historical walls featuring pennants of different schools and a lot of Crimson H’s. Upon doing some further research into this, I found on Clover’s blog that their contractor discovered these walls while doing demolition work. They date back to 1913 and belonged to a place called Waldorf Lunch, an iconic place to get food in the past.
Despite the new look, the friendliness of the staff and the amazingly yummy vegetarian food of Clover still remain. I had an A+ Shiitake Mushroom sandwich that kept me happy and full for the rest of my long Tuesday. All in all, coming from an unashamedly biased perspective, the new Clover is great. Perhaps the only problem is that with its new location on Mass Ave making it that much closer to my classes, I will never eat HUDS lunch again and thus will be eternally broke.

If you’re like us at Flyby and are dependent on coffee on get through your day, you’re probably aware that what HUDS calls coffee is...less than ideal. Thankfully, HUDS is looking to change its supplier for next year, and held a taste testing event in the Queen’s Head today to get student input. Since we’re never ones to turn down free food, we at Flyby dropped by to sample the different coffee brands that could be potential replacements to our current selection of Seattle’s Best.
First of all, props to Harvard for actually taking student input, especially for an important decision regarding everyone’s favorite thing to complain about: HUDS. I personally think that HUDS has improved markedly in recent months, and actually boasts some amazing dishes and desserts. But nevertheless, the opportunity to have something new to complain about in our dining hall is great.
There were four options for students to try: Peet’s, Pierce Bros. Coffee, Sun Coffee Roasters, and our current company, Seattle’s Best Coffee. The Sun Coffee Roasters guys had a complicated-looking setup (think Clover’s coffee) that didn’t seem completely translatable to the dining hall. It did look cool and hipster, though, and if chosen might better allow students to pretend like they know what good coffee tastes like. Both Sun Coffee and Pierce Bros seemed to emphasize fair trade and making a difference in their production methods, which is admirable.
Seattle’s Best offered extra treats and the most corporate looking display, probably to try and draw in students who clearly hate their coffee enough to demand a change. It seemed like this fooled no one, though, and the stand was least busy among the options. Probably because most of us know Seattle’s Best as the only-slightly-edible caffeine source that we all begrudgingly use to get through our day.
Frankly, I can’t say that I have the coffee palette that can actually tell the difference between most types of coffee, but I really appreciated people telling me about different notes and flavors while I sipped slowly and nodded in agreement. I’m partial to Peet’s, so that’s who Flyby is going to declare as the winner of this battle. Their coffee was the least bitter to my unrefined taste-buds, and the fact that they have two stores within seconds of each other in the Square (look out, The Harvard Shop) suggest they’re a crowd favorite, too. Stay tuned, though, for what the Harvard population ends up deciding—results should be released in the next few weeks.
