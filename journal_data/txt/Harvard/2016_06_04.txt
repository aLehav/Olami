Harvard’s campus is normally filled with distinguished academics. This year, though, we were blessed with a seemingly sudden outpour of Hollywood superstars. Steven Spielberg as Commencement speaker, Rashida Jones at Class Day. And then to have Carrie Fisher, Princess Leia herself,  stroll casually through campus was a truly jaw dropping, oh-my-god-facebook-look-at-how-cool-my-school-is moment. The litany of A-listers continued: Conan O’Brien, Kerry Washington, Joseph Gordon Levitt…
So you would think we Harvard students would have enough to brag about, right? Think again. Channing Tatum—yes, the Channing Tatum, who almost never sports a shirt on the big screen—enrolled in an executive education course about entertainment, media, and sports at Harvard Business School.
Cue the fangirling and ready the iPhone cameras. Some grade-A selfie opportunities are on the horizon. Heck, even his professor couldn’t resist bragging about hooking and reeling in the Hollywood star. Business School professor Anita Elberse, head of the course, tweeted out from her account (@anitaelberse) “So yeah, this is happening. Four legends signed up to take my ExecEd course." Only at @HarvardHBS! #HBSExecEd” 
Joining Tatum in the course is L.L Cool J, and NBA stars Pau Gasol and Chris Paul. If Harvard College students could cross-register into the class, you’d bet Elberse’s course enrollment would dwarf even the likes of Mankiw and Malan.
