After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late one night, seized by a fit of temporary insanity, I decided to play “Farmville.”
I’d heard of the game, of course—I, like everyone else, received a half-jillion little notifications about it on Facebook before I finally blocked the application. And I’d made fun of it quite a bit: a game that revolves around maintaining a farm seems, well, about as fun as maintaining a farm.
But I was curious. The game has millions of players, and the company that makes the game, Zynga, is worth billions. Surely there’s got to be an interesting game there, right?
“It’ll be fine,” I told myself. “Just make sure you don’t send any requests to anyone, and no one will ever know.” I took a surreptitious look around the room, then began typing in the address, and clicked the ‘Play’ button.
Thing is, no one ever told me Farmville has music.
Within seconds the banjo notes were blaring out of my computer, and every person in the room turned to stare at me.
“Julie, what was that?” a friend asked.
“Nothing! And definitely not ‘Farmville!’ Because that’s totally lame!”
Yeah. I’m not a very good liar.
My cover blown, I still decided go ahead with the “Farmville” experiment. As soon as I finally found a button to mute that terrible music, I eagerly plowed all the land on my farm and sowed as many seeds as I could afford.
“Awesome, now I’m all set up!” I thought. Then I started clicking around, looking to see what else there was to do. Was there maybe a cutesy farming village to visit? Nope. Maybe there was some sort of mini-game, like a puzzle or a race or something? Nope. Maybe I was just overlooking something?
Nope. It seemed I was back to option one. And option one was, quite literally, “Watching Grass Grow.”
Of course, you’re not supposed to actually watch it. You’re supposed to go away and then come back a few hours later to harvest it. Then you repeat. And after you do this enough times, you can get more money, so you can get more crops, so you can get even more money, so you can grow more crops. But you’re still playing a game whose entire point is to watch grass grow.
Let’s review our choices here. We live in a time where you can pick up a video games that will let you: become a Renaissance-era assassin; steal cars and dodge cops; hurl birds through flimsy fortresses; fend for your life in a zombie apocalypse; save the world in dozens of different sci-fi and fantasy scenarios; and become a rockstar. And yet one of the most popular games of all time, a game with over 30 million players, revolves around watching grass grow.
To be fair, there is one other major component to “Farmville:” spamming your friends. I wasn’t able to walk three steps around my farm without the cutesy little pop-ups assailing me, insisting that I notify others about my flourishing crops, demanding I let everyone know that I’m now a “Level 8 Farmer”—whatever that’s supposed to mean—and so on. My personal favorite: “Fertilized crops grow faster! Share this knowledge with your friends?”
Evidently Farmville thinks my friends aren’t smart enough to know that fertilizer fertilizes. I’m not sure how the messages could get much more banal—unless there’s a “Breathing helps you stay alive! Share this knowledge with your friends?” pop-up I haven’t yet discovered.
Adding insult to injury, there’s quite a bit of lazy game design going on. For example: when you click on things on your farm, a little scythe icon appears and the game announces you are “harvesting.” This makes sense for spinach and apples. But why does the game insist on holding a scythe to my cow’s throat whenever I just want to milk it? I was always scared I was going to slaughter the poor thing.
Also, for an extra dash of political incorrectness: not only can you buy, use, and sell seeds; you can also buy, use, and sell farmhands. Wait, what? I thought this was “Farmville,” not “Pre-Civil War Plantationville.”
Still, I continued to play “Farmville” for another week or two, out of sheer confusion: why, oh why, is this game so popular? I kept waiting for a ravenous farming instinct to kick in, compelling me to check in on my crops at all hours of the night. I kept waiting for the gameplay to feel less like waiting on a stopwatch and more like an actual game. But in the end, it all still felt like watching grass grow. And watching grass grow, I guess, just isn’t my thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I first noticed a split between my mom’s taste in literature and my own at the beginning of ninth grade. One of the first things we read in my English class was a short story by Fay Weldon about a woman who committed suicide without warning, though she seemed to be a perfect wife and mother. It was compressed, smart, descriptive, and rich; I thought it was brilliant.
I had just finished reading it on a rainy afternoon when I was overcome with the urge to share this story, which, I was convinced at the time, was the best thing ever. “Mom,” I said enthusiastically, “you have to read this.” I remember waiting for her reaction as she made her way through the three or four pages of the story, the same way that you wait for someone to listen to your favorite new CD or to taste the cookies you just made. I was almost heartbroken when she handed it back to me and said, “it’s very literature-y. Kind of depressing.” Well, yes, it was depressing, but it was also great. Why didn’t she like it?
That was the start of a split between my mom and me—or, rather, our reading material—that we haven’t been able to reconcile since. As I delved into Faulkner and Dickens, she stuck with Marian Keyes and Dean Koontz. In large part it was difficult because I had always thought of Mom as my reading buddy. At that time, we were the main readers of the household. It was my mom who had seen me all the way from Dr. Seuss’ “Green Eggs and Ham” to Michael Crichton. It was my mom with whom, in the absence of like-minded company, I could discuss the finer points of anything from “A Wrinkle In Time” to “October Sky.” She was part book club and part mentor.
We’d had plenty of experiences reading the same books. There was the winter when we both read “The Swiss Family Robinson,” cross-referencing our separate editions because the numbering of the chapters was different. The previous year, in eighth grade, I had read S.E. Hinton’s “The Outsiders,” which was her favorite book when she was my age. That summer, we were in the middle of reading “The Catcher in the Rye,” a book my mom and I both plodded through despite the fact that neither of us liked it very much. Soon after that came the short story incident, when it became clear that we were heading in different directions.
We both knew, without saying anything, that we had entered separate universes. I was never rebellious by any stretch of the imagination, so swapping out Grisham for Faulkner was as close to an adolescent declaration of independence as I ever came. There came a point of distinct, irrevocable separation when I realized that she wasn’t going to follow me along the common path of Dante’s “Inferno” or accompany me through Whitman, just as there had come a point when I realized that she wasn’t going to follow me in to daycare and wasn’t going to help with my algebra homework.
Our differences will inevitably be reflected in what we read; if the books we read illustrate our personalities, it becomes all the more important to read uniquely. But reading together also draws us together into a world where each reader imagines their own unique vision of the book into existence. What you see when you read “Jane Eyre” is different from what I see. Each of our readings is colored by all the experiences that come before it—everything that has ever happened to us to make us distinctive individuals. But collaborative reading is a sympathetic, a democratic act; it unifies many experiences while valuing their distinctness. We coexist in this imaginary world of the book—a coexistence that allows us to understand the differences between our imaginations.
My mom and I have always been close, and that never really changed. We’ve always enjoyed cooking together, talking, listening to National Public Radio. And even as the connection of sharing the same reading started to wane as I started high school, that waning made the occasional book that we have shared since even more meaningful. Rather than having the same points of connection all the time, cherishing a special few makes them all the more worthwhile—makes us appreciate each other not so much for our commonalities as for the remarkably different people that we are. We have plans in the works to read Keith Richards’ autobiography together when I get home. It’s no “Green Eggs and Ham,” mind you, but I’m looking forward to it all the same.

Last Friday and Saturday, Mariachi Véritas de Harvard did not simply draw audience members to listen to their music, but inspired them to join in. Students cheered and sang along to classic mariachi songs—such as José Alfredo Jiménez’s “El Rey”—in a weekend of festivity. Though common in Southwestern states like Texas and California, the Mariachi genre has a much smaller presence in New England. Nonetheless, Mariachi Véritas managed to fill the cinema at the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH) with the spirited sounds of mariachi music, and performed with several prestigious East Coast collegiate ensembles and a high school ensemble from San Marcos, Texas. Founded 10 years ago, Mariachi Véritas has not only grown in reputation and authenticity, but is also taking ambitious strides to increase the prevalence of mariachi music in a place far from its Southwestern roots.
Though Mariachi music is alive and well at Harvard today, members of Mariachi Véritas can recall the ensemble’s humble beginnings. “When we started out, the musicians would wear black pants and polo shirts to a gig. We now have full, traditional mariachi suits,” said Mariachi Véritas president Karl U. Wichorek ’11. Mariachi Véritas vice president Diego Rentería ’11-’12 also notes another distinctive change. “When I started, the Mariachi group here did not memorize their music and played with music stands,” said Rentería. “In reality, in Mariachi performance you have to have your music memorized and [perform while] standing. That tradition has been passed down [so that you] perform [without] anything between you and the audience.” It is these significant gains in authenticity that has contributed to the ensemble’s success.
Mariachi Véritas have performed many times in the past, but have never collaborated as extensively with other ensembles as they did this weekend. One of these groups is Berklee College of Music’s “Mariachi de Berklee.” “[With] Berklee’s mariachi coming in [last Friday] ... the two finest student mariachis on the East coast are performing in one concert, which is really something. Mariachi is definitely something that is very much centered in the Southwestern United States. The fact that we are becoming a hub for this sort of activity in the Northeast, I think adds a new dimension to our concert,” said the ensemble’s music director George W. Zuo ’13. In addition, Mariachi Véritas also performed alongside San Marcos Mariachi Academy’s “Mariachi Bondad” and Brown University’s “Mariachi de Brown,” illuminating the national scope of Mariachi Véritas’ artistic collaboration.
Mariachi Bondad, a high school ensemble from Texas, holds special significance for Mariachi Véritas. “When the group was founded, the goal was to share Mariachi music with the Harvard community and the wider-Boston community—and we’ve definitely done that. But another goal of the group is to act as role models for youth. In that sense, I think it is a great opportunity for [Mariachi Bondad] to see Mariachi music and the cultural heritage outside [of] an area like California and Texas and see it flourish in an area as far as the Northeast,” said Wichorek. However, inviting Mariachi Bondad was not only rewarding for its high school musicians, but also for the Harvard community. “They show [to the Harvard community] that ... there are areas where marching bands and jazz ensembles are ingrained in the high school culture, [but there are also] areas where Mariachi music and other sorts of Mexican or Latino music are a really big part of it—so much that there is an academy and extracurricular high school and cultural groups designed to teach it and promote it,” said Rentería.
Just as it has worked to progress from its humble beginnings, Mariachi Véritas made the most of their humble performance space at SOCH during their concerts on Friday and Saturday. By the end of Saturday night, the hall was alive with cheering and singing, and the concert felt a world away from Harvard’s New England campus. Saturday’s concert was complemented by appearances from ballet folklórico groups from both Harvard College and Dartmouth College with the evening of artistic collaboration exemplified in the final number, “La Negra,” performed by all the ensembles—both mariachi and ballet.
Mariachi Bondad’s performance endeared all with their passion and their impressive technique while Mariachi de Brown, the smallest ensemble of the evening, proved to be the most exuberant of them all. One of their guitarists practically leapt off the ground with excitement and their lead vocalist, Daniel Villalobos, earned a standing ovation with his rich tenor. Mariachi Véritas displayed classical perfection and an earnest love for the music, their musicians shining particularly in “Tu Nombre Me Sabe a Yerba.”
The mariachi art form, unlike many others, is fueled not only by the passion of its musicians but also the audience’s response. “When we play music and we see everyone in the crowd singing along with us, they are all bonding over these songs that everybody knows and they are laughing and yelling and screaming,” said Zuo. “You will never get that in an orchestra. You will never get that in the very traditional modes of expressing music.”

“There was no smooth road leading here,” said legendary jazz composer and tenor sax player Benny Golson as he addressed a packed Sanders Theatre during the culminating performance of the “40 Years of Jazz at Harvard” celebration. The retrospective concert on April 9 retraced the bumpy road to which Golson makes reference—the historical progression of the Office for the Arts at Harvard Jazz Program that began in 1971 with the hiring of the current Director of Harvard University Band, Thomas G. Everett. As challenging as Everett’s work may have been over the last 40 years, Saturday’s concert revealed a thriving Harvard jazz community with a rousing series of historically contrasting pieces and a variety of performers, including current students, an alumnus, and a handful of jazz masters, young and old.
When Everett arrived at Harvard in 1971, he discovered a jazz wasteland. “I didn’t find any jazz above the surface, and in talking to students, few seemed interested or had past experience in it,” he said. Instead of begrudgingly bearing the institutional apathy towards the music that he so revered Everett decided to establish his own jazz band. As the Harvard Jazz Program grew over the years, he began bringing in jazz masters for residencies and master classes on campus. He invited not only band members, but all members of the Harvard community to elicit more exposure to jazz and its affiliates.
At the 40-year mark, Everett has hosted and commissioned an exhaustive list of the highest-caliber jazz artists for residencies and concerts at Harvard. His fledgling group of 1971 has expanded into two full big bands, known as the Sunday and Monday Jazz Bands. Harvard has also gradually developed a number of course offerings pertaining to the study of jazz and its history, many of which are taught by the Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music, Ingrid Monson, currently the Acting Dean for the Arts and Humanities. “I think that all along, jazz has been about excellence in music, really studying hard, and insisting through the excellence of the music that it be taken seriously,” said Monson.
In order to capture the breadth of the Harvard Jazz Program, last weekend’s celebration featured two events outside of Saturday’s concert. The first was a reception last Thursday for the opening of an exhibit in the Loeb Music Library, which displays part of the “The Tom Everett Collection of Jazz Manuscripts.” The collection consists of manuscripts and letters Everett has compiled over the decades from the jazz artists with whom he has worked. The second, a public conversation between Everett and Monson in the Barker Center last Friday, highlighted the richness of Harvard’s jazz history and Everett’s quirky humor as he expounded on the philosophy of jazz, the history of Harvard’s jazz community, and the wit and witticisms of the jazz masters he has hosted.
As the last event in three jazz-jammed days, Saturday’s concert was intended as a summative presentation of how much the Harvard Jazz Program has accomplished during its 40 years. Beginning with the Sunday Jazz Band, directed by Assistant Band Director Mark E. Olson, the concert proved instantly engaging, although it revealed some flaws. The Sunday Jazz Band suffered from a dragging drummer, clashing intonation, and severe sound muddling due to poor engineering in the echo chamber of Sanders Theatre. Although the latter problem persisted when the Monday Jazz Band took the stage, they otherwise sounded consistently controlled. They began with a smooth and nonchalantly reserved rendition of Billy Strayhorn’s classic “Take the ‘A’ Train” and proceeded to the head-scratchingly difficult Charles Mingus piece “The Shoes of The Fisherman’s Wife are Some Jive Ass Slippers,” which contains countless tempo changes, chaotic breakdowns, and searchingly arrhythmic interludes. Despite some transitional messiness, this piece proved to be a highlight of the concert, a shameless display of the Monday Band’s flexibility and bravery.
After an adept though dry vocal performance by Samara R. Oster ’13, the stage began to flood with jazz celebrities, starting with Harvard alum and professional tenor sax player Donald K. Braden ’85 and soon expanding into the “Harvard All-Stars,” which consisted of Benny Golson on tenor saxophone, Brian Lynch on trumpet, Eddie Palmieri on piano, Cecil McBee on bass, and Roy Haynes on drums. This collection of stellar musicians—all of whom have visited Harvard in the past—breezed through tunes ranging across jazz history, moving flawlessly from bebop to the more modern “Blues for Moody.” The performance displayed a tremendously rich spectrum of artists and styles from the young to the old and from the brassy confidence of Lynch to the smoky, labyrinthine lines of Golson. What resulted was a spectacular display of everything the jazz idiom has to offer.
After 40 years, jazz still continues to reverberate throughout the halls of Harvard, and it shows no signs of fading away. “Due to Tom’s efforts,” said Golson, “jazz will go on long after he’s gone, after I’m gone.”

After thirteen years of combining orchestral music with rich theatricality, it was fitting that the Harvard Pops Orchestra reflected on their growth in their latest spring concert, “Pops Comes of Age,” last Saturday in Lowell Lecture Hall. Presented first as an Alumni Reunion Concert for former Pops musicians, the concert featured acclaimed composer and music director Brad Ellis, best known for his role as the pianist on Glee.
“I’m struck at the artfulness [Brad] brings to music making, his craft, his versatility, and the positivity he brings,” Harvard Pops Musical Director Allen G. Feinstein ’86 said of Ellis.
Ellis participated in a Learning From Performers seminar last Wednesday in Adams House LCR, where close friend Feinstein acted as moderator. In a stark contrast to his quiet and reserved character on Glee, Ellis was talkative and engaging; he inserted impromptu piano playing to accent humorous accounts of working with celebrities like Jane Lynch, Billy Joel, and Kristin Chenoweth. Noting Ellis’s surprisingly gregarious character, Harvard Pops Co-President Ivan D. Bochkov ’12 said, “He talks in real life!  We are going to make fun of this a little bit on Saturday.”
Bochkov, Co-President Kenneth C. Hammond ’12, and Pops musicians certainly poked fun at this misconception of Ellis when developing the concept for the concert. They set their performance at the fictional “Harvard Middle School,” where student Leah, played by Natalie S. Feldman ’12, brought new neighbor Gabe, played by Ryan P. Halprin ’12. to join her middle school Pops orchestra.  When evil band concert director Mr. Ratigan, played by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, attempts to take over the orchestra, Leah and Gabe ask the Vice-Principal (Ellis) for help. Ellis responded first in a meek voice, but then cleared his throat and proceeded to sing Irving Berlin’s ragtime “I Love a Piano.”
Noting this creative narrative approach, Hammond said, “we bring in actors and scripts as a way of connecting the songs to the audience and providing more entertainment.”
Intertwined in the plot was a diverse array of songs—highlights from “Wicked,” the theme from “Mission Impossible,” excerpts from “Fiddler on the Roof,” and more. The Pops' rendition of "Fiddler on the Roof" featured a beautiful and intricate solo by Nora K. Ali '11. Ali's performance reminded the audience that despite the evening's playful plot and musical selections, the Pops musicians are not lacking in technical skill. Her rendition received a standing ovation.
As the night’s dramatic journey unfolded, the Harvard Middle School Pops enlisted the help of alumni to trump the wicked Mr. Ratigan. The performance concluded with a flourish as Harvard  College’s real Pops alumni joined the student musicians for the traditional rendition of “Throne Room and End Title” from “Star Wars,” in which they played elementary percussion instruments. However, in full appropriateness, they surprised the audience with an encore—a medley of popular songs from the TV show “Glee” sung by Ortiz and Feldman.
Though the Pops’ dramatic narrative and complementing musical selection did not necessarily align in the most sensible way, it was clear that the goal was light-hearted entertainment. With one silly instrument made of garden tools, a section of the orchestra acting as Asian pirates, and several Harvard-appropriate jokes about Adam Wheeler and Mark Zuckerberg, the show was all in good fun. “I enjoy the vibe of the Harvard Pops and their rife sense of humor,” Ellis said.
One word to sum up this year’s Pops concert? Gleeful.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: APRIL 12, 2011
The April 11 article "Light-hearted Pops Tell Story of Growing Up" misstated the name of the piece featuring Nora K. 'Ali 11. The piece was "Fiddler on the Roof," not "Hoseanna."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cassandra E. Euphrat Weston ’14 still gets nervous every time she performs her poetry. “Especially if what I’ve written isn’t very good,” she adds. “But you have to perform it as if it’s the best thing in the world—and then it will be.”
However, Euphrat Weston also feeds on the fear intrinsic to spoken word. “It’s absolutely terrifying but absolutely addictive,” she says. “You write poems to figure things out—and once you’ve found them, they’re scary.” During Optional Winter Activities Week Euphrat Weston helped to organize a Spoken Word Extravaganza, which drew nearly 200 people to its final performance, and is starting a student organization for spoken word called Speak Out Loud. “We want to encourage everybody to write and perform spoken word,” she says. “Poetry can be a very solitary endeavor but we want to create a completely supportive community of poets and writers.” Though spoken word is finding its place at Harvard, it is largely relegated to the undergraduate body and formally outside the academy. After all, spoken word is a form of expression that has historically turned away from institutions and relied instead on the individual voice, the basement café, and the symbolic portent of the open mic.
As spoken word lore has it, the first poetry slam—a competition of spoken word poetry—was held at the Get Me High Lounge in Chicago in November 1986; its organizer Marc Smith was a construction worker and poet who saw slam as a rebuke of establishment poetry, which he considered snobby and effete. As he later told the Smithsonian Magazine, “The very word ‘poetry’ repels people ... the slam gives it back to the people.”
The performative and fiercely inclusive world of slam grew in support; in 1993, MTV screened an Unplugged special dedicated to spoken word. Though a resurgence of interest in the Beat poets took place as a reference point, the spoken word movement was unique: it was a poetry that would not and could not be published, poetry motivated and constituted by the rough edges of populism.
Today, spoken word is still a form that insists on authenticity. Bob Holman, the original slammaster at the famed Nuyorican Poets Café in New York City, makes his own dramatic manifesto in the foreword to the book he co-edited “Aloud! Voices from the Nuyorican Café:” “Poetry has found a way to drill through the wax that has been collecting for decades! Poetry is no longer an exhibit in a Dust Museum! Poetry is alive; poetry is allowed!” As such, the spoken word scene incipient at Harvard and flourishing around Cambridge reflects spoken word’s essential qualities in its dogged inclusivity and troubled drive to competition.
SQUEEZE AND PULL
It makes sense that you have to go downstairs to get to the spoken word night at the Cantab Lounge in Central Square. Mute gestures at the bartender—a muffled “where’s the poetry, mate?”—and he points to a black door on a black wall, right next to the exit sign. I walk through reddish stairs that are shedding their paint and another black door: they’re charging five dollars tonight, because it’s a special occasion, but the room’s still packed.
The night begins with an open mic. I nestle into a corner and hug my knees. The first performer looks like the kind of nondescript guy you walk past 10 times a day, but when he reads his voice has the morbid, gravelly rhythm of an older William S. Burroughs. His grey hair is combed neatly down the middle and scraggly at the sides. The poem he reads is from another age, a meticulous record in dialog and detail of long adventures and short sentences. “Time,” he intones, “is not so slow as whiskey over ice.”
The next performer is a regular; the crowd starts laughing before she starts talking. “Walk of Shame Haikus,” she declares, and adjusts her suspenders. “One. Funny how the dawn / Turns a cocktail dress into / A whore’s uniform.” Her successor on the mic is professorial in his confidence; he offers 25% off his Adult Education course before he begins “The Virgin of Guadalupé.” Every time he says Guadalupé, he pops the long ‘é’ with the relish of a connoisseur. “Kiss me, mother of Mexico’s hope!”
The lights are meant to be dim but they catch peaked hats, bald patches, and androgynous crops of hair throughout the room. It’s hard to tell who’s here to listen and who’s here to perform. Shaundai E. Person steps up the microphone and doesn’t know how to adjust it. The crowd shouts: “Squeeze and pull!” She gets it and smiles shily. “Is it your first time?” Her nod is met with the biggest cheer of the evening. The moment she begins, the coyness is gone: she tells a ferocious tale of adultery and revenge. Later, Person tells me that her fiancé is big in the spoken word scene and she is just getting started. “At first I was real nervous on stage, but you have to put it all aside and think of people as just your friends around the coffee table,” she explains, while her fiancé beside her pretends not to listen. “In poetry you say what you feel and you can’t possibly be the only person that feels that way.” As I turn to go, another woman approaches her with compliments and questions.
SIGHT ON SELF
The lure of spoken word is not hard to understand. To have a completely accepting community of listeners who are also poets—or poets who are also listeners—is conducive to expression, particularly when that community defines itself by its diversity. “The reason I love spoken word,” Euphrat Weston explains, “is that it’s such a powerful thing for someone to write and then perform, right then in the moment, their own truths. I love it for its insistence on inclusivity and validating existences and emotions.”
One criterion rules the rest in spoken word poetry, and that is authenticity. A spoken word space is non-judgmental by definition, or at least by convention. The act of performance allows for an affectionate bond between the audience and the poet, which is especially apparent during open mics: in an audience of amateurs, everyone is part performer and part observer. It is a perfect setting for identity poetics—confessionals, polemics, and experiments with alternate selves abound.
Teake ’12, who has only one name—“I don’t know what my parents were thinking”—started spoken word poetry in Washington, D.C., last summer. ”As long as it’s true and good and engaging,” he says, “you don’t have anything to worry about when you get on stage. It’s not so much about agreeing—it’s about making connections through art.” The formula seems to be a little like this: write about yourself, and then convince the audience that it’s relevant to them.
For Teake, the externalization of personal identity issues often comes back to one important point: “being of mixed race in a country that loves to categorize people—the difficulties and the benefits and the joy that I take from that.” A studies of women, gender, and sexuality concentrator, Teake has focused his academic career on different conceptions of identity. “I try to use what I learned in my classes in a different way: with lots of theoretical ideas and social justice issues, but using the vernacular and making it accessible without jargon from academic circles.” The rebellion of singular voices against the identity prescriptions of establishment is a recurring feature of spoken word at large, according to Teake. The preeminence of the moment of performance gives privilege to individuality in a way that is opposed to dogma from the outset. Even the progressive academic source of Teake’s inspiration is mediated by his own style.
Euphrat Weston agrees about the importance of individuality and developmental identity. “Technique falls into place because of the things you have to say,” she says. “It personalizes other stories that would otherwise just be another statistic.”
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES
While individuality is inherent in spoken word, the competitive framework of a slam threatens to turn those personal stories back into statistics by reducing poems to comparative scores.
At the Cantab, it’s routine that a slam follow the open mic. Tonight, it’s the first round of try-outs for the team that will go to the National Poetry Slam being held this year in Boston—hosted in part by none other than the Cantab Lounge. A short break follows the open mic and the slam begins. The emcee takes the mic and says, “we are going to have two hours of spoken word poetry. You will be tired; you will cry. You will also laugh, and you will break your heart then build it up again better.”
The National Poetry Slam began in 1990, with three teams; it now features around 80 teams and lasts five days. The popularity of slam, however, is confined to the private sphere. When asked what makes a good poem in an interview, Yale Professor Harold Bloom lamented the rise of competitive performance poetry: “Now it’s all gone to hell. I can’t bear these accounts I read in the Times and elsewhere of these poetry slams, in which various young men and women in late-spots are declaiming rant and nonsense at each other … This isn’t even silly; it is the death of art.”
At the Cantab, the crowd climbs over itself to get a drink, or to line up for the restrooms, or to get another drink. I watch on from my corner and scribble, but before I know it I am being addressed. Brian S. Ellis has been coming here for five years, writing poems and “helping out.” He has a long schoolboy face with toothbrush sideburns and a wisp of beard; his green, striped tie is loud under his grey suit vest. Ellis wants me to be one of the five audience judges for the slam. “Just make a judgment,” he tells me. “Just do what your gut tells you.” My inexperience is an advantage: “Because the job of art is to communicate, the job of the poet is to make you feel!”
I am given a marker and a whiteboard. “You have three seconds to make a snap judgment about art, based on how much the poem makes you feel.” The scoring is Olympic, of course, with 0.0 the worst imaginable poem and 10.0 a perfect work of art. The job comes with free drinks.
A young man addresses a powerful monologue to autism, externalizing the discourse that would confine his life and trying to rise above the label given to him. I give it 8.7. Every time I give a bad score, I feel compelled to wipe off the board quickly. The death of a girlfriend: 9.2. Coming out: 7.8 (the jokes were a bit corny). The judge across from me—a self-styled ‘writer,’ a young bloke who stretches a black polo over thickset shoulders—keeps giving scores above 9, including a 9.9 and a 10. (Eventually he gives a 5 to a poem about the many types of smurf erotica, which climaxes in the line “who’s your Papa Smurf now?”) I can’t tell which of us is missing the point.
The most powerful poems are the most extreme ones. The rawer, the more confronting, the more I am inclined to give a high score. Little gasps or shouts go up from the audience from time to time. Every bad score is booed, occasionally accompanied by a “what’s wrong with you?” I only get one of these.
It turns out that I have done well—I’m told to come back next week—and it was just as they said: I laughed, I cried, and I confidently adjudicated between decimal points.
As these scores imply, there are better spoken word poets and worse ones. There are celebrities and no-hopers. There are enormous competitions where the very best rise to the top and become household names. Even the anti-elitist movement has its elite, and the slam is where they are knighted.
The folks at the Cantab weren’t competitive about things; slam was just a play for intrigue. Euphrat Weston claims that the all slams she has been to give a disclaimer about the form’s artifice. But there is no avoiding the effect that competition has on poetry. If the spoken word movement insists on inclusivity and authenticity, then what makes a winner and a loser? And if the quantity of emotion is the only metric, then what stops an art form from veering toward cliché and bombast?
CATHARSIS AND COMMUNION
For spoken word at large, the difference lies in the moment of performance, which radically changes both the nature and the goals of the art form. The act of performing a poem undoes it as a fixed, discrete unit of language. The poem is contained entirely in one unrepeated act of enunciation. The audience hears the voice of the poet, sees the tremble of a lip or the wave of a hand, and so is present for the moment of creation. Permanence is exchanged for relevance.
Euphrat Weston has many poems that she no longer performs. “I think, ‘I can’t read this anymore because it’s not me anymore,’” she says. Far from a bid to universal utterance, spoken word poets aspire to an expression of only that self that exists in the moment of performance. And that moment is contingent: the poem depends on the time, the place, and the audience. The act of performance is political and particularized, and ultimately the sole existence of the work—hence the supremacy of the individual voice, and the anti-dogmatic tendencies of the spoken word form.
In his essay “The Death of the Author,” Roland Barthes argues that “writing is the destruction of every voice, of every point of origin.” Spoken word poets do not write, they speak, and through their speech they insist on the point of origin so reduce the text to an instant. The fluid, developmental self has one opportunity to be understood correctly—at the expense, perhaps, of the complexity and the enduring richness of the work.
Spoken word represents a momentary catharsis for the listener and a lasting therapy for the poet: it is an opportunity for beauty and challenge and communion. In this sense, spoken word poetry departs from the conventional aims of art—it insists on the relevance of the poet over the transcendence of the poem. For a poem to instantly come alive, it has to face the fact of its immediate and inescapable death.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jill Sigman is the Artistic Director of the dance company jill sigman/ thinkdance, which she founded after completing her PhD in Philosophy at Princeton. Known for her provocative and eclectic style, she has performed in a wide variety of nontraditional spaces, including dilapidated industrial buildings, drained swimming pools, and a fence over a toxic canal. This past week she visited Harvard to lead a workshop entitled “Body, Movement, and Gender: Moving and Seeing” and give the keynote performance at “Educational Bodies: The Performance of Gender and Sexuality in Academia,” a conference sponsored by the Committee on Women, Gender, and Sexuality.
 
The Harvard Crimson: Can you tell me about your performance at Harvard this weekend? 
Jill Sigman: I was invited by the organizers to give a keynote performance, which is an interesting concept, because usually a keynote is a lecture. It’s really exciting for them to think about a performance as a keynote contribution that would be somehow like a center point that people could see and respond to as part of this [conference’s] exploration.
THC: For how long have you been dancing?
JS: I’ve been dancing for over 30 years. I was trained in classical ballet for about 12 years. I trained at the Joffrey Ballet and the Ballet Center of Brooklyn, and then I started studying modern dance in college. And I’ve been sort of migrating into more experimental forms of dance ever since then. And I feel like I still draw upon the kind of discipline and the certain features of those forms, of those dance genres, but it’s not always recognizable in the work because I’m not using those dance vocabularies any more. But I still very much value those traditions. 
 
THC: How has your approach to dance changed over the years?
JS: The way in which I was trained is to look at a body as one that executes a dance language, and I still use it in that way, but I’m also interested in how a body can be a material, kind of the way a visual artist would use other objects and physical materials.
 
THC: In what other ways have you deviated from the classical approach to dance?
JS: Well, as the work has gone on, my concept of what a dance is has grown broader, so that instead of just thinking that it’s bound to just movement and that it doesn’t matter where we put it, I’ve become more thoughtful about placing dance and creating environments for dances. And, for me, those aspects are just as much part of the meaning of the work. They contribute to the meaning as much as the movement does.
 
THC: Can you tell me more about your conception of the artist in contemporary society? What are some particular issues you bring to attention with your work?
JS: I’ve been working a lot to prod people to ask questions about what’s happening around them. I like to say I’m using the body as a medium to ask questions. Basically I want to people to think, and I don’t really care what they think as much as that they do think. 
Lately some of my work has dealt with issues around the environment, and the way that we’re producing a tremendous amount of waste that we can’t manage and that waste is having an effect on the planet. So, those are some of the issues. But I think I see the artist as a kind of lightning rod, kind of getting a vibe of what’s happening out there, and then saying to people, hey, let’s look at this. I’m giving them a way to look at it and to channel their responses and their emotions in a setting that is somehow off the map. I’m creating this visual, spatial place where they can think about things and feel things and see things that they might not have otherwise experienced.
 
THC: What is something that you would encourage students to explore while moving their bodies in their everyday lives? Is there any kind of awareness or particular attention to bodily movement you believe to be worthy of more consideration?
JS: I think how we move is completely integral to the identities we construct and the way we relate to things in the world. I think it’s very valuable for people to have some sort of practice of awareness and to kind of cultivate an awareness of what is your body, who is your body, what is it doing, what is it feeding you, what is it telling you so that we hear those things more readily, so that it’s not about subverting the body, but letting yourself be more aware of what the body can tell.

Be they saccharine songs about the object of an artist’s affection or spiteful rants about an ex’s every flaw, both love and breakup songs can be painfully predictable and frankly boring. However, a recent showcase at the Berklee College of Music managed to twist this clichéd subject into the theme for an evening of impressive performances.
On April 7 at Cafe 939 in Boston, Berklee’s best singer-songwriters, chosen from over 100 competitors, performed 10 songs in a free showcase. The show—split up into five songs about falling in love and another five about breaking up—was run entirely by students. Though the resulting atmosphere was relaxed, the students’ effort and skill transcended, resulting in an absorbing concert.
The Berklee Songwriters Club put together the show, from the advertising to the judging. “We organized rehearsals, we organized a house band, we advertised for submissions, we organized judging, got all of the food, and ran the sound check,” said Kayleigh N. Mill, one of the students in charge of the showcase. With the exception of sporadic technical difficulties, all of the work the students had put in contributed to a seamless series of performances.
Michael C. O’Donnell and Adam R. Kronowski, the two emcees, were excited about the opportunities that the student-run event afforded. “It’s all songs written by students, it’s hosted by students. There’s no teachers or professors, it’s all for us by us,” O’Donnell said.  “We’ve never done this before, but we just went up and had fun, had a good time,” Kronowski said. Creating a show run by students was particularly important to outgoing head of the Songwriters Club Ben P. Camp, as it forced everyone involved to take responsibility. “I’ve seen kids that were not particularly inspired, but you give them a challenge and they rise up to it,” he said, “and what you hear here is so much better than what I hear kids do for homework in class.”
The performers also appreciated the communal aspects of the show. “It was my first performance here, and it was a great way to meet people in a noncompetitive setting,” said Charles B. Johnson, who performed a song entitled “Squirrel.” The subject of the song, his girlfriend Adrienne Quinn, drove from New York to watch the show. Another singer-songwriter, Matt Politoski, brought a large contingent of friends, who even made signs for the performance.
However, this friendly, collegiate atmosphere did not detract from the quality of the performances, which were delivered by experienced musicians. “Mike Squillante [another performer] played the 2010 Warped Tour, wrote a 14-track album, produced every song, even made his own videos,” O’Donnell said. Andrea Belanger, who also participated in the showcase, is releasing a CD next week and is currently highly ranked in an online poll to book more bands for the Tennessee music festival Bonnaroo. 
Both Squillante and Belanger performed during the first half of the show, as the emcees deemed it, the “love-making section.” Fittingly enough, it began with a song intro quite similar to that of Sara Bareilles’ “Love Song.” The set also featured songs by Johnson, Dayley Duran, and Jonathan Downing. While the theme was love songs, deviations were permitted; Duran’s song “Escape” dealt not with falling in love, but rather escaping a horrible boyfriend. However, more faithful interpretations of the themes were also present, such as Johnson’s catchy number about his girlfriend, which culminated in a beautiful four-part harmony.
The second half, or the break-up section, featured more impressive performances by Politoski, Emily Dale, Aleks Georgi, Jesse Beauchamp, and the band Me vs Gravity. Dale, who was deeply involved in the organization of the show, led off with “Should’ve Made Me Stay,” a poignant song about making it “too damn easy to walk away” from a relationship. She was followed by Politoski, who passed time fixing a technical difficulty before his song “Staring Contest” by explaining the name. “Sometimes relationships are like staring contests, where you don’t want to win, because if you do you’re staring at someone who’s not looking at you.” While most of the song was rather subdued, it finished in an angry outburst at the presumed winner of such a staring contest.
Though unique, the Singer Songwriter Showcase is, as Camp stressed, not an isolated event. On April 19 there will be another free, student-run show in Boston: the Perfect Pitch concert. The concert will feature Berklee’s top vocalists singing songs written specifically for them by Berklee’s top songwriters. ”It allows everyone to do what they love,” Camp said.
The ultimate goal, though, is to expand. “I’ve heard Harvard a cappella groups, and I would love to get Harvard kids to come try out for Perfect Pitch,” Camp says. In fact, this year Perfect Pitch will feature its first non-Berklee singer, a student from Boston College. The Singer Songwriter Showcase is just the beginning.

It is generally unacceptable for people to lie on their backs in the middle of a museum gallery, but in one room at the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), adults and children alike covered the floor and gazed up at the vibrant, sparkling ceiling above them. “The lighting is much better down here,” one patron told her friends excitedly, and they all quickly dropped to the floor to delight in the whirl of colors above.
Dale Chihuly is used to creating such exhilaration. Chihuly, an artist who has been creating sculptures out of molten glass for over 40 years, is being featured in an exhibit at the MFA from April 10 to August 7. His creations possess a vivid energy and exuberance that aptly coincide with the awakening of spring.
The exhibit, called “Chihuly: Through the Looking Glass,” displays 12 original instillations designed specifically for the MFA. The intricate works were created by the artist and his team and evoke themes of nature and motion. “I would want my work to appear like it came from nature, so that if someone found it on a beach or in the forest, they might think it belonged there,” said Chihuly in the caption of one of his pieces. Unlike the work of many other glass artists, Chihuly’s creations possess an asymmetry that adds to their organic quality.
Chihuly uses the technique of glass blowing, in which molten glass is transformed through the use of centrifugal force and instruments such as blowpipes. The form originated as early as the last century B.C., and was used to make bowls, bottles, and glasses. In the ’60s, a group of artists, including Chihuly, saw beyond the practicality of the method and started to view glass blowing as an art form. After working at a glass-blowing factory in Venice in the late ’60s, he developed into one of the leaders of the avant-garde glass-blowing movement by creating flowing and colorful environments inspired by ice landscapes and forests. He has since displayed his work in over 200 museum collections worldwide.
The artist’s new exhibit at the MFA features 12 colorful installations, some of which are among the largest he has ever created. “There’s a lot more dimension in his works now,” said Richard Pearson, an MFA patron who viewed Chiluly’s exhibits in the ’80s. The most staggering of the new installments is “Lime Green Icicle Tower,” a soaring 42-foot work that resembles a gargantuan plant. Each ‘leaf’ on the tower has a slightly different hue, shape, and size, all of which give the structure a distinctive texture. Chihuly built the tower specifically for the courtyard, and it reflects impressively off the glass walls that surround it.
The exhibit’s dark lighting further accentuates the vibrancy of the glasswork. While the compositions are stunning on their own, Chihuly effectively employs juxtaposition to enhance the exoticism of his work. “Ikebana Boat” features a dull, wooden boat filled with lively and twisting figures. Chihuly’s “Tabac Baskets” and archaic Native American baskets sit side by side, the former echoing the intricacies and simple beauty of the latter. In the Persian Ceiling Room, a series of seashell and floral figures sit on a glass ceiling above. The reflections of light off the glass forms give the room a dreamy, underwater quality. “You feel like you’re at the bottom of the sea,” said patron Jane Tuckerman.
Despite the ease with which the sculptures currently fill the museum’s space, installing the project was a monumental task. Chihuly’s team brought 775 boxes of material into the museum and set them up over the span of three weeks, and engineers had to make sure that the museum could hold such enormous and delicate structures. Chihuly was careful to tailor his works to the rooms in which they would be displayed. “Chihuly designed the traffic flow through the rooms, and there’s a really nice rhythm to the exhibit,” said MFA senior curator Gerald W. R. Ward ’71.
While Chihuly’s works have been critically acclaimed for their complexity and innovation, they also produce an immediate emotional reaction. “The sense of movement makes his work joyful,” said Lynda Umbro, another MFA patron. “It makes me happy.” Ward agreed. “After a long winter, [Chihuly’s sculptures] are a taste of spring. They lift your spirits.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot of people noticed Alexander Heffner ’12’s op-ed in U.S. News and World Report last month that called a Harvard education “overrated.” Although some felt that this sort of attention on the College was not positive or productive, there are some important takeaways to gain from the piece. One is the idea that, as Heffner notes, the education at Harvard sometimes “means less community” and “less intimate interactions with professors.” Perhaps Harvard tried to address this long ago when it first implemented a policy that required professors to hold weekly office hours—yet this policy is not as efficient as it could be. The next step would be to implement a mandatory office hour attendance requirement for all students.
There is something wrong when professors sit in empty offices waiting for students like Heffner, who feel that the faculty is “inaccessible.” In early March, The Crimson published an article reporting low student attendance at office hours, showing that the faculty is doing its job in holding office hours but that students are often failing to show up. In the same article, Professor Eric A. Beerbohm said that a good way to motivate students to come to office hours is to just ask them. If students were obligated or mandated to attend, however, this would serve as sufficient motivation.
Many professors are coming up with creative ways to bridge the faculty-student gap, but a college-wide requirement would be the most direct approach and would go a long way toward accomplishing this. Students should be required to make at least one visit to their professors’ office hours per class each semester so that they can foster a more open relationship with them. With Teaching Fellows’ office hours being offered as well, professors’ office hours ought not to be overcrowded, and students will have an even wider choice of office hours to attend. In an effort to accommodate all students, instructors could even be more flexible with office hour times from week to week.
Although the requirement would be minimal, it would be the necessary push that many students need. A single interaction with a professor can make future visits less intimidating, and students will be more likely to visit as a result. Students are often embarrassed, shy, or uneasy about going to professors’ office hours if they don’t need help with course material, but office hour attendance doesn’t always have to be about that. It’s helpful and often interesting to talk to instructors outside of classroom setting, even if only to introduce oneself. It would undoubtedly create more of a connection between instructors and students in the classroom.
For the percentage of students who already attend office hours, this policy would not be a significant change. But for others don’t already do so, this could seem a bit drastic. The College should be able to build community to improve the quality of education, and taking such a measure is one way to do it even though for some it may seem as though the College is overstepping its boundaries or taking away student freedom. Some courses already mandate attendance in either office hours or other opportunities for student-faculty interaction such as small group lunches, and both students and professors benefit from this communication despite its being compulsory. In the end, everyone would realize that it’s worth it—but if not, twenty minutes once a semester isn’t too much time to waste.

By the end of this century, more than one billion people will have died in a pandemic of immeasurable scale and wide-reaching consequences. The disease is non-infectious, easily preventable, and widely prevalent in both the developed and developing world. The diagnosis? Tobacco.
According to the Center for Disease Control, tobacco use is responsible for over 443,000 annual deaths in the United States and is recognized as the single most preventable cause of premature deaths in our country. The global burden of disease from tobacco is even more staggering—an estimated five million annual deaths according to the World Health Organization. In an effort to counteract this tremendous loss of human life and productivity, in 2003 the WHO adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a treaty designed to strengthen tobacco regulations and increase awareness of the dangers of tobacco’s negative health effects worldwide. As one of the most quickly and widely ratified treaties in UN history and one of the first global attempts to address a chronic, non-communicable disease, the FCTC represents a landmark development in international health.
Despite the progress made in international tobacco control, the United States has yet to ratify the FCTC after its signing in 2004. In 2005, as a member of the Senate, President Obama helped draft a letter urging Former President George W. Bush to send the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Now, six years later, the FCTC has still not been passed to the Senate. As a major base for tobacco production and manufacturing and an influential world power, the United States has a responsibility to ratify the framework and take a more active role in both domestic and international tobacco control.
Tobacco use in the United States remains a critical issue. According to the American Heart Association, 23 percent of American men and 18 percent of American women over the age of 18 smoke. In addition, 28 percent of Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes an estimated 3,000 lung cancer and 46,000 heart disease deaths each year. Despite the significant health impact that tobacco use has on both smokers and non-smokers, U.S. tobacco legislation remains weak and insubstantial compared to the widely accepted FCTC policy. Federal healthcare programs do not cover smoking cessation programs, and only twenty-five states do not have laws banning smoking in public places.
However, while tobacco use is still a major health care issue, there is at least the reassurance that domestic smoking rates are on the decline. Unfortunately, the scale of tobacco usage globally is threatening to become an epidemic of much larger proportions than any seen in the United States. By 2030, tobacco use is expected to be the leading cause of death in the world, killing an estimated 8 million people a year, with 80 percent of deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries.
With tobacco use on the decline in the United States and most other developed countries, tobacco companies have redoubled their efforts in the developing world. According to the WHO, tobacco use in the developing world is rising by about 3.4 percent per year. In East Asia and the Pacific, the region of the world with the highest proportion of smokers, nearly two-thirds of all adult men smoke. For low-income nations, tobacco use is often a double evil- creating negative consequences for both the health and economic situation. Spending on tobacco products accounts for about 10 percent of the average smoker’s household income in Egypt, 17 percent in the Minhang district of China, and almost 20 percent in the Philippines–without even factoring in future medical costs and loss of productivity.
Legislation included within the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control focuses on several key issues, including raising greater awareness of smoking’s consequences, regulating tobacco advertising, and discouraging future tobacco use. While the United States has included some of these policies within the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, there are others that it has failed to address. These policies include creating comprehensive education programs on the consequences of tobacco use (including its “addictive characteristics” and the side-effects of “exposure to tobacco smoke”), providing affordable and accessible tobacco cessation programs, mandating stronger warning labels on cigarette cartons, and implementing tax policy deliberately designed to reduce tobacco consumption.
172 countries have already signed and ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and the United States’ failure to do so is disconcerting. The future impact of the tobacco epidemic is incalculable in the scale of its consequences. The United States, as a world leader, has a obligation to do its part in averting this crisis, and it is President Obama’s responsibility to give momentum to this initiative by pushing for the FCTC’s ratification. While it is too late for America to set a precedent, there is still time to take action and inspire change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We don’t believe in God, We believe in the People,” yells an impassioned woman to a crowd of protestors outside last week’s “Social Transformation By the Power of God” conference. The conference, sponsored by a Harvard Extension School student group, incited a sensationalistic controversy and invoked a group of students and community members to protest under the rhetorical banner of—according to one advertisement—“Hate Comes to Harvard.” In our haste to commence our own witch-hunt, we must understand that creating a safe space on campus does not mean shielding ourselves from tough dialogues. I have no sympathy for those who use the Christian faith as a justification for real bigotry. But let’s remind ourselves in the aftermath of this controversy that conflating people’s concerns about abortion and homosexuality with hate stymies wisdom, tolerance, and academic freedom.
Social Transformation conference speakers Dr. Lance Wallnau and Os Hillman, the targets of the protest, are not the greatest examples of tolerance or pluralism. But neither is the hyperbolic sentiment behind the campus response to the conference. A Harvard Crimson article covering the conference featured an interview with one student who argued that Harvard might no longer be a “safe space.” He ironically went on to say, “If I had my way, Harvard wouldn’t welcome people like this here.” Instead of imposing censorship in the name of safety and tolerance, we should hold ourselves to a higher standard of conduct, rhetoric, and pluralism.
It is the beauty of Harvard that we can drop by Transgender 101, attend “Meet the Mormons,” hit up a QSA protest, hear Senator Chuck Schumer’s take on winning the middle class for the Democrats, go to an NRA lecture, and then listen to a wide range of speakers at the Social Transformation conference all in the course of a week. By conscientiously engaging with Harvard’s—liberally slanted—microcosm of a pluralistic world, we may discover that life is rarely reducible to “us versus them.” Our stereotypes fall short when we stuff people’s beliefs into preconceived boxes. We make exhortations and espouse staunch beliefs often with little knowledge and even less mercy. This week, in the spirit of pluralism, go out on a limb, and give others the benefit of the doubt.
We read bits of online blogs and quotes distributed over email lists, but we don’t do ourselves any favors when we scoff at entire events that we don’t take the time to attend. I violate this advice as often as anyone, but last Saturday, I stopped by the protest and the Social Transformation conference. Both events boasted mostly community members; few students either protested or listened for themselves.
At the conference, Lance Wallnau illustrated the Seven Mountains approach to social change on the blackboard. I’m an evangelical-liturgical-Lutheran hybrid and hypersensitive to Christian theological disputes, but I cede that the barebones of this method of social change is hardly contentious. It stresses the infusion of values into religious communities, business, government, and media. On the Seven Mountains website, Os Hillman expressly writes that Christians are called to love all people, regardless of faith, lifestyle, or gender orientation.
On the small hill outside of Northwest Labs, a woman stood before the semi-circle of protestors and passionately raised her arm as she screamed, “We don’t believe in God, We believe in the People!” She received applause in full. The protestors’ renunciation of God under the guise of tolerance delegitimizes their mission to denounce hate speech. Tangled in the vehement spirit of the rally, protestors cheered over the worthlessness of God. I am not foolish enough to believe that everyone in the crowd would renounce God’s existence in another setting. But I wonder why they announced—and assumed that everyone shared—a disbelief in God.
People of nearly every major faith have received a powerful call to reform culture, and to encourage values in society. But consider the dichotomy between the religious and nonreligious spaces in our lives. We often limit our faith to the realm of morality and worship, but we assume a secular rhetoric in classrooms, discussions, and entrepreneurship. We attempt to solve human problems without the enlightenment of faith, even though many of our religious beliefs explain the source of—and solution to—social, political, and cultural problems.
People of faith cannot blindly accept secularism in the name of pluralism. It is the imperative of the modern world that we should seek the fulfillment of our own needs, and that humanity can solve the world’s crises. Most religions maintain that we cannot find fulfillment in the pursuit of our own wants and needs. They maintain that we cannot eradicate poverty, disease, corruption, and distress without finding meaning and sources of wisdom beyond our own transitory lives. Perhaps this is what the idea behind the Social Transformation conference can ultimately relay to Harvard: That our faith is relevant in every academic, social, and personal pursuit. We cannot leave our beliefs on the threshold or our experiences at the door. If we are creatures of faith, then we must embrace it, live it, and use it to inform our proposals, actions, and discussions.

The newest entrant into the feeding frenzy that is online dating is IvyDate, a site that promises to match people from the eight Ivy League schools as well as Oxford, Cambridge, and the London School of Economics. It does so under the pretense of connecting “exceptional singles.”  While we at The Crimson applaud the intentions of the site, we have to ask:  What exactly does it consider exceptional?
Merriam-Webster defines exceptional as “unusually good; outstanding.”  In that sense, we would like to pose the following question to our readers: Which part of this definition describes Yale? It doesn’t count if you just take “unusual,” or sometimes, “standing.”
After all, we Harvardians have long known that we are simply too good to date the majority of the people on earth and could hardly contain our initial excitement at the thought that there was finally a website to address our needs.  Unfortunately, IvyDate fails to exclude enough people.  With an acceptance rate that is rapidly approaching zero—or, as we like to think of it, “perfect exclusivity”—we simply shouldn’t have to deal with anything less than the choicest crop of the world’s finest institutions. IvyDate would do well, then, to separate the wheat from the chaff.
Really, folks. If this is supposed to be an exclusive service, why was Cornell included? This year’s U.S. News and World Report survey ranked this institution 15th on its list of top universities. This is indeed a slippery slope upon which we sit. If we let in number 15 now, what is stopping us from taking 151 later?  If we start letting in the riff-raff now, it won’t be long before we are on the same dating sites as students (we use the term loosely here) from such esteemed institutions as the University of Alabama.
As all sensible Harvard undergrads know, what we look for most in a partner is pedigree.  In the end, what is the purpose of marriage if not to secure our children a stronger, or even dual, legacy status? And what do we give them if, when they apply to college, we can say: “You know your mother still knows some people over at Dartmouth!”  How will we deal with the disappointed looks our children will give us every time their classmates at Andover bring up their own parents, who attended both Harvard and Yale? Tell them that Brown is a good school, too? Would anyone actually believe that?
IvyDate claims to cater to those “who value intellectual curiosity, love of learning, drive, and determination,” which is all fine and well for those who need to justify themselves with that sort of thing, but we don’t.  We know we are the best, and we aren’t afraid to say that we only want to date other people who fit that distinction. We could find intellectual curiosity in the University of Chicago if that’s what we were going for, but even the folks who created IvyDate knew well enough to leave them out of this.
In reality, as number one, it is indeed a step down to associate with anyone from any other university. But if we must, shouldn’t we be picky? In the end, however, these are just paltry concerns. We wouldn’t want to denigrate what will surely amount to a profound force for social cohesion.
Thank you, IvyDate, for attempting to address the societal need for relationships among the privileged—but next time, let’s see if we can come up with an even more inane definition of who the privileged really are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Ivy League drug dealers, one a former Harvard student and the other a Yale graduate, appeared in court on Friday to offer testimony against Jabrai Jordan Copney, the alleged gunman in the 2009 Kirkland shooting.
Chanequa N. Campbell, formerly a member of the Harvard Class of 2009, testified that Copney told her prior to the killing of Justin Cosby in a Kirkland House basement that he planned to steal drugs from Cosby.
This assertion is crucial to the prosecution’s theory that the shooting occurred during a felony attempt, giving them grounds to charge Copney with first-degree murder.
During her testimony, Campbell admitted to selling marijuana and cocaine during her time at Harvard.
Jules E. Bolton, who said he made a $40,000 profit selling marijuana during his time as a Yale student, told the jury that months before the May 2009 killing at Harvard, he was robbed of three pounds of marijuana by Copney and an associate—identified as Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, who was also indicted for the Kirkland murder and pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of manslaughter.
The prosecution is attempting to show that the alleged robbery of Bolton served as a template for Copney’s plan to rob Cosby at gunpoint.
Defense attorney John A. Amabile renewed a complaint he has been making since before the trial started last week: that any discussion of the alleged prior robbery of Bolton will unfairly prejudice the jury.
However, the earlier robbery was mentioned in front of the jury for the first time Friday, when Bolton took the stand. Bolton told jurors that he met Copney—who was dating Campbell’s close friend Brittany J. Smith, also a Harvard student at the time—in Campbell’s dorm room in 2008.
“We smoked marijuana and discussed doing a deal in the future,” Bolton said of his first meeting with Copney.
Bolton then said that Copney agreed to purchase three pounds of marijuana from him in New York City.
When the men met for the deal—Bolton accompanied by fellow Yale student Alexander T. King and Copney by Jiggetts—Jiggetts drew a semiautomatic pistol on the Yale students, and Bolton handed over the marijuana, Bolton said.
Bolton and King’s IDs—which Copney allegedly took during the robbery—were found months later, concealed alongside the gun that allegedly killed Cosby.
Above Amabile’s objections, the prosecution entered the two IDs into evidence on Friday.
Campbell was not questioned on the stand Friday about her knowledge of the robbery of the Yalies, though she has said in a different hearing that she was aware of it. However, prosecutor Daniel J. Bennett ’85 asked her several questions about attitudes that Copney generically expressed toward drug dealers.
“Did he indicate to you that people who sold drugs you could rob, because if you robbed those people who sold drugs, they couldn’t go to the police?” Bennett asked. Campbell said that Copney had communicated that view.
Campbell then said that Copney told her prior to the Kirkland shooting that he had visited the home of a drug dealer named Justin Cosby. The two men smoked marijuana together and agreed to meet in Kirkland House—where Copney would buy 1.5 pounds of high-quality marijuana and 1.5 pounds of a lower-grade marijuana from Cosby, according to Campbell.
“Did he indicate what his intention was with regard to this marijuana?” Bennett asked.
“Yes, he was gonna rob him,” Campbell replied.
On the day of the shooting, Campbell said, “[Copney] told me that his boys were coming up from New York and that stuff was going down.... Bliz [Jiggetts] was coming up with a hammer.”
Campbell clarified that “a hammer” referred to a gun.
Campbell added, “He said he wasn’t afraid, and if Justin came back looking for him or if there were any problems, then he would air it out and put Harvard on the news.”
On cross-examination, Campbell acknowledged that she sold marijuana and cocaine during her time at Harvard. Amabile asked both Campbell and Bolton, based on their experiences as drug dealers, about the potential for a dispute during a drug transaction. Both dealers confirmed that buyers and sellers might argue over the quantity, quality, and price of marijuana exchanged—helping Amabile lay the grounds for one aspect of his defense.
With this testimony on the record, Amabile may later argue that, rather than entering the Kirkland annex with the intent of robbing Cosby, Copney was planning on exchanging money for drugs—a transaction which turned violent when Cosby’s product was not what Copney expected.
If the prosecution cannot convince the jury that the shooting occurred during the commission of a felony which is itself punishable by life in prison, such as armed robbery, then the jury has been instructed that it cannot find Copney guilty of first-degree murder.
Amabile pushed Campbell to name varieties of high-quality marijuana as he attempted to establish that quality can cause arguments during drug deals.
“I’ve been to Amsterdam three times.... I’ve been exposed to marijuana from all over the world,” said Campbell, who according to a 2008 Crimson article spent her junior year abroad, visiting 12 countries on three continents.
Bennett also asked Campbell about her drug use. She said she had smoked marijuana about 1,000 times, including daily use with Copney during her senior year, when Copney was living in Smith’s room in Lowell House.

Three days after the Harvard class of 2011 receives their diplomas, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds will get a degree of her own.
Bates College in Lewiston, Maine will award Hammonds an honorary degree on May 29 for her work researching the relationship between medicine and race.
“Dean Hammonds exemplifies a range of the values that Bates embraces in its mission statement: engaging the transformative power of our differences, cultivating intellectual discovery and informed civic action,” Bates College President Elaine Tuttle Hansen said in a statement.
At its 145th commencement exercises, Bates will also honor pianist Frank Glazer—an artist-in-residence and lecturer at Bates—and inventor Robert S. Langer—a professor at MIT. The three honorees will speak at the ceremony.
According to the Bates press release, Hammonds is being recognized for her work as a “leading scholar in the field of the intersection of medicine and race.”
Hammonds said that the history of Bates College and its relationship to issues of diversity is particularly important to her.
“I’m honored to be selected by Bates College to speak at their 145th commencement,” Hammonds said. “As a female historian of race in America, I am particularly proud to receive an honorary degree from an institution that, as early as 1855, was educating men and women of all races and creeds on an equal basis.”
Examining issues of race and diversity has been a central theme in Hammonds’ career.
Hammonds is a professor of History of Science and African and African American Studies. This fall, she taught a freshman seminar on “The Concept of Race in Science and Medicine in the United States.”
Before coming to Harvard, Hammonds was a founding director of the Center for the Study of Diversity in Science, Technology, and Medicine at MIT.
Later, Hammonds served as Harvard’s first Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity before ultimately assuming her position as Dean of Harvard College.
Hammonds also holds an honorary doctor of humane letters from Spelman College, where she studied as an undergraduate.

Clare Morgana Gillis, an Atlantic reporter in Libya who completed her Ph.D. in medieval history this spring at Harvard, was captured by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi last Tuesday outside Brega, a city currently controlled by the Libyan government and plagued by intense fighting.
The Harvard History Department issued a news brief on the incident last Friday. Gillis, who has extensively covered the ongoing Libyan civil war, was detained with three other journalists— James Foley, an American freelance contributor to GlobalPost.com, Manu Brabo, a Spanish photographer, and Anton Hammerl, a South African photographer. Libyan rebels who witnessed the scene reported that the car carrying the journalists was stopped by fire exchange at an intersection, where the loyalists arrived in two pickup trucks and took the journalists into custody. The car was destroyed with a rocket-propelled grenade, but the driver was released.
The State Department, Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the GlobalPost have been working together to secure the journalists’ release. Human Rights Watch also claimed to have notified NATO of the potential location of the journalists. However, as of last Friday, GlobalPost said it had been unable to confirm reports coming from Libya that the journalists would be taken to Tripoli and released.
Gillis, who also received a masters from Harvard’s Germanic Languages and Literatures Department in 2003, was a history advisor in Adams House during the 2008-2009 academic year. She was a teaching fellow for nine undergraduate courses, including the sophomore history tutorial, Government 1082: “What is Property?” and History 1101: “Medieval Europe”—now known as Societies of the World 41.
“Clare Morgana Gillis was reporting on the situation in Libya on behalf of The Atlantic and other American publications,” said Atlantic editor James Bennet in an article published on the Atlantic website on April 7. “We appeal to the Libyan authorities for her immediate and safe release, and for that of the three other journalists detained with her.”
This incident came after the release three weeks ago of four New York Times journalists, who were detained by pro-Gaddafi forces for six days and received brutal treatment. Lynsey Addario, the only female journalist among the four, claimed that she suffered from beating, death threats, and sexual assault.

Kennedy School Women and Public Policy Program Director Iris Bohnet will serve as the school’s Academic Dean beginning July 1, according to a statement released on Thursday.
A behavioral economist, Bohnet has taught classes on gender equity and decision analysis since she came to the Kennedy School in 1998. Her work has also been featured in numerous publications, including the American Economic Review and the American Political Science Review.
As part of her new position, Bohnet will oversee the school’s faculty budget and academic curriculum. She will also be in charge of the Kennedy School Faculty Steering Committee.
Bohnet, who has committed much of her career to studying gender issues in the work place, will be the second woman in a row to serve as the Kennedy School Academic Dean. She will succeed Mary Jo Bane, who has held the position for the past five years.
Bohnet’s appointment comes in the midst of recent discussions on gender imbalance at the Kennedy school. Earlier this year, members of the Progressive Caucus—a student organization at the Kennedy School that addresses social justice issues—gave away homemade pastries to students in an attempt to raise awareness on the low percentage of female faculty at the Kennedy School.
But Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood, who personally appointed Bohnet, said he was not specifically looking for a woman when seeking to fill the position.
“I wanted someone who was superb,” Ellwood said.
However, the Dean said the fact that Bohnet is a woman with a renowned understanding of gender-related issues will allow her to bring an interesting perspective to her position.
Associate Professor of Public Policy Hannah R. Bowles, who has known Bohnet for 10 years, said she thought Bohnet was a great choice because of her experience in fields ranging from research to administration.
“She’s a real bridger,” Bowles said. “She can connect the researchers to people primarily in the teaching area.”
Bowles also said she thought Bohnet’s appointment was a great way to stress the Kennedy School’s commitment to international studies. Bohnet, a Swiss citizen, moved to the U.S. in 1997 to pursue research at the University of California, Berkeley.
As the new Academic Dean, Bohnet said she intends to promote interdisciplinary collaboration between the Kennedy School and other Harvard graduate schools and to raise awareness of gender issues among faculty and the student body.
“Faculty demographics can only be changed slowly over time—but we can affect very quickly who joins us at Harvard as a student, fellow or speaker,” Bohnet wrote in an email. She added she would also like to incorporate gender issues into the Kennedy’s School academic curriculum.­­­

Student leaders from a variety of campus organizations spent an afternoon learning about leadership techniques and strategies at the inaugural Leadership Symposium on Friday afternoon.
The event was hosted by the Presidents’ Forum, a committee within the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, with the goal of “[bridging] the gap between the hundreds of student organizations on campus,” wrote Presidents’ Forum chair Peter Chen ’13 in an emailed statement.
“In the past we have hosted prominent speakers, separate workshops, panels, and a presidents’ banquet, but this is the first year we have ever combined all three elements into one half-day event,” Chen added. “I hope that student leaders were able to come out of the symposium with tangible skills to bring back to their student organizations.”
The conference featured Cynthia Trudell, PepsiCo’s executive vice president and chief personnel officer, as a keynote speaker.
“Cynthia mentioned that growth is sustained through practicing creative insight, sensitivity ... flexibility, and adaptability,” said Alice Li ’12-13, one of the event organizers. “She said that if a company does not have these things, particularly this forward thinking of sustaining growth, it becomes a dinosaur.”
Following the keynote address, attendees split into groups to participate in workshops led by other entrepreneurs and leaders in business, including CEO of Hollard-Mark Chris Colbert, President and founder of Leadership Edge Inc. John Hawkins, and Senior Brand Manager for Lipton Iced Tea Stacy Taffet.
“Both the students and speakers were really amazing,” said organizer Ece Erdagoz ’14, adding that the workshops were very “interactive.”
The conference concluded with an awards ceremony honoring several outstanding student leaders and programs who had applied to the Institute’s Leadership Symposium Awards.
Francesca R.L. Reindel ’11, co-Director of the Science Cabinet, received the honor of Best Student Leader. The title of Best Student Group was awarded to the Cambridge After School Program. The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association and the Institute of Politics won in the category of Best Collaborative Effort for their “Brain Break for the Ballot” event, and the Best Mentorship Program award went to the Harvard chapter of the Directing through Recreation, Education, Adventure, and Mentoring organization.
Each of the winners received a $500 reward for their respective student groups.
Chen said that the Leadership Institute hopes to make the symposium an annual event.
“I definitely believe that [it] accomplished its goals,” he said. “I can’t wait for the 2012 Leadership Symposium.”

Recently proposed changes to the MCAT could result in a longer and more comprehensive version of the test, to be released in 2015.
Among the recommended changes are the redivision of the test into four new sections—molecular and cellular biology, biochemistry, behavioral and social sciences, and critical analysis and reasoning—and the addition of 90 minutes to the current exam, bringing the total test time to seven hours. The report, which was released by the MR5 Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges, also suggested the removal of the Writing Sample section.
The revisions to the exam are designed to “[give] attention to concepts that future physicians are likely to need,” including a better understanding of cultural and social sensitivity and of modern research methods and statistics, according to the recommendations.
The preliminary proposal will likely affect the pre-medical curriculum for students in the Class of 2015 and beyond, said Amjed Saffarini, executive director of pre-health programs at Kaplan Test Prep.
“From a content perspective, it’s arguably the biggest change ever,” he said.
According to Saffarini, the amount of science material covered will be
“roughly double the current content,” though he predicted that organic chemistry and physics will be de-emphasized in the new exam.
The recommendations are part of a new movement towards a more “holistic” evaluation of medical school applicants, and will likely intensify the pre-med curriculum for students who intend to take the MCAT in their junior year, Saffarini said.
“Students are going to be taking their prereqs earlier, compressing them, and taking more at the same time,” he said.
Saffarini added that he thought the increased amount of material covered on the MCAT would make it more difficult for non-science concentrators to fulfill their pre-med requirements.
“Having that many more prereqs is not going to encourage students to go into medicine from the humanities,” he said.
However, Harvard students may not experience any extra course requirements, according to Director of Premedical and Health Career Advising Lee Ann Michelson ’77.
“I actually don’t see this as adding to the burden on our students,” she said. “The push is on having students seeing certain competencies rather than certain courses.”
Michelson said Harvard is “a little ahead of the game” in its current pre-med course offerings, citing the Life Sciences 1a/1b and Chemistry 17/27 series as interdisciplinary science courses that she thinks will help prepare pre-med students for the new MCAT.
Michelson added that Harvard’s curriculum may already address some of the new topics on the revised exam.
“Critical analysis and behavioral science are things they’re going to get from other classes they take here,” she said. “I think that with Harvard’s distribution requirements in Gen Ed, you’re going to be getting these kinds of concepts already.”
But students may be required to take one semester of biochemistry and only one semester of organic chemistry instead of the two semesters of organic chemistry currently required by most medical schools, Michelson said.
“I think we’re lucky in that we’re a large research institution,” she said of Harvard’s curriculum. “We have resources to make sure that our courses will meet pre-med requirements.”
In 2010, 309 Harvard undergraduates and alumni applied to medical school, according to data collected by the Association of American Medical Colleges.
Joshua E. Martin ’11, who took the MCAT in June of his junior year, said he was glad he took the current—and shorter—version of the exam.
“I think [the changes] would not have affected my decision to take the MCAT, but I think [they] would have made the MCAT much more painful,” he said.
Over the next few months, the committee will solicit feedback on their preliminary recommendations before releasing a final proposal in November.
The Association of American Medical Colleges Board of Directors will then approve these recommendations for the creation of a new MCAT next February.

The Cambridge City Council voted 8-0 last Monday to approve the selection of Goody Clancy & Associates, a Boston architecture and planning firm, to research potential business and residential development in Kendall and Central Squares.
“Each square has its own identity,” Assistant City Manager for Community Development Brian P. Murphy ’86-87 said. “Kendall and Central are going under transformation.”
The study approved by the City Council follows zoning changes proposed by the Broad Institute and Novartis for additional building space in Cambridge.
According to The Tech—MIT’s student newspaper—MIT was expected to propose zoning changes in January, but delayed because the City said it would conduct its own planning study.
MIT will pay $175,000 to the city to support the study.
“At one point, [Kendall] was an industrial area and now it’s an epicenter of life sciences.” Murphy said. “An amazing transformation has already taken place and this is just the next chapter.”
The proposed changes include increases in retail outlets, public gathering spaces, entertainment venues, lab and office spaces, and residential areas.
Goody Clancy’s planning study should take about a year, during which the consulting firm will reach out and gather public comment and reaction to potential changes, Murphy said.
“They have a strong reputation in urban planning,” City Councilor Sam Seidel said. “They’ve done work with Cambridge before ... We have high expectations about what they’re going to bring to this discussion.”
According to Sarah E. Gallop, Co-Director of Government and Community Relations at MIT, there have already been two information sessions with the City Council to discuss potential proposals.
“We’ve been working on this for a year ... We’ve been talking to neighborhood organizations,” Gallop said.
According to Gallop, the planning and construction process—currently in preliminary stages—will include eight buildings and could take up to five to seven years to complete.
“We’re not in a rush,” Gallop said. “We want to do it right because this project is for the broader community.”
While a potentially expensive project, Gallop said that “[MIT]’s so far away from thinking about costs ... We’re trying to make sure that people think this is a good idea.”
Gallop added that the end of the recession—combined with subsidized retail and careful planning—are all factors that could help MIT’s project run more smoothly than Harvard’s recent development in Allston.

There are some questions the world may never solve. We may never decipher the true meaning of life, or the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop—but for every other question, there’s no one better to ask than the Harvard Quiz Bowl team.
Following a 385-330 victory over Minnesota in the finals of the Intercollegiate Champion Tournament (ICT) in Chicago on Saturday night, Harvard’s quiz bowl team became not only the national champion for the second consecutive year, but also the first purely undergraduate team to ever win the Division I title in the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament.
“It’s a pretty amazing feat,” said Chad Kubicek, Chief Financial Officer of the National Academic Quiz Tournaments company (NAQT). “The game really does reward experience ... so a very large number of the best players in the game are grad students. And to be able to beat every team without a grad student is very impressive.”
The ICT is one of two annual quiz bowl championship tournaments in the nation and features 32 Division I teams and 14 rounds of play that occur throughout a single day.
The Harvard team is comprised of four core players, each of whom specializes in a subject area, according to team president Andrew M. Watkins ’11. A chemistry concentrator, Watkins is the team’s science expert. Most history questions are handled by Dallas R. Simons ’12—who is actually a physics and mathematics double concentrator—while English concentrator Theodore J. Gioia ’12 covers literature. As for the remaining questions, newcomer Jung Hoon “Stephen” Liu ’14 often has the answer.
“Having that really deep knowledge of the subjects really helps you against other teams,” Liu said. “In covering the major distribution of questions, I don’t think we had any major holes.”
The Harvard team, which was heavily favored as the returning champion, was able to breeze through the preliminary rounds and most of the playoffs, defeating some opponents by over 500 points, according to the NAQT.
“We ended up going undefeated. We went 14-0,” Simons said of the one-day tournament. “We felt like we were in control the whole time.”
The Crimson quiz bowlers’ closest match came in the finals against Minnesota, which was closing in on their early lead.
The squad was baffled when Watkins—showing ability beyond his science expertise—answered the deciding question, an inquiry concerning the history of Thailand.
“Andy buzzed in, and he hadn’t gotten a history question all tournament,”
Simons said. “It was funny that he took that one.”
“It was not in a category that I’m comfortable with or generally speaking, good at,” Watkins said. “But with only a few seconds [to react], you can’t really induce your teammates to answer the question.”

Following a competitive application process, the Houses have hired 69 new resident tutors to advise undergraduates next year.
These tutors­—who are usually Harvard or MIT graduate students—receive free room and board in exchange for monitoring undergraduates.
The number of tutors hired varied widely from House to House—Dunster hired nine new tutors while Lowell hired just two.
According to House staff, the number of open tutor positions varies each year, depending on the number of tutors departing at the end of the current school year.
Most Houses receive over 200 applications—this year Currier had 247 applicants and Cabot received about 230.
Eliot received only 180 applicants for its eight available tutor positions.
Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe said she did not know the reason for this low number, but that House administrators were looking into the issue to increase numbers for next year.
Although preliminary decisions have been completed, tutor selection remains an ongoing process, as some current House tutors have yet to finalize their plans for the coming year.
Additionally, prospective tutors were able to apply to multiple Houses—an option many took advantage of.
Some applicants receive offers from multiple Houses, which can extend offers to additional tutors if their initial hires turn them down.
The application process varies throughout the Houses, but generally involves a written application as well as a series of interviews.
Many Houses also seek students’ opinions as part of the selection process.
Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana said that the masters worked with tutors and students to find candidates with “Cabot House values” who would fit in well with the House community.
According to Lowell House tutor Van C. Tran, his House, which requires that candidates have a separate interview with House administrators and with undergraduates, highly values student input.
“The students are invited to meet with us and tell us their reactions to every candidate,” Tran said.
He said that Lowell looks for tutors that have a good balance of academic prowess and advising skills.
“I have seen this before—brilliant people who just can’t advise, who don’t know how to advise,” Tran said. “That happens a lot.”
Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 said that tutor selection is one of the main ways House Masters can maintain House identity.
Since students are randomly assigned, tutors can help to make the House experience unique, Palfrey said.
Adams House involves students and current tutors in the selection process, he said, though House Masters make the final decisions.

A frustrated Undergraduate Council heavily debated legislation supporting the Harvard chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future (SJSF) before ultimately deciding to “kill the bill” due to concerns about setting unintended precedents.
SJSF, a student-led volunteer network that campaigns for solutions to the current climate crisis, plans to host a lobbying event on Earth Day and solicited official UC support for their cause, which would have provided them with publicity through inclusion in both the UC Weekly and the UC’s VeriCorps event sign-up list.
However, some members raised concerns that this legislation would be setting dangerous precedents. In particular, members worried that formally endorsing a group that promoted a particular cause—as opposed to other more campus-centric groups—would put the UC in a position of making decisions on what types of causes were appropriate to endorse.
Tengbo Li ’12, UC Education Committee Chair and sponsor of the act, tried to ensure members that this would not be an issue.
“While a lot of student groups may use us as a resource, I don’t think this is setting us up for any sort of tidal wave of student groups using us as publicity for their causes,” Li said.
Others felt that legislation was an unnecessary formality that would inconvenience future UC legislative procedures.
“We don’t want to set precedent that every time we want something on the UC Weekly, we bring it before council and debate for 20 minutes,” said UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair David Gonzalez ’11.
Daniel P. Bicknell ’13, who ultimately motioned to kill the bill, said he agreed with Gonzalez.
“I look forward to the event, but I don’t think we need legislation to support this,” he said.
As an alternative, Bicknell proposed that the event be publicized on the UC Weekly as a “featured event”—essentially maintaining the same publicity that would have been established by the debated publicity act, he said.
The only major change resulting from not passing the legislation is that the event will not also receive the informal endorsement of VeriCorps—a new UC initiative that aims to connect student groups and their events with interested students.
“Vericorps just started and it was publicized as supporting events, not advocacy things, so I feel uncomfortable having VeriCorps give this event official endorsement,” said Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14, the UC representative who had sponsored VeriCorps.
“This event doesn’t have to be publicized through the UC, it could always just be publicized through normal means like house lists.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors and students discussed the deep connection between America’s history of human bondage and its economic ascendancy during a three-day conference at Harvard and Brown University entitled “Slavery’s Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development.”
The conference—co-organized by Sven Beckert, a history professor at Harvard, and Seth E. Rockman, an associate history professor at Brown—featured panel discussions, a keynote speech by Brown University President Ruth J. Simmons, and sessions showcasing undergraduates’ research on slavery.
The conference, according to Rockman, aimed to “make the audience recognize all the ways in which slavery is central, and not marginal, to the history of the American economy.”
An audience of academic scholars filled the Thompson Room of the Barker Center Saturday for the last day of the conference.
Beckert, in his opening remarks Saturday morning, said that “one finds that this [separation between capitalism and slavery in American History] is, in fact, fiction.”
Undergraduate students in Beckert’s course History 84g: “Harvard and Slavery” gave presentations during a poster session Saturday afternoon, showcasing their research on slavery, its relationship with capitalism, and its connection to academic institutions like Harvard.
Alexa A. Rahman ’12, a history concentrator in Beckert’s course, noted that “Harvard is not without ties to slavery.”
Rahman is conducting research on Edwin F. Atkins, a prominent entrepreneur at the end of the 19th century.
Atkins made donations to Harvard with wealth derived from his Cuban sugarcane plantation, which had used slave labor up until the abolition of slavery in Cuba in 1886.
After emancipation, Atkins established a Harvard-run botanical research institute on his plantation, which still relied heavily on labor from low-wage former slaves.
There is proof that “experimentation at the Atkins Institute [in Cuba] continued until Castro’s revolution,” Rahman continued.
“It was fascinating to find that other academic institutions had similar stories with plantations at the time,” Rahman added.
Learah T. Lockhart ’12, another student in the “Harvard and Slavery” course, presented her preliminary findings at the conference.
Lockhart investigated Harvard President Josiah Quincy’s decision to prohibit a debate on abolition at the Harvard Divinity School, which was called the Theological School at the time.
“The Philanthropic Society, a benevolent and debating society, wanted to hold a debate on abolition but was prevented from doing so by the administration,” Lockhart said. “The administration claimed no events were to be held by students with strangers from outside the College.”
The conference began at Brown, where students also showcased their research on the relationship between slavery and capitalism.
Unlike Harvard, Brown University published a report about the institution’s links to slavery in the fall of 2006, titled “Slavery and Justice.”
“Brown took real leadership in investigating its connection to slavery,” Beckert said.

In her keynote speech at the Black Policy Conference at Harvard Kennedy School on Friday, the Honorable Susan E. Rice, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, emphasized that while the U.S. is committed to protecting the people of Libya, it will limit its involvement to actions dictated by a larger international effort.
Rice described the U.S. mission in Libya as one that is “limited in time, scope and purpose.”
She emphasized that the decision to intervene against Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi was ultimately left to the U.N. Security Council rather than to the U.S. She added that the U.S. would not have intervened if other countries had not supported the decision.
The vote to approve a no-fly zone and “all necessary measures” to protect civilians was approved by the U.N. Security Council in a 10-0 vote with five abstentions last month.
Because of the U.S. commitment to working within the guidelines set by the United Nations and to conducting missions only from the air rather than through ground troops, Rice recognized that the U.S. ability to protect civilians is imperfect.
“We are doing what can be done with our partners as part of a coalition pursuant in an international mission,” Rice said. “There are limits to what you can do in terms of civilian protection from the air.”
Rice said that international attitudes towards intervening in countries undergoing humanitarian crises has been shaped by many events in the last two decades, including the situations in Darfur, Rwanda, and Kosovo.
“Since 1994, there has been a great deal of evolution in ideas about humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to protect,” Rice said.
However, she added that there is no “cookie cutter answer” and that every situation warrants an analysis of its own set of circumstances.
Organizers of the event said that Ambassador Rice was an excellent choice to begin the conference because she has set a powerful example for the African-American community.
“The first (and youngest) African-American female to hold the position of US Ambassador to the UN, Ambassador Rice is a role model not only for communities of color, but for females and young professionals,” Gabrielle L. Wyatt, a Kennedy School student and one of the organizers of the event, wrote in an emailed statement. “At this historic period in our nation, we have the opportunity to become visible examples of hope; Ambassador Rice’s character, heritage, and career represents just that.”
The Black Policy Conference hosted many speakers on both Friday and Saturday, including Kasim Reed, the Mayor of Atlanta, and Kaya Henderson, the Chancellor of Washington, D.C. public schools.

UPDATE: Police Provide Information About Two Men Arrested After Chase Through Harvard Yard
A foot chase by police ended with the apprehension of two suspects in Harvard Yard around noon today.
Around 11:45 a.m., two men in black jackets ran out of the T station through Johnston Gate in the direction of Memorial Church, pursued by one officer.
Harvard University and Cambridge police quickly converged on the northeast corner of the Yard, where the men were eventually caught by Cambridge officers in Canaday Hall. They were taken from the scene in a Cambridge police van.
The suspects were wanted for stealing at least one cell phone from a T-Mobile store, according to police radio transmissions overheard by a Crimson reporter.

The search for new members of the Harvard Corporation is likely to yield candidates with more specialized areas of expertise, according to senior fellow of the Corporation Robert D. Reischauer ’63.
Historically, individuals selected to serve on the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—have been generalists with a broad spectrum of knowledge and skills, as the size of the Corporation has been limited to seven members—six fellows and the University president.
In December, the Corporation announced a significant overhaul of its governance structure, which will expand the group to 13 members. The increased size will allow for more specialization in areas important to the University, according to Reischauer.
The Corporation has made a list of 10 or 12 important skills, and is currently looking “for people that fill two or three of them,” Reischauer said.
“We’ve sat down and had many conversations about what are the attributes and dimensions of potential members that we think would most strengthen the capacity of the Corporation,” he said.
The Corporation has solicited advice and suggestions of possible candidates from alumni and other members of the Harvard community.
Over 300 names of individuals have been submitted, according Reischauer.
Reischauer declined to say how many names remained on the list, except that “there are a lot fewer than 300.”
The Corporation will increase its size gradually, adding only a few members this year.
The report of the Governance Review Committee, which announced the changes, stated that “some adjustments will likely be necessary to assure appropriately staggered periods of service” as the body grows to its larger size.
University President Drew G. Faust said that she would like to have two or three new members of the Corporation in place by the start of the 2011-2012 academic year.
The Corporation’s reform also includes the creation of several new committees that will focus on issues such as finance, governance, capital planning and facilities.
Reischauer said that though the Corporation members have discussed the new committees, they are still in the process of formulating their charters.
The reforms also include term limits for Corporation members. Fellows will now be limited to six years in office with the possibility of a six-year extension.
After the 13-person Corporation is fully established, two new members will be selected every two years. This procedure means that the search process “is no longer an episodic exercise,” Reischauer said.
According to Faust, the Corporation is in the process of developing a system that the board will use regularly to generate new members.
From now on, the Corporation will create lists and keep track of individuals over time, examining their engagement with Harvard and their specific capacities, Reischauer said. This measure will help the Corporation to create a “pool” of potential candidates to draw from in the future, Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge police officers arrested two male suspects in the vicinity of Canaday Hall at approximately noon yesterday after a foot chase through Harvard Yard.
The suspects—identified by police as Jeremiah Davis, 19, and Matthew Davis, 20—also gained access to the Harvard College Women’s Center in the basement of Canaday prior to their arrest, despite the area’s being restricted to Harvard affiliates with valid HUIDs. Witness reports also suggest that the men tried to enter other doors in the building.
The Harvard University Police Department is attempting to determine how the men were able to enter Canaday, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
The men allegedly stole two cell phones from a T-Mobile store in Harvard Square and were charged with larceny over $250 and trespassing. Matthew Davis was also charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer. He allegedly assaulted the arresting officer while being placed under arrest and attempting to flee, according to the police report.
After T-Mobile employees reported the crime at approximately 11:41 a.m., police identified men who matched the description of the subjects in the Harvard Square T Station. The two men ran upon sight of the police, according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello.
As tourists and students traversed the Yard, a Cambridge police officer followed the men on foot from the T stop through Johnston Gate to the northeast corner of the Yard. The officers appeared to temporarily lose track of the suspects between Thayer Hall and Memorial Church.
At approximately 11:58 a.m., the suspects ran into the Harvard College Women’s Center but turned around and left shortly after, according to Assistant Dean for Student Life and Director of the Harvard College Women’s Center Susan B. Marine.
Serena L. Bai ’13, who was sitting in the Canaday common room, heard the suspects make a slamming sound as they presumably tried to enter the building. After not gaining access, they ran to the opposite end of the dorm’s courtyard with police officers in pursuit.
A few minutes later the Cambridge police emerged with the suspects in custody, Bai said.
While spokespeople from the Harvard University and Cambridge Police Departments did not provide a precise number of the officers who responded, several police cars and at least a dozen officers from the two departments converged on the scene.
Cambridge police recovered the two stolen phones—both of which still had security devices attached—after the arrest, according to Riviello.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The second week of Jabrai Jordan Copney’s murder trial opened yesterday with a full day of testimony that focused heavily on forensic evidence.
As prosecutors continued to present their case—aiming to prove that Copney shot Cambridge resident Justin Cosby in the Kirkland House annex—yesterday’s testimony centered on bullet casings, bloodstains, and fingerprints.
A string of police officers and forensic experts took to the witness stand to discuss DNA swabbing techniques, tests for the presence of human blood, and chemical checks for gunshot residue. The jury viewed some graphic evidence, including the blood-soaked T-shirt that Cosby was wearing when he died and up-close photographs of dried blood streaking the stairwell of Kirkland’s J entryway.
Yesterday also saw the end of the testimony of Jules E. Bolton, the 2009 Yale graduate who said in his initial appearance on Friday that he was robbed of three pounds of marijuana at gunpoint by Copney in 2008.
During his two days on the stand, Bolton said that he earned about $40,000 by selling marijuana at Yale and did not report that income on his tax returns.
Defense attorney John A. Amabile indicated on Friday in a dialogue before the jury entered the courtroom that he planned to cast Bolton’s failure to pay taxes on his drug profits as a sign that he is liable to lie on the witness stand.
Bolton recounted his extensive experiences buying, selling, and using marijuana. At one point, Amabile asked Bolton to identify the contents of a package.
“It looks like marijuana, but I’d need a closer inspection to be sure,” Bolton said. He then asked permission to remove the layers of plastic surrounding the package in order to get a clearer glimpse of the substance.
As the attorneys began to convene with the judge about whether Bolton could legally remove the wrapping, Bolton called out a suggestion.
“Maybe a sampling,” he offered. “I’d be absolutely certain.”
A police officer was called to open the package.
Katherine A. Carroll ’09 also took the stand yesterday to identify photographs of the Lowell House room in which she lived during her senior year at Harvard. The gun that prosecutors allege was used to kill Cosby was found by police under Carroll’s bed—allegedly stowed there, without Carroll’s knowledge, by former Harvard student Brittany J. Smith, one of Carroll’s blockmates.
Smith, who is dating Copney, has been indicted herself on charges that she hid the murder weapon and helped Copney and his accomplices flee to New York City after the crime. She is tentatively scheduled to be tried after Copney’s trial concludes.
After questioning Carroll about the photographs of her room and the police’s procedure in searching it, Assistant District Attorney Daniel J. Bennett ’85 asked, “Now, had you ever put a gun under your bed in a trash bag?” Carroll said no, leaving Bennett with no further questions for her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In yesterday’s early morning game against No. 6 Michigan, Harvard women’s water polo was finally able to apply those lessons it learned playing big-name teams on its California road trip earlier this season.
Although the Crimson was unable to pull out a win over the Wolverines (25-4), it was at least able to offer a solid 13-10 competition just as it did against No. 2 Cal and No. 9 San Jose State over spring break.
“In California, we learned how to play with teams like Michigan,” junior attacker Monica Zdrojewski said. “Over the course of the trip, we learned how to…shut [those teams] down.”
The Crimson went 1-2 in its opening series of Collegiate Water Polo Association conference games this weekend against No. 18 Princeton, Bucknell and Michigan at the Bison’s Kinney Natatorium. Harvard claimed its sole victory over the competition’s host, Bucknell.
“It was a good weekend for us,” sophomore attacker Aisha Price said. “We improved in a short period of time, and we’re getting more confidence within ourselves as we go.”
MICHIGAN 13, HARVARD 10
The Crimson had to come prepared to face the Wolverines, one of its toughest opponents on Harvard’s schedule.
“Bucknell did a good job of making us think on defense,” Price said. “We had to know where to pass the ball, where to drop the ball, where to help each other out. After getting so many ejections in that game, in the Michigan game, we used those lessons and were on our toes and able to play smart defense.”
“We played really well and only lost by three, which is a huge credit to our team,” she added.
The Crimson defense worked primarily to stop Wolverine counterattacks, as size and speed were both on Michigan’s side, according to Zdrojewski.
“Offensively, we were hoping to build off our defense,” the junior said. “We wanted to get a lot of movement going, get them out of their comfort zone, and I think we were successful in doing that.”
The women may have successfully shut down Wolverines’ defense, but their efforts against the Michigan offense were not enough and landed Harvard on the wrong side of its second three-point game of the weekend.
HARVARD 16, BUCKNELL 13
A game marked by numerous ejections and a few near-kickouts for Harvard players, Saturday afternoon’s matchup against Bucknell (10-12) allowed for a total of seven Crimson players to contribute goals to the final 16-13 tally.
“There were a lot of people who had two ejections, so we had to dig deep into our bench for players,” said Price, who led Harvard with five goals against the Bison. “That allowed people to a get a lot of minutes and others to get a lot of scoring opportunities.”
The frequent drives and constant movement that help characterize Bucknell’s offense enabled the Bison to draw a high number of ejections as well as keep the score close throughout much of the game.
But once the Crimson was able to adjust, Harvard pulled ahead in the fourth to take the win.
“They’re a pretty tricky team,” Price said. “They were able to get inside water on us and they drove a lot. We’ll just need to keep working on our drive defense.”
In addition to the difficulties associated wtih Bucknell’s mobile offense, the Crimson needed to overcome the challenges posed by the Bison’s depth.
“They have a larger team than we do,” Zdrojewski said. “They were able to replace their six whenever. They always had a group that was fresh.”
PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 5
Harvard’s first points of the weekend did not come until after Princeton (16-9) finished its significant 6-0 run in the opening minutes of Saturday morning’s game.
The Crimson was able to recover in the second half, holding the Tigers point-for-point throughout the remainder of the game.
“Once we were able to get a point on the scoreboard, in the second half, we really got the momentum going, “ Zdrojewski said. “We went on a four-goal run. We were able to figure out everything that was going on in this half and were really able to put the ball away.”
But the early six-goal deficit proved to be too much for Harvard to overcome, as that familiar gap stayed on the scoreboard until the end of the game.
Sophomore Elise Molnar led the squad with two goals and two assists.
Although Princeton is a ranked team, Harvard believes a win over the Tigers is definitely feasible should the two teams meet again at the Eastern Championships. Additionally, this weekend indicated to the Crimson that it has potential to overthrow these ranked teams in future competitions.
“After the Michigan game, we came out smiling and laughing, because it really showed us we can play with the best teams on the East Coast,” Zdrojewski said. “It’ll push us through practices and prepare us for our games next weekend and for the Eastern Championships, and hopefully, we’ll be able to beat [those teams] at that point.”

If Saturday’s matchup between Ivy League softball powers Harvard and Cornell is any indication, the race for the Ancient Eight crown will be another close one.
In a rematch of last year’s championship series, the Crimson (20-12, 6-2 Ivy) and the Big Red (16-14-1, 5-3) split a doubleheader at Soldiers Field on Saturday afternoon. Cornell ace Elizabeth Dalrymple was the hero of Game 1, carrying her team to an 8-1 victory, but Harvard’s potent offense finally broke out late in Game 2 in a 7-5 win for the home team.
“I love to play [the Big Red],” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “I think they’re a great ball club, and you’ve got to come to play, you’ve got to put your battle gear on and fight. And both teams fought hard.”
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 5
With two outs in the bottom of the sixth inning and with a 4-2 lead, it looked like Dalrymple was on her way to her second win of the day. But freshman Allison Scott drew a walk that sparked a five-run rally, securing a 7-5 win and the series split.
“Everyone had some adjustments to make individually, and in addition to that, [we had] a better collective energy to just attack [Dalrymple] and not be intimidated by her stats,” co-captain Ellen Macadam said.
After Scott’s walk, classmate Shelbi Olson came to the plate and connected for her first collegiate home run, a bomb to right field that tied the score at four.
“Shelbi really stepped up,” Allard said. “She’s been inconsistent a little at the plate, and it was nice to see her see a pitch and really just take a good cut.”
Back-to-back singles from junior Jane Alexander and freshman Jackie Cooley kept the rally going and brought Macadam to the plate. Macadam, the team’s hottest hitter with a .411 average, then sent another Dalrymple pitch over the fence in right-center to give Harvard a 7-4 lead.
“I attribute all of that to Jane and to Jackie for keeping that rally going with two outs,” Macadam said. “That’s what our team is, that’s what we can be.”
Macadam’s homer chased Dalrymple from the game, and though reliever Jenna Stoller allowed a pair of singles, she got junior Whitney Shaw to pop out in foul territory to escape the jam.
Cornell had jumped out to an early 1-0 lead in the first inning, when Jenny Edwards hit an RBI double off junior pitcher Rachel Brown. Rookie Laura Ricciardone relieved Brown and, after allowing a single to the first batter she faced, retired 14 straight Big Red hitters.
“We got Laura in there quickly, and Laura did a really good job of hitting her spots and keeping them off balance,” Allard said. “And they’re a good hitting club. She did a great job.”
Harvard tied the game in the bottom of the second on Alexander’s RBI double to center field and took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the third, when Shaw doubled home Macadam.
Cornell finally strung some hits together in the top of the fifth, with Edwards once again providing the punch with a 2-RBI double to right. Erin Keene then plated Edwards with a single down the first-base line.
The Big Red added a fifth run in the seventh inning, but Ricciardone held on for her seventh win of the season.
CORNELL 8, HARVARD 1
Cornell dominated Game 1 from start to finish, with Dalrymple shutting down Harvard’s lineup and the Big Red coming up with a series of big hits in an 8-1 win.
After both pitchers cruised through the first two innings, Brown ran into trouble in the third. Marissa Amiraian put Cornell on the board with a triple down the first-base line and came around to score on an Edwards single. Kristen Towne got on base with a single to shallow right, and Erin Belles then broke the game open with a three-run dinger to left field.
“They were just on Rachel today,” Allard said. “I thought Rachel had her stuff, but they were just outhitting us.”
The Crimson got one back in the fourth, when junior Mari Zumbro drove in sophomore pinch runner Kassy Shiotani with a double to left. But that was as much offense as Harvard could muster against defending Ivy Pitcher of the Year Dalrymple, who finished with 10 strikeouts.
“We didn’t come out attacking her,” Allard said. “I thought we didn’t swing aggressively early in the count. She’s a phenomenal pitcher, and we just need to come out with a tougher attitude.”
The Big Red padded its lead on an Ali Tomlinson single in the sixth inning and extended the advantage to 8-1 in the seventh inning with a pair of runs off junior reliever Julia Moore.
The split puts both squads in control of their respective divisions heading into divisional play, which begins next weekend.
“This was great to come out confident, but since we got beat both [Friday] and [Saturday], we know we can’t just show up and win,” Macadam said. “We know not only are we capable of winning, but we have to beat these teams—and we know we can do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Battling frigid temperatures and strong winds, the Harvard softball team split its doubleheader with Princeton on Friday at Soldiers Field.
With an early scoring outburst, the Crimson (19-11, 5-1 Ivy) cruised past the Tigers (12-16, 3-3), 7-0, in the first game but was unable to hold onto a one-run lead and eventually fell in game two, 3-2.
Sophomore outfielder Stephanie Regan hit her first home run of the season, and junior pitcher Rachel Brown posted another shutout for her 13th win this spring in the first game.
Brown also made a brief appearance in the final inning of game two, increasing her strikeout total to 189 this season but allowing two inherited runners to score.
“I thought we came out very strong in game one,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “But we just kind of coasted for the rest of the day.”
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
Crimson freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone and the defense put forth a strong showing, but Harvard could not hold onto its slim lead, allowing a three-run Princeton comeback in the final inning.
“Laura pitched a great game,” Allard said. “She deserved to win that game, but we let her down.”
Like the first game, the Crimson struck early with freshman infielder Kasey Lange hitting a home run to right center. But Harvard was unable to capitalize on the early lead, going scoreless until the seventh frame.
Ricciardone delivered a solid performance, striking out five batters while allowing only six hits. She was also helped by a stellar defensive effort, which made timely plays—including a couple of highlights—to help remedy for the stagnant offense.
In the top of the fourth, the Tigers’ offense seemed like it was coming to life, with junior infielder Kelsey VandeBergh singling to reach first, and sophomore Alex Peyton coming up to the plate with one out.
Peyton managed to make good contact, but Lange caught the line drive and zipped it to first for a double play.
But the Crimson continued to struggle with the bat, and Princeton was able to turn it on when it mattered.
As the Tigers’ third batter of the inning, Peyton singled to left field, advancing VandeBergh to third and driving in sophomore outfielder Candace Button to tie the game at one apiece.
Harvard brought Brown back to stem Princeton’s momentum, but with no outs in the inning, the Tigers came out swinging.
“They gained some confidence,” Allard said. “[They] swung their bats harder, and that put some runs on the board.”
Princeton doubled twice off of Brown’s first two pitches and jumped out to a 3-1 lead.
Crimson junior infielder Jane Alexander’s solo home run gave the team hopes for a comeback.
But Harvard was unable to escape from the offensive funk, dropping the second encounter, 3-2.
“We were sitting on one run and it’s always tough to maintain a lead when it’s a slim margin,” Brown said. “Laura was doing a fantastic job, but we didn’t make some plays, and Princeton got things going in its favor.”
HARVARD 7, PRINCETON 0
The Crimson lit up the scoreboard in the first two innings—scoring seven runs in two frames—and played tough defense to shut out the Tigers, 7-0.
Brown put in another outstanding performance, striking out 10 of 26 batters while only allowing two hits.
“We came out with a lot of energy,” Brown said. “We were ready to play that game, and it’s a lot easier to pitch when you have a comfortable lead.”
The Tigers’ offense struggled mightily, only managing two hits all game.
Harvard, on the other hand, had no trouble hitting the ball, putting up nine hits, two of which left the yard.
Regan knocked her first home run of the season in the first inning to put Harvard up by one.
Lange also had a strong outing, doubling in the second to bring home Regan and setting up freshman Allison Scott’s three-run homer.
“It took a couple extra rounds of front toss in [our pre-game batting practice],” Lange said. “But I’ve been seeing the ball pretty well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six lefts made two rights for Princeton (12-13, 6-0 Ivy), who beat the Harvard baseball team (3-23, 0-6) in both games on Saturday at O’Donnell Field. The Tigers, who had six left-handed batters, won the pitching battles that were Saturday’s contests.
PRINCETON 3 HARVARD 1
Senior Max Perlman got off to a rocky start on the mound during the second game of the day, walking the first batter and hitting a couple of others in the first and second inning.
The Tigers found home plate first in the third inning. A sacrifice fly ran in a runner at third base, making the score, 1-0.
After the Crimson went three-and-out in the bottom of the third, Perlman stepped up his pitching. In the next three innings, he struck out three batters and allowed only one hit. Because runs were so sparse, Perlman’s pitching delivered in the clutch.
Harvard’s lone run came in the bottom of the fourth. Junior second baseman Jeff Reynolds hit a double to get on base and advanced to third after his teammate grounded out. While Reynolds attentively waited at third, Princeton sophomore Zak Hermans threw a wild pitch that scooted past the catcher. Reynolds capitalized on the opportunity and tied the score, 1-1.
The bottom of the fifth saw unexploited scoring opportunities for Harvard. With two outs and a runner on first, junior J.T. Tomes hit a fly ball between the shortstop and third baseman. The Tigers were unable to communicate, and the two Old Nassau players’ gloves collided, allowing the ball to drop and Tomes to reach first base safely. After another walk, the Crimson loaded the bases.
Senior center fielder Dillon O’Neill stepped up to the plate, but his contact flew straight down the third base line, and Tomes was out at third on a fielder’s choice.
Princeton’s winning runs came in the top of the seventh. Freshman Bobby Geren singled to center field and continued to second after a sacrifice bunt by his teammate. Sophomore Matt Bowman, who pitched the first game, hit a ball to center field that got him to first and Geren to score what ended up being the game-winning run. Bowman advanced to second after the next batter got on base from a hit-by-pitch. A double from junior Sam Mulroy ran Bowman in for the score, putting the Tigers up, 3-1.
With two runners in scoring position, Harvard looked towards its bullpen and brought junior Will Keuper in to relieve.
“The pitch count in the first couple innings kind of caught up with [Perlman] in the seventh,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said.
After the switch to Keuper, the next two batters struck out and grounded out, respectively.
With help from two doubles by freshman Jake McGuiggan, the Crimson was able to get on base in each of the last three innings. But the runners on base were never to any avail, and no Harvard player could find a way to run all of the bases.
“We just never seemed to get that clutch hit, and we didn’t have a chance for a squeeze all game,” Walsh said. “We had that two-run deficit in the ninth, which made it a little bit tougher [to squeeze].”
PRINCETON 5 HARVARD 3
Both teams displayed strong pitching in the first game, but the Crimson struck gold first.
Following a single up the middle from senior shortstop Sean O’Hara in the second inning, junior Marcus Way slammed a homer over the right-field fence. The two-run home run put Harvard on top, 2-0.
The next time the batting order came around, the O’Hara-Way combination struck again. With O’Hara on base, Way hit a double to left-center field that sent his teammate home. Way’s clutch hit and O’Hara’s score in the fourth inning helped the Crimson move ahead even further, 3-0.
Senior Eric “Boomer” Eadington pitched Harvard through the next couple innings, striking out two batters and allowing no runs.
But in the seventh inning, the Tigers attacked. They got a rally going and ended up scoring five runs, the last two of which were a result of a dropped fly ball.
“You have to give them credit,” Keuper said. “They forced us to make good pitches and they capitalized on our mistakes.”
Harvard tried to make a comeback, but the pitching of Princeton’s Bowman, who pitched eight strikes in 11 pitches during the bottom of the ninth, was too strong.
“Bowman came out after they scored five runs and just up-ed it a notch,“ Walsh said.
The Crimson’s losses were hard-fought battles and rough ones to lose, but the players still stay optimistic.
“We can take out of the games that sometimes losing is a good thing,” Keuper said. “It’s been a tough season so far, but I think we can bounce back. I mean, there are a lot of positives: timely hitting, timely pitching. We just need to string them together, and I think we’ve shown that we can do that to ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After breaking its losing streak last weekend against Princeton, the Harvard men’s volleyball team’s woes returned this weekend, as the Crimson (8-13, 0-7 EVIA) lost in two divisional matchups at New York University (18-8, 5-3) and New Jersey Institute of Technology (7-19, 1-6).
“We just wanted to compete and come out with our first divisional victory after we proved last week we could win on the road,” said freshman middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper.
But Harvard failed to accomplish its goal, losing its sixth and seventh consecutive league contests.
NJIT 3, HARVARD 1
NJIT spoiled the Crimson’s final away game, beating Harvard, 3-1 at the Estelle and Zoom Fleisher Athletic Center in Newark, N.J.
In a matchup between the two teams that haven’t been able to secure a victory in the Hay Division, the Crimson and the Highlanders fought to gain some much-needed momentum as their seasons come to a close.
“Both teams went into the game knowing that one would finally be able to get a divisional win, so we knew they were going to be ready for us,” said Rehkemper.
Harvard jumped out to an early lead in the first set, but an 8-2 run by NJIT erased the deficit and provided them with enough momentum to win the set.
The second set was no different. A constant back-and-forth battle between the two teams culminated with a 6-1 run by the Highlanders that again gave them a large enough cushion to attain a second victorious set.
NJIT took yet another lead deep into the third set, but it was the Crimson that was able to put together enough to secure the frame.
Tied 23-23, the Highlanders took a one-point lead, but Harvard battled back, securing two consecutive points to put them up, 25-24.
NJIT tied the game once again at 25-25 with a kill, but two straight kills by the Crimson gave the visitors the set.
But the fourth game belonged to the Highlanders.
Up 14-12, NJIT went on a 5-2 run to secure the final set, 25-17.
“We are a young team, and in this game, we just let the other team go on a few runs that proved to be the difference,” said freshman outside hitter Chris Gibbons.
NYU 3, HARVARD 2
To begin its road trip, Harvard fell to host NYU, 3-2, in the Coles Sports Center of Manhattan, N.Y., on Friday night.
Though both teams started the game off slowly, with errors on both sides of the net, the Violets were able to jump to an early 1-0 lead in the match.
The Crimson battled back in the second set, evening the score at 1-1 with the help of Rehkemper and junior co-captain outside hitter Matt Jones.
“It was such a back-and-forth game because both teams were setting up their attackers with good opportunities for kills,” Rehkemper said.
The two teams battled like this for the rest of the game, with NYU taking the third set to gain the lead. But once again, Jones, Rehkemper, and Harvard took advantage of kill opportunities and evened the score.
In the fifth set, the Violets and their efficient attacks proved to be too much for the Crimson. NYU took the lead and never looked back, winning, 15-11.
“The division is pretty tough all around in…but we can definitely hang with good teams like NYU,” said Gibbons. “We’ve only struggled with finishing games, and I think that will just come with continuing to play together when we come back next season.”
Jones led all attackers with a total of 26 kills for the match, but it wasn’t enough for Harvard to come out victorious.
“[Matt] has really stepped up this season as a leader and has kept us in a lot of tight games,” Rehkemper said. “The team needs consistency, and we can usually count on him for a lot of kills.”
With losses to both the Violets and NJIT, the Crimson continues to struggle to win within the EVIA division. But Harvard has one last chance when it plays the final game of the season against the Highlanders on April 16 at the Malkin Athletic Center.
Despite the struggles this season, the team is optimistic about the future.
“Essentially most of our team is returning next season,” said Gibbons. “This season we have struggled to finish and get wins, but it has also been good for us to gel as a team on and off the court.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In yesterday’s doubleheader against Cornell, the Harvard men’s baseball team achieved its first Ivy League win in spectacular fashion with a walk-off grand slam from junior Marcus Way. The Crimson faltered in the second game though, getting into a double-digit deficit in the second inning.
Harvard (4-24, 1-7 Ivy) entered the four-game weekend hoping to improve its record in the Ivy League but came away with just one win, thanks to Way’s heroic grand slam at the end of the first game against Big Red (4-20, 2-6).
CORNELL 18, HARVARD 5
In the second game of the day, the Big Red built an early lead and didn’t relent.
Cornell opened with a scoreless inning, and the Crimson tallied one run by junior Jeff Reynolds off an RBI by senior Sean O’Hara.
The top of the second inning was one Harvard wished it could get back. The Big Red took advantage of the Crimson’s pitching and a few key errors, scoring 12 runs.
Harvard tried to shake things up after failing to strike out a Cornell player, switching the pitcher twice in the never-ending frame.
“We had a miscue on first base, not covering on a routine ground ball,” said Crimson coach Joe Walsh. “We kicked a couple of balls and basically gave them six outs in an inning.”
After scoring 12 runs off 15 batters and two Harvard errors, the Big Red was up, 12-1, at the close of the second inning.
What Walsh called a “lack of focus and lack of determination” allowed the visitors to get the victory over the Crimson.
The wind was definitely a factor, as several of Cornell’s hits were carried past the fence in fair territory.
“There were fly balls that were out—that was for both teams, but we didn’t put the ball in the air during that inning,” Walsh said.
“They hit a lot out, but they also were hitting the ball on the screws,” Harvard captain Tyler Albright added. “And you’ve got to be able to match that in order to win.”
After the second inning, a home run from Reynolds put the Crimson back on the board, bringing in three runs.
But Reynolds’ standout performance wasn’t enough to make up for the initial deficit.
“We were flat. We let them swing their sticks a little bit, and we just didn’t reciprocate,” Albright said.
By letting Big Red’s Brian Billigen swing his stick too often with six at bats, Harvard suffered two home runs and four RBI off the Cornell junior.
“The second game, we didn’t even show up,” Walsh said, “It’s my most disappointing loss, not only this season, but ever in the Ivy League.”
HARVARD 11, CORNELL 8
After being down to the Big Red going into the seventh inning of yesterday’s first game, the Crimson battled back, scoring six runs late in the matchup to clinch the win.
“It was obviously a very exciting finish, and it was a good comeback by us,” Albright said.
The game had even scoring to start, with four lead changes in the first four innings.
But when Harvard fell behind in the top of the fourth inning, it refused to give up.
In the final inning, the Crimson put on an impressive offensive show to overcome a three-run deficit.
After sophomore Danny Moskovits drove in a run and Cornell’s pitcher walked O’Hara for yet another Harvard score, designated hitter Way stepped up to bat.
With bases loaded, Way hit it out of the park over right field, bringing in four more runs to take the lead and win the game, 11-8.
“At the end, they gave us a chance to come back,” Walsh said.  “We put some pressure on them and got Marcus with the bases loaded.”
Although it was Way’s only hit of the game, it was a hit that mattered.
“We know we are capable of that kind of stuff all year round—clutch hitting in big spots.” Albright said, “It’s very good to see coming out of this ball club.”
The first game of the afternoon marked Crimson quarterback-turned-pitcher Andrew Hatch’s first win on the mound, as well as Harvard’s first league win.
“I wish I had [the first Ivy win of the season] last week, and yesterday as well,” Albright said. “But it’s good to get the first one out of the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team hit the road and traveled to Providence, R.I., following a successful 3-1 homestand that included a six-goal comeback victory against New Hampshire that left the Crimson at .500.
Against Brown (5-5, 1-3 Ivy) last Friday at Stevenson Field, Harvard (5-4, 3-1) managed to make another comeback.
After falling behind, 7-2, the Crimson stole the momentum from Brown thanks to sophomore Danielle Tetreault’s five goals and defensive adjustments, grabbing a 12-9 win.
“We’ve been [making comebacks] a lot lately, I think because we’ve been having some slow starts,” sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “We were not going to lose to Brown because ... every Ivy game we come into with a fight and just refuse to lose.”
Tetreault came out of the gate ready to score.
Two minutes and 19 seconds into the first half, the midfielder put away the first point of the game on a free-position shot.
But the Bears responded with an unassisted goal just over a minute later, as the Harvard quad lacked its usual energy and vigor early in the game.
“We started out slowly, and Brown took advantage of that,” VanderMeulen said. “It’s not an excuse, but getting off the bus, we had a hard time getting started.”
Tetreault kept the Crimson in the game while her teammates livened up. She put Harvard back into the lead at 2-1 with another free-position score at the 4:57 mark.
“Danielle took the team on her back a little bit [Friday],” junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind said. “Especially at the beginning of the game when we weren’t doing well, she just said, ‘Enough is enough, time to start fighting back.’”
But Bears freshman Danielle Mastro countered Tetreault’s two goals with a pair of her own.
And Brown rallied to score four unanswered goals to grab a 7-2 lead, keeping Harvard scoreless for the majority of the half.
This year, the Crimson team has proven itself capable of comebacks and in the final 2:35 of the half, it did just that.
With one less player on the field due to a card, the Crimson racked up three goals as the final seconds of the half ticked away.
The half closed with Harvard trailing, 7-5, but with the momentum in the Crimson’s favor.
During halftime, Harvard altered its defense and returned to the field with a dominate presence on the defensive end. The Bears struggled to shake the aggressive Crimson defense and took only two shots within the first 25 minutes of the second half.
In addition to the defensive adjustment, the Crimson underwent an offensive reform during the break as well.
In the second frame, Harvard—which entered the contest 21st in the country and first in the Ivy League in scoring offense—began to produce offensively.
Over a period of nearly 23 minutes, the Crimson scored seven goals and pushed to a 12-7 lead.
Tetreault continued towards her game-leading total of five goals for the night, notching the first two scores of the second half and tying the game at 7-7.
Just over two minutes later, sophomore Nina Kucharczyk chipped in a point to give Harvard its first lead, 8-7, since five minutes into the game.
“Nina’s incredibly fast and really used her speed to her advantage,” Baskind said. “The more confident she gets, the more goals she’s going to put in for us.”
In the next 10 minutes, VanderMeulen and Baskind completed the Crimson’s 7-0 run. Each player found the back of the net twice, with VanderMeulen’s two scores sandwiching Baskind’s back-to-back set.
Brown put itself back up on the board, scoring twice more in the remainder of the half, but the Crimson lead proved insurmountable when the game concluded, 12-9.
With the victory, Harvard passes the halfway point through the toughest part of its season.
Only two nationally ranked teams are left on the calendar, which was deemed the 14th most difficult schedule in Division I. Still, Harvard looks forward to only more successes and recovery on the horizon.
“We’re dealing with some injuries right now, but looking forward to the rest of our games and having everyone step up and make up for who’s not out there,” Baskind said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard crew, perfection is never far away. And in both teams’ second weekends of racing, the varsity crews finished with clean sweeps over their competition. Only losses on Sunday by the freshman lightweights kept the Crimson from a flawless weekend.
“We definitely put some stuff together,” said junior Austin Meyer, seven seat of the lightweight first varsity eight. “It was all around a really powerful weekend.”
No. 2 LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. No. 4 GEORGETOWN
How much of a difference can two spots in the rankings make?
More than a boat length.
On Princeton’s Lake Carnegie, Harvard had little trouble dispatching the Hoyas’ first and second varsity eights.
“We took a length on Georgetown in the first 500 meters,” Meyer said of the first varsity eight race. “We really shot out and sat on Georgetown and just kind of responded whenever they tried to move, and we were able to pull away.”
The second varsity eight race proved to be a battle not between 2Vs but between the Hoyas’ second varsity eight and Harvard’s third varsity eight. Georgetown was able to beat the 3V by around a boat length.
“The 3V was tenacious,” said Crimson freshman coach Linda Muri. “They raced in that and did a very strong showing.”
Harvard’s only losses of the weekend came in the two freshman races. The 2F raced Georgetown in an eight after racing in fours the day before.
“I thought that was a remarkable performance,” Muri said of the 2F. “They really rolled with the punches all weekend.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. No. 10 PENN
A race originally intended to be a stroke-for-stroke battle turned into a blowout.
Saturday’s race had originally pitted Harvard against No. 3 Cornell and the Quakers, but the Big Red canceled its trip to the Schuylkill for undisclosed reasons.
Penn might be wishing that it too had canceled the trip to its home river, after it was swept by the Crimson.
Not only did Harvard win all of its races, but the Crimson’s second and third varsity eights posted times that were better than those of the Quakers’ first and second varsity eights, respectively.
“We went into the race knowing that we should win,” Meyer said of the first varsity eight race, which his boat won by 8.7 seconds. “We got a strong start and had a nice, cool, relaxed, powerful rhythm.”
The second varsity eight was even more dominant, winning the race by 13.2 seconds.
Arguably the highlight of the day was the first freshman race. After the first freshman eight lost to Delaware two weekends ago, it came back to beat a Penn squad that took down the Blue Hens’ 1F last weekend.
“It was great to see our first freshman [eight] beat a crew that beat a crew that beat them,” Meyer said. “They looked really strong, and I’m looking forward to seeing them improve throughout the season.”
Harvard completed the sweep with a win in the second freshman race. Both of the Crimson’s second freshman fours beat the Quakers’ entry in the race.
No. 3 HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. No. 7 BROWN
In the first race of the weekend, Harvard won all of its races against its rival from Providence in the lone home men’s race of the weekend.
“Overall it was a great show of our depth and the commitment of all our guys—all the guys in the boat club—to have a sweep of Brown, which hasn’t happened in a while,” said junior Nick Jordan, who rowed in the six seat of the first varsity eight.
The first varsity eight opened up the day with a 2.6 second win a year after the Bears dealt the Crimson 1V its only dual loss all season.
“We were sort of jumpy off the start and actually had a really, really fast first 500 and got up to basically a length lead [in the] first 400, 300-400 meters,” Jordan said.
But in the middle 1000 of the race, the Bears were able to push their bow back into Harvard’s hull.
“We took it a little high off the start, and then in the middle of the race, we got a little bit complacent,” Jordan said. “They sort of moved back to a third of a length of overlap, and we sprinted away from them to maybe a full length. It was good to get a win, but we thought we could have put together a better performance, overall.”
The second varsity eight race had no such drama; the Crimson won by almost 12 seconds.
“They just smoked them,” Jordan said. “They just held them off the start and were taking a seat every three strokes, and they didn’t stop the entire race ... That was really fun to watch online.”
The 2V posted the biggest win of the day, while the third varsity eight, freshman eight, and fourth varsity/second freshman eight all defeated their Brown counterparts to ensure the sweep.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to stay undefeated in Ancient Eight play, the Crimson women’s tennis team found its match yesterday at the Beren Tennis Center against Princeton come down to the last set for Harvard junior Samantha Gridley. After she split the first two sets of her match, 6-4, 6-3, both teams lined up to watch the deciding set on the No. 5 court.
“This was the critical set of the day,” junior co-captain Holly Cao said. “We try to support her as much as we can on the sidelines, and by being there, we let her know that the whole team is behind her.”
Gridley struck first, winning the first game, before alternating a loss and win in the next two games to give her a 2-1 lead.
But the Tiger player fought back, winning five straight games to win the match and to secure the overall victory, 4-3.
The loss dropped No. 55 Harvard (8-7, 3-1 Ivy) to third in the Ivy League, as No. 49 Princeton (10-9, 3-2) attained its 10th win of the season.
“Sam Gridley had a really long three-setter to decide the tie, and she fought very hard,” Cao said. “But you can’t win all the time, and we weren’t able to close it out today.”
Having not lost a doubles point in five matches, the Crimson looked in position to once again start the day off with the advantage, holding early leads in each of the three doubles matches.
But the squad quickly lost momentum as the doubles team of Cao and freshman Hannah Morrill lost the first match to finish, 8-4, after being on top, 3-2.
The doubles team of captain Samantha Rosekrans and freshman Natalie Blosser dropped their set soon after, 8-6, after giving up a 4-3 lead. The final pair on court No. 1, sophomores Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton, salvaged Harvard’s only win in doubles play, 9-7.
“We’ve been in the situation [losing the doubles point] before this year,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “We knew our backs were against the wall, but we played well and the matches were very close. They could have gone either way.”
In singles play, Harvard split the six matches, getting three wins from Cao, Norton, and Morrill.
“We had a slow start not getting the doubles point,” Cao said. “But everyone played very hard in the singles matchups.”
Tachibana’s match of the No. 2 court finished first, losing in straight sets, 6-0, 6-3. Norton, who played on the No. 3 court, responded with a victory, 6-2, 7-5.
Morrill, who played on court No. 6, dominated her opponent, winning with back-to-back 6-0 set wins over Tigers junior Alexandra Epps.
“Morrill, Norton, and Cao are all playing very well right now,” Green said. “We have all the tools to keep moving forward in the Ivy League, and it’s all about putting in good work.”
Cao, who lost on Saturday for the first time all season against Penn, was able to bounce back and cap the third Harvard victory in a close match on the No. 1 court, 6-4, 6-3.
“I was pleased with the way I played yesterday,” Cao said. “[Penn freshman Connie Hsu] was a very strong opponent, so I just stuck to my game today [against Princeton junior Hilary Bartlett.]”
With two matches still undecided, attention turned to the matchup on court No. 4, where Blosser had been defeated 6-4 in the first set after going up early, 2-1. Although she looked to come back in the second set, her opponent—Tigers sophomore Monica Chow—was able to close out the match, winning the second set, 6-1.
With the victory on the line, Gridley was the Crimson’s last hope, but she lost her final two sets to close out the day for the team.
“I thought the match was very close,” Green said. “But Princeton outplayed us, and I think we have to do a better job competing on the big points, especially this weekend in our matchup against Yale.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With little wind, temperatures in the upper 50s, and sunshine over the weekend at the Princeton Invitational, the conditions boded well for low scores on the green. But the winds did not blow in the right direction for Harvard, as its men’s golf team finished eighth out of 12 teams.
“The tournament did not go very well for us,” junior captain Tony Grillo said. “We flat out didn’t play well enough to win. It was uninspiring performance.”
The Crimson finished with a score of 894, 46 strokes behind tournament-winner Yale. Harvard was unable to put together three solid rounds of golf in order to come out on top.
The lowest point total for the Crimson was posted by junior Mark Pollak, who led the team with a score of 218 (+5), placing 12th in a field of 68. The tournament winner, Bulldogs freshman Sam Bernstein, shot 208, five under par and 10 strokes ahead of Pollak.
In the first round, Harvard came out relatively strong, as it finished tied for fourth with a total of 295, but a less-than-perfect second round of 305 put the Crimson in a hole that was too deep for it to recover.
“The short game was a problem, especially putting,” Grillo said. “The guys didn’t have a good feel for the holes.”
Par-four holes were tough on Harvard as it recorded a +48 for those holes in the tournament, 10th among the field. Par-three and par-five holes were better for the Crimson as it finished +16 and +3, respectively.
Harvard ended the tournament with the most pars, but it posted no eagles and only 24 birdies. Pollak led the team with 43 pars.
Pollak and freshman Theo Lederhausen were the bright spots in a disappointing showing by the Crimson.  Lederhausen ended up in the 29th spot. He started off strong in the first round with a 72 (+1), but the second round was costly as he finished with a score of 82 (+11).
In the third round, he returned to form with a 70 (-1), putting him at 11 strokes over par for the entire tournament.
“The first and third round, I worked my way around the course better,” Lederhausen said. “I putted much better in those rounds. I had a lot of three-putts in the bad round, and I kept piling on mistakes.”
Other notable competitors for Harvard included Grillo, who finished 37th with a 227, and freshman Seiji Liu, who placed 40th and shot a 228. Sophomore Max Campion rounded out the five team competitors for the team, placing 56th with a 235.
Freshman Michael Lai competed as individual and finished 12 strokes over par, good enough for 30th place.
The Crimson was sixth out of the Ivy teams competing, so it will look to improve before the upcoming Ivy League Championships.
“It was a little disappointing,” Lederhausen said. “We didn’t play that well...We’re preparing for the next two weeks. For a couple of the players, it was the first tournament of the spring. Overall, it was a little disappointing
Yale and Penn were the class of the Ivy League this past weekend. The first- and second-place teams, the Bulldogs and the Quakers both finished 30 strokes ahead of third-place finishers Georgetown and Princeton. The rest of the Ivy League was within 17 strokes of one another.
“For the next two weeks, we’ll see a bunch more Ivy League teams,” Grillo said. “Hopefully, we can play well. We just need to put some rounds together. One guy is usually playing well, but we need everyone to come together and play well for three straight rounds.”
Next week, Harvard will be participating in the Century Intercollegiate tournament at the Century Country Club.
“We’re just trying to forget about this week and play better next week,” Lederhausen said. “We’re just going to keep doing what we’re doing. Hopefully, we pick up speed at the right time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Saturday afternoon’s 13-12 loss to Cornell, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team was unable to swing the momentum in its direction for long enough to hold onto the win.
The Big Red scored the first four goals in the encounter. The visitors maintained possession of the ball for most of the first half, shutting the Crimson out in the first quarter completely.
Most of the scoring came in bunches. After Cornell went up 4-0, junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan put his team on the scoreboard.
The Crimson won the next faceoff, and sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens quickly followed suit, netting his first goal of the game less than two minutes after.
Cornell regained composure with a goal from Rob Pannell, a 2010 First Team All-American and the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year.
But a second goal from Vaughan began Harvard’s second string of scores, which included a second goal from Stevens. After scoring, each team was able to build momentum by winning the following faceoff.
The Crimson dominated the third quarter, scoring six of the eight goals of the frame. In one run, the hosts notched four in a row, thanks to one tally from Vaughan, two from Stevens, and one from sophomore Jack Doyle.
After the run, Harvard was up for the first time in the game, 9-7 with just over four minutes left.
But the Big Red regrouped and answered with three goals. Two back-to-back tallies from Steve Mock in the fourth quarter brought his team back in the lead.
“We couldn’t score goals and then make stops,” said Vaughan about the changing momentum.
Then Harvard scored two, then Cornell scored two. After that, Matt Hull scored to bring the Crimson back into the lead, 10-9.
“The fourth quarter went back and forth,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “They responded, and then we responded.”
Harvard couldn’t hold on. The Big Red’s David Lau scored the tying and the game-winning goal to put the contest away.
“It takes stringing together two big plays,” Vaughan said. “A big hit and a big goal and all of the sudden, you’ve got your momentum back, and kids are fired up on the sideline.”
SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS SHOTS
In a high-scoring game with a heartbreaking ending for Harvard, the Big Red just edged out the Crimson by a goal. But the close score does not reflect the shots taken nor shots on goal for the game. Cornell outshot Harvard, 48-35, for the day.
The unbalanced total was a product of a lopsided first quarter, during which the Big Red outshot the Crimson, 19-7, capitalizing on good passing around the net.
Cornell maintained possession of the ball for the majority of the first quarter, allowing it to get more shots on goal.
Harvard sophomore goalie Harry Krieger had a strong showing in net with 14 total saves, compared to the Big Red’s 11.
For the first time this season, the Crimson was outshot by its opponent.
Even in games where Harvard didn’t come out on top, the squad fired more attempts, often by a difference of nearly 20 shots.
But Cornell’s strong ball protection allowed it to put more shots on the Crimson goal by a wide margin.
TRICKED OUT
Four players, two from each team, scored at least three goals in Saturday afternoon’s game.
Different players for Harvard stepped up as goal scorers. Usually, the team relies on attackers Dean Gibbons and Jeff Cohen, who lead the Crimson with 20 and 22 scores, respectively.
But against the Big Red, Stevens and Vaughan stepped up.
“In the third quarter, our middies’ ability to generate high quality shots…was the difference for us to come back,” Wojick said.
The line of Stevens, Vaughan, and junior Terry White scored a total of seven goals for the day.
Stevens led the team with four tallies in the match.
Vaughan, who scored the hat trick, started three of the Crimson’s scoring streaks for the day.
Cornell’s team was led by Steve Mock’s hat trick and David Lau’s five taliies, including the last two to put his team on top.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 55 Harvard women’s tennis team came out strong in the singles matches to take a commanding 6-1 win over Penn Saturday, when the Crimson (8-6, 3-0 Ivy) defeated the Quakers (6-12, 0-4) at the Beren Tennis Center.
“Penn is a team that you need to take seriously,” junior Sam Gridley said. “They are not one of the top teams in the Ivy League, but they have a number of really good players, so it’s important to not take them lightly.”
The team took two of the three doubles matches to give Harvard a 1-0 team lead.
The double pairs of junior co-captain Holly Cao and freshman Hannah Morrill, and co-captain Samantha Rosekans and freshman Natalie Blosser won their respective matches, 8-5 and 8-2.
The Crimson was unable to match its strong start when its focus moved to singles play.
Cao and sophomore Kristin Norton each fell behind in the first set of their matches, 3-0, while sophomore Hideko Tachibana also found herself down, 3-1.
Norton rallied to pull out the set, 6-4, by winning six out the next seven games against Penn senior Alexa Ely.
“In the first three games, I was going for too much and going for the lines, and I ended up missing a lot,” Norton said. “[Ely] was coming out strong, and then I just planned to keep the ball in and be consistent cross-court, and then she started missing, and I was able to penetrate and come in. I think I played better towards the end [of the first set].”
She kept the streak going into her second set by jumping out to a 5-0 lead.
Norton had some difficulties finishing off her opponent, dropping the next two games before closing out the match, 6-2.
“I though Kristin had an outstanding day today,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “I felt like she was in total control in her match, and I think it was a great way for her to build for the rest of the Ivy season.”
Tachibana came back in the first set to win, 7-5, then proceeded to take the second set, 6-2, which ended up clinching the victory for the Crimson.
Blosser took home another point for Harvard by winning her match, 6-4, 6-4.
Morrill won her match in a tight contest. She dropped the first set, 7-5, but then went on to win the next two sets, 6-0, 10-8.
Gridley got off to a great start in her match. She dominated the first set, winning the sixth game without losing a single point. Gridley smashed a short reply by her opponent to clinch the bagel.
“One of our coaches, Debbie [Goldfine] was on my court,” Gridley said. “She was telling me to have really big targets, be willing to hit as many balls it takes to win every point, and not give away any free points.”
In the second set Gridley had more difficulty, as her opponent freshman Lauren Bridges started being more assertive.
“[Bridges] was being more aggressive in the second set stepping up,” Gridley said. “I tend to hit many high balls, and she was stepping up and taking them on the rise more, and was hitting them flatter. I think that I was also getting more impatient in the second set, trying to finish off points too early and trying to hit flat winners when I wasn’t in position to do so.”
With the set tied at four, Gridley decided to go back to her original game plan before closing out the set, 6-4.
“When it got to 4-all, I just tried to go back to my game plan in the first set and be really consistent,” Gridley said. “Hit the big targets, mix up high balls and low slices to try to force an error out of [Bridges] ... that helped me play more patiently the last two games and close out the set.”
At No. 1 singles Cao ended up losing her match, 7-5, 6-2, resulting in a 6-1 Crimson win.
“I think we came out trying to treat this match like any other Ivy match,” Gridley said. “They are all important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team returned to action this weekend, competing in a pair of invitationals on Saturday.
The Crimson sent its throwing corps down south to compete in the Ole Miss Invitational, while the runners stayed in New England to participate in the George Davis Invitational at UMass Lowell.
“That’s the nature of track and field,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “You’ve got different parts moving in different directions. We pick out different opportunities for our student-athletes to do what they need to do.”
The Crimson’s runners and throwers turned in a number of strong performances, with several event-winning finishes and a few IC4A-qualifying marks.
OLE MISS INVITATIONAL
Harvard’s men’s and women’s throwing squads saw action this weekend in Oxford, Miss. Saretsky was pleased with the performance of his athletes.
“They did a great job,” Saretsky said. “This was a good opportunity to go out of region for warmer weather and some really high-level competition that we don’t usually see. Once again, we had big marks from our throwers. They’ve been the backbone of our team.”
Sophomore Eric Brucker finished third in the shot put with a IC4A-qualifying hurl of 15.86 meters. Freshman Dustin Brode matched his teammate in the event, throwing an identical mark.
But Brucker’s day was not finished when he punched his ticket to the national championship meet in one event.
The sophomore earned fifth place in the discus, with a qualifying throw of 48.27 meters.
What was perhaps the best showing of the weekend for the Crimson came from senior Eric Clayman in the hammer throw.
The senior’s mark of 58.95 meters earned him second in the event, and the attention of his coach.
“[Clayman’s performance] was big,” Saretsky said. “That’s got to be top 25 in the East region.”
Another standout performance came from junior thrower Nick Farnsworth.
Farnsworth’s throw of 63.04 meters gave him a victory in the javelin by almost four meters. His mark on Saturday was 1.5 meters short of his personal record, which stands as the fifth-best javelin throw in school history.
“Nick is two-for-two in the javelin this season,” Saretsky said. “He’s done a great job coming back from an injury.”
Harvard also had an event-winning javelin thrower on the women’s side.
Freshman Hannah Meyer was awarded first place with a toss of 45.10 meters.
Sophomore Shannon Watt had an equally impressive showing at the Ole Miss meet. After taking 10th place in the shot put, Watt finished sixth in the discus, throwing an ECAC-qualifying distance of 44.41 meters.
GEORGE DAVIS INVITATIONAL
While the Crimson’s throwing squad was flexing its muscle at Ole Miss, Harvard’s runners were delivering a solid performance of their own at the George Davis Invitational in Lowell, Mass.
A trio of freshman distance runners was impressive for the Crimson on Saturday.
Kurt Ruegg took third place in the 3000-meter steeplechase with a time of 9:30.18. Classmate Paul Koullick finished the two-mile run in 9:12.66, good for fourth place at the meet. Another freshman, Peter Dolan, finished 11th in a highly contested 800-meter run.
“We’ve got some great young talent that’s developing,” Saretsky said. “This weekend provided them with an opportunity to really see where they’re at and see what they need to work on. It’ll give them some momentum going into the final stretch of the season when it’ll really count.”
The young distance runners were able to shine at the meet in the absence of some of their older teammates. Saretsky held many of the Harvard standouts, including senior Dan Chenoweth and captain Brian Hill, out of competition this weekend so they could train and prepare for next weekend’s invitational at Yale.
“[The team’s older runners] are getting ready for Harvard-Yale next week,” Dolan said. “So it was a good opportunity for us to go out and put down some good marks.”
On the women’s side, a pair of freshman sprinters found success at the George Davis meet. Chelsea Celistan ran a 12.56 in the 100-meter dash, which earned her second place. Classmate Christina Twicken finished third in the 200, crossing the line in 25.25 seconds.
Winning performances came from the Crimson’s 4x100 meter relay team, who finished with a time of 48.90 seconds. Freshman Adrienn LaChance was victorious in the pole vault, with an impressive clearance of 3.50 meters.
Harvard will be back in action next weekend on April 16 in New Haven for the Harvard-Yale Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team has proven this season its ability to rely on its doubles play, winning nine of the last 10 doubles points in dual matches.
But the team’s success in singles play is what gave the squad its edge this weekend.
The Crimson traveled to Penn (12-5, 1-4 Ivy) and Princeton (12-6, 5-0) for two conference duals, facing Penn on Saturday and Princeton yesterday. Harvard (13-9, 2-2) first defeated the Quakers, 5-2, by sweeping five of the six singles matches, but then fell to Princeton, 4-3, despite picking up three singles victories.
NO. 59 PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 3
In one of Harvard’s longest matchups of the year—lasted over five hours—the Tigers narrowly prevailed over the Crimson, 4-3, for the squad’s ninth loss of the season.
“It was a big disappointment, but we fought, and I’m proud of the way the guys fought,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “We had a couple of matches that just didn’t quite go our way today...you couldn’t ask for any more fight.”
The Crimson displayed this fight in the doubles matches, but it lost two of the three to forfeit the doubles point. Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Casey MacMaster and junior Ali Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen both lost their matches, 9-8 and 8-4, respectively.
Harvard had already lost the doubles point, but junior Jon Pearlman and sophomore Josh Tchan earned the squad’s sole doubles win of the weekend with a 9-8 victory.
Moving into the singles matches, Harvard needed four to earn the victory over Princeton, but the team only managed to win three.
Nguyen was the first Crimson player to win, cruising through his match in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
Omodele-Lucien pulled through in three tough sets against the Tigers’ Matt Spindler.
The two traded the opening sets, but Omodele-Lucien rolled though the final set, 6-2.
MacMaster had a much tougher battle on his hands, going to three tiebreakers to decide the match. MacMaster lost the first set but came back in the second and third sets to win, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6.
HARVARD 5, NO. 63 PENN 2
Harvard’s doubles play has usually gotten the squad off to a good start, but the Crimson’s singles play earned the unranked squad a victory against the Quakers. All three pairs dropped tight matches to their opponents to forfeit the first point of the afternoon to Penn.
MacMaster and Omodele-Lucien lost to Eugen Brazdil and Hicham Laalej, 8-4, and Pearlman and Tchan followed with a 9-7 loss to Zach Katz and Ivan Turudic.
Felton and Nguyen pushed their opponents into the tiebreak, but eventually Nikola Kocovic and Mark Milbrandt came out victorious, 13-11, in the breaker for a 9-8 win.
“It was pretty interesting, because after we lost the doubles point, the Penn team was celebrating as if they had already won the match,” Nguyen said. “Coach [Fish] talked to us and said ‘They already think they’ve won,’ and told us that if we fight and do what we need to do, we could win the match.”
Despite the three losses in the doubles matches, Harvard rebounded to win five of six singles matches, three of them in straight sets.
Tchan dropped just four games in total en route to a 6-0, 6-4 victory. Omodele-Lucien battled in two close sets to earn another point for his squad, 6-4, 6-4.
Pearlman and Nguyen also pulled out key victories for the Crimson but needed three sets to do so.
Pearlman’s opponent, Laalej, steamrolled the Harvard No. 1 in the first set, 6-2, but then Pearlman battled back in the second to take it 7-5 and even the match at one set apiece.
Pearlman eventually prevailed in the third set, 6-3.
Similarly, Nguyen dropped the opening set to Jason Lin, 6-4, but he then turned the match around in the second and third sets. Nguyen earned the victory 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
“[After the first set], I figured out that trying to drive the ball through the court wasn’t going to work, because he was getting all of the balls back,” Nguyen said. “I started to hit more angles, and it gave me more room to dictate with my forehand ... I knew I could come back. It was close, and I fought.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe heavyweights and lightweights reached the halfway mark in the dual season last Saturday, as the No. 18 heavyweights (1-3) competed against Ivy foes No. 1 Princeton and No. 13 Cornell in the Class of 1975 Cup, while the No. 4 lightweights (3-0) traveled south to take on Georgetown in the Class of 2004 Cup.
Although both Black and White teams were greeted with perfect weather and ideal rowing conditions—the heavyweights on the Charles and the lightweights on the Potomac River—the crews achieved mixed results.
The Radcliffe lightweights defeated Georgetown to keep the Class of 2004 Cup for the third consecutive season, while the heavyweights suffered losses at the hands of both Princeton and Cornell.
Next weekend, the Black and White lightweights will race on home water against Stanford, while the heavyweights will line up against Syracuse, Ohio State, Dartmouth, Minnesota and Louisville in the Charles River Invitational and the O’Leary Cup.
“Most of these teams that we will be facing are ranked higher than us,” sophomore heavyweight Marisa D’Orsogna said. “They are going to be hard teams to beat, but I think that we have a good chance of fitting right in with them or even standing out.”
NO. 18 RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. NO. 1 PRINCETON/NO. 13 CORNELL
The performance of the heavyweight crew proved to be rather disappointing last Saturday, as the varsity eight, varsity four and third varsity eight crews each placed third in their races, while the second varsity eight placed second.
In the third varsity eight, both the Tigers and Big Red took quick jumps off the line and maintained quick stroke rates to finish in 7:24.9 and 7:29.4, respectively, with Princeton taking the top spot.
The Black and White finished six seconds behind Cornell with a time of 7:35.8.
During the second race of the day, the Radcliffe varsity four took an early lead off the line, but surges by both the Tigers and Big Red in the second half of the race would ultimately leave the Black and White far behind.
At this point, the race became tightly contested between Cornell and Princeton, with the Big Red finishing first with a time of 7:50.3, and Princeton in a close second at 7:51.4. Radcliffe finished in 8:10.3.
But by midday, the Black and White had shaken off its early morning blues.
In the second varsity eight, Radcliffe finished a second ahead of Cornell in 7:04.5 but behind a fast-moving Princeton, which placed first with 6:55.4.
The main event saw the Black and White varsity eight battle hard but finish two seconds short of second place, as Radcliffe again took third behind the Tigers and Big Red.
Princeton took an early commanding lead over both Cornell and the Black and White and never looked back, as the Tigers finished in 6:36.8 to win their third event of the day.
Radcliffe and the Big Red jostled for second place with Radcliffe holding the edge by the halfway mark of the race, but ultimately fell to a late surge by Cornell, its time of 6:48.1 just behind the Big Red’s 6:46.1.
“It was disappointing falling short of Cornell in the [varsity eight],” said Black and White heavyweight captain Olivia Coffey. “It was a really hard fought race, but in the end Cornell just squeezed us out. However, there are really easy technical things that we can fix that can give us a two-second edge in future meets. But it was disappointing losing to Cornell, but they did deserve it.”
NO. 4 RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 5 GEORGETOWN
In the first real test of the dual meet season for the Black and White lightweights, the fourth-ranked squad faced off against No. 5 Georgetown in the Potomac River last Saturday.
Following their final strokes in the water, the Radcliffe lightweights walked away with not only their first trophy of the spring season—as they took home the Class of 2004 cup for the fifth time in the trophy’s seven-year history—but also with their first victory against a top-five opponent this year.
The Black and White took an early lead over the Hoyas and led by a boat length as the two crews reached the 1,000-meter mark.
However, in the closing lengths of the course, Georgetown surged forward to close the gap with Radcliffe, but in the end, the Black and White lightweights proved to be too experienced and strong for the Hoyas.
Radcliffe’s varsity eight finished first with a time of 6:51.0, while Georgetown finished in 6:52.4.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost immediately, one got the feeling this wasn’t a normal exhibition soccer game.
From the Haitian music, vendors, and food at the pregame tailgate, to the drums, horns, dancing, and “olé” chants in the stands once the match began, it was clear from the start that this game meant something more.
Over 11,500 people attended the Harvard men’s soccer team’s exhibition match against the Haitian national team last night. Almost all of them were Haitian-Americans who vocally supported their native country from the start, proudly waving Haitian flags and giving Les Grenadiers a standing ovation when the squad came out for the first time.
It was only fitting that such a contest would come down to the most dramatic of finishes, with the 2007 Caribbean Cup winners pulling away to win 4-1 on penalty kicks after a scoreless 90 minutes in which Harvard outplayed the 99th-ranked team in the world for much of the match.
“The official title of the event is ‘Haiti lève,’ which means ‘Haiti stand up,’” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “The idea for us was to draw national pride, get the Haitian community within the Boston area to come out and support their country, and that’s exactly what happened. So it was absolutely a special environment today.”
After both the Haitian and American national anthems were sung, the game began, and Les Grenadiers outplayed Harvard in the early going.
Haiti had its first good chance to score eight minutes into the match with a corner kick, but an ensuing header sailed wide left. Les Grenadiers had another opportunity soon after when Crimson junior goalie Austin Harms came out to block a header attempt and left the net exposed, but the Harvard defense was able to clear.
The Crimson’s first great look came nearly 28 minutes in when Ben Tsuda had a breakaway, but the junior missed wide left.
Moments later, freshman Kyle Henderson had a wide-open look with no defenders between him and the net. Haitian goalie Peterson Occenat dove and redirected Henderson’s attempt to Harvard junior Jamie Rees, who fired on goal again, but Occenat made another leaping save as the crowd roared in delight.
The fast pace continued a minute later, when Haiti’s Jean Voltaire drilled a shot from 30 yards out, but Harms made a leaping save to keep the game scoreless.
At 33:45, Harvard freshman forward Connor McCarthy made a beautiful move around his defender and got a great look at the goal, but Occenat made a diving save on a ground ball shot. Five minutes later, the rookie took a cross-pass and fired on net, but Occenat made another diving stop.
“I’m in position to make those plays,” McCarthy said. “The team put me in great spots, but I wasn’t coming away with goals today. A lot of the zeros on our part is definitely on my shoulders.”
After a header attempt by Crimson sophomore Richard Smith in extra time sailed wide, the game went into the half scoreless, with Harvard outshooting Haiti 10-4 in the period.
“I thought the backs did a great job,” McCarthy said. “They held a very good team to very few opportunities, and the opportunities they held them to, our goalkeepers did well [to clear out]...The defense was excellent today.”
At halftime, Junot presented a $2,500 donation to Partners in Health on behalf of Harvard Soccer, Friends of Harvard Soccer, and Harvard Athletics, as well as a $2,500 donation to the Haitian Football Federation from Harvard Soccer.
The Crimson was in total control in the more-physical second period, despite not playing any of its seniors or its 2010 leading scorer, sophomore Brian Rogers. But the team could not finish late, despite a myriad of opportunities.
Sophomore Zach Wolfenzon had a chance on a cross-attempt in the 86th minute but couldn’t put it past Occenat, and nobody was on the far side to put it away.
As the crowd got louder, Haiti’s Ricardo Charles attempted to win it with a lefty shot from 35 yards out in the 89th minute, but the ball sailed over the head of Harvard junior goalkeeper Brett Conrad, who had replaced Harms for the second half.
The Crimson then had three good looks during extra time, but couldn’t put the match away.
First, McCarthy got open on a breakaway, but Occenat sprinted out 30 yards to break up his attempt. Then, Harvard freshman Kevin Harrington had a great look and sent a shot right on net, but Occenat lept to his left and deflected it over the goal. Finally, McCarthy broke through once more and had a chance from the side of the goalie box, but Occenat made the block.
“The purpose of our spring soccer is to develop our team,” Junot said. “I think we could’ve been a little bit better on the offensive side of the ball to put the game away.”
The buzzer sounded with no score, so the contest went to penalty kicks to determine the winner.
The first shooter, Haiti’s Junio Clairssainvil, got Conrad diving the wrong way and scored as the crowd erupted, but the Crimson’s Scott Prozeller provided the equalizer.
After Les Grenadiers scored twice more and Occenat denied attempts by Tsuda and Wolfenzon, Haiti’s Jean Baptise lined up as the stadium grew louder in anticipation. Baptise beat Conrad, and the crowd celebrated in jubilation while the Haitian players mobbed Baptise on the field.
Despite not coming away with the win, Harvard players said they were glad to have the opportunity to play in front of the Haitian community that is still recovering from the devastating earthquake of January 2010.
“It was great,” McCarthy said. “[Haiti’s] got real soccer fans. They really appreciate their sport and their country, but I didn’t hear anything negative from them; it was all positive. It was a good experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not every day that you hear as much Haitian Creole at Harvard Stadium as you do English. Yesterday’s friendly between the Harvard men’s soccer and the Haitian national team brought a unique environment to the century-old field.
For one, the game attracted over 11,000 fans, a figure generally reserved for attendance at football games. But most of the people that lined the cement bleachers of the stadium rowdily supported the Caribbean team, and Harvard fans were left in a small and very silent minority.
The Haitian team’s introductions were presented in Haitian Creole, a distinct demonstration of the multiculturalism of the Boston area, which boasts a significant Haitian population.
When the visiting players made their way out of Harvard Stadium’s undersized tunnels and onto the field, the crowd—ready with flags and other national apparel—gave Les Grenadiers a hometown welcome.
Despite the fact that the game was an exhibition, emotions ran high throughout the contest. The crowd came alive anytime Haiti had a chance at a breakaway and cheered anytime a call went against the Crimson.
Even before the game, the path between North Harvard Street and the west entrance of the stadium was lined with vendors selling either national memorabilia or Haitian food. Throughout, long lines kept the makeshift stores busy.
Allston has seldom felt so removed from Harvard. Yesterday, only a smattering of Harvard fans and flags adorning the stadium reminded onlookers that the Crimson was actually the home team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to a report published on ESPN.com, University of Miami officials flew to Boston today in an attempt to woo Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker to the school.
The Miami Herald stated today that Amaker “appears to be UM’s top target.”
The paper reported that the University had made Amaker a five year offer worth $1.1 million per year. The coach had signed a multi-year extension to remain at Harvard in 2010.
On Sunday afternoon, The Herald reported that an announcement on Miami’s new coach could come as early as today.
The paper also listed University of Alabama-Birmingham’s Mike Davis, Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Rob Jeter, Central Florida’s Donnie Jones, Auburn’s Tony Barbee, Murray State’s Billy Kennedy, and Virginia Tech’s Seth Greenberg as other coaches who have been contacted, in addition to Amaker.
Harvard Nichols Family Director of Athletics Bob Scalise could not be reached for comment, and team spokesperson Tim Williamson had no comment.
The Boston Globe’s college sports blog was unable to reach Amaker but stated that “sources at Miami and Harvard said that Amaker was considering what he felt was a serious offer to become the Canes’ next coach.”
The blog added that Amaker was not yet certain of what he was going to do, and that Harvard sources told the paper that though there is no time frame for a decision by the coach, it is possible that a deal could be completed in the next few days.
Amaker has often spoken of his desire to build the Harvard program in the long term and return the Crimson to the NCAA tournament, which it has not made since 1946.
In just four years, he has led a team that was 8-22 in Amaker’s first season into one of the best mid-major teams in the country. With no seniors departing from the squad that won a share of its first-ever Ivy League championship in 2010-11, the Crimson is expected to be the heavy favorite to win the Ivy League next season.
Amaker’s wife, Dr. Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, is also a faculty member of Harvard Medical School.
But the opportunity to return to coaching in the ACC, a Bowl Championship Series conference—where resources for recruiting and athletic facilities are greater—could be a big draw. Amaker has previously coached in the Big 10 as Michigan’s head coach and the Big East as Seton Hall’s head coach, as well as in the ACC as an assistant at Duke.
Miami finished the 2010-11 season with a 21-15 record, including a 6-10 mark in the ACC. Like the Crimson, the Hurricanes earned a bid to the NIT tournament, where they lost in the quarterfinals before head coach Frank Haith was hired by the University of Missouri.

Although Harvard welcomed the Reserve Officers Training Corps back to campus over a month ago, "The O'Reilly Factor" doesn't want to let the issue die.
A recent episode featured producer Jesse Watters visiting Harvard Square and asking some students—and some unaffiliated Cantabrigians—about their thoughts on ROTC.
The program did not to identify the Harvard affiliations of the people they interviewed, but did mention that a bearded man who thinks the CIA crashed planes into the World Trade Center was not a Harvard affiliate. They did not, however, make the same claim about the woman who knew nothing about ROTC, the military, or O'Reilly himself.
The Crimson Editorial Board compiled its own video on ROTC earlier this year, which had quite different takes from Harvard students.
The O'Reilly segment did not mention anything about continued discrimination against transgender people by the military, which has been a major rallying cause for Harvard students opposed to ROTC's return.
