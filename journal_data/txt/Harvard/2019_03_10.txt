After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ghungroo 2019 began with a staticky announcement, as if over an intercom: “Welcome aboard the Ghungroo Express!” Directed by Apurva Kanneganti ’20, Suruchi A. Ramanujan ’20, and Sumhith V. Aradhyula ’20, and produced by Raahul A. Acharya ’20 and Rameen A. Rana ’20, this year’s Ghungroo show transformed the Agassiz Theater stage into a spectacularly vibrant train station. Bright colors and a visually busy set, filled with multi-hued signs for station vendors, filled the air with a bustling, palpable excitement. Every year, Ghungroo, presented by the Harvard South Asian Association, interrogates what it means to be a South Asian American. But this year’s show in particular, which ran Feb. 28 through Mar. 2, was dedicated to the heart of this transpacific experience: diaspora. A train station, both a transitory locus and a site of collision of diverse peoples and cultures, indeed seems a most fitting symbol that — like Ghungroo as a whole this year — cut to the crux of the South Asian American experience.
The show was comprised of a series of musical and dance performances interspersed with independent narrative fragments. The nine skit scenes functioned as standalone comedic acts, yet were inextricably connected: All were humorous explorations of the cultural anxieties and uncertainties of a diasporic Desi experience. The music and dance acts explored this topic as well, examining its central tensions and representing its intense pride and joy. The scenes came together to form an undeniably and uniquely South Asian American production.
Ghungroo’s skit scripts, written by Ajay V. Singh ’21, Dhruv Gupta ’20, Fariba Mahmud ’22, Gaurang Goel ’22, Gopal K. Vashishtha ’19, and Juhee Goyal ’22 were deeply sociopolitically aware at their core. The themes ranged from an exploration of ethnic distance as a result of the generational, geographical, and cultural estrangement of diaspora to humorous criticisms of patriarchal and heteronormative expectations. One skit poked fun at the tired diversity signaling of Harvard administration. An actor playing Dean Khurana, about to attend Priyanka Chopra’s wedding, announced, “It’s gonna be a melting pot of all these cultures and people. It’s gonna be a transformative experience!” Also included was a roast of Mankiw’s spotty attendance record at his own class as well as a parody of Kendall Jenner’s horrifically politically insensitive Pepsi ad. Another skit was an (deservedly) scathing and hilarious criticism of interactions between white teachers and brown students: The scene opened with the character of a white teacher exclaiming, “I’m so excited to teach such an exotic class!” and atrociously butchering the names of South Asian American students while taking attendance. Each skit, with brutal honesty, managed to be unrelentingly funny without needing to filter some of the less pretty baggage that comes with being a diasporic Desi in America, such as the not-so-ideal racism of white teachers.
The dance and musical acts were no less spectacular. The funky “Fusion” dance number, for instance, synthesized Western and South Asian influences into a South Asian American production that its choreographers Adriana Rotaru ’21, Priya P. Kukreja ’21, and Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 likened to ‘Chicken Tikka Masala’ in the program description. From “Fusion” to the “Classical” dance performance of Bharatanatyam, Ghungroo was truly a distinctly South Asian American project. Particularly skillful was the “Percussion Ensemble” of Act 2, performed by Aditya Mahadevan ’20, Akshay Swaminathan ’19, Keshav M. Rastogi ’21, and Nikita Jindal ’22, described in the program as a “unique fusion of instruments from South Asia with Western cajon” and a “conversation of beats to bridge continents.” Each musical and dance performance was an intimate conversation between the two sides of the hyphenated Desi-American identity and coalesced brilliantly into a fully South Asian and fully American, fully South Asian American performance.
Just as the celebration of and pride in South Asian American identity was palpable in the performances, the set was also lovingly built. The cheerful, vibrant wall-mounted decorations crowded against each other, as if vying for the attention of the audience. The stage floor featured a painstakingly-painted geometric mandala design, and a painting of the front of a steam engine formed the backdrop for the set. Colors were beautifully complementary. Costume directors Anagha B. Kumar ’22, Setu Mehta ’21, Sonya Kalara ’21 and Sreya R. Sudireddy ’21 and lighting designers Aditya Mahadevan ’20 and Leena A. Ambady ’20 coordinated color themes of costumes and lighting to create harmonious visuals.
A high energy, captivating production, Ghungroo calcified the ABC’s of the South Asian American experience: “the American-Born Confused Desi” experience, a phrase that has made its way into popular vocabulary and into the Ghungroo program description of the “Fusion” dance. But the show came together with such cohesion and striking beauty that, despite the puzzling paradoxes of the diasporic experience, this Desi production, at least, did not seem confused about the joy, pride, and singularity of a South Asian American subjectivity.

“Documentary Now!” a TV series known for its affectionate parodies of non-fiction films from across time periods and genres, returned to IFC on Feb. 20. The third season’s premiere, a two-part episode called “Batsh*t Valley,” riffs on “Wild Wild Country,” an Emmy-winning 2018 Netflix docu-series about a fanatical commune that overruns a remote Oregon town and invites a large-scale federal investigation into its increasingly suspicious practices. “Batsh*t Valley” is an ambitious endeavor, demonstrative of the show’s maturation since it last aired in 2016.
“Wild Wild Country” garnered attention largely due to the unbelievable nature of the real-life events and themes it chronicled. Beside the façade of a mindful paradise, group leaders engaged in rampant drug abuse, anti-government conspiracy, free love, cult rituals, poisoning, and murder. Because its source material is already so laughably absurd, several scenes in Part 1 of “Batsh*t Valley” highlight and directly quote moments from “Wild Wild Country,” a decision that comes off as too obvious or even a bit uncreative. That being said, Part 2 completely departs from and reinterprets Part 1 (and by extension, “Wild Wild Country”) in a liberated and silly fashion that justifies the relative restraint of the episode’s first half. This strategic pacing, which rewards viewers for their patience, demonstrates a quiet confidence on the part of the show’s writers that is not seen in previous seasons, which utilize a uniform degree of ridiculous humor from start to finish.
“Batsh*t Valley” takes another risk with its cast, which features more established performers rather than the purely comedic actors that usually star in the show. As such, they deliver calmer, more nuanced performances than what fans of previous seasons might expect. Owen Wilson plays Father Ra-Shawbard, a clear caricature of the cult’s leader, Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. Wilson’s signature dopey charm lends itself to an uncanny recreation of Bhagwan’s nonsensical and lethargic yet eerily mesmerizing persona. Michael Keaton has a supporting role as FBI agent Bill Doss, a hybrid of the various law enforcement officers interviewed in “Wild Wild Country.” Most entertaining to watch, however, is the relatively unknown Necar Zadegan, whose feisty and rebellious character of Ra-Sharir (a spoof on Ma Anand Sheela, Bhagwan’s power-grabbing assistant) delivers the episode’s wackiest lines.
Notably absent from the screen are two of the show’s co-creators, “Saturday Night Live” alumni Fred Armisen and Bill Hader, at least one of whom has acted in each of the program’s previous installments. Still, this episode embodies their trademark mix of the real and the bizarre, fitting seamlessly into the canon of “Documentary Now!” “Batsh*t Valley” proves that the show’s formula can continue to evolve while preserving its identity. By incorporating more high-profile actors into its retinue, “Documentary Now!” has the potential to expand its small yet loyal fan base, and to finally enter the mainstream. It’s a fortunate choice — while Armisen will feature prominently in the remainder of the season, Hader will not appear at all due to his starring role on the dark comedy TV series “Barry.”
Most episodes of “Documentary Now!” examine historically significant films like the groundbreaking “Nanook of the North” (1922) and cult classics such as “Grey Gardens” (1975) and “The War Room” (1993). That being said, the show shines most brightly with the episodes that demonstrate Armisen and Hader’s ability to rapidly interpret and satirize the latest documentary trends. In the first season, “DRONEZ: The Hunt for El Chingon” satirized Vice’s over-the-top guerrilla investigative features that dominated online journalism in 2015. The following year, “Juan Likes Rice & Chicken” depicted a distinctly lowbrow counterpart to Netflix’s “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” and early episodes of “Chef’s Table.” The arrival of “Batsh*t Valley” all the more confirms this skill.
In a similar vein, “Wild Wild Country” captured the Internet’s attention for several months after its debut last March due to the unbelievable nature of its story. As streaming services have generated a burgeoning contemporary preoccupation with documentary films and series — Hulu’s and Netflix’ competing Fyre Festival features come to mind — “Documentary Now!” returns from its three-year hiatus positioned to both distill and satirize our cultural zeitgeist better than ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 32, Isabella Boylston — or “Bella,” as her friends like to call her — is an icon of American classical ballet. A principal for the prestigious American Ballet Theater (ABT), she holds one of the most sought-after positions in the ballet world. But between her large social media following and score of individual projects, Boylston is not just a beloved member of the company but a fascinating artist and innovator in her own right. The same ambition that led her to upper echelons of the ballet world brought her, this past semester, to the Harvard Business School’s Crossover into Business program. Pioneered in partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA), the program pairs professional athletes with MBA mentors to help them prepare for a life after their athletic careers. This year, Boylston received the Crossover into Business program’s “championship ring” for top performance throughout the program and on the final exams.
Last Monday, she sat down in a crowded room at the Office of Career Services to eat pizza (one of her favorite foods), accept her new ring, and talk about her journey into the upper echelons of the ballet world — and the boundaries of dance beyond it.
Boylston grew up in Sun Valley, Idaho, a town of only around 1000 people. She caught the ballet bug early: Boylston went to her first summer intensive when she was only 11, and began commuting two hours to study at the Colorado Ballet Academy when she was 12. Her parents were initially concerned about letting her specialize so early, and, as Isabella recounted, would even send her Harvard brochures in the mail in the hopes of encouraging her to pursue a college degree. But ultimately, Boylston’s determination to succeed in the ballet world was unstoppable.
“There was nothing they could have done to dissuade me — they would have had to lock me in a jail cell, I was so determined,” she said.
Once Boylston began to find success as a professional ballerina, she said that one of the biggest challenges she needed to overcome was her relationship with ballet’s heavy criticism culture.
“When I joined ABT, I had both a superiority complex and an inferiority complex at the same time,” she said. “It’s a fine line between having a realistic self-appraisal and being open to criticism and being able to believe in yourself and get out there and give a really stellar performance.”
The personal confidence that led Boylston to a semester at HBS is, Boylston said, not always easy to find in the dance world.
“Ballet is such a hierarchical environment, and, growing up, you’re super deferential,” she said. “You never talk in class.” Many dancers, she explained, are satisfied being in the “corps” — in groups of non-soloist dancers, often performing the same ensemble routines in familiar shows.
The #MeToo movement and the corresponding scandals around several dance company executives, however, have inaugurated a culture shift.
“There are a lot more conversations about women leaders and women choreographers,” Boylston said. “When I joined, that wasn’t so much the case — I never danced work by women choreographers.”
Boylston also talked about the future of ballet as a career and the importance of developing a personal brand — something she’s particularly known for. Her curated image and large social media following have landed her photoshoots and interviews with Self, Elle, Vogue, and Dance Magazine.
“It’s very young and fresh and honest,” Katherine L. Penner ’07, a math preceptor at Harvard and social media manager for Vail Dance Company, said of Boylston’s brand. “There’s a lot of focus these days on projecting a part of yourself that’s somewhat perfect, or perfectly imperfect, and I like that Bella is not as concerned about that. She posts videos that make fun of herself, she posts videos that are things that she’s really proud of — they’re authentic moments in her work day.”
That branding, in many ways, is what has enabled Boylston to connect with her audiences — and to attract a wide range of students to her talk, even those without a ballet background. While many students in the audience listened eagerly for Isabella’s advice on professional ballet careers, others found commonality simply in her ambition and unbridled dedication to what she loved — from former dancers to student athletes.
One such student athlete, Naomi P. Davy ’22, said that though she is not a dancer, she appreciates Boylston’s drive.
“There’s a lot to learn from ballet. Athletically, I understand the pain, the drive, what it takes to keep going. I can relate to that,” Davy said.

We sit around the coffee table like strangers, because we are, in most ways, strangers.
But we are family. I think.
It is not silent because decent conversation can always be made – about the weather, the housing market, the kids. Silence can always be filled.
I watch my grandma sip her tea. I watch the woman beside her shuffle in her seat. I try to catch every family trait they share.
My grandma’s jaw is square; the other woman’s is pointed. My grandma’s eyes are crescent-shaped; the other woman’s are round. My grandma’s nose is small; the other woman’s is wide.
It is the lips, I decide — thin. And they both often smile with their teeth.
***
The family was going to America.
In China, the continual unrest was troubling. To the average peasant, perhaps to anyone, the fighting was confusing and unnecessary. Between the gunshots and the bombs, it was difficult to tell who was trying to kill whom. Death was just death, and violence was simply something to escape. No one wins, everyone loses.
A husband, a mother, two boys, and a baby girl.
Their bags had been packed, and their trek carefully planned.
They were going to America.
One last check, the mother suggests. One last sweep of the room where they once lived, for closure. She passes her husband the girl, tightly bundled in old sheets and clothes, who had just turned three months old.
The woman re-enters the building alone, walking up the familiar set of stairs she had climbed every day for the past ten years. The building had five floors; the family lived on the third.
Their home is now empty. The small kitchen is empty of rich flavors and smells, the bedrooms empty of soft laughter and whispers. They had forgotten to close the window of the living room — not that anyone would care. But for closure’s sake, the mother walks across the room to shut the window.
They hear it. All of them. The husband, the two boys, the girl, and the mother. The bomb was close enough that they felt the shaking.
They see it. All of them. A piece of shrapnel flies through the third-floor window of the five-story building. Through the window that had been left open.
Perhaps they had thought the middle floor was the safest. Above the floods, yet below the bombs.
Perhaps in that moment the husband tells the boys to wait. To crouch down and cover their heads. Or perhaps he knows that these words will mean nothing, that words cannot fill the deafening silence that settles around them as the blast of the bomb reverberates.
Violence can slip through every crevice, fly through any window.
The husband hugs the girl closer to his chest, and runs up the steps of the building.
***
I had supposedly seen the woman beside my grandmother before. Our visit back to China happened to coincide with hers, but I must have been too young to remember. Apparently, when she was younger, she used to go back to China every three years.
My grandma has been to America twice; this is her second time.
The woman beside her lives atop a hill overlooking San Francisco, and she drives everywhere.
My grandma never learned how to drive.
The woman beside her had been teaching Tai Chi in the city and had made quite a name for herself.
My grandma had been a part of the gymnast division of the Chinese military.
I try hard to trace similarities beyond their thin lips.
***
It was a small piece of shrapnel, but it penetrated through the mother’s body. A clean pierce. A bloody mess.
The girl begins to cry in the husband’s arms; he had almost forgotten about the bundle he was carrying.
Perhaps he feels incapable. Perhaps he thinks it would be too much work. Perhaps this is the moment he decides he can only take the boys to America.
***
I stop trying to find the similarities, and instead I marvel at how different their lives had become.
***
The husband goes back to the village to his first wife and his eldest daughter. Everything would still go as planned; he was going to America. He would take his first wife and the boys. His first daughter would come too.
Perhaps this made the most logical sense — he couldn’t possibly raise the children by himself. Perhaps the decision was the product of hushed conversations, midnight mullings, some wine.
He leaves the youngest daughter behind with a neighbor.
***
I marvel at the fact that they are half-sisters, my grandma and the woman beside her.
I watch them both drink tea, their thin lips drawn thinner onto their teacups.
The silence between us is deafening.
I wonder if my grandma feels cheated. Cheated of her chance to grow up with a father, a mother, and the wealth of America. She joined the military when she was eight as a performer. She was a tightrope walker, a dancer, and a magician. She met my grandpa in the military. He was a painter.
Shrapnel. A husband. Two daughters.
To think of all these little moments that create the lives we lead. How different our lives become with every choice that is made.
I marvel at the things not said.
The untold stories floating silently in the air.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS, NEW YORK - The last time these two teams played, Harvard and Columbia went to triple overtime. Tonight, the stakes will be markedly higher, as the Crimson attempt to seal yet another regular season Ivy League Championship. If Harvard can knock off the Lions, or Yale falls to Princeton, the Crimson will be named champion, by virtue of holding the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Bulldogs.
While the Lions are out of contention for the Ivy League Tournament, expect them to come out playing hard on senior night. Columbia has been hot as of late, winning three straight games, including two on the road at Brown and Yale. Tip-off will follow senior night ceremonies here in Morningside Heights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First year guard Tess Sussman dove for a steal, passed the ball to junior point guard Katie Benzan, and sprinted down the court. Benzan looked right and then fired the ball left to a streaking Sussman, who converted a layup to push Harvard’s lead over Columbia to 38-14 midway through the second quarter. The crowd and bench erupted, and Benzan’s no-look pass put an exclamation point on a 69-56 victory over the Lions on senior night at Lavietes Pavilion.
As is the tradition in the last home game of the season, head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith gave starts to all four of the Crimson’s departing seniors, and guards Kelsey Bogdan, Madeline Raster, Nani Redford, and Sydney Skinner responded by giving Harvard (16-11, 9-5 Ivy) a 13-6 lead before the first substitutes came in more than six minutes into the game.
“[I felt] excitement and a feeling of nostalgia,” Skinner said, “but all-in-all just a great feeling and excitement to finish out the season strong.”
The Crimson’s strong first quarter performance was encapsulated by a dominant 18-0 run that lasted over five minutes. After a slow shooting start left Harvard down 6-4 to Columbia (8-19, 4-10), the extended run ensured that there would be no repeat of the first meeting between these teams in Morningside Heights, when an abysmal first quarter left the Crimson down by 20, a deficit they cut into but were unable to completely erase.
Joining Harvard on the bench was Governor Charlie Baker ‘79, who cheered on his alma mater and served as a guest coach for the Crimson on a night in which Delaney-Smith added career win number 601 a night after reaching the landmark 600. 
As would have seemed appropriate on senior night, Raster, Redford, and Skinner all reached double figures in scoring by the middle of the third quarter. Raster ended with a 14-point, 11-rebound double-double, while Skinner led the team with 17 points, 10 of which came in Harvard’s hot shooting first quarter.
“I honestly don’t really even think of the scoring aspect as much as just how well are we all playing together as a team,” Skinner said. “I think we shared the ball — we had a really strong first half. But it was the last home game, I wanted to make my mark as a Harvard women’s basketball player for the last time at Lavietes, and just wanted not to be shy and to be in attack mode.”
While the seniors led the way early on, Benzan provided most of the scoring punch for the Crimson later on. She ended up with 16 points, with 10 coming in a fourth quarter in which the rest of the team was held to just seven points.
“I think Katie Benzan was brilliant down the stretch,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought she showed great poise and leadership.”
Harvard struggled to score after Benzan’s flair gave the Crimson its biggest lead of the night. After shooting 15-of-27 from the field and 6-of-14 from beyond the arc to that point, Harvard slumped to 9-of-40 shooting and 4-of-24 from three for the rest of the game, allowing Columbia to cut the deficit to five points with three minutes left.
“We did not play well the entire second half,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think we got the ball inside very well. We had an unbelievable height advantage but even when we got the ball inside we didn’t do anything good with it.”
The Crimson did just enough defensively, though, to ensure that its lead would shrink no further. Harvard was not quite as stingy as it had been the night before, when the Crimson held Cornell to 38 points in what was its best defensive performance of the season, but in the first half especially it clamped down on Columbia’s best scoring threats. Two months after first year forward Sienna Durr and junior guard Janiya Clemmons combined for 43 points against Harvard, they scored just six in the first half and 20 overall on 8-of-22 shooting on Saturday night.
Aside from being the final home game of the seniors’ Crimson careers, the contest had little significance for either team. Columbia had been eliminated from Ivy League tournament contention while Harvard’s win over Cornell on Friday meant that the Crimson had already locked up the third seed in the tournament heading into Saturday.
“We feel really good,” Skinner said. “Incredibly confident. I’ve had a really great feeling this whole year about how our team’s going to be in the tournament and that feeling has not wavered for one game even though we had some ups and downs this season. I think our team has every weapon we could ask for.”
The tournament begins next Saturday in New Haven, where Harvard will play Penn, against whom they went 1-1 this season, at approximately 8:00. The Crimson will seek to avenge a 57-52 loss to the Quakers in last year’s semifinals, a game in which Penn had the benefit of home-court advantage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NEW YORK —In fitting fashion, the seventh Ivy title in Harvard men’s basketball history was earned through another nerve-wracking, overtime battle.
The Crimson had already played through 20 minutes of extra time this conference season, 15 of those which came against the Columbia Lions in the Feb. 8 triple-overtime classic. Adding five more minutes to the regular season finale only seemed appropriate to a game featuring 15 ties and 13 lead changes — and a season defined by last-minute nailbiters.
Propelled by the individual scoring prowess of junior guard Bryce Aiken — who drilled six triples in a 36-point showcase — as well as three momentum-shifting dunks by sophomore Danilo Djuricic in overtime, Harvard had all but sealed its place atop the Ancient Eight heading into the final seven seconds of the game. Junior wing Justin Bassey was fouled and swished in both of his free throws, giving Harvard a 83-78 lead.
But as is the case across the Ivy League this season, no lead is ever safe.
Columbia sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini sprinted downcourt and knocked in a desperation three to bring the game within two as 2.7 seconds remained on the clock. But Djuricic’s ensuing inbounds to Aiken was mishandled, gifting the Lions one last chance to spoil the party.
And a good chance Columbia had indeed. In what was senior Quinton Adlesh’s final shot of his college career, the three-point specialist rolled to the left corner and briefly escaped the reach of defender Christian Juzang. But his high-arching triple was a tad too strong, nicking off the back iron as the horn sounded. A well-represented Crimson contingency at Columbia’s Levien Gymnasium could finally exhale and rejoice in the victory.
“I’m at a loss of words for what these guys have been able to do to make it happen, after a loss last night [to Cornell] that we were so disappointed in,” Amaker said. “But now to be able to do it, to say we are Ivy League champions again, back-to-back. We’re really proud of what these kids have done.”
Saturday’s win, beyond placing the Crimson at the No. 1 seed in the four-team Ivy tournament and booking a meeting with Penn in the semifinals, also preserved Coach Tommy Amaker’s regular-season-title “winning record”. Over the coach’s 12 seasons in Cambridge, Harvard has either shared or won the Ancient Eight crown outright in seven of those campaigns. The one-time Seton Hall and Michigan coach earned his 400th career win last month and was named the all-time winningest coach in Harvard men’s basketball history in 2016.
“I think when I get a chance to start to look and analyze and reflect a little bit, I think we’ll have a better sense of it,” Amaker said. “But I do feel right now that it does have a special meaning. I don’t know exactly what that really means yet, but I just know how this road has been with this team and injuries and different things that we are fighting in the league. It is very competitive and incredibly hard.”
Outside of Aiken’s offensive output on Saturday night, freshmen Noah Kirkwood and Mason Forbes provided a combined 19 points. The latter first-year in particular energized the Crimson offense at the start of the contest, quickly tallying seven points to push Harvard ahead 15-11 in the opening 10 minutes. Forbes had seen just four minutes of game action in the last two contests, but was clearly in demand in order to combat the Lions’ imposing set of bigs including Patrick Tapé, Randy Brumant, and Ike Nweke.
Nweke in particular gave the Crimson some difficulties defensively in the first frame, reciprocating Forbes’ seven points after similarly coming off the bench around the 13-minute mark. The Lions retook the 21-20 lead five minutes later, but the back-and-forth bout would continue.
Before heading to the locker room, the home side threatened with two runs. The Crimson matched the first 8-0 spurt to level the game back at 33, but saw the second swing linger into the latter half, as the home side gained some traction in the final 1:26 with a triple from Adlesh, a Brumant dunk, and a buzzer-beater layup from Tapé who weaved through the Crimson with less than five seconds remaining on the clock.
Columbia built on its seven-point halftime lead, briefly flirting with a double-digit margin in the opening three minutes. But it was the Crimson’s turn — specifically Aiken’s turn — to uplift the languishing offense. The Randolph, N.J., native knocked down two triples and made a astute dish to Forbes who jammed it in for two, narrowing the Lions lead to one-possession within eight-and-a-half minutes to play. The point guard then drained another triple while drawing the foul to put Harvard ahead for the first time in 15 minutes, and saw an additional trey go down two minutes later.
The Lions regained its momentum, embarking on its own 9-0 run that was capped off by a three from junior Jake Killingsworth with four minutes to play. The scoreboard read 65-59 at that point, but much like the second overtime in the two teams’ prior meeting, Columbia could not close out a late hot streak.
Aiken attacked the basket three times in the next three possessions, scoring twice and finding Lewis inside once. Down 65-67 still approaching the final 20 seconds, the 36-point man attempted to provide a herculean ending himself with one more triple, but this time was rescued by Kirkwood who grabbed the offensive board and was fouled on the follow-through. The freshman calmly converted on both despite losing a bit of vision in his right eye, sending the contest to overtime as Adlesh could not convert on the final triple attempt.
Harvard went 26-of-28 from the free-throw line in the contest, including draining critical shots at the free-throw line late in the contest and in overtime. Outside of the aforementioned three dunks from Djuricic in overtime, a perfect 7-of-7 from the charity stripe in overtime was crucial in the victory.
“Bryce had been telling me to dunk the ball since the last couple of minutes and heading into overtime,” commented Djuricic on his aggressiveness late around the rim. “So that was my mentality, to go up there and go up strong and that’s it.”
Lewis’ two made free throws heading into the final 1:47 gave the Crimson a deceptively-comfortable three-point lead, but the Lions gave one last push with an Adlesh three and two free throws from Maka Ellis with 58 seconds remaining. Down two, it was the corner shooting accuracy of Juzang this time that put the Crimson back ahead by one. Harvard held on tight at the end, but not before those scary last few seconds.
“You just got to stay resilient and rebound and that’s what we did today,” Aiken said. “It was a testament of our character and our team spirit and we buckled down and we got the job done on a tough road gym.”
As the program will slowly process the significance of this win and title, there are more immediate priorities as the team gears up to play the surging Quakers, coming of a win-or-go-home victory over Brown to secure the No. 4 seed. Harvard has swept Penn in the season series, with both games decided within three possessions including an overtime battle.
“We are just coming together at the right time,” Aiken said. “It's a total team effort, 1 to 20, and we just need to buckle down, play defense, get stops, we just grind wins out. It’s March now so it's elimination, win-or-go-home. So whichever way you get the wins we will take it.”
