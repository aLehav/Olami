After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke detailed at a Graduate Student Council meeting last week,University administrators continue to pursue alternatives to shopping week, a longtime staple of the Harvard academic experience in which students are allowed to try out classes without commitment in the first week of the semester before enrolling. At the meeting, Burke floated the possibility of implementing pre-registration for courses that would include digital materials for students to watch in lieu of shopping week.
We are sympathetic to the challenges shopping week poses to faculty and graduate student teaching fellows. For faculty, not knowing the exact size of one’s class until the end of shopping week can be frustrating. For graduate students, the situation may well even worse. Not knowing one’s exact terms of employment until a few weeks into the semester can be a significant source of stress. Nevertheless, due to the overwhelmingly positive effects of shopping week for course enrollees, the University must keep shopping week.
From that perspective, shopping week is one of the best parts of Harvard. Indeed, shopping week epitomizes the ideal of a liberal arts education by allowing students to explore a variety of subject areas. It allows for students to quickly realize what subjects do not interest them, rather than go through the process of formally dropping a course.
Shopping week has allowed students to make thoughtful choices about what classes they are taking. Sitting with a professor and a group of students and experience in an actual classroom gives students a comprehensive understanding of the course — its pace, its social dynamic, its pedagogical style. Particularly in math and language courses, where leveling and pace can significantly impact a student’s ability to learn efficiently and confidently, shopping allows students to pick the option best tailored to their prior skillset.
First-year students would be particularly impacted by the elimination of shopping week. Uninitiated into the informal network of information about instructors and their courses, they would be at a severe disadvantage in selecting courses that fit their interests and needs. Freshmen, above all, are at a prime moment to explore, make mistakes, and try classes that would seem fundamentally out of character, but that could end up engendering Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s famed “transformational experience.”
Eliminating shopping week would also disproportionately harm students who have physical accessibility concerns. Shopping week allows many of these students to work out the logistics of which classes are easier to access, and summarily account for this in course selection.
The replacement Burke proposed to the Graduate Student Council, an early registration system with a “digital” shopping week, would be far less helpful than the current model, as courses’ representations online may not accurately display what it’s actually like to enroll. Even if there are lectures to watch online, there is absolutely no replacement for experiencing a class firsthand.
Moreover, Harvard’s online enrollment platform does not work particularly well even in its relatively minimal role as of now. The platform — my.harvard — is not only frustrating given its frequent loading problems, but it also tends to be rather confusing, providing little guidance on what exactly it means to “add,” “verify,” and “enroll in” a course. Its search function often fails to return the best results, and the site is prone to crashing. Until the University can sort out these technological challenges, we have trouble believing that a full-fledged virtual shopping program will be any more intuitively and efficiently designed.
If the University wants to alleviate the burden of shopping week on graduate students and faculty without completely disregarding undergraduates, it could send out a mandatory survey before shopping week to obtain tentative enrollment numbers. At the very least, this solution — or a comparable intermediate step —should be attempted before throwing out shopping week entirely.
Because of the role shopping week plays in the lives of undergraduates, the administration needs to more widely consult undergraduate students alongside TFs and faculty. Undergraduates not only have strong opinions about this issue, rooted in real experience, but also the ability to think critically about how to design alternative registration models that maintain the best parts of shopping week while easing the stress felt by their TFs.
Shopping week is no doubt a messy system, one that is neither easy nor stress-free, and yet it is precisely this messiness that makes shopping week so rewarding. Every undergraduate seems to have their own story about stumbling into the wrong room and finding a fabulous course, one that may even lead to a concentration. If Harvard wishes to maintain its commitment to the liberal arts, it should first and foremost reaffirm its commitment to shopping week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the debate around the role of “affirmative action” in college admissions, it is worth lingering on the term itself. I think it holds the most central, but too infrequently asked, question in this debate: What should still be affirmed by admissions?
Consider the “affirmative” part of “affirmative action.” In a 1961 executive order, President John F. Kennedy ’40 directed government contractors to “take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.” To “affirm” something is to be proactive in lending it support. In this context, the object of “affirmation” is a disadvantage, a handicap.
In college admissions, there will always be a large number of applicants, many of them more than qualified, vying for a small number of spots in the class. So what impediments to success exist in today’s society that admissions offices should try to help rectify? How do these offices get more of the best candidates from all parts of society into their institutions? What, in short, do they still need to affirm?
One answer is that nothing actually needs affirming anymore. Affirmative action should be illegal because it is simply discrimination.
I don’t find this answer satisfactory, however. Diversity remains a worthy goal, and the status quo of admissions still leaves much to be desired. Higher education, a reliable portal to future success, should take the responsibility of fostering the next generation very seriously. To find the best students to be part of that next generation, from all parts of society and not just the very top, universities will need some type of affirmative action.
Perhaps the most popular answer to my main question is that race still needs to be affirmed.
I also find this answer unconvincing. Its proponents argue that there is still racism in society today. But this argument ignores all the progress made since Kennedy’s 1961 executive order. At some point, all students of all races must fight for admissions on their own, even under non-ideal conditions — because every race is capable of doing so.
Instead, saying that we still need to affirm race also misguidedly implies that some races need special help and reinforces that damaging racial stereotype. In this kind of debate, it is frequently cited that black and Latino students often need much lower SAT scores than white and Asian students to get into elite institutions. Those students are thus tailed by insinuations that they got in just because of their race.
But such insinuations are ridiculous because there are no inferior or superior races, intellectually or otherwise. Why don’t we make the people who would make such disparaging comments see this truth? It seems to me that supporters of race-based affirmative action are almost scared of seeing what will happen if such policies disappear. But the best vote of confidence that one could give to all races in college admissions is to assert that race does not need affirming anymore — that race is not a handicap to one’s chances.
Instead, there is a real handicap that satisfies the question of what remains worth affirming — socioeconomic status. We need to affirm people’s ability to move upwards in society. The class into which people are born should not determine their entire lives. In a time of increasing economic inequality and decreasing mobility, this concept, the American Dream, does need affirming. And for those objectors who would point out that race is often tied to class, as I believe is true, affirming class will still improve racial diversity on the whole.
Socioeconomic status can be a real disadvantage, and there shouldn’t be any shame in acknowledging that. Money makes possible many assets on college applications — private schools, sports teams, academic pursuits, musical pursuits, tutoring, service trips. Who is more impressive: a student whose application is in the, say, 75th percentile because she had to manage extenuating circumstances, such as helping to support her family or teaching herself advanced material because school did not offer enough challenges, or a student whose application is in the 90th percentile because she excelled in a environment catered to her? The answer should easily be the former, because applicants should be judged in respect to their circumstances.
Race is inborn and unchangeable, but socioeconomic status is inborn and changeable. This fundamental difference is why the latter is a more valid concept to affirm.
Picture an admissions evaluation as a ladder. The closer you get to the top, the higher your chance of getting in. By affirming something, college admissions is saying your ceiling is lower than other applicants’ because of it.
Affirming race says you need a boost because your race means you start off lower than others. Well, that seems mildly racist. But affirming socioeconomic status says you need a boost because at your class level, you started off lower than others — which you did. You can also overcome the disadvantage being pointed out. The given boost is a recognition of and investment in your potential, which was demonstrated not simply by how you were born, but by what you managed to do.
Judging affirmative action should ultimately require judging its societal implications. Thus, I think that having no policy is inadequate. But a policy that weighs race heavily is belittling. It is the primarily class-based policy that will be actually affirming, to individual students and to the overall American Dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last April, we, as student workers at Harvard, voted to form the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers. At a time when our democracy is tested every day with attacks on immigrants, slashes to affordable healthcare, normalization of rape culture, and fiercely anti-worker politics, we chose to claim our democratic voice on campus by forming our union. Starting next week, our elected bargaining committee will sit down with the Harvard administration to negotiate our first collective bargaining agreement.
We follow in the footsteps of dining hall workers, custodians, security guards, librarians, and technical workers at Harvard who have secured living wages, affordable healthcare, and protections against discrimination in their union contracts. We also follow in the footsteps of unionized graduate student workers at universities across the country who have won improved individual and family healthcare coverage, support for graduate workers with children, higher compensation, stronger protections for undocumented and international students, and stronger protections against sexual harassment and assault.
Over the summer, the bargaining committee sent out a survey to student workers across the University; thousands of student workers responded, describing top priorities and concerns. In reading over these survey responses, we noticed several common themes. First, even though we study and work at the wealthiest university in the world, our pay rates, benefits and protections do not provide us with security and stability, especially in the face of insecure job markets, rising housing costs, and discriminatory federal policies. Too many student workers struggle to access healthcare, mental health care, and childcare; professional school students face ever-increasing student debt; and Ph.D. stipends have failed to keep up with rapidly rising costs of living. Second, too many women, student workers of color, BGLTQstudent workers, immigrant student workers, and other vulnerable student workers face discrimination, harassment, and demands to do unpaid and extra work. Third, Harvard’s un-democratic and decentralized structure prevents student workers from having their voices heard and their needs met. In too many cases, some student workers are threatened by loss of healthcare, must contend with advisors who create an unhealthy work environment, or cannot access job opportunities even when their funding is contingent on such work. In the status quo, these student workers also lack a clear and reliable channel for addressing these problems.
Based on these surveys, the bargaining committee developed a set of bargaining goals. Our proposed bargaining goals offer material and structural solutions to the problems that student workers face and provide a pathway to building a more just and equitable Harvard. These goals include: stronger protections and recourse against sexual harassment; profiling and discrimination; improved support for student workers with disabilities; improved protections for undocumented, immigrant, and international student workers; fully-paid medical, dental, and vision insurance for all student workers and their dependents; comprehensive mental health care; fully-paid sick and family leave; free or low-cost childcare; increased compensation and work opportunities; an expansion of tuition waivers, financial aid, and loan repayment programs; and lower costs of University-owned housing. The bargaining goals build on the demands that student and worker activists across the University have long articulated and aim to make Harvard a pioneer in higher education. Once HGSU members finish voting on the bargaining goals, we look forward to negotiating a fair contract that will make a difference in the lives of thousands of student workers at Harvard.
The Harvard administration has agreed to bargain in good faith with our union, and we look forward to starting negotiations. Yet, we are frustrated that the administration has already delayed the negotiations by resisting to provide information to the bargaining committee — including information about student worker compensation and healthcare — that would enable us to effectively negotiate over key issues. Winning a strong contract in a timely manner requires a robust bargaining schedule and willingness to share information to facilitate the bargaining process.
The administration’s actions show that we cannot simply wait for Harvard to agree to our goals. Rather, in order to win the strongest possible contract, student workers across the University — as well as student and community supporters — must come together, speak out, and organize around the issues that matter to us. Our success in contract negotiations — and our union democracy — depends on all of us.
On Oct. 15, the bargaining committee will start negotiating with the Harvard administration. On this day, we will celebrate our first day of bargaining with HGSU members as well as student and community supporters.
Let’s show the administration that we are united under our union and we’re ready to bargain for a better Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The head coach of Harvard’s diving program Chris Heaton has resigned days after administrators placed him on leave following allegations that he solicited nude pictures from and sent photos of his penis to young female athletes years ago.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise announced Heaton’s decision to resign in an email sent to Harvard “coaches and staff” Tuesday afternoon.
“Today I share the news that Mr. Heaton has communicated to Harvard that he has decided to step down from his role,” Scalise wrote in the email. “In his place, Tracey Bird will step in as our interim diving coach, effective immediately.”
Scalise added that Harvard will soon launch a “national search for a successor” to Heaton.
Heaton could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.
Harvard hired Heaton in August 2018 — but placed him “on leave” roughly two months later pending a review of allegations of sexual misconduct that surfaced in a class-action lawsuit. The suit, filed Sept. 30 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, alleges that Heaton committed acts of sexual harassment while teaching at the Indiana diving Academy known as Ripfest. It names Heaton, but not as a defendant.
“On numerous occasions… Chris Heaton solicited nude pictures from female athletes at Ripfest,” the suit states. “Heaton sent pictures of his penis to young female athletes.”
Harvard has previously denied it had any knowledge of the accusations detailed in the suit when the school hired Heaton. Scalise reiterated this denial in his email Tuesday.
“As you may know, last week we became aware of allegations concerning our Head Diving Coach,” Scalise wrote. “We take such allegations extremely seriously.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Game just over a month away, Harvard and Yale undergraduates have found a new way to channel the competitive fire it inspires: the Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge, which pits the two institutions against each other to see which college can collect the most pledges to vote.
The challenge, announced on both campuses Tuesday, aims to increase voter turnout by getting students to commit to voting. Harvard Votes Challenge and Yale Votes — a coalition of over 50 student organizations — jointly planned the Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge in an effort that began over the summer.
“Here at Harvard, young people have been really excited about this upcoming election,” Harvard Votes Challenge co-founder Theodore N. Landis ’20 said. “Unsurprisingly, people at Yale were also very excited. We thought it would be really exciting to challenge each other to increase our voter participation rates.”
Landis started talking with Jordan Cozby, president of the Yale College Democrats and an organizer with Yale Votes, while both were in Washington, D.C. for the summer.
Cozby said they drew inspiration from similar initiatives like SoCon Votes, which challenges schools in the Southern Conference to vote.
“Other rival schools have done similar things, so thinking about doing it between Harvard and Yale could be a really excellent idea,” Cozby said.
In 2016, 77.6 percent of Harvard’s undergraduates were registered to vote, and 57.8 percent of students voted in the presidential election, according to the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement. Meanwhile, Yale’s voter registration rate was 79.3 percent, though its actual voting rate came in slightly lower than Harvard’s at 56.7 percent.
However, midterm elections typically see significantly lower turnout. In 2014, the NSLVE reported that the average voting rate across all surveyed institutions was just 18.8 percent.
Given the dismal numbers, the HVC and Yale Votes organizers hoped that putting a competitive spin on pledging to vote would spur students into action, avoiding a similar midterm slump this year.
“There are research studies that have shown that if you commit to vote — whether it’s a paper pledge or an online pledge — and you’re reminded of it about two weeks before the election, then you’re more likely to actually go out and vote,” said Harold Ekeh, a co-founder of Yale Votes and the president of get-out-the-vote initiative Every Vote Counts.
Cozby said the timing worked out well given that students have to get their tickets to the Harvard-Yale game in the month before Election Day.
“I think that the Harvard-Yale Game is one of the most special times of year, because it’s when we really see all Harvard students coming out to show spirit for their school,” Landis said. “This is another opportunity for that spirit to show.”
Ekeh said the winner of the challenge would be the school with the most pledges to vote by Nov. 6. “But the overall measure of how effective this initiative has been will be through the NSLVE report,” Ekeh said.
Ultimately, “the goal is to change the culture around voting to be more of a celebration of this incredible civic duty,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay voiced her support for an early registration system in an interview less than two weeks after the approval of a committee to develop a “shopping week” replacement.
An early registration system would eliminate “shopping week,” the Harvard tradition popular among undergraduates that allows students to try out courses during the first week of the semester before officially enrolling in them.
Instead, under an early registration system, students would register for classes before the start of the semester. Gay said she supports early registration because the system would help achieve her ultimate goal for courses — ensuring they are “pedagogically successful” for students.
Gay noted the difficulty for professors in planning course materials such as syllabi, assignments, and testswhen they don’t know how many people will enroll in their classes.
“What this syllabus, activities, assessments look like in a class with 80 students versus 150 students versus 15 are just different,” Gay said. “It takes time to build a course that makes sense and it's not the sort of thing you can do on the fly.”
Shopping week and the resulting uncertainty in enrollment numbers also poses an issue for professors trying to hire teaching fellows, according to Gay, who taught in the Government and African and African American Studies departments before assuming the role of FAS Dean. Gay said she usually starts working with her TFs well before each semester starts.
“There's a lot of advanced planning that's required,” Gay said. “When you find yourself in a situation where you’ve spent either two straight months working with and training the two TFs you think you’re going to need for your 80 person course and then 150 people show up and you need to find two or three other TFs that you’re just pulling at random from the Law School or the Kennedy School.”
Though some students praise shopping week for the opportunity to try out classes before enrolling, Gay said shopping week is not the best representation of what courses are like for students.
“The thing about shopping is that I think there's a tendency to believe that the information that you gain from attending a first class meeting during shopping week is somehow the highest quality of information that you can get about a course,” Gay said. “When, in fact, the very fact of shopping profoundly changes the dynamics of the class session at that time.”
At its most recent meeting in September, the Faculty Council — FAS’s highest governing body — voted to approve the convening of a committee to draft a proposal for an early registration system. Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh discussed the efforts to assess shopping week at an Undergraduate Council meeting Monday, encouraging undergraduates to weigh in on the issue.
Gay said she hopes the committee will act quickly and present a proposal to the Council by the end of the academic year.
“We've had so many conversations about early registration,” Gay said. “At some point, we just need to say yes or no and move on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said in a recent interview that the UC does not plan to take a public stance on the ongoing lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants —though some Council membersdisagree with that decision.
The suit, brought by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014, is slated to go to trial Oct. 15 in a Boston courthouse. The trial will likely last for several weeks — but many experts say regardless of what the judge rules, the case will likely wind up before the Supreme Court.
The Court’s decision, if it goes against Harvard, could mean the end of affirmative action in the United States. And — following last week’s confirmation of conservative judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the nation’s highest court — that outcome seems more likely than before.
Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination. In the lead-up to the trial, undergraduates, alumni, and more than two dozen campus student groups have spoken out or filed court documents in support of the University. But not the College's student government.
“We’ve been having conversations with people individually and then we also, when the lawsuit first started, we had conversations about it,” Zhang said in an interview last Thursday. “But at this time, I’m not sure if I could say that we plan on doing something.”
Boucher said he wants to ensure students “feel comfortable” expressing their opinions about the lawsuit on campus.
Though the Council will remain neutral, Zhang wrote in a later text that she personally supports Harvard's race-conscious admissions practices.
"I do want to be clear on my personal opinion [which] is unequivocally supportive of affirmative action," she wrote.
Other Council representatives — including multiple members of the body’s executive committee — said in interviews they wish the UC as a body could be equally unequivocal.
“I think it’s important for us to take a stance as UC reps because I think the outcome of this case affects us directly and the student body, in terms of Harvard’s ability to create a diverse student body,” said Victor C. Agbafe ’19, who has served on the Council for three years.
Finance Committee chair Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 agreed with Agbafe. In an emailed statement, he urged the UC to “speak up” to advocate for the merits of Harvard’s current admissions system.
“As an elected representative of the UC and member of the Council's Black Caucus, I find it to be my job — and the job of my fellow representatives — to ensure that, as Harvard admits and enrolls more and more underrepresented minorities, we support them here on campus,” he wrote. “Right now, that means voicing our support of Harvard's admissions process.”
Secretary Rainbow Yeung ’19, however, said she favors neutrality. She argued that the case against Harvard is complex and that the jury is still out on the legality of the College’s admissions practices, meaning the Council should tread carefully.
“Personally, I see… a lot of Asian-American students at Harvard really wanting the College to see us for us and the personal qualities that we can bring to the school, and there certainly shouldn't have any penalties for these students,” she wrote in an email. “I don't know if there are.”
“I think it is difficult for individuals to take a stance on the issue without having all facts laid out in front of them,” Yeung added.
Three UC representatives — Reynolds, Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, and Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20 — have called on the Council to submit an amicus brief to support the University’s race-conscious admissions practices. If the UC chooses not to file a brief on its own, the three representatives said, the body could sign on to a brief some student and alumni groups submitted in August.
“I only just heard of the possibility of submitting an amicus brief, and will be looking into what the UC can do before the case is heard on October 15th,” Huesa wrote in an email.
Though they remainedsilent on the admissions suit during the interview, Zhang and Boucher willingly criticized recent proposals to tax university endowments.
Last December, Congress passed a $1.5 trillion legislative package that included a tax on university endowment returns. Administrators estimate the tax would have cost Harvard over $43 million in fiscal year 2017. More recently, Jay Gonzalez — the democratic nominee for Massachusetts governor — proposed an even larger tax on university endowments that would cost Harvard roughly half a billion dollars each year.
“We need to ensure that there’s funding for education and there’s funding for research,” Boucher said last week. “Any tax system which makes that more difficult by disproprotionately taxing the endowments of universities makes it harder to accomplish those goals at a time when those goals are incredibly important.”
The duo also implored University President Lawrence S. Bacow to maintain current levels of funding for financial aid no matter what happens.
In an interview with The Crimson in late September, Bacow conceded he is still unsure where Harvard will find the money to pay the new endowment tax. But he insisted financial aid is the “last thing” he will cut.
“Diversity of socio-economic status at Harvard is so important,” Zhang said. “A huge strong message from our Council and the undergraduate body as a whole is ‘not financial aid.’”

While Harvard’s return on its endowment marked an improvement from last year’s “disappointing” results, the University’s financial growth continues to lag behind its peer institutions.
This year, Harvard has placed last behind its Ivy League rivals, with Columbia University the only school yet to report its results. The Ivy League schools that have so far reported returns saw an average of 12.2 percent compared to Harvard’s returns, which clocked in at 10 percent.
Princeton leads the pack with 14.2 percent returns for fiscal year 2018, up from last year’s returns of 12.5 percent. Brown University, whose endowment is the smallest in the Ivy League, has so far come in second, with returns of 13.2 percent. Penn, Yale, and Princeton all returned between 12.2 and 12.9 percent.
Harvard Management Company — which oversees the university’s $39.2 billion endowment, the largest in the world — has faced pressure to spur higher growth after a decade of mixed results and frequent leadership turnover.
Last year, Harvard’s returns came in last among Ivy League endowments partly due to a nearly $1 billion markdown in natural resource assets. In a letter written last December, Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. Narvekar called fiscal year 2017’s returns “disappointing.”
Narvekar, who joined HMC as CEO in December 2016, implemented several changes, including linking compensation to overall portfolio performance, slashing HMC’s staff by half, and making money managers responsible for the entire portfolio, as opposed to certain asset classes. HMC recently sold off some of its natural resource assets and spun-off its real estate division.
“As a general measure of how Harvard’s doing, look at a composite performance of Ivy League peers, and Harvard’s closing the gap finally under Narv,” Charles A. Skorina, the head of a finance executive search firm, said.
In his letter to Harvard affiliates last year, Narvekar said that repositioning the endowment to meet performance expectations will take “a number of years.”
But Skorina said sizeable differences between the schools’ endowments make comparing Ivy League endowment returns difficult.
“Each school has a different risk profile. For instance, Yale gets some of their money from endowment, but Harvard gets more,” Skorina said.
For instance, Princeton’s results help the New Jersey-based school fund over half of its yearly operating budget, according to the school’s treasurer report. For 2016-2017, Princeton also anticipated deploying a quarter of its endowment assets towards private equity in 2018.
Harvard has not yet to released a breakdown of endowment assets, though HMC sold some of its private equity assets in 2017.
In an interview last week, Brad R. Balter, a managing partner of Balter Capital Management, said a better indication of HMC’s positional strength may come when growth in assets like private equity, in general, are stagnant.
“When we hit a period when... everything isn’t going up, meaning real estate [and] private equity, which has happened every year for the past eight years, it’s going to be a lot more interesting to see how the endowment performs then, because maybe they are positioned for a less benign environment going forward,” he said.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting immigrants with Temporary Protected Status last Wednesday, giving respite to hundreds of thousands of people around the country and dozens of Harvard affiliates on campus who were facing imminent deportation.
U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled that the administration must continue the program and maintain employment authorizations for TPS recipients from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan. In his ruling, Chen said there is evidence that the administration may have violated the Constitution when it made decisions to terminate the TPS program.
TPS is a designation the U.S. Department of Homeland Security grants to certain foreign nationals who are unable to return to their country of citizenship due to unsafe circumstances like armed conflict or natural disaster.
TPS recipients can legally live and work in the U.S. and are immune from deportation. The status is temporary, but for several years presidential administrations have largely left the program alone, allowing recipients to continue residing legally in the US.
But Chen’s decision comes at a time when the Trump administration is taking action to phase out the status. The judge’s injunction however, took immediate effect, halting the deportation of an estimated 300,000 immigrants living in the United States who were facing deadlines to voluntarily depart the country or risk potential arrest and deportation.
Despite the recent changes, Julio A. Perez, a Harvard staff member with TPS, said he still fears being deported back to his home country of El Salvador. As a preliminary injunction, the ruling only offers a temporary reprieve until further judicial decisions are made or the Trump administration abandons its efforts to end the program.
“The judge’s decision is not the final solution to this problem because the fight is still not over until we get our permanent status to stay here,” Perez said.
Perez added that hundreds and thousands of lives are in danger — and that many in his position are afraid they may have to eventually return to their native countries from which they have “barely escaped catastrophe.”
“I’m scared for my family. I have a son who is 13 years old and I wonder what will happen if we get separated,” Perez said. “Children under 18 are obligated to live with their parents, and my son is a U.S. citizen too, but if they stop TPS then we might have to go back to El Salvador.”
Nevertheless, Perez remains optimistic and said he is grateful for the opportunity he has had to live in safety in the United States for 18 years.
“The ruling was such a nice breath like oxygen to my lungs, and I am confident that people with TPS should not be afraid because we are working hard in the community, but also nationwide, to raise our voices for permanent residency,” Perez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 60 people packed an Emerson Hall lecture room to hear a panel of affirmative action advocates discuss race-conscious admissions in universities Tuesday — six days before Harvard's own affirmative action policy will face a challenge in court.
Harvard College Democrats and the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies co-hosted the panel as part of a Week of Action leading up to the Harvard admissions trial on Oct. 15. The University is facing a legal challenge from anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which alleges that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants. The suit could have national implications for the future of affirmative action.
The panelists at Tuesday's event included Carolyn W. Chou ’13, the Executive Director of Boston’s Asian American Resource Workshop, Andres Castro Samayoa ’10, a professor at the Boston College School of Education, and Jennifer A. Holmes, assistant council at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, as well as Caroline Zheng '19, an undergraduate who filed a written statement in court in Harvard's favor.
The moderator of the panel, Genevieve Bonadies Torres ’08, serves on the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Bonadies Torres kicked offthe evening with a presentation on the history of affirmative action.
Following the historical context, panelists engaged in a discussion that spanned topics includingwhite supremacy, Harvard’s elitism, and how to protect Asian-American applicants to universities without pitting them against other minority groups.
“The model minority myth is a creation of white supremacy,” Chou said during the panel. “I think today about how this case is what’s in the news, but there are Asian American workers who are leading the hotel strikes right now in Boston, in Chicago, in Honolulu. That’s the other story of our communities. It’s not just Harvard students.”
Zheng, the student panelist, said she was “frustrated” with the use of Asian-Americans in the affirmative action debate.
“I’m done with Asian Americans being used as a model minority, as this wedge to drive other minorities apart.” she said.
Some Harvard students who will testify in support of the Collegeattended the panel — including event organizer Sally Chen ’19 and Thang Q. Diep ’19, who has made his admissions file public as part of the lawsuit.
The Emerson Hall room was packed beyond capacity, and latecomers lined the walls once the chairs were taken.
Chen said she was pleased with the turnout.
“We’ve been coordinating with all of the organizations involved here leading up to this big Week of Action,” she said. “I think that the attendance was really good, and that we had a lot of engagement.”
One audience member, Mariana L. De Leon Dominguez ’21, said that she “strongly” supported Harvard’s current policy.
“Going to a college with a diverse student body and a diverse set of classmates benefits us all,” she said.
Tuesday’s panel was part of a weeklong series of events from #DefendDiversity, which will culminate in a rally in Harvard Square on October 14th. Later this week, there will be a poster making session for the rally and a “teach-in” about affirmative action. All events are detailed at diverseharvard.org.
Correction: Oct. 11, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Caroline Zheng '19 will testify on behalf of Harvard in the upcoming admissions trial. In fact, though Zheng filed a written statement in court arguing for the College's race-conscious admissions policies, she most likely will not testify during the trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the weekend, Harvard made the long bus drive to Ithaca, N.Y., to square off against Cornell for the second consecutive year. And for the second consecutive year, the Crimson left the town with its second loss. And for the second consecutive year, Harvard’s two losses come in the first four weeks of play to both the Big Red and Rhode Island.
SLOPPY SPECIAL TEAMS
The Crimson (2-2, 1-1 Ivy) has lost the last two weeks. In each of those games, the spread has been within the number of points that the Harvard special teams has given up.
Last weekend, Cornell (2-2, 1-1) dropped the team 28-24, a win margin of four. The Crimson’s special teams units gave up seven on a punt.
Right at the five minute mark in the second quarter, Harvard set up to punt the ball away. As freshman punter Jon Sot took the snap, his blocking collapsed. The first year sent the ball right into the body of Big Red defender Dylan Otolski. The ball rolled behind Sot and Cornell’s Justin Bedard scooped it up, cradling his cargo as he skipped into the end zone escorted by a squadron of teammates.
The ensuing seven points tied the heading into the half.
Saturday’s second incident involved a kickoff. Following a junior Jake McIntyre field goal, the Crimson’s freshman kicker Jonah Lipel sent the ball back to the Big Red’s David Jones. The home team’s returner fielded the boot in his own end zone and rather than opting for guaranteed possession at the 25-yardline, he sprinting into the mass of Harvard coverage men.
Making a move, Jones found the sideline and beat the rest of the Crimson kickoff team in a 100-yard foot race to the touchdown. Jones threw up his hands and was immediately swarmed by his teammates. The whistles of the referees couldn’t be heard of over the roar of the Cornell home crowd.
However, as the noise died down, the head referee took to the center of the field to announce that the Big Red had held a man. The penalty erased the touchdown and pushed Cornell back 10 yards from the spot of the foul, the Big Red 28-yard line. In effect, the flag negated 82 yards for the home team and erased the six points from the scoreboard.
Last week’s loss wasn’t the first time the special teams unit has cost Harvard some points. In the 23-16 loss to Rhode Island, the unit accounted for nine of the visitors’ total points.
Similarly to this weekend, Sot’s first punt of the night was sent out the back of the end zone on a block. With the safety, the Rams claimed the first points of the contest and the early lead. In the third quarter, Rhode Island scored on a 97-yard kickoff return — unlike Cornell, managing to keep the referees’ flags in their pockets.
“We clearly have a lot of things to improve upon in special teams,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve got some young specialists and it’s a combination of things. We’ll get it figured out.”
Exempting the blocks and returns for touchdowns — which cannot be attributed to the kickers alone, or sometimes at all — the freshmen kickers are actually excelling. For Lipel, against the Big Red he sent every one of his five kickoffs to the end zone.
For punters, excellence is a bit harder to quantify. The most indicative number on Sot’s stat sheet is zero. The freshman has punted exactly zero touchbacks. Anecdotally, when the team needs a long boot the freshman will send it 50 yards. When it needs to pin the opponents, Sot’s punts bounce nearly perfectly within the 20, nearly without fail.
WHO’S THE MAN?
Nearly all of the 2017 season featured the constant question: who will be the starting quarterback? Then-freshman Jake Smith eventually won the job from then-senior Joe Viviano and things were settled. Then Smith was yanked against Yale leading Viviano to take over.
With Viviano’s graduation and another year of maturity under Smith’s belt, the sophomore entered the season has the undisputed starter. Smith as since started all four contests. A wrench was thrown in to that manner of thinking right before halftime this weekend.
With 2:33 remaining in the second quarter, Harvard received a Cornell punt. Unannounced, senior quarterback Tom Stewart took the field in place of the struggling Smith. The drive finished two incomplete passes later on a turnover on downs. Stewart was handed the offensive reins again 28 seconds later only to throw three more incomplete passes and lead the Crimson into the locker room.
After the intermission, Stewart returned and did the only thing he could do: better. On his first drive out of the break, he completed both of his passes — notching a clean 23-yard sprint in the process — with the second toss landing in the hands of senior Adam Scott who took it 30 yards for six.
“We were just struggling to throw the football,” Murphy said. “It wasn’t any one thing, it wasn’t all on the quarterback but we we’re just — statistically and otherwise — we weren’t really a balanced offense in the first half. At that point, we kind of had nothing to lose. We have a senior that we felt like can throw the ball...and Tom really responded.”
When the final whistle blew, Stewart had completed seven of his 23 attempts for 100 yards and two touchdowns. Smith, prior to his exit, managed to complete three of his 11 tosses, for 37 yards. Perhaps a little bit of drama has been introduced into the quarterback position yet again.
ONE FOR THE BOOKS
While the team lost, two players managed to collect personal record breaking performances: junior kicker Jake McIntyre and sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin. McIntyre broke his personal record first.
McIntyre has been a mainstay for the Harvard offense all season, particularly in the last two weeks. The junior has made six of his seven field goal attempts and every one his extra point tries. In total, McIntyre’s foot has accounted for 27 Crimson points this season. That’s over one fourth of the team’s total points coming from a player that can only score one and three points at a time.
Against Rhode Island, he sent all three kicks through the uprights, successfully keeping Harvard in the game when the offense couldn’t find its way into the end zone. In Ithaca this weekend, he booted his career long. Lining up from 42 yards, McIntyre gave the Crimson the 17-14 lead with the clean boot through the uprights.
“He’s an amazing kid,” Murphy said. “He’s so incredibly consistent that we sort of just assume it’s going to happen. His level of excellence is just amazing. That kid’s going to go a long way in life because that’s how he does everything. It’s just how he is.”
Shampklin is another one of Harvard’s players that can boast quite a few of his own points. This weekend was no different. In the opening drive, Shampklin busted free and ran untouched 47 yards to six points. For a moment, things looked to be trending in the direction of another San Diego-style blowout. They weren’t. Still, Shampklin managed a career high.
“[It was the] same as week one, same as week two, same as this week,” Shampklin said. “The o-line, just doing their job, always blocking. I just have to be patient, wait to see the holes and as soon as I see them, I just have to hit them. Everybody’s blocking so it makes it easier on me.”
The second-year rushed for 191 yards on the afternoon, notching 27 carries. The lone touchdown was Shampklin’s fifth on the season, the most of any of the backs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team entered Tuesday night’s matchup against Boston University with the chance to make it one full month since last conceding a goal. Even against a potent Terriers attack that had scored in five consecutive contests, the Crimson defense held strong for nearly 89 minutes.
With only 1:07 remaining in the second half, however, BU broke through. A well-placed corner by Terriers sophomore forward Anna Heilferty came down just a few feet in front of the goal, and after deflecting off several players, trickled across the line. Just like that, Harvard’s streak of 478 minutes without allowing a goal ended.
Having seized the momentum, BU went on to dominate the run of play in the first overtime period and ultimately found the winner in the 96th minute, when freshman forward Lauren Adelman drilled the ball home following another corner.
The golden goal pushed the visiting Terriers’ win streak to five, and BU (6-7-2, 4-0-1 Patriot) now returns to conference play with its momentum further bolstered by the comeback victory. The Crimson (5-5-1, 2-0-1 Ivy), on the other hand, still holds on to its undefeated conference record but must find a way to respond quickly as it hits the road for three straight away games beginning Saturday.
“It was a difficult way to lose a game, of course, but we can take a lot of positives from the way we played against a very good side,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We’ll go back and assess what happened in the last few minutes there and make sure they’re sorted out before we go back into Ivy play.”
Both sides had the chance to shake up their lineups for Tuesday’s clash, as younger players gained valuable experience while spelling the usual starters. The Terriers made eight changes to their starting lineup from last Friday against Navy, while Harvard made six changes to its lineup from last Saturday against Cornell.
Despite rotating out its goalkeeper and two center backs, the Crimson kept BU off the scoresheet for nearly the full 90 minutes. Sophomores Chamberlain Mathis and Cammie Dopke got the starts at the heart of the home side’s back line, while junior Kat Hess returned between the posts.
Hess played perhaps her best game in a Crimson uniform, collecting eight saves while holding the opposition scoreless over 55 minutes of play. The total doubled her previous career high of four saves, which she recorded last season against Seton Hall.
“We had players making their college debuts today, players trying out new positions,” Hamblin said. “A lot of people stepped up to put us in the position we were in near the end, and that’s a credit to the strong culture on this team.”
On the other side of the pitch, Harvard’s offensive output was defined by a goal from a direct corner by senior midfielder and talisman Leah Mohammadi. Her strike in the 12th minute was her first goal from a direct corner this year, after she collected two such goals last season, and also brought her total for the season up to a team-high six tallies.
“I’ve been trying to make sure that my corners are more consistent, with the spin and getting them closer to the goal,” Mohammadi said. “I felt pretty good about my first one [corner] in terms of location, so I decided to just go for it, hit it a little harder towards the back post, and luckily it worked.”
Adelman turned out to be the only other recorded goalscorer in the matchup when she provided the winner in the 96th minute. Her goal was assisted by junior Ann Marie Jaworski and freshman Lily Perryman, who tallied the first points of her college career.
Tuesday’s contest also marked the collegiate debuts of two Crimson freshmen, Elizabeth Saoud and Margaret Cote. Saoud recorded 18 minutes of game time for the home side, while Cote recorded 12, both in midfield roles.
“I think we had a strong game overall, even though we’re definitely disappointed about the loss,” Mohammadi said. “But we’ll make sure to use it as motivation to get better as we go back to playing Ivy league games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s rugby dominated Quinnipiac for the second time this season on Saturday with a 24-21 win. The Bobcats scored twice late in the game — one try with 14 minutes left and the other with only a minute left — but the Crimson (3-1) maintained its composure and was able to hold Quinnipiac (2-3) off for its third victory of the season.
“Obviously at the end when things like that happen, we have to keep our composure,” Harvard freshman Sofie Fella said. “One of the things we’ve been working on is managing to stay calm and composed but still keeping that intensity and fire.”
The intensity and fire was high for Harvard right of the bat and was maintained throughout the entire game. The Crimson kept possession and pushed the Bobcats to their defensive side for the first ten minutes, but a breakaway sprint by Quinnipiac freshman fullback Allison Koenig resulted in the first try of the game. However, Harvard senior Caitlin Weigel immediately responded with a try, and senior Jenny Kronish’s conversion points were good to tie the game 7-7. After another long offensive possession, Harvard junior Robyn Beese muscled through the pack for another try, pushing the Crimson to a 14-7 lead at the half.
The first frame consisted of many great Harvard defensive plays. Coming off a tough loss to Dartmouth, it was clear to Harvard that its defense needed to see significant improvements to seal a win against Quinnipiac. The defensive tone was set early with multiple important tackles and forced turnovers.
“The times we kept them off was really impressive,” Beese said. “We felt like a completely different team out there compared to our last game against Dartmouth.”
Harvard ended the first half with all of the momentum and did not let that go with the start of the second. The lead extended with another Crimson try within the first few minutes of the second half, when Fella sprinted through all of the Quinnipiac defenders. Unfortunately, the placement of Fella’s touch when she scored proved to be a tough angle for Kronish, and Harvard could not clutch the conversion points. The same sequence of events occurred about ten minutes later when senior Grace Chao pushed through the Bobcats’ defense for the last Harvard try of the game, but the Crimson failed to seal the conversion points.
Immediately following the Harvard try, there was an amazing breakaway sprint by Harvard senior Susie Clements, but Quinnipiac was finally able to get a stop and punt the ball to safety. Following this defensive feat, the Bobcats were able to get the ball in the end zone to tighten up their deficit to 24-14. For a few minutes, it looked like Quinnipiac might have gained back the momentum and were going to make a push for a comeback.
“It’s so easy for us to get frantic in that situation because it’s nearing the end of the game,”Robyn Beese said. “[But] for us to keep our heads on like connect with each other and encourage each other every scrum I think just showed our mental toughness and our mental edge over the game today.”
Ultimately, it was the improved Harvard defense that continued to come up with one stop after another, and were able to hold Quinnipiac off for the majority of the second half. Harvard senior Caitlin Weigel came up big with a great defensive stop and got the ball out of Harvard’s end zone with about eight minutes left after a long offensive push by the Bobcats.
Ultimately, with one minute left, Quinnipiac scored again, but at that point the game was almost certainly going to end with Harvard on top.
For Fella, what stood out most to her was not that she extended her streak of consecutive tries to four games — it was the performance of the walk-ons.
“[The walk-ons] all did really well for their first ever rugby game.” Beese added.“[They were] the people who were able to adjust and really put a competitive edge on this game.”

With Harvard’s Sleep 101 module inspiring countless memes, it’s clear that many think Harvard needs to work on how it talks to its students about the issue of sleep (in addition to not sending out reminder emails about the module at midnight). Here are some sleep tips that you can use without having Ariana Huffington tell you that caffeine affects your sleep schedule for 45 minutes.
Early To Bed, Early To Rise
On nights where you have to work, don’t stay up until 4 a.m. Unless you’re nocturnal, there’s no way you can be very productive at that time of night. Instead of waking up right before class, go to bed early and wake up early instead. Trust us, you’ll be far more productive.
The All-Nighter
On nights where you do have to pull an all-nighter to write a paper, you’re going to be tired the next day — that’s a given. The day after, do the bare minimum of work (whatever is immediately due the next day) and go to sleep in the early evening. If you’re desperate for sleep, go to bed as soon as possible and do the work the morning of if at all possible. Your body needs to recover after an all-nighter, and if you don’t let it, you can build up sleep debt. This will only make you more unproductive and unfocused as the week goes on, so you want to get rest as soon as possible. You may have more work to do since you didn’t do any the night after the all-nighter, but you’ll be able to do it far more efficiently without the sleep debt weighing you down.
Shut Down Your Laptop
If you’re anything like me, you fall asleep with your laptop in front of your face all the time. It turns out that this can actually mess with your sleep. So, when you feel drowsy in bed, turn off that laptop before you head to bed.
Take Naps (But Not For Too Long)
Have an hour and 15 minutes between two classes? Run home (or go to a library) and take a nap! But don’t take one for too long. 20-minute naps are best for you to feel refreshed and ready to work afterwards. Any longer and you’ll wake up feeling even more tired than before.
