After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Content Warning: This op-ed deals with discussions of sexual assault and harassment.
A couple of weeks ago, The Editorial Board published a piece about student safety on Harvard’s campus. After arguing last Fall that Harvard Yard should close its gates after 10 p.m. to improve the safety of its student population, this year, the Board offered a differing opinion, arguing that the real threat lies inside — as opposed to outside — the gates of Harvard Yard. We argued that fearing non-Harvard Cambridge residents unfairly depicts them as “as an alien menace” and retracted our previous position on locking the gates at night. Ever since we opined on this topic, I’ve thought a lot about the reality of danger in Cambridge  and how it differs from popular notions of safety in the city.
Cambridge is not “dangerous,” and yet I call my parents for moral support when I have to walk back from Lamont to my dorm room alone at 2 a.m. Cambridge is not “dangerous,” yet I hold my breath and pick up my walking pace when I get cat-called on the street.
If Cambridge is not dangerous, why is it scary to navigate it all alone in the dark of night?
Because it feels dangerous – not just for me, but for many women. Recent research shows that women’s perception of their personal safety at night greatly differs from men’s. While about 20 percent of men felt unsafe walking in a busy public space at night, almost 50 percent of women felt unsafe walking in the same type of environment. This discrepancy in perceptions of personal safety did not change in a differing environment either. While almost 40 percent of men felt unsafe walking in a park or another open space at night, a little over 80 percent of women felt unsafe walking in that same environment. This variation in experience by gender suggests that this is a burden most heavily felt by women. This doesn’t come as surprising as nearly 99 percent of perpetrators of sexual misconduct are men. It’s no wonder then that men feel overwhelmingly more safe alone at night than women.
The problem here is that women are holding the burden of fear while they shouldn’t have to. Instead, we should be restructuring the way in which our society holds perpetrators of sexual misconduct – which are almost always men – accountable for their actions. We are in need of a stark cultural shift – one that places the burden upon men to simply be better people.
In the aftermath of sexual misconduct, it shouldn’t be so hard for our society to believe women when they come forward and say that they’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted. The courage it takes to share their story is not always so easily developed. And it’s easy to see why. Once women share such vulnerable, terrifying experiences they’ve endured, they aren’t always believed — especially when the person who may have harassed or assaulted them is a well-known and well-liked public figure. While movements such as #MeToo have done a lot to help dismantle the culture of victim blaming as it demonstrated the wide extent to which sexual misconduct has affected women, there is still a cultural hesitancy to believe women.
And, even worse? There seems to be a legal hesitancy as well. Research has shown that only 2 percent of perpetrators of rape  are convicted and imprisoned. Sexual misconduct is a hard thing to prove in the court of law. When you couple that with societal norms in a patriarchal system, it is no wonder that it proves difficult to try cases of sexual assault and harassment.
Considering the high likelihood that a previous perpetrator of sexual misconduct may be wandering our campus or the greater area plus the fact that victims of sexual misconduct overwhelmingly tend to be women, it is no wonder that it is women who are holding the burden of fear when navigating their day-to-day lives. This is a problem that is everywhere – both within Harvard’s gates and beyond them. Just because the public safety numbers on a report may make Cambridge seem “safe” does not mean that it feels that way. And the Editorial Board has no right to suggest otherwise.
Navigating a still slightly unknown city without fear is a privilege — one that usually isn’t afforded to students who identify as women or are femme-presenting. Being fearful of the Cambridge community is not unbridled alarmism, as the Editorial Board puts it, but a genuine fear that is rooted in the mass amount of violence seen against women. To say that it is anything other than that demonstrates privilege. A privilege to not have to be fearful. While I recognize that Cambridge is considered the “second safest city” in the country, if anything, the fact that there is a lack of perceived personal safety should serve as an indication that there is something seriously wrong with our society and our world. In order to correct this, we’re going to have to take a good hard look at how we talk about sexual misconduct and where we place the blame for its occurrence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pro-Israel and Jewish students on this campus are staring down the barrel of antisemitism — quite literally.
The Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee has invited a speaker into our community who once tweeted “God rid us of the Zionists,” a statement that we find obviously incendiary as proud Zionists on this campus.
Palestinian writer and poet Mohammed El-Kurd is slated to speak at an event this Monday, titled “Confronting State Violence: Divestment & Youth Activism,” which is being co-sponsored by the Harvard Law School Middle Eastern Law Students Association, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, and Harvard Kennedy School’s Palestine Caucus, and will focus on the movement to boycott and divest from Israel.
Digging through El-Kurd’s work surfaces numerous instances of language we were taught in our Jewish day schools was antisemitic. Consider his poetry collection “Rifqa,” in which El-Kurd seems to reference the Israeli state, writing that “they harvest organs of the martyred, feed their warriors our own.” These lines evoke an antisemitic playbook dating back to the Middle Ages, in which Jews are accused of murdering Christian children and baking their Passover matzah with the children’s blood.
El-Kurd has also tweeted, seemingly in reference to Israeli security forces, that he “hate[s] these pigs” and “hope[s] every one of them dies in the most torturous & slow ways. I hope that they see their mothers suffering (not that these conscienceless pigs would care).” He also equates the Israeli government’s practices with those of the Nazis in the Holocaust, a baseless comparison that the U.S. State Department explicitly deems antisemitic.
At times, El-Kurd has seemed to condone violence against the Jewish state outright. He praised the “martyrs” of the Second Intifada, an uprising that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians, both Palestinian and Israeli. He has excused the actions of Hamas, which include launching rockets at innocent people in populated areas, while claiming that Israel has no right to defend itself against the terrorists whose actions he dismisses.
One of us was present in Jerusalem in May 2021, when Hamas fired rockets at Israel’s capital, and had to seek cover in a bomb shelter with his elderly relatives for several minutes until the attack was over. Given that harrowing experience, we cannot help but find El-Kurd’s tweets callous at best.
El-Kurd has even defended a USC student government representative who wanted to “kill every motherf****** zionist.”
If this does not qualify as hateful, then what does?
As Zionists, whose connection to the land of Israel plays an integral role in our Jewish identity, who proudly sing “Next year in Jerusalem” every year at our Passover Seder, who view the Jewish return to Israel as the realization of the dreams of generations of our forebears, we are pained to see a speaker come to our campus who seems to support violence in opposition to a core part of our identity.
Harvard already has an antisemitism problem. Just this past year, many Jews were horrified to hear allegations by Government Professor Eric M. Nelson ’99 that a swastika symbol had been found in Currier House. They were disgusted to see imagery reminiscent of the Holocaust painted on a bizarre display in Harvard Yard that seemed to tacitly equate Zionism with Nazism. They were disturbed when this very newspaper’s Editorial Board endorsed the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel movement, a cause that many American Jews consider to be either mostly antisemitic or to have some antisemitic supporters. And they were scared when they discovered an online interactive map that documented the locations of dozens of Boston Jewish organizations in what feels like an apparent “how-to” guide for the hate-crime-curious.
Now, hosting a speaker on this campus who seemingly flirts with antisemitism — especially one who has appeared to endorse the use of violence in some cases — makes Jewish students feel even less safe.
We know what happens when we allow public, antisemitic calls for violence. For one of us, it resulted in his family being murdered in the Holocaust. For the other, it led a gunman to commit a shooting in his majority-Jewish hometown, forcing him to pull his elderly grandparents away from the roar of bullets he was sure were coming their way. We Jews, personal victims of antisemitic attacks, can’t help but wonder: Why would a campus event be any different?
By inviting El-Kurd, the PSC has demonstrated what appears to be a disturbing degree of carelessness and flippancy about antisemitism. We believe they should invite speakers whose views are constructive and lead to dialogue, not those who lead to Jewish students feeling unsafe. When an individual engages in hateful and incendiary behavior, we all have the obligation to speak out, or, at the very least, not invite them into our community.
Harvard must send a strong message to its students by condemning El-Kurd ahead of his speech. They must also carefully review whether the PSC violated any student organization guidelines by providing a platform for El-Kurd to promote his views, which we find abhorrent. To our peers, we ask that you not attend an event featuring a speaker whose language has displayed antisemitic undertones and seemingly exhibited comfort with violence.
We are dismayed to see our peers bring El-Kurd to speak to our campus. We find their willingness to invite such a noxious figure into our midst appalling. Thou shalt not stand idly by.

Entrepreneur and philanthropist Hansjörg Wyss gifted Harvard $350 million to support the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the University announced Thursday.
The donation marks the fourth gift from Wyss, building upon his initial $125 million gift that founded the Institute in 2008 and his subsequent gifts of $125 million in 2013 and $131 million in 2019. Laboratories within the Wyss Institute seek to develop new technologies in healthcare and sustainability, and its Advanced Technology and Business Development teams apply those innovations to the market through startups and corporate partnerships.
Originally from Switzerland, Wyss made his fortune by founding Synthes USA, a medical research and design company. Wyss has also donated to many of Harvard’s schools, including the Harvard Business School, where he helped strengthen the school’s doctoral programs.
The Wyss Institute has developed a number of groundbreaking biomedical technologies, according to its press release, including “high-value therapeutics, diagnostics, medtech materials and devices, and novel sustainability technologies.” Wyss Institute faculty collaborate with researchers from across Harvard schools and work with 12 collaborating academic institutions and hospitals in the Boston-Cambridge area and around the world.
“The Wyss Institute has brought together scientists, clinicians, business innovators, and other visionaries to develop and commercialize technologies that benefit public health and protect our planet,” University Provost and Wyss Institute board chair Alan M. Garber ’76 said in the press release.
Since 2009, Wyss Institute faculty and their research teams have produced almost 4,000 patent filings, more than 100 licensing agreements, and 50 startups.
“Since its founding 13 years ago, the Wyss Institute has been devoted to breaking down silos within and between academia and industry,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release.
“That aspiration, expressed passionately and persistently by Hansjörg Wyss, has yielded a unique model of collaborative and cross-disciplinary research, as well as disruptive innovations that are improving and savings lives,” Bacow added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub reopened this month after its doors were shut for more than two-and-a-half years due to the pandemic, hosting 50-cent wing Wednesdays, trivia, and karaoke nights.
Queen’s Head Pub opened in 2007 as an on-campus social space for students. Located in the Loker Commons under Annenberg Hall, Harvard’s freshman dining hall, the pub was named after the Queen’s Head tavern in England, left to the University by John Harvard, which burned down in 1876.
Zach L. Tripsas, manager of the Queen’s Head Pub, said the reopening process was lengthy but worthwhile.
“We’ve had to go through a lot of processes to open it up such as making sure it's deep cleaned, hiring a full new staff, setting up a calendar of events and things that we can host in the space,” Tripsas said. “It's a bit of an undertaking, but well worth it.”
Since opening, the pub has seen around 100 people each night, reaching its capacity of 200 occupants a few times, according to Tripsas.
David Verbat, a fourth-year Chemistry graduate student from the Netherlands, said it was a “bummer” when the pub closed for Covid-19.
“It’s just an easy place to get out after work with your colleagues,” he said. “It was a bummer when they closed for COVID, and then they just never reopened for two whole years, which was quite a long time.”
As the general manager, Tripsas said his role is to guide student staff members in the process of creating menus, hosting events, and other aspects of the business.
“This really is a space for and by students. That was the case from its inception, and that's going to be the case moving forward,” he said. “I really want to encourage the student community in the space and encourage their own creativity in that regard as well.”
Harvard Extension School student Delilah Brown said working as a graduate manager at Queen Head’s Pub is an “amazing” experience, adding that the staff is like a “little family.”
“We're just having fun and vibing and getting the job done,” Brown said.
“I noticed a lot of older grad students are coming in more, and I would like to see the undergrad students come in a little bit more and have fun,” she added.
Sarah O’Connor, a Cambridge resident who has been going to Queen’s Head for several years, said the location is a “good Friday night social spot.”
“I'm waiting for the 1636 beer to come back,” she said, referring to a Harpoon Brewery ale the pub previously sold. “It's like a dark ale, but it's quite tasty.”
Harvard Graduate School of Design student Ethan J. Chan said the pub is “hidden but nice.”
“I didn't know about it for my first year and a half here,” he said “It's kind of surprising, but I'm glad it's here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana praised new mental health initiatives launched by the University and Counseling and Mental Health Service this fall in a Friday interview.
This month, Harvard rolled out a campus-wide mental health awareness campaign following recommendations from Harvard’s Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health, convened in 2019 by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
In addition, CAMHS announced on Oct. 5 it would provide students with access to a new virtual counseling and well-being platform. Some students have previously criticized CAMHS wait times, which last semester reached around six weeks for an initial appointment due to increased demand and clinician turnover.
“While nobody has a perfect solution, I’m really grateful that we are rolling out so many new initiatives, which I think should help both strengthen the view that mental health is part of well-being and also increase opportunities for accessing the potential help people need,” Khurana said.
For the second year in a row, Harvard students organized a display of 1,000 backpacks in Harvard Yard in September. The display, which Khurana described as “very moving and powerful,” represents the annual toll of college student suicide in the United States.
“It was a poignant reminder that while I think we made progress in destigmatizing mental health, not everybody has easy access to it,” he said.
Khurana called on Harvard affiliates to “role model” asking for help and to share their stories with others.
“Seeking help is a sign of strength,” he said. “I think talking about it and sharing one’s own story or struggles can be beneficial.”
Khurana also discussed the following topics:
Midterm Elections
Looking ahead to midterm elections on Nov. 8, Khurana encouraged students to vote and educate themselves on political issues. He cited the work of the Harvard Votes Challenge in encouraging increased voter registration.
“We always encourage students to be engaged and to vote. That's an important exercise of democratic responsibility. We’ve tried to make it as easy as possible for students to get absentee ballots,” Khurana said. “This is a critical responsibility for those who are voting in US elections.”
Khurana noted that some students may have “frustration about whether one vote matters” but highlighted the importance of civic engagement.
“Often many elections are much closer than people realize. Votes do matter, and they are expressions of interest and expressions of hopes and directions,” Khurana said. “Ultimately, the best political leaders end up being leaders for all the people that they’re representing, not just the group that voted for them.”
Nobel Laureates
Two Harvard College alums were awarded Nobel Prizes in early October. Carolyn R. Bertozzi ’88 received the prize “for the development of click chemistry and bioorthogonal chemistry” on Oct. 5, and former Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke ’75 was one of three recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economics.
Khurana said he was “over the moon” upon learning of the College alums who are now Nobel Laureates.
“The experiences [Bertozzi] had and the people she worked with, it really just spoke to what we’re trying to create for every student,” Khurana said. “To have them authentically pursue the things that they care about, to have that transformative experience in relationships and the subjects they study and through their peers,” he added.

Convening for its weekly general meeting Sunday, the Harvard Undergraduate Association voted to allocate $2,700 toward the Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition to support its demonstrations at the Supreme Court later this month.
The allocation was the first to make use of the Association’s new “HUA Helps” grant program, which was established at the same meeting. HAAC plans to hold demonstrations in support of Harvard’s race-conscious admission policies when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in an anti-affirmative action lawsuit brought against the University later this month.
HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 opened the meeting with updates regarding the Association’s new “Social Life Fund,” which aims to subsidize accessible social events for undergraduates, such as those organized by House Committees.
HUA Social Life Team officer John S. Cooke ’25 encouraged students to apply to the grant even if their event may fall short of the program’s 500-attendee requirement.
“I fully recommend that everyone applies,” Cooke said. “We can work with you to help plan it and hopefully mold it into something that can get huge.”
Finance Team officer Alexander J. Zurovec ’25 announced the body had received $81,628.06 in funding requests from 55 student organizations this month, but was only able to disperse $22,500.
Johnson stressed that, despite receiving its largest-ever budget allocation this year, club funding would remain frugal, citing a large uptick in the number of clubs applying for grants. According to the Extracurriculars Team, the HUA is currently reviewing 59 new student organization applications.
“We always hear from clubs about clubs not getting enough money,” Johnson said at the meeting. “If 59 new student orgs are approved, that's 59 more student orgs that are pulling from that budget.”
Moving into new project proposals, the HUA unanimously voted to adopt a new club onboarding process for the spring that would include sessions and workshops to guide new student organization leaders.
The Well-Being Team also proposed an “HUA Helps” initiative, which would earmark $6,000 of HUA funding to support students “hosting workshops, events, protests, and rallies.” The presentation cited meals and materials such as “posters and megaphones” as potential expenses.
Well-Being Team officer Hana Rehman ’25 said an official set of guidelines around the grant is pending, but all allocations would be approved by an HUA-wide vote at the weekly general meetings. The body adopted the initiative with 13 votes in favor and two members voting “unopposed.”
Immediately after the program was approved, it received its first request.
The Affirmative Action Coalition, a group of Harvard student organization leaders working to support affirmative action at Harvard, requested $2,700 to subsidize meals for a group of 90 students attending demonstrations at the Supreme Court later this month.
HAAC leaders Shruthi S. Kumar ’24, Angie Shin ’23, and David E. Lewis ’24 said the group acquired funding for transportation and lodging through other sources, including the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, but meal subsidies had yet to be covered. Estabine and Johnson expressed their support for HAAC’s request before the vote.
HAAC’s funding request passed, with 14 students voting in favor and one student voting against. Kumar, Shin, and Tatum all cast votes in favor.
Under the HUA’s constitution, only Finance Team members are required to recuse themselves from votes in which they have a stake.
Corrections: October 24, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the minimum number of attendees for an event to be subsidized by the Harvard Undergraduate Association's “Social Life Fund”  is 700. In fact, it is 500.
A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the members of the Harvard Affirmative Action Coalition who spoke at Sunday's Harvard Undergraduate Association meeting.

Hundreds of thousands of spectators lined the Charles River to cheer on the 57th Head of the Charles Regatta from Friday to Sunday.
Roughly 11,000 athletes participated in the weekend of racing. Booths lined the bank of the Charles River selling memorabilia, food, and drinks.
Lux Hogan-Murphy ’26, who attended the regatta on Saturday, said she felt “grateful” to be at the event.
“Leaves were falling, the people were smiling, spirits were high,” she said.
Despite rainy weather on Sunday, Grace Seifu ’24 said she appreciated the atmosphere of the Regatta due to the positive energy displayed by the athletes.
“The people on the teams really love each other,” Seifu said. “They really work hard, and they love what they do. And I think that says a lot about the sport and also the type of people that it attracts.”
Luna V. Pham ’24, a spectator who was a coxswain on Harvard’s rowing team last year, described the rowers as “angelic.”
She reflected on her personal experience with the team, recalling how stressful it was to train for the competition and how that stress seemed to dissipate once a race began.
“You don't think about anything except getting the best strokes in and just being able to make it to the finish line,” Pham said. “It’s like all of your stresses are gone and you just wanna do the best that you could for the race.”
Michael Cataldo, a clothing vendor at the event, launched his new brand Doodle Dog Apparel at the regatta on Saturday. He said his experience was “unbelievable” and “overwhelming,” noting that he sold twice as much merchandise as he was expecting.
“We want to be here where the consumers hang out,” Cataldo said. “It's a lot of excitement, a lot of positivity. And, you know, those are the kinds of experiences people like to remember.”
The Regatta held a special significance for Ukrainian fan Robert Orest Kulewicz. This year marked the first time that the Ukrainian national team competed at the Head of the Charles.
“You can imagine the challenges that they have, right? They have to train outside of their country,” Kulewicz said about the Ukrainian athletes. “They have the stress of waking up every day and trying to understand where their friends and family are, but they came out here and they did the best they could.”
Wesleyan University rower Nelson Bellows said “there is nothing quite like racing the Head of the Charles.” Bellows wrote in a text message that the city of Boston coming together for the annual regatta creates a unique atmosphere.
“Amidst the crashes, stress, and confusion, the opportunity for great fun is presented to thousands of young athletes,” Bellows wrote.

A coalition of Cambridge-area activists rallied against police violence and mass incarceration during a protest in front of Cambridge City Hall on Saturday.
The protest, organized by The Black Response Cambridge, a police abolition advocacy group, was held in honor of the National Day of Protest Against Police Brutality.
Local activists Andrew King and Mike Prince guided the event, occasionally leading demonstrators in chants, including “Ain’t no power like the power of the people ’cause the power of the people don’t stop.”
Boston area musicians Sassy D’estany and Terry Borderline performed songs at the protest, with D’estany kicking off the event with a rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”
Stephanie Guirand, a member of the Black Response who was one of the event’s principal organizers, said during her opening remarks that city-led community safety reform efforts — such as Cambridge’s proposed Community Safety Department — are not a true alternative to policing.
“We may hear that the city is creating its own department, but what’s the difference between sending police with guns and police without them?” Guirand said. “We need to send people with different tools entirely.”
Lana Habash, a pro-Palestine organizer, listed names of victims of police brutality and Palestinians killed in Israel, pointing to commonalities between the police abolitionist and Palestinian liberation movements.
“The Palestinian struggle is inherently abolitionist,” Habash said. “We stand with Black, Indigenous, and people of color on this continent in their rejection of police and prisons as an assault on the life and liberation of BIPOC people.”
Later in the evening, Guirand criticized the Cambridge Police Department’s use of ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology implemented by the city in 2014, saying it disproportionately targets low-income neighborhoods.
“Those of us who live in the Port, you may get a lot of ShotSpotter reports,” Guirand said. “They’re actually concentrated in certain neighborhoods — in low-income neighborhoods around the city, around the projects — where there’s a great majority of people of color.”
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email Sunday that ShotSpotter has been an effective tool for the city’s policing efforts.
“The sensors have been deployed in areas that have historically had the highest incidents of gunfire,” Warnick wrote. “In addition to being a valuable investigative tool, ShotSpotter has proven to be effective in detecting gunshot incidents that were not reported by residents.”
Among the event’s speakers was Kazi Toure, a member of the prison abolitionist National Jericho Movement. During his remarks, Toure decried U.S. police forces as “the fruit of a poisonous tree.”
“They come from the slave plantation,” Toure said. “They are the court system, they are the judges, district attorneys. They’re all part of the police, they’re all part of the same thing.”
Toure was convicted in 1987 for his role in plotting a series of bombings with the United Freedom Front, a Marxist organization that the FBI classified as a domestic terror group.
Derrick Washington, who is incarcerated, wrote a letter that was read by organizers of the event. Washington is the founder of the Emancipation Initiative, a group that aims to end life-without-parole prison sentences, restore voting rights in Massachusetts, and establish universal prisoner suffrage across the nation.
“Disapproving is fine, but it comes a time when the mangling and the murdering of us has to disappear — it has to stop,” Washington wrote in the letter, read aloud by one of the speakers to the toll of City Hall’s bells.
Two local politicians also spoke at the protest — Somerville City Councilor Willie Burnley Jr. and Cambridge City Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan.
Zondervan, the final speaker at the event, sponsored a policy order in 2021 requesting that Cambridge consider funding the Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, a non-police public safety alternative developed by the Black Response.
Zondervan said funding HEART is a “top priority” for the council, adding that he has raised the issue with Cambridge’s new City Manager, Yi-An Huang.
Zondervan ended his speech by urging attendees to vote.
“Speak out,” Zondervan said. “Speak truth to power, vote, and let us know what you need and what you want and what you deserve.”

For the third time in four years, the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee has launched a campaign urging undergraduates to boycott Harvard College Israel Trek, an annual subsidized spring break trip to Israel and the West Bank.
Some PSC publications decry Israel Trek as a trip that “whitewashes the crimes of a racist, settler colonial state that dehumanizes and kills Palestinians each day.” The language has drawn public criticism from some pro-Israel students over upperclassman house emailing lists and on posters across campus.
Joshua D. Willcox ’23-’24, an organizer with PSC, which calls for Harvard to divest holdings connected to Israel’s presence in Palestine, said the campaign’s goal is to “increase the awareness on this campus that Palestinians live under an apartheid regime.”
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called Israel’s treatment of Palestinians a form of apartheid.
“To go on a trip, which has a very clear political motivation, and to not decide to be aware of that — and even if those people who are aware of it but decide for themselves that ‘it's a free trip, I can just go on it, I won't be involved in anything’ — is to deny what people on the ground have been calling for, what Palestinians have been calling for,” Willcox said.
Israel Trek student leader Ty L. Geri ’23 said the PSC’s criticism of the trip was “not necessarily surprising” but said Israel Trek aims to engage with a variety of perspectives by including diverse political figures in its itinerary.
“Reducing people to conflict and to hate is dehumanizing, and I think that when you’re thousands of miles away, it’s easy to dehumanize people. But when you’re there, it’s much harder,” Geri said. “We’ll always get some criticism, but we’ll always continue engaging in open dialogue.”
Members of Harvard Hillel and the Harvard Israel Initiative have denounced the PSC’s campaign. Critics of the boycott have hung pro-Israel flyers encouraging students to hear from “Israelis and Palestinians who are pro-solutions” next to the PSC’s posters around campus.
Rebecca S. Araten ’23, a Harvard Israel Initiative leader, said the boycott is “shutting down a conversation” and “completely misreading what is actually happening on the ground.”
“Those words — extreme things that aren’t based at all in fact — are being thrown around to prevent people from going,” said Araten, a former Crimson News editor. “The reality is that if people actually go on this trip, they’ll realize that those words — those terms — are not at all representative of what is actually happening in Israeli society.”
In 2019, the PSC circulated a petition calling on undergraduates to boycott Israel Trek, which was ultimately canceled due to Covid-19. In February, the PSC called for a boycott of Israel Trek, which ran unfettered over spring break.
Harvard Hillel’s student president, Natalie L. Kahn ’23, said the PSC’s boycott is an attempt to “disregard any possibility of dialogue.”
“You’ll see these posters up all around campus saying, ‘your trip is free, Palestine isn’t,’ and all these other catchy phrases, but they’re not really encouraging nuance in any way,” said Kahn, a Crimson News editor. “If people really looked at the agenda, the itinerary of the Israel Trek trip, they would see that it really does try to balance both sides.”
PSC organizer Shraddha Joshi ’24 countered the allegation that PSC prevents dialogue, citing conversations the organization has hosted.
“One of the biggest sources of pushback was that we were rejecting dialogue, whereas in reality, all PSC can really concretely do in this space — aside from encouraging people to boycott — is to create spaces for productive dialogue,” Joshi said.
PSC leaders held office hours in Claverly Hall on Wednesday evening to answer questions from students regarding the boycott. PSC members publicized the office hours through house emailing lists, which drew criticism from some students.
Alexander L. S. “Alex” Bernat ’25, who replied all to a PSC email sent over the Lowell House emailing list to criticize what he deemed “aggressive and false rhetoric,” said in an interview that “any action that singles out Israel” is anti-semitic.
PSC organizers say that argument represents a deflection.
“The argument of singling something out only just deflects from the wider issues and tries to distract from the fact that we have a very strong reason to be standing up for this cause because we are very much part of the issue itself,” Joshi said.
An exchange in the Dunster House email list led to intervention from the house’s faculty deans, who affirmed in a housewide email that they “reject prejudice of all kinds, including Islamophobia and antisemitism.”
Joshi said criticism of the boycott comes “from a perspective that aims to minimize the work that PSC is doing.”
“While there is criticism surrounding the language that we’re using — surrounding the semantics — in the end, we’re just trying to do what we can to undo some of the complicity that we have as Harvard students,” Joshi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of psychology and sociology experts discussed how psychedelics can be used as therapy for racial trauma at an event hosted Thursday by Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
The event, which was co-sponsored by the Chacruna Institute for Psychedelic Plant Medicines — a non-profit seeking to normalize the use of psychedelics in health care systems — featured University of Memphis sociology instructor Darron T. Smith and clinical psychologist Joseph R. McCowan. The discussion was moderated by NiCole T. Buchanan, an associate professor of psychology at Michigan State University and a Chacruna Institute board member.
The panelists discussed how the history of medical racism and the War on Drugs has affected Black Americans’ perception of psychedelics.
“When I consider the three words that people see when they’re coming into our work — it’s psychedelic, therapy, research,” McCowan said. “It’s a trifecta in terms of stigmatization. Research, psychedelics, and you have therapy, which are all highly stigmatized for people of color.”
Smith added that there is a long history of racism in psychedelic research in the U.S.
“That history is very, very fresh and palpable, so I think a lot of that history — the long intergenerational memory we have of all these kinds of abuses up to current — still lingers,” Smith said.
McCowan and Smith are currently researching how MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, could be used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder by reducing fear response.
PTSD symptoms — such as hyper-vigilance, avoidance, and negative thinking — overlap with symptoms of racial trauma, McCowan said.
“There’s almost like a direct line, in some ways, to beginning to take a look at supporting people of color with psychedelic or MDMA-assisted therapy with racial trauma,” he said.
“I have a vision for a field that’s reoriented to prioritize the needs of people who are not currently accessing treatment, and who are currently unaware of these available treatments — and it’s often those who need treatment the most,” he added.
If authorized for treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, expected as soon as 2023, the panelists said MDMA would need to be combined with other types of therapy.
McCowan said having more therapists of color will be important to increasing equity in psychedelic treatment.
“In therapy, especially psychedelic therapy, there’s a heightened degree of sensitivity. Sometimes during that experience, we don’t see people that look like us,” McCowan said.
“We need therapists that can relate, and we need clients able to feel like they can relate to the therapy process,” he added. “The movements for social justice and the psychedelic renaissance — we really must see that they’re not separate, but intertwined.”
The Petrie-Flom Center is set to hold three more panels on psychedelics this semester with the Chacruna Institute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs hosted Patrick O. Cohrs, a professor of international history at the University of Florence, to discuss modern international politics Thursday.
Cohr spoke about his new book, “The New Atlantic Order: The Transformation of International Politics, 1860-1933,” at the virtual event. In his book, Cohrs identifies the 1919 Paris Peace Conference as a pivotal moment in the transition between European imperial powers to states governed by rights and laws.
Cohr’s book is the first in a two-volume set which will eventually cover events through 2020, including the Second World War and the Cold War.
“This system that emerges has a certain durability and longevity and legitimacy, because it is actually the product of negotiations,” Cohrs said in an interview.
During the discussion, Cohrs argued that the state-oriented international system that emerged after the Paris Peace Conference is interlinked with a democratization of international politics.
“To create such orders is not just something for a few statesmen or stateswomen operating, you know, at the height of international politics,” Cohrs said. “It involves wider societies, it involves informed citizens and students.”
Cohrs said he hopes the new book sparks discussion about international history among people from many backgrounds.
“It’s written for, let’s say, people who are really interested in the topic, but also for a more general audience that wants to delve in and understand more about this kind of war and peacemaking in modern history,” Cohrs said.
Cohrs added that finishing the first book was not easy, especially as it was originally intended to be a single volume.
In order to describe the Paris Peace Conference as “just the beginning of a longer reorientation and transformation process,” Cohrs said he needed to add a second book.
Combining the book’s broader historical claims with the intricate events and characters involved was another challenge, he said.
“It's like a gigantic chess game of writing, where you have many perspectives and everything influences the other parts,” Cohrs said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court justices from Mexico and Colombia, Alfredo Guitérrez Oritz Mena and Natalia Ángel Cabo, discussed abortion rights in their respective countries at a panel hosted on Friday by the Petrie-Flom Center at Harvard Law School.
The forum comes four months after the United States Supreme Court stripped away constitutional protections for abortion, overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.
The panelists discussed decisions issued by the Supreme Courts of both Mexico and Colombia in the last two years that expanded abortion access. In September 2021, the Supreme Court in Mexico ruled in September 2021 that it is unconstitutional to punish abortion as a crime. Colombia’s top court issued a ruling in February that legalized abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.
“It’s been a very, very, very long road to where we got last year,” Oritz Mena said.
Oritz Mena said the story of a 13-year-old rape victim who was pressured not to have an abortion, despite receiving permission from a local district attorney, has long influenced the abortion debate in Mexico.
“This was an outrage,” Oritz Mena said. “And Mexico City, which has a tradition of very progressive legislation, started to change its laws on abortion.”
Ángel Cabo, the Colombian Supreme Court justice, delivered a presentation about the evolution of abortion rights over the last 20 years in the country.
She discussed the Green Wave, a pro-abortion movement in Latin America and the pro-abortion organization “Causa Justa,” which she said helped shift public opinion in the country. Ángel Cabo said many Colombians came to view abortion as a public health issue, rather than a moral or religious one.
Similarly, Oritz Mena said the abortion debate in Mexico has shifted to center around women’s rights.
“The Supreme Court said two things,” he said. “First, women had a constitutional right to live without violence. The fact that the doctors had not performed the abortions was an act of violence. And secondly, the court asserted an affirmative duty by public hospitals to perform and give free access for abortion, safe and free access to abortion.”
During a Zoom presentation at the event, UC Davis Law School professor Mary R. Ziegler ’04 discussed the U.S. Supreme Court’s June ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson, which ended abortion protections.
“This story that both of these justices told you I think was a story about changes to democracy in Mexico and Colombia, and I think the same is true in the United States,” Ziegler said. “If you’re looking at how and why the United States is moving in another direction it, too, is a story about changes to American democracy.”

The regatta brings over 200,000 people to Boston and Cambridge each year. Thousands of spectators lined the banks of the Charles to watch the races this Saturday and Sunday.
The course takes boats by each of Harvard's river houses. Merchant tents set up on the banks of the river throughout the weekend.
Attendees bought lemonade, hot dogs, and fried dough at merchant stands along the Charles.
The Head of the Charles is the largest three-day Regatta in the world, featuring competitors of all age groups from around the globe.
Head of the Charles officials stationed themselves throughout the course. Above, they observe passing rowers from a boat in front of the John W. Weeks Memorial Bridge.
Crowds crammed onto the Anderson Memorial Bridge to watch boats from above, alongside the official group of Head of the Charles referees.
Rowers in a quad scull cut through the water on the last day of the competition, an overcast and rainy Sunday.
The course contains six bridges that rowers must navigate under. Here, an eight boat emerges from beneath the Weeks Bridge.
The race begins around the bend from the Western Avenue Bridge, pictured above, at the Boston University DeWolfe Boathouse. The course ends near Harvard athletic complex, just before Northeastern University's Henderson Boathouse.
Members of Extinction Rebellion, a global environmental movement, handed out flyers to attendees of the Regatta on Saturday.
Regatta attendees picnicked by the river on the picturesque Saturday afternoon, lingering even after the end of the races.
Students walking through Riverbend Park on Sunday afternoon took in the scene.
