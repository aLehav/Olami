After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EL PARQUE NACIONAL DE IGUAZU, Argentina—El Parque Nacional de Iguazú is nestled in the northeastern tip of Argentina, topping the arm that juts out into Brazil and Paraguay like a gaucho flexing his bicep. At the heart of the park’s 672 square kilometers of subtropical rainforest booms the magnificent Iguazú Falls, a trove of ear-pounding, breath-taking waterfalls crowned by shimmering rainbows and crystal mist. One of the seven new natural wonders of the world, Iguazú is almost too beautiful to believe—certainly too beautiful for words. Eleanor Roosevelt, visiting in 1944, could allegedly only manage two: “Poor Niagara!”
But travelers beware: Devils lurk in this paradise.
After a full morning of trekking around the falls, I was hungry. I strode out of a fast-food cabin alongside the Lower Circuit with a warm bag of empanadas. I was nearing a canopied picnic table when, like fuzzy raccoon-tailed, long-snouted demons summoned by the wafting smell of carne and bread, the two coatis attacked. Jumping up with their grubby claws, they ripped open the bag in my hands, scratched my arm, and probably would have eaten me along with the empanadas if I hadn’t run away screeching hysterically.
There’s nothing like being ambushed by hungry, deceptively cute-but-really-vicious, oversized squirrel-raccoon-anteater hybrids to make you rethink life a little bit.
My travel philosophy has always been to never take pictures. I traveled to Iguazú to Experience Iguazú with a capital E—not to see it through a tiny iPhone screen. While tourists were snapping selfies for the Instagram post, I liked to think I was actually Experiencing the falls—drawing novel, life-changing insights from the magnificent views, not merely scrapbooks snapshots of them. With this approach, I usually returned from trips with a vague sense of superiority over camera-clicking tourists—but few lasting memories.
Then I Experienced the coatis, and any pride I felt at being an intellectual traveler, not a clumsy tourist, was ripped away with that bag of empanadas. I had to squat down, like all the other camera-clickers, and take a picture of those cute furry devils (from a safe distance, of course). My friends wouldn’t believe my story otherwise.
Then I realized something. I wasn’t taking a photo; I was saving a story. I would relive and retell that coati ambush every time I saw that picture. I could Experience Iguazú all over again—with friends and family who weren’t there with me—through the very medium I feared would keep me from doing so.
The best stories, of course, come from Experience, not pictures. “I went to Iguazú and took this awesome selfie” makes a lousy tale, but “I went to Iguazú and took this photo to remember the time two over-sized squirrels stole my lunch”—now that’s a story, a traveler’s Experience with a tourist’s memory.
For future trips, I’ve resolved to take photos that save Experiences without replacing them. I’ve resolved to not take selfies but to take stories. Thus spoke the coatis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The night has cracked open and yolk is smeared across the sky as many young Lamonsters close their textbooks and feel for the braille on their foreheads, reminding them to get to class. Thursday has unfurled into Friday under the limelight of library desk lamps, yet again. These student know the drill by now: The walk of shame from the library to the classroom is easy, as though their soles have been trained to follow this path. They walk on eggshells as the day unfolds into the afternoon and the afternoon leaks into the night. Another weekend arrives like Atlas shrugging to lift the stress of the week before it. The two day vacation promises to be a reprieve from the craze that might be associated with the typical flotsam and jetsam of an academic week at Harvard.
However, a reprieve may come with a pen and a checklist. And if you’re name’s not on the list—well, you might not get the reprieve you were looking for—and that might not be a bad thing. But you’re still looking for this break, sans list. Remember Atlas shrugging? You are Atlas, and you want to shrug. Where do you go to shrug off the week?
Unfortunately, socialization at Harvard is at many times hindered by the presence of requirements and an exclusionary thinning-out process. Different groups have different ways to narrow their circles. For example, the Hasty Pudding Club has been known in the past to have odd challenges to complete in order to become members, including having to run “hastily” around the yard and perform other antics. Sororities and fraternities, another nexus of socialization on campus on the weekends, are saddled with a detailed rushing process and a notable price tag that reduces the number of participants.
Nevertheless, these methods of scaling a social ladder in order to participate in a social group pale in comparison to the hoops students catapult through in order to navigate the final clubs. The clubs take center place in, at least, students’ imagination of socialization on campus—an unarguable fact, especially given the yearlong discussions that rippled from the first proposal of sanctions.
I know it’s summertime and I’m a world away from Harvard Friday nights and the brick buildings lining Mt. Auburn Street, but somehow the conversation regarding social exclusivity and elitism still lingers. It still dominates a part of my life, as well as the lives of other Harvard students, with an odd sense of presence. And this presence, and the response to it, must be addressed.
The ways in which people believe the matter should be addressed, however, differ widely. A writer for the Huffington Post calls for student autonomy, vehemently arguing against the first round of sanctions. The National Review believes that the latest response from the committee infringes on students’ rights of free association. The Atlantic points its finger at the exclusivity and elitism involved in simply being admitted as the ultimate “source of all evil.” Students at the College have repeatedly written op-eds giving their perspective on the role of final clubs and exclusivity on campus. The response of the final clubs themselves? Possibly suing Harvard.
Yet, in spite of all these opinions, in spite of all those wrestling with the terms and conditions of the newest edition of the sanctions, the problem of exclusivity in Harvard’s social sphere on a Friday night will remain regardless of the presence of these organizations. This is not to say that nothing should be done to begin dismantling organizations that utilize discriminatory factors, often on socioeconomic lines, to promulgate class elitism and exclusivity.
On the contrary, the newest recommendations promise to address such concerns, although simultaneously glossing over the benefits that female social groups bring to their members. Students must be wary of accepting this one version of fighting exclusivity at the College panem et circenses. Other clandestine groups will inevitably form to fill the social void the final clubs will leave, and the same problem will continue to plague the institution.
So, now you’re a Harvard student post-new sanctions and it’s a Friday night. Outside the brick buildings that line Mt. Auburn St., you can almost hear the tense phone calls from final club board members to their attorneys, assessing the legal minefield that lies ahead. The pens and checklists are less noticeable, but the houses are still there, and people are still inside, the door still closed. But you keep walking by anyway, walking on those same eggshells, pretending you don’t hear the cracks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a decade in Harvard Square, the Japanese noodle restaurant Wagamama closed its doors at 57 JFK St. for good on Sunday, July 9.
The London-based restaurant chain shuttered its Harvard Square branch in advance of the upcoming expiration of its ten-year lease. When Wagamama opened in the Square in 2007, it was the restaurant’s second U.S location. The chain now has several Boston locations and one in New York City.
“Wagamama will close the store to focus efforts on their new location in Boston’s thriving Seaport neighborhood, coming this summer, as well as on the growth of its other Boston locations: Faneuil Hall and Prudential Center,” the company wrote in a statement.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that Wagamama was very popular when it first came to Harvard Square.
“When word got out that they were coming, we got calls for weeks and months,” Jillson said. “I think they’re a terrific company and they were so deserving of that sort of eagerness to see them in Harvard Square. But you know after a while, like everything else, trends change.”
“We were sad to see them go,” she added.
Wagamama was one of about 10 off-campus locations that accepted Crimson Cash. During the dining hall workers’ strike in October 2016, Wagamama reported a spike in Crimson Cash use and student business after HUDS added $75 to students’ Crimson Cash accounts.
The storefront will remain empty until a new business leases the property and is approved by the City of Cambridge.
“It’s my understanding that the property owner is going to be leasing it out to something fabulous,” Jillson said. “So we’re looking forward to that.”

There’s a familiar face in the latest Marvel action movie, “Spider-Man: Homecoming.”
It’s Harvard Business School’s dean of seven years: Nitin Nohria.
In the movie, Peter Parker (a.k.a. Spider-Man), played by Tom Holland, is getting ready for his homecoming dance. He watches an instructional video on how to tie a tie and—lo and behold—it is Nitin Nohria who teaches the superhero to tie a Windsor knot. Nohria’s official title in the movie is “Dean Crimson.”
“Spider-Man: Homecoming” has grossed $459 million worldwide since its release and made $117 million just on the opening weekend. Though the movie has received high praise from viewers—garnering a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes—critics have given it mixed reviews ranging from “captivating” to “disheartening”.
“Spider-Man: Homecoming” came out on July 7 and is still playing in theaters around the greater Boston area. Nohria’s cameo is towards the end, and while his appearance may be short, what’s a superhero if they can’t untie their Windsor knot dramatically?
