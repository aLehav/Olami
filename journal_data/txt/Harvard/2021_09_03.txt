After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Firstly, let me preface this by saying that I rarely eat fast food. I’d much rather enjoy one of my father’s home-cooked meals, perfectly baked or fried with generational recipes too sophisticated for my cooking skills.
But, honestly, I really wish there was a McDonald’s in Harvard Square.
I know, I know, before you crucify me — I’m being selfish. Harvard Square businesses are beloved essentials of campus life that have already suffered enough financial losses due to Covid-19. Introducing a multinational food chain like McDonald’s to the Square would siphon the patronage from surrounding small businesses until they wither away. I’m no economist, but I get it.
Listen: Like any Harvard student, I too tiptoe into the Square at late hours, gliding down Massachusetts Avenue and its intersecting roads to order from the restaurants that brighten our campus in the nighttime. However, in my short time here at Harvard, I’ve quickly learned that Harvard Square is not well suited for frequent, casual spending. At least, not for me.
I care about small businesses — I do. I don’t want to see them disappear. But let’s not pretend that the restaurants that adorn Harvard Square do not thrive off of Harvard’s tourism. As a world-class institution that has long cemented itself a household name, Harvard attracts everyone. And what attracts people attracts money. In normal times, over eight million tourists visit Harvard Square a year, making the area that spans only a quarter-mile the third most profitable retail market in the state of Massachusetts. Credit cards and dollar bills practically leap from wallets — and Harvard Square restaurants love this. They feed off of it.
But, the Square’s businesses don’t only thrive off passing tourists — they thrive off us, the students. They feast greedily into the stereotype of the “typical” affluent Harvard kid: the one with deep pockets and an insatiable stomach.
Although the Square and the University are legally separate, they are functionally one whole. Harvard Square would not exist without Harvard. So while the administration may advertise that 20 percent of undergraduate students pay nothing to attend the best university in the world, I know this to be untrue. Harvard is free for no one. Harvard’s exorbitant culture of dining at local restaurants multiple times a week — a day even — is an additional expense that taxes low-income students the hardest.
And, to an extent, Harvard recognizes this struggle. In 2016, Harvard expanded its financial aid program to provide freshmen with a $2,000 start-up grant to help pay for move-in expenses and jumpstart their college careers. But, after paying for transportation, textbooks, dorm supplies, and navigating a city where the cost of living is 73 percent higher than the national average, it dwindles.
So, if one can’t afford a $15 meal four times a week, what do you do? Decline the dinner invitations, say “I’m not hungry” or “I have to study tonight.” Splitting a $200 bill between five people in the evening means mentally balancing your checkbook the next morning in regret, and you can’t afford that. You save money, but miss out on everything else.
The shame that comes from spending money I don’t have, or eating in the dining hall alone at night, serves to remind me that just because we attend the same university, study the same subjects, and walk along the same roads, the Harvard poster child and I are not equal.
I would say this isn’t just about food — that the average price of a meal in the Square is a smaller inconvenience indicative of the larger pressures of being low-income at the most heavily-endowed university in the country. But, honestly, this is about food. Food is everything. Food is how Harvard students bond. Food is my best hope towards integrating a deeply stratified social sphere.
When I get too comfortable at Harvard, when I think that maybe I can blend in, the $11 organic kale salads snatch me back to reality. Warn me that Harvard is not my home.
Because Harvard Square is nothing like my neighborhood. There are no rival pressed juiceries and boba spots. There are no double-decker Starbucks, or places that sell frozen fruit smoothies in a bowl. Where I’m from, there are Polish sausage joints and gas stations that specialize in chips and Gatorade. Where I’m from, there are rival Burger Kings and White Castles. There are Taco Bells and Wendy’s, too, if you’re feeling fancy.
And there is McDonald’s, which is always busy, and always cheap.
So when I’m on campus, desperately running out of money, I yearn for my familiar fast-food restaurants. I yearn for reminders of home, reminders that yes, I do in fact belong here. Is that so wrong of me?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have a bright green turtleneck sweater that quickly becomes the focal point of my initial conversations with strangers. Once, at a party, a friend of a friend asked, “What’s the occasion? Why the green?”
The answer is that I like green a lot. And I am tired of wearing boring clothing.
Everything you wear, everything you put on your body: It all says something about you. Sometimes that’s explicit — if you’re wearing a Harvard sweater, you probably don’t go to Yale. Sometimes it’s more subtle. A pendant passed down through six generations of parents and children. Rainbow laces in support of the BGLTQ community. A ratty friendship bracelet from someone whose face is hazy in your mind by now that you can’t bear to take off.
Fashion is not insignificant or shallow or merely skin-deep. It is a method of self-expression. It shapes other people’s perceptions of you and your own self-perception. It becomes your second skin. Even if you think you don’t participate in the implicit language of style, you do. To quote Meryl Streep’s monologue from “The Devil Wears Prada” — and you know where I’m going with this ...
“You go to your closet and you select, oh I don’t know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance, because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don’t know is … that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and so it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry...”
Everything you wear is a statement piece because every piece makes a statement about you. Your clothes are always speaking.
As much as we claim to be above such superficiality, people will always be making snap judgments on each other based on appearances. Someone somewhere will always hate what you have on right now. If people everywhere are always judging your look in different directions, why do you care what they think? You can’t control how other people interpret your fits. You can only control how you feel in them.
Stop worrying about whether you blend in with what everyone else is wearing. Stop worrying about what’s “normal” or being over- or underdressed. Stop worrying about how other people perceive you.
Instead, wear things because they make your heart fizz with glee. Wear things that make you feel solidly good, not just okay. Wear yellow eyeshadow and dramatic stage makeup and blood-red lipstick because you like to mess around with the planes of your face. Wear Crocs and socks even though all your friends clown you for it because they’re comfy and you’re working on your divorced dad cosplay anyways. Wear a ball gown to the grocery store because you want to reenact a Jane Austen novel with the misters in the cabbage aisle. Wear things that are ridiculous and impractical but so, so loved by you.
There are infinite articles of clothing and accessories and infinite ways to arrange them on your body. Why would you choose the one way that makes you feel like a fly on the wall, detached from yourself, an imposter in your second skin?
There’s a dangerous idea that we should save the things that make us feel truly, really good for “special occasions.” The good china that stays in the cupboard dinner party after dinner party. The scented candle that we keep putting off burning for the end of a perfect day. The cute stickers that never get placed anywhere because then they can’t be placed somewhere else. There doesn’t need to be a special occasion to bust out the special stuff. Every moment you are alive is special and unique and will never happen again. Dress like it — it’s not a waste if it makes you happier.
So wear the comfort overalls with embroidered flowers on the pocket, the biggest dangly pair of hoops you have, the tux that makes you feel ready to take on the world. Who cares what anyone else thinks? I’ll be in my bright green turtleneck and traffic cone orange beanie, beat-up Converse and too much eyeliner, and we’ll be turning looks like no one’s ever seen before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past weeks, thousands of undergraduates descended upon an eagerly awaiting campus, toting masks and fragile optimism for the new term. Welcome tents and volunteers clad in bright red shirts brought the Yard back to life — for freshmen, at least. Sophomores and juniors — classes that, by and large, have still yet to experience a full year of in-person Harvard themselves — were left to figure out House life largely on their own.
In a normal, non-pandemic year, a flurry of Opening Days scheduling would have taken place by now: shows in auditoriums, public service days, House-organized events. The works. Juniors would have been moving into Houses they already knew well, with no need for extra support or guidance; sophomores would have already been warmly welcomed into their new residential communities housing day their freshman spring. For the latter, the loss of sorely needed programming was only worsened by the awareness that freshmen — newer freshmen, actual freshmen — were enjoying some semblance of the activity-packed move-in they never got.
So why weren't the Quad Lawn and the Yard serving as a revolving door of welcome back festivities throughout our extended move-in? Why didn't the University, which has so frequently suggested that outdoor socializing is pretty much fine, litter our grass with a thousand engaging activities for returning upperclassmen?
The easy answer is uncertainty — confusion about what is and isn't okay on our not-quite-post-Covid campus.
Students and administrators expected a waning pandemic to usher in our welcome this fall. So far, we’ve gotten anything but: Delta, a substantially more contagious variant of Covid-19, has been ravaging the U.S., hampering our return to normal before it even began. So even as we needed more welcome programming than ever, rapidly changing, contradictory, or unclear socializing protocols meant we weren’t even sure what that could look like. Students, eager to figure out what was considered safe, got no clear answer.
Our much-awaited double Convocation — where members of the band wore masks with holes cut out to play their instruments as hundreds of students sat, largely unmasked, only feet away — captured the spirit of our uneasy, puzzling return.
We are so grateful to our tutors, proctors, deans, and staff for trying their best to welcome us back to campus amid such confusing circumstances. But we need Harvard to provide us with more opportunities to get to know each other and the campus home we now inhabit. Upperclassmen — the juniors and seniors who became our institutional memory almost overnight — can’t bear that burden alone.
Harvard needs to support all classes as we make the transition back to campus. The dearth of reorienting welcome programming we’ve seen the first two weeks can’t cut it moving forward. Academic programming especially — concentration fairs, advising networks, department events — can’t fall through the cracks. Trust us, we need it.
We are not blind to the fact that the rapidly changing public health guidance makes orienting thousands of students to campus a challenge. But it’s clear that we — the administration and the students it serves — are all confused, and there’s no harm in either of us admitting it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 1,300 people signed a petition this week urging Harvard to preserve “shopping week,” the period at the start of the semester when students can browse classes before finalizing their schedules.
Classes for the fall semester began on Wednesday without a shopping week. For the third semester in a row, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences instead hosted a virtual course preview period.
“Wondering which of the 16 classes you’re interested in that you should take? Frantic about finalizing your entire course load just as you arrive on campus? Wouldn’t it have been great if you could have actually previewed each class and experienced it firsthand before deciding which courses to sign up for?” the petition reads. “That’s exactly how Shopping Week used to work in 2020.”
The group of students behind the petition — many of whom are members of the Undergraduate Council, which is currently out of session — allege that Harvard may be planning to permanently eliminate shopping week after temporarily replacing it throughout the pandemic.
Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, one of the petition's organizers, said he and the other leaders of the petition have been trying to educate students about the history and benefits of shopping week.
“Students here really love shopping week,” Harris said. “This course preview period that we’ve been doing the past three semesters is actually not shopping week.”
Shopping week has historically been a point of contention between students, who praise its flexibility, and faculty and administrators, who say it complicates scheduling, preparing, and hiring.
In 2018, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh suggested an early registration system, saying that administrators were “no longer certain that the benefits of the shopping period are worth the costs.” In 2019, faculty voted to preserve shopping week until 2022 and establish the Committee on Course Registration, tasked with brainstorming improvements to the current course registration process.
The committee is scheduled to issue its formal recommendation in the spring.
According to the petition, the course registration committee “has released proposals” to eliminate shopping week by next fall and replace it with an early course registration period, meaning undergraduates would register for courses as early as the end of the preceding semester.
Harvard representatives called the petition premature and urged students to await formal proposals from the committee.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane called the student petition "not accurate" in an email and wrote that the committee has yet to finalize its recommendations and is still exploring options.
“It is important to let the Committee do its work and not speculate on how and when that work will be done," Dane wrote. "Speculation and incorrect information leads to unnecessary student and community concern.”
Bernhard Nickel, the professor who chairs the committee, wrote in an email that the body “will communicate with students once the semester has gotten under way.”
LyLena D. Estabine ’24, who designed graphics for the petition, said she believes shopping week facilitates academic exploration and camaraderie.
“People tell stories about how ‘I had never heard of this before, but one of my friends asked me to go with them to this course for shopping,’ and it’s very much an organic, word-of-mouth process that has been stripped away because of course preview period,” she said.
Harris, the UC president, said that while many colleges use an early registration model, Harvard lacks the “advising structure" to do so successfully.
“We’re advocating for shopping week because we know that it is the quintessential tool for students to feel like Harvard is an academically inclusive place,” he said.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, another petition organizer, said he was dubious about the alternative solutions that the committee could create.
“I believe that they are trying to improve the course registration process — my problem is that they’re moving forward with a conclusion already in mind,” he said.

UPDATED: September 3, 2021 at 4:25 p.m.
WiFi outages plagued Harvard's campus throughout the first days of classes, causing “frustrating” network interruptions at the start of the school year.
Network interruptions began Tuesday, the day before classes commenced, and were ongoing as of Thursday evening, disrupting students as they tried to peruse syllabi and turn in their first assignments of the academic year.
Harvard University Information Technology first notified University affiliates of the network interruptions on Tuesday afternoon, and told affiliates that the issue had been resolved later that day.
On Wednesday, however, HUIT emailed students about another outage.
HUIT spokesperson Tim Bailey wrote in an emailed statement that ongoing WiFi problems are due to a “vendor software issue” and are not unique to Harvard’s campus.
“Several other higher education institutions are currently experiencing similar issues,” Bailey wrote.
Bailey wrote that HUIT is working “closely” with its vendor — Aruba Networks, a California-based wireless network company — toward a solution.
“HUIT staff have been working around the clock to resolve these issues, and we have implemented several changes to stabilize the system,” Bailey wrote. “Community members who need help connecting to the wired network can submit a ticket to the HUIT Service Desk or contact their School’s local IT support.”
The network problems are not related to cybersecurity, according to Bailey.
An Aruba Networks spokesperson wrote in a statement that it is aware of the issue and has been in contact with its wireless customers "detailing the mitigating steps to address the issue."
"As this is a high priority matter, our global engineering teams are actively working with impacted customers to provide the necessary support to resolve the issue as quickly as possible," the spokesperson said.
Amanda R. Stetz ’22 is enrolled in a class at the Graduate School of Design, which is conducting courses virtually for the first two weeks of September. Stetz described the WiFi outages as signficant and said she resorted to using a hotspot on her phone for more than an hour to attend class, "which was not the best," she said.
Samantha M. Woolf ’23, who also used a hotspot on her phone to gain network access, raised concerns that the internet issues may have a particularly disruptive effect on lower-income students.
“The disruption has been far from convenient,” Woolf said. “I can only imagine how difficult it's been for people who can't use hotspots. I've been able to sometimes use my phone as a hotspot, but for people who don't have unlimited data — that can get expensive pretty quickly.”
Jessica N. Dias-Jayasinghe ’22 said “more information" and "more transparency” from HUIT would be “helpful” for navigating future outages.
“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused during this busy time on campus,” Bailey wrote in his email.
Robert F. Greene ’24, who attended an online class from his phone on Thursday, said he will try to find a space in a computer lab or library with wired computers if outages persist.
“It’s really stretched out my day in a way that I don't like. It’s made it a lot harder to plan things, and plan out my time,” Greene said. “Fully interacting on such a small screen off of cellular data is a real pain in the butt. It was just not a good experience.”

Harvard Student Agencies is set to acquire Trademark Tours, the agency known for its flagship “Hahvahd” campus tour, according to a press release Wednesday.
The merger of the two companies is the culmination of a years-long partnership and is expected to bring 100 additional student jobs to Harvard Square, per the release.
“We would not be where we are today without our long-term partners at Harvard Student Agencies. I cannot think of a better long-term home for the company my team and I have built,” Trademark CEO Daniel A. Bodt ’07 said in the release. “We’re all very excited for this new era.”
HSA, which employs more than 600 undergraduates, has been in talks to acquire Trademark Tours since March.
“Trademark Tours is a natural fit for HSA’s mission of providing first-rate educational experiences and employment opportunities for Harvard undergraduates,” HSA President George C. Guarnieri ’22 said in the release.
“This acquisition is the single greatest opportunity we’ve had to expand HSA’s mission of providing high-quality student employment, as Trademark Tours will add more than 100 student jobs this coming year alone," he added.
The merger will not bring any leadership changes to either HSA or Trademark Tours. Bodt said he will officially work for the non-profit as chief of staff and work alongside students to improve the tours throughout Harvard Square.
“As far as leadership goes, we're really excited because we are bringing over the full-time staff members that were originally with the founder, and we're really excited about continuing to work with him,” Guarnieri said in an interview. “We're now gonna have student leadership involved as well, so we’ll have an HSA Managing Director helping work alongside Dan Bodt.”
“We’re not changing the tour structure, we’re not changing the tour guides, so a lot of things will be the same. But I think what we're excited about is all the new things we could potentially do once you have student input in the tour,” Guarnieri added.
Bodt started Trademark Tours in 2006 as a junior at Harvard. After graduation, Bodt continued to run and expand his company. As of 2021, his business has served nearly two million visitors and operated 75,000 tours, per its website.
The tour business continues to face challenges related to the pandemic, though, since the University’s campus remains closed to visitors until further notice.
With the Delta variant fueling a new surge in Covid-19 cases, Bodt said he believes a return to pre-pandemic tourism demand will be out of reach until early 2022.
Guarnieri and Bodt said they are optimistic about the future of their joint venture, citing prudent financial planning and their creative solutions to keep business flowing.
“We saw a great deal of tourism this summer,” Bodt said. “Even though the Yard is closed, there's so much of the campus that you can see from public streets. We managed to maintain our five-star rating on all of our online rating agencies, like TripAdvisor and Yelp.”
Both HSA and Trademark survived the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with low-interest federal loans to support their own payroll expenses and other financial obligations.
Trademark shut down its operations for nearly 18 months, while HSA had to discard its initial budget and financial projections for fiscal year 2020.
HSA and Trademark both received two rounds of federal loans, receiving a total of $295,000 and $355,000, respectively, according to ProPublica.
With students returning to Cambridge for the fall semester, Bodt said he is excited to see students again on campus.
“It was just so fun to see [students] lighting up and getting all excited about being back on campus and just really bringing some energy back to the Yard because it needs it,” he said.

After serving Thai food in Harvard Square for more than two decades, Spicies will shutter its doors in the coming weeks, making way for Boston Ramen Co. to occupy the Holyoke St. space.
Boston Ramen Co. will join Japanese ramen chains Menya Jiro, which opened in July, and Santouka in the Square.
Mario Srithipwong, a manager at Spicies for two years, confirmed Thursday that the restaurant would close soon. Srithipwong, who said he learned two weeks ago about the closing, said the restaurant was expensive to maintain, citing real estate and ingredient expenses.
Srithipwong also said Spicies was understaffed, a pervasive problem in the restaurant industry since the onset of the pandemic.
“We can’t find more staff to work in the restaurant, we can’t find more cooks, we can’t find more who can work [as] dishwashers,” he added. “We tried. We tried to find more staff.”
The imminent departure of Spicies will leave Nine Tastes as the sole source of Thai food in the Square.
Yasuhiro Sasago, principal owner of Boston Ramen Co., said the new business will be a “modern Japanese restaurant” that will offer ramen noodles alongside side dishes like sushi.
At a Cambridge License Commission meeting in August, Adam Barnosky, an attorney representing Boston Ramen Co., described the company’s plans for the new restaurant.
“The use and operation is very similar to the prior restaurant that was on site,” he said at the meeting. “It has similar hours, seating, and anticipated customer base. There will be some aesthetic changes to the restaurant, but no major construction.”
The License Commission unanimously approved the transfer of the restaurant’s beer and wine license to Boston Ramen Co. The state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission must confirm the transfer of the license before the new ramen store can open.
Students who frequented Spicies shared fond experiences they had at the restaurant.
Joshua Lui ’22 said he dined with a high school mentor at the restaurant.
“It wasn’t really premeditated or anything, but I saw one of my old high school mentors who ended up getting a job in Boston, so we ended up eating there one night,” he said.
Lui added that he looks forward to dining at the new ramen restaurant.
Griffin H. Wong ’24, a Crimson sports editor, described Spicies' closing as “unfortunate.”
“They were very kind to me after somebody took my order inadvertently, making me a new one and even letting me go back to the kitchen to watch, despite it being after hours,” he wrote.

Harvard increased the frequency of coronavirus testing for affiliates living in undergraduate housing Thursday, citing a surge of new cases less than two weeks since students returned to campus and on the third day of classes.
In the last week, Harvard University Health Services counted 94 positive cases, HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an email to affiliates late Thursday.
As a result, Harvard will require affiliates living in undergraduate housing to test three times a week — an increase from once a week.
“Many campuses across the nation are now facing high numbers of COVID-19 infections, so I am writing to encourage that we all act with increased caution in the days and weeks ahead,” Nguyen warned. “This pandemic is not over.”
The new cases bring the campus positivity rate to nearly 0.3 percent, according to the University’s COVID-19 dashboard. As of Thursday, there are more than 100 individuals in isolation and an additional 29 in quarantine.
In his email, Nguyen touted high vaccination rates across campus — 95 percent of employees and 93 percent of students are fully vaccinated — but noted that the spread of the Delta variant makes it vital to maintain “all of our safeguards.”
“If you need to interact with many people in a single day, keep your mask on, limit each interaction to under 15 minutes, and don’t stand closer than necessary,” Nguyen wrote, advising that students keep the number of people closer than 6 feet from them “as low as possible.”
Last Friday, Cambridge announced it would reinstate its indoor mask mandate, effective Friday. The same day, Boston began to require face coverings in all indoor public settings.
Citing both orders, Nguyen recommended affiliates follow Harvard’s indoor mask requirement “on and off campus.”
Harvard also extended its indoor mask mandate on Thursday to include all strength and conditioning facilities, according to a Wednesday email Harvard Athletics sent student-athletes.
“With positive cases steadily increasing since all students moved onto campus and the volume of student-athletes that will be training in contained spaces for strength and conditioning sessions, we made the decision to require masks to make the activity as safe as possible,” Athletics Director Erin McDermott wrote in an emailed statement.
The requirement is a reversal of a policy implemented last week that required vaccinated student athletes to test twice weekly, which McDermott said would allow them to safely train and compete maskless. Athletes living in undergraduate dorms will also increase testing to at least three times per week.
In a separate email with Nguyen on Thursday, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair called the rise in new infections “a turning point.”
“The Delta variant and our full-capacity residential campus has changed the landscape compared to early summer, and we need to respond as a community to the changing risk profile,” they wrote.
O’Dair and Nguyen added that the number of undergraduates in isolation housing — 63 as of Thursday — is only expected “to grow.”
“Let us be clear – this uptick is happening because this variant is highly transmissible, even within a vaccinated population. No one is to blame but the COVID virus itself, and it’s up to us to respond and protect each other,” O’Dair and Nguyen said.
Any undergraduates living off-campus are advised, but not required, to test three times a week, they said.
Ahead of the Labor Day long weekend, O’Dair and Nguyen asked students to modify any plans involving indoor activities and risky behaviors, such as partying or gathering with food and alcohol.
“Socializing with consistent and universal masking and minimizing the total number of close interactions you have in any 2-day window will make a big difference,” they wrote.

As students traversed Harvard's campus during the first week of in-person classes, some reported negative experiences on University shuttles, citing long wait times and crowded rides.
Run by Harvard Campus Services, shuttles criss-cross Harvard’s campus, connecting hundreds of students in the Quad and Mather to the main campus and transporting students to the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston.
The expansion of the shuttle system has rendered the service unreliable, students alleged.
Sílvia Casacuberta Puig ’23 said she felt “skeptical” about taking the shuttle from Harvard Yard to the SEC due to inconsistent wait times.
“You literally only get one chance to get the shuttle, and if you miss that one, the other shuttle is still at the SEC, so it would take at least 23 minutes if you didn’t catch the bus,” Casacuberta said.
Students living in the Quad also expressed concerns about the reliability of the shuttle going back to the Quad in the afternoon.
Pforzheimer House resident Chase R. Caserta ’24 said that while he wouldn’t call wait times a “huge issue,” he said he often has to walk back in the afternoon due to longer wait times.
“We wanted to come back on the shuttle, and we were at the Widener stop, but we waited like 10 minutes and then we had to go to the Lamont stop to catch another one,” he said.
Some students also flagged inaccuracies on the shuttle arrival times in Passio Go, the shuttle tracking app.
“One of my main issues has definitely been hoping to get on the shuttle, checking the app, seeing that no vehicles are available, and then seeing shuttles come by, and they were not reflected on the app,” said Kristina Pema ’24.
Campus Services spokesperson Michael D. Conner did not respond to specific criticisms about Passio Go, but he maintained that the “vast majority of shuttles did run on time.”
In addition to wait times, some students cited concerns about overcrowding on the shuttles.
On the first day of classes, Jaxson T. Hill ’23 said shuttles were packed to the brim, leaving some students susceptible to being turned away from crowded buses.
“It’s 100 percent going to be an issue,” Hill said. “The shuttle was so packed that the bus driver was legally not allowed to move forward.”
Casacuberta also raised concerns about shuttle congestion, describing her shuttle trip to the SEC as “very, very squished.”
“I heard several Covid concerns among the people around me, saying that it wasn’t very Covid- friendly,” she added. “That’s something that could be resolved if more shuttles were coming.”
In a Thursday Covid-19 guidance emailed to Harvard affiliates, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen advised for “reduced capacity to allow more distancing” on group transportation.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Conner wrote that the shuttle services were “closely following capacity guidelines from public health officials.”
Other students reported smooth shuttle experiences.
Michael C. Gul ’23 of Cabot House said he takes the shuttle at off-times — most often at 7:00 a.m. — and has not encountered any snags in his commute.
“When I have had or when I want to take the shuttle, I have not really had any problems,” Gul said.
Pema said she hopes the shuttle system will improve before winter in Massachusetts takes hold.
“Honestly, I’m just worried that when the weather gets worse — when it’s snowing or anything — it’s going to be the same waiting times,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2019, Harvard women’s rugby earned the program’s first-ever National Intercollegiate Rugby Association (NIRA) national championship, defeating the then-undefeated Army West Point squad in the final game of the year. After being a club team since 1982 and elevating to the varsity ranks in the 2013-14 season, the program reached its pinnacle in the 2019 season. Then, four months later, Harvard students were informed they must leave campus with no confirmed return date due to the outbreak of Covid-19.
A year and a half later, the Crimson is finally back and ready to further the program’s success. However, the team is making sure to approach this year’s campaign with a calculated mindset.
“Something we’ve actually been talking about is not thinking about it as defending a national title because so many of our team wasn’t there for the national title, but having the mindset that we’re going to go out and win it again,” co-captain Cassidy Bargell confirmed. “It’s not ours to lose, but it’s ours to get back.”
Bargell’s co-captain Erica Jarrell is on the same page.
“It’s so much easier to be an underdog than it is to live in the past and try to recreate something,” Jarrell said. “It’s always true, but especially this year we have a different team than the team that won that title.”
A big difference from this year’s group compared to that 2019 roster is that, compared to clubs at other colleges who competed last season, many of the Crimson players have not competed in collegiate action yet. Nonetheless, the group feels ready to tackle this new challenge.
“I think that our strength is also our challenge, and I also think that our team is up for that challenge and putting in a lot of extra work to try and fill that gap as much as possible,” head coach Mel Denham said.
Although they are yet to have collegiate rugby experience, the team’s underclassmen are ready for the job, and Jarrell has taken note.
“They [the new members of the team] are also all so driven,” Jarrell said. “They want to keep up, and not just to keep up. They already want to lead, which is really exciting.”
Both Jarrell and Bargell were elected captains during the pandemic, and the task of leading the team has not come without its challenges.
“I think it’s been really challenging because we don’t have any role models or anyone we’ve watched captain during a pandemic in person before, so we’ve had to learn a lot on the fly, but I also think that’s been fun because we’re facing new challenges,” Bargell said.
“It’s a lot of very intentional conversations about stuff we would normally never have to worry about,” Jarrell added. “From the night of [captain’s] elections, if not the next day, we’ve been having meetings about how to foster leadership and rebuild our team culture with an unprecedented number of people who have never seen our team before.”
However, despite all of the adversity that the team has faced amidst Covid-19, the leadership group has adapted and continued to build a winning culture.
“We learned pretty quickly that being in Zoom classes all day and then trying to get on team Zooms and actually trying to do official, formal stuff was not the most effective way for people to connect, so we really put that on our leadership group,” Denham said. “You can find engagement on Zoom that people want to do, but you’ve got to find the right way to do it.”
The team had weekly Zoom meetings, sometimes with the coaches present, but mostly as only team members discussing international matches being played, various strategies to implement, team workouts, and even building chemistry through team craft nights.
The Crimson has no shortage of strong opponents this season; however, Harvard faces most of them in the latter half of the schedule. The squad’s players and coaches are making sure to approach every game with a mindset that will give them the best chance of success.
The team has its first match this Friday, September 3, at 7 p.m. against Mount Saint Mary’s University. The Crimson last faced off against the Mountaineers in 2018 in a game in which Harvard handily defeated the Maryland school 39-0.
“This weekend our season opener is really going to be a tone-setter for going out there, and I honestly don’t know what Mount Saint Mary’s is going to bring,” Denham said. “They have some big, heavy, aggressive forwards and big, heavy runners, and we have to show up ready to go out there and be our best because, otherwise, I think that could very quickly spiral into something.”
As the Crimson continues to grow throughout the season, Harvard will face off against opponents that have dealt the team tough losses and close matchups in the past.
“I think that when we get to Brown, that’s going to be a big game for us too, so I think really the season opener is huge for us to really go out there and play at a level that we want to play at and not underestimate our opponent,” Denham said. “Quinnipiac will be big, and then Brown is going to be a really big one before we head into the Army and the Dartmouth games.”
This year, there will not be an Ivy League championship outside of the regular season records. Therefore, the Ivy League matches on the team’s schedule will be even more crucial than usual. The team with the best record in the Ivy League will be crowned Ivy league champion upon the end of the regular season.
“Playing Dartmouth and Brown are going to be more high stakes than usual because it’s half of our Ivy League championship, and also they have a pretty strong recruiting class,” Jarrell noted.
Finally having the chance to return to the field as a team for the first time in nearly two years, the Crimson is eager to begin the year this weekend and pursue another national championship.
“We have to go out there with an attacking mindset to go and get it [a national championship] again,” Denham said. “This is a new journey for us, and that journey is going to look different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It has been almost a year and a half since the pandemic stopped Ivy League competition, sent Harvard students home, and flipped the world upside down — but Harvard men’s water polo is finally back in the pool together and looking ahead to its first competition in 644 days.
“It was like Christmas morning … eight years old, you know,” said head coach Ted Minnis, reflecting on the team’s first full practice since its last competition. “It’s good to be back.”
Minnis, the reigning Northeast Water Polo Conference Coach of the Year, enters his 11th season as head coach, following an incredible 2019-2020 campaign that saw the team win an 8-7 thriller over rival Princeton for the NWPC Championship, Minnis’s 200th win with the program, and a berth in the NCAA Tournament in what was named The Crimson’s Game of the Year.
The Crimson opens its season this weekend with a four-game home slate at Blodgett Pool, with Mercyhurst University (10:15 a.m.) and Fordham University (3 p.m.) on Saturday, Sept. 4, and Wagner College (10:15 a.m.) and Austin College (12:45 p.m.) on Sunday, Sept. 5, as part of the Bruno Classic.
The team looks to follow up its previous undefeated regular season with a strong start, yet Minnis still stresses that Harvard has much to prove.
“We can’t worry about the past. We can’t compare ourselves to the past team,” Minnis said. “We have to be really focused on this moment and getting prepared for this weekend. I’m one that loves preparation.”
Preparation will be key for this weekend as Harvard faces off against four opponents it has not seen before. Fordham looks to be the biggest challenge, as the Rams come into the season at No. 20 on the Collegiate Water Polo Association’s Preseason National Top 20 Poll — nine spots behind Harvard at No. 11.
The weekend slate will be the first intercollegiate water polo competition for both first-years and sophomores, many of whom lost out on last season due to the pandemic. Minnis said the coaching staff talked in depth about having half a team that had never played together going into preseason.
Despite the Covid-induced challenges, Minnis finds a silver lining.
“I also think we can flip it and make the team more hungry because half the team hasn’t won a championship either...and the goal is to win a championship,” he said.
With the pandemic closing pools for an extended period of time, over the last 18 months, the focus for Crimson water polo had to shift, at least temporarily, to dryland workouts and staying fit outside of the pool.
“It’s been the longest break without water polo of my life,” junior goalie Noah Hodge said. “It was definitely weird, but it also gave me some perspective and kind of allowed me to recenter myself and realize how much I really do love playing the game.”
Throughout the hiatus in which the team could not play together, players used Zoom and phone calls to stay connected and present with one another.
Since half the team has yet to appear in a Harvard game, the Crimson will rely on the experience and leadership of older players. Hodge and junior attacker Alex Tsotadze will serve as the program’s 2021-2022 season captains.
Hodge is set to return after receiving the NWPC Tournament MVP award and an All-American honorable mention in the 2019-2020 campaign. Tsotadze finished third on the 2019-2020 team with 56 goals behind two former NWPC MVP of the Year winners — Charlie Owens ’19 and Austin Sechrest ’19.
“Alex has really worked hard on his game, both offensively and defensively. … I look for him to make big strides in all aspects of the pool,” Minnis remarked, also referencing senior utility player Jackson Enright, who is back for his senior season. “I think when you have a player of the caliber of Jackson on the team, I look for him to do big things.”
The Crimson return the other two of its top five goal scorers from the 2019-2020 team (behind Tsotadze) with sophomore Kaleb Archer (43 goals) and Enright (42 goals), while also bringing in plenty of younger talent, according to Hodge.
“A lot of guys [are] coming in with a lot of energy, a lot of passion for the game, a lot of knowledge about the game — and I'm sure as upperclassmen, we're able to learn a lot from them as well,” Hodge said.
Looking ahead to the start of the season, Hodge relayed his excitement and enthusiasm to be back, while also reinforcing the team’s mentality and preparation ahead of the fresh start against four teams it has never seen before.
“This goes back to just controlling what we can control. … We’re not going to be able to control what the other team is doing,” Hodge explained. “We’re really focused on our play style and getting all the young guys especially up to speed with our play system.”
Hungry to execute that play system, the Crimson will finally return to the pool this weekend, ending a pandemic-stricken 644 day hiatus.

Harvard’s first concert is less than 24 hours away, and CEB has really brought the ~magic~ with B.o.B this year! The Atlanta-raised rapper has had quite the life, signing on a major-label at only 17 years old and leaving a mark on all late 90’s/early 00’s babies with “Airplanes” and “Nothin’ On You.” Imposter syndrome looking at his CV? Not to worry - Flyby is here to help you get caught up!
Start a podcast
You’d be hard pressed to find someone at Harvard that hasn’t recorded a podcast following the creative finals season during our Zoom school year, so this might be the easiest one to cross off. Grab a friend, pick a topic, and start talking. Just some ideas to get you rolling, from Crimson Jam 2021’s very own headliner B.o.B: Flat Earth, egos, and cloning. The real struggle will be coming up with a better podcast name than The B.o.Bcast.
Get a noise complaint on your dorm/apartment
Fun fact: B.o.B was almost evicted when crafting his album because of noise complaints. He played the music too loud and the walls were too thin. Now, he was about to release what would be a chart-topping album so maybe there’s a little more clout involved, but after walking around the river last weekend, I wonder how many Harvard students could already cross this one off their list?
Join the Flat Earthers Facebook Group
B.o.B is willing to die on this hill. It’s the closing line on his Wikipedia page. It may be less of a highlight on his resume, but it still makes up a part of B.o.B’s larger-than-life personality. So for the B.o.B. aficionados and imitators among our readership, we’ll happily serve as your gateway to the Flat Earthers Society. Click here to find your new community! (Disclaimer: Flyby is not affiliated with the Flat Earthers Society<3)
Write a diss track
Celebrities, they’re just like us. After Neil De Grasse Tyson publicly @’d B.o.B’s Flat Earth theories, B.o.B came back as only every other celebrity must: he wrote a diss track. Flatline, a song we pray makes it to the Crimson Jam setlist, really settled the least scathing celebrity tea of the 2010s when it said, “Aye, Neil Tyson need to loosen up his vest.” B.o.B really did you all a service, setting the bar so low. We’ve seen harder digs on Harvard Confessions, so we have high expectations for you all. Pick your subject — perhaps the lines to Annenberg or your lecture’s overeager hand-raisers — and go off.
Launch a satellite into space
If it were May, we’d say catapulting anything beyond our orbit is far fetched and unattainable. But if Jeff and Elon can do it, what’s stopping Jefe’s-fueled Harvard students? After releasing Airplanes, B.o.B tried to raise $200,000 to send a spaceship into space to check if there were NASA employees guarding the edge of the world (are you catching the trend in his motivation?). While finances got in his way, lucky for you, you go to school at a small liberal arts college with a humble $41.9 billion endowment. Swing by the rocket club at the extracurricular fair, make a new bestie or two, snag some pieces of metal and fuel from the new SEAS building, and get crafting!
If you manage to check each of these off, like a true baddie, then you might as well be B.o.B. All you’re missing are a few Billboard 100 hits, but we can save that for your 30s bucket list. And if you need to brush up on your B.o.B raps, join the rest of Flyby’s team and listen to this playlist on repeat. We’ll see you at Crimson Jam tomorrow! It’s going to be So Good ;)

Crimson Jam has been postponed, and my current chances of seeing B.o.B. in Harvard Yard are dashed. And while that news is deeply upsetting, I’m a little more stressed about the whole idea that case counts might send us home again. In light of the new Covid-19 campus guidelines, I sure could use a guide on how to not fall into a nihilistic pit at the thought of yet another year of normal life wrested from my hands due to the pandemic. Usually I’d put a witty phrase here, but I’m not sure if I have the strength, so here we go:
1) Text someone you care about
I don’t know about you, but I’m a serial Shit,-I-read-this-text-and-forgot-to- reply-even-though-I-care-about-you type of person. Even if you have, like, functional communication skills, it’s still a good idea to connect to the people that make your life bright instead of staring at your dorm ceiling or doomscrolling.
2) Go outside and stare at the Charles
Disclaimer: This is more of a daytime suggestion. You should probably not wander the riverbank alone at night.
That said, there’s not a whole lot of ways to get out to nature and decompress within the Harvard Bubble. Luckily, we do have a decently cute lil river nearby. Maybe you can pretend you’re in a dramatic movie or something and look out over Weeks Bridge during the sunset? I don’t know.
3) Take a nap
I did, and it made me feel better.
4) Do your homework! Actually!
It’s now occurring to me that all of the above suggestions involve a fair bit of escapism. At the end of the day, grades and due dates still exist, so it’s probably not a horrible idea to stay on top of your readings and psets instead of spending all your time texting the besties / looking at water / sleeping. Maybe it’ll make you feel normal and distract you from the capacity limits of the Harvard Hotel. :-) hehe
5) Pretend that airplanes in the sky are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now.
Anyway, hope you’re all doing well. If someone actually knows how to cope with Potential Eviction 2: Electric Boogaloo, call me, beep me, you know how to reach me.
