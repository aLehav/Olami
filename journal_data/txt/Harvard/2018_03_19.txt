After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first few weeks of my high school government class, our teacher assigned the classic political compass quiz, consisting of two axes measuring economic and political ideologies. None of my classmates seemed surprised when my dot fell in the deep reaches of the bottom left square, situated somewhere between Bernie Sanders and the Green Party. Along with the few other liberals in my predominantly conservative school, an adversarial political culture forced me to routinely defend and sharpen my beliefs. But without many older liberals around, there was no model Democrat to imitate or prepackaged set of beliefs to take up. Unsurprisingly, my “dot” did not fall right on top of many mainstream politicians, leaving me in a place to agree with most of the Democratic platform while maintaining a critical edge.
As I entered Harvard, I recognized the advantages of my former atmosphere but hoped for a shift away from the close-minded mentality that accompanied it. Debate was entertained between students, but my beliefs were usually laughed off as impractical for straying from the mainstream. With imagination abounding, I entered my first few weeks in Cambridge ready to experience a new and vast array of ideologies. By the end of my first political conversation, however, I realized that I had entered a new echo chamber, this time slanted to the left. Here, too, beliefs outside the mainstream are generally laughed off, whether they be on the right or the non-Democratic left.
I did not expect or want to find the Kremlin on the Charles that so many at home warned me about. Rather, I was hoping for something simpler: more of the poking and prodding that sharpened my beliefs throughout high school. The predominant culture on campus instead serves as a roll call, demanding that students agree with certain benchmark issues to be considered enlightened, while asking no more. So long as students align with certain predetermined roles, either as mainstream Democrats or moderate Republicans, no one questions their beliefs.
In an institution filled with so many connections and so much ambition, an implicit assumption exists in the politically-minded portion of the student body: that we are preparing for careers in politics and that doing such requires conforming to existing party platforms. Unlike my high school, the model Democrat not only exists at Harvard, but it all too often defines how students shape their ideologies and future aspirations. While no one will be surprised that Harvard’s political culture is predominantly Democratic and left-leaning, we must reach our critiques further to demand more ideological diversity.
With so many former Harvard undergraduates holding seats in Congress—a body in dire need of ideological vitality—it is nontrivial to consider the school’s effect on national politics. When pundits try to understand the past decade of gridlock, followed by damaging election cycles for both major parties, the call is often made for greater compromise, which is inevitably and falsely linked to a need for centrism. Harvard and the country should instead focus on revamping the ideological foundations of both major parties, establishing a reservoir of ideas from which to draw new and innovative policies. But for this to happen, new leaders outside of the existing norms must exist, and this next generation of leaders must be willing to stand contrary to earlier party platforms and expectations.
In this light, our biology classes can perhaps shed greater light than anything offered by the Government Department: Without genetic diversity, a species that faces change is ultimately destined for extinction. Likewise, political parties that stifle ideological diversity cannot adapt to to the changing demands of an electorate. In the 2016 election, we saw the dawn of a new mass extinction, one that claimed the vitality of the Democrats and Republicans alike. With the exception of Bernie Sanders, who was not originally within the Democratic Party, neither mainstay of American politics possessed the diversity of candidates necessary to absorb the electorate’s new populist demands while sticking to level-headed politics. In fulfilling the biological metaphor, this evolutionary weakness permitted a political parasite to hijack the environment.
Ideological diversity does not appear out of thin air, but instead out of academia and the students it influences. At this crossroads, Harvard and its disproportionately influential alumni could offer a sliver of hope for American politics. For this to happen, however, our campus must welcome a broader range of political ideas than it currently does. Though critics of higher education often focus on its lack of conservative voices, the problem of narrow political beliefs plagues the left and right alike. The challenge is not so much a challenge of numerical representation as much as sheer ideological variation.
That Harvard offers a thrust into the political field should not come as a shock to anyone, but we must not let it determine our actions or our willingness to consider unique beliefs. If we only consider what will best land us that summer internship or that campaign fellowship, we threaten to uphold the stagnation of the current political landscape. After all, the ideas coming out of higher education should offer the diversity needed for adaptation. In other words, students are the only solution for tomorrow’s pressing needs and today’s suffocating gridlock.
For this to happen, however, Harvard and its culture has to acknowledge that liberals can disagree with Democrats, and conservatives can disagree with Republicans. Until then, we may succeed at producing alumni with impressive political positions, but we will not produce leaders with the courage and passion to effect true change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This piece began from a poem. Written in a crowded Peter Pan bus as I read Gloria Anzaldúa’s “Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World Women Writers.” She motivated me to not hold back on my writing. She pushed me to “write with [my] tongue of fire.” So that is what I am doing.
***
A boy once told me he wanted to hear more about this “triple minority thing” I have going on. For some reason, I guess he thought I’d be flattered by this statement. He wanted me to tell him more about what it meant to be undocumented, woman, and brown. We had just met and I was caught off guard. It wasn’t because he knew those things about me already. I’ve been open about my immigration status for years now, and my identity as a Latina is more visible. I was caught off guard because these seemed to be my defining characteristics. And I didn’t even know how to properly speak about any of them.
***
The world I’ve grown up in has demanded too much from me. At every turn, I am asked to share my experiences. I should be willing to take time out of my day to educate others on what it’s like to be me. I should be flattered that people want to hear from me. I am asked and expected to present my story in a clean and easily digestible form. I must cultivate my struggles to fit into small pills so that outsiders may get nutritional value and feel aware without having to understand the actual effects.
I am expected to mold my experiences into something that can easily fit into a newspaper article or 30-second elevator pitch. I’ve been conditioned to do so through my years of activism in the undocumented community, and it’s made me forget I have other identities that can be separated from my immigration status.
While there is no doubt that there is beauty in the community I’ve found through shared immigration statuses, barriers still exist when the woman and brown part of my identity is ignored. I was guilty of ignoring it myself. Being undocumented is a master status that has brought me unity with those who share it, but kept me at a distance from my Latina identity and caused me to neglect her. I have come to realize that she deserves so much more recognition.
***
It can be very easy to submerge yourself in this undocumented identity, especially when it is what is getting so much attention right now in the media. Being undocumented, I began to define myself by it. I found comfort in it. I’ve found this to be especially true for me as my life has come to revolve around all things immigration. It is what I live, and what I study here at Harvard. It is in my extracurriculars, as I am now one of the co-directors for Act on a Dream.
For a period of time, I was even able to find comfort in my undocumented counterpart, who is neither woman nor brown. I thought that’s all I needed. But when I lost the embrace of our common pain, I found strength again in women of color. My other identities were not fully formed before. The line was drawn at immigration status and no other pain was thought to exist.
***
This triple minority thing causes triple the pain, triple the discrimination, and triple the emotions bottling up inside me, seeking a way to escape. I found that escape through writing, both that of others and my own. I found enough strength through women of color like Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, Rupi Kaur, my friends, my sister, my mother, and more. While not all of these women shared my undocumented identity, I felt a closer bond with them through shared experiences I had never acknowledged before.
***
I am now trying to understand all my intersecting struggles. I am careful not to place all the blame for the difficulties I’ve faced in my life on my immigration status. It is from my difficulties that I draw strength. This status should not get all the credit, because each one of my identities has helped me learn how to fight. Each one has brought me strength learned from hardship. My women of color have helped me find the muse within myself. Through their writing, I am reminded that my writing is not meant to be for others. My experiences are not meant to be for others. They are meant to be for me.
I found that I was limiting myself by focusing solely on this one identity. It was getting overwhelming. While I found a lot of strength from my undocumented community, now I am finding even more in my community of women of color.
***
I rest my laptop on my suitcase as I wait for another Peter Pan bus. I am heading back to school from spring break, armed with the strength of my fellow women of color and my undocumented community. And if you ask me today to explain what it’s like to be a triple minority, I will have a new response.
I am not a triple minority. I am a triple threat.

“I don’t have an aesthetic, I’m a mess. Here’s my aesthetic, it’s called mess.”
Steve Almond, a Boston-based author and former Nieman writing instructor at Harvard, is a man of blatant honesty. He writes openly, borderline crassly, about his politics and opinions. He has publicly aired his thoughts on everything from being an over-obsessive music fan to his deep hatred of the soft rock sensation known as Toto’s “Africa.” Almond even claims to have engaged in a pseudo-sexual flirtation with Fox News host Sean Hannity.
Almond’s perhaps most honest moment came, however, in 2009, when he published an essay that dug deep into the psyche of men: “In Defense of Male Clutter.” For the enlightenment of non-males around the globe, the essay uncovered the secrets of male-centric, obsessive accumulation of junk, and why men just can’t throw shit out.
“I said male junk, but excuse the gender. Women, I think, have a tendency to accumulate less of this stuff, but they still have it—we all have it,” Almond says with a chuckle. Social commentary with a dash of humor is his trademark.
 
Though Almond says he thinks there is a universal desire to collect stuff, he believes his own relationship with material items is more extreme. Almond, for example, says he hears the voices of his clutter: “Are you ever going to pick me up again? Are you ever going to engage with me? Are you ever going to be a meaningful part of my life, or am I just a corpse you’ve been keeping around?”
This personification is something like a twisted sequel to “Sausage Party,” or an especially adult version of “Toy Story.” “You’re afraid to bury the body and move on,” he says.
But whenever he recalls a specific piece of useless crap, all the respect, emotion, and hope contained within that piece of junk come bubbling to the top, unable to do anything but spill over.
One of these specific pieces is—appropriately—an old soda can. “I found [the can] with Todd Miller in tenth grade in the bottom of this canyon. And it’s really this rare, beautiful artifact you can sell, you can make into artwork,” he says. “We were there, it was scary, and we overcame that fear. We dug deep. We were stinky and we thought we found a dead body, and what do you do with that? That’s a thing that happened that I can go back to, and I can’t go back to it if the object’s not there to call me back.”
Most people would call this story absurd. It’s an old soda can, for God's sake. It’s rusty, and, at this point, at least 30 years old. And the story itself is full of ambiguities. The point, however, lies not in the details but  in the sentiment.
“It’s all about your emotional lives. It just plays out through objects,” Almond says. He seems to always talk about his stuff with reverence, especially the things that others have made for him.
“I had an artistic friend of mine draw a doodle, and I look at it and it’s sort of like I can see the talents fester. I can see a shadow of that person’s soul,” he says, and it doesn’t feel like hyperbole. For some, memories might be divorced from their physical shells. But for Almond, the memory and the object are irrevocably intertwined.
This is why, whenever he tries to clean out his almost 5,000-strong collection of CDs, he gets pulled back into the past. To him, each CD is a miniature time machine.
The first time he attempted to downsize his collection, he paused to put on one of the disks. “I am brought back to Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1959—first year of grad school. Lonely as hell, horny as hell, self-destructive as hell. And here was the music I was listening to. Here were the people who were coming over for parties. Here was the woman I was in love with, here was the story I was working on,” Almond says. Just like that, he is transported.
He goes on to describe a seemingly innocuous grey T-shirt, an item he says holds twice as much meaning as any other in his collection. It represents both his fleeting years as a college soccer player and also the downfall of a relationship, ruined by the shirt itself.
“I just remember battling, not with my wife, but with an old girlfriend, over this shirt many times. And then one day, it was gone,” Almond says. There’s no resentment in his voice, only a plain statement of facts, the flatness that comes with the recollection of a past that might have gone in a different, better direction. He acknowledges that it seems silly to attach so much value to a shirt, but he shrugs it off because, in his own words, he’s a “dopey romantic.”
Almond’s daughter has developed a similar appreciation for stuff. According to him, she has a collection of 56 seashells from their trip to Florida lined up on her dresser. “And some part of that is just laziness, that she undoubtedly picked up from me,” Almond says, “but another part actually comes from kind of loving the world and being full of hope and possibility.”
“Nobody buys a shirt or picks up a seashell, or whatever it is, out of hopelessness,” Almond says. “They do it with the hope that it’s going to be important and meaningful. And it commemorates an experience. It’s a way to hold on to that experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Philadelphia over spring break to speak at Philadelphia High School for Girls, commonly known as Girls’ High, about the importance of higher education.
Faust, who stopped by Philadelphia to watch the men’s basketball team play in the Ivy League Tournament, urged students at Girls’ High to work towards a college education, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
“You have extraordinary gifts, and I encourage you to share those gifts by continuing your education—and building on them to reach out more broadly to wider worlds and new places, educating others as you educate yourselves and build your futures,” Faust told the students.
At the event, Faust also spoke about efforts to make higher education more accessible to a diverse set of students, noting Harvard’s push to admit students from “different kinds of economic and social backgrounds.”
She said, however, that there are still “opportunities that are less open to some people than to others” in higher education, even among universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.
“This is why America’s colleges and universities need you. We want your ambition; we want your talent; we want your ideas. We want your energy and your commitment,” Faust said. “And we need what only you can bring to our campuses: perspectives that will influence everyone around you, just as they will influence you.”
After the event, Faust told reporters she hoped the visit would encourage the students to “pursue their dreams.”
“It was also an effort to say I notice you, I notice you have talent and that you have possibility, and to reinforce in any way I could their commitment to their own talent and possibility,” she said.
Faust’s visit to Girls’ High marked the most recent stop on her speaking series at high schools across the country. In January, Faust surprised students at a Cincinnati public high school. She has also made the case for higher education in Dallas in 2014 and Miami in 2017.
In addition to visiting the high school and attending the Ivy League basketball tournament—where the Crimson fell to Penn and lost a slot in the NCAA Tournament—Faust also spoke at a reception for Philadelphia-based alumni.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pokéworks, a poke fast-food chain, opened its doors at 1440 Massachusetts Ave. for the first time last week on a stormy day when many stores closed in preparation for a nor’easter.
Poke, a raw fish salad native to Hawaiian cuisine, has in recent years spiked in popularity across the United States. As of 2018, multiple fast-casual restaurant chains specialize in the dish.
Originally a New-York based chain, Pokéworks now has 18 locations in the U.S. and one in Canada—as well as several new restaurants slated to open soon—according to its website. Pokéworks claims to be the largest and fastest-growing poke chain in North America.
The newest addition to Harvard Square offers up its namesake Hawaiian dish in a rice bowl, burrito, or salad with either chicken, tofu, or one of five types of seafood.
The Harvard Square Advisory Committee and Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals approved Pokéworks’s application for the space in July, and the company received its fast food permit on July 27, according to Cambridge Day.
At the time, Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she thought the restaurant’s bid was “really impressive” given the chain quickly attained necessary approvals.
The Mass. Ave space was formerly occupied by Liquiteria, a smoothie company based in New York, but has sat vacant since that store closed last fall.
Some students welcomed Pokéworks as a refreshing shift away from other, more conventional square eateries. Emily Chen ’19 said she liked the change from Liquiteria to Pokéworks because the chain offers food she can easily pick up when she in a rush.
“It’s slightly different from the other types of food offered in the Square in that it’s really casual, and really easy to grab, and also customizable,” Chen said.
Jonathan V. Garzon ’21, a Crimson business comper, said he agreed with Chen.
“I had only had poke once before, and I thought that it was pretty adequate,” Garzon said. “For a quick meal, and for a change from the usual Jefe’s and Felipe’s, it was a good way to go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most would struggle to describe the ending of the Ivy League season at the Palestra.
A good story might describe the 24 unanswered points from Penn between the first and second halves. A better one would throw in the 16 unanswered points from Harvard early on in the first frame and the 11 unanswered in a span of 1:44 to retake the lead late in the second. A great one might add the 19 first half points from senior guard Darnell Foreman and his buzzer-beating three from well beyond the arc to end the first half and give the Quakers a lead after going down by as many as 13 in the same frame.
Still, it would probably come short.
It would be missing the fact that Harvard’s late run and lead came after sophomore forward Seth Towns—fresh off Ivy League Player of the Year honors—went down with an injury. It would forget the two free throws and back-to-back threes from sophomore guard Caleb Wood that willed Penn to the late win. Absent would be the three from sophomore Christian Juzang just a minute after missing one badly to put the game within a possession with 47 seconds to go. It might leave out the fact that with five minutes to go and everything on the line, the Crimson’s lineup included two freshmen who hadn’t seen the floor extensively and a guard that was pushed into the starting lineup after sophomore guard Bryce Aiken—the previous season’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year—went down with a knee injury earlier in the season.
And that was just what happened on the court.
At some point the reader might be led to believe that there was no unimportant moment in the span of two hours at the Palestra. Perhaps they’d be right.
In the postgame press conference Penn coach Steve Donahue struggled to put words to it but settled on two—“Magical. Unexpected.”
And there could be more.
Some might call it an instant classic. Others might describe it as fit only for March. Some perhaps would say unfair and others would say it was a Sunday game at the Palestra at its finest. A good journalist would tell you the storylines abounded, and even the inattentive fan would find it hard to forget.
In a weekend when it would be difficult to steer clear of college basketball, the Ivy League conference championship was perhaps nothing more than a small rumbling in a building defined more by its past than anything. Even so, for those of us fortunate enough to spend the better part of four months watching from the sidelines, it was clear that this was another fitting episode in a building rightfully called the Cathedral of College Basketball.
Perhaps that would be the word—fitting.
The conference championship was many things and it wasn’t others. An objective onlooker might say the No. 2 seed in a conference tournament shouldn’t have home court advantage, but others—Harvard coach Tommy Amaker included—would tell you there’s no better venue in the nation.
“Is it somehow unfair a little bit in some ways to other teams in our league?” asked Amaker in the postgame press conference. “Maybe it is, but what an opportunity we have at that. To play in this conference tournament in the championship against a tremendous Penn team here at the Palestra. What an opportunity, what a win that could be.”
And that’s exactly what it was for both teams—an opportunity. It was a chance for Harvard and Penn to enshrine themselves in a building that has hosted more games, visiting teams, and NCAA tournaments than any other in the nation.
It would certainly be surprising to see the tournament continue on at the Palestra and as such it was a fitting end to the tournament’s two year stint there.
It was a season-long battle for a chance at the Big Dance between two teams that shared the regular season conference title and, in some ways, it was an abbreviated return to glory for both coaches—Donahue inherited a Penn squad that had underperformed for the better part of a decade after a tough stint at Boston College, while Amaker hadn’t seen a regular season conference title for two seasons after winning five in a row and making a statement wins at the NCAA tournament twice.
It was the dawn of a new era in the conference; after decades of the regular season conference champion earning the automatic bid, it was a fitting finish for two teams.
“This never happened,” Donahue said. “We won some league titles on the bus ride home—someone called us one the bus and told us we were league champions by the way.”
At the end of the day the truth of the matter is that the conference, much like the Palestra itself, is probably a bit past its glory days—a 16-seed for Penn in the tournament shows that more clearly than anything.
Sunday afternoon, though, with the sunshine coming down through the rafters, the two teams separated by a basket with seconds left on the clock, and the crowd on its feet, Harvard and Penn certainly made a bid for enshrinement in the Palestra’s past.
What a game.

At this year’s NCAA Championships, two members of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team brought their talents to the national stage. Sophomore Miki Dahlke and senior Jing Leung competed in the meet in Columbus, Ohio, which stretched for four days starting on March 14.
On day two of the championship meet, Dahlke raced in the preliminaries for the 100-yard fly and 200-yard freestyle. In the 100-yard fly, she finished in 21st with a time of 52.35, and in the 200-yard freestyle, she touched the wall in 1:48.00. In the 100-yard freestyle, Dahlke finished in 48.87.
This year’s performance marked Dahlke’s second trip to the NCAA Championships. She competed in the 50-yard, 100-yard, and 200-yard freestyle last year.
Dahlke’s championship run comes after impressive swims in the Ivy League Championships. The Mill Valley, Calif., native set records in the 100-yard freestyle, 200-yard freestyle, and 100-yard butterfly and was ultimately crowned the the Ivy League High Point Swimmer of the Meet and also received All-Ivy Fi
Leung competed in platform diving on Saturday. She accumulated 217.85 points in the preliminaries. The senior entered the championship meet after capturing first place at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships with a score of 514.85. This was her third appearance at the NCAA Championships. At the Ivy League Championships, she was also named the Ron Keenhold Career High Point Diver.

Harvard women’s tennis (7-8) did not really have much of a rest over spring break. The team was scheduled to play five games in eight days over break, but the contest against UC Santa Barbara was canceled due to rain. Ultimately, the Crimson won two matches at home and then traveled to California, where it split a pair of contests.
Harvard 4, California State Northridge 2
In the last match of the team’s visit to southern California, Harvard came up with a win against Cal State Northridge (2-6). The Crimson started the match on a positive note by sweeping doubles. Junior Erica Oosterhout and Natasha Gonzalez led the charge for Harvard by defeating freshman Alicia Dinkelmeyer and senior Mari Taslagyan. Captain Annika Ringblom and freshman Anna Li earned their 11th win as partners in a 6-3 decision in first doubles. Junior Isabel Jasper and sophomore Irene Lu won third doubles for the Crimson, 6-3.
In singles play, Oosterhout continued with her solid play and defeated Matador junior Skyla Alcon in two sets, 6-1, 6-0. Another player who stood out during this match was freshman Jenna Mostafa who beat junior Arpe Bagumyan, 6-0, in the third set of fifth singles.
Harvard, UC Santa Barbara (Cancelled)
On Friday March 16th, Harvard began playing UC Santa Barbara at their court in Goleta, California. The match was stopped twice because of rain before it was officially called.
For the time that the match was still being played, the Gauchos claimed the doubles point with wins in the second and third doubles. Before the singles competition was cancelled, sophomore Natasha Gonzalez was leading Lise Sentenac 3-2 in the second set after defeating her 6-3 in the first set. Oosterhout was also beating senior Palina Dubavets 3-1 in the second set before the rain got too strong.
“Rain delays are always tough. It’s hard to stay focused when you are constantly thinking about the weather and getting stopped,” Oosterhout said. “But I think everyone did a great job of dealing with that pressure. After our first delay everyone was ready to go and many of us were turning around our matches which is great to see.”
Gonzaga 4, Harvard 3
On Wednesday March 14, the Crimson played a close game against Gonzaga in a tournament hosted by California State University, Northridge. The Bulldogs took the lead early by winning the doubles point. The Bulldogs won the first and third doubles.
In singles play, Harvard put up a tough fight against Gonzaga. Sophomore Jenna Friedel picked up her tenth victory after dropping the first set, 0-6, to junior Graciela Rosas. Friedel responded by winning the next two sets, 7-6, 6-0 in second doubles. Ringblom picked up her 12th singles win with a two-set victory, 6-0, 6-2 in fourth singles. Also, sophomore Irene Lu won her singles match over junior Nevada Apollo in third singles. The win improved Lu’s singles record to 13-9.
“The first match against Gonzaga was our toughest,” Oosterhout said. “It was our first match outside and it is sometimes hard to adjust to the elements. It took us a little longer to get into a rhythm.”
Harvard 7, Providence 0
The women’s tennis team shut out Providence in the second game on Saturday March 10. The Crimson won the doubles point with a 6-0 doubles win from Oosterhout and Gonzalez. Oosterhout also won her singles match, 6-0, 6-3, over Risa Takenaka. Ringblom blanked Aiden Epstein 6-0, 6-0 in third singles. Friedel won her match 6-1, 6-2 in second singles.
Harvard 7, Marist 0
Harvard began its spring break on a very positive note, defeating the Red Foxes by a commanding margin. Harvard started off the game by winning the doubles point. The doubles teams of Ringblom and Li, Gonzalez and Moustafa, and Jasper and freshman Neha Gupta all won their matches to secure the point for the Crimson.
Harvard also dominated at the top of its singles lineup. Junior Erica Oosterhout improved her record to 13-2 by blanking Marist junior Chloe Lant 6-0, 6-0.
After a demanding week of play, the Crimson is set to host Quinnipiac on Sunday March 25 at the Murr Center Courts. This is Harvard’s last match before Ivy League play.
“As a team, we need to really focus in on what we struggled with individually this past week to contribute to the team as a whole in our match against Quinnipiac on Sunday,” Ringblom said. “I am positive that everyone on the team will be excited to get back onto the courts to work on our weaknesses before our ivy season on the horizon.”

While this weekend marked the official end of the wrestling season with the NCAA championships last weekend, it also marked the end of a distinguished career for one of Harvard’s very own. The Crimson’s lone competitor in the championships, senior captain Josef Johnson, capped off his wrestling career at Quicken Loans Arena after a fifth-place finish in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association Championships earned him a trip to the Cleveland, Ohio tournament to compete in the 174-pound class.
Johnson’s outstanding run came to an end in the consolation round of eight in the championships as he fell to senior David Kocer of South Dakota State. The loss came after a close matchup with the No. 14 ranked wrestler in the nation, Oklahoma senior Yoanse Mejias, in the round of 16. After Mejias tied in the third period, Johnson came back with the win in sudden victory to advance to the round of eight before falling by major decision in the subsequent round.
Johnson started the tournament with a tough matchup against the No. 4 ranked wrestler, junior Jordan Kutler of Lehigh. A close battle throughout the entire match ultimately resulted in a 2-0 decision in favor of Kutler with Johnson going scoreless in all three periods.
In Johnson’s first consolation round, the Piscataway, N.J., native took down sophomore Joseph Gunther of Iowa, resulting in a 3-1 decision in favor of Johnson. Gunther took the early lead with a quick escape to go up 1-0 before Johnson later tied heading into the third period. Johnson was dominant in the frame, registering a takedown and holding Gunther scoreless for the period.
In no way was Johnson new to success in the NCAA tournament. This year’s appearance marked his third in as many years. In his freshman season, he earned the Harvard wrestling team’s "Most Promising Freshman Award." In his sophomore campaign, he won a total of 17 matches and another team award, this time for most improved wrestler. His performances earned him NCAA qualifications for the first time as well.
Junior year showed even more improvement. Johnson posted a 30-13 record en route to another NCAA tournament appearance. He earned his captain title as well. Johnson’s senior year brought more of the same with a 29-13 record as well as two COOP student-athlete of the week honors.
Johnson finishes his career 92-56 record overall. Coach Jay Weiss praised Johnson for his contributions to the team throughout his four years.
"He's done everything the right way since he stepped on campus, and has made his mark on the program with leaderships, work ethic, and friendship," Weiss said. "I am extremely proud of everything he has done for the Harvard wrestling program."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A season removed from capturing the Ivy League North Division title, Harvard softball got off to a strong start in conference play against divisional opponent Yale in New Haven, Conn. The Crimson (9-9, 2-1 Ivy) took the best-of-three series with a doubleheader sweep on Saturday, outscoring the Bulldogs (3-14, 1-2) by eight runs in those games.
YALE 7, HARVARD 0
Yale redeemed itself in the series finale, giving Harvard its third shutout loss of the spring. Rookie pitcher Miranda Papes tossed all seven innings, striking out five and allowing just four baserunners.
The Bulldogs scored in each of the first five innings, keeping the pressure on the Crimson from the outset of the game. In the third inning, Yale loaded the bases with one out, but Harvard escaped the jam having allowed just one run.
Papes also helped her own cause hitting seventh in the lineup. The freshman pitcher racked up three singles and scored one of the Bulldogs’ seven runs.
Catcher Lindey Kneib was the lone Crimson hitter who had Papes’ number on Sunday. The sophomore collected two hits, including a double to center field in the second inning.
HARVARD 10, YALE 4
Harvard put on an offensive display in the back half of Saturday’s doubleheader. The visitors booted Yale starter Francesca Casalino from the game after 3.1 innings, having scored eight runs—one of which was unearned.
Co-captain Maddy Kaplan was the standout hitter amid a plethora of solid performers at the plate. The senior recorded hits in three of her four at-bats, scoring three runs and driving in four.
Kaplan kicked off the game on a strong note as the game’s second hitter. Junior shortstop Rhianna Rich drew a walk as the game’s leadoff hitter, and Kaplan immediately followed by launching a pitch over the right-field wall to give Harvard a 2-0 lead before the Bulldogs had recorded any outs.
Like Kaplan, Rich also scored three times. Junior third baseman Meagan Lantz and freshman right fielder Alyssa Saldana notched two hits apiece, with one of Lantz’s going for two bases.
Harvard starter Olivia Giaquinto also had a bumpy start, but Harvard’s bullpen curtailed Yale’s offensive efforts for the final five innings of the game. Junior Sarah Smith earned her first win of the season by pitching scoreless innings in the third, fourth, and fifth. Sophomore Alissa Hiener finished off the contest with two shutout frames.
HARVARD 5, YALE 3
Harvard kicked off Ancient Eight divisional play with a 5-3 defeat of Yale. All eight runs were scored in the first three innings of the game, with only five total hits coming in the remaining four innings.
Harvard’s offensive surge occurred in its second trip to the plate. Rich drove in pinch runner Isabelle Haugh with a single to right field, and Kaplan followed up with a gap double to plate senior Alexa Altchek and Rich.
Junior left-hander Katie Duncan occupied the circle all seven innings in the Ivy opener, allowing just one earned run and striking out three. A constant theme throughout Duncan’s starts this season has been stranding baserunners—despite a 1.51 WHIP, the junior has a 2.83 ERA, which is top-five in the conference.
Harvard’s infield turned two double plays in the contest to help clear the basepaths for Duncan. In the bottom of the fourth, the Bulldogs’ Allison Skinner sent a grounder to Lantz, who touched third and threw on to first baseman Olivia Giaquinto to end the inning. Two innings later, Papes grounded to Rich, who flipped to Haugh, who relayed to Giaquinto for the twin killing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 2-6 start to the season, the Harvard baseball team climbed briefly back to .500. Down in Clinton, S.C., a week and a half ago, the Crimson swept a four-game series at Presbyterian to run its record to 6-6 and drop the Blue Hose to 5-12.
The keys to the sweep? Confidence, a belief that they can win close games, and late-inning runs—a lot of them. In fact, Harvard’s ability to put on the backburners and generate scoring explosions late in games buoyed the team.
On Friday, the Crimson scored three in the eighth inning for some needed insurance runs in an 11-5 series-opening victory. Friday’s nightcap ended up being a quiet 2-1 victory, but Saturday’s opener saw Harvard run wild on the basepaths late as the team scored seven times in the ninth and tenth frames to take a 7-5 comeback win. The Crimson kept the foot on the gas in the series-closer, putting up five runs in the penultimate inning to cruise to a 10-5 victory.
“We have a newfound confidence that hasn’t really been there the past couple of years,” junior center fielder Ben Skinner said. “We expect to win. We expect to score runs late. We have a lot of fight this year...when the game’s on the line in the end, we’re expecting to get those big hits. We’ve been coming through in some clutch situations, which is a lot of fun for us.”
HARVARD 10, PRESBYTERIAN 5 (6 INNINGS)
Seven different Harvard players tallied RBIs, junior pitcher Kevin Stone went the distance on the mound, and the Crimson used a five-run fifth to run away with a 10-5 win in the series capper on Saturday afternoon.
“I think Presbyterian is a team that is equivalent, or, at the least, a good representation of what a pretty solid Ivy League baseball team would look like,” junior catcher Jake Allen said. “I think [the sweep] was a pretty big deal for our confidence and our overall outlook for the rest of the season.”
Allen went 2-for-4 at the plate, batted in two runners, and scored a run. The productive day at the leadoff spot capped off a 4-for-9 weekend for the Charlottesville, Va., native. Behind the plate, Allen also guided Stone, last year’s team wins pitching leader, to a win for a 2-1 record.
Harvard jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the top of the third, and even after the Blue Hose tied it up in the bottom half of the third, cracked the game open with seven straight runs for a 10-3 lead to pull away. Juniors Matt Rothenberg and John MacLean went yard back-to-back in the fourth inning to get it started.
HARVARD 7, PRESBYTERIAN 5 (10 INNINGS)
In the wildest game of the series, Harvard was shut out until the very last inning, but exploded for seven runs in the ninth and tenth to take the win.
With the team down 3-0 with two outs left to work with, sophomore Jake Suddleson got it started with a double. A batter later, the Presbyterian defense fell apart. Five Crimson runners reached base in a row with two outs in the inning, helped out by an error, and Harvard left the top of the ninth with a 4-3 lead.
“Our team, as a whole, showed a lot of fight,” said Skinner, who belted a two-RBI double to deal the most damage during the comeback. “We’re looking forward to Ivy League season, where we can use our experiences winning late in games now and hopefully keep that momentum going and be able to turn that into some wins in the Ivy League.”
Presbyterian tied it up at four in the bottom of the ninth, but the Crimson stuck with it, scoring three more in the top of the tenth for the decisive lead.
HARVARD 2, PRESBYTERIAN 1
A quiet 2-1 Harvard win in the Friday nightcap featured a costly error for the Blue Hose and a rookie starting on the mound for the Crimson.
Freshman righty Buddy Hayward, a two-way player out of Plantation, Fla., made his first career start for Harvard, pitching six innings of five-hit ball and giving up no earned runs. The rookie struck out six and walked just one in an impressive day of work.
Sophomore Hunter Bigge took over for the last inning, giving up just a walk and no hits to get the save.
On the offensive side, the Crimson benefited from an error leading to a run in the first inning, and tacked on another run on an Allen RBI single in the second to take a 2-0 lead after two frames. The early tallies held up, as the Blue Hose only crossed the plate once for an unearned run in the third.
HARVARD 11, PRESBYTERIAN 5
Spring Break got off to a good start for Harvard, as the Crimson broke through in the fifth and sixth innings to post two straight crooked numbers. The resultant 8-2 scoreline lead held up for an 11-5 rout.
Junior first baseman Patrick McColl had a career game at the plate, driving in five runs on a bases-clearing double in the fifth and a two-run double in the sixth. McColl’s impact on the team as a middle-of-the-order hitter can’t be underestimated, as he leads the team with 17 RBIs on the season.
Sophomore Chad Minato walked twice and scored three times, and Skinner also walked twice and score twice.
Harvard outhit Presbyterian 13 to 10 and was cleaner in the field, committing just one error to Presbyterian’s three.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2018 at 11:00 a.m.
NEW YORK — Two halves on Friday night epitomized the encouraging potential, all too frequently replaced by disappointment and frustration, that has typified the season for Harvard women’s basketball.
The Crimson (18-11, 10-4 Ivy) entered the evening hoping to extend its postseason, but left Rose Hill Gymnasium rueing what could have been, suffering a season-ending 65-47 loss to Fordham in a game that left head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith nothing short of perplexed.
“For whatever reason, even with defense as good as Fordham played, we’ve seen that before,” Delaney-Smith said. “I just had kids that normally don’t fall apart, fall apart, and I don’t know why.”
Despite Harvard carrying a 33-24 lead into halftime, the Rams (24-9, 12-4 Atlantic 10) utterly dominated the third and fourth quarters, outscoring the visitors by a 41-14 mark.
Fordham’s redshirt freshman guard Bre Cavanaugh took over the game after the intermission and finished the contest with 26 points, registering 19 second half points to outscore the entire Crimson team by five points.
Harvard’s defeat in New York was its second straight in an NIT game after dropping last year’s second round contest to St. John’s. Friday night’s game represented the Crimson’s sixth appearance in the past seven NITs, but despite the stage’s familiarity, prior experiences did nothing to quell Harvard’s inexplicable second-half meltdown.
Supporting Cavanaugh’s heroic 39-minute performance, the Rams clamped down on Harvard sophomore guard Katie Benzan, limiting her to just eight points, three of which came late in garbage time. Benzan was frustrated by the same face-guarding defense that Penn employed at the Ivy League tournament to neutralize the Wellesley, Mass., native for large chunks of the game.
The matchup was an opportunity to extend the season of seniors Taylor Rooks and Kirby Porter, who have both been key cogs for the team this season. While Porter served as a captain, Rooks battled injury after her transfer from Stanford, but has played a crucial role this season as the team’s second leading scorer.
“I just respect them so much as leaders, and the effort and the example that they have set for this team is unmatched,” said junior co-captain Madeline Raster of the graduating seniors. “We are really going to miss them next year.”
In her last time donning the Crimson colors, Rooks came out firing early Friday night, knocking down several jump shots from beyond the arc on her way to a 10-point quarter. The Warren, N.J., native’s efforts were needed to keep the visitors in the game, with Benzan drawing much of the Rams’ defensive attention while fellow frontcourt players’ Jeannie Boehm and Jadyn Bush struggled to score.
Even the typical boost that junior guard Sydney Skinner provided off the bench as a sixth man was noticeably absent on Friday night. Skinner was held to two-of-seven shooting, along with five turnovers in 30 minutes of action.
Despite the team’s scoring troubles, Harvard led by a 19-13 margin at the end of the first quarter due to Rooks’ efforts. Though the team pushing the lead to nine entering halftime, the Crimson appeared entirely unprepared for Fordham’s second half barrage. Fueled in part by a raucous crowd at Rose Hill, which loudly implored its team and the referees throughout the game, the squad out of Cambridge collapsed.
In many ways, Friday night’s loss represented the struggles that Harvard has become familiar with away from Lavietes Pavilion. Despite the contest being the Crimson’s first loss when leading at halftime, the 20 turnovers and the -11 rebound margin were all too recognizable signs of a road defeat.
The Rams excelled at home this season, cruising to a 14-3 mark before Friday, while Harvard had struggled mightily at 4-8 in road contests. In spite of the Crimson’s road struggles, the loss ultimately boiled down to shot making, as the visitors converted 58 percent of its shots entering halftime, and a whopping 72 percent of its three pointers. The second half told a completely different story, with Harvard scoring a mere seven points in each of the final two quarters and ending the game shooting just 35 percent from the field.
“I think we lost our confidence on defense, and a lot of the time our defense feeds our offense,” Raster said of the disparity. “We had some bad plays on defense and that led to some not-smart plays on offense.”
In addition to the offensive struggles, the stark disparity in free throws proved costly for the Crimson. Fordham was sent to the line 22 times, converting 20 free throws, while Harvard converted on two of a mere four free throws.
The officiating during Friday night’s game was a point of clear frustration for the visitors, with Boehm in particular visibly frustrated with traveling calls. The sophomore from Winnetka, Ill., struggled all evening, scoring just two points on one of five shooting and finishing the night with six turnovers. Boehm was severely hampered by forward G’Mrice Davis, who led the Rams in scoring this season while imposing a physical presence defensively in the paint.
Despite a disappointing end to the season, with the Crimson crashing out of the Ivy tournament and WNIT in two games that were well within reach, the team will hope to improve on the positive elements of the season.
“I think we’re continue to work hard, and try to just back to the [Ivy League] Tournament next year,” Raster said.
Although Harvard will graduate Rooks and Porter, much of the team’s core will remain intact next season.
With juniors Raster, Skinner, and role-player Nani Redford as rising seniors, in addition to an extra year of maturity for to-be juniors Benzan and Boehm, next season holds promise for the Crimson. To advance beyond this season’s results, Harvard will also need to lean on Bush and the other rising sophomores, to blend youth and veteran leadership to capture the tough wins.
Eventually, the long-term success of this Crimson team will rest on its ability to take care of the ball and play with the poise that it demonstrated at Lavietes Pavilion all season. Although Harvard was able to narrow the gap between Penn and Princeton and the rest of the league, beating both, becoming a fearsome road team will be the next item on coach Delaney Smith’s checklist.
“We had pockets of success, that we should feel good about. But we let a lot slip away, and there is still an overwhelming disappointment present,” said Delaney-Smith of her youthful team. “I would hope that we can learn from what we let slip away this season.”
Despite the bitter taste of Friday’s loss, coupled with a second straight early Ivy tournament exit, the future remains bright for the Crimson. A third-place conference finish, compiled with an astonishing undefeated, 12-win home campaign, demonstrate the potential for greatness for the future of Harvard women’s basketball.

CORRECTION: March 19, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Harvard lost in the opening round of last year's NIT. In fact, the Crimson won that game and subsequently lost in the second round.

Sections
Earlier today, Zack Cooper, Assistant Professor of Health Policy and of Economics at Yale, tweeted a screenshot of this email asking him to apply to speak at Harvard’s Commencement (in exchange for the miniscule, totally-not-a-scam request of his credit card information). In this revealing email, totally written by Drew Faust (long live the Kween), we see evidence of the best communication etiquette. Here’s what you need to know to impersonate Faust and pull off the most credible email heist of all time.
The Proper Greeting
In order to successfully impersonate Harvard’s 28th president, start your scam email off with the same greeting you give the section guy you hooked up with last night. “Hi” works, but other acceptable greetings include “Yikes,” “Don’t tell anyone about this or I swear to God,” and “*averts eyes and cries on the inside because you know he also lives in your House.*”
The Praise
“Harvard University is a big Fan of your work” is something we know we’ll never hear, but it’s the kind of compliment that would get us to do anything. Prime your target by buttering them up with this sweet sweet praise of “that thing [they] do” and prepare to make your proposal.
The Incentive
There are a lot of great offers in this email, which is what makes it so successful. Getting Drew to help you with a speech and having it on “the Harvard University YouTube channel”? Plus, “Grants,” of $3 million?! And all of that for two low payments of $1500. Sounds like a great deal to us.
The Extortion
Sending money to castaway Robinson Crusoe, who apparently lives in Missouri, totally checks out. Missouri is basically the same as an unknown island in the middle of the ocean—it’s only home to people who didn’t end up there on purpose, it’s probably a tax haven for economists named Larry, and we really have no clue where it is.
