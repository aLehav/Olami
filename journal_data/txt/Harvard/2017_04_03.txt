After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dirty Projectors’ self–titled new album begins with bells and ends with an organ. This wedding theme makes ironic sense for an album so single-mindedly focused on the end of a romantic and artistic relationship. “Dirty Projectors” is the first album released by the band since frontman David Longstreth and his longtime partner Amber Coffman broke up, and that loss makes itself felt on every song. In fact, one almost wishes the album explored other themes—by the end of the the nine-track LP, it seems that Longstreth has run out of new things to say about the experience.
At very few points is the album easy to listen to. Wildly syncopated beats, heavy autotune, and an eclectic mix of instruments and styles keep listeners on their toes.
“Dirty Projectors” opens with “Keep Your Name,” a subdued track that sets the tone for the rest of the album. Longstreth has called the opener “a divorce song,” and the lyrics certainly reflect that. “What I want from art is truth, what you want is fame,” he sings, and it is clear from the song that just as their partnership was both romantic and artistic, so is their breakup. Coffman wanted to move beyond Dirty Projectors onto bigger and better things, but Longstreth was happy staying where he was.
The rest of the songs on the album follow along in the same general vein. “Death Spiral” is a more typical breakup song, comparing Longstreth’s relationship to a plane going down. The beat is heavier and the vocals are harsher, but there is little that makes this song stand out. “Up in Hudson” is very simply the story of the whole partnership, from a meet cute in the Bowery Ballroom to its eventual end. It’s the longest song on an album full of long songs, and is marked by an interesting mix of hand drums and horns. “Work Together” feels like a darker companion to “Keep Your Name.” The lyrics are a bitter reflection on the artistic possibilities that would be open to Longstreth and Coffman if they were to get back together.
It’s not till track five, “Little Bubble,” however, that Longstreth lets go of the artistic aspects of his collaboration with Coffman, and goes completely romantic. The track is a standout—mostly acoustic, at times inflected with notes of soul, and by far the sweetest song on “Dirty Projectors.” The chorus is mostly Longstreth repeating the lines, “We had our own little bubble, for a while,” but he manages to communicate so much heartbreak through those few words.
Because “Little Bubble” is such a welcome break from the more jarring tracks that precede it, the next two tracks, “Winner Take Nothing” and “Ascent Through Clouds”—are an unwelcome return to form. The penultimate song, “Cool Your Heart,” is the closest the album gets to mainstream music, as Longstreth is joined on vocals by Dawn Richard.
Having spent his emotions, Longstreth is ready to let go on “I See You,” the final track. Underscored by organ music throughout, he comes to the realization that “the love that we made is the art.” The other ways in which he was viewing Coffman—primarily artistically—have fallen away, and she’s all that’s left.
All through “Dirty Projectors,” Longstreth wants to communicate the experience of his tragedy. However, at every turn, listeners are rebuffed by the dissonant sounds, unusual beats, and unnecessarily esoteric lyrics. Dirty Projectors seem to want their LP to be unconventional and often particularly specific to Longstreth, Coffman, and their once-shared aesthetic. However, their story and the lyrics that tell it are not powerful enough for the listener to truly care. Even those songs that are general enough for listeners to relate to the lyrics are musically so off-putting that it closes off real emotional experience. “Little Bubble” is the only major exception to this, and its success forces one to consider the unrealized promise of the album’s other tracks. “Dirty Projectors” is hard to connect with, but its greatest virtues are the moments when Longstreth gives up trying to be unconventional and simply sings what he feels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Harvard in 1995 looked a little different from Harvard today. Email had just became a consistently used medium of communication, cellphones barely existed, and college courses were different. But some things—traditions like Housing Day, for example—have not changed at all. In her second novel, “The Idiot,” Elif Batuman ‘99 explores freshman Selin Karadag’s experience during her first year at Harvard. The novel successfully offers a meaningful reflection on culture, love, and personality through humorous quips, character building, and chronological structure.
Batuman emphasizes people’s and objects’ places of origin to bring attention to the importance of culture to the main characters. Selin, the protagonist, is born and raised in New Jersey and is Turkish. Her best friend, Svetlana, is Serbian, and her love interest, Ivan, is Hungarian. Selin even pays attention to where mittens and shoes were manufactured when she goes shopping—Central America and Poland. Ivan too finds interest in foreign places: “[H]e just cared about countries. He thought they were meaningful concepts, and that it really mattered which one you were from and which ones you visited.” He focuses on the spread of culture he observes when he visits different countries. Later Selin notices this same phenomenon in the small village in Hungary where she teaches English: “Even the bullets here had nationalities. There were Czech, Finnish, Yugoslavian, and Chinese bullets.”
Furthermore, Batuman’s exploration of love adds a romantic aspect to the novel that will likely be familiar to many students entering college life. Selin’s own love story begins with a correspondence with Ivan through email. Later, they start to meet and spend time together in person. Then, Selin decides to teach English in small villages in Hungary to spend more time with Ivan in his country of birth, even though he has a girlfriend. Batuman effectively manages themes of unrequited and star-crossed love, sexual self-discovery, and friendship by connecting Selin’s struggle with concepts that anyone can relate to. Svetlana and Selin, for example, wonder about their own sexual inexperience: “Okay, my sexual experience might be limited to kissing my cousin’s boyfriend in the Belgrade zoo at age thirteen, whereas Sanja is having an affair with a thirty-five-year-old married newscaster. But even so, I think I have a deeper understanding of love than she does,” Svetlana muses.
Batuman also strengthens her novel by adding humor to Selin’s daily life and personality. Selin’s fears of trivial matters are explained with hilarious bluntness. Selin, with her self-deprecating attitude, makes funny comparisons between other people’s successes and her failures: “That was how Owen would end up with students who said ‘savor’, while I end up with students who said ‘papel iss blonk.’” Batuman successfully adds levity to the novel’s romantic undertones with a character who is not afraid to make fun of herself.
Selin, Svetlana, and Ivan all work towards discovering the motivations behind people’s actions by focusing on their relationships with each other. Svetlana sees similarities between the way she and Selin perceive the world around them which she attributes to their own closely resembling personal characteristics. “For a while now I’ve been conscious of a tension in my relationship with you.… It’s because we both make narratives about our own lives,” she says. Selin replies that she doesn’t think it has to do with their personalities, but rather their equivalent socio-economic backgrounds, exploring the different impacts of personality and background, the places you come from and the person you choose to be. Furthermore, Ivan struggles in his relationship with Selin because of their different characters: “This thing with talking, for example, is easier for me. I have a lot of sisters, I’m used to talking to them,” Ivan reveals to Selin, who spent most of her life as an only child. The self-consciousness in the novel adds to the self-discovery the characters experience, and Batuman’s focus on personality and the way the characters compare themselves to others provides substance by shedding light on human relationships.
The chronological structure offers order to counteract the disorder in the many themes, thoughts, and ideas that enter the storyline. The structure allows Batuman to magnificently create a profile of one person, Selin, as well as show the progression of all the other characters. The story starts off by setting the scene at Harvard, in 1995, then progresses to Selin’s move-in day, her first- and second- semester classes, and then her summer trip to Europe. The novel ends in Turkey, where she meets up with her mother. This timeline brings the story full circle as Selin goes back to the origins Batuman so emphasizes, and grounds the story in reality amidst the potentially chaotic elements the author includes.
This novel evokes the crazy excitement that Harvard is in the daily lives of students today, but it is also a time machine to the year 1995, when life as we know it was radically different. Batuman beautifully incorporates love, culture, and humor through her character’s personalities. With this book, Elif Batuman tells a story of a student’s life at Harvard that you don’t have to be a genius to enjoy—on the contrary, you can even be the idiot Selin often feels like.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Raise your hand if you have ever worn gym clothes all day.
I tried this once. I never made it to the gym that day, though the thought that I needed to nagged me until dinnertime. At 7 p.m., as I ate my salad in un-sweaty leggings, I felt like my day had yet to start. I hadn’t done the one activity I had gotten dressed to do.
Let’s try another one. Raise your hand if you sometimes wake up, brush your teeth, and then ask yourself, “Why change out of my pajamas if I’m not going outside?”
I’d like to answer that question with an unpopular opinion: It matters how you dress, even if no one is going to see you.
The last time I tried to be productive in pajamas, I wasted time on nonsense all morning, ate lunch, and then rewarded myself with a three-hour nap.
I think you’re catching on by now. I think it’s important to keep your gym clothes, work clothes, and pajamas separate. Not everyone feels the same, though. More often, I see college students wearing wrinkly, slept-in pajamas at three in the afternoon or sporting sweatpants to meet their professors. Someone told me recently that the last time he rode a plane, he saw another passenger wearing a onesie. It seems to me that we’re rejecting dress codes as if they were oppressive. But actually, they can be valuable.
I struggle to focus on what I’m doing when I’m not properly dressed, such as when I’m trying to write a paper, but my leggings won’t shut up: “You need to go to the gym in three hours,” they whisper on repeat. Furthermore, struggling to be present is a cultural problem that goes far beyond being underdressed, and we need to deal with it now in a different way than we used to.
A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to attend an intimate lecture with an award-winning author. Looking around the room, I saw many of the audience members dividing their attentions between the author and phones hidden in their laps. Few were listening, really listening, to the information being shared with them in real time.
I see people do this everywhere I go, especially if they are college-age or younger. I do it too. It’s hard to block out the endless string of stimuli spewing from my phone, to focus on the here-and-now. But when we’re too busy trying to see what is going on elsewhere, we can’t absorb what is happening right before our eyes.
This problem isn’t new, and it isn’t unique to America. In 1928, Russian artist Alexander Rodchenko worried, “We don’t see what we look at.” He proposed to solve this problem with a shift in photographic practice. Taking pictures of mundane objects from unusual perspectives, he thought, might capture their true essence and help viewers see the world when they look at it.
Unlike Rodchenko, who came up with new theory for the field of photography, I’ll make a much simpler suggestion for fashion—let’s revisit something we did in the recent past.
Let’s take advantage of the fact that certain types of clothing have different, generally accepted connotations. In almost every case, form was designed to fit function when the item was originally designed. There is a reason that suits are expected in environments like offices that expect productivity—lounging in fabric that wrinkles feels counterintuitive, and it’s almost impossible to doze off in a shirt and tie. The same goes for onesies and comfort.
Some designers are already capitalizing on fashion stereotypes to reimagine clothes with an artful creativity. The brand Vince makes sweatpants out of silk to turn a comfortable silhouette into something more formal. The tapered Adidas soccer pants and those tight-around-the-ankle joggers that seem to be part of every man’s wardrobe these days both create a similar effect—they’re comfortable, but they’re neat. In women’s fashion, pajamas seem to provide endless inspiration (see: the rise of the slip dress, the pajama suit, and the Gucci slipper).
The kernel of truth in Rodchenko’s words extends far beyond the field of visual art. It is possible to look without seeing, to hear without listening, or to exist without being present. To avoid simply going through the motions of life, we must decide to appreciate the things we’re viewing, hearing, or doing. We have to let them consume us, embrace us, clothe us.
Don’t get me wrong: I love coming up with creative ways to break fashion rules. The day I decided that sneakers were the new heels was the first day of the rest of my life. But even as I redefined the purpose of sneakers, I did it in moderation. I’ll wear sneaks with any fancy dress, but I differentiate my party kicks from the ratty ones I use to run around the Charles River.
Humans may always struggle to be truly present. But since Rodchenko’s day, enough has changed that we need to renew our approach to the problem. As more people become entrepreneurs, launching the next Google, Lyft, or Twitter while sitting in Tatte, the corporate offices that used to impose dress codes are losing power. In the face of this shift, we need to come up with a way of signaling to others and ourselves when we’re at work and when we’re getting ready for bed.
Maybe, this will simply mean that we design all of our “work clothes” to mimic the silk pajama shirts with lapels and buttons. If that’s the plan, I’ll lead the way. I must admit: I already own a shirt just like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a political and economic era where climate change denialism and deregulation are rampant, it is imperative that the University take a stronger position on the environment. This stance requires more than simply an acknowledgment of climate change to be true; it also necessitates tangible action. That action can only be shown through the unequivocal divestment of fossil fuels. It is, without question, hypocritical that the University continues to support climate change research and scholarship while continuing to hold even a small portion of its endowment in the fossil fuel industry. As the Trump administration continues unraveling climate regulations, Harvard must be forceful in showing support for issues that are crucial to the well-being of its students and the globe.
Research alone cannot solve the momentous environmental crisis the world faces. While research on climate change is vast, it is not exhaustive. And the continued monopolization of the energy industry by fossil fuel companies will not subside with research as long as institutions, like Harvard, continue funding a ‘more convenient’ source of energy. Divestment and climate change research are not mutually exclusive. Rather, the combined action will only pull the University’s usage of the endowment in line with the University’s espoused stance on climate change.
Divest’s demand for Harvard to pledge to not re-invest in coal is an important basic step in combatting climate change. This action is not difficult, as Harvard currently holds no investments in the coal industry: In the short term, it is a fundamental legal promise outlining Harvard’s commitment to financially disengage from the most dangerous fossil fuel, and a promise to continue fighting climate change on all fronts, not solely through research in the long run.
While our colleagues writing the majority view for the Editorial Board argue that other institutions’ previous symbolic gestures have failed to convince the public or policymakers of change, it is important to recognize that social movements and change do not occur overnight. The push for Harvard to make a statement on the moratorium on coal must not be devalued, as the symbolic acknowledgment of one’s participation is the fundamental first step in the finding solutions to a problem.
In a 2013 letter, Drew Faust deflected criticism of Harvard’s fossil fuel interests by claiming that divestment would amount to a politicization of the endowment. She continued, “the endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.” Despite Faust’s continued assertions of the contrary, the University is a political actor, and uses its funds for political means. If President Faust’s lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. are any indication, Harvard has always been a political entity.
Because President Trump has threatened to pull funding from institutions that do not align with the views of political authority in this nation, any action that the University takes is inherently political.
Divest Harvard’s request for the total divestment of “the direct holdings from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies” would not drastically change the political nature of the University or the way in which the University uses its funds. If one still believes that this action too greatly politicizes the endowment, ask oneself: What point in the degradation of our environment must we reach before we become full political actors against climate change?
Ultimately, choosing to divest is not a self-serving exercise. It is simply holding the University accountable to its values of truth and critical intellectual inquiry. Our dependence on oil does not preclude us from criticizing Harvard’s investment in fossil fuels. In fact, it requires us to question a global economic system that maintains the primacy of fossil fuels. The potential union between research and divestment places Harvard in a position to be on the right side of history—to fully commit to fighting climate change, rather than simply paying it lip service.
We are disappointed in the Editorial Board’s decision to support and promote the continuation of the discredited policy of inaction and self-rationalization in the face of crisis. By claiming that climate change is a critical moral issue, yet dismissing demands for divestment from the very industry that perpetuates it, both the Editorial Board and the administration have demonstrated incredible cognitive dissonance. We give unequivocal support to Divest Harvard’s demands that the University publicly commit to divesting from coal and other fossil fuels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Wednesday, in an echo of their week-long blockade of Massachusetts Hall in 2015, Divest Harvard prevented administrators from entering University Hall. They sought, in the words of one activist quoted in The Crimson, to “shut down business as usual.” In particular, they urged Harvard to announce a moratorium on investments in coal as well as to hold a University-wide meeting on divestment from fossil fuels in general. In contrast, the University has reiterated its long-standing view that divestment is both ineffective and politically dangerous.
We have long stressed that climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our generation. The science is clear, and there are many hard statistics that are equal parts drastic, unprecedented, and disconcerting: the global temperature has risen by 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, the sea level has risen by 3.3 millimeters per year on average over the past 100 years, and levels of carbon dioxide are at their highest point in the past 600,000 years.
In light of these sobering statistics, it is all too easy to construe Harvard’s current or prospective investments in fossil fuels as a form of derelict denialism or opportunistic economic myopia by one of the world’s foremost institutions of knowledge. But this debate between divestment activists and opponents is not one between those for and against climate science, nor between those for and against climate action, nor even between those for and against the urgency of present action. It is solely about whether divestment is a net positive strategy for reducing the risk of anthropogenic climate change.
We have expressed our criticism for the strategy of divestment many times in the past. Though the specific demands of Divest Harvard have changed, their underlying philosophy toward combating climate change has not. Simply put, it is the supply of and demand for fossil fuels that creates the market valuations of energy companies, not the reverse. Divestment has no ability to alter these basic economic realities.
Were Harvard to sell its minimal positions—at recent count, 0.2 percent of endowment holdings—in energy investments overnight, other investors would acquire these stakes, presumably understanding that the University’s decision was politically, not financially, motivated. In the unlikely event that Harvard’s sale were to temporarily depress the valuation of these companies, the amount of gasoline pumped, electricity used, and heating oil needed would still remain unchanged. So too would the amount of oil drilled, coal mined, and natural gas harvested. Harvard might be the poorer, but emissions would be the same.
Any case for divestment therefore operates purely on the symbolic level. Given that Divest Harvard’s most recent protest merely argued for the formalization of the coal investment moratorium Harvard has already instituted, they have conceded as much.
Proponents claim that a strong stance by a prominent institution such as Harvard, however negligible in pure economic terms, could serve as a catalyst for further action on climate. First, such claims overlook Stanford’s decision nearly three years ago to divest from coal positions. More broadly, it is quixotic to suggest that a relatively minor portfolio change by Harvard Management Company will convince the public and policymakers of the necessity of climate action. American presidents, foreign governments, celebrities, and nearly the entire scientific community have already emphasized the need for change. So too has Harvard’s already robust advocacy for climate solutions.
In more normal times, it might be tempting to see divestment, however ineffective on various levels, as a no-risk option. Suffice it to say that these are not normal times. As Harvard has long argued, using the endowment as a political tool is risky, and doubly so when President Donald Trump has floated proposals for taxing endowments. Such measures would be deeply harmful to the endowment’s ability to finance Harvard’s mission.
We have expressed our desire for Harvard to recommit itself, among other issues, to more generous union contracts, new social spaces, a bridge program for low-income students, expanded financial aid, increased faculty hiring, the establishment of new academic departments, and accelerated house renewal. None of these changes are possible without a robust endowment, especially in the context of a strained and overstretched Faculty of Arts and Sciences budget.
Indeed, absent strong investment returns, FAS administrators may be forced to cut research funding, much as they did during the financial crisis. These cuts may even impact Harvard’s climate research spending—amounting to tens of millions of dollars cumulatively—or resources like the Climate Change Solutions Fund, which recently provided a total of $1 million in funding to various projects seeking innovative solutions to climate change.
We sincerely hope that Divest Harvard is right that coal and other fossil fuel companies are on the wrong side of history. But President Faust and other University leaders are policymakers, educators, researchers, and administrators. We encourage them to continue to prioritize the practical value of Harvard’s work—including the real ability to conduct research to understand the challenge of carbon emissions and develop innovative energy solutions that reduce them—over the impulse to feel good about our high-minded moralism.
We should be united in working towards a carbon-free economy. For now, however, we hope Faust and others continue live in the world that is, not the one they may wish it to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a series of highly-publicized incidents last fall, Harvard Athletics has begun working with a team of consultants from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports to review the culture of the department’s 42 varsity programs.
NCAS is currently conducting a survey of student athletes, coaches, and staff about their experiences with Harvard Athletics and plans to host focus groups and individual interviews with department affiliates, according to emails from Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise and Athletics spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson.
Scalise announced the appointment of NCAS “to work on ensuring that our team cultures are aligned with our departmental values” in an email to student-athletes.
C. Keith Harrison, a business professor at University of Central Florida and former NCAA football player, is leading the survey review. Harrison’s research focuses on issues of gender and race diversity and inclusion in education, business, and sports. He has previously worked with professional football teams and other universities. Harrison declined to comment on his work at Harvard.
“Through this process, we will collaborate with and gain input from our student-athletes, coaches, and staff, as we seek to create the best possible environment in which to learn and compete,” Senior Associate Athletics Director Nathan Fry wrote of the review process in an emailed statement.
The department’s internal cultural assessment comes after a series of investigations into a number of Harvard teams in the fall. The Crimson reported in October that a member of Harvard’s 2012 men’s soccer team created and distributed a document that evaluated freshman recruits from the women’s team based on their perceived sexual appeal. On Nov. 4, Harvard cancelled the men’s soccer season after an Office of General Council investigation revealed that the practice had continued into the 2016 season.
The same month, The Crimson reported that the men’s cross country team had created yearly spreadsheets, some of which included “sexually explicit” comments, about members of the women’s team. After an OGC review into the team’s conduct, the Athletics Department placed the men’s cross country team on “athletic probation.” Following this decision, the Athletics Department announced that it would commission a professional review of the program’s culture.
The women’s cross country team has also been at the center of a series of investigations by faculty, Harvard’s Title IX Office, and Harvard’s human resources office after current and former athletes raised concerns about the team’s culture and the conduct of assistant coach Patrick Wales-Dinan.
NCAS’s survey, which closes Monday, was optional and anonymous. It asked participants about their demographic information and their membership in various student organizations, including final clubs. It also queried participants about team traditions and conflict resolution processes.
Other sections listed various ethnic, racial, gender, and sexuality identity categories and asked participants to rate how respectful and proactive in addressing discrimination their team, the department, and the College at large was towards these groups.
Further sections asked whether respondents had experienced personally or witnessed others experiencing “offensive, hostile, or intimidating conduct that has interfered with your ability to compete in your sport or learn in the classroom.” Subsequent questions prompted students to explain how, where, and from whom they experienced this behavior.
As the survey closes, department administrators have begun establishing and meeting with focus groups of student-athletes to further discuss Athletics culture and its impact among students at the College.

Fifty Muslim women leaders gathered at the Kennedy School Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to discuss Islamophobia and the role of Muslim women in society at the first-ever National Muslim Women’s Summit.
Co-sponsored by the Women’s Initiative for Self-Empowerment and the Kennedy School, the summit kick-started a fellowship program for the women, and delegates brainstormed ideas to implement and continue the event’s mission elsewhere. According to Rana Abdelhamid, a Kennedy School student who organized the event, the idea for a Muslim women’s summit came before President Donald Trump was elected, but following the election, the need for it increased.
Abdelhamid added that a main goal of the fellowship was to empower young Muslim women to be “agents of change” across the world and “create a more sustained network and sisterhood of Muslim women.”
Noor E. Sulaiman said she found the event empowering.
“I have been feeling very vulnerable lately as a Muslim woman and I wanted to get more tools to fight for people like me—to fight for Muslims, Arabs, and people of color in America today,” she said.
The summit offered workshops and speeches from activists geared toward building skills for successful activism, including workshops on fundraising and attracting an audience. Delegates brainstormed projects such as documenting the history of the hijab and the Muslim tradition of covering skin.
Speakers from across Harvard, including History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy '93 and Ignacio Ibarzabal, a Kennedy School teaching fellow, delivered presentations on creating effective narratives to gain attention and enact change.
Haifa F. Al Kaylani, a fellow at the Business School and the founder and chairman of the Arab Women’s International Forum, a nonprofit that looks to empower female-led Arab businesses, spoke at the event about how to build and gain support from an audience.
In her speech, Al Kaylani encouraged delegates not to “take no for an answer” and commended the conference for fostering an environment for Muslim women to connect with each other.
Bushra Hamid ’20, who also helped organize the event, explained that the summit’s organizers aimed to congregate a group of diverse women from around the world to collaborate on making change. Hamid said organizers intend to follow the fifty delegates’ progress throughout the next year.
“They already have so many inspiring ideas,” she said. “The next step is staying in touch with these women.”
Hamid also said she hopes to expand the summit outside of Harvard in the future.
“We want to take the summit to other cities, not just Boston. We saw how successful it was at Harvard University. It can be successful elsewhere,” she said. “For now, I want to stay involved and grow this summit and potentially partner up with other organizations who do these conferences.”
Abdelhamid, who is from Queens, N.Y., intends to bring the summit to her hometown over the summer.
“This is part of a longer term vision I have of what it means to empower the young Muslim woman,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student activists rallied in Harvard Yard and presented a letter to University President Drew G. Faust on Friday, calling on federal officials and Harvard administrators to commit to enforcing anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
Members of Our Harvard Can Do Better and the Law School’s Harassment Assault Law-Student Team organized the rally as part of a national day of action to defend Title IX, which prescribes how educational institutions respond to sexual assault complaints. Some activists fear that Trump administration may relax the enforcement of the law.
Students gathered in the snow and sleet Friday afternoon to march around the Yard, their mouths covered with red tape to communicate how students who suffer sexual assault have been silenced. They concluded the demonstration by delivering a letter to Faust’s office in Massachusetts Hall that outlines a set of “best practices” for Title IX enforcement.
The letter—which was organized by No Red Tape at Columbia University and signed by anti-sexual assault advocacy student groups and organizations across the country—addresses U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. It implores Sessions and DeVos to uphold Title IX and adhere to a set of “best practices” for sexual assault prevention and response.
“Because it is our collective responsibility to work toward creating communities that will support survivors of violence, we urge you to strongly enforce Title IX, the federal law that outlaws sex discrimination in education, during your time in office,” the letter reads.
DeVos’s narrow confirmation in the Senate as Secretary of Education stirred concerns among campus Title IX activists after she declined to commit to enforcing the law during a hearing.
Not only do the activists aim to put pressure on the federal officials with the letter, but Our Harvard Can Do Better member Jessica R. Fournier ’17 said that the activists aim to put pressure on universities to follow the law no matter what happens in Washington.
“The purpose of the letter is two-fold: it’s both survivor activist organizations talking to the federal government, but then also these are demands for our university as well,” Fournier said. “Whatever happens at the federal level, Harvard still has a responsibility to uphold Title IX and protect their students.”
Central administrators maintain that any changes DeVos makes to Title IX enforcement at the federal level will not alter the University’s efforts to prevent sexual assault or adjudicate complaints. After DeVos’s confirmation, acting Title IX Officer Bill D. McCants said in an interview he is “confident this will not mean a course change for Harvard at all.”
Harvard’s compliance with Title IX has come under repeated federal scrutiny. The federal government continues to investigate the College’s response to sexual assault, and a recent graduate is suing the University in federal court for allegedly mishandling her sexual assault complaint.
In addition to enforcement issues at the federal level, activists called on the University to adopt the “best practices” outlined in the letter. These include implementing mandatory annual trainings, providing academic and housing accommodations to students who have been sexually assaulted, and requiring cultural competency training for all staff members involved in handling Title IX complaints.
Some of Harvard’s schools have adopted several of these measures, such as annual trainings, but progress on sexual assault prevention efforts across the University remains uneven.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote that Harvard has taken several steps to address sexual assault, including disseminating brochures, creating web portals for training and resources, and a resource guide prepared by the Title IX Office.
“Over the past several years, Harvard has been at the forefront of efforts to more effectively prevent sexual assault and other forms of sexual harassment, and to respond when it does occur,” Jackson wrote.
But members of Our Harvard Can Do Better hope that the University will do more to address sexual assault on campus and serve as an example for other schools.
“There’s really no university in the nation that’s doing it right,” said Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better. “This is a moment for Harvard to do it right for protections on sexual violence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 students flocked to Boylston Hall for giveaways and sexual health-themed activities Friday evening as part of a kick-off event for Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
Dubbed the “Sexuality, Health, Intimacy, Partnership Party,” or SHIP Party, the event marked Response Peer Counseling’s first annual kick-off event for a month of anti-sexual assault programming. The group collaborated with other sexual health and peer counseling groups, which held smaller educational workshops at the party.
Activities included trivia on sexual health, workshops on gender and sexuality, giveaways, and a photo booth where attendees could take pictures and reflect on the different “-ships” they value in their lives.
Emily R. Zoffer ’17, a Response peer counselor, said organizers of the event “wanted to focus on the fact that it’s not just relationships, not just romantic relationships, any type of relationship counts and is valid and important.”
Representatives from the different co-sponsoring organizations said they found the kick-off an opportunity to spread awareness of Harvard’s sexual health resources.
“I think it’s a great way to reach out to the Harvard population," Emmalie A. Langan ’18, a Contact Peer Counseling member, said. "We are always interested in making sure especially first-years, but all the way up, know about the counseling resources as well as educational resources on campus.”
Lita D. Peña ’19, co-president of Sexual Health Education And Advocacy Throughout Harvard College, agreed.
“We all have the same goal in mind, which is to create a safer and healthier campus on Harvard, and one that promotes better sexual health and partnership and intimacy and sexuality. We’re very happy to be a part of it,” she said.
Andy J. Kim ‘18, who attended the event, said that he became more aware of the different sexual health and counseling resources on campus.
“I feel like these groups don’t have as much of a presence on campus as they should, and I feel like this event is definitely something that a lot of people have been talking about more,” Kim said.
Although this event was the first annual SHIP Party, organizers say it will not be the last. “It’s a tradition that will continue,” Zoffer said.
According to Peña, SHEATH will host “Sex Weekend” from April 7 to April 9 and will co-sponsor Harvard’s “Denim Day” on April 26, where participants around the country wear denim in order to show support for survivors of sexual assault.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard argued that President Donald Trump’s latest immigration order imperils its educational missions in an amicus briefing filed on Friday with 30 other colleges and universities supporting a nationwide injunction on the order.
A federal judge in Maryland issued the injunction March 16, reinforcing an earlier decision by a judge in Hawaii to prevent the order from taking effect. The Justice Department is now challenging that ruling in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.
In their brief, the universities argue that if the Trump administration prevails—meaning the travel ban gets reinstated—their institutions will become less diverse and lose international prominence.
“The Executive Order has serious and chilling implications for amici’s students, faculty, and scholars,” the brief reads. Other signatories include Brown University, Stanford University, and Yale University.
The the latest iteration of Trump’s efforts to restrict immigration from the Muslim majority countries, the executive order bars citizens of six predominantly Muslim countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—from obtaining new visas to enter the United States. This is the second time the courts have challenged Trump’s immigration efforts; a Seattle federal judge struck down the previous order, which included Iraq in the list and restricted travel for current visa holders as well.
Forty-five students and 63 scholars from the six listed countries attend or work at Harvard, and the University admitted 23 students from those countries for the fall of 2017, according to the brief.
“As the court considers the legal challenge to the executive order, we thought it important to have our voice heard about the significant impact the executive order has had – and will have – on colleges and universities,” Harvard General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano wrote in a statement.
Harvard challenged that first order in two amicus briefs, in addition to those filed by the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic at the Law School.
In Friday’s brief, the universities argue that the second order “risks the same damage” as the first, as it similarly hinders their abilities to bring international students and scholars to their campuses.
“The Executive Order at issue here, like its predecessor, threatens amici’s ability to continue to attract these individuals and thus to meet their goals of educating tomorrow’s leaders,” the order reads.
The brief follows a similar line of argument as those presented against the first ban, emphasizing the positive contributions international students and scholars make to their institutions and the United States more broadly.
“Even though the Executive Order is currently limited to six countries, American universities are already feeling its damaging effects,” the brief reads. “The Order threatens amici’s ability to attract the best students, faculty, staff, and scholars from around the world, and thus directly affects amici’s ability to pursue their missions.”
Beyond directly impacting the ability of students and scholars admitted to Harvard from the six listed countries, the order has created a “chilling” effect on the international populations at American universities more broadly, the brief argues.
In the brief, the universities argue that the order has created fear and uncertainty, causing international affiliates to be wary of traveling, admitted foreign students to choose to study elsewhere, and international faculty to boycott conferences in the United States. Participants are withdrawing from a conference hosted by the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, citing concerns about U.S. immigration policy.
Oral arguments in the appeals case will begin May 8 in Virginia.

Ruth L. Okediji, an intellectual property lawyer and professor, will join the Harvard Law School faculty as a tenured professor and co-director of the Berkman Klein Center in July, the Law School announced Friday.
Okediji, whose scholarship also focuses on global economic regulation, received both her Master of Laws and Doctorate of Juridical Science from the Law School and is currently a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. She also served as a visiting professor at the Law School during the 2015-2016 academic year.
“I did have a wonderful visit in the 2015-2016 year and of course Harvard is my alma mater,” Okediji said. “It’s always great to be home.”
Okediji said she will teach a contracts course for first-year Law School students and an intellectual property course. She said she is looking forward to working with students, both at the Law School and undergraduates, on integrating real work applications into her teaching.
“I think at no other time in our history has the rule of law been so relevant to countries around the world, and in my field, intellectual property, rules and the certainty and the reliability of rules affect almost all spheres of life,” Okediji said.
At the Berkman Klein Center, Okediji said she hopes to work on access to information and how Internet regulations impact people’s ways of life in developing countries, especially in Africa.
“I am hoping to be involved in promoting rules that greatly expand access to information in developing countries, particularly in countries where access to the internet has been threatened or has been underutilized,” Okediji said. “I’m very excited to be a part of that community and to explore how both the study of the Internet and proposals for its governance can influence in positive ways or, sometimes, can take us a step backward.”
Urs Gasser, the executive director of the Berkman Klein Center, wrote in an email that Okediji’s global expertise will benefit the center.
“Professor Okediji's thought-leadership in innovation policy, [intellectual property], and international law with a focus on the Global South will bolster our ongoing global research and network-building efforts,” Gasser wrote.

The Cambridge City Council will vote on a resolution Monday calling upon Congress to consider impeaching President Donald Trump, alleging that his business holdings violate the U.S. Constitution.
The proposed resolution calls upon the House Judiciary Committee to investigate whether or not sufficient grounds exist for Trump’s impeachment, arguing that the president’s involvement in the Trump Organization violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. It states that Trump’s business entanglements “undermine the integrity of the Presidency, corruptly advance the personal wealth of the President, and violate the public trust.”
 Passage of the resolution would make Cambridge one of a handful of cities nationwide, including Richmond, Va., and Berkeley, Calif., that is asking the federal government to look into impeaching Trump.
The resolution was cosponsored by Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Councillor Leland Cheung and Councillor Jan Devereux, and put together with the help of local activist group Cambridge Area Stronger Together.
Devereux said her reasons for supporting the resolution are straightforward.
“It’s a matter of safeguarding the Constitution,” she said. “[Trump] has not fully divested from his business operations. It’s really entirely unclear how these entanglements may be affecting his decision-making as president.”
The resolution’s argument is not new: In January, Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe joined a legal team suing Trump and arguing that Trump’s business interests violate the Emoluments Clause.
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said he also agreed with the resolution and supports calls for the Council to ask for impeachment.“Donald Trump has flown in the face of the Constitution,” Mazen said. “Betting odds recently had impeachment at, what, 56 percent,” he said, referring to odds made by British betting house Ladbrokes that have since been taken down.Mazen said that beyond Trump’s violation of the Emoluments Clause, he wants Trump’ to be impeached for his executive orders limiting travel and immigration from a number of majority-Muslim countries. He also said he believes an anti-Trump movement is happening on a national level, and that it could have an impact in future elections.
“There’s an enormous opportunity for the electorate to press their leaders.” he said. “I think a lot of organizers on the right are going to have to stake a claim of inclusion. We can move beyond polls to actually reach hearts and minds.”
Looking forward to the meeting, Devereux was enthusiastic about support for the resolution, both within in the City Council and beyond.
“I would be surprised if it didn’t pass unanimously,” she said. “Cambridge is a very progressive place and I think this is what the people of Cambridge want.”
The resolution will be heard Monday night at the weekly Council meeting in Cambridge City Hall at 5:30 p.m.

Several speakers, including mayor of Mexico City Miguel A. Mancera, addressed a packed crowd at the Graduate School of Design Friday night to discuss negative effects of urbanization and climate change on cities.
The bilingual talk, hosted by the Design School in Spanish and English, was part of a larger two-day event at the Design School on the unique challenges faced by cities in the 21st century. 
Mancera, who has served as Mexico City’s mayor since 2012, focused much of his keynote address on the importance of combating climate change for Mexico’s future.
“For the government of the city of Mexico, the theme of climatic change is a very serious point. It’s a theme that worries us. It compromises the city, the future of the city and our children,” Mancera said through a translator.
Mancera also made note of the numerous initiatives that Mexico City has undertaken to decrease its resource consumption, with an end goal of reducing its carbon footprint and contribution to global climate change.
Echoing Mancera’s remarks, Mohsen Mostafavi, Dean of the Design School, highlighted the linkages between urban growth and resource use.
“There is a dilemma, we urbanize, we improve things, we grow, but the very concept of growth itself produces the necessity for the utilization of more resources,” Mostafavi said. “And this is something, as designers, you have to deal with. You have to address this conundrum between the project of urbanization and the project of resource utilization.”
Diane E. Davis, a professor of urban design at the Design School, stressed the unique role that local governments play in addressing emerging urban development challenges. She said that local government leaders often fill the gaps left by national politicians who are ambivalent about climate change.
“The dilemma of national governments not always stepping up to the plate to solve urban problems and environmental problems means that other political leaders, acting at different sovereignty scales, must step into the breach, and this is where city mayors are becoming critically important,” Davis said.
While noting that Mexico City still has a long way to go to mitigate climate change, government professor Jorge I. Dominguez praised Mancera for his efforts to date.
“Mexico City is a gigantic city, and it is a city that has evolved over time with extraordinary challenges, challenges that are difficult for any mayor to address, and he has addressed them very effectively,” said Dominguez.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Future Harvard students may be required to take a new required category of course entitled “Thinking with Data” should the Faculty approve a motion that will be first discussed at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
“Thinking with Data” courses, according to a report from a subcommittee tasked with developing an outline of the requirement, could take several forms: they could be created from scratch or reshaped from existing introductory Statistics department classes. The courses would aim to teach students about how to acquire and analyze data.
While the report recommends that students take the course by the end of their sophomore year, completing the course by then would not be a requirement.
Unlike the foreign language requirement, students could not place out of the “Thinking with Data” course, although students who possess “prior experience” with data would have the option of taking an advanced course, instead of the more rudimentary courses.
The motion, presented by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, calls for the creation of a committee charged with implementing the proposed course requirement. The committee would begin meeting in the 2017-2018 school year.
Additionally, changes to FAS’s course schedule are up for a vote this Tuesday. If another proposal by Harris is passed, FAS will alter its course schedule with most classes lasting 75 minutes followed by 15 minutes of passing time, instead of the traditional “Harvard Time.” The proposal, created to accommodate longer passing times due to the future SEAS campus in Allston, would take effect in the fall of 2018.
Faculty members are also slated to dive back into debates on undergraduate social life at the meeting when they discuss Biology professor David Haig’s motion opposing Harvard’s policy penalizing members of single-gender social organization.
Last month, Haig submitted a motion to the Faculty moving that “this Faculty does not approve of Harvard College requiring a student to make an oath, pledge, or affirmation about whether the student belongs to a particular organization or category of organizations.”
Haig’s motion was in direct response to a report from a committee tasked with creating recommendations for the implementation of the policy, which states that, starting with the class of 2021, members of single-gender social organizations can not hold club leadership positions or athletic team captaincies or be recommended for certain post-graduate fellowships.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana accepted the recommendations last month, which included a provision that students sign a document affirming they do not belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization before applying for leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, or fellowships.
Discussion of Haig’s motion marks the latest in a series of debates among the Faculty on undergraduate social life. Last May, former Dean of the College Harry S. Lewis ’68 also introduced a motion opposing the sanctions, but withdrew it shortly after announcement that a faculty committee would be formed to re-evaluate the sanctions. Haig currently serves on that committee.
Last month, the Faculty Council, the highest elected body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, voted that this motion be referred to the Faculty committee. Their recommendation will be presented at Tuesday’s meeting, but the ultimate decision is up to the full Faculty.
Per Faculty meeting rules, the Faculty will discuss Haig’s and Harris’s motions, but not vote on them until a subsequent meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2017 at 3:58 p.m. 
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana fielded criticism and questions from students disappointed by his recent decision to reject a proposed summer program for low-income students at a tense Undergraduate Council meeting Sunday evening.
In a public 45-minute question-and-answer session, UC members asked Khurana why he dismissed the proposal and whether the College will establish a similar initiative in the future. Roughly 30 non-UC members and Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 attended the meeting, held in Harvard Hall, and some students grew visibly emotional during the questioning. Dingman also spoke and answered students’ questions.
The proposal—dubbed the First Year Institute—calls for a three-day freshman pre-orientation program to help low-income students adjust to Harvard. In lieu of this program, the College plans to create a new, part-time position in the Freshman Dean’s Office called the “First-Gen Low Income Student Advocate” who will specifically advise first generation and low-income students, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
At Sunday’s meeting, several UC members questioned whether this new adviser will be able to fully meet the needs of low-income and first generation students at the College. One in five Harvard undergraduates receives full financial aid, and roughly 15 percent of students are the first in their families to attend college.
“We have like 400 students in every class that identify as first-gen and the stopgap measure of providing one part-time counselor in one of our offices to reach out to all these students doesn’t seem like a requisite measure to be taking here,” Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said.
Kirkland House representative Laura S. Chang ‘17-'18 also spoke at the meeting, echoing Gonzalez’s concerns. She asked Khurana how he expected “one person in the Freshman Dean’s Office” to address all low-income students’ concerns.
“No one from my background ever came to a school like Harvard,” Chang said. “So my question is just, how can you expect us to be satisfied with the answer of having one part-time employee to serve all these different functions for us?”
In response, Khurana said he agreed students should not settle for the status quo.
“I don’t expect you to be satisfied, I’m not satisfied, we want to use this as an opportunity to learn,” Khurana said. “If this is inadequate, we will make sure that we are able to support students the way they need to be supported.”
Pressed to give a reason for rejecting the proposed summer program, Khurana said he believes it is important to focus on low-income students’ academic experiences at Harvard. He pointed to the “Emerging Scholars Program,” an initiative recently debuted by the Math Department that allows students from under-resourced high schools to stay on campus the summer between freshman and sophomore year to take additional math classes.
After listening to Khurana’s reasoning, Gonzalez asked whether the Dean was currently considering a longer opt-in academic program tailored to low-income students at Harvard. He also demanded to know why the College has not pursued such a program in the past.
“Give us reasons,” Gonzalez said.
Khurana replied that he believed Gonzalez’s questions merited “careful study” and added that the College is “continually open” to figuring out how to best serve its students. Disappointed with Khurana’s answer, Gonzalez followed up with one more query, overriding the objections of UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18.
“Would you give me a yes or no answer as to whether a large turnout academic program has been seriously considered by means of a committee or proposal in the past or is that something that is not yet being done?” Gonzalez asked.
Khurana declined to answer the question.
“So I’m not familiar enough with that specific type of program to give you an answer that I feel like it’s the right answer,” Khurana said. “I don’t feel like I have enough information to say that.”
Near the end of the question-and-answer session, Khurana reflected on the College’s progress addressing issues facing low-income students.
“I’m not satisfied with where we are, I think we have a lot of work to do, but I pledge to you this is a motivation for...me in this role,” Khurana said. “If I can do something worthwhile with my life, it will be to allow talented people to achieve their dreams and that’s what makes my life feel meaningful.”

Ezekiel P. Benshirim ’19, an Integrative Biology concentrator from Cabot House, was awarded the 119th Jacob Wendell Scholarship Prize Saturday evening at the Harvard Faculty Club.
Established in 1899, the Wendell Prize is awarded each year to “a Harvard College sophomore identified by the selection committee as the most promising and broad-ranging scholar in his or her class, without reference to financial need.”
In addition to $7,000 in prize money awarded at the reception, Wendell Prize winners can receive up to $7,000 for each of the two summers after sophomore and junior year, respectively, to work on summer projects approved by the Prize selection committee.
The guests at the reception comprised of representatives of the Wendell family, former Wendell Prize winners, administrators, and faculty members, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. Benshirim’s parents and siblings also attended the reception at the Faculty Club.
Benshirim plans to use the money from the award to conduct research on biomimetic micro-physiological systems, which are simulated human organs on a chip, at the Wyss Institute.
Outside of class, Benshirim plays viola in the Bach Society Orchestra and conducts research on fern sporangia with Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Noel M. Holbrook, who attended the reception.
Benshirim is also a modern and ballet dancer and is a member of the Harvard Ballet company. Connecticut College professor Heidi Henderson, Benshirim’s former modern dance teacher, attended the ceremony.
“She is a great person and a great dancer who showed me how to have unique and idiosyncratic ideas and be confident and graceful and polite about them,” Benshirim said of Henderson.
In September, roughly 200 sophomores were invited to submit applications to the Wendell Prize, which requires an essay and two letters of recommendation from Harvard professors.
After the initial application, eight students were selected to be interviewed in early February by the selection committee of seven faculty members chaired by English professor Philip J. Fisher. The morning after the interview Benshirim got the acceptance call and was astonished to win.
“It was a huge surprise and an incredible honor,” Benshirim said of his prize.
For his application, Benshirim submitted a comparative essay that was published by the Harvard Sustainability Office. The essay, titled “Daring to Care: Deep Ecology and Effective Popular Environmentalism,” focuses on how the differences between environmentalists Rachel L. Carson and James E. Lovelock parallel Arne Naess’s philosophy of deep ecology.

With a blizzard on the forecast for Saturday, the Harvard men’s tennis team’s Ivy opener against Dartmouth was rescheduled to Sunday afternoon. On Sunday, the team made the two-hour trek to Hanover, N.H., but the trip was worth it: with a 4-1 defeat of the Big Green, the Crimson extended its win-streak to four and entered Ivy competition on a strong note.
“I think the team did a great job today, high energy doubles and singles,” sophomore Andy Zhou said. “Everyone really stuck to and executed their game plans very well and that was absolutely critical to the win.”
Harvard (13-8, 1-0 Ivy) continued its dominance in doubles this weekend against Dartmouth (7-11, 0-1). Sophomore Chris Morrow and freshman Logan Weber made quick work of their opponents at third doubles clinching a 6-2 win.
The duo of co-captains Jean Thirouin and Sebastian Beltrame then took home a 6-4 win at second doubles, with Beltrame returning to the courts after a break due to an injury, and giving Harvard an early 1-0 edge.
“This was a really big win for us to get the Ivy season going,” Thirouin said.
The Big Green came back to win the first singles match and even the score as junior Grant Solomon fell to his opponent at fifth singles. Junior Kenny Tao and Morrow took the next two matches in straight sets at first and sixth singles, respectively, to put Harvard ahead 3-1.
Dartmouth proved tough competition. Thirouin and Zhou battled it out at second and fourth singles, respectively, both winning one set and giving up another.
“My match was a battle and probably would have lasted longer if they guys hadn’t clinched already,” Zhou said.
Yeung’s 6-3, 6-3 victory at third singles, however, decided the outcome of the match. With Dartmouth unable to recover from Harvard’s 4-1 lead, Zhou and Thirouin’s matches went unfinished and Harvard earned its first in-conference victory.
“This was a great start to the Ivies. Dartmouth is a very solid team this year and we had to bring our absolute best to close it out today,” Zhou said.
The Crimson’s win puts the all-time dual-match record against Dartmouth at 80-9. The recovery of multiple players from injuries, including Beltrame and Zhou, proved critical this weekend and will be important as the team continues on into Ivy play.
“I suffered a cartilage tear in my left wrist last summer that impeded me most of the fall, but the solution ended up being a brace,” Zhou said. “Now I just wear a brace on my hand when I play and it pretty much solves the whole thing.”
As it enters the rest of Ivy season, the team feels confident and looks forward to taking on the increased competition. With a three-game win-streak under its belt, the team will host Brown next weekend.
“We’re focused on taking it one match at a time and excited to see what we can do,” Thirouin said. “The team has been working towards reaching peak performance during this time of the season, and it’s definitely a confidence boost to have gotten off to a great start today.”

UPDATED: April 5, 2017 at 2:38pm
For the second straight weekend, members of the Harvard Track and Field team traveled down to Florida for an outdoor meet. This time, they left with a new record in the 100-meter dash, as sophomore Gabby Thomas clocked the fastest collegiate time at the meet.
The team split to three different places. While the majority took to Florida, several others traveled to New Haven and Stanford.
MARK YOUNG INVITATIONAL
The third meet of the weekend was exclusively for the field competitors. Taking to New Haven, Conn., for the Mark Young Invitational hosted by Yale, the two teams each racked up several top 10 finishes.
For the men, it was exclusively underclassmen that competed. In the throwing events, freshman Gunnar Allison represented the group in shot put, discus, and the hammer throw. The freshman took top ten finishes in the two former. In shot put, Allison claimed the 10th place position with his first throw, a 13.51-meter heave. It was his fifth throw in discus that would be his best, earning him the sixth place spot with a toss of 45.57 meters.
Competing also in the hammer throw was senior teammate Josh Whitener. For him, the first throw was his best, the hammer flying 50.43 meters and Whitener claiming the sixth place medal.
Freshmen led the team in the rest of the field events. In his outdoor debut, freshman Donagh Mahon claimed the bronze medal in high jump. It was his fourth of five that landed him the number three spot, clearing a height of 1.94 meters.
Competing in pole vault was freshman Ian West who took fifth place on his second attempt. West cleared 4.55 meters to earn his spot on the podium.
The women’s half of the meet was highlighted by junior Marlena Sabatino competing in pole vault. The veteran earned a second place finish with a 3.80-meter jump, getting close to her own school record, a record set at the very same campus last year. Sophomore Nicole Trenchard, also competed in pole vault claiming the fourth position with a 3.65 jump. Both efforts, Sabatino and Trenchard’s, land them among the top 10 finishes in the event in program history.
“It is inspiring to compete alongside so many high caliber athletes,” Trenchard said. “I can't imagine a time to be prouder to wear the Harvard H on our chests.”
Long jumper, junior Floriane Kameni, also got on the board leaping 5.33-meters. With the jump, Kameni placed fourth in as many tries.
STANFORD INVITATIONAL
In a long distance centered meet, four racers traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., to compete against several top Division I programs including Ole Miss, Washington, and Baylor.
Leading off for the group were two runners in the 1500-meter run. Junior Gabe Montague represented the men’s team and finished in eighth with a time of 3:56.36. On the women’s half of the event, freshman Brooke Starn took 11th.
In her debut outdoor race, freshman Judy Pendergast competed in the 5000-meter race. A qualifier to the NCAA National indoor Championships and the winner of the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in the event, Pendergast placed 16th at Stanford in 16:22.86 seconds.
Finishing up for the team was junior Elianna Shwayder who took 21st in the 10000-meter run.
FLORIDA RELAYS
Competing Friday and Saturday in Gainesville, Fla. were the majority of Crimson athletes this weekend. Among them was sophomore Gabby Thomas, a first-team indoor track All-American earlier this year. At the meet, she broke yet another the school record.
Racing in both the 200 and 100-meter dash, the sophomore broke the school record in the 100. With a sprint of 11.24 seconds, Thomas placed third overall in the event, but was the number one finisher among collegiate athletes. Finishing above her were representatives of Nike and Modern Sprints. In the 200-meter dash, Thomas finished in the gold medal position, crossing the finish line in just 22.60 seconds.
Also doing well for the women’s team was the 4x400-meter relay. Represented by freshman Zoe Hughes, Thomas, senior Jade Miller, and freshman Karina Joiner, the team finished in the fourth place position in the preliminary race, with a time of 3:39.35, another top-10 finish in program history. In the finals heat, the group improved to clock the fifth fastest time in school history, 3:37.73, and grab the third place medal.
Competing in the 100-meter hurdles were three representatives of the Harvard women’s team, all three clocked times in the top-10 program history. Leading for the group was Joiner who not only clocked a top program time, but her own personal best at 13.99 seconds to finish 44th. Following just behind her were teammates Hughes and Miller who finished in 48th and 52nd, respectively.
Miller also competed in the 400-meter hurdles. This time she took sixth and crossed the finish line in a clean 57.61 seconds.
For the guys, the standout among the runner was sophomore Myles Marshall. Running in the 800-meter run, Marshall clocked a 1:49.39 second time to earn himself a 17th place finish.
In the field, freshman Simi Fajemisin highlighted the women’s team. Competing in both the long jump and the triple jump, Fajemisin finished in fourth and sixth, respectively. In her triple jump attempt, the rookie leapt 12.78 meters, the third best jump in school history.
For the men, co-captain Julian Nunally led the group competing in both discus and shot put. In the latter, the senior claimed fourth place with his best throw of the year thus far, a 17.19-meter heave. In discus, his seventh place finishing, 53.64-meter throw was only three feet and 10 inches off of his personal record.
“Coach Saretsky has made it clear that if we focus on the process and training well, then the good marks and times will come,” Nunally said. “So that's the plan for all of us. Focus on the process and not the end goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A weekend removed from a dominant victory over Sacred Heart at home the Harvard men’s volleyball team (9-10, 6-4 EIVA) went down to West Virginia to take on the Charleston Golden Eagles (11-15, 0-12 EIVA). The Golden Eagles did not give the Crimson much of a challenge as they won only one of seven sets from the weekend’s contest. Ranked last in EIVA standings, Charleston showed flashes of life against Harvard, but would ultimately fall in both matches.
“We had to get two wins. It puts us in a really good position in the league right now, albeit we have some really tough matches in the next two weekends,” Coach Brian Blaise said. “We fought back in the hunt for the playoffs, so that’s really good. We were really good this weekend for six of seven sets.”
HARVARD 3, CHARLESTON 1
The Crimson, who earned a dominant win the night before, looked to earn a sweep against the Eagles to cap off the weekend. Charleston, however, kept the match interesting as it battled its way to a game victory and pushing the match to a fourth set.
Harvard dominant in the first two sets, winning 25-17 and 25-12, appeared to be on a way to a perfect 6-0 sweep on the weekend. However, a major momentum swing by Charleston in the third set caught Harvard on its heels. Charleston would end the third game with 9 kills and a hitting percentage of  .333,  while the Crimson committed eight errors and had a hitting percentage of -.182 percent.
“They turned it loose at the service line, and started hitting those serves hard. We just got back on our heels and collapsed from there,” Blaise said. “There was a complete momentum shift, they started playing looser and we started playing tighter. They’ve played good enough teams that when they start getting hot they can make it hard for you.”
The Golden Eagles would win the lopsided set by a score of 25-11.
The third set scare proved to have no effect on the resilient Crimson as it would rebound in the fourth set. Lead by co-captain Casey White and freshman Erik Johnsson, earning 13 and 11 kills, respectively, Harvard closed out the match with a decisive fourth set victory.
The lively play by freshman Matthew Ctvrtlik and Johnsson has invigorated the mature squad, however, the steady heads of White and junior Marko Kostich, makes sure to minimize rookie mistakes.
“We start a lot of freshman, so there’s a tendency to be a bit erratic. I pride myself on being steady both in my play and in my emotions on the court,” White said. “I think it helps the [underclassmen] see that everything is ok when things aren’t going our way.”
Kostich, who leads the team with 364 assists, would serve up 27 in Saturday afternoon’s contest.
HARVARD 3, CHARLESTON 0
After a major victory over Sacred Heart the Crimson looked to keep their momentum and earn another conference victory on the road. An aggressive offensive performance resulted in a quick three set victory for Harvard, winning the sets by scores of 25-20, 25-21, and 25-16.
White lead the team with 11 kills, while Ctvrtlik would lead the team with 19 assists.
“We’re pretty determined to make a playoff run here. I think we’re not afraid to battle; we want to compete,” Blaise said. “We’re starting to do some good things, things we’ve been working on, things we hadn’t done earlier. We’ll see these next two weekends, they’re really important and will tell us a lot.”
After the weekend’s matches Harvard is now tied for second in the conference. It will look to continue its success next weekend as it returns home to take on Saint Francis, also tied for second, and the nationally ranked Penn State Nittany Lions.
“We have two pretty big matches next weekend. We always look forward to Penn State, but with so much parity in the league this year I feel that it’s important to view every match in itself,” White said. “We have to come prepared everyday, and just know that we’re in for a bar fight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In each of its last two matchups, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team has had to contend with a late push from its opponent.
Earlier this week, Stanford mounted a successful comeback attempt at the end of its game against the Crimson, scoring with less than two seconds remaining to eke out a win.
On Sunday, Harvard faced a similar push in its contest against Dartmouth (5-4, 0-3 Ivy League), as the Big Green scored four unanswered goals in the final five minutes of play.
However, Dartmouth’s late efforts would not be enough to overcome a dominating offensive performance from the Crimson. In the end, Harvard (6-4, 3-0 Ivy) came away with the win in Hanover, N.H., beating out the Big Green, 17-12 to remain undefeated in the Ancient Eight.
“It felt good to get another Ivy League win under our belt and see people step up all over the field,” tri-captain midfielder Megan Hennessey said. “It was a full team effort.”
Three Harvard players recorded hat tricks en route to the victory. Senior attacker Marisa Romeo recorded a game-high five scores and two assists. Sunday’s matchup marked the eighth time this season that the senior has netted three or more goals.
Hennessey and tri-captain attacker Maeve McMahon also chipped in hat tricks.
Despite the Crimson’s strong attacking play, the team had something of a late scare, as the Big Green went on an 8-3 run in the final 15 minutes of the contest.
Dartmouth freshman midfielder Katie Bourque kicked off the Big Green streak, picking up a team-high fourth finish of the day with 11:51 left in the game.
Romeo responded three minutes later with her fifth and final score of the afternoon, but Dartmouth senior attacker Courtney Weisse, who is fourth in the conference for goals per game, found the back of the Harvard net twice in less than 30 seconds. Big Green sophomore midfielder Kathryn Giroux scored her second of the game as well to cut the Crimson’s lead to seven.
Sophomore midfielder Caroline Garrity and junior attacker Caroline Ashford gave Harvard some added security with a goal apiece, but Dartmouth refused to give up. Weisse completed her hat trick with just under five minutes remaining, and the Big Green would score three more goals before the final whistle.
Dartmouth’s final four goals capped a second stanza in which the Big Green outshot the Crimson, 19-15.
Luckily for Harvard, the first half could not have been more different. The team was able to weather Dartmouth’s comeback attempt after outpacing the Big Green, 9-2, in the opening period.
“I was proud of the way we built a lead early today and hung onto it for the win,” sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee said.
Dartmouth kicked off the scoring with two goals in the opening five minutes, sandwiched around McMahon’s first goal of the day.
The Crimson wouldn’t tie up the game for another five minutes, but once it did, the Harvard offense took over.
It was MacAfee who leveled the score at 2-2, slamming a shot into the roof of the Dartmouth net from close range.
The sophomore’s game-tying score marked the beginning of a 9-0 run for the Crimson. Just 20 seconds after MacAfee’s goal, Garrity cut through the entire Big Green defense with a weaving run before finding the back of the net to hand the Crimson a lead that it would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.
Romeo would go on to pick up three scores of her own and set up another, claiming an assist on MacAfee’s second goal of the day. Meanwhile, Hennessey netted two goals.
Behind the team’s attacking power, Harvard had built up a commanding seven-goal lead by halftime.
The Crimson didn’t let up in the first 15 minutes of the second half.
It took McMahon less than 30 seconds to reopen the scoring after the break, netting an unassisted strike at 29:37 in the second period.
Dartmouth would get two goals back before embarking on its comeback attempt, but each Big Green score was followed by two from Harvard.
First, Bourque rounded out her hat trick with 25:25 left to play. Sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco canceled out the Dartmouth goal, though. The New Vernon, N.J native found the top corner of the Big Green net and then picked out McMahon in front of goal with a lobbed pass.
McMahon finished the move with the goal of the game, scoring between her legs with her back to the net to complete her hat trick.
Giroux took a point back for Dartmouth, but Romeo returned the margin to 11 with a goal just 30 seconds later. Hennessey would also chip in her third goal of the game halfway through the stanza before the Big Green kicked off its 8-3 run.
The Crimson will take confidence from the fact that it was able to hold onto its lead as the team continues Ivy League play.
“I think this game will give us a lot of momentum,” Romeo said. “Lots of people stepped up today, and I think that will help us going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball traveled to Philadelphia and New York to kick off its 2017 Ivy League slate against conference foes Penn and Columbia. A year removed from finishing as the runner-up in the Ancient Eight, the Crimson faltered in its first two conference doubleheaders.
Led by clutch hitting from sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively and dominant pitching by sophomore southpaw Katie Duncan, Harvard (9-12, 1-3 Ivy) split two contests on Saturday with the Quakers (11-10, 2-2).
On Sunday, the Crimson dropped two games to the Lions (11-13, 4-0). Harvard’s bats could not mount an attack in the opening contest, and a seventh-inning Columbia rally sunk the Crimson in the final game of the weekend.
“I think this weekend was disappointing when we look at the end results,” sophomore outfielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer said. “We all know that we are more capable than what we showed these past four games. We have to keep the pressure on all seven innings in every single game we play.”
COLUMBIA 6, HARVARD 5
Untimely errors were Harvard’s downfall in the final game of the weekend’s four-game set. The Crimson committed four miscues, including two in the final frame, to allow the Lions to eke out a victory.
Heading into the bottom of the seventh, Harvard commanded a 5-2 advantage. After allowing baserunners to reach via an error and a walk, senior righthander Taylor Cabe was lifted in favor of sophomore Sarah Smith.
Attempting to lock down her third save of the season, Smith gave up a single through the right side, conceded a five-pitch walk, and then recorded a groundout to cut the Crimson lead to 5-4 with two outs and runners on second and third.
After taking a called strike, junior shortstop Madison Gott laced a single into right field. A miscue by junior Maddy Kaplan led freshman outfielder Amber Swinarski to race across home, delivering Columbia a walk-off win.
Errors plagued Harvard from the outset of the game. In the bottom of the first, Swinarski reached on an error by first baseman Jillian Leslie, and she crossed the plate as freshman outfielder Sommer Grzybek reached base on the Crimson’s second error of the inning.
Despite conceding four runs, two of which were earned, Cabe surrendered just two hits on the day.
Sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich went three-for-four with a run scored, an RBI, and a stolen base.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 1
After scraping for a 2-1 victory over Penn in the second half of Saturday’s doubleheader, Harvard’s bats continued to go silent in the team’s first matchup against the Lions.
Columbia’s starter, freshman Madison Canby, stymied the Crimson offense in a complete-game victory, her sixth of the season. Canby spread four hits over seven innings and punched out two.
“Columbia’s pitcher did a good job of hitting her spots and keeping the ball on the corners of the plate,” Rich said. “However, we had a lot of good at bats where we hit the ball hard, but we kept hitting them right to players. So [the] stats don't really show what we did well against her, but that's the game.”
In the top of the seventh, freshman first baseman Olivia Giaquinto smacked the first home run of her short career to spoil Canby’s shutout bid.
Duncan started her second game in a row after defeating Penn on Saturday. The sophomore held the Lions to two runs in 4.2 innings, but Harvard was unable to figure out Canby and provide Duncan sufficient run support.
HARVARD 2, PENN 1
In the second contest of the Saturday twin bill against the Quakers, the Crimson claimed its first Ancient Eight win of the season.
For the second time in two games, Harvard scored all its runs in the top of the first. Kaplan got the ball rolling with a double to left field, but she was cut down on the ensuing fielder’s choice by second-year third baseman Erin Lockhart. Back-to-back doubles from Schiffhauer and Shively brought in two runs.
Shively repeated her performance from the first game of the day, again going one-for-three with two runs batted in. This time, these two runs made all the difference in the outcome, as Duncan shut down Penn’s offense.
“Elizabeth and Katie played incredibly for us this weekend,” Schiffhauer said. “Elizabeth came up for us in a lot of clutch situations and came through every time, especially in our win.”
Duncan went the distance without allowing an earned run. The Allendale, N.J. native did not strike out any Quakers but only gave up four hits and a walk.
“Katie has been stepping up consistently for our team throughout the year, and we have to provide her with the run support she needs because she deserved two wins this weekend,” Schiffhauer added.
Penn’s lone run came on a three-base error and a subsequent single in the bottom of the sixth. With a runner on first, the Quakers threatened to tie the game at two, as senior first baseman Alexis Sargent smacked a double into right field. However, Kaplan’s throw caught Penn’s Jurie Joyner between second and third, and she was eventually tagged out to end the inning.
After the first inning doubles barrage, the Crimson only recorded one more hit in the game, a base knock by Giaquinto.
PENN 5, HARVARD 4
Harvard kicked off its 2017 Ivy League slate with a one-run loss to Penn in Philadelphia.
Jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the top of the first, the Crimson appeared to be in excellent position to put a rare blemish on Quaker ace Alexis Sargent’s record.
Shively roped a single through the left side to plate two, and two more runs scored on an error by Penn first baseman Sarah Cwiertnia and a sacrifice fly off the bat of senior designated hitter Catherine Callaway.
“Our game plan was just to go out swinging,” Rich said. “We saw her last year and knew we could hit her, so it was just a matter of coming out ready to swing our bats which we did really well the first inning. One good at bat led to the next and the momentum kept building.”
However, those four runs would be all the Harvard bats would muster in seven innings. Sargent regrouped after the first and allowed only three more hits on the day, all singles, en route to a complete game win. The senior struck out two in her sixth victory of the season.
Senior righthander Taylor Cabe flummoxed the Quakers’ batters through four innings, but Penn tacked on four runs of its own in the bottom of the fifth to knot the game at four. The Quakers pushed across another in their next turn at bat, and Sargent shut down the Crimson in the seventh to clinch the win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight week, Harvard women’s rugby’s tournament lives came down to a game against Quinnipiac University. For the second straight week, the Bobcats roared past the Crimson en route to a 7s tourney title.
Making the relatively short trip to western Mass. to participate in the AIC Invitational at American International College, Harvard won its pool and quarterfinal matchup relatively handily before getting knocked out in the championship semifinal, 39-0, against the two-time reigning national champions. But just like last weekend, the team can take positives from the tournament, which included stiffer competition than it saw last Saturday when the team hosted the Crimson 7s tournament.
QUINNIPIAC 39, HARVARD 0
In a reiteration of its position at the pinnacle of women’s rugby, Quinnipiac hardly let Harvard breathe before ending the Crimson’s chances at an upset. Besting its strong start from last weekend, the Bobcats struck first less than two minutes into the game, courtesy of Ilona Maher who scored the match’s first 17 points and was subsequently named the AIC Invitational MVP. A fourth try as time expired in the first half to put the game all but away.
As the 7s season gets underway, Harvard has been stressing a constant process of improvement, particularly on defense. But as this game clearly proved, the Crimson is the not the only team to be putting the pedal to the metal. Quinnipiac’s stifling play resulted in the first shutout of the season for Harvard, while presenting a fast-paced attack that other teams have no answer for.
“It would have been really easy to give, and say that we were tired and stop,” sophomore Caitlin Weigel said. “But we kept going. If there was a kickoff we were going to receive it and try our darndest to get through to the other side. But Quinnipiac definitely is sort of the standard at what collegiate 7s rugby is right now and we are going to keep working out and keep chipping away until we reach that standard as well.”
Last weekend when the Crimson played host to Quinnipiac, there was a semblance of competition as Harvard opened up the second half with a try. But this time the team would be blanked as its foe scored three more tries to seal the game. The rematch would also not provide the Crimson with any consolation, with no third place game or final try to end the contest. Returning the favor from last week, the Bobcats struck one last time as Harvard’s time in the tournament ended.
HARVARD 31, WEST CHESTER 7
After sweeping its three-team pool, Harvard ranked fourth and faced a bracket rematch against fifth-seed West Chester. Coincidentally, the Crimson played the same teams in the last two games of consecutive tournaments. As before, the results came out identically.
Despite the similarity, this game might have been Harvard’s brightest spot on the afternoon. After a defensive slugfest last weekend at Roberto A. Mignone Field, the Crimson blew the Golden Rams away on Sunday. Sophomore Rachel Harkavy scored two tries in the opening five minutes to take away intrigue from the bout. Two more tries, including one with :10 left in the half, catapulted Harvard into the semifinals.
Matching tries from the teams meant little, as West Chester faced an already insurmountable lead. The contest was a great display of the Crimson’s offensive prowess, as the team showed off good ball movement and tight cuts.
“West Chester was a really good game to see how much we had improved because the score was drastically different than last week. What really came together was our connection on set pieces and in open play we were anticipate where the next [open] space would be.”
The game also reaffirmed the team’s need to work on its defensive form. After all, in order to score, one needs possession of the ball. But if Harvard can become more tenacious without the ball, it has the potential to become a national contender, as last week’s game against Quinnipiac showed.
“This past week we’ve been really focused on positive tackles, getting hips square into the tackle so that we can drive them backwards,” Weigel said. “So that was something that we did accomplish this weekend. In almost all of our games we had positive tackles. The next step to building on the progress we’ve made is to get the ball back. When we’re pushing them backwards that’s our chance to be ball hungry and to go snatch the ball. So that’s going to be a point of improvement going forward on defense.”
HARVARD 12, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 5
Despite being just across the river, BU’s absence at the Crimson 7s resulted in some mystery as to how the matchup would turn out. The Crimson held seed in a tough and even contest, scoring a converted try with three minutes left in the first half to put the Cambridge squad up, 7-0, after a slow start to the game.
Indicative of the match, however, the Terriers did not go down without a fight and scored a try with around five minutes remaining. But a missed conversion by Regine Jacques, who initially scored the try, left Harvard with a narrow two-point lead. Harkavy played hero by responding with a try with a try two minutes later to give the Crimson more breathing room, which the team would use to seal out the game.
HARVARD 15, NORWICH A 0
Facing an unfamiliar opponent to start the day, the Crimson got off to a tenuous start. But Harkavy scored her first of five tries on the day exactly halfway through the first half. A missed conversion meant the game was up for grabs going into the second period.
Getting its engine going early in the morning, Harvard relied on its youth to jumpstart the team to an opening victory to prevent an upset. Freshmen Delia Hellander and Becky Soilson scored a try each to wake up the Crimson as it angled for another deep tournament run.
As the season progresses, the team cannot just rely on individual offensive contributions in order to be successful.
“There’s always room to improve,” senior Claire Collins alluded last Saturday. “We are going to work on improving our defense and improving our passing width.”
The team must gather together as unit, focusing not just on scoring but defense pressure and takeaways, as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team entered Ivy League play this weekend with a three-game win streak and a 10-8 record to its name. After its midweek clash with Holy Cross was postponed due to rain, the Crimson looked to continue its hot hitting as it traveled to Columbia and Penn for its first conference matchups of the year.
Unfortunately for the squad coming out of Cambridge, the team’s pronounced road woes continued, as it dropped all four games and saw its record away from home go to 1-11.
The Lions first downed Harvard, 2-0 and 5-1, on Saturday, which was followed by the red-hot Quakers defeating the Crimson, 4-0 and 7-4, on Sunday. Though Columbia and Penn are by no means top teams in the Ivy, the weekend’s games illustrated the unpredictability of conference play and the magnitude of the trek ahead for Harvard.
The weekend dropped the Crimson to 10-12 overall and an 0-4 start in Ivy play.
PENN 7, HARVARD 4
The visitor’s weekend closed out on a sour note, as Harvard saw an early 3-0 lead evaporate, and three-run innings in the home half of the second and seventh innings helped the streaking Quakers (11-9, 2-0 Ivy League) to a 7-4 nightcap win over the Crimson. The win was Penn’s ninth in a row.
Junior Matt Rothenberg opened the scoring for Harvard, doubling down the right-field line in the top of the first to score leadoff man senior Drew Reid, and senior Matt Hink followed with a two-RBI knock a few batters later to give the Crimson a 3-0 lead out of the gates.
The Quakers took one back in the bottom of the first, but the big blow came from Penn sophomore Matt O’Neill, who hit a three-run homer in the second inning to put the Quakers on top, 4-3.
Harvard freshman Quinn Hoffman tied the game with an RBI in the fourth, but three runs—one unearned—off freshman righty Grant Stone in the seventh gave Penn the series sweep.
PENN 4, HARVARD 0
The Crimson’s bats were silenced for the second time this weekend in Sunday’s opener, as Harvard’s offense was held to three hits in a 4-0 loss.
Sophomore outfielder Patrick Robinson had two of the Crimson’s three hits, but the rest of the lineup wasn’t able to rustle up enough support for starter Simon Rosenblum-Larson. The sophomore righty took the loss with a line of 5.0 innings pitched, six hits, and three earned runs given up.
Penn struck first on a bases-loaded single in the first and added insurance in the seventh with two more tallies to close out the scoring. Quaker senior Jake Cousins got the win on the mound, lowering his ERA to 1.42 in 30+ innings of work this season.
Combined with the nightcap, Penn lowered its team ERA to an Ivy League-leading 3.40.
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 1
Harvard punched in 11 hits but could only push one run across the plate in a 5-1 loss to Columbia (5-15, 2-2) in the Saturday nightcap.
Junior righty Noah Zavolas got the start for the Crimson and went 7.1 innings, but a four-run sixth inning in which eight Lions stepped up to the plate did most of the damage. Zavolas also struck out five in the loss.
Harvard had runners on the bags all day long—all but two innings saw the Crimson get at least one hit—but couldn’t convert.
In the fourth inning, with the bases loaded and one out, Reid hit a line drive that went straight to the shortstop and turned into an inning-ending double play. In the eighth, with two runners on and the tying run at the plate, freshman Chad Minato was picked off at second base to end the Crimson’s threat.
COLUMBIA 2, HARVARD 0
Coming off a huge scoring outburst against Army and being shut out a week later, 2-0, by a pitching staff that sported a team ERA of 6.22, perhaps took Harvard aback and deflated the rest of its weekend.
In Saturday’s opener, the Crimson slotted emerging ace junior Ian Miller and threw out a lineup against Columbia akin to the ones that scored in the double digits against Army.
While Miller threw six innings—yet another complete game, part of an abbreviated seven-inning game—and gave up just two earned runs, the offense mustered just three hits and two walks in the loss.
Sophomore lefty Josh Simpson went the distance for the Lions as well, scattering three hits over seven innings and shutting Harvard out. The pitcher’s duel ended in the Lion’s favor after a sac fly in the first and an RBI single in the fifth gave Columbia a two-run advantage.
Miller’s 2.92 ERA is the only average under four on Harvard’s pitching staff.

Matthew Young may seem like just another tutor living in Pfoho. And, by day, he is. But by night he takes on a new persona, and with it, a new title: the Guinea Pig Sheriff of Pfoho. You might ask, what the hell does this mean? It's admittedly kind of hard to explain, but we like to thing of Young as the Batman of guinea pig caretakers; the cage is his Gotham, and he is hell-bent on ensuring justice, or at least good care, is carried out.
Of course, while this job comes with many perks (the title for one), it also comes with a host of challenges and responsibilities. It’s not all fun and games when it comes to enforcing guinea pig law—sometimes you have to get your hands dirty. And that’s why we couldn’t pass up the chance to get an exclusive interview with the Guinea Pig Sheriff of Pfoho and hear it from the legend himself. 
What are your responsibilities as Guinea Pig Sheriff?  
MY: Pfoho has pfour guinea pigs. Their names are Pfiona, Pfoebe, Penelope aka Penny, and Piper. The Guinea Pig Sheriffs and Deputies ensure that our piggies are well-fed, groomed, and ready to engage with students and visitors. Pfolks can visit them any time as we keep them in a common space. My deputy sheriffs also help with clipping nails and shampooing.
If you visit, they request that you bring some tasty veggies or fruits. Carrots and green leafy veggies especially welcome.
What are the qualifications needed to become the sheriff?
MY: You must first make an offering of tasty veggies or fruits. Then you must become skilled in the art of grooming and shampooing the piggies.
During your time as guinea pig sheriff, have you ever really had to lay down the law?
MY: Yes—sometimes the piggies will get a little aggressive with each other when all four are together, so we keep Pfoebe and Penny separate because they do not get along.
As guinea pig sheriff can you arrest people too, or just guinea pigs?
MY: Only piggies who have wandered out of their playroom. It would be considered false imprisonment to arrest people.
How has being the guinea pig sheriff changed you?
MY: It's been great—students from all the Quad houses and many of the River houses come and spend time with our piggies. Many regard it as a Transformative Experience. My hope is one day they'll become famous and end up on the Harvard Memes page.
In the end, Matthew is the hero these guinea pigs deserve, need, and have; a symbol of hope and an inspiration to us all. Maybe we should all find the guinea pig sheriff within.
