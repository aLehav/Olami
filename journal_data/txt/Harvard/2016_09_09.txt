After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“Our mission here is not only to support the best artist but to support creative engagement and art making,” says Jack Megan, director for the Office of the Arts at Harvard. The day is Sept. 3, just several hours before the Student Involvement Fair, and Megan is anticipating a large turnout at the OFA’s table. For him, helping freshmen find their artistic niches is part of his job, but his contributions exist within a larger narrative of artistic outreach.
The introduction of freshmen to the on-campus arts scene begins with the First-Year Arts Program, a pre-orientation program offered by the Freshman Dean’s Office that includes five days of workshops and masterclasses with resident artists, culminating in a pageant—all in the hope that the students will receive a holistic experience and forge new connections with fellow creatives. “FAP is all about taking people who really, really care about art… and giving them an opportunity… to get to know their peers,” says Eden H. Girma ’18, a proctor for the music division (referred to in-program as the music thread). What Girma likes most about FAP are its efforts to push students to explore beyond their comfort zones.
“I really liked the program because we got to expose ourselves to many different types of arts,” says Nadine Khoury ’20, who participated in FAP. “I went in really passionate about piano and composition… but while we were there, we all got to dabble with things that we may not have dabbled with before.”
For those unable to attend FAP, and even for those who do, the OFA provides additional support. According to Megan, the OFA staffs booths at various fairs, runs an open house, and offers individual counseling. “We can tell [how many freshmen we’re reaching by] students who come sign up for our newsletter,” he says. “This year, so far, without the activities fair, we have got over 800 students signed up for the arts newsletter, which is called The Beat, so we’ve got about 50% of the class that is linked to that resource.”
In addition to formal outreach efforts by the school administration, student organizations launch campaigns to introduce freshmen to artistic opportunities through fliers and showcases such as LMAO (a performance for the comedy groups) and the Freshman A Cappella Jam.  “We’re always trying to find new ways to reach out to freshmen,” says Sarah K. Murphy ’17, president of the Radcliffe Pitches. “We’re trying to build more of a social media presence… to help project more of the personal side to the group.”
Karen L. Chee ’17, the Czar (or president) of the improv troupe Immediate Gratification Players, shares Murphy’s sentiment. “This year, we’ve been making a larger social media push than we have in prior years,” she says.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club introduced more significant changes. According to president Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, the HRDC moved the Common Casting process from its traditional Monday-to-Friday schedule to a Tuesday-to-Saturday system in order to give freshmen time to prepare even if they learn about auditions at the Student Involvement Fair. Furthermore, the organization implemented a mentorship program this year in an attempt to provide support to freshmen. “As a freshman, I had a different experience going to my first round of auditions, where I showed up and everyone already knew each other for some reason,” she says. “I wanted to make sure that [this would not be] an experience that was so common.”
Brophy’s comment highlights an attentiveness to diversity and inclusion that echoes throughout the conversation surrounding freshman outreach. The Harvard Art Museums, for instance, regularly partner with the FDO to organize workshops and private gallery tours for students, also  planning events such “Late Night at the Harvard Art Museums” on Thursday, Sept. 8. Through such programming, the museums hope to attract students of all disciplines. “In general, we really want students, in particular first-year students, to know that the museum is a place for them,” Erin Northington, manager of student engagement programs, says. “We want students to know that no matter what you study, no matter what your background is, you don’t need prior experience to be [at the Museums].”
“There’s been a real push towards trying to make the opportunity to do art as accessible as possible to anyone,” Megan says. “How do we break down walls that would suggest a sense of exclusion?”
Responses to general outreach efforts have been mixed, however. “I would say that the majority of Opening Days, we didn’t hear about anything related to the arts,” Allison Kao ’20 says. Kao, who participated in FAP, adds that the program helped smooth her transition into the arts scene.
Singer-songwriter Avanti S. Nagral ’20 expresses similar concerns. While she is very impressed by the artistic resources and level of creative support at Harvard, she points out that she would have liked more active outreach, suggesting targeted introductory events beyond the generality of an open house, or even a survey that would inform the school how to more specifically advise freshmen on their interests. “I’m sure [such events] will happen later in the year, but perhaps if they could happen earlier in the year, people could wrap their minds around [the opportunities in the arts],” she says.
Megan, in an emailed response, expressed his concerns that some freshmen didn’t hear much about the arts, though he reemphasized that the showing at the OFA tables during orientation fairs were quite strong.
Despite the criticisms, other students have had more positive experiences. While Khoury says that FAP gave her a more comprehensive understanding of the arts scene on campus, she adds that she likely would have been able to find her place even without formal outreach efforts like the program.
And Nagral views the opportunities for the arts on campus—both academically and extracurricularly—with excitement. “I think it’s beautiful that at Harvard, you have the opportunity to… explore a different side [of campus life],” she says. “Many people [here] could have easily come to Julliard… and it’s beautiful that Harvard supports people who are so passionate about the arts… and allows them the freedom to explore their academics and interests.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a college student, I often worry about competing in the job market and wonder where to start when you need job experience before you can get job experience. It seems as though the more experience you have, the more likely you should be to get hired; this certainly makes sense. At a certain point, however, the opposite is true, particularly for women.
Older women are significantly less likely to get hired, despite a built up wealth of experience. The effects of this can be particularly damaging since women earn less throughout their lives. Losing a job and then finding difficulty re-entering the workforce in their fifties means that women might have a more difficult time amassing enough savings for retirement.
Several studies have researched this barrier to entry for older women. A study done by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis examined the effects of the recession on long-term unemployment across age and gender. Their data shows that the long term unemployment-to-unemployment ratio for older women increased from 14% to 50% following the recession. Although the study suggests that the large increase could be due to sampling errors, the general trend is that a higher proportion of unemployed older women have been unemployed for long periods of time. And even as the economy is improving and people are returning to work, older women are nevertheless having a more difficult time when it comes to hiring.
It's possible that companies may be unwilling to hire older workers because they would want an employee to work for a longer period of time. They may also assume they would have to pay an older worker more than a younger worker because of his or her experience. These reasons don't, however, explain the differences noted between older men and older women.
Another recent study done by David Neumark, Ian Burn, and Patrick Button through the National Bureau of Economic Research highlighted this same issue. In the study, summarized in this Forbes article, researchers sent out 40,000 fake applications for jobs across 12 cities in the office administration, retail sales, security guard, and janitor. The applicants were in three age categories. The study found that callback rates were 35 percent lower for older applicants compared to their younger competitors and "robust evidence of age discrimination against older women." When interviewed, Neumark stated that he was “surprised by the weaker evidence of age discrimination towards men.”
But it’s not really that surprising when you consider social values and expectations that underpin these hiring practices.
Neumark and his coworkers suggest that age discrimination laws don’t sufficiently address the issues that women face, allowing the problem to persist as an explanation for this discrimination. One other reason is that people may assume that women have taken time off to care for children, therefore leaving them with less professional experience than men of their age.
Here are two areas where concrete steps can be taken to solve a visible issue. Currently, only 12 percent of people working in the U.S. private sector are eligible for paid family leave through their work. If companies began offering paid leave for both parents (currently even U.S. paid maternity leave is lacking compared to other countries) once a child is born, this could start shifting societal expectation for responsibility of child care more evenly between men and women. Women wouldn’t face a disadvantage in being expected to take time off from work to care for a child and penalized if they do. Plus, this action would help avoid setting up the choice that many women feel they must make: Between a job and raising children. And we could do more to ensure that age discrimination laws more effectively address the needs of women.
Another reason for this discrimination cited by the study is the role of appearance for women. In our society, we wrongly attribute value to women based on their appearance. We also believe that age detracts from beauty, particularly for women. Thus we devalue women as soon as their appearance is altered in a supposedly unflattering way due to age. The perception of older women as less attractive and appealing and therefore less “good” harms them when looking for a job, whether or not that decision is a conscious thought process on the part of the person hiring. It’s a correlation that we often see reflected in popular culture, and even in a lot of the stories we grew up hearing as children. Old equals ugly equals evil, especially in the context of an old witches.
The issue of discriminatory hiring practices against older women is not one widely discussed, but it is an important one, particularly because there are several problems in our society that interact to culminate in this one larger issue. Truly providing equal opportunities for older women involves examining and addressing the issues that cause and allow these hiring practices to exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a mere 300 alumni signatures, Ron K. Unz ’83 and four other alumni launched the failed “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign for the Board of Overseers over this past spring. The campaign argued for abolishing undergraduate tuition and increasing public data on Harvard admissions practices, claiming that Asian-American students were being discriminated against by affirmative action. The platform received almost immediate criticism from President Faust and a group of nearly 500 alumni soon followed Faust’s lead.
Unz’s high-profile petition campaign drew attention to more than tuition and admissions, however. It sparked renewed interest in the election process and signature qualification. The voting population for the Board of Overseers includes approximately 265,000 alumni who have received a degree from Harvard, but until recently, only 201 signatures were required to gain a spot on the ballot as a petition candidate. In the aftermath of this election, the University will move to raise the bar for petition candidates to one percent of the that population— 2,650 signatures. Candidates will also be limited to those who have received a degree from the University, and the University will move its voting and signature processes online.
Traditionally, alumni mailed in paper ballots, and signatures for petition candidates had to be collected on official, watermarked forms. The move towards digitalization will remedy these anachronisms. Given the Board of Overseers' crucial role in the University’s present and future, we strongly support these technology-guided initiatives and believe they will increase turnout. However, we do not believe that these changes justify the tenfold increase in requirements for petition signatures.
Despite the unconventional nature of Unz’s platform, discouraging the input of outside voices will harm the University in the long run. Overseer election turnout has traditionally been low, with only 35,870 ballots cast in the 2016 election, though the extent to which digitalization will aid voter turnout remains unclear. The jump of the petition signature requirement to 2,650—approximately seven percent of last year’s vote total— could therefore prove too high a barrier for petition candidates in the future.
While we did not support the "Free Harvard, Fair Harvard" ticket, we see the value in  petition candidates to help to spark critical discussion on issues overlooked by the Harvard-suggested candidates. While it is important to have a threshold that prevents unpopular candidates from crowding the election, it is also important to recognize that it is nearly-impossible for an outsider candidate to be elected. The platform of candidacy serves the greater function of protest and should not be subject to unnecessarily high restrictions.
We therefore propose that the University instead adopt a signature threshold of one percent of the previous election’s turnout. This will allow the requirement to fluctuate with the number of actual voters, reasonably filtering candidates while still allowing for inclusiveness. In the meantime, we hope the University will continue to adopt initiatives that increase alumni engagement and election participation. Greater alumni participation will benefit the operation of the University whose people—students, faculty, and alumni—are its greatest asset.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening Days has been hectic for us as freshmen, newly arrived in Cambridge. We run all over campus for early morning meetings with our entryways, speak up (perhaps) in our Community Conversations, and are inundated with waves of topically useless information. As we read pamphlets and sit in meetings, we are reminded that we—the class of 2020—are the newest members of the community and everyone is excited to welcome us into our new home.
But there is also a flip side to these idyllic first impressions of the College. Last Friday, as we walked through Cambridge Common on our way back from the Activities Fair, we saw a man lying on a bench in the middle of the park. Normally, this wouldn’t have been an abnormal sight, but he was surrounded by four or five other men, some of whom were pounding on his chest and shouting at him. He appeared unresponsive. We were unsure if we should intervene; but recalling the “bystander effect,” we shared a glance of mutual understanding and ran over.
Most of his friends kept stumbling, mumbling incoherent nonsense. By the time we got to the bench, three other passersby had taken notice, one of whom seemed to know CPR and had begun compressions on the man’s chest. He didn’t look good; his lips were blue and his eyelids were peeled, irises dialed back to the point where no one could see them. None of us knew what was going on, but we tried our best to help. While one of us called 911, the other kept the man’s friends away from the woman performing CPR. They were yelling at her and kept trying to pound on the man’s chest despite her precise pumps.
The man’s eyes were still rolled back and his muscles weren’t moving—he looked like a ragdoll, lying there motionless. His friends became more and more panicked in a muted, helpless sort of way. Fighting amongst one another, one of them barked at the woman. "She doesn’t know what she’s doing” and "you’re not supposed to pump 36 times, you’re gonna kill him…have you ever dealt with a fucking heroin overdose? Don’t think so.” After a few tense moments, the man started to cough and his arm twitched. When she had begun CPR, she had been shouting that he didn’t have a pulse. 
The sound of sirens pierced the hysteria of the growing crowd. Two ambulances and a police car had pulled up next to the park. The pace of the paramedics and police officers was notably slow, walking over to the crowd, before ultimately venturing a “Well, we’re here now.” This is not intended to disparage the hard-working men and women of the Cambridge Police Department or first responders, but their lackluster effort to attend to this man could have meant the difference between life and death.
Perhaps this lack of haste was because the man was breathing again. Perhaps it was because they see similar situations everyday. Perhaps it was because this man and his cohort were repeat victims. Whatever the reason, the simple fact is that they did not hasten to his side.
One paramedic asked if he “shot up regularly,” to which a man in the crowd answered that he did and that he probably had a needle on him at this very moment. Indeed, his arms were covered in what looked like track marks. He had no shoes on; his clothes were soiled and torn. 
After we got the names of the people who helped for the police, we continued back into the Yard, a gated oasis from the outside. Less than a block away, a man had been fighting for his life. 
We wondered: Why had the response time been so slow? Why had the paramedics not rushed over? Why was this happening so close to the place we’re now supposed to call home? After all, we’re conditioned to think: “This is Harvard. This isn’t supposed to happen here.” 
The reality is, however, that it does happen here. Massachusetts’s opioid overdose rate is two times the national average. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 488 people have died of heroin and opioid related overdose in the first six months of 2016. This epidemic is disturbingly common in the Commonwealth: the overdose rate is roughly 4.5 people per day. Despite Governor Baker’s efforts, there has been no marked impact on the problem. Nothing seems to be working and the widespread adage “rags to rags to rags” has taken on a redoubling, cyclical nature across Massachusetts.
And what of the man on the bench? After he was taken away by paramedics, what becomes of him? We can only speculate. Perhaps he will receive the necessary treatment to overcome his addiction. It is more likely, however, that he will be spit back out onto the streets, without the support system he needs.
We cannot let this lack of solutions engender us with an attitude of passivity. We cannot, as new members of this community, opt for inaction, looking over our shoulder as the problems of the less fortunate pass us by. We live here now. We are Harvard’s newest class. Supposedly the best and the brightest. The pomp and circumstance that greeted us these past few weeks should not and cannot blind us to the needs of those around us—and those needs do not stop at Johnston Gate.
We must be aware of what goes on in our new community—the good, the bad, and the ugly. It is all too easy at a place like Harvard to view the world through crimson-colored glasses. We cannot hide behind the red brick walls of our dorms and live in blissful ignorance of the pains of our community, while pretending to be the educated and upstanding generation of tomorrow. It is imperative that we open our eyes to everyone at Harvard.
Let us heed T.S. Eliot’s warning from “The Wasteland,” lest this place become a “rats’ alley / Where the dead men [lose] their bones.” Let us all be active members in our community, concerned with the betterment of our home as we start this new chapter in our lives as Harvard students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 10, 2016, at 3:56 p.m.
Asian American Studies has historically seen little representation at the College, but this fall students can take at least four courses in the field, offered roughly a semester after a group of undergraduates began pushing for more awareness in the discipline.
Harvard has no formal Asian American studies program, so a group of undergraduates last winter created a task force called the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies, which advocates for more curricular offerings. The courses offered this fall are housed in History, History and literature, Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and the College’s newest concentration, Theater, Dance, and Media. 
Terry K. Park, a lecturer in History and Literature, is teaching History & Literature 90cm: “Asian American Cultural Studies.” New to Harvard, he comes to the College as a specialist in a field with no department or tenured faculty. But the presence of a growing group of professors in Asian American studies could make a difference for its future at Harvard, Park said.
“I think there’s a small cohort of Asian American studies faculty, and hopefully it will show the administration that there’s strong interest among students, that there are faculty that are committed to help grow Asian American Studies,” Park said.
Park said that he applied for the job, in part, because assistant professor, Genevieve A. Clutario, who was previously a College Fellow, encouraged him to do so. This semester, Clutario is teaching two Asian American studies courses, one in History and one in History and Literature.
Undergraduate task force co-coordinator Sidney C. Li ’19 said he thinks much of the faculty support for the discipline comes from History and Literature, but in the future the task force would like to draw support from a broader range of departments, such as Sociology and Government.
Another class offered this semester is the result of a first-time collaboration between WGS and the Theater, Dance, and Media. New College Fellow Vivian L. Huang is teaching TDM 1229/WGS 1229: “Asian American Theater and Performance.”
“Before coming here I wasn’t aware that there wasn’t a formal Asian American studies program, and I was shocked, honestly,” Huang said. “I know that Harvard isn’t the only institution of excellence that doesn’t have a formal discipline for this, but I was surprised because it is a university of such high repute, and in this incoming class 1 of 4 students identifies as Asian American.”
Deborah Foster, the Director of Undergraduate Studies for TDM said she was excited about the prospect of searching for a joint College Fellow with WGS, and said the courses Huang is teaching this year are a valuable addition to both programs.
“We are interested in theater at Harvard going beyond its Western traditions. TDM is intent on broadening its scope in that regard,” Foster said.
Huang is currently only contracted for one year, but Foster said she hopes funding will continue for  the joint WGS and TDM College Fellows program.
In addition to pushing for more courses in the discipline, the undergraduate task force also hopes to fundraise in the future, according to co-coordinator Juhwan Seo ’17. He said he hopes to work with alumni groups, such as the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, to raise money for faculty positions and a research center.
Seo said the group also plans to host events similar to last semester’s teach-ins roughly every two weeks in order to help increase student interest in Asian American studies.
While Li said he would be interested in pursuing a secondary in Asian American Studies, he said he thinks it is unlikely an official program could be created before his time at the College ends.
“There’s a very long path we have to go down.There’s no infrastructure for this kind of thing at Harvard,” he said, though he remains optimistic about the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard must produce “comprehensive data” from six full admissions cycles for use in the pending admissions lawsuit between the University and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions following a court order filed Tuesday.
Students for Fair Admissions launched the lawsuit in 2014, alleging that the University’s admissions process discriminates against Asian American applicants by setting quotas. Progress on the lawsuit remained largely stagnant over the past few months as the court awaited the Supreme Court ruling on a similar case, Fisher vs. The University of Texas at Austin. The discovery process has also prolonged the case as both parties have requested the release of certain documents and data. 
On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs ordered Harvard to produce “data from its admissions database,” which includes student applications, from the 2009-2010 admissions cycle through to the 2014-2015 cycle. The order said the University must also provide more limited data from the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 cycles in addition to specific data from admissions “fields,” which remain unknown because of a court-ordered seal.
The court order does not explicitly define “comprehensive data,” which in July SFFA had originally requested for eight admissions cycles. In response, Harvard filed a request arguing that the release of “personal information about each of the more than 35,000 individual applicants in a given year’s admissions cycle” could infringe on privacy. In addition, Harvard argued that releasing so much data was unnecessary given the amount of aggregate demographic data on applicants and admitted students that the University makes public.
Burroughs also ordered Harvard to produce “discovery relating to any prior investigations, reports, or official responses regarding alleged discrimination against Asian-American applicants.” The order indicates that this information includes all material relating to any internal and external investigations into allegations of discrimination against Asian-Americans in the undergraduate admissions process.
But Judge Burroughs ruled that Harvard is not obliged to produce materials related to discrimination against Jewish applicants from the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s, information Students for Fair Admissions had previously requested. Burroughs wrote she was uncertain such information is “relevant to the invidious discrimination claims in this case, which allege that Harvard is presently discriminating against Asian-American applicants.”
Additionally, legal counsel for SFFA will not have access to academic data on students who matriculated to the College, according to the judge’s order.
Stetson University law professor Peter F. Lake ’81 said while the order for release of information is not unusual in the discovery process, he was surprised by what the judge ordered not to be released.
“I thought that limiting discovery and not allowing the tracking of students who’ve been admitted was interesting, and I have a feeling that that’s going to be a little controversial going forward,” he said. Lake said he thought data on matriculating students could “potentially validate decisions on individuals or show patterns of some kind of behavior.”
Following the Fisher vs. Texas ruling, in which the Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admissions process of the University of Texas was lawful, admissions data will become more important to admissions-based discrimination litigation, Lake said.
“I think that the generalized attack on race-conscious admissions as being unlawful is now essentially over for this generation,” he said. “I think we are going to see courts looking more at what’s happening inside the the inner sanctum of the admissions process.”
Spokespeople from both Students for Fair Admissions and Harvard’s Admissions Office declined to comment on the recent court order, although University President Drew G. Faust and other administrators have previously defended the Harvard’s admission policies.
Despite the court order, the lawsuit may continue to proceed slowly. Discovery information and all designated experts for the case can be submitted up until Sept. 18, 2017, according to a schedule filed by Judge Burrough’s office on Sept. 1, which could prolong a ruling until 2018.

Winthrop House residents have spread out to swing housing across Harvard Square this semester as House renewal resumes in earnest after a yearlong hiatus.
The construction on Winthrop, which began in late May as part of a more than $1 billion project to renovate Harvard's upperclassman Houses, is “moving along as planned” according to Stephen Needham, Harvard’s senior director of project management. The  renovations will expand existing living spaces in the House, create new common areas, and erect Beren Hall, a new building that will extend Gore Hall to the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets. Beren Hall will open following the August 2017 completion of the rest of the House. 
In the interim, students are residing in swing housing. The bulk of sophomores are staying in the Harvard Inn (now called the Harvard “Winn”) and upperclassmen are dispersed among apartment-style buildings in the Square.
Winthrop Faculty Deans Stephanie Robinson and Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. said students are satisfied with the swing space.
“We are very pleased, and students seem to be really happy at least so far with swing,” Robinson said. “Our sophomores are just like, ‘I never want to leave this place.’”
Katie B. Kohn, a resident tutor in Winthrop, said, “Thropians really love not having pests, at least in the Prescott building, the rooms are clean and clear. I’ve heard horror stories already from Eliot students, I guess the cockroaches in Winthrop moved there.”
Ketura Webb ’19 said she appreciates her air-conditioned dorm and the Inn’s spacious dining hall.
Though residents are overall happy with swing space, some worry the scattered locations—over six different locations, according to Robinson—will diminish house community.
“I think it’s an anticipation that everyone has had because it’s part of the unique nature of a residential college,” Robinson said. “We all are planning to do what we can to enhance the opportunity for all of the House members to come together.”
Manizha Kholmatov ’17 said that while she is glad to have the larger apartment-style space, especially as a senior who is preparing to transition into independent adult life, she does feel the absence of having the dining hall physically located right in her House.
“It feels much more separate,” Kholmatov said. “The last couple years I was in Winthrop, the dining hall was kind of a central hub for students, where people would meet up and see each other, do work, and socialize. And although that may still be the case for those in the Inn, it does feel different not having that right there.”
Robinson said she and Sullivan have “charged” students with thinking of ways to fortify House community over the course of the next year. Already, Winthrop has thrown a “block party” for residents with carnival-style games and Boston-themed with food like “Fenway dogs.”
Matthew D. Disorbo ’17, one of Winthrop’s House Committee co-chairs, wrote in an email that the College is “very interested in supporting Winthrop during swing housing.”
“We are confident the proudest House at Harvard will flourish in swing,” he wrote.
As of March, the years-long House renewal project, a touted priority in Harvard's record-breaking capital campaign, had raised $230 million—or a little more than half of its overall goal.

UPDATED: September 9, 2016, at 11:26 a.m.
In early September, Cory Ransom ’19 received an emailed invitation from the A.D. Club that requested “the company of sophomore men” for the club’s Sept. 13 punch event.
The A.D. is a 180-year old all-male final club. Ransom is a 19-year-old woman living in Adams House.
The A.D.’s apparent gaff underscores—albeit humorously—many of the questions surrounding final clubs and gender in one of the last fall recruitment, or “punch,” seasons before a new College policy begins to penalize single-gender clubs.
This fall, the club is holding an “open” punch—any interested males may participate, as opposed to the hand-selected crop of years past—for the first time in its long history. Because the College does not recognize final clubs, the A.D. cannot publicize its open punch through traditional methods such as postering in College spaces and tabling at activity fairs. Instead, it had to get creative. In addition to emailed invitations, the A.D. bought advertisements in both the print edition of The Crimson and its webpage. 
When Ransom learned that none of her female suitemates had also received the A.D.’s email, she speculated about what had actually happened.
“From the looks of it, it seems like they just went through and picked every masculine name [to email],” Ransom said.
A.D. graduate president Kenneth G. Bartels ’76 and undergraduate president Philip Zielonka ’17 declined to comment on how they compiled the invitation list.
After talking it over with her suitemates, Ransom decided to RSVP to the event despite its stipulation that the event was only for sophomore men. With the help of fellow sophomore Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, Ransom composed a “very very posh” RSVP email. To their surprise, the A.D. confirmed her RSVP, apparently ignoring the image of a dress-clad Ransom that serves as her Gmail thumbnail.
Ransom has since started started a tongue-in-cheek Facebook event titled “THE PUNCH: the True Story of a GIRL named Cory.” On the event’s page, which lists more than 70 people “attending,” Ransom has posted light-hearted updates and jokes about the mix-up. Captioning a screenshot of the A.D.’s email confirming her RSVP, Ransom wrote “I guess no one in the AD has a facebook…”
Ransom’s case and others like it—she says she knows of several other non-male identifying students who received the A.D.’s initial email—illustrates the challenges for a club like the A.D. operating a single-gender open punch on a campus increasingly uncomfortable with traditional notions of gender.Gender issues are certainly not unique to final clubs—the Krokodiloes, an all-male a cappella group, recently gave a woman a callback to their auditions for the first time, kicking off a discussion within the a cappella community about single-gender policies.
Indeed, Ransom says her playful social media campaign is aimed at urging people to stop “assuming gender based on arbitrary things that have no connection.”
“Since there’s been so much tension and everything surrounding final clubs, I kind of wanted to make it a little bit of comedic relief while still addressing an issue,’” Ransom said.
The A.D.’s mistake may be the most visible stumbling block so far in the first punch season since the College’s announcement of historic sanctions, which, starting with the Class of 2021, will penalize student involvement in unrecognized single-gender social groups.
Still, many final club anticipated having at least one barrier to starting off their punch season. The Harvard College Facebook—an internal student directory clubs have traditionally used to find the addresses of first-round punches and slip  invitations under their dorm room door—did not include student dorm numbers until recently as a result of a technical error, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
The Porcellian Club will also host an open punch for sophomore men this semester, a graduate officer of the Porcellian Club declined to comment on their plans for inviting people to their first event.
As for Ransom, she says that unless the A.D. offers her an apology for the mix-up, she will attend the first punch event on Tuesday evening at the Sheraton Commander. Though the club’s invitation calls for coat and tie, Ransom said she would probably opt for a “really simple,” “really classy” black dress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the student activities fair in the rearview mirror and club comp processes in full swing, 31 new student organizations are embarking this fall on their first academic year as clubs Harvard College officially recognizes.
The organizations were among 38 groups that sought official recognition from the College last year, according to David R. Friedrich,  associate dean of student life. Thirteen were approved in the fall, when five were deferred or rejected, and 18 were approved in the spring, when two were deferred or rejected. There are currently more than 400 recognized student groups on campus.
“Based on the context of limited space, time, and resources, we’re trying to help encourage the things that address an unmet need or interest, and push back on the things that are just going to duplicate what already exists,” Friedrich said.
The Committee on Student Life, which is composed of faculty and students, evaluated groups based on a rubric of 11 criteria, according to Friedrich. He said the rubric includes adherence to the University’s non-discrimination policy and demonstrated benefits for members and the campus at large.
Friedrich added that the process is more rigorous now compared to past years.
“When we look back over a 10-year period, five of those years we saw a tremendous increase in the number of student groups on campus,” he said. “But about the past five years, things have held pretty steady. And again, I think it gets back to this idea of balance, in the context of prioritizing academics.”
The approved groups vary widely in their focus, as well as their size. They include pre-professional, arts, and social justice organizations.
Harvard Fusian, a new East Asian-interest a capella group approved last spring, seeks to expand opportunities in a cappella, according to the group’s co-founder, Sindy C. Tan ’17.
“There’s a really big East Asian population at Harvard, where there are a lot of people who probably share our interests in K-pop and anime,” she said.
The group is holding auditions for five to six open spots next week, Tan said.
Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics is another student group approved the Committee approved last year. According to its co-president, Amanda K. Glazer ’18, the group aims to increase diversity in the Math Department, which includes primarily male concentrators and faculty.
Inspired by a survey from in 2015 revealing the gender gap issue, Glazer and co-president Vikram Sundar ’17 worked with Meena K. Boppana ’16 to form the group. They kicked off a speaker series focused on issues women face in mathematics last year.
Convrgency, a new student group that focuses on using virtual reality technology in the arts, is preparing for a showcase later this year, its president Connor Doyle ’19 said.
According to him, the group plans to use the showcase to demonstrate the potential for virtual reality to produce original media content, gauge interest in the club, and further strategize which applications of virtual reality the group will emphasize.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court Justice and former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan returned to her old stomping ground Thursday to reflect on her experience on the bench and and impart advice to incoming students.
A crowd of mostly first-year and Masters of Law students packed the Milstein Conference Center Thursday afternoon to hear Kagan take part in a question-and-answer session with Law School Dean Martha L. Minow.
“It’s one of the greatest pleasures of my life as dean to be able to welcome back a former dean,” Minow said. “There are so many thanks to you for what you have done for legal education and this school.”
Kagan, who graduated from the Law School in 1986, returned to the school as a professor in 1999 before becoming dean in 2003. She held the position until 2009, when President Barack Obama appointed her United States Solicitor General, and then to the Supreme Court in 2010. During her tenure as dean, Kagan expanded the faculty, oversaw construction of the school’s student center, implemented a major overhaul of the curriculum, and—as Minow pointed out to cheers from the audience—introduced free coffee for Law School affiliates.
Serving as a Supreme Court justice is a narrower, more predictable job than that of a law school dean, Kagan told the audience as she reflected on her time.
“[As dean] you’re required to be all kinds of different people doing all kinds of different jobs,” she said. “I used to think that was the best part of being dean—I got to flex different muscles.”
The justice alternated solemnity with well-received humor in her responses to Minow’s questions. She contrasted her job as dean with serving on the Supreme Court, described the difficulties of an eight-person court, recounted fond memories of former Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia, and poked fun at her responsibilities as the court’s youngest justice.
Kagan jokingly complained to students about the “special duties” she is required to perform as the junior Justice, which include overseeing the Court’s cafeteria committee.
“You get onto this court and you think you’re an important person, but then you have to spend over an hour a month thinking about chocolate chip cookies,” she said.
On a more serious note, Kagan described the challenges of a split court. Scalia’s death in February—and the subsequent refusal of Congress to approve federal judge and Harvard Law alumnus Merrick B. Garland ’74 as his replacement—left the country’s highest court with just eight members.
“There’s a reason why appellate courts have an odd number of members,” Kagan said. “A tie does nobody any good.”
The justice spoke of her friendship with Scalia, with whom she became close despite holding widely-diverging positions on politics and the law. The two went on hunting trips together to Wyoming and Virginia in their free time, and last November, Kagan returned to the Law School to deliver the annual lecture named for Scalia.
Kagan concluded the event by urging new Law students to use their time at the school to engage with classmates with whom they disagree.
“Talk to your classmates, especially those with different views,” Kagan told students. “Even if you come away from it disagreeing even more, at least you know what makes them tick, which is a useful thing.”
First-year student Michael Lemm appreciated Kagan’s advice, and said he was glad she recounted her friendship with Scalia. Lemm said the friendship demonstrated the importance of engaging with people with varying viewpoints.
Kagan is a role model for Aaima Asad, an LLM student from Pakistan who attended the event.
“[I’m here] just to listen to the firsthand experiences of a legend, especially from a female empowerment point of view. I come from a country... where no women are on the Supreme Court right now. Pakistan is a very patriarchal society,” Asad said. “It’s interesting to see females who made it.”
Kagan was the first female dean of the Law School, and the first female Solicitor General of the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Incumbents were overwhelmingly victorious in Thursday’s state primaries, including in a hotly contested local race between Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung and the incumbent of 11 years, State Senator Patricia D. Jehlen.
The district, which covers parts of Cambridge, Somerville and other towns, featured one of the hardest fought races in the state, which often centered on debate regarding charter schools. Massachusetts Democrats remain split on November’s Question 2 ballot initiative, which would increase the cap on new charter schools to 12 a year, while Republicans including Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker ’79 generally support the measure.
Cheung, a supporter of Question 2, faced a barrage of attacks on social media from the Massachusetts Teachers Association, which is against charter schools because it believes the initiative would take money away from public school funding. Jehlen publicly opposes the ballot initiative, and debated pro-charter school state director of Democrats for Education Reform, Liam Kerr on WGBH Radio.
Jehlen said in the debate that Democrats for Education Reform had spent more than $100,000 in this election to support Cheung, making it one of the most expensive state senate elections this year.
“Who is my real opponent here?” Jehlen asked in the debate. “I think my real opponent is Democrats for Education Reform.”
But local incumbents did not have a clean sweep of their races. Cambridge City Councillor and Democratic State Representative Timothy J. Toomey Jr, who has held his seat in the state Capitol since 1993, was upset in his primary by his opponent Michael Connolly. Connolly—a former candidate for City Council—received the endorsement of a group formerly associated with the Bernie Sanders campaign. Connolly will now run unopposed in November.
Turnout was predicted to be low in Thursday’s primary election for a variety of reasons. There were few high profile races on the ballot, and no federal-level races. The Bay State’s United States Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey are not up for reelection this year. In addition, the nine United States Representatives from Massachusetts, all Democrats, faced no primary challengers. Only four of those Representatives are slated to have Republican challengers in November.
Like their national counterparts, state legislators faced little opposition. In fact, 88.8 percent of all incumbents did not have a challenger in this election. A 40-member body, the Massachusetts State Senate had only seven contested Democratic primaries and two contested Republican primaries on Thursday. Two of three state senators that represent Cambridge, Sal DiDomenico and Joseph Boncore, faced no opposition.
Notable Harvard affiliates with uncontested races included U.S. Representative and Harvard Law School Graduate, Joseph P. Kennedy III, as well as State Senator and former Harvard Democrats President Eric Lesser ’07.

The Harvard Life Lab, a new biotech research and enterprise facility in Allston, has selected 11 young companies to take up residence in advance of its November opening.
The application to work in the space remains open, and the selection committee—composed of Harvard faculty and administrators and biotech entrepreneurs—plans to announce an additional five to eight ventures by mid-October, according to Harvard Innovation Lab Director Jodi Goldstein.
The Life Lab, a 15,000 square-foot biotech facility located next to the i-Lab on Western Avenue, is equipped to support Harvard student, faculty, and alumni ventures across the spectrum of biotechnology and life sciences. Contractors are now working to finish the building’s interior before the teams take up residence later this fall, Goldstein said. 
The Life Lab’s grand opening will take place on Nov. 3, where the space’s major donors will also be announced. Though Goldstein declined to name the donors, she characterized them as “well-known leaders of the Boston business community with deep ties to Harvard.”
The admitted companies focus on a variety of fields and technologies, from blood tests with global health applications to sanitation solutions for the third world to immunotherapies. Goldstein said women founded 45 percent of the ventures. The selection committee evaluates ventures based on “the quality of their application and science, stage of development, potential for impact, and ability to be a strong community member,” according to an emailed statement from Goldstein introducing the admitted teams.
Nix, a company admitted to the Life Lab, develops biometric sensors, primarily for athletes. Meridith L. Unger, Nix’s founder and CEO and a Harvard Business School alumna, said she looks forward to sharing experiences between ventures.
“I hope I can bring a perspective to first-time entrepreneurs that’s helpful as they navigate some of those issues,” Unger said, reflecting on her experience founding several biotech companies. “And I think we can benefit from that too, whether it’s within the Harvard community or open to the larger Allston-Boston community.”
In February, Goldstein said Harvard’s lack of wet lab facilities for student and alumni ventures inhibited life science ventures at the student-oriented i-Lab and the alumni-oriented Launch Lab. The three entrepreneurial centers, founded in the last five years, have been buoyed by Harvard administrators interested in promoting Allston as a center for tech and entrepreneurship.
LabCentral, a large biotech incubator in Kendall Square, will manage the Life Lab’s day-to-day operations, including biosafety, chemical management, and protocol, according to LabCentral President Johannes Fruehauf.
Fruehauf described the Life Lab as “necessarily the first stop in [a biotech startup’s] entrepreneurial journey.”
“I don’t want us to ultimately judge the Life Lab… by the number of companies served. It’s not volume. It’s really about quality,” he said.
As stipulated in plans submitted to the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Life Lab will offer educational programming as part of community benefits to Harvard affiliates and Allston residents. Though the Life Lab’s educational offerings are still in planning stages, Business School Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi said it will follow the i-Lab’s model, featuring workshops, seminars, and speaker series.
“This is so much more than just a workspace. Similar to the way we think about the i-Lab, this is a community,” Goldstein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Historical Commission voted to delay debate on a proposal from real estate firm Equity One to remodel the famed building in Harvard Square that houses the Curious George store.
In a packed City Hall Thursday evening, local residents delayed a vote for more than three hours during the public comment and question period with vigorous defenses of the building’s current state.
The proposal, which would transform the building by adding elevators and two more floors of commercial and office space, is likely to cause the eviction of most tenants including the iconic Curious George Store, Urban Outfitters, and the Harvard Square Business Association—at least during the construction period. Equity One refers to the building as “The Harvard Collection.”
At the hearing, project architect David Chilinski, a member of the Harvard Square Business Association, presented on the history of the building and what he described as the intentions behind Equity One’s proposal.
“We spent some time looking through the materials that the Historical Commission had to understand the evolution of this site over the last 100 years,” Chilinski said, during his defense of the project. “The spirit behind it is a minimalist structure that allows the buildings to retain their identity on the street.”
The Sullivan Chamber in City Hall quickly filled to standing room only, with the majority of individuals at the meeting opposing the Equity One proposal. Adam Hirsch, the owner of the Curious George Store, brought a large stuffed animal of the precocious monkey, who sat in the front row of the chamber. During the presentation, members of the public spoke out of turn and interrupted the proceedings, pausing the meeting.
“It’s really important that we keep this Square’s integrity,” said Caroline H. Mak, a junior at MIT and supporter of the Curious George Store.
The meeting began with a statement by William Brown, an executive vice president of Equity One, who addressed and sought to quell public concern that the buildings will become a mall, rather like other Equity One projects around the country.
“This property was acquired with a full understanding of the significance of the architecture,” Brown said. “This is one asset that doesn’t fit any of our typical portfolio. We are looking to activate the street.”
Speaking to the unique nature of the proposal, Charles Sullivan, executive director of the Cambridge Historical Commission, introduced the history of the site from its beginnings in 1630 to the present day.
Sullivan then reminded the public that the commission cannot make judgements about the interior of the building or its use.
“In general in both historic districts and conservation districts, the jurisdiction of the Commision is limited to the publicly viewable aspects of the building,” Sullivan said. “There’s no way for the Commission to exercise jurisdiction over use.”
Many proposed changes to Harvard Square have been debated by the community in recent weeks, and a unrelated petition was passed throughout the audience by Our Harvard Square, an organization calling for the landmark designation of the Harvard Square Kiosk.
James J. Rafferty, an attorney on behalf of Equity One, said that following the hearing, Equity One would begin a month-long process to petition the City Planning Board. If Equity One’s plans are approved by the Planning Board, construction is slated to begin in 2018, Brown said.
Future Historical Commission debate on the proposal will be scheduled soon.
Also scheduled for public hearing, and approved by the board for five years, was a proposal by Harvard University to “install wireless access points and antennas to enable service” in historic Harvard Yard. The goal of the project is to increase wi-fi access within the Yard by mounting eleven antennas on current “blue-lights.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Berylson Field witnessed déjà vu on Thursday night as Harvard claimed its second double-overtime win in only three games.
A week ago, versus Holy Cross, the Crimson tallied the winning goal in the 98th minute. Yesterday, against University of the Pacific, the hosts notched the victory in the 87th minute thanks to a blazing strike by senior forward and leading goal scorer Marissa Balleza.
In three matches, Harvard has reached overtime each time, earning two wins.
“I don’t think people realise how tiring overtime is,” Balleza said. “It’s whipping our butts into shape, but it really shows how much we want to win and how much effort we put into each game. We’re all dead but somehow we manage to pull through and keep going, so I’m really proud of our team for that.”
The Crimson had several opportunities to avoid extra time in the waning moments of regulation. In the final eight minutes, Harvard earned three penalty corners.
But the hosts could not convert those opportunities into goals. An injury sidelined junior midfielder Ellie Cookson, the regular penalty corner receiver; Duarte replaced her at the top of the circle during the short corners.
“In the last moments of the regular game, it could’ve gone either way,” said coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “Neither of [the teams] could find the back of the net. Pacific is a fantastic team, and they’ve proved that before and showed it today to us. I think we actually did very well against them.”
The first overtime was rife with potential goals for both teams, with multiple fast breaks coming from each. Captain and midfielder/back Kyla Cordrey stepped up into offense, driving the ball down the length of the field only to face resistance from the Tigers’ defense. Neither team managed to score, pushing  the game into double overtime.
However, ten minutes into the second half, Balleza stepped up to win the game. Sophomore forward Kathleen Young earned a penalty, Duarte found Balleza, and the senior fired a shot into the top of the cage, ending the long evening.
“The stroke was no doubt about it going to be a goal,” van her Waarden said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better taken stroke in my life…. It was a showcase of her skills and her determination to lead the forward line.”
With her two goals, Balleza stands seven goals shy of the program record. The senior has recorded 36 finishes in her career and has 14 more games to attempt to leave a historic mark.
“Honestly I try not to think about it too much,” Balleza said. “For me, it kind of gets into my head, and if I think about it, it just screws with me. I just keep trying to focus on the game at hand.”
Early in the game, luck didn’t seem to be swinging the Crimson’s way. The Tigers struck midway through the first half, leaving Harvard trailing 1-0. Pacific’s Rylee Corneau caused a turnover at the top of the circle before firing a shot past junior goalkeeper Olivia Startup.
Despite this setback, the Crimson retaliated in the early minutes of the second period with Balleza striking high into the Tigers’ goal after an assist by sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte. Duarte’s pass from centerfield and Balleza’s run around of the defense resulted in Harvard’s equalizer.
Harvard upped the ante in the second period, firing seven shots to Pacific’s three. Despite multiple attempts by Balleza, junior midfielder Hannah Wellington, and freshman forward Maddie Earle, the score was still firmly 1-1 when the full-time whistle blew. It would take a Balleza strike to break the deadlock.
“I think this [game] was another showcase of us taking another step in the direction we want to go,” van her Waarden said. “Being able to compete with these types of teams and win is the first step.”

A 44th-minute score doomed the Harvard men’s soccer team to its first loss of the season as the Crimson fell to Seattle University, 1-0.
After a scrappy half that saw Harvard struggle to find creative outlets and escape out of its own half, Redhawks junior midfielder Alex Roldan played a ball through the middle of the Crimson backline to set up senior forward Jeff Rose. Several Harvard defenders raised their hands to call for offsides, but the Seattle player beat the trap and slotted the ball past junior netminder Kyle Parks.
Although the Crimson (1-1-1) fought to get back into the game in the second frame, the team ultimately was unable to find the goal to avoid defeat.
“It was a great fight,” Harvard co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu said. “From minute zero to 90...[we] fought to the end. It’s the best thing about our team.”
It was a tale of two stanzas at Jordan Field, as the Redhawks (2-2-0) aggressively pushed the Crimson back within its own half early in the game, controlling possession and not allowing Harvard to get an attack going. After starting both of its games the prior weekend by wreaking havoc on the wings against Villanova and Hofstra, the Crimson got a taste of its own medicine.
While Seattle loomed dangerously on the offensive end to start the game, it took nearly 15 minutes for either earn to get off a shot, when senior midfielder Cameron Rohani’s fired the ball to the bottom left. Parks made a comfortable save, the first of five stops for the Texas native.
Following a yellow card for Harvard sophomore midfielder Cesar Farias–his third of the season–after a studs-up challenge, the Redhawks’ offense began to find its touch, sending four more shots at Parks as well as two dangerous crosses that barely missed their targets in the box. The Crimson, however, was limited to just one shot in the period.
The narrative flipped in the second frame, as Farias immediately fired a header that went wide as well as a powerful shot at Seattle sophomore keeper RJ Noll, part of a four-minute stretch that saw the teams combine for six shots.
“It was very important [to respond],” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “That’s what I expect from my team because we have great mental fortitude and that’s the way we train. Not only do we train on the field stuff but also the mental part of the game. And that’s what you saw during the second half.”
Despite the host’s offense coming to life, the team continued to struggle to finish opportunities, failing to score for the second consecutive game. While d attackers were able to piece together runs and send crosses into the box, the team had difficulties getting on the end of balls.
With plenty of promising attacks, however, Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer believes the program has the ingredients for offensive success.
“We have to keep doing what we’re doing.” Lehrer said. “The guys are good on it, [and] there’s good discipline in training. We’re in a good place.”
Along with the inability to finish attacks, the Crimson’s yellow card woes continued, as Wheeler-Omiunu and junior Christian Sady both picked up bookings while the Redhawks also earned a pair. It was the second game in a row that Harvard had racked up at least three yellow cards, giving it a conference-worst seven cards.
Though the Crimson suffered the its first loss of the campaign, the team looks to regroup quickly as it welcomes another tough opponent in Washington on Sunday. While Harvard failed to earn the victory on Thursday, Lehrer believes the team’s continued hard work and reaction shows promise.
“We fought hard.” Lehrer said. “[Seattle’s] a top team, and we competed and fought. We had a great reaction in the second half to really get after it and get forward as much as we could. We’ll look at it and get things a little tidier. But it was good.”
