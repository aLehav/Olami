After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something about a good lie that you’ve just got to love.
Love like the kind a man has for his friend with a clockwork verbal tick like the staccato snap of a bubble gum snapper. Love like the kind a mother has for her son who’s too old to be feeble-willed and sycophantic and juvenile, but too young to be expected to get it right. Love, which is, at most times, six parts disgust, two parts fear, and two parts devotion. Love like love.
A really, truly insidious lie, a good lie, doesn’t come around that often. And it’s not a slap in the face. It’s more a plasma hot scalpel, which, with some magic, both cuts and cauterizes. A good lie can mold a generation of lying liars, and a good lie of late has done just that.
Charles Taylor in “The Secular Age” wrote that modernity is the condition “where we cannot help but be aware that there are a number of different construals, views which intelligent, reasonably undeluded people, of good will, can and do agree on … naïveté is now unavailable to anyone.” He was right. We don’t have excuses to be ignorant anymore. We’re allowed to not know, but we’re not allowed to say we cannot know, and yet, at the same time, we’re not allowed, ever, to suppose we know it all.
For the most part, this is a great thing. The 1080-point, Lucida Grande banner inscription of our age, and of the millennial generation, says that the rapid increase of information has made us more intelligent, rational, and awesome people. We are probably less violent than we have ever been, and we certainly respect diverse cultures more now than we ever have before.
So we’re not quite as evil as we once were. So what? Is that it? That we’ve transcended some inhumanity, and the resulting gelatinous matter is peachy with a few fungal sites—poverty here and there, hunger here and there, police brutality here and there—that need to be expunged, is that all? That’s not all. We are a little different now in some other ways, but the good lie is that it’s all good.
Conservative pundits and young libertarians routinely pounce on the insistence on political correctness as being the great failing of the millennials. And though they’re not wrong about one of the symptoms, they misunderstand the disease. Political correctness is not exclusively a bad thing. But when it arises not out of a desire to do no harm, and instead because one must both believe that everybody else’s opinions should be respected and simultaneously feel as if one must not take one’s own—or anybody else's—self, art, products, motives, judgments, and actions too seriously, the result is weakness. We’re no longer stupid, but we still get trampled.
Sincerity is a dying disposition. Now, there are no comments without sarcasm, no posts without fearful self-awareness. There is no honesty without insecurity. Satire and derision can be beautiful and biting, but not when they poke sheepishly into everything from the conversation that happens at a McDonalds drive-through to an explanation of a concept in astrophysics to an attempt to earnestly tell somebody about the music that you enjoy.
Millennials shout and whimper and tweet and rail against their generation’s detractors, doggedly defending themselves as a unit, as infantrymen in a brigade that has been scorned by the past, and assailed unfairly by unbelievers and old, deluded fogies whose post-war economies have been eroded down to pixie dust.
Millennials are not unreflective. That’s what their critics get wrong. They are hyper modern. They are so inundated with information, so un-naive, that they’ve become fickle, frenetically sensitive, ultra aware, blank canvas fools.
While writing this piece I vacillated nauseatingly over whether to use the first or second person when referring to millennials. Because I, a fickle lying liar myself, have been conditioned to prefer writing a hollow, self-effacing argument than an honest one, out of the fear that my opinion may not fall in lockstep with the ranks of the unknowing.
This generation doesn’t need a “voice.” It is made up of fragmented half-humans who care more about the abstract other people they do not know, than the fixed realities they experience. It should not believe in generational unity. It does not need another reflection of itself, certainly not in animated or list form. It needs a purpose that goes beyond merely identifying what is wrong with everything in the world and refraining from doing those wrong things.
Today, you can’t love God because God either doesn’t exist or is a soulless algorithm, and because that kind of love has killed a lot of people. You can’t love your country because that leads to jingoism and colonialism, and because that kind of love has killed a lot of people. You can’t love your duties and your abilities, because that forgets the past, Ron Swanson is a fictional character, Ayn Rand is a gorgon, and because that kind of love is killing a lot of people.
What you can love is the good lie. The lie that tells you that somehow what we’re doing now—shackling ourselves to irony, hollowness, and insincerity in lieu of knowing it all—will lead to a different outcome than did the sins of the past.
Good lies are all damned, and they’re damned for good. But you’ve still got to love them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Rolling Stone published a feature on November 19 about a gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity, it created a firestorm, leading to the suspension of fraternities on the Charlottesville, Va., campus and bringing yet more attention to the growing movement to combat sexual assault on college campuses. Now, after the Washington Post has poked numerous holes in Rolling Stone’s story and Rolling Stone has issued an apology for publishing what amounted to an uncorroborated accusation, the story threatens to become a distraction from the very real issue of college sexual assault. Rolling Stone deserves round criticism for its journalistic failings and its perpetuations of myths about sexual assault, but its mistakes must not detract from efforts to reform how universities and students address a sexual assault problem that has rightly reached the forefront of national discourse.
The most egregious of Rolling Stone’s journalistic errors was its failure to confirm the account of the victim, Jackie, with any of her accused assailants or even with her friends. As Erik Wemple points out in the Washington Post, whether these failings resulted from an ill-conceived agreement with Jackie or from incompetence on the part of the publication, they reflect very poorly on Rolling Stone and represent a lack of basic journalistic due diligence. Moreover, given the relative ease with which the Washington Post was able to uncover problems with many key details of the account presented Jackie presented, Rolling Stone should have been able to do far better in its reporting.
Just as misguided as Rolling Stone’s reporting was its attempt at an apology. In that apology’s first iteration, the magazine wrote, “we have come to the conclusion that our trust in her [Jackie] was misplaced,” a sentiment that smacks of victim blaming and deflects from the magazine’s far greater responsibility in allowing the feature’s publication. The apology on Rolling Stone’s website now says that the magazine’s errors were “on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie,” a sentiment it should have expressed from the outset.
All of these bungles underscore the extent to which Rolling Stone’s story and apology threaten to obscure many of the most pressing issues surrounding campus sexual assault. First, by choosing to publish an under-reported account and then to blame the alleged victim rather than accept responsibility for its own foul-ups, Rolling Stone has lent credibility to those who claim that false accusations in cases of rape are particularly common. As Yvonne Abraham in the Boston Globe put it, “the chorus of people who believe women routinely make these things up will grow louder.” This outcome is not only unfortunate, but also factually inaccurate; as Abraham continues, “there are no more fabricated reports of rapes than of other crimes.”
Moreover, in choosing to focus on a sensationalized gang rape, Rolling Stone implicitly ignored other, more prevalent forms of assault. More commonplace accounts of sexual assault deserve just as prominent a place in the national discourse, both for the efficacy of solutions and for ensuring that the issue is understood in all its dimensions.
Ultimately, Rolling Stone’s journalistic failings and the magazines perpetuation of myths about sexual assault must not detract from ongoing attempts to make college campuses safer for all students. Sexual assault remains far too prevalent at universities around the country, and one case of journalistic malfeasance does not make it any less necessary to confront the problem fully and effectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, Rolling Stone published a piece of investigative journalism written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely that explored rape culture at the University of Virginia. The article was particularly noted for its description of the brutal gang rape of “Jackie” by a group of fraternity brothers, and the subsequent appalling dearth of assistance that she received both from her friends and from university administration when she attempted to report the assault. The story garnered widespread attention from major media outlets and other universities. On Friday, however, Rolling Stone issued a statement acknowledging that Jackie’s story has been called into question due to various details uncovered by The Washington Post and other outlets, details that directly contradict her account.
A brief litany of the information that Rolling Stone missed, as outlined by the Post: There was no date function at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity on the weekend in question; the man Jackie claims took her as a date to the event was never a member, nor did any member work with her at the campus pool in the fall of 2012; although her account portrays the rape as an initiation ritual for new members, UVA fraternities only conduct pledging during the spring semester; and even Jackie’s friends who encountered her that night, and who maintain that some form of sexual assault almost definitely took place, say that she was visibly shaken but uninjured and that details of her story have changed in the intervening years.
With all of this information available and easily verifiable, why did this story go to print? The answer is simple: Erdely, the author of the piece, likely earnestly believed that she had uncovered a horrific case of unpunished sexual assault. She found Jackie “credible,” and relied exclusively on her account and those sympathetic to it without any attempt to verify details with the alleged attackers. Zerlina Maxwell, advocate for sexual assault victims, explains in a piece in the Post that this is appropriate because we should automatically believe the stories of victims who come forward. After all, FBI statistics show that only two to eight percent of rape reports turn out to be false, so it seems that we would be on the safe side if we line up behind the victim.
I do not dispute Maxwell’s suggestion that all reports of sexual assault should be treated by university administration as if they were accurate. After all, justice can never be served if a proper and thorough investigation is never conducted. I do not fault Jackie for the inconsistencies in her story either, because it is well-documented by groups such as the American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress that many survivors of sexual assault suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, which can muddle memories of the trauma in question. Like Jackie’s friends, I do not believe that she would have risked putting herself in the national spotlight if something truly awful had not happened to her during her freshman fall. But the attitude that I do find troubling is the one captured perfectly by UVA student Julia Horowitz in an otherwise thoughtful piece for Politico: “Ultimately ... to let fact-checking define the narrative would be a huge mistake.”
Why is it so horrible to want to ascertain the facts of the situation? Is that not the rational first step when investigating any crime? It certainly should have been the first step for Erdely. I understand that it must be infuriating to finally muster the courage to come forward with a tale of sexual assault only to be told that, “We’ll have to verify this.” But it is difficult for me to envision another way to properly adjudicate a case. It is possible to believe a victim’s story and earnestly want to help them secure proper punishment for their aggressors while still ensuring that the story is accurate. Erdely even does this elsewhere in her piece, with the story of another student’s assault that actually made it to a formal hearing. The egregiously light punishment leveled on a student found to have assaulted three women? A one year suspension. UVA clearly has real issues in their conduct of sexual assault proceedings, as they are one of 86 universities currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for possible violations of federal civil rights law (Harvard is another). After all, as Horowitz points out in Politico, why did everyone so easily believe such a horrific story if there were not some basis of truth to it?
That is what makes it all the more unfortunate that Erdely went forward with a factually-flawed account as the centerpiece of her story. Campus rape is a reality. The media frenzy that will accompany Rolling Stone’s apology will only serve to drive survivors of sexual assault deeper into the shadows. An earnest desire to help victims is commendable, but insufficient for effecting change without a solid foundation of fact.

From Drake parodies to Nicki Minaj remixes, one Harvard research assistant is transforming scientific procedures into popular music that reaches high schools throughout New England.
Alia Y. Qatarneh, a research assistant for the Life Sciences Outreach Program at Harvard, was awarded the New England Biolabs Passion in Science Award in honor of her devotion to uniting science and arts in education.
According to the NEB’s website, the award is given to individuals in the categories of inspiration in science, humanitarian duty, environmental stewardship, and arts and creativity. Qatarneh has been recognized in this last category as one of four awardees for 2014 who fulfill one of the core values of the NEB, that “great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world," as stated on its website.
Besides the rap remixes, Qatarneh has also engaged with science in a visual arts context, including designing T-shirts for science-related efforts and causes. She explained that her family background contributed to her interest in linking music and science.
“My father’s an engineer, and my mother went to school for fashion design, so I believe my sister and I got a fantastic split down the middle of the science as well as the art,” Qatarneh said.
Now she is sharing her music through the Harvard Life Sciences Outreach Program, which coordinates the Amgen Biotech Experience Program that offers biology experiments in high school classrooms around New England.
Her most recent parody is “Anaconda Science Remix: Look at the Cuts.” With lyrics such as “Restriction enzymes don't want none unless you got cuts, son,” Qatarneh combines concepts from a lab procedure involving restriction enzymes that cut DNA and sets them to the familiar beat and tune of the original Nicki Minaj song. The result , Qatarneh said, is a “big hit” with both students and teachers among the high schools connected to Outreach.
“Music is incredibly personal, music tells a story, and in science, it’s a means of uncovering that story,” she said.
Tara Bennett, Qatarneh’s supervisor and program manager for Life Sciences Outreach, said she sees a future for the young rapping scientist in incorporating both artistic and scientific pursuits.
“She definitely has this passion for education, so I see her being able to certainly incorporate those [interests],” Bennett said.
Jack Howard, manager of the Biology Teaching Labs who has worked in the teaching labs for 35 years, also praised Qatarneh.
“In all the years and all the people that I’ve worked with, Alia really does stand out,” Howard said. “Whether it’s professors or post-doctoral people or preceptors, she’s just got a real good way of interacting with people.”
While writing and recording the song parodies began as a hobby, Qatarneh said that receiving this award has caused her to consider the bigger potential for her artistic engagement in science education. Even as she continues to have interest in research, she said she believes that her research does not have to be “bench-based” anymore.
“I don’t need to be at the bench in order to make a significant contribution to STEM education,” she said.

A Harvard Law School student was arrested on charges of assaulting a Harvard University Police officer in North Hall on Dec. 2.
Police arrested 28-year-old Matthew J. Diaz after he allegedly punched, kicked, and spat on one of the officers at around 2:30 a.m. in the graduate school dorm, according to the police report. Police alleged Diaz was “highly intoxicated” during the incident.
HUPD officers initially received a report of Diaz sleeping on the floor in North Hall, a converted hotel that serves as a dormitory for Law School students. Police arrived and reportedly attempted to wake him up several times.
Once awake, Diaz was “extremely unsteady on [his] feet” and “very aggressive,” according to the report. The officers walked Diaz to the elevator, but he allegedly refused to enter and then punched the officer in the chest. As the officers placed Diaz under arrest, Diaz reportedly kicked and spat on one of the officers.
Diaz has been charged with Assault and Battery, Assault and Battery With a Dangerous Weapon, and Malicious Destruction of Property.
He was arraigned and released on personal recognizance and awaits another court date in January, according to Cambridge District Court.
Harvard Law School spokespeople declined to comment on the record on the incident.
Diaz did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Sunday and Monday.

Located in a basement covered with Chinese-inspired graffiti art, Harvard Square’s latest restaurant aims to combine an edgy atmosphere with upscale Asian-fusion street food, according to owner Ash Chan.
Offering a diverse small plate menu, Night Market opened Tuesday night in the former home of Tamarind Bay at 75 Winthrop St. The restaurant was inspired by Chan’s desire to create a “comfort Asian food” establishment in greater Boston, he said.
Chan, who is also the proprietor of the Science Center plaza ice cream shop Churn2 and son of University donor and Harvard Square property owner Gerald L. Chan, said that his restaurant wasn’t inspired by any specific type of cuisine.
“[The menu is an] aggregate of a lot of dishes from lots of different restaurants,” Ash Chan said, including Japanese, Vietnamese, and Filipino dishes. The kitchen will be led by Boston chef Jason Tom.
With current options including daikon fries, a Chinese fish fry, and chicken wings, Night Market has “something for everyone,” Chan said, adding that the restaurant is experimenting with a menu that will eventually feature crickets as well as Japanese barbecue.
In addition to food offerings in the eight to twelve dollar range, the establishment also boasts a wine and beer menu that includes many Asian options, as well as tropical slushies with sake. The restaurant is open from 5 to 11 p.m. on weeknights with extended hours until 1 a.m. on weekends, although Chan said that hours may change.
From finding a graffiti artist for the walls to designing the restaurant to fit within a small location, Chan noted that it took approximately a year to prepare the establishment for its public opening on Tuesday.
Though only a handful of customers braved the rain to attend the grand opening, Chan said that the restaurant held several successful unofficial“soft” openings, promoted via Instagram.
“The Instagram generation is our demographic,” Chan said.
Lisa Snelling, a Lexington resident whose husband works in Cambridge, said that the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable.
“We love the small plate tapas approach,” Snelling said. “It does [have] the street food vibe without the scary ‘what am I eating.’”

Physics professor Amir Yacoby was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Nov. 24. The AAAS, which claims to be the world’s largest general scientific society, awards the fellowship for “meritorious efforts to advance science or its applications.”
Yacoby’s research is primarily focused on how particles behave at a nanoscale.
“One of my prime interests is to understand the properties of materials at this very small scale,” he said.
Adding that he hopes to apply his research to quantum mechanics and technology, Yacoby cited an experiment he conducted regarding magnetic resonance imaging. Yacoby and his team were able to detect magnetic fields at a range of nanometers, as opposed to the millimeter range of the MRI machines traditionally found in hospitals.
As for his fellowship, Yacoby said that he was flattered by the honor, and that he plans to continue work on his current projects.
“The nice thing about being an academic is that research directions are driven by your passions,” he said.
He added that he hopes the nomination will increase the visibility of his research.
“Funding agencies are looking to hear from the researchers, ‘What’s the next big thing?’ and where their funding should go,” he said.
Fellows are nominated in the spring of every year. They are then subject to review by what the AAAS calls steering groups. Each steering group reviews only nominees in their own section, which, in Yacoby’s case, was the physics section. Finally, the AAAS Council votes on the final nominees in the fall, and releases its decisions in late November.
Yacoby and 400 other scientists will formally receive the award next February at the annual meeting of the AAAS.

Speaking to a packed Farkas Hall Tuesday evening, Psychology professor Steven Pinker and former executive editor of The New York Times Jill E. Abramson ’76 defended clear, vigorous writing, condemning the “muddy” style of lawyers, bureaucrats, and academics. The event, entitled “Mastering Style: The Learning and Teaching of Writing,” was organized by the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching.
Pinker, known for his work as a psychologist, linguist, and cognitive scientist, called for more clarity and originality in writing and warned against “the curse of knowledge” in academic writing.
“Once you know something, it’s hard to imagine what it’s like for someone else not to know it,” Pinker said. To avoid this and other style shortfalls, he said, writers should adopt the “classical style,” a term coined by Francis-Noel Thomas and Mark Turner to describe prose that aims to be “a window unto the world.”
“The reader and the writer are equals. The goal is to help the reader see objective reality,” he said, emphasizing the importance of clarity in academic writing in particular.
Pinker peppered his lecture with jokes and anecdotes, and at one point instructed the audience to “avoid cliches like the plague,” eliciting hearty laughter.
Despite their different professional backgrounds, Pinker and Abramson offered similar advice. In particular, Abramson stressed the importance of showing, not telling, and describing in vivid detail—qualities she said were embodied in the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald.
“Once movies came into existence, I think writers stopped writing that way,” Abramson said.
In light of her experience as the first female executive editor of The New York Times, Abramson offered a somewhat different appraisal of the current state of writing than Pinker.
“I tend to remain optimistic about the quality of writing and the longevity of good style because  [The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times] are both news reports that prize clarity of writing and elegance of style,” she said.
Afterwards, audience members reported being entertained by the lecture.
Juliana N. Sass ‘17 said she attended the event in search of writing advice. “I wanted to come while I’m writing final papers,” she said.

Hunter King, a postdoctoral fellow in applied mathematics, and Samuel A. Ocko, an associate in applied mathematics and a graduate student in the MIT physics department, discovered the key to ventilation in the mounds of an Indian termite species.
Their research, which was conducted under the supervision of Applied Mathematics professor Lakshminarayan Mahadevan, revealed that the termites’ mounds drive a convection current, which helps the release of stale air from the underground nest to the surface of the mound.
The visible portion of the termite mound sits above the termites’ underground nest and is made up of a network of peripheral buttresses—called flutes—surrounding a central cavity, called the chimney. Tubes facilitating airflow connect the central flutes to the peripheral chimney.
The difference in the rate of heat absorption between the chimney’s tubes and the peripheral flutes is crucial to the functioning of the convection current, Ocko explained.
“During the daytime, the peripheral flutes heat up quickly as their thin skin of clay makes them more exposed to the ambient temperature, while the less exposed chimney stays cool as it’s got a much larger thermal mass,” he said. “During the nighttime the buttresses are cooler than the center because they cool down faster, making the center warmer.”
According to King, the temperature gradient causes a convection current through the loop of tubes.
“The colder air sinks and the hotter air rises, leading to a circular movement of air through the mound both during the day and during the night that allows the gas from below to become released from the mound,” he said.
He added that the discovery debunked two previously formed hypotheses about termite mound ventilation, which pointed to external wind-powered changes in pressure and internal heating in the nest, respectively, as the mechanisms displacing the stale air.
“To test these hypotheses, we placed small probes inside the tubes, which measured the velocity of the air at three centimeters per second and also contained sensors to measure carbon dioxide concentrations,” King said. “The twice-daily shift in velocity and concentrations helped support the idea behind the convection current.”
As he sees it, the biophysical air-flushing mechanism solved one of the most puzzling mysteries about termites.
“We now know that termites build such a massive, empty structure above their underground nest in order to control their local environment,” King said.
Mahadevan explained that the termite mounds exemplify the interdependence of physical and biological systems.
“The organisms live in the environment and change the environment, but it is the environment which in turn changes the organism’s behavior,” he said.
According to Ocko, however, the impact of the discovery could extend beyond physics and biology.
“Now that we know what termite mounds are doing, engineers and architects are thinking of applying these principles of passive climate control to create energy-efficient buildings,” he said.

Over the past week, faculty from the departments of History, Comparative Literature, History of Science, and Slavic Languages and Literatures, from the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies, and from the graduate program in American Studies endorsed the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement urging University administrators to adopt a 12-student cap on sections and lab groups.
The endorsements bring the number of departments and programs that have expressed support for the campaign to 15, all of which are in the humanities and social sciences.
Daniel L. Smail, interim chair of the History Department, said that the motion to endorse the section size cap passed “with great enthusiasm” at last Wednesday’s departmental meeting.
“Everyone is realistic about the fact that there are many demands upon University budgets,” Smail said. “And we are very much hoping that this issue will be put on the front burner in terms of University agenda.”
In the Department of Comparative Literature, endorsement of the campaign received unanimous support from the faculty, according to Comparative Literature professor Karen L. Thornber.
“We really do believe that getting students involved in a deep and meaningful way with the material is essential to…providing them with the sort of transformative educational experience that we want them to have,” Thornber said.
On Tuesday morning, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana convened a town hall meeting for concerned faculty and departments that endorsed the campaign. At least nine departments were represented at the meeting, which Crimson reporters were not permitted to attend.
According to History doctoral candidate Cristina V. Groeger ’08, who organized the campaign, the meeting was “very productive.”
At the meeting, Harris and Khurana said that budget concerns are not a major obstacle to reducing section sizes, Groeger wrote in an email.
Other issues discussed at the meeting include a more centralized mechanism to assign sections to teaching fellows and more flexibility in the number of sections that TFs can lead each semester. The deans indicated that they would like to continue to discuss these items early next spring, according to Groeger.
Thornber, who also attended the meeting, said that faculty members raised concerns about the quality of undergraduate education at the College and the working conditions of graduate students.
“[The two deans] were incredibly responsive to faculty concern,” she said. “They listened very carefully to what we had to say.”
Summer A. Shafer, president of the Graduate Student Council and doctoral candidate in American Studies, said during an interview that smaller sections would help to relieve the burden placed on teaching fellows, who, according to a recent survey by the Graduate Student Council, are overworked.
“There’s a sense of doing more work than we are getting paid to do,” Shafer said, adding that TFs should dedicate seven hours a week to each section but that they work significantly more hours in reality.
Shafer added that smaller sections would also help alleviate the current shortage of teaching opportunities, which has prompted some graduate students to seek teaching opportunities at nearby institutions like MIT.

Harvard Law School affinity groups demanded that the school’s administration “grant exam extensions” and “provide student support” for those who may be suffering emotionally or psychologically from the controversial decisions by Ferguson and Staten Island grand juries in an email to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow and other administrators late Sunday evening.
In addition to considering the trauma of students, the letter called for the Law School itself to support the student protests. “Our peer institutions have made efforts to stand on the right side of history,” the email reads. “We challenge Harvard Law School to be not merely a school of law, but also a school of justice.”
Similar requests have been made at Georgetown Law and Columbia Law School.
In the past few weeks, law students have petitioned President Obama, led protests, hosted vigils, and published an op-ed in The New York Times, according to the letter. The wave of activism was sparked by the decisions of Ferguson and Staten Island grand juries not to indict two police officers in separate cases that led to the deaths of two unarmed black men.
The email drew a flurry of responses from Minow and Associate Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove in the following days.
Before midnight Sunday, Ellen M. Cosgrove provided a detailed list of support systems for students that were dealing with what she called “a challenging moment for many who care deeply about justice and fairness,” in an email to the student body.
In the email, Cosgrove told students that her office was prepared to “support [students’] specific needs during exam period.” Cosgrove also said that the Law School was planning “many opportunities” to examine and better understand the events that took place in Ferguson, Missouri, and noted that Minow has co-authored an op-ed piece for The Boston Globe about the controversial grand jury rulings.
The next day, Minow announced an event, scheduled for Wednesday, “to begin to think together about how we might move forward and contribute to the effort,” in an email to the Law School student body.
“I know this is a busy time of year,” Minow wrote in the email. “But I am convinced that this conversation and the work that flows from it should not wait until we return in January.”
Later Tuesday evening, Cosgrove responded to the leaders of the affinity groups, reiterating the exam deferral policy and announcing that Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree will hold walk-in hours with students on Friday.
While Harvard has not made additional exceptions to its exam deferral policy, students suffering from any trauma can receive support and an exam deferral, according to Law School spokesperson Robb London.
“We already have in place an exam deferral policy that allows for individualized consideration of  a student’s request,” London wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Our staff is available to consider all such requests and, more importantly, to provide students with the support they need.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With demonstrations occurring almost daily on and near Harvard’s campus since controversial grand jury decisions in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana addressed the situation in separate statements this week.
In both cities, grand juries did not indict police officers whose actions led to the deaths of unarmed black men.
“Black lives matter,” Faust wrote in a statement to The Crimson on Tuesday night. “It has taken far too long to make that fundamental truth a living, essential part of the fabric of our society, our government, and our lives. Martin Luther King, Jr. made clear a half century ago why we can’t wait. What was urgent then is imperative now.”
Faust’s words followed a longer statement sent Monday by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. In the statement, Khurana announced that he will, with Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn dela Peña, host an open gathering at 5 p.m. Wednesday in the Parlor Room of Phillips Brooks House in Harvard Yard.
Khurana also cited the College’s diversity, described what he said was Harvard’s unique ability to address issues of social injustice, and encouraged students to be supportive of one another.
“I hope each of you will insist on drawing attention to our failures as a society, and that this insistence will be the result of what you are learning, of mutual education and understanding, and of new reckonings of what it means to live in a community based on the dignity of, and respect for, everyone we encounter. This is what we must strive for,” Khurana wrote.
“Many in our College community are in pain and struggling right now, and no matter our understanding of the issue, we must come together to comfort and support each other,” he added.
While Khurana’s words were disseminated through a community-wide email, Faust’s statement was provided to The Crimson early Tuesday night by her spokesperson, Jeff Neal. The statement was published on Faust’s website later Tuesday night and circulated to Harvard’s 420,000 followers on Twitter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (7-1) finished up a 6-0 start to the season at Lavietes Pavilion Monday night with a 70-56 victory over local rival Boston University (2-6). The Crimson led by just one point at the break but broke the game open with timely shooting late in the contest.
MILLER TIME
To say that the team has missed Laurent Rivard ’14 this year would be an understatement. With the graduation of Harvard’s all-time three-point leader last spring, finding a threat from beyond the arc was a priority for the Crimson coming into this season.
“[After] losing Rivard from our program, people have really looked at our program differently,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
While junior co-captain Siyani Chambers and senior Wesley Saunders both improved their shots over the summer, the return of sophomore sharpshooter Corbin Miller from his two-year mission trip seemed to be perfect timing.
As a freshman, Miller shot 45.6 percent from beyond the arc and began to make a name for himself as a marksman in the Ivy League. Nonetheless, Miller has largely struggled to find his rhythm thus far this season.
“He was telling me he barely [was able] to shoot when he was over in Mexico,” Saunders said. “It’s been crazy what he’s been able to do getting back into the game and his shot still looks pure.”
Coming into Monday night’s contest, Miller had hit four three pointers twice this season, but had begun to find his rhythm amongst a high volume of attempts. After shooting 40 percent from three in the Crimson’s 64-52 win over Vermont, Miller made three of his 13 treys against the Terriers. While the percentage was not desirable from the team’s best three-point shooter, Miller’s self-confidence and increased shot-taking has opened up the floor for Harvard.
“When Corbin hits shots, it really changes our team,” Saunders said. “It’s a big energy boost for us and everyone gets more into the game. Those threes that he hit are big momentum-changers.”
LIVING AT THE LINE
Free throws, free throws, free throws. Every player has heard his or her coach repeat the mantra hundreds of times in practice. No matter what the level of play is, cashing in at the charity stripe is a consistent determinant in the game’s outcome.
On Monday night, Harvard did just that. The Crimson went 23-of-25 from the line, while the Terriers made just 11-of-20 attempts.
“Our ability to make free throws…was tremendous,” Amaker said. “Especially given how poorly we shot the ball.”
In Harvard’s worst games this season, free throws have doomed the squad. The Crimson shot 76.9 percent from the line against Holy Cross in a one-point loss and repeatedly shot itself in the foot versus UMass (57.1 percent) in a two-point win.
For Harvard, whose backcourt is made up of slashers like Saunders, Chambers, and junior wing Agunwa Okolie that love to drive to the basket and initiate contact, consistency from the charity line is demanded. On Monday night, Saunders, Chambers, and Okolie were a combined nine-for-nine from the line, with more than 30 percent of their points coming off of free throws.
TURNING OFFENSE INTO DEFENSE
In its eight games this season, Harvard has allowed only one opponent to score more than 65 points, holding six opponents to below 40 percent shooting. Led by seniors Kenyatta Smith and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, the Crimson ranks 13th in the nation in blocks per game and 22nd in fewest points allowed.
Against Boston University on Monday night, Harvard proved once again why it has one of the most feared defenses in the country. Only two Terriers were able to reach double digits as Harvard suffocated BU in the second half.
“Defensively, we were able to get some stops,” Amaker said. “That allowed us to get the ball down and beat the zone…which led to better offensive production.”
The Crimson forced eight turnovers, allowed only nine second chance points, and held the Terriers to just 38.5 percent shooting from deep. Freshman Andre Chatfield came off the bench to tally two steals and both Smith and Moundou-Missi had two blocks.
“One of the keys was that we were able to stay disciplined on defense,” Amaker said. “We came up with long rebounds and defensive boards and it allowed us to transition.”
Harvard’s 7.5 steals per game and 6.4 blocks per game are the results of a team-wide effort. Although Moundou-Missi and Smith are oft credited with the team’s strong presence inside, Saunders remains an integral part of the squad’s perimeter defense.
Night in and night out, Amaker calls on Saunders to guard the opponent’s best scorer. A tall task for the same man asked to carry the scoring load on the other end.
But Saunders has risen to the challenge thus far. The reigning Ivy League Player of the Year has recorded a steal in every contest this year, including a career-high seven against Vermont. In addition, Saunders by no means scores his points through cherry picking, as he averages nearly six defensive rebounds per game.
On Monday, Saunders was called upon to lock down sophomore Cedric Hankerson, the Terriers’ leading scorer. Hankerson came in averaging 17.8 points per game, but Saunders smothered him, allowing him only three.
“Saunders’ defense on Hankerson was tremendous for us,” Amaker said. “He is a terrific player and arguably their best player. [Saunders] was able to lock in for us there and do a tremendous job as he has always done, which was a big key.”

The Harvard men’s ice hockey team will enter exam week ranked No. 5 in the national polls.
The latest editions of both the USCHO.com and USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine polls, released on Monday, rank the Crimson fifth. Harvard (9-1-2, 5-1-2 ECAC) received six out of 50 first-place votes in the USCHO.com poll and four out of 34 first-place votes in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll.
The Crimson’s ranking in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll is the team’s highest recorded in the U.S. College Hockey Organization's online archive, which dates back to October 1997. After wins over Princeton and No. 15/15 Quinnipiac this weekend, Harvard is off to its fastest start since the 1992-1993 season, when the program went 14-1-1 through Feb. 1.
In each poll, Harvard received more first-place votes than any other squad save No. 1 University of North Dakota. The Crimson maintained all of the first-place votes that it had received last week, when the team vaulted into the national top 10 after wins at then-No. 1 Boston University and then-No. 4 UMass-Lowell, yet did not pick up any more.
The order of the top five is the same in each poll. Harvard trails No. 1 UND, No. 2. BU, No. 3 Minnesota State, and No. 4 Michigan Tech.
Harvard has been perfect so far in nonconference play. A 6-3 win at then-No. 8 Boston College on Nov. 11 was the first of the team’s three victories over Hockey East teams that month.
Only Yale has defeated the Crimson so far this season. The Bulldogs picked up a 2-1 win at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Nov. 15. The teams will next face each other in the Rivalry On Ice game at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10.
After the exam week and holiday recess, the Crimson will return to the ice for an exhibition game against the Russian Red Stars on Dec. 28 before hosting conference rival Rensselaer on Dec. 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most athletes, it’s hard enough to balance academics, in and off season training, and the other commitments that go along with being on a team. But for sophomore two-sport athletes Ian Meyer and Rachel Hampton, their obligations go beyond what is expected of most student-athletes.
Meyer and Hampton are in season year round. In the winter, the pair ski on Harvard’s Nordic team. Off the snow, Meyer rows lightweight crew, and Hampton runs both cross country and spring track.
Coming from a high school that required students to play three seasons of sports, Meyer was used to competing at high levels in multiple sports. Before Harvard, Meyer rowed on two NEIRA champion teams. He was also a five-time all-state skier, winning his team’s MVP award three times and placing third in the New England Regional Championship.
Similarly, Hampton, a Colorado native, had excelled in athletics years before coming to college. She was a national level junior skier and won multiple state championship races for both cross country and track and field. She was voted to all-state and all-conference teams, and was named the San Juan Conference Athlete of the Year for track.
Despite Meyer and Hampton’s numerous accolades in both of their sports, both committed to Harvard for only one sport. Meyer was initially recruited for crew, but walked onto the ski team. Hampton, a Nordic ski recruit, joined the track team her freshman spring.
“When it was time to look at colleges, one of the reasons I wanted to come to Harvard was because the coaches were very flexible and would allow me to do both [sports],” Hampton said. “I didn’t want to give up either one. I love them both, so we made it work.”
At Harvard, Meyer and Hampton have continued to excel in both sports. Both participated in the NCAA regional championships for skiing. Hampton was a top-three Harvard finisher in multiple cross country invitationals this year. In his first crew season, Meyer rowed in the first freshman boat, which came in second at EARC sprints.
At the end of each competition, Meyer and Hampton are already looking forward to the next one.
“Always being in racing season means always having an immediate motivation,” Meyer said. “It’d be really hard to motivate myself spending that much time in the offseason, when the joys of racing [would be] six or more months away.”
Another factor that eases the burden of playing two sports is the nature of the sports in which Meyer and Hampton participate. Rowing, running, and skiing are all aerobic sports, and enable the athletes to come into each new season with only minimal catch-up.
Even so, the aerobic base established in each season cannot completely fill the void of sports-specific training, especially for the technical sport of skiing. Nordic ski coach Chris City has combatted this by giving Meyer and Hampton extra or substitute workouts for the fall and spring seasons.
“We make sure that they have a variety of sports-specific things to do [for both their sports] so that they’re ready to hit their fall sport when they come in, but also to set good foundations for what we need to do in the winter,” City said.
But balancing training and competition over three sports seasons is easy compared to maintaining a place in the team dynamic. The hardest hits come from missing team dinners, weekend get-togethers, and off-season events.
Hampton tackled this challenge by easing into her freshman year and not running cross country in the fall so that she could get to know the ski team better. Come spring, she joined the track team, and easily found a spot in both communities.
“You have to prioritize,” Hampton said. “You have to make the extra time to see the people [on the team that isn’t in season] and keep your place on that team and stay a part of that atmosphere.”
Meyer considers both of his team communities “irreplaceable” aspects of his college life. Switching from the 40-person men’s lightweight crew team to the 15-person coed Nordic ski team provides him with social variety.
“They’re both awesome environments but really different,” Meyer said. “That yin and yang works really well for me in terms of the social world.”
With all the physical, academic, and social challenges that come with playing a varsity college sport, why would anyone choose to play two? For Hampton, this answer is easy.
“I’ve always known that athletics are one of my favorite things in life,” Hampton said. “The sacrifices are worth it to me because I’ve gotten such a community out of it and I’ve gotten such amazing experiences from it. I really love it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People say you can’t judge a book by its cover. The same idea applies to a season.
You can’t judge a team entirely by its record or its titles. Rather, it is important to look more deeply at growth.
In 2014, the Harvard men’s water polo team grew. The Crimson may not have reached the squad’s preseason goals, but the season was a success in the way the team met obstacles every step of the way.
At the beginning of the year, Harvard (22-10, 7-4 CWPA) set out to improve on its 2013 campaign, with the ultimate goal of earning a bid to the NCAA tournament. Though there were some bumps along the way, the 2014 season proved to be an important stepping stone toward improving the team’s ability to compete at the national level.
“We really showed a lot of heart and never quit and always fought till the end,” co-captain Max Murphy said.
Injuries plagued the Crimson all year, forcing younger players to step up into bigger roles and the team to play with fewer players off the bench.
“I was a little disappointed that we couldn’t get healthy,” coach Ted Minnis said. “We were very resilient in the way that we had so many injuries and the guys just kept coming and battling and working really hard.”
With a limited roster, the team struggled to put together two complete halves in several of their losses. Harvard fell in this fashion in its first contest against CWPA rival Brown (27-7, 11-1).
The Crimson held the Bears to a 6-4 lead with a strong defensive first half, but fouls and ejections allowed Brown to expand that lead in the second half for an eventual 13-8 win.
Brown was Harvard’s toughest CWPA opponent of the year, and the only one the team failed to conquer. Harvard faced the Bears on four separate occasions, with the final face off coming at the CWPA Northern Division championship game. The Crimson exhibited improvement, though, as the team lost the first two matchups by five and eight goals, respectively, and the second two games by only one and three goals.
Another CWPA opponent that challenged Harvard was St. Francis, but the third time was the charm for the Crimson. Harvard escaped with a slim 11-10 overtime win over the Terriers in the CWPA Northern Division semifinals.
Despite falling behind early, 5-2, the Crimson surged back to tie the score at nine and force overtime. Freshman Colin Chiapello and sophomore Viktor Wrobel each scored in the extra frame to earn Harvard a spot in the final against Brown.
“We fought our hearts out, and we were able to overcome St. Francis in overtime,” Murphy said. “It was an amazing accomplishment because of how close we had gotten the other times.”
Chiapello made an immediate impact in his rookie season, earning the title of CWPA Northern Division’s Rookie Player of the Year. The Danville, Calif. native had 34 goals on the year, in addition to 33 assists and 40 steals.
Junior Ben Zepfel led the team in scoring, with 92 goals overall. Sophomore Joey Colton led the team in overall points, with 58 goals and 121 assists.
Colton was named the CWPA Northern Division Player of the Year. Zepfel and Colton will be the 2015 co-captains for Harvard.
With major contributions from underclassmen and the loss of only Murphy to graduation, the Crimson hopes to continue to make progress next season as players return from injury.
“This team works so hard and believes in each other and wants to have the will to win, and I think that’s a true strength and test of our character and who we are,” Minnis said. “All of those things put together are what this team is all about.”

In the four years Zack Hodges donned the No. 99 jersey, the Harvard football team lost just four games. The senior defensive end has ended his collegiate career on a similarly high note, earning a Co-Ivy Defensive Player of the Year honor due to his high level of performance throughout the Crimson’s undefeated 2014 season.
This year marks the second straight season Hodges captured the Bushnell Cup, awarded to the Ancient Eight’s most dominant player on either side of the ball.
The senior’s consistent play also earned him multiple awards outside of this Ivy honor, which was conferred in a ceremony at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, N.Y. Hodges has accepted an offer to compete in the Reese’s Senior Bowl and was invited to play in the East-West Shrine Game. In addition, he was selected for multiple preseason lists and All-America teams, including the FCS North All-American First Team.
At Harvard, Hodges holds the school record for career sacks with 27.0, having broken the previous mark in the Crimson’s 24-7 win over Cornell this fall. The senior led the Ivy League for the second straight season with 8.5 sacks.
In his junior year, Hodges ranked fifth in the nation with four forced fumbles and was twice named Ivy League Player of the Week.
In his freshman year, Hodges appeared in nine games, missing one due to a shoulder injury. By the time he was a sophomore, Hodges inhabited a starting role, and his play at defensive end earned him a spot on the All-Ivy First Team.
According to CBSSports.com, Hodges is ranked eighth among outside linebackers—good for 95th overall—in the 2015 NFL draft. The senior defensive end is clearly nowhere near the end of his story.

Students are supposed to be studying, attending review sessions, and finishing papers. But in a world where Netflix is a thing—and at a school where HBO Go is free—now is about when everything can (and, in all likelihood, will) quickly disintegrate into watching period. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t still spend this time learning, in one way or another.
Here is a list of some movies, shows, and videos you should watch during your “occasional” study breaks in the next few days if you A) don’t want to feel too bad about procrastination and B) are trying to gain some knowledge you won’t find by burying your head in a textbook.
The Wire
David Simon’s The Wire (2002-2008), a show centered around policemen and drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, is widely regarded as one of the greatest television shows ever produced. In the wake of the controversial grand jury decisions on the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, this in-depth look at the relationship between the police and citizens of low-income communities could not be more relevant. Available on HBO Go, this show is definitely worth checking out, even if it won’t exactly create a relaxing distraction from studying.
Killer Mike’s Speech on Ferguson
If you don’t have the time to binge-watch five epic seasons of The Wire, spend five minutes watching rapper Killer Mike’s speech to a St. Louis crowd the night of the Ferguson grand jury’s decision. In this video, Mike puts into words the thoughts and emotions of thousands of people throughout the country and follows it up with a high-octane performance off of his new album “Run The Jewels 2.”
Good Will Hunting and/or Stand and Deliver
If you’re having trouble motivating for a math final, put on Good Will Hunting (available on Netflix) to remind you that math can be cool (after all, Matt Damon does it) and that you live in one of the most awesome cities in the world. If that doesn’t get the job done, then watch the 1988 classic Stand and Deliver (available on Amazon Instant), a film in which teacher Jaime Escalante (Edward James Olmos) motivates struggling students at a struggling school to learn calculus. If they could do it, so can you!
Top Five
If you (gasp!) decide to leave Cambridge and head to a movie theater, go see Chris Rock play a struggling comic in his latest film, Top Five. Rock (who also wrote and directed the movie) has been making waves in the last week on his press tour for the film, commenting on issues from Bill Cosby to Ferguson, but Rock is, first and foremost, hilarious. And according to critics, this film is no exception. Rock’s character in Top Five, comedian/actor Andre Allen, repeatedly asks reporters in the movie: “Can we talk about the film?” By seeing Top Five, you’ll be able to do just that.

Good morning Harvard, and happy (?) last day of reading period! We’re sure there’s a lot going on for each of you today, from frantically finishing up (or starting?) all the final papers and projects you have due tonight, to freaking out when you realize that your exams start tomorrow, to the eternal debate about whether or not to do Primal Scream tonight (pro tip: just do it). Last but obviously not least, today also marks the very last edition of Harvard Today for the semester. We’ve had a blast filling you for the past several months, and we hope you aren’t too lost over the next couple weeks without your daily dose of weather information, d-hall menus, campus events, snark, and motivation! From all of us at Flyby, best of luck with all your exams (work that curve), papers, and worst of all, group projects. With that, we’re signing off ‘till January. It’s been real, Harvard!
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today brings a high of 43 and a low of 36, with a 60% chance of rain all day. The rain coat is a must, as well as your most waterproof shoes possible. Or better yet, floaties--the flooding on these Cambridge streets is getting out of hand. Stay dry!
