After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 8, 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi made an unexpected announcement for demonetization. People had about 50 days to turn in their 500 and 1000 rupee notes, representing approximately 86 percent of India’s currency, for new currency notes. Demonetization moved India towards a less cash-intensive society while also temporarily halting the economy.
Why demonetization? One goal was to promote modernization. Modi believed that businesses could become more competitive with electronic payments. Another goal was to keep people safer. Keeping cash in drawers makes homes more attractive targets for robbers. The most important goal, however, was to combat corruption and tax evasion.
90 percent of business transactions were made in cash at the time of the announcement, many of which were in the underground economy. Only 1 percent of the population paid taxes. The sudden demonetization and daily cash change limit of U.S. $60 worth of notes was meant to target criminals with lots of large denomination notes by allowing minimal time to transfer black money into alternative funds. The policy still caused common people to suffer greatly, however; during the 50 day period, many left work to stand in long lines to change out cash. Some even died from shock or suicide when they could not change all of their cash on time.
Was demonetization effective? Only about 1-2 percent of India’s black wealth was in cash before the November announcement. According to Arun Kumar, a Delhi-based economist, criminals and the corrupt find alternative ways to store their wealth. Modi’s goal of targeting corruption and black money was likely not as successful as he would have wished.
India’s move toward less cash has been discussed extensively in the U.S. as well, as it intensifies debates about the feasibility of moving toward a cashless society. A less cash world would reduce the role of the shadow economy, provide more flexibility for monetary policy, and reduce inequality. Scandinavia is already a less cash society success story, boasting one of the lowest rates of corruption and inequality worldwide with only around 5 percent cash in circulation.
In general, more advanced economies are using less paper money, yet the cash in circulation is not decreasing. Most of the total value of all U.S. dollars is stored in $100 bills. For every person in the U.S., there exist 34 $100 bills. Yet most of us hardly handle cash anymore, much less $100 bills. So where are they?
Most are in the global underground economy, which, according to Harvard economics professor Kenneth S. Rogoff, supports a laundry list of crimes, including tax evasion, bribery, terrorism, the drug trade, and human trafficking. Since transporting or hiding a suitcase of $100 bills is easier than doing the same with five suitcases of $20 bills, cash of smaller denominations can hinder underground activity.
Many law enforcement officials and central bankers, including former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75 and former University President and Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, support less cash economies. Replacing large denomination bills with electronic transactions would lead to increased transparency and government monitoring that might prevent black market activities. Though privacy concerns exist, smaller denomination cash notes will still allow for non-electronic transactions. Likewise, though some disapprove of increased government control over money, past decisions don’t necessarily predict the result of future decisions.
Less cash also adds an additional tool to the Fed’s toolbox: negative nominal interest rates. These may be effective for recovery from recessions and financial crises, though it is hard to be sure. 
In India, the economy is recovering from its initial slowdown six months on, though it still has problems. Nevertheless, we cannot assess India’s success from solely short-term observations. It will take time before we can observe long-run effects.  But even when we do have perspective, we must remember that India’s results cannot be directly related to potential effects in the U.S. Significant differences exist between the two countries.
Fear of change may be a significant obstacle in moving toward a less cash society, and in India protests followed Modi’s announcement. But long-term effects may pay off. We should encourage open-minded thinking and approach the implementation of a less cash society gradually, cautiously, and with ample planning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ASTANA, Kazakhstan—This year’s Expo, better known in the United States as the “World's Fair,” stands out among other high profile international events with its highly relevant “Future Energy” theme. The international exhibition held in Astana, Kazakhstan is aimed at encouraging global dialogue on clean, sustainable energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions. The focus is especially timely with the baffling contention surrounding the topic of climate change.
As a native of the host city, I had a unique opportunity to visit Expo 2017 and tour the sprawling exhibition site showcasing each country’s efforts to alleviate climate change.
As I was strolling past the newly built structures, the sleek futurism of which reminded me both of Epcot and a YA dystopia set, the U.S. pavilion caught my eye. Although the irony of the American presence in a global event concerning climate change was not lost on me, I walked in with an open mind, aware of the fact that it had probably been conceived long before President Trump took office.
While most other nations had prepared information stands, interactive games, and device presentations aimed at teaching visitors about their country’s efforts at environmentally conscious development, the U.S. pavilion was instead plastered with stock photos of smiling families and famed landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge.
In the main room of the pavilion, I was greeted with a video presentation that offered just as little substance: few hard facts and an abundance of supercilious phrases cheerfully touting America’s global leadership via pop-culture staple anecdotes about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, all said in a saccharine voice. The environment or climate change were not mentioned at all.
The juxtaposition of the lofty phrases and the actual political reality—a divergence reminiscent of Trump’s vapid grandiosity—left a bitter taste in my mouth. As a country responsible for substantial excess CO2 in the atmosphere, the U.S. should have taken both its role in the Expo and its part in the broad climate change fight more seriously. In the wake of Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the U.S. is now not only removed from leadership in the fight for the environment but also from the right to cheerfully proclaim American dedication to global interests.
Big words and appeals to the Hollywood-like perception of America may have satisfied wide-eyed Expo visitors that were fascinated by the picturesque landmarks and depictions of beautiful and diverse stock models. To me, however, America’s failure to bring something substantial to the conversation—one meant to unite different countries in a common goal and to educate the broader public—left me utterly disappointed. It seems like the most advanced country in the world is planning to fight climate change with patriotic slogans and pretty pictures of the Statue of Liberty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All twelve members of the Harvard Corporation will sit on the committee to replace University President Drew G. Faust in an expansion of the nine-member committee that led Harvard’s last presidential search.
Three members of Harvard’s second-highest governing body, the Board of Overseers, will also be named to the committee, according to William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow. Those members have yet to be chosen.
In the past, only nine people sat on the search committee—six members of the Corporation and three Overseers—but this search will be the first since the Corporation expanded its membership from seven to 13 in 2010. Faust, who will step down in June 2018, also serves on the Corporation, though she will not sit on the committee selecting her successor.
Lee also said that the search committee will launch faculty and student advisory committees. The University convened formal faculty and student advisory panels for the first time during the 2006 presidential search.
“We thought they were enormously helpful in providing advice, collecting information, and helping us reach out to a broad portion of the community,” Lee, who helped lead the last search as an Overseer, said in an interview with The Crimson. “It’s a model that we think worked very well the last time. We intend to do it again this time.”
Harvard will organize the advisory committees over the summer, Lee said, and will begin working with them when the fall semester commences.
The expanded presidential search committee has a number of tasks ahead of it. According to Lee, the committee will solicit suggestions from Harvard affiliates, consult with the two advisory panels, and winnow down the potential list of candidates—then likely hundreds strong—to a shortlist the selection committee will ultimately choose from.
The process will likely unfold over the better part of the next year: Harvard’s previous presidential search, resulting in Faust’s selection, took nearly ten months to compete.
While Lee said the search committee will work “expeditiously,” he emphasized selecting Faust’s successor is a “singularly important” task, and that the search committee will not rush the process.
Lee did not rule out the possibility that the search committee will enlist the aid of an independent executive search firm, noting that the decision would ultimately be made once the search committee was finalized. Historically, Harvard has kept the process in-house.
