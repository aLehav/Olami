After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I never attended a protest growing up in Miami. My parents were thrilled. It’s not like they are against political activism; they just really hate the idea of me being involved in what they perceive as a rowdy mess of rambunctious rebels. After the pandemic began, their fears only worsened as “death by plague” was added to the list of ways I could be offed while protesting. That’s why, when I told my parents I was going to a Black Lives Matter protest within my first month of being here at Harvard, they were shocked.
“You’re going to the riot?!” my father questioned, “You would do that to me?” Yikes. Though I promised to take care of myself and reminded them that the protest really was supposed to be quite small, no amount of assurance was enough. And the truth is, I saw where my family was coming from, or at least part of it. Though their fears were a tad exaggerated (my mother unironically sent a text that read “I hope you live to tell the story”), I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t also concerned about being exposed to the coronavirus.
Still, I knew I had to go. After posting an Instagram story that lamented the persisting inequality in the justice system, staying home was out of the question. I needed to be at the protest in person if my concern was to appear genuine.
At the time, I honestly felt that the only way to prove my dedication to the cause was to show up, banner in hand, and march as part of that powerful crowd. I struggled — like many others on social media — with doubts about the effectiveness of what I was posting. In the face of unrelenting police brutality, my Instagram story just felt woefully inadequate. The popularization of “performative activism”— a highly pejorative term — further caused me to question whether I was doing any good. Or worse, whether I was actually part of the problem. This was never just a protest for me. It was my first real chance to prove that I meant what I said.
And I wasn't just trying to prove that authenticity to myself.
We place people on social media in two categories: those who actually care, and imposters trying to boost their social capital. I refused to be part of that second group, posting a #blackouttuesday post and then doing . . . nothing else. Yeah, “woke.” Rather than feeling grounded in empathy and candor, these posts tend to come off as shallow. Undertones of self-congratulation taint otherwise creative points. And those viewing begin to ask themselves to what extent these sentiments are even real. In a digital world where genuine concern is hard to mark, insincerity reigns supreme.
But what if we saw these posts differently? Instead of belittling that #blackouttuesday post for everything it’s not, let’s appreciate what it is: an act of solidarity. If it’s still seen by others, the intentions behind it wane in importance.
People are aware of shifting tides; when they see an argument repeated to them over and over — the same post again and again — they will begin to consider it. The sheer volume of these messages can influence the zeitgeist. And every post adds to the visibility of a movement. That’s powerful.
How are we to tell who actually means it and who doesn’t? And if someone’s platform is promoting an important cause, why don’t we assume the best intentions?
Turning social media activism into a witch hunt is counterproductive; it only has the effect of lessening the number of voices speaking on an issue. And in our current moment of acute polarization, that’s really bad. We need everyone we can get, doing whatever they’re willing or able to do.
We can no longer afford to base our judgements of sincerity on specific actions we deem authentic or truly committed. Setting these bars not only ostracizes those who mean well, but also fails to take into account the different circumstances of every life. During a pandemic, some people, not least those with dangerous comorbidities, really can’t always risk that which might “legitimize” their tweet. Forcing them to do so only fosters exclusion.
I’m ashamed to admit that my presence at the protest that night wasn’t solely driven by concern. I went to the protest because I didn’t want to appear performative, making the supposedly selfless action into an act of performance anyway. I wanted so deeply to avoid appearing hypocritical that my actions actually became hypocritical.
Given another chance, I’d try to demonstrate the courage this moment demands — not allow myself to be guided by the fear of what others think. I’d go to that protest because Breonna Taylor’s murderers were not charged with her murder. I’d go because we have a system that desperately needs to be reformed. I’d go — not because I posted about it on Instagram — but because these things matter to me, whether others know it or not.
We cannot continue to allow concerns over how our activism is perceived to inform our involvement. And we cannot further repress our outrage for fear of seeming spurious. There are too many for whom the consequences of these trivialities are grave. For those who can demonstrate commitment through physical forms of activism, like me, do. Go out. Contact your representatives. Work within your community. Vote.
But for those who can’t, or can’t all the time, don’t let that preclude you from trying to effectuate change in whichever way you know how. So what if your social media post looks a little performative? Do what you can, however much you can. Something is better than nothing.

On Oct. 4, three scientists met in Great Barrington, Mass. to author a petition proposing a strategy that has been called “focused protection” as a response to COVID-19. These writers were Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Sunetra Gupta at Oxford University, and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford University Medical School. Their declaration calls for those with the lowest risk of death from the virus to go about their lives as they would have prior to the pandemic while keeping the more immunologically vulnerable under continued social distancing — hence the term “focused protection.” The idea behind this strategy rests on herd immunity, which is when a large enough proportion of the population becomes immune to a disease that its transmission becomes unlikely. Immunity without a vaccine, however, requires infection.
Reaching herd immunity would require a significant portion of the population to become infected with the virus. As of Nov. 3, the COVID-19 pandemic has already infected 47 million people and has caused 1.2 million deaths worldwide. This approach would result in millions more needless deaths, with particular concentration in under-resourced communities and among Black and brown people, as has been the case nationally thus far. The human cost of reaching herd immunity before the development of an established and accessible vaccine or treatment makes it an immoral strategy, as it will cause suffering far outweighing any societal benefits.
Beyond the pure immorality of this declaration, its strategy operates on an exceptional amount of assumption and speculation. The concept of “focused protection” relies heavily on the rather arbitrary line that divides high-risk populations from low-risk populations. Taking the explicitly stated metric of age as an example, this means that younger family members, who may be physically attending school, must stay away from their older family members until herd immunity is reached. This measure assumes that 20 percent of Americans who live in multigenerational homes will have the means and the willingness to adhere to these standards.
The strategy also implies that low risk is equivalent to invulnerability. Although a less common occurrence, young people can and already have lost their lives to COVID-19. To dispose of precautions for this population is to offer them as a sacrifice for the sake of opening business and resuming life as normal. This conveniently disregards the immense death and suffering taking place due to the pandemic and provides fertile ground for it to proliferate under the guise of wellness and long-term public health concerns.
In both of these oversights, minority populations carry most of the burden of suffering — Black, brown, and Asian families live in multigenerational homes at higher rates than white populations, while the majority of children and teens who have died from the virus were Black or Hispanic.
Further, age is just one of the risk factors of COVID-19. Vulnerability to this virus is complicated and cannot be simplified into the binary that this strategy proposes. Among the underlying conditions that increase risk as noted by the Center for Disease Control are cancer and heart disease, two conditions that frequently go undiagnosed and can be asymptomatic for long periods of time. Under a focused protection strategy, people who are unaware that they are affected by these conditions will fall squarely outside of the range of prevention measures, leaving them completely open to serious illness. These people cannot become sacrifices in our country’s attempts to sideline the pandemic in favor of short-term economic and sociocultural continuity.
Finally, the reality of the situation is that the very principle of herd immunity Dr. Kulldorff and company are promising is questionable at best. With each passing month, we continue to learn more about this virus and make adjustments based on this new information. Focused protection does not allow for this flexibility, but rather operates on assumed constants — that people who contract the virus become immune and that the immunity is permanent. Without those assumptions, the plan to achieve herd immunity via focused protection collapses. We have already seen that immunity following infection is variable, with many recovered patients showing a significant decrease in immune response as early as a month after initial recovery. We have also seen that it is possible for people to become reinfected following their initial infection. Under these conditions, focused protection may create a perpetual cycle of infection and re-infection that lasts until a reliable vaccine is made widely available.

It is for these reasons that we — along with others signing onto a petition opposing the Great Barrington Declaration — condemn the idea of focused protection as a means to achieve herd immunity. We condemn the needless death and suffering that this strategy would cause, and we condemn this departure from the standard of doing no harm, taught by the Hippocratic Oath, the Belmont Report, and the central tenets of all health professions. The caregivers of our society can and must do better.

What if the world was different? No, really. Lots of people say that, and wish it profoundly, sometimes with the light exasperation of a parent whose child refuses to eat vegetables, or with the more rooted weariness of a person fighting homelessness or racism, and sometimes with several different spirits simultaneously, always rebuking the infuriatingly persistent distance between what is and what should be. I suppose I mean: What if we could move the world along, into that distance and toward better? I will have begun writing this column long before I will know the results of the election, but it occurs to me that a reflection on hope and some justification for it is on the cards.
I wrote some weeks ago about the “Mahabharata” and hypothetical possibility, but the South Asian storytelling consciousness seems to have understood rewriting reality — producing, through literature, alternate universes — on a more meta scale, too. One, for instance, called the Ramayana after its protagonist king Rama and traditionally attributed to Valmiki, is fit to be a universe of its own, brimming with lush details, scaffolded by personal relationships and enmeshed by a system of values. At the end of many versions of the Ramayana, accusations are laid against Rama that his wife Sita might have been unchaste while in captivity against her will, and that he should not have taken her back. Eventually, the accusations lead him to abandon a pregnant Sita in the forest. Bhavabhuti, an 8th century Sanskrit dramatist is disenchanted by this and writes the “Uttararamacharita”: a universe in which Rama eventually welcomes Sita back.
There is no shortage, in South Asian literature, of authors innovating plotlines from the longer epics, but the “Uttararamacharita” is unique in the way it presents its innovation, conscious of the way it separates important figures from the traditional narrative. For instance, the drama opens with Rama and Sita looking together at a gallery of portraits depicting scenes from their life together. I see them in my mind’s eye, walking alongside these masterful paintings, aware and even accepting of how people tell the traditional Ramayana. Operative is the distance, the idea that the characters may point to themselves in the portraits — like sitting in a car on the driveway in the evening and seeing your house lit from the inside. Certain plot elements interrupt their connoisseurship, and Rama and Sita are left to actively generate — paint, even — the rest of their story.
Four of the play’s seven acts take place chiefly in the forest, a space overrun by Rama’s memories of Sita, where Rama voices his agony, confusion, and sorrow over his moral choice. He knows in the drama that he stands at a forked path: at one hand proceeds the traditional narrative, in which he abandons Sita forever, and at the other lies the quiescent possibility that he might reunite with her. Although literary innovation is any author’s way of choosing among the many alternate universes of the Ramayana, Bhavabhuti extends the exercise and imagines what it might be like for Rama himself to see his life and story from the point of view of an alternative.
While Rama is in the forest, brooding over whether he should bring Sita back, Sita is also in the forest where she was abandoned. By some divine spell she is invisible to him, though she hovers around him and even touches him, trying to comfort him, responding to his cries of lament though he cannot hear. At one point, when he loses consciousness under the weight of his memories and her touch revives him, Sita says, “I feel as if the life of the entire universe has returned.” Sita’s touch—to Rama, like “forgiveness incarnate” — washes the current reality in a new light and seeds an imagination of a universe in which Rama might bring her back, the better outcome for Bhavabhuti gradually replacing the others. The “Uttararamacharita,” then, allows Rama to imagine and construct the alternate universe that he chooses, despite the nature of the one he was given. He thinks about what it will be like to live with his wife after twelve years of being away from her, what it will be like to know his children. It is about more than making a “better” choice or distancing yourself from the “bad” ones: It is about imagining, in full form, what an alternative looks like with yourself in it, and believing not that it could exist, but that it already does.
Bhavabhuti’s drama does not efface any of the traditional Ramayana. Rather, it bends space and time, giving us an impression that although the Ramayana has ‘taken place’ many times, it is still unfolding in real time in the “Uttararamacharita,” and so there is no “before” and no “original,” only “other Ramayanas.” So, too, is it an argument for the way the Ramayana and our other cherished narratives need to be told again and again, not necessarily to eventually get them right, but because doing so is a practical expression of hope. In our tiredness, in our frustration with the ever-increasing distance between the way the world is and the way it should be, we must not lose sight of this fact. There may be more to the universe and its story than we know.

Hundreds of millions of Americans have cast ballots across the country, but tonight just one number matters in the race for the White House: 270.
President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are in a battle for roughly nine swing states that could get them above that electoral vote threshold.
Trump stunned the nation in 2016 with wins in the key swing states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Biden is now seeking to pick up votes in those states and others further south.
Here are the live results.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences projects a $111.7 million deficit in fiscal year 2021, according to the Dean’s annual report, presented during a faculty meeting Tuesday.
The projected deficit for fiscal year 2021 — which began July 1 — represents roughly 7 percent of the FAS’s roughly $1.56 billion total budget for 2020. The FAS ended fiscal year 2019 with a $13.6 million surplus.
Still, FAS ended the 2020 fiscal year in a stronger financial position than it had anticipated at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The actual 2020 deficit of $22 million — representing less than 2 percent of FAS’s budget — marks a sharp decrease from the $41.7 million deficit FAS projected in March, when the University moved all instruction online due to the pandemic.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in April that FAS was unable to cover its fiscal year 2020 budget after incurring more than $30 million in unforeseen expenses and lost revenue due to the pandemic.
The University took several cost-saving measures in April, including University-wide salary and hiring freezes, discretionary spending reductions, salary cuts for several administrators, and a voluntary early retirement program for staff. In addition to complying with University-wide policies, FAS suspended its capital projects.
While FAS predicted a revenue loss of $79 million in March due to the coronavirus, as compared to its original budget, the actual revenue loss was only about half that, at $38 million.
The FAS reported a net of $16 million more revenue than expected from donor gifts; roughly $12 million more from sponsored federal and nonfederal funding; and $10 million more from other income, comprising royalties, services, and programs revenues.
On the other hand, expense savings of $21.2 million amounted to only around half of the $41.3 million FAS predicted it would be able to save in March.
While FAS originally predicted it would save $8.5 million in salary, wage, and benefits expenses, these costs instead increased by $0.4 million after the University decided to pay workers through the fiscal year rather than furloughing or laying off employees. The FAS also incurred $15 million in costs from its early retirement program.
The FAS’s 2020 deficit marks a downturn from the surpluses of $13.6 million and $3.1 million it reported in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to 2018, the FAS reported several consecutive years of budget deficits, struggling to recover from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis.
FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 said during the faculty meeting that making up the deficit may require major “structural” changes to the FAS’s finances in the long run.
“We’re not going to be able to close that in one year,” she said. “We may have to get leaner to be more sustainable over the long term.”
Despite shaving off nearly half of the projected 2020 deficit, Kirwan said most of the pandemic’s financial impact will be visible in the 2021 budget.
“That was the easy part,” Kirwan said of the 2020 budget.
The dean’s report also provides updated information about faculty composition and hiring. The total number of ladder faculty rose slightly from 724 to 728 this year, and the percentage of ladder faculty of color rose by 1 percentage point from 2019, to 25 percent. Women now make up 32 percent of the ladder faculty, also up 1 percentage point from last year.
During the 2019-2020 academic year, FAS conducted 63 faculty searches and extended 38 offers. Forty-seven percent of the offers went to women, and 32 percent went to faculty of color, both slight improvements from the previous five year average, according to the report.
Just eight of 15, or 53 percent, of internal tenure reviews were successful in 2019-20 — a significant decrease from a success rate of 69 percent last year and the ten-year rate of 70 percent. The decrease comes during an academic year which saw several controversial tenure denials, such as the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, whose research engages with race and ethnicity.
Half of female faculty who went up for internal promotion in 2019-20 succeeded, compared to 80 percent in 2018-19. This year’s figures were too small to report racial and ethnic data on tenure cases, the report said.
The report notes that in order to increase the number of Black, Hispanic, Native American, and multiracial faculty, the FAS must “work harder to attract the broadest possible tenure-track faculty applicant pools.” While 16.2 percent of domestic Ph.D. recipients identified as members of those groups in 2018, just 6.5 percent of applicants to Harvard’s tenure-track positions between 2013 and 2019 identified in those groups.
Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser said during the meeting that the divergence resulted from the FAS’s current “passive” policy towards recruitment, which she said is sometimes limited to putting up an application and assuming applicants will be attracted by the Harvard name. More proactive outreach will help diversify the applicant pool, Zipser said.
Also during Tuesday’s faculty meeting, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced that University administrators will convene a town hall to discuss the ad hoc committee step of Harvard’s tenure review process. The use of ad hoc committees has been one of the most contentious steps in the process — critics have called them a “black box” that could disadvantage women and faculty of color — but are not being examined during the FAS’s current tenure procedures review because they are under the University's purview.
Garber said he and University President Lawrence S. Bacow hoped a town hall would “demystify” the ad hoc committee and give faculty a “more complete picture” of the process.

Harvard School of Public Health professor Robert J. Blendon and Managing Director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program John M. Benson explored the implications of the 2020 election on U.S. healthcare policy in a study published last week.
In the report, the two experts discussed evaluations of the incumbent president’s performance; Americans’ views on issues such as health care, COVID-19, abortion, gun control, and racism; and implications for future election cycles.
The publication is the latest iteration of a report Blendon has written in The New England Journal of Medicine on the health policy implications of each presidential election for the past twenty years.
“The idea is to give a weather forecast,” Blendon said. “We conduct original polling surveys all throughout the year on health and domestic issues. And then we do a review. We review interviews with about 500,000 people every five years.”
The report focused on trends of bipartisanship and policy disparities between the Democratic and Republican parties.
Blendon and Benson emphasized the importance of considering all three branches of the U.S. government — not just the presidency — when evaluating the implications of the election. The publication detailed how the two parties were likely to prioritize the policy recommendations of major donors and other keen supporters rather than advocate for policies supported by the majority of Americans.
“Because the United States is so divided politically with the exception of a few areas, major policy directions will be influenced heavily by which party gains control of the presidency, the House, and the Senate,” the report’s introduction reads.
According to Blendon, COVID-19 has subsumed many traditional high-priority issues — including health care policy itself — as the most important matter at stake in the election.
“What is really surprising here is that COVID exceeds health care policy,” Blendon said. “If we had talked a year ago, I would tell you that the Medicare for All debate — universal coverage, controlling healthcare and pharmaceutical costs — would be absolutely dominant.”
Blendon added that the heightened importance of COVID-19 may have negative implications for the current president.
“This issue has really hurt the incumbent president. People can’t go back to school, their kids, their jobs, they may lose the restaurant,” he said. “They don’t have an answer for this, but their answer is to expect the leader of the country to figure some way out of this.”
Blendon also said voters are paying attention to race and racism at levels that have not been observed for many decades.
“The second surprise you wouldn’t have predicted a year ago is that concern for race, inequity, and social justice is as high as a voting issue since the 1960s,” he said. “Events have led people to see this as one of the principal threats this country has to deal with.”
With the rise in importance of pressing topics like COVID-19 and racial justice, longstanding debates over issues like climate change have taken a back seat, according to Blendon.
“Climate change does not show up at the top of the chart the way it would have before,” he said. “The answer is because COVID is so personal. The race issue is so much in people's minds now. And the economy has underlying, real problems. It's hard to think about things that far away, into the future — 2050, we're going to have terrible floods and everything else because of the climate.”

United Nations High-Level Commissioner on Health Employment and Economic Growth, women’s rights activist, and Radcliffe fellow Alaa Murabit discussed women’s role in policymaking in an event hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Tuesday.
Claudia Rizzini, the executive director of the Radcliffe Institute’s Fellowship Program, moderated the talk, which covered topics ranging from Murabit’s medical background to the importance of including local communities in policymaking.
The event drew a global audience, including attendees from Australia, China, France, India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Murabit said that her experiences as a doctor helped instill her passion for forging community among individuals with different backgrounds.
The hospital “was where I went and I saw the very best in humanity, you could go into a hospital chapel and people would be praying to different people from different backgrounds, religious not religious, would be praying to a collective God asking, just for the very best,” Murabit said.
She also discussed the role she believes access to health care plays in enhancing civic engagement.
“When people have healthcare they are more likely to participate politically, they’re more likely to participate in our local community,” she said. “They’re actually more likely to even trust their governments because there is that level of civic trust and a sense of reciprocation.”
Following a discussion of her background, Murabit turned to her experience advocating for women’s engagement in policy-making.
In her work as an activist, Murabit has sought to employ religion to prove that women deserve a spot in political discussion.
Murabit said that she often cites an example from the Quran — the Islamic holy book — to argue that Islam delegates “levels of leadership and guidance” to women. Murabit said that in the Quran, teachings from the Prophet Muhammad are often transmitted through female messengers, underscoring women’s importance in policy work.
Murabit said that women can play a “unique” role in assessing community needs during international conflicts.
“When we say ‘unique,’ what we have noticed is that women involved in conflict resolution are a lot more likely to focus on community needs, especially education, healthcare, a lot of what we see as kind of soft power,” she said.
Murabit also advocated for local communities to be involved in “architecting” policies that impact them.
In an interview after the discussion, Murabit used the U.S. as an example of the importance of involving local organizations in policy-making.
“There are incredible local organizations that have been doing the work for decades that, oftentimes, when we talk about a challenge or a crisis — are not at the table,” Murabit said. “And they have the greatest sense of credibility from their own local counterparts within that community.”

United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) coasted past his Republican challenger Tuesday, securing his return to the Senate just over two months after he defeated U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) in a hard-fought primary.
Markey easily beat Republican Kevin O’Connor, a Dover lawyer who backed President Donald J. Trump. The Associated Press projected his victory just after polls closed in Massachusetts at 8 p.m.
“Now is our moment to think big, build big, be big,” Markey said in a livestreamed acceptance speech just after 9:15 p.m. “As individuals, as political leaders, as a nation, we must turn what must be done into what gets done. In 2021, we will put justice on the floor of the United States Senate.”
Markey has garnered significant support from young progressives, who rallied behind him in the primary. He also significantly out-fundraised O’Connor, who was a first-time candidate. The two only debated once.
Markey, who has served in the Senate since 2013, predicted a victory for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “whether it will be later tonight, or in the coming days after every vote has been counted.”
“There is an invisible contract that you sign at birth — a promise: every hour we work means longer days of freedom and security,” Markey said, recycling a line from a signature commercial his campaign produced during the Democratic primary against Kennedy. “But when you break the sacred contract, the people make a revolution. That revolution is happening at the polls today.”
U.S. Representatives Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) and Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.), who represent respective parts of Cambridge in the U.S. House, also both cruised to re-election. Clark, who is running to become the Assistant Speaker of the House, beat Republican challenger Caroline Colarusso, a Stoneham Selectwoman. Pressley did not face a Republican challenger, but handily defeated independent Roy Owens.
“Our campaign, and our movement, has always been about the people. And you have never lost sight of that,” Pressley said in a Zoom speech just after 9 p.m. “In the midst of unprecedented hurt, we have shown unprecedented community, unprecedented love, and unprecedented voter turnout right here in the Massachusetts Seventh, and across America.”
All eight Democrats running to represent parts of Cambridge in the Massachusetts State Legislature were unopposed Tuesday.
Incumbent State Senators Sal N. DiDomenico, Joseph A. Boncore, and Patricia D. Jehlen were all reelected without a challenge. Jehlen fended off a primary challenge in September.
Steven Owens, a longtime Democratic Party organizer who won a three-way primary in September, was elected to replace outgoing State Representative Jonathan Hecht.
“One of the things that I found being a member of the state and local Democrats is, in order to push progressive policies, you can have a progressive party platform, but the party platform isn’t really a living document unless legislators are following it,” Owens said of his decision to run before polls closed Tuesday.
State Representatives David M. Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Mike Connolly, Jay D. Livingstone were all re-elected without competition.
Owens said he doesn’t worry about the one-party rule in Cambridge and that candidates “had a conversation about how the voters wanted the district to be represented in the primary.”
“The old saying is that, yeah, there are two parties in Massachusetts — they’re just both Democrats,” Owens said. “We had a high turnout primary, we had very highly-informed voters, and we had that conversation. Maybe it was a little bit to the left conversation than a general election conversation would have been, but that’s the nature of this district.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 1200 students — roughly 20 percent of the student body — participate in one of Harvard’s 42 varsity teams, the most offered among NCAA Division I colleges.
But that group of students is not a perfect cross-section of the College more broadly — especially when it comes to their hometowns.
To examine the high school background of varsity athletes at Harvard, The Crimson analyzed the composition of students listed on Harvard Athletics Department rosters. The data revealed pockets of the United States which send noticeably higher numbers of athletes to Harvard and consistent trends in the regions — and often, schools — from which certain teams and sports drew athletes.
Harvard athletes’ hometowns were concentrated in the Northeast, with an even greater percentage of the athlete population hailing from the region than the general student population. The data also revealed an underrepresentation of international student-athletes from Asia and Africa, especially in comparison to Europe and Oceania.
Some teams and sports showed tendencies to consistently take in athletes from certain regions, and at times even particular schools. More than half of the athletes who attended high school in the U.S. came from the top 200 counties by median family income. Twelve out of the 19 high schools with more than five alumni who are current Harvard varsity athletes were private schools in the Northeast.
Two of Harvard’s oldest sports — lacrosse and rowing, both established in the 1800s — have disproportionately high representation from Northeastern states as compared to other regions of the country.
Geographic trends among athletes mirrored those in the student body, but were slightly more pronounced. The percentage of athletes from the Northeast was 3 percentage points higher than that of students from the Northeast overall.
International student athletes saw slightly greater representation than international students who were not athletes.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane commented in an emailed statement that the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid does not collect or provide regional data for only athletes.
“Harvard admissions breaks down regional data for [all] applicants, not just athletes. We do not track that information and thus I will not be providing it,” Dane wrote.
One out of every two Harvard athletes who attended high school in the U.S. did so in the Northeast, while only 5.5 percent of U.S. student-athletes graduated high school in the Southeast. Just four out of the eleven states in the Northeast — Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania — accounted for 72 percent of athletes from the region.
Overall, the highest number of student athletes attended high school in California, with 140 students coming from the state. Massachusetts was a close second with 137. Overall, the five states with the most athletes — California and Massachusetts, along with New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut — sent more than half of all athletes who applied from within the U.S.
Kansas, Kentucky, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, and South Dakota did not have any athletes who participated in sports in the past two academic years.
The two counties with the highest overall student athletes were Norfolk and Middlesex County, the two wealthiest in Massachusetts. The two counties in Connecticut that sent the most students were also the two with the highest median household income — Fairfield and Litchfield. More than half of the athletes from each set of counties were rowers, sailors, or on the lacrosse or ice hockey team.
Ninety-seven percent of athletes from California attended high school in a county in the top 50 percent of those in California by median family income.
More than half of athletes who went to high school in the U.S. graduated from one of the 200 counties with the highest median family income in the country. The Crimson’s annual freshman class survey showed that 29.8 percent of surveyed recruited athletes in the class of 2024 reported coming from a family whose annual income topped $250,000.
Fifteen percent of varsity athletes attended a high school outside of the U.S. Students from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia — the three most represented non-U.S. countries — made up 58 percent of all international student athletes.
In comparison to Europe, North America, and Oceania — which represented 88.5% of all international athletes — all other continents were largely underrepresented. Five of the students originally from continents such as Asia and Africa attended high school in the U.S, and are therefore not included as international students.
Only seven international student athletes attended high school in an African country: three from South Africa, three from Egypt on the squash teams, and one from Ethiopia on the women’s cross country team.
In total, there were only five students who went to high school in Asia, representing Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and China.
Men’s soccer, men’s squash, and men’s and women’s track and field attracted the students from the most diverse countries.
Nineteen high schools had more than five alumni as current Harvard varsity athletes. Twelve were private high schools in the Northeast, and six were private schools in California. Eton College in the U.K. was the exception, from which four of five students were heavyweight rowers.
The Noble and Greenough School sent 15 students to Harvard listed on varsity team rosters — all but one played lacrosse, ice hockey, or rowed. St. Paul’s School and Milton Academy boasted the second most graduates on Harvard varsity teams with nine each.
Phillips Exeter Academy had the third most with seven; and Buckingham Browne & Nichols School, Choate Rosemary Hall, and Sacred Heart Schools had the fourth most with six each.
It was not uncommon for athletes from the same high school to compete in the same sport.
Overall, heavyweight rowing, ice hockey, water polo, and football were the sports that most consistently had athletes from the same schools. All recruits from the Groton School and Eton College are on one of Harvard’s four rowing teams.
Many teams had no athletes from certain regions: an ice hockey player, water polo player, or skier from the South was as difficult to come by as a tennis or golf player from the Midwest.
A majority of skiers, sailors, wrestlers, lacrosse players were from the Northeast.
Water polo was overwhelmingly represented by the West, and 80 percent of water polo players were from the state of California. Softball and men’s volleyball were the only other teams that had a majority representation from the West.
The Southeast did not appear to be a popular location for either athletes in general or for any team in particular. Only four teams had a quarter or more of its athletes coming from the Southeast. The Southwest had even less representation — men’s baseball was the only team with more than 10 percent of athletes from the region.
Eleven teams had members representing each of the U.S. regions and international students. Seven teams had no international students altogether.
Men’s squash was the only team to have a majority of international student-athletes. Of the international squash players, a quarter were from the U.K., another quarter from Egypt, and a third from Canada.
Four more teams — women’s squash, men’s heavyweight rowing, men’s tennis, and field hockey — had more than 40 percent representation from abroad. But among all of these international student-athletes, just two — athletes on the women’s squash team from Egypt — were not from Europe, Oceania, or South Africa.
The data analyzed by The Crimson includes the 677 students whose names appeared on Athletics Department rosters published for the 2020-2021 academic year, as well as all non-seniors from the rosters published for the 2019-2020 academic year whose names did not re-appear this year. Numbers may include athletes who quit their respective teams.
To gather data for this article, The Crimson cross-referenced the two years of rosters, which are available on the Athletics Department website. The Crimson adjusted individual data points when other online sources indicated that high school names or hometowns were incorrectly included or omitted on the rosters. Information for freshmen whose names appeared on the roster without hometowns or high schools was found on various recruiting websites.
Students whose names appeared on rosters for multiple teams were counted only once in the total number of students. Students who attended online schools were not included in location data.
When students are referred to as “from” a certain area, this indicates their high school location, rather than hometown, unless explicitly stated.
For the purpose of the article, an international student is defined as one who applied from a high school outside of the U.S., including from U.S. territories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy-five percent of Massachusetts voters voted to adopt a new “right-to-repair” law Tuesday, but roughly 55 percent of voters opposed a law that would implement a ranked-choice voting system in state elections.
The right-to-repair measure will allow vehicle owners to permit independent repair facilities to retrieve mechanical data from vehicles. Those repair shops can then send commands to vehicles for diagnostic testing, maintenance, and repair. Manufacturers of vehicles with telematics systems will now be mandated to install standardized open data platforms on vehicles sold in Massachusetts, starting with the model year 2022.
The law will also require dealers to provide prospective vehicle owners with a notice explaining the new mandates.
Proponents of the measure have argued it will allow drivers more leeway in choosing where get their cars repaired. Representatives from the Massachusetts Right to Repair could not immediately be reached for comment.
Conor Yunits, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data, a group formed in opposition to the ballot question, wrote in an emailed statement that the results of today’s vote “will only grant real time, two-way access” to vehicles and “increase risk.”
The “Yes on 2” campaign conceded after midnight on Wednesday, as voters snubbed a law that would have implemented a ranked-choice voting system for primary and general elections for all statewide offices, state legislative offices, and federal congressional offices beginning in 2022.
The measure boasted several prominent advocates on campus — Government professor Danielle S. Allen and former University President Lawrence H. Summers both served as honorary co-chairs of the “Yes on 2” campaign. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito numbered among the few Massachusetts politicians to oppose the measure, issuing a joint statement last week.
Allen wrote in an emailed statement that she is proud of the “hard-fought” campaign and is hopeful about the future.
“This is just the beginning of a consistent and dedicated effort to innovate for the sake of more responsive, more empowering political institutions that deliver a foundation of flourishing for all,” she wrote.
Of the more than 2.7 million votes reported after midnight Wednesday, Massachusetts residents cast 54 percent in opposition to the measure.
Supporters of the referendum argued it would put “more power in the hands of voters,” while critics called the proposed system “confusing.”
The Associated Press had not yet reported a decisive winner in the ranked choice referendum as of early Wednesday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 6, 2020, 3:15 a.m.
Election Day is over. All the anxiety that came with it is here to stay.
A race that many liberals hoped would end in a Democratic landslide will come down to the wire, as Harvard students — along with the rest of the country — are left in a sleep-deprived state of disarray awaiting a conclusion to a pandemic-stricken election that has broken with tradition at every turn.
The race’s outcome remains a live question — for now. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has insisted he is on track to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold required to win the presidency, is closing in on President Donald J. Trump in Pennsylvania, a state that would deliver him the White House.
After initially trailing on election night in key midwestern swing states, Biden secured critical victories in Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday, leaving him just 6 electoral votes shy of the presidency, according to the Associated Press. The AP called Arizona for Biden, but with more than 7 percent of the vote outstanding in the state as of 3 a.m. Friday, other news organizations have been hesitant to follow.
The nation’s eyes remain fixed on the critical swing states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Nevada, all of which remain too close to call.
Biden gained significant ground in both Pennsylvania and Georgia Thursday, leaving him on the brink of victory. President Trump’s lead in traditionally red Georgia shrunk to a mere sliver by the end of the day, with now less than 2,000 votes shy separating the candidates there. Given the razor-thin margin, the state is unlikely to be called soon.
In Pennsylvania, a state that Trump must win to have a path to 270, Biden is less than 20,000 votes shy of catching Trump, as of 3 a.m. Friday. More results are expected from the state in the early morning hours.
Wins for Biden in Nevada and Arizona would also put him above 27o electoral votes.
In a speech to supporters in Wilmington, Del., during the day on Wednesday, Biden expressed confidence in his standing.
“We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator [Kamala D.] Harris and I will be declared the winners,” he said. “So, I ask everyone to stay calm — all the people to stay calm. The process is working. The count is being completed, and we’ll know very soon.”
President Trump also addressed the nation for the first time since election night on Thursday, delivering a slew of falsehoods in prepared remarks from the White House press briefing room as he claimed without evidence that “they’re trying to steal an election” from him.
“They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t let that happen,” he said.
His campaign has mounted several legal challenges in an attempt to slow down the vote counting. In Pennsylvania, the president’s allies successfully went to court to get observers a closer position to watch ballot counting. Judges in Georgia and Michigan ruled against Trump.
“If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” Trump said at the White House.
In fact, officials are counting legal votes — and Trump’s path to victory appears to be narrowing by the hour.
More than 73 million votes were cast for Biden — the most of any presidential candidate in U.S. history, breaking former President Barack Obama’s 2008 record. Trump trails Biden in the popular vote by more than 4 million votes.
On election night, President Trump slowly but surely racked up a cluster of southern victories in states Democrats hoped were in play, wiping away any chance of a landslide victory for Biden.
For Michael B. Baick ’22, the state of Florida is analogous to “Lucy holding the ball in front of Charlie Brown.”
Baick — along with many Democrats — had hoped Biden would be able to flip Florida, along with a handful of other normally red states near it — such as Texas — that appeared, based on polling averages, to be in play for the Democrats.
Those hopes disintegrated, as much the south trended in the same direction it did in 2016 — for Trump.
Trump held on to Florida, Ohio, and Texas, and he has a steady lead in North Carolina. His advantage in Georgia, which is home to 16 electoral votes, has become razor thin.
“I think the two scenarios of a 2016 repeat and a magical landslide both tugged at my imagination — like they tugged at everyone’s imagination, I think,” Baick said just after 1 a.m. Wednesday. “What we have going forward is taking hours or days to figure it out — that we were warned about, yet I think many of us did not take that possibility as seriously.”
In a rebuke of the democratic process, Trump portrayed himself as the victor after 2 a.m. Wednesday morning, declaring, “We will win this. As far as I’m concerned, we already have won it.”
In fact, the president has not won the election.
“On the one hand, he did exactly what everybody thought he would do. And that is jarring,” Harvard Government professor Ryan D. Enos said of Trump’s remarks. “There’s no doubt that saying things like that is potentially very damaging to the functioning of democracies. And it falls exactly in line with the behavior of autocrats and other people that try to undermine democratic processes, and so it should be jarring.”
But Trump “telegraphed” that he was going to make such claims on Election Night, Enos said, and “it kind of undermines the legitimacy of his claims because everybody knew he was going to say it.”
“In that sense, elected officials in Pennsylvania and Michigan and these other states where they’re counting ballots were prepared for it, and they’ve continued to do their job, to their credit, and have continued to count ballots like they should be,” he said just after 11:30 a.m. Wednesday. “I think what we might see — and we hopefully will see — is that there’s some resiliency to American institutions that allow the Democratic process to unfold as it should, even if the face of a president that’s trying to undermine it.”
Despite Trump’s invocation of the Supreme Court, it may be difficult for the president’s allies to mount a legal challenge that halts all vote-counting, Enos said.
“People are going to attempt to bring this to the courts — there’s no doubt about it,” he said. “If the states are counting votes using rules that they clearly set out beforehand, by their legislature as was clearly written down in the U.S. Constitution, then it’s hard to imagine that the courts would come in and interfere in that in some way — or what the grounds would be for somebody even bringing suit about something like that.
“So far, it’s just not clear — other than just a general sense of being upset — what stands Trump or any of his supporters would have to challenge any of the results in those states,” he added.
For much of Harvard’s majority-liberal student body, the results that did get called Tuesday were crushing.
“I have seen the results so far, and I feel very much like they are a call to action,” Jessica Moore ’21, a Georgia native, said as election night results rolled in just after 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. “They’re very revealing of what our country values. The fact that the race is still close to begin with, I find really upsetting because it means that almost a majority of our country is aligning themselves with racist, white supremecist, misogynistic, anti-LGBTQ values. And that is incredibly upsetting and very disheartening.”
For students, though, school rolls on — at least in theory.
“It feels a bit callous,” Moore said of the prospect of classes reassembling. “I think part of that has to do with the fact that it is a virtual semester as well because we’re not a unified force anymore on campus that can just be on Widener steps protesting or standing in solidarity or whatever students might find themselves activated to do as a result of the elections.”
“As of right now, I really couldn’t care less about what my lectures are on tomorrow,” she added. “And I’m unsure if I’ll attend them.”

To whom it may concern:
I hope you’re staying positive and testing negative.
It’s the middle of the semester, and the mountains upon mountains of Harvard email spam are almost out of control. “When did I subscribe to this email list”, you wonder, “and why can’t I find that email my TF sent this morning?” Not to worry — you may not achieve inbox zero in one night (although this is a great project for long weekends or winter break), but these inbox cleaning tips could make your life way easier this digital semester.
Daily Housekeeping 
Hint: Learn how to snooze.
--> Check your email twice a day (perhaps once in the morning and once in the evening) so that you’re not a slave to your email notifications.
--> If you see an email that you can reply to quickly, send the email immediately instead of putting it off. Signing up for mandatory office hours? Pull out your timetable and fill it out right now. For other emails, aim for a 48-hour response time to prevent build-up. Chances are, you need a break from Zoom anyway...
--> Label and archive emails that you’ll need once you’ve read them.
--> When you schedule a meeting, transfer them to your planner/Gcal ASAP.
--> Snooze emails if you really want meeting reminders. Snoozing = temporarily removing emails from your inbox and scheduling when they will come back in. For instance, if on Monday you schedule a meeting for Friday, click the clock symbol so it resurfaces in your inbox Friday morning! You’re. Welcome.)
--> Use these buttons on the side to speed up this process! (And subscribe to Harvard Today).
Handling Those Dreaded Email Lists 
Three words: Filter, label, and archive. 
--> House lists can be very overwhelming and may not always have relevant information; you can filter them into a separate label.
--> Unsubscribe from lists you don’t ever read emails from so you don’t have to delete things for eternity (and adjust Canvas notifications if you don’t want the daily summaries).
--> Don’t care about who’s selling MCAT textbooks? Couldn’t pay you to comp that org? Delete emails that you have read once and will never look at again.
--> Make labels for each of your courses so you can find the *few* relevant emails!
The Real Marie Kondo-ing (Even More Thorough Cleaning)
The key to inbox zero: Pace yourself, because it can be very time consuming.
--> Keep emails with research or internship opportunities you would consider, OCS emails (if you find them useful) under a label, and archive them away.
--> Keep newsletters, such as the IOP newsletters or Dean Khurana’s communications, separately (under a filter).
--> Mark the most important emails first.
--> To change things up while organizing, you could sort your emails from Oldest to Newest (and deal with those freshman year emails).
--> Delete things you don’t need, which can include those rejection letters which lack constructive feedback (trust me, it’s cathartic).
--> Don’t delete everything, though! Some of those memes you got sent in the middle of the semester will always make you smile when you revisit them.
--> Remember to change your email background (Settings > Themes) to something that makes you happy! It looks great once you have cleared out your inbox, and looking at something fresh can offer you a lot of joy, satisfaction, and motivation.
Don’t let this post stress you out if you have a messy inbox and are thriving with it; go with whatever system helps you find emails and communicate properly. These are just some suggestions to help you out in case you’re interested in cleaning your emails up. While some weeks will be crazy and emails may pile up at times, taking steps to overhaul your organization system in a realistic way will mean that it will never take that long to deal with an overflowing inbox again. Good luck!
Best,
Maya S. Bhagat
