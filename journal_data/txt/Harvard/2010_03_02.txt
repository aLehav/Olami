After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greek mythology tells of King Erysicthon, the ‘Earth-tearer’ who offends Demeter by felling a tree sacred to the goddess. As punishment, Demeter orders Famine to inhabit Erysicthon’s stomach. Cursed with a voracious hunger, the king sells all of his possessions—and his daughter—for food. Eventually, wrought with despair, Erysicthon devours himself.
In Chang-Rae Lee’s “The Surrendered,” such a plight of insatiable need afflicts Hector Brennan and June Singer, war survivors whose lives are unwillingly but unavoidably entwined by the aftermath of the Korean War. Fundamentally a contemporary war novel, “The Surrendered” derives its plot from a scrutiny of the most basic of human experiences—love and conflict. Though beleaguered with a requisite love triangle and sometimes seized by paroxysms of sentiment, the novel is a paradigm of narrative layering—a finely crafted story that revels in stripping away an illusory front of beauty to expose the brutality beneath.
In the 1950s, June is one of many children orphaned by the Korean War. Rescued from certain death by Hector, a soldier with a tormented past, they escape to an orphanage where they meet Sylvie Tanner, a reverend’s wife. For this indigent pair, Sylvie appears to be a pillar of salvation, a testament to love’s resilience in the face of war.
But Sylvie—haunted by the shocking cruelty of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the 1930s—may be the most damaged of all. The daughter of murdered missionaries, Sylvie has devoted her life to altruism. Yet for her beneficiaries, Sylvie’s presence teeters precipitously between providing mercy and causing pain. Her relentless need to numb herself to the vibrancy of life—to escape into the dulling throes of opium—destroys Hector, June, and her husband, who find it impossible to sever their connection to this fading woman and her elusive love.
The novel skips through time and space, forward and backwards from Korea to China to 1980s New York, where June, who has now become a profitable antiques dealer, has stomach cancer—an irony that does not escape the woman who once starved for weeks as a child. Realizing that death draws near, she seeks out Hector to help her track down her estranged son, Nicholas. The difficult journey brings them to Italy, where in a final moment of redemption, Hector and June arrive together at a hallowed church that recalls the ghostly memory of Sylvie’s betrayal.
Lee’s mastery of storytelling lies in portraying the self-destructive natures of these characters without dramatizing their failures. Hector is a self-loathing, libidinous man graced with good looks and good luck; June, a disimpassioned, selfish woman whose adolescent urge to cause trouble transforms into a flinty resolve. They self-medicate with alcohol and analgesics, their compulsion not dissimilar to the reason for Sylvie’s own addiction. Like the ill-fated Erysicthon, they devour themselves, and yet for all their indulgence in masochistic punishment, they cannot wrench free from the consequences of their war-torn pasts. The author of three previous novels centered on the immigrant experience, Lee is still preoccupied with tropes of alienation, estrangement, and a loss of identity. “The Surrendered” simply concerns emigrants of time rather than location.
“Authenticity ultimately lay in the story you could tell, a tale most effective when it was at once fanciful and mundane,” Lee writes. The author manages just this: he manipulates a realism tinged with bouts of fantasy, a world where grime and dirt hug the guts and souls of individuals who would otherwise appear beautifully intact. Hector’s bruises heal within the span of a day, but the wounds beneath lie rank, sore to the touch of Sylvie’s ghost, who—preserved in his nightmares—veils her own ruin: “Sylvie Tanner, looming naked before him, perfectly alive and beautiful, her skin aglow with a pure unrivaled shimmer…would tuck her fingers beneath her fine skin and then, with no effort at all, no pain, peel it off as if it were a full-length glove. She’d do the same with the other arm, and then start in with her torso, pull it down with a terrible measure, down over her breasts, her belly, slowly skinning herself and revealing to him not blood and tissue but the charred ruins of her insides, all blackness and collapse.”
Lee’s hypnotic, poetic writing poses a stark contrast to the horrifying revelations that creep within the plot of “The Surrendered.” His serpentine prose constantly obscures the crime to be committed next, but his treatment of violence is more invested in details than gratuity, so when they occur—abruptly, though not necessarily unpredictably—they serve to emphasize the remote helplessness of the victim. In Manchuria, the Japanese cut off the eyelids of one of Sylvie’s companions in order to force him watch her be raped. Years later, in Korea, Hector is commanded to kill a tortured prisoner of war, but cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. The young bugler, legs broken beneath him, grabs a grenade from Hector’s belt, but allows Hector to flee the area before removing the pin. Lee plays on the dichotomy between the sufferer, deprived even of the right to die, and the voyeur, who is too infatuated with life to euthanize his victim.
“The Surrendered” is, finally, a romance obscured in sorrow—a ballad of Hector and June’s love affairs with life. Both are prone to fighting—Hector with his fists and June with her cold contempt—but they fight hard because of the imminent isolation threatening to consume them whole. They recognize that war has rendered them forever incomplete, lacking any conviction in human solidarity. Hector, musing about the war, sees a couple embracing: “They were both slight of frame and not tall, and if he hadn’t known them he would have mistaken them for youths in thrall of a complicated and passionate first love. Then they were kissing, quite tenderly, and Hector was reminded that while rife disorder ruled this world, there was also human tendency and need (however misguided, however wrong) forever tilting against it. Love was the prime defiance, of course, most every story told of that, though well short of love there was the simple law of association, just nearness and contact.”
For love—even frayed with the passing of time and the burden of human imperfection—never altogether diminishes. Rather, it threads the intertwining fates of those men and women who, by virtue of a mutual history, obligation, or compassion, have surrendered to its unrelenting insatiability.

Ron Rash was born in Chester, South Carolina and grew up in Boiling Springs, North Carolina, and his writing reflects his roots. In “Burning Bright,” Rash pays homage to the land and the people of the Appalachian Mountains in which he was raised.
“Burning Bright” is a collection of short stories which spans roughly 150 years from the closing days of the Civil War to modern times. Although the book tells a variety of stories and hosts a range of narrators, Rash’s stories remain naturally cohesive. The books span a great number of years, but the work remains unified by a strong, organic internal force. Appalachia is one of the most poverty-stricken areas in the United States, and Rash’s work reflects the tenuous relationship that the people of this region have with each other and the land beneath them. The importance of the earth and the communities drives each story together and remains unabated throughout the work.
The presence of this unifying force continually resurfaces throughout “Burning Bright.” In “Dead Confederates,” an aging construction worker struggles to pay the bills for his sick mother’s treatments in the hospital and resorts to robbing the graves of dead Civil War officers in order to make ends meet. In “Lincolnites,” an expectant mother fends for herself on a homestead during the Civil War and is forced to kill and bury a Confederate soldier in order to save herself.
Though not readily apparent, each story is, in some way or another, tied to the earth. The deaths of soldiers and their burial 150 years previous allow a floundering construction worker, through their exhumation, to survive and pay his bills. In “Hard Times” an aging couple deals with the economic hardships of the Great Depression while subsisting off of their farm. Whether providing sustenance or burial space, the earth of Appalachia plays a decisive role in the everyday lives of the people in the region, a role which changes little from the Civil War to the present day.
Even when removed from the Appalachian setting, the conjoining influences of the land and of the shared experiences of characters that have never truly interacted with one another are evident. In “The Corpse Bird,” Boyd Candler, an engineer living in suburbia, mentions that he “had grown up among people who believed the world could reveal all manner of things if you paid attention.” The subtle fluctuations within the earth and within the people in each story reveal some hidden truths about the depth of human emotion, knowledge, and reaction experienced by each narrator. Throughout the course of the collection, it becomes more and more clear that this influence is felt not only in the earth beneath each character’s feet but also in the blood coursing through their veins.
The connection between the brown, Appalachian earth and the people who live in this region is not always immediately evident, but, though disguised, the earth’s magnetism continues to exert itself. In “The Ascent,” a young boy wandering through the woods near his mountain home stumbles upon the scattered remains of a crashed airplane buried in the ground. Inside, he discovers the bodies of two people and removes a wedding ring and a Rolex watch from the corpses. These unearthed items are used by the boy’s parents to buy drugs, illustrating the circuitous ways in which the land exerts itself in the community. More directly, in “Burning Bright,” the short story which serves as the collection’s namesake, a drought prevents farmers from growing or raising any crops as their harvests withers on the dry earth.
As a result of this primitive, organic bond which links each story, the emotions and actions portrayed in the collection are unfettered and, on occasion, brutal. The subject matter of many of the stories is somber, as Rash’s narrators recount situations ranging from an eleven year old with meth-addicted parents in “The Ascent,” to the killing of a dog accused of stealing eggs during the Great Depression in “Hard Times.”
Despite the difficult nature of his material, Rash’s writing remains abrupt and poignant. His prose is condensed and powerful, relaying a host of information and feeling in a limited space. His narrators are varied, ranging from engineers to construction workers, and he showcases his abilities as an author by adeptly assuming new voices every time. The vernacular of each of his characters adds personality to each story, while Rash’s intimate knowledge of the land and the people who live there adds depth and clarity to his work.
Ron Rash succeeds with “Burning Bright” particularly in his effort to weave his experience and knowledge of the Appalachian Mountains and its people into a web of interactions, history, and struggles. It is this central element which allows him to forge a contiguous whole out of dissimilar parts. In a mere 200 pages, Rash is able to capture the raw and luminous lives and personalities of the region’s people.

If it were necessary to succinctly describe the reputability of Kevin Smith’s latest buddy-cop venture “Cop Out,” it would be best to default to a typical line from Tracy Morgan’s character in the movie: “I set records with my shit-turds!”  Unfortunately, “Cop Out” represents a literal cop out by Kevin Smith in the production of a “shit-turd” of a film.
The movie is a striking downturn in Kevin Smith’s now-questionable tenure as a director, a case-in-point of Bruce Willis buttressing the self-fulfilling prophecy of his declining career, and an example of why Tracy Morgan should stay off the silver screen and on cable for everyone’s sake.
Everyone loves a buddy-cop film. Whether it’s Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker together in “Rush Hour” or Martin Lawrence in “Blue Streak,” “National Security,” or “Bad Boys,” the normally-funny dynamics of characters and plot lend themselves to successful films. With hysterical love/hate relationships between the partners, the usually high-paced and unrealistic save-the-world plots, goofy slip-ups, and ass-kicking repartee, the genre has always offered a lot to audiences. But “Cop Out” surely gives the genre a bad rep.
Up until last December, “Cop Out” was originally to be titled “A Couple of Dicks,” which would have been appropriate in its own right. The entire hour and a half movie represents the “dicking around” of Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan in a pointless, time-wasting plot with their accompanying Z-list acting performances.
Throughout the movie, you can tell that even Willis and Morgan know it is a terrible film, with visible sighs and eye rolling by the two that seem to move beyond the script and into their feeling about the film that they’re putting their names on.
Tracy Morgan’s cop character is supposed to be a reputable, well-seasoned officer who has had many decorated years on the force. But his character is so utterly stupid and incompetent that it is quickly obvious that this is impossible, implying either a complete casting failure or an intended joke that simply isn’t funny. His character is given a part that includes some serious emotions, but Morgan is incapable of playing a character with personality traits beyond stupidity and mockingly idiotic sorrow. He is trapped in an idiot box of slapstick comedy that prevents him from playing an actually funny role outside his hilarious “30 Rock” alter-ego, and thus should stick to his day job.
Bruce Willis, on the other hand, should retire. Ninety percent of his roles have been gritty, pissed-off big-city cops, and in a logarithmic fashion, each of his roles have been less and less complex, intriguing, and worth watching. “Cop Out” epitomizes this inconvenient truth. Bruce Willis’s “Die Hard” hero John McClane is still a beloved character, but ever since “Die Hard,” Willis has been shooting for and failing to reach that first high. In “Cop Out,” his utter irrelevamcy as an actor is made explictly clear and he should accept that before he unleashes “Cop Out 2.”
All the blame cannot be put on Willis and Morgan, though. The script, story, and directing are the equivalent of a third-grader’s art project shot with a dad’s camcorder. Kevin Smith, in all ways possible, dropped the ball. The story has absolutely no stakes, no worthwhile subplots, nor any reason for the audience to have a vested interest in what is happening on the screen. Despite its R rating and rampant profanity, “Cop Out” is a PG-13 comedy overdosed on unnecessary sex jokes and crude language. A taint on even as poor a filmography as Kevin Smith’s recent works, “Cop Out” is a cop out by all those associated with its production and should be avoided at all costs.

“The Museum of Eterna’s Novel” by Macedonio Fernández is engaging and hilarious, light-hearted and profound. The one non-contradictory aspect of the work is its overt attempt to win the reader’s time, attention, praise, and awe—a goal at which it succeeds beautifully. As the author himself describes it, “This will be the novel that’s thrown violently to the floor most often, and avidly taken up again just as often. What author can boast of that?” The novel is written in a unique form, consisting of dialogues between the author and his readers, which take place over a series of prologues.
‘The Museum of Eterna’s Novel’ is a meta-novel that goes so deep into the swirl of metas that it loses itself, its characters, and us in the process. And yet it is all about the relationship between reader and author, and what fiction can and cannot do. “The Museum of Eterna’s Novel” is a proverbial Wonderland of wit and explicitly enunciated confusion, where forward leads backwards, and where a word is synonymous with its opposite. As the novel progresses, Fernández constantly shifts voice and tone in a self-conscious attempt to disorient his reader.
Fernández writes in the first of about fifty playful prologues introducing his novel, “Let the Reader take charge of my agitation and trust in my promise of a forthcoming goodbad novel, firstlast in its genre, in which the best of the bad of ‘Adriana Buenos Aires’ and the best of the good of ‘Eterna’s Novel’ will be allied, and in which I will recollect the experience gained in my efforts to convince myself that something good was bad, and vice versa, because I needed it to finish a chapter of one or the other...” He then mentions that he wrote a page of the good novel and a page of the bad novel per day, and sometimes the pages got mixed up. It is now up to the readers, he says, to collaborate and sort out the confusion.
Fernández, born in Buenos Aires in 1874, worked on this novel between 1925 and 1938. A philosopher, humorist, writer and poet, he started “The Museum of Eterna’s Novel” when he was about fifty and rewrote it five times before his death. Fernández was very concerned about writing, but not nearly as concerned about publishing his own work.
Among English speakers he is better known, not as an author, but as a character in the works of Jorge Luis Borges. Fernández was a close friend of the South American literary giant, and Borges cites Fernandez as one of his most important mentors and influences. The two share a desire to discover what actually lies at the core of the accepted concepts of time, structure and pattern, and the less accepted ones of metaphysics and the unconscious mind. Borges draws the analogy that in his conversations with Fernández he was like Plato who listened to and transcribed the ideas of Socrates. The ideas of the latter were later used to form a new Argentinean literary movement. This new translation of “The Museum of Eterna’s Novel” marks the first opportunity for English speakers to read Fernández and encounter one of Latin America’s most influential writers.
The translator, Margaret Schwartz, has preserved Fernández’s subversively humorous tone, evident even in the titles of the prologues, such as, “Prologue to eternity,” “Letter to the critics,” “Prologue for a borrowed character,” “Prologue of authorial despair,” “What do you expect: I must keep prologuing,” and “Prologue that stands on its tiptoes to see how far away the novel begins.” The prologues continue for the first 122 pages, until Fernández includes a blank page with the question “Were those prologues? And is this a novel?” The fine print reads: “This page is for the reader to linger, in his well-deserved and serious indecision, before reading on.” What follows on the next page is not a novel but a love poem. When Fernández finally arrives at his novel, it is surprisingly short and just as self-reflexive, centering on a group of characters who live in a place called La Novela. In a final prologue, Fernández once again defies expectations, providing an open invitation for the reader to rewrite the whole thing.
As he plays with form and layers of meaning, Fernández generates utter chaos within his novel, but it is a kind of creative chaos. “The Museum of Eterna’s Novel” is a dismissal of the novel, but also a dismissal of the notion of being. It leaves things open and unfinished, because the claim that anything can be definite does not seem feasible. Yet at the same time as Fernández  pushes and questions the limits, he shows that there are none. Out of non-sense, sense is born, and out of non-being, eternity.

With films like “Inglorious Basterds” and “The White Ribbon,” the 2009 Cannes Film Festival provided a historical, if anatomical, lesson on human violence. The festival’s Grand Prix winner, “A Prophet,” could perhaps serve as the keynote example for such a lecture.
Directed by Jacques Audiard (“The Beat That My Heart Skipped”), the film follows the six-year sentence of a young, French-Arab man forced to navigate the hierarchy of a jail in present-day France. Though this scenario is seemingly ripe for political commentary, especially given the French government’s recent controversies with Arab immigrants, the only politics present in the film are those of the frightening world of prison. It strays from the spiritualizing of “Shawshank Redemption” while managing to go far beyond the ruthlessness of “Oz,” thus capturing an accurate, typically unseen portrait of a real-life prison.
Because the protagonist, Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), enters the prison at the age of nineteen after dropping out of school at eleven, the film isn’t as much a gangster picture as it is a bildungsroman. He doesn’t just learn how to kill people, or how to build a drug empire from the inside; El Djebena also learns how to read and write. Through his brief encounters on the outside, he also discovers what there is to live for in the real world.
It is often a convention of film for the newly freed inmate to lead a charmed, rags-to-riches life, though in “A Prophet” the story is of leading a charmed life on the inside. What makes this aspect of the film so good is Rahim’s terrified performance in the lead. Though confident, calculating, and ultimately successful, there are very few moments in the film in which the audience truly believes that he knows what he is doing. Perhaps for some intended parity, there is even a literal deer-in-headlights featured in the film. His incredible performance is highlighted by the fact that it is essentially his acting debut—given that his first acting role in 2006 was as a “Taliban Interrogator” in the straight-to-DVD film “The 9/11 Commission Report.”
Audiard is an expert at using this trait of Rahim’s character early in the film to capture the empathy, if not sympathy, of the audience. As El Djebena prepares for his first hit to gain protection from the Corsicans, he sits in front of a mirror trying to teach himself how to hide a razorblade in the side of his mouth, and his gums begin to bleed. The look of agonizing determination in Rahim’s face at this and many moments in the film evoke a documentary authenticity. The typically circuitous plot twists of a crime narrative seem somehow that much more manageable because Rahim appears equally confused by them.
What makes “A Prophet” a truly great film, though, is its irreverence, which often crosses into pure magical realism. Characters and scenes are introduced with bold-lettered captions, and the incredible soundtrack has everything from Bob Dylan-sound-a-likes to Nas. The “Prophet” of the title is also intended literally—El Djebena is haunted by his first hit, a fellow Arab, who gives him visions of the future, teaches him about Islam, and smokes with him through his neck wound. It’s as if Murakami turned the second half of Camus’ “The Stranger” inside-out.
The only complaint that can be made is simply that the film is,  at two and a half hours, too long. At the same time though, nearly every moment is so fascinating and suspenseful that one doesn’t think too much about the time. To the credit of Audiard, it seems as though he truly did need 150 minutes to develop his complex plot and characters. The level of detail in the film almost necessitates a second viewing—if for no other reason than to better appreciate Niels Arestrup’s performance as the Corsican mob boss.
When Rahim’s character goes through lockdown in the prison, he must stick out his tongue to show he isn’t hiding a razorblade, and when he goes through airport security at one point in the film, he instinctively sticks out his tongue—and that level of detail is what makes this movie nearly-perfect. Quentin Tarantino and James Cameron alike should be thankful that “A Prophet” is only competing for Best Foreign at the Oscars.

“The Crazies” is an intense, enjoyable, and surprisingly clever vision of a zombie apocalypse in rural America that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do; raise your blood pressure, clench your teeth, and make you high-five the stranger next to you. Maximizing its low-budget special effects, “The Crazies” successfully remakes the 1973 George A. Romero cult classic of the same name by stringing together a series of frightening and gory situations while simultaneously—and unexpectedly—presenting uncommonly deep themes for the genre.
What happens when a U.S. military plane carrying a chemical weapon (codenamed “Trixie”), meant to “destabilize a population,” crashes, and accidently releases the weapon into the water supply of the pleasant, unassuming town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa? Turns out people go a little crazy.
By providing the rare gift of a compelling back-story, “The Crazies” allows the audience to understand why Iowans are becoming insanely violent zombies (for the record, the infected are not technically zombies, but ultimately there’s no difference). Too often screenwriters and directors are given free passes to avoid presenting any exposition, but here, director Breck Eisner (whose last wide-release was box-office bomb “Sahara”) treats the audience to a story with such plausibility and intelligence that it evokes a very realistic fear. The film is also co-written and produced by Romero, the godfather of zombie movies (“Night of the Living Dead,” “Dawn of the Dead,” “Day of the Dead”) who lends a guiding hand in reimagining his most underrated film.
After a simple incident of crowd interference in a baseball game, Ogden Marsh is stripped of any peace or tranquility. When the town drunk stumbles onto the baseball field carrying his shotgun, Sherriff David Dutton, played by the first-rate Timothy Olyphant (known best as the porn producer in “The Girl Next Door” and the cyber-terrorist in “Live Free or Die Hard”) confronts and eventually guns down the inexplicably aggressive drunk, as the entire town attentively stares through the baseball diamond’s chain link fence. The scene juxtaposes the previously calm state of the town with its nightmarish future. As the chemical spreads through the water supply, Sherriff Dutton, accompanied by his pregnant wife, Dr. Judy Dutten (Rhada Mitchell) and Deputy Sherriff Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) must find a way to survive.
Ogden Marsh is immediately and unknowingly placed under quarantine by the military in order to prevent a global pandemic. Dutten and his crew must not only avoid raging zombies but trigger-happy, flame-throwing, gas-masked soldiers. Olyphant is no newcomer to the big screen, but his acting ability and future prospects should not be questioned; his performance in the film is capped off by a memorable one-liner that is sure to have audiences cheering.
As the film progresses, paranoia begins to influence the actions of the protagonists, as the fear of infection erodes their trust for one another, ultimately testing the strength of Dutten’s relationship with his best friend and his wife.  The couple have little romantic chemistry, but Dutten and Clank’s unique working relationship provides a depth of personal character development rarely found in action movies, let alone zombie flicks. The mounting lack of trust between the characters progresses in epic fashion with the actors perfectly executing their unexpectedly complex roles.
Trust of the government, trust of friends and family, and trust of oneself are questioned as infection spreads and eventually manifests itself in both the physical and psychological states of the characters. Though the film is not without its plot twists and necessary in-your-face gore, it improves upon typical genre fare by creatively turning everyday situations into brutal nightmares; no viewer will ever, ever go through a carwash again without checking for crazies. One thing is for sure: “The Crazies” will please and scare both newcomers and the zombie-genre faithful.

John Henry F. Hinkel ’12 recently co-directed his first feature film, “The Death of Richard Young,” with scriptwriter Kieran Scarlett. Hinkel and Scarlett, who have known each other for five years, began the project together in December 2007. The production attempts to provide an honest depiction of a family coping with a traumatic experience. After being diagnosed with testicular cancer, the father—Richard Young—begins to question his past and present interactions with his family. Both comedy and serious revelation ensue. “Death” premieres March 6 at the Brattle Theatre.
The Harvard Crimson: Who is Richard Young?
John Henry F. Hinkel: The story is about a father of three, Richard Young, who gets diagnosed with testicular cancer. The film takes place in the week leading up to his surgery. It follows his attempts—and failures—to repair the relationships with his kids and wife, who basically think he’s a dick. The film is a comedy though, and there aren’t necessarily a lot of films that take cancer and comedy and put them together.
THC: Was the film a purposeful attempt to portray cancer in a less serious manner?
JHFH: Kieran and I both thought that a lot of cancer films are a little too melodramatic and aren’t necessarily realistic in their portrayal. So, with “The Death of Richard Young,” we really tried to take this idea and move it in a direction where the misfortune doesn’t weigh down upon everything else. As well, Kieran has had some personal experience with cancer and so the story line certainly takes into account his perspective on the issue.
THC: Would you say that the plot of this film is secondary to the character development?
JHFH: Sure, I think it’s definitely a character piece. It’s a portrait of a family during a time of crisis. The story is more about the family than about the cancer. We delve into the nuances of their lives. They all have their own personal battles, but at the end of the day they’re a family and they come together.
THC: What was the budget of this film?
JHFH: Kieran had the Panasonic HVX camera that we used, and most of the light and sound equipment we got from Georgia State University for free. We were lucky enough to find both professional and nonprofessional actors who were willing to work for free. For one of the scenes we had to have food for the whole family, but we didn’t have enough money to go out and buy a five-person meal. So we went and bought five frozen TV dinners, and we were on such a tight schedule that we didn’t have enough time to heat them. So, we just put them on the plates. They did eventually start to melt. One of the actors took one for the team and actually ate some of the lukewarm food. But if you watch the scene closely enough, you’ll see that none of the characters really eat. They’ll just kind of get a bite of food on their fork, talk, and hold it in the air.
THC: What would you like the audience to take away from the film?
JHFH: No family is perfect, but you can work with your dysfunctions and still have a strong relationship. He tries to make things perfect with his family before he goes under the knife. Despite perfection being largely unachievable, he really starts to open up to his kids and treat them with respect. But I don’t want to make it seem like the cliché of ‘I’m dying and must therefore come to terms with things in my life.’ He’s not going to die. Nevertheless, cancer definitely causes one to question his or her place in the world. At the end of the day, it’s not that he fixes everything, and all is perfect. I don’t know; maybe he fixes nothing.
THC: So Richard Young doesn’t actually die?
JHFH: Well, in the original script Richard Young does die. I don’t want to say that it’s all one big metaphor, but it is sort of metaphorical. There’s a Richard Young at the beginning of the film and a Richard Young at the end of the film, and the two are not the same.
THC: Is this something you’re interested in continuing? What’s your future in film-making?
JHFH: I definitely want to keep directing and working in film. Kieran and I have tossed a few scripts back and forth. But my two main projects are a horror film that actually takes place at Harvard and a Boston kidnapping thriller. I naturally gravitate towards bittersweet comedy, but I’d like to try my hand in some straight drama and straight horror. I’m interested in expanding my horizons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What does a producer do? My answer: Everything,” said Mynette A. Louie ’97, the producer of the award-winning film “Children of Invention,” at a dinner event on February 25 in the Dunster Junior Common Room. The event was the first in a new series designed to expose Harvard students to alumni who have gone on to become successful in the arts.
“This is a student outreach initiative designed to convince you all that…the best thing to do is explore diverse disciplines and study what you really love,” said Diana Sorensen, Harvard’s Dean of Arts and Humanities. “We want to show you examples of people who followed their interests and have gone on to have interesting and successful lives.”
Louie makes for a particularly inspiring example. She poked fun at her strict background, explaining that she started in the Social Sciences track as an Economics concentrator because both she and her parents thought it was a very “practical” thing to do.
“It’s hard to be an artist,” Louie said, telling the audience that her father was a painter so she had plenty of exposure to the artistic lifestyle. Unhappy with Economics, however, she switched over to the Humanities track and became an East Asian Languages and Civilizations concentrator with a focus on Chinese film and literature. She enjoyed her new concentration much more, and as a consequence, also performed very well academically. “It taught me to think critically, articulate, and analyze a text,” Louie said.
After graduation, Louie worked in marketing at “Time Magazine,” in Internet development at a consulting firm, and in the business department of “Sports Illustrated Online,” among other jobs. When asked about whether she found all of her experience useful, she explained that she found them all instrumental in giving her skills and abilities to become a successful producer.
In between courses, Louie spoke to the audience members about being a producer and her experiences in film. “Film is so complicated… it’s hard to know what to do,” said Louie about getting into film. She had an interest in film and the arts from childhood and even directed a play involving Georgia S. Lee ’98 (later director of the film “Red Doors”) during her time at Harvard, but took no courses focusing specifically on film. While in New York City, she applied to be a production assistant on an NYU student film, got the job, and ended up loving the world of producing.
According to Louie, the most important part of her job as producer is finding funding for the numerous independent films that she works on. It takes a great deal of work, she says, as she described the role of social networking in her life as a producer. “I’ve negotiated deals half-drunk at parties,” she told students. Despite the seeming glamour of her job, however, it is a difficult and exhausting one. “I send over 300 emails a day, at least,” she said. It also doesn’t easily pay the bills—Louie says that when producing an independent film, one must take on commercials and other potentially less desirable jobs to remain financially solvent.
Because of the intense personal investment involved in producing, Louie picks and chooses the films that she works on carefully. “It’s so hard—if you’re not proud of the end result, you feel like it’s not worth it.”
She also added, humorously, “I have to fall in love with the story and the director has to be sane.” This is why the success of “Children of Invention” has meant so much to her; she truly loves the movie. The film’s success, however, may have pigeonholed Louie, given that it focuses on an Asian-American family.
“People tend to approach me with Asian-America scripts now,” she said, but she refuses to be boxed into producing a specific kind of film. Currently, she is working in the post-production stage on an untitled film focusing on the earthquake in Haiti and is also starting to work on a film that may serve as a prequel to “Children of Invention.”

March 5-12
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Natalie S. Feldman ’12
Produced by Ryan J. Smillie ’12
College students certainly understand the inevitable struggle that comes from trying to appease familial demands while following the path of self-exploration. The upcoming production of “Five Finger Exercise” in the Loeb Experimental Theater will bring to the table the classic issues of discovering oneself, but with an unexpected spotlight on the repercussions of those focused energies. This Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production takes a deeper look at the harm done to loved ones when people focus solely on themselves.
“Five Finger Exercise” tells the story of the dysfunctional Harrington family, thrown off balance when Walter, a young German tutor, comes to live with them. After the family members attempt to manipulate the young boy for their own gain, the household begins to deteriorate and the characters realize that they do not understand each other or themselves.
“The whole family is a big power struggle, people using each other to get what they want and not really noticing the needs of everyone else,” producer Ryan J. Smillie ’12 says.
Both the director, Natalie S. Feldman ’12, and Smillie agree that Clive, the son who is desperately trying to discover his own self amidst his family’s turmoil, is likely the most relatable character for students. “It’s very easy to dismiss people because they’re different or because you can’t understand them,” Stewart N. Kramer ’12, who plays Clive, says. “I think this play encourages us to step back from our judgments and try to understand people who see the world in a different light, even though it is difficult.”
This production will also be making some adaptations to the set design from the original script, presenting the play on a tiered set to emphasize the familial divisions that define the show’s central conflict. The audience will be seated on three sides of the stage, creating a more intimate setting. “I really want it to feel very immediate to people because these are very immediate and personal issues,” Feldman says.
“The play ends on a very unresolved note,” Feldman adds. “I want the audience to leave the theater asking themselves how did this family get there, how am I like them, what am I doing to the people around me, and can I change that?”

The Lowell House Opera (LHO) production of “Tosca,” stage directed by Michael A. Yashinsky ’11, with music direction by Channing Yu ’93, sets Giacomo Puccini’s famously bloody tragedy in Fascist Rome—a good choice, since the political connotations are undoubtedly clearer to contemporary audiences than those of Napoleonic Rome, its original setting.
The visual cues are as loud as the singing: from the very beginning, the slogan “Fascismo È Libertà” is projected brightly onto an angularly imperious archway. The villain Scarpia (Greg Cass) is dressed as a blackshirt, with oily hair and a thin mustache suggestive of Hitler. By the end, when Tosca not only takes the traditional suicidal plunge, but tears down a banner with the motto “Viva La Morte” with her, there can be no mistake: we are in Fascist times. Only Mussolini posters could have made the point more clearly in this production, which runs through March 6.
But the slight overemphasis on the setting can be forgiven in an opera where oftentimes the stakes are unclear or hard to sympathize with. The moral gravity of life under a totalitarian régime refashions Floria Tosca (Michelle Trainor) as a heroine of freedom in the face of oppression, rather than the intemperate diva she is frequently made out to be in other productions. Scarpia is no longer merely cruel; he is now a Fascist and a racist, and therefore triply loathsome.
The painter Cavaradossi (Jeffrey M. Hartman), Tosca’s lover, is not just painting a Madonna; he is painting a mural of an ostensibly Futurist Madonna. Thus, added to the crime of aiding an escaped political prisoner is the implicit charge of “subversive art” (despite the fact that the Futurists tried so hard to ingratiate themselves with the Fascists).
Yashinsky’s setting recasts an opera about the heat of personal passion within the narrative mold of the resistance against totalitarianism, so what normally seems like petty caprice or wanton vindictiveness is instead inscribed with the utmost seriousness. Under Fascism, nothing seems like melodrama. This cast, most of whom are unaffiliated with Harvard, commands a presence in the Lowell Dining Hall that emphasizes this gravity.
Whether LHO’s anti-Fascist Tosca is any more moving or convincing than the one driven by love alone is an odd and ultimately speculative judgment to make, like parsing the merits of a “Turandot” set during the Cultural Revolution, or a “La Bohème” in Vichy Paris. But LHO’s reinterpretation of this particular opera in the context of totalitarianism does bring out an aspect of the work that a production more focused on the stormy individualism of Tosca and Scarpia often overlooks: the notion of freedom as something that lies at the edge of art.
Cavaradossi, of course, is an artist. So is Tosca: as a celebrated singer, she premieres a cantata on the same night that Scarpia arrests Cavaradossi. Subtler, though, is the way in which Cass’s Scarpia is framed as a sort of artist. Scarpia has an extensive, obsessive conception of the way he wants the world to be, and the elaborate, not entirely rational course of events he plans in order to force himself on Tosca is far more sophisticated than the artistry of either Cavaradossi or Tosca.
After initially tricking Tosca into believing that Cavaradossi has been unfaithful, Scarpia exults, “Ho accetto l’effetto!” (I’ve achieved the effect!), borrowing the language of Cavaradossi’s work to describe his plotting as a representation of some inner vision. Scarpia’s plan almost works, but, famously, it is derailed when Tosca stabs him after pretending to acquiesce to his advances. Tosca only does so, however, after forcing Scarpia to provide for Cavaradossi’s release and their escape together, planning a future where the two of them have reached safety.
Her plan is then undone by Scarpia’s treachery: what Scarpia had assured her would be a mock execution proves to be all too real, resulting in Cavaradossi’s death by firing squad. Officers (in this production, blackshirts) come to arrest Tosca, but she kills herself before she can be taken—dragging the Fascist banner down with her.
In Puccini’s estimation, no artistic vision can ever be fully realized. A Scarpia or a Tosca can make extensive plans to persuade, trick, or force others to comply with their designs, but conflicting agendas always prevent their realization.
The human will is messy, and inevitably collides into those around it. Try as one might to make people do what one wants, there is always some unpredictable element on the margin that can overturn it all. In setting “Tosca” in the middle of a totalitarian régime, LHO’s production suggests that the potential for chaos that lies at the outer rim of any agenda is the essence of freedom itself—that, whether in victory or tragedy, we live most fully where the plans of others fail. The stakes are high, as they must be.

Quick Flix, the DVD rental place on Bow Street, is going out of business. Any grief I may have felt for this Harvard Square institution was assuaged by their clearance sale, where all DVDs were sold for five dollars. By the time I got to the store, most of the high-end Criterion Collection DVDs had been snatched, and the quality offerings of the drama, action and comedy sections had been picked over pretty thoroughly. Yet one wall (or, more accurately, one corner), had been left more or less untouched: the documentary section.
To be fair, this may have been related to the store’s long-standing policy of allowing anyone who rented a movie, fiction or nonfiction, to take out a documentary for free. When I asked the cashier about the policy last year, he explained that “people definitely have an interest in seeing documentaries, but not so much that they want to pay for it.” While this may well have resulted in the enlightenment of Cambridge’s unwashed masses on topics spanning from Spinal Tap to sharks, it also reinforced the perception of documentaries as cinematic Brussels sprouts—good for you, perhaps, but not interesting enough for a four-dollar rental, and certainly not worth five dollars to own. (I’ll admit that this was my thought process, and all fourteen of the movies I left with were fiction films.)
This is a shame, because the awards-season reflection on the past year’s film offerings reveals a crop of documentaries that are entertaining, informative, and of the highest quality, including “The Cove,” “The September Issue” and “The Art of the Steal,” the latter of which opened in limited release on Friday and addresses the dispute over the control of a massive collection of early twentieth-century art. A press release for “The Art of the Steal” claims that the film “plays like a thrilling whodunit,” evoking reviews of “The Cove,” which generally expressed an excessive amount of surprise that the film was actually compelling.
“The Cove,” works because it adopts the narrative conventions of a fiction film, and despite the presence of interviews and archival footage, its goal is fundamentally the same as that of any Hollywood thriller: to tell a suspenseful story. Although “The Cove” is technically an exposé, focusing on the inhumane capture and slaughter of dolphins in Taiji, Japan, it uses the methods of fiction storytelling to narrate the filmmakers’ investigation into these abuses. It’s when nonfiction films forget that they owe the audience a narrative that they encounter trouble, a fact that seems lost on many critics and is responsible for the fact that Quick Flix’s documentary shelf remains disproportionately full.
The best recent example of this is “Food, Inc.,” which was nominated along with “The Cove” for an Academy Award for Best Documentary. Although the film somehow garnered a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, its condemnation of the food industry is muddled and insubstantial despite its superb art direction.
This is a chronic problem for advocacy-focused documentaries: the ones that are aesthetically meritorious tend to sacrifice their message, and the ones that adhere strictly to a detailed, informative argument, such as “An Inconvenient Truth,” are generally unwatchable. It is unfortunate the same amount of attention is allotted to advocacy documentaries as to films that demonstrate command of form and tell engaging stories. Although they offer treatments of potent topics, too often they end with a call to action that is poorly grounded at best and fraudulent at worst.
The advocacy documentary in its present form is fundamentally bad for the presentation of important information. One cannot navigate it as easily as one can navigate text, and this is critical if one is to have a deep understanding of an argument and be able to quickly access facts. If anyone has an understanding of contemporary advocacy documentaries, however manipulative they are, it’s Michael Moore—the facts he uses in his films aren’t meant to be verified or to support an argument, but rather to endow his movies with an air of verisimilitude—’truthiness’, if you will. This aura of truth is just one thread in the tapestry of feelings his films weave in order to provoke a certain emotional reaction. This is how art operates, but it is an unwieldy method to make a nuanced intellectual argument or initiate social change.
Although I hate to say it, bad movies have a right to exist. And even if some political documentaries have made spurious claims, the bad ones have yet to make much impact (with the exception of “Fahrenheit 9/11,” which was counterproductive and galvanized opposition). The problem is that these documentaries are assigned undue importance because they tap into the collective discomfort with distant social menaces, be they eco-unfriendly food production, global warming or (most perplexingly) the corporation. Even worse than the often-slanted presentation of information is the fact that these sensational pictures often eclipse better films that are more substantial and even—perhaps—as enjoyable as fiction.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2005, physics professor Lisa Randall published “Warped Passages”—a book for the layman about the universe’s hidden dimensions—in the hopes that she might inspire the general public to contemplate the possibility of unseen worlds. What she did not expect was to inspire was a new chamber opera.
But “Hypermusic Prologue: A Projective Opera in Seven Planes” is exactly that—an original hour-long work of contemporary opera featuring music by Spanish composer Hèctor Parra and a libretto by Randall herself.
Both creators of “Hypermusic Prologue” graced the stage of the New College Theater on February 24 to participate in one of two discussions titled “Two Talks: The Art-Science Nexus.” The event, which was sponsored by the Office for the Art’s Learning From Performers Program, shed light on the creative process behind “Hypermusic Prologue” and the challenges of translating such abstract subject-matter to the stage.
“I consider this an experiment... it’s trying to project the ideas involved both musically and scientifically,” Randall said. “Hypermusic Prologue,” which premiered last June, tells the story of a baritone with a strict Newtonian view of the physical universe and his soprano partner who is determined to explore new, unseen dimensions. As she proceeds to cross over into the fifth dimension, the opera seeks to convey this journey by exploring new musical and dramatic territories. Much of the discussion focused on how Parra and Randall translated these new scientific theories to the stage through musical innovations.
For Randall, however, this project meant more than simply seeing her theories become art; she also wanted to capture the spirit of exploration in the opera, a concept she considers to be fundamental to the scientific pursuit of knowledge. Within the opera itself, Randall parallels the nature of a scientist’s calling with the soprano character’s journey through uncharted dimensions, an endeavor which has been a topic of her scholarly research for years.
While some of these finer points about the physics behind “Hypermusic Prologue” may have been lost on the crowd, the opera itself was certainly appreciated by the audience. The event incorporated videos of the original production, as well as musical recordings featuring the vocal talents of soprano Charlotte Ellett and baritone James Bobby. These multimedia elements enlivened the discussion with concrete examples of Parra and Randall’s collaborative efforts.
As demonstrated by these recordings, Parra found innovative ways of approaching physics as a musical subject. As the son of a physics professor, he was anxious to integrate his varied interests through this project. Throughout the panel, Parra described how he thought about “warping” music—manipulating elements like tempo and pitch to alter the “mass” of any given note or dilate the listener’s sense of temporality. The resulting sound he produced is quite unique—unsettling, arrhythmic, and as inscrutable as the hidden dimensions that inspired it.
Beyond his musical compositions, Parra worked tirelessly to make the opera’s lyrics feel novel. After the soprano crosses into the fifth dimension, her text was translated into what Parra described as “a free language, a multi-dimensional language.” This new tongue—which Parra himself developed specifically for this project—classifies sounds according to unusual parameters.
His specific musical notation instructed the vocalists whether to sing with a breathy or pressed voice, falsetto or fry voice, and how to position their jaws. These guidelines produce unfamiliar timbres of the human voice, which Parra then paired with unintelligible bits of sound, mostly strangled syllables and throaty gurgles that were at once alienating and captivating.
This alteration to the soprano’s text played a crucial role in demonstrating the communicative difficulties between the opera’s two characters—how do two people interact when they are in entirely separate worlds? Parra offered a succinct answer: “It was clear you couldn’t do this with typical classical music.”
“Hypermusic Prologue” has already been very successful, but it looks as if the opera will have future life as well. Besides a workshop performance at the Longy School of Music on February 27, the production will make its way in March to the Guggenheim Museum in New York.
Just as “Warped Passages” appealed to the lover of literature, so too will “Hypermusic Prologue” appeal to the music-lovers of the world and bring elements of science into an artistic scene typically void of such empirical discourse.

Portraying a relatable human story through the vehicle of a minority family, without overly racializing the content, is a delicate and difficult task. Lydia R. Diamond’s “Stick Fly”—a Huntington Theatre Company production which plays through March 28 at the Boston Center for the Arts’s Calderwood Pavilion—rises gracefully to the challenge. The show provides a snapshot of the wealthy, African-American LeVay family as it starts to head over the edge of an unseen precipice, while wittily examining class, race, gender roles, and familial relations in America. “Stick Fly” is an exercise in sharp gasps, nervous laughter, and shocked silences, culminating in a disappointingly anti-climactic ending.
The play is set in the LeVays’ Martha’s Vineyard household, which is masterfully designed by Tony Award-winning scenic director David Gallo. The cast moves fluidly through the house, whose aesthetic takes the idea of watching a “slice of life” quite literally: the set is a cross-section of the LeVay residence, providing views of the porch, kitchen, living room, and stairs, all meticulously decorated with paintings, books, and ornate details that convey the luxury of the LeVays’ lifestyle.
The two grown LeVay sons, Kent (Jason Dirden) and Flip (Billy Eugene Jones), return home for a holiday, each bringing with them a romantic interest. Kent’s girlfriend is Taylor (Nikkole Salter), an angry, intelligent, lower-middle-class black entomologist who wants nothing more than to fit in with the LeVays. Flip, on the other hand, brings home the white, wealthy Kimber (Rosie Benton), who works with lower-class students in a poor neighborhood. The two women inevitably clash, as do the two brothers. Maid Cheryl (Amber Iman) and patriarch Joe LeVay (Wendell W. Wright) observe the couples’ dynamics interestedly as they mask secrets of their own.
The six-person cast works wonders with Diamond’s script. Though a bit melodramatic at times—it is relatively unbelievable that Flip had a romantic dalliance with his brother’s future wife—the writing is incredibly sharp and funny, complementing the actors’ flawless comedic timing. In a series of humorous exchanges at the beginning of the show, the characters discuss the arrival of the “melanin-challenged” Kimber at the LeVay house. When Taylor refers to Kimber as white, Flip fires back, “She’s Italian!”—a running joke that ends when Kent and Joe greet Kimber in excited Italian, only to find out that she does not actually have a drop of Italian blood in her.
Moments like this, in which humor is used to highlight darker truths, abound in the play. Though the constant references to Kimber as Italian are funny, they also bring to light some disturbing realities about the race dynamic in America, as Flip believes an “ethnic” girlfriend would be more welcome in his family than a white one. One brief exchange between Flip and Joe captures this perfectly: when Joe claims that Flip sounds embarrassed about his white girlfriend, Flip simply replies, ”No, I’m just aware.”
Despite the abundance of talent in the play, however, not all of the acting resonates. Salter’s performance as Taylor is particularly grating. She has the difficult task of playing an awkward character with many psychological and personal issues whose behavior annoys nearly everyone in the play, and she overacts the part. Her lines are occasionally too forceful, her emotional reactions too choppy, and her gestures barely contained within the bounds of the set. In the first scene in which she drunkenly verbally spars with Benton, Salter is uncomfortable to watch, gesturing dramatically, speaking too angrily, and overacting her drunkenness.
Additionally, Salter has only minimal chemistry with the other actors. The scenes in which she and Dirden act as a supposedly “in-love” couple are awkward, and their physical contact is forced and unnatural. The only actors with whom she sparks are Wright and Jones; still, her overbearing presence feels out of place in this particular play.
Iman and Wright are the runaway stars of the play. Iman plays the part of intelligent young maid Cheryl with energy and vivaciousness tinged with sadness, hitting exactly the right note of each. Her facial expressions convey so much emotion that they almost serve as spoken lines, and she comes into her own at the end of the play when all is revealed.
As the head of the LeVay household, Wright brings a great deal of charm and multiple dimensions to his character, avoiding the stereotypes it would have been easy for him to fall into as a rich, black husband. Dirden and Benton also deliver excellent performances as Kent and Kimber, respectively, though not as outstanding as those of Iman and Wright.
“Stick Fly” is an emotionally charged production with a beautiful set, a talented cast, and a script that forces deep consideration of difficult issues. Diamond is excellent at building up emotional tension, diffusing it with humor, and then continuing to build it again to nearly unbearable levels. Unfortunately, the ending of the play leaves a bit to be desired, as this final tension fails to culminate in a satisfying conclusion; instead, the show simply fizzles out. The play’s greatest strength, however, is that it makes the story of the LeVays universal, inviting audience members of all backgrounds to share in the triumphs and heartbreak of the family.

“Artists and scientists find each other very exotic—they idealize each other,” says Professor Ruth Lingford. “Artists are in awe of scientists, and scientists find art mystifying and wonderful.” It was with the aim of encouraging collaboration between these two disciplines that Lingford and Professor Alain Viel joined forces to craft VES 54: Animating Science, offered for the first time this spring.
In this new course, students explore the intersection between art and science—both how artistic representations elucidate scientific concepts, and how those concepts can inspire and complicate art. As science becomes increasingly nanoscopic and the representation of that data more difficult to visualize, animation has begun to serve as a new visual language—one that can communicate concepts too abstract to verbalize. “The class is very experimental,” Lingford says. “There is no set body of knowledge which we are imparting to students. Instead, we hope students leave with an idea of how animation can communicate abstract concepts.” While students learn to use animation software such as Adobe Painter and Final Cut Pro, the class primarily emphasizes interdisciplinary exchange. “We want artists to take science-based ideas as a basis for art-making, as a basis for beautiful, lateral thinking,” Lingford says.
In recent years, Lingford has taught many science concentrators who were inspired to try animation after seeing “The Inner Life of the Cell,” an animated film by Harvard biology professors Viel and Robert Lue. The 8-minute clip, which illustrates a cell’s inner workings, received international attention and showcased the didactic possibilities of digital animation. Lingford contacted Viel, and together they designed Animating Science.
The class is evenly split between science and VES concentrators who share their expertise with one another. “Even though we work individually the class feels collaborative,” says Yi Liu ’10, a Chemical and Physical Biology concentrator enrolled in the class. “We view each others’ animations, and people with different backgrounds help each other out.” In the introductory meeting, Lingford and Viel led a game of Pictionary in which students were asked to draw basic scientific words, such as gravity and dilution.  They found that while some concepts could be easily represented using identifiable symbols—such as an apple falling that illustrated gravity—others, like dilution, were difficult to express in one drawing. Students have since been introduced to basic software, as well as sound recording and mixing techniques. For the most part, however, work is self-directed. For the first half of the term, students will assist neurobiologist Stephen McDonough in animating concepts central to his work. Then each will tackle an independent project.
Recent advances in animation have made the medium a useful instructive tool. Before becoming an animator, Lingford studied anatomy and physiology in order to work as an occupational therapist. When she was later asked to animate medical diagrams, she found she did not fully understand the mechanisms she’d once committed to memory. “We have that kind of experience all the time,” Lue says. “When you are asked to storyboard something, you find the gaps in your understanding. Any kind of visual representation—exercises in which students have to diagram, draw, and visualize—are very powerful, because they have to unpack what they understand about something.” Lingford explains how animation focuses viewers’ attention on the process or concept at hand: “When you have a person holding up a test tube, viewers hone in on distractions. With an animation you can hone in on what’s important.” Motion is also a key component of animation. “Animation combines both motion and the passage of time, which is true of biological processes,” Lue says. “Being able to put together an animation sequence allows you to interrogate what is really happening.”
However, scientific animation can be more than just a visual aid. With regard to “The Inner Life of the Cell,” Lue says, “It’s about communicating ideas that have never been visualized, infusing the piece with the wonder and excitement of understanding those things. It’s about communicating why science is exciting... including the wonderment of exploration and discovery that is crucial to creating such a powerful reaction.” Lue hopes to see future collaboration between scientists and artists at Harvard, as he believes both fields of thought are compatible. He points out that he and Viel storyboarded “The Inner Life of the Cell,” and then hired professional animators to bring it to life, in the same way that a conceptual artist designs a piece and brings in workmen to execute it.
“There are a lot of talented visual artists in the sciences,” says Liu. “There’s not a divide between arts and sciences, there’s a continuum. So much of science is beautiful. It is so elegant that biology has turned everything into a network of atoms and neurons that create life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Great DJing is like great sex. Think about it. The goal is for you and [the audience] to become so attuned; when you’re rockin’ out a party the energy is so contagious for everyone and it’s one of the best feelings in the world. If you get it right, you and the crowd share this wild symbiotic connection that is just euphoric.” So wrote Harvard heavyweight of the disc jockey (DJ) world George Zisiadis ’11, a.k.a. DJ Straus, via email from Grenada. Standing alone, this comment may seem overblown.
And though Zisiadis is known for his eager self-promotion, his message still rings true. Student DJs across campus emphasize the intense, empathic relationship that develops between themselves and an elated (or simply drunk) audience. Ultimately, DJs find this relationship the driving motivation behind their practice: the opportunity to make a crowd happy. Indeed, student DJs, given the amount they spend on gear, the time they spend searching for new music, and the time they spend preparing for gigs, make a mere pittiance by comparison. Moreover, they rarely find opportunities to play music beyond a repetitive and narrow set of Top 40 hits. What’s left qualifies the art of the college-aged turntablist as an ecstatic and sweaty form of community service.
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE
The art of the student DJ can range from the highly technical and complex to the facile, even the mundane. I visited Mark A. VanMiddlesworth ’10, a Crimson Arts Editor, in his dimly-lit off-campus lair on Trowbridge Street. Ballet flats, cans of beer and a bottle of Jim Bean Kentucky bourbon were strewn across the floors and tables; four guitars hung from the walls; and VanMiddlesworth and his girlfriend were disputing the location of the DJ’s rabbit Puck, which was last seen under his significant other’s desk. VanMiddlesworth was showing me his impressive collection of DJ gear, some of which he built himself.
In addition to two computers, a Kaoss Pad MIDI controller, two sets of headphones, and an assortment of other electronic odds and ends, VanMiddlesworth has built himself a portable controller. He says that the small, black box, which features nothing more than four joysticks, two pads and a touchscreen, will allow him to employ a whole range of DJing effects wirelessly. Theoretically, then, he will be able to DJ from the midst of a party’s crowd.
When asked about his beginnings as a DJ, Van Middlesworth said, “...it started out as a technical thing; I tolerated the music as a result.” In terms of the DJing techniques he uses, VanMiddlesworth said, “I like beatmatching, creating my own beats by taking loops from one song and vocals from another, layering them over each other... You can use the looping and extracting chunks of a file to make smoother transitions between songs.”
Beatmatching, one of the fundamental pillars of DJing, is the process of matching the beats per minute of a given track to that of the song that is currently playing to eliminate dissonance in the transition from one track to another. VanMiddlesworth and nearly all other DJs also ensure that their transitions include cross-fading, which is the practice of preventing gaps between tracks by gradually fazing out of one song and simultaneously introducing another.
Above and beyond these basics, VanMiddlesworth employs more difficult forms of DJing: looping, for example, is the practice of taking a short sample from a song and continuously repeating it. This craft enables DJs to build up slowly to a long-awaited chorus or, in VanMiddlesworth’s case, create an entirely new beat or transition altogether. A dedicated DJ will also work hard in advance of a gig to place a series of good cue points for all of his songs—that is, find and mark a set of perfect moments to launch into a track. Finally, VanMiddlesworth also has an extensive collection of exclusively instrumental and vocal tracks.
He has learned to lay these tracks, one over the other, seamlessly during his performances. Demonstrating, he began with the instrumental of Le Tigre’s funky “Dyke March 2001,” put on the vocals to rap quartet Spank Rock’s tellingly-titled “Coke & Wet,” moved to the vocals from Trina and Lil’ Wayne single, “Don’t Trip,” and finally changed from the Le Tigre instrumentals to a Neptunes beat. Through all of this, an unsuspecting audience would have failed to notice the numerous musical shifts.
Harvard DJs, however, can easily get away with doing the bare minimum. “The trick is that people already like the music,” said Kane Hsieh ’12. “Don’t touch the music. As long as you transition well, keep the beat smooth and play the right songs, people will love it.” In the same vein, Hsieh insists that being a DJ in a college setting does not require the complicated set of skills that artists like VanMiddlesworth treasure. “Anyone that puts in the amount of effort required by a few p-sets could learn to keep the music going. They wouldn’t be able to do the stuff that VanMiddlesworth or Straus can, but just to keep people happy at a party all you need is a few hours of software.” Though Hsieh hesitates to call himself a DJ, he also says that he has no desire to learn the art form’s more complicated techniques and plans to continue DJing parties whenever the opportunity arises.
MOB MUSICALITY
Beyond his lack of interest in technical flourishes, Hsieh also differs from many DJs in his lack of interest in broad musical knowledge. “I feel like the Top 40 is the Top 40 because it’s fun to listen to. I don’t consider myself a musical connoisseur,” he said. For most DJs, however, negotiating the divide between the Top 40 songs that most partiers want to hear and the music that they themselves most enjoy presents a challenging and ultimately defining conundrum.
Talented DJs like VanMiddlesworth and Zisiadis consider the obligation to pander a good reason to avoid Harvard’s conventional party scene. “I DJed at a bunch of places around campus at the end of sophomore year and just realized that to do that you have to stay on top of what music people are listening to. I wasn’t very good at that and didn’t want to spend so much time listening to T-Pain,” said VanMiddlesworth. Now, though, “I basically have retreated to the [Harvard] Advocate and my bedroom and the Internet,” he said.
Though Zisiadis still continues to do a lot of gigs when he is on campus, he too has moved away from house socials and towards Harvard’s periphery. “I think in general parties are forced to cater to the lowest common denominator—meaning that DJs are playing typical music that’s on anyone’s iPod. People get used to this, and expect this, and it creates a vicious cycle pretty fast,” he wrote. “I’ve definitely refused many gigs ’cause it simply wasn’t a good fit... neither I nor them would’ve been happy.”  Zisiadis, who says that he loves playing new and obscure remixes when he DJs, also says that his favorite venue is the Queen’s Head Pub, at which he has performed for Senior Bars.
Effectively, DJs like VanMiddlesworth and Zisiadis are specialty acts; the more an artist knows about DJing techniques and music, the less inclined they are to do the basic stuff that the vast majority of a crowd wants to hear. “You have to be at a place where people are expecting a DJ to do DJ things,” said VanMiddlesworth.
Nonetheless, most DJs, even those with an impressive technical background, still love playing Harvard’s campus dances and formals. “I’ve been doing this for a couple of years now, and I’ve learned the hard way that you don’t want to be too rigid about any of your principles as a DJ,” remarks Dan J. Thorn ’11, who DJed Hell at Currier’s Heaven and Hell Halloween party last semester. “If you’re rigid and get angry and [don’t] play ‘Party in the U.S.A.’ [by Miley Cyrus] or [don’t] play some song twice, then it’ll just make you more stressed out and you’ll have a worse time—your set will be worse overall.” For Thorn, songs like “Party in the U.S.A.” are not intrinsically problematic; according to him, “the mainstream party culture at Harvard is focused around a really small canon of Top 40 music but I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing... I don’t feel disappointed not playing the music I’d rather listen to on my own. That’s not what those parties would ever be about.”
Ultimately, DJing is about striking a balance between the narrow register of pop jingles and an endless catalogue of the music DJs love—what for VanMiddlesworth includes “European techno minimalist house,” but for other DJs comprises a range electronica and hip-hop. John R. Regan ’11, who was the heavenly coefficient to Thorn’s Hell at the aforementioned party, has found a way to reconcile his approach with the demands of his audience. “I’m a remix DJ,” said Regan. “Even if I do play Top 40, it’s not the original.” Still, Regan said his goal is to a find the “happy medium.” In terms of his priorities, he added, “I perform just so people can have a good time.”
COMMUNITAS ET VERITAS
On this point, all DJs seem to agree; they perform “just” so people have fun at parties. “The money is not the reason I DJ. It’s to have a good time and to put what I’ve practiced to good use and to make people happy. The money they pay me, I couldn’t care less about,” says Regan. “If people leave and say, ‘Wow, that was a great event,’ that’s all I care about. That’s it.”  Zisiadis agreed, summing up his time as a DJ with the thought that, “as far as I see it, DJing is about creating a hugely positive experience for people. It’s about enabling them to have as a good a time as possible at parties.”
As with any form of community service, making the community happy is not necessarily easy. To explain the social maneuvering involved in DJing a good party, Thorn said, “[Y]ou have to be really conscious of how many people are dancing, who is coming in, and who is leaving. You have to make sure you don’t play too many of the popular songs until there are a good amount of people [on] the dance floor... You really have to learn how to gauge your audience.” This micromanagement amounts to an extended empathy; from noting who goes and who stays, Thorn adjusts his music according to what he believes they will like. While DJing, his entire focus is centered on maximizing his crowd’s happiness.
Zisiadis presents a more narrative view. “You take people through a journey the whole night, building up the music into peaks, bringing it back down, teasing the audience, and then bringing it back up into a marvelous climax.” Though Zisiadis may lack Thorn’s reserved sensitivity, it is clear that they are saying the same thing in two different languages. For both artists, the DJing act is one devoted to crowd pleasure.
In fact, argues experienced DJ and Harvard graduate student in ethnomusicology Sarah E. Hankins, “The ideal of a good DJ is that you are in a position of service to a crowd, to the taste of the crowd.” Hankins herself puts this idea into practice. “I DJ for the queer community and I never charge for those things because that’s my community,” she said. “[Those are] the people I want to show a good time, bring together, and unite... [I want to] strengthen the idea of a queer community as opposed to a bunch of people entering a club to drink, hook up, whatever." However, unlike other forms of service, DJing puts you in an empowered, controlling relationship with those you are trying to help. "You’re sort of a shaman in a secular ritual to bring people to a place of ecstasy.” This moment, she elaborated, embodies the term “communitas,” or an “über-community feeling: [the] feeling of in a moment being boundaryless, being connected to everyone around you. The DJ is trying to maintain that feeling, picking the right song at the right time to keep the crowd dancing at this moment of ecstatic communitas.”
SEEING THE (STROBE) LIGHT
If DJing is a service-based, rapture-seeking religion, it is also a proselytizing one. After speaking with Hsieh, he whipped out a flash drive, uploaded his latest playlist and $100 of DJ software, and handed it to me. “The more people that can play at parties the better,” he said. “I’m totally for people learning how to use the software themselves.” VanMiddlesworth himself started giving advice about how to get started, and nearly every DJ reported that they learned their art under the tutelage of an older, wiser, charitable DJing friend. For the sake of their art, and for the sake of good parties everywhere, student DJs take it upon themselves to continue spreading the good word in every way they can.

Warren Beatty, who co-hosted the Oscars in 1976, summed up the event fittingly: “We want to thank all of you for watching us congratulate ourselves tonight.” On March 7, the occasion of the 82nd Academy Awards, America will do it once again.
The Oscars is the oldest media awards ceremony, and the prototype for most if its successors. But it’s an improbable television institution, in terms of both its origins and—to put it simply—just how little it has to do with television.
Emanuel Levy’s book “Oscar Fever” traces the awards back to their inception. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, founded in 1927, was the brainchild of MGM’s eponymous Louis B. Mayer. Its first awards ceremony took place in 1929—the operative logic being that the best way to legitimize the fledging industry might be to host a highly publicized event in its honor.
The Oscar ceremonies were traditionally funded by contributions from the major studios. But before the 25th Academy Awards, several of its primary financial supporters unexpectedly backed out.The Academy needed to secure another sponsor, or else to cancel the extravagance they’d planned. Just in time, RCA purchased the rights to broadcast the ceremony, and it was watched on NBC by the largest audience in the history of television at that time.
Yet, in 1953, the relationship between the film and television industries was far from friendly. Still very much a new medium, TV had conquered the country in the first few years of the decade: it constituted a tremendous improvement on radio, and watching “I Love Lucy” cost no ticket price—this correlated, not surprisingly, with a sharp drop in box office revenue. Hollywood responded with the jealous petulance you’d expect from any first-born child. Many studios forbade their contracted stars from appearing on television, and the networks—devoid of their own celebrities—were considered little more than a dumping ground (and a source of licensing fees) for stale feature films.
Televising the Oscars (the ceremonies had been broadcast on radio for some time) represented a convenient symbiosis. But the merger of film and television presented producers with a formidable challenge: how to create a program that would appeal to both the cinephile—deigning for one night to watch, shame of shames, television—and the devout TV viewer whose remote control happened to lead him there.
It is rare that anything, with the possible exception of sleeping, can hold one’s interest for four hours. But to a significant extent, the Academy Awards manages to do so, in a way that reflects the status shift in media that its broadcast entails. For the Oscars, celebrities are quite literally brought down to size—transported from a fifty-foot wide movie screen to a thirty-two-inch TV screen. The real genius of the Academy Awards broadcast is what it invites its viewers to do: fancy ourselves among the elite, if not somewhere slightly above them.
Year after year, the award categories are populated with consistent archetypes: the underdog, the obvious filler, the perhaps-not-particularly-deserving-this-year-but-boy-is-it-about-time-she-won-already. The winner selection process, intrinsically tainted by Academy politics, is anything but quantitative—statistically, even the most impulsive civilian guesser is likely to make at least one correct prediction. This lends a satisfying, authoritative feel to one’s preferences regarding, for instance, Meryl Streep—who should be given an Oscar every year, by default, just to thank her for being Meryl Streep—versus Sandra Bullock—who, incredibly, is somehow still allowed to make films after appearing in “All About Steve.”  The cult popularity of the Golden Raspberry Awards (the “Razzies”), which honor the year’s worst films, thrives on the same instinct for superiority.
Which Oscar moments do people remember? Keep in mind that—as the Academy Awards is a multi-hour ceremony that has aired on television more than fifty times—that’s a lot of moments to choose from. In general, it seems, we most enjoy those that make famous people look uncomfortable, stupid, or silly. Take any one of the inevitable bloated, overemotional acceptance speeches—technically constrained by a forty-five second time limit, but which nevertheless regularly result in millions of dollars of wasted airtime.
In 1998, James Cameron reached new heights of tacky by shouting “I’m the king of the world!” after winning Best Director for Titanic. Here’s hoping we won’t find out how he’d react to a win for Avatar.
Professionally shrill red carpet hosts encourage us to cackle at the fashion foibles of celebrities, and the same nebulous schadenfreude motivates the compiling of countless Worst Dressed Lists. TV cameras are masterfully positioned to capture deliciously revealing reaction shots; there’s nothing quite like the strained smile of someone who just lost an Oscar.

“It does not suffice for you to say I am a sweet girl,” croons Joanna Newsom on the final song of “Have One on Me.” Nor does it suffice, after listening to the new album, her third, to marginalize the gifted harpist, pianist, and singer-songwriter any longer.
For listeners not completely enamored of her unique sound, Newsom has often been identified solely by only her distinct voice and harp playing, rather than by the remarkable talent she’s always commanded as a songwriter. But “Have One on Me” unveils an adventurous, sophisticated, and newly approachable Newsom. Her talent has culminated in this three-disc, two hour masterpiece, revealing that she has both branched out musically and refined her craft. “Have One on Me” is arguably the most accessible of Newsom’s albums, though it is neither generic nor pandering to the mainstream, qualities the term “accessible” often intends to euphemize. Rather, “Have One on Me” proves Joanna Newsom capable of a stunning expanse of styles and sounds.
Much of “Have One on Me”  is a testament to Newsom’s prodigious, and perhaps unexpected, ability to incorporate outside influences into her own style. “Occident,”  the twelfth track, evokes Regina Spektor. Weighty piano chords, mirrored by the full-bodied quality of Newsom’s vocals, recall Spektor’s characteristically poignant, minimalistic ballads.  Despite the mark of external influence, however, “Occident” ultimately bears Newsom’s personal stamp. Newsom’s characteristically inscrutable lyrics shine (“Smoke-heart, curb your taste / Smoke me out of my hiding place”) and her voice maintains its youthfullness and its typical quality.
“Baby Birch,” the sixth track, also demonstrates Newsom’s ability to successfully adapt and transform previously-unexplored styles. Newsom’s voice takes on only the slightest, airy twang so that the song recalls the style of Neko Case. But the track, which approaches ten minutes in length, goes beyond a mere regurgitation of alternative country. Haphazard slips of electric guitar and banjo accent a languid harp­—which, in typical Newsom style, she fits perfectly into this country song—and as the song proceeds, dramatic harp and guitar cadences alternately build up and descend. Haunting vocal harmonies and forceful drum beats later give way to an Asian-inspired melody, rendering the song difficult to classify by conventional standards, yet still easy to listen to.
“Have One on Me” also boasts symphonic arrangements, an unfamiliar element in Newsom’s repertoire. On track nine, “In California,” theatrical strings swell to a climax topped off by the trilling of flutes and orchestral percussion. Without overpowering, the arrangements effectively enhance the harp playing which makes up the song’s foundation, and along with Newsom’s flawless vocals, they add a new and rich sound to her vast inventory.
Newsom’s vocals have never sounded more polished than on “Have One on Me.” Her singing has evolved remarkably from the piercing yowls of her previous works. While her distinctive vocal style may have held an endearing quality for devoted fans, it could be quite grating for the unintiated. On this album, however, a much clearer, controlled soprano imbues all 18 tracks with an angelic beauty. On the third track, “‘81,” as Newsom utters such lyrics as “Meet me in the Garden of Eden / …We are going to have a garden party” and “I believe in innocence, little darling,” her dulcet vocals wholly embody the purity of which she sings. Newsom demonstrates this new and impressive command of her voice throughout the album.
With the release of “Have One on Me,” Joanna Newsom’s talent comes fully to the forefront. The album successfully treads one of the finest lines many artists face and few accomplish: how to reach out to more listeners without caving to mainstream demand. Newsom has made herself more accessible while simultaneously refining her own personal style. “Have One on Me” is a superb release, and merits Newsom nothing but the highest praise.

“Are you ready to fall?” asks “Look Me in the Eye Sister,” the opening track of “Black Light,” Groove Armada’s sixth studio album. The lyric sums up the risk the band has taken on this new LP, abandoning their defining brand of filthy, glossy dance-pop and distancing themselves from their usual glow-stick-waving clientele. Instead, British duo Andy Cato and Tom Findlay offer up a more restrained, mature product, encompassing much of the greater subtlety and diversity of the whole world of dance music. Though this move carries with it the danger that Groove Armada will fall from the commercial success they have always experienced, by challenging themselves the band have produced a thoroughly intriguing album.
“Black Light” blends 1980s-inspired power chords, driving rhythms and synth waves worthy of French electronic composer Jean-Michel Jarre. Coupled with more traditional synth-pop flourishes, these elements create an uplifting, resounding musical landscape. However, it would seem that in their attempts to detach themselves from their old shtick of bouncing house music, the group have left behind a little of the infectious melodies that made them famous. But the impressive—and at times touching—musical flourishes on “Black Light” are well deserving of praise.
“Look Me in the Eye Sister” is one of the album’s true gems. An understated rock song, its heavy guitar riff is punctuated with a bristling synth energy that climbs toward a rousing climax, successfully exploiting the sultry, dulcet tones of guest vocalist Jess Larrabee. The album contains many such collaborations, which successfully harness the youthful musical energy of a diverse range of artists, including Nick Littlemore from Empire of the Sun, and British pop superstar Will Young.
Other examples of beautiful songcraft include “Cards to Your Heart” and the album’s lead single, “Paper Romance,” both of which exhibit a defiant sophistication and verve. “Paper Romance,” in particular, bristles with a beguiling otherworldliness; a combination of haunting vocals, a menacing synth background and some uplifting xylophone flourishes. This is the new Groove Armada at its most unique and bold, and progress with a subconscious, bouncing musicality; a seemingly more refined, updated version of their past house identity.
All of these changes, however, fail to produce anything of the caliber of Groove Armada’s more youthful electro-pop rivals like MGMT and Passion Pit. Whilst the dark melody and synth saturation of “Paper Romance” conspire to create something quite heartfelt and expressive, it is often quite evident throughout the album’s progression that Groove Armada is distinctly out of its comfort zone.
This is particularly clear on the pre-release single “I Won’t Kneel.” While this track manages to capture some of the glamorous, 1980s female-driven rock it strives for, it ultimately progresses with no distinct purpose, lacking the sex appeal so crucial in such anthems—providing a musical androgyny not quirky enough to be endearing, and not striking enough to be engaging.
The album’s biggest problem is that many of its songs feature such a chronic lack of melody as to be almost painful to listen to. Songs such as the laborious “Warsaw” and the ironically titled “Shameless” display a monotonous repetition, with an absence of intrigue that ultimately fails to engage. These songs exhibit what is occasionally disappointing about this bold departure—monochrome lack of imagination, which culminates in a bland, series of self-aware songs towards the album’s conclusion.
As such, “Black Light” often feels decidedly uncomfortable, like an unnerving intrusion upon a more youthful indie-electronic music scene. Perhaps the album’s greatest downfall is that it fails to target any coherent fan base, lacking the upbeat bounce that has inspired intense adoration amongst the ecstatic masses at festivals across the globe. It would seem that this shameless sense of fun has been discarded somewhere in the production process. However, this new sound marks a distinct progression in Groove Armada’s development; a refreshed musical vision that emerges during “Black Light’s” most thrilling sections, and will hopefully blossom further in Groove Armada’s future releases.

Jack Barnett is a conductor; he is not a performer. The second album from These New Puritans (TNP), “Hidden,” is an audacious break from the somewhat-restrained alternative rock of their debut, 2008’s “Beat Pyramid,” as Barnett, the group’s songwriter and vocalist, becomes the conductor of a full-blown operatic rock album. The term “operatic” conjures images of perfected, grandiose voices, melodramatic gestures and conventional melodies. But “Hidden” is no “Madame Butterfly.” The grimy rhythms and ritualistic drum beats, although woven through choral voices and a 13-piece orchestra, are channeled into an aesthetic that suits the ambience of a sweat-infused warehouse.
Returning to their British roots, TNP have referenced the Benjamin Britten opera “Peter Grimes” as an influence for their latest forray into musical experimentation. Fusing these operatic overtones with London electronica movements—dubstep and dancehall—Barnett has conceived an album which ricochets from ostentatious and oppressive climaxes to moments of melodic escapism. The result is a somewhat tiring journey, but it is a ride worth taking.
The darkly resonant, almost tribal, beats which raid songs such as “We Want War” convey an immense darkness while Barnett plots an exploration of his own personal psyche (“Three thousand thoughts in our mind / That’s when we’re slicing through time”). The orchestral movements of “We Want War”  constitute a deluge of dark intensity, particularly when the drums break into an episode of gothic-inspired choric voices, pushing the song to a climax of musical splendor.
Despite achieving moments of such expansive grandeur, the songs can at times become rather unbearable. “Orion” is one of the most pompous tracks: soaring ensemble vocals lay over incessant drum beats, drowning out Barnett’s own simplistic vocal droning. The result is certainly powerful, reminiscent of the melodramas of opera, however in merging so many elements the song loses the beauty and resonance of its simplicity.
Although tracks such as “Orion” can seem contrived, the beautiful levity and simplicity of “Hologram” punctuates this heaviness. “Hologram” retains the ceaseless drum beats which adorn every track, but here they are lighter and seem to caress the piano melody. Meanwhile, Barnett’s unpretentious voice is freed from the digital modification it goes through elsewhere. In holding back from electronic manipulation and overt classicism, TNP unearth a true gem. “Hologram” is a small nest of musical escapism, and the lyrics tackle a similar theme—“Shut the door / Because I’m staying here / The world might disappear / Under blankets of snow.” The song offers relief from the tracks surrounding and overcrowding it; it is a true exploration of the band’s musical abilities.
The songs which shine on this album are those in which Barnett’s voice is allowed to emerge from the shadows. His simple and rough vocals bring the fantastical nature of many of the operatic pieces back to an earthly level. “White Chords” maintains a heavy electronic presence, though the instrumental backdrop serves to credit Barnett’s voice. His already rough sound seems even lazy, yet effective, as he murmurs and croaks into the microphone. Losing the operatic immensity but retaining many of its stylistic elements, this track achieves a hedonistic unity between the dubstep beats and classical influences—a unity that is missing on other tracks.
TNP have attempted something on an immense scale. Their ambition sometimes gets the better of them. The incorporation of operatic influences into electronic experimentation often forms overstuffed tracks with too great an intensity. While the beats embrace a dancehall headiness, there are moments when the variety of elements do not quite merge into a coherent contiguity of meaning and sound. Their attempt is interesting and provocative and it is an ambitious step which deserves merit for its imagination. It almost works, but “Hidden” narrowly misses its target.

“Smoke and Mirrors” seeks to reproduce the commercial success of Lifehouse’s earlier albums and singles, some of which attained wide commercial success and reached the Billboard Top 10, including 2005 hit “You and Me.” Though many of the songs on “Smoke and Mirrors” fit the mold of these earlier successes, the album as a whole falls short of moving the band forward, as little attempt is made to alter their musical style or voice.
It is not that Lifehouse’s sound or their songs are mediocre. Most of them are actually catchy and easy to listen to. However, “Smoke & Mirrors” lacks the boldness and initiative to be a truly impressive album, failing to incorporate new tonal or vocal elements from one song to the next. This musical complacency reveals itself as the album’s primary shortcoming. Rather than deviate from a formula which has provided some success in the past, the band instead choose to produce songs based primarily off of the same tried-and-true formula. There are slow and more upbeat songs on the album, but each type is constructed in largely the same fashion: a solid guitar intro accompanied by drums until a very cyclic melody is established, finished off with some unmemorable lyrics and an anthemic chorus.
Indeed, much as each song seems to rotate on the axis of a strong chorus, the album as a whole hinges upon the success and appeal of one or two singles. “Falling In” and “Halfway Gone” establish themselves on first listen as the album’s peaks, and much of the rest of the album’s sound and subject matter mirror the highlights of these two songs.
Unsurprisingly, some of the album’s more memorable lyrics, driven by upbeat but repetitive guitar chords, are found here. On “Falling In,” frontman Jason Wade sings, “Every time I see your face / My heart takes off on a high speed chase,” and promises, “I would never do you wrong / Or let you down or lead you on.” “Halfway Gone” takes up a similarly melodramatic theme, Wade singing, “Talk, talk is cheap / Give me a word you can keep.” These themes, however, are too often repeated throughout the remainder of the album, and the concoction of hope, despair, and love which defines many of the songs begins to lose its potency with its continued repetition.
“Smoke & Mirrors” makes few attempts at breaking away from the mold it casts for itself, but the rare displays of creativity among the myriad repetitions are quite welcome. “Wrecking Ball” features distant vocals and more original songwriting based on the lyrics as a whole rather than just the chorus.  The refrain very simply states, “And I’m always swinging on this wrecking ball / While you’re building up and breaking down my wall.” Although this is repeated three times throughout the song, the chorus is sung through soft background vocals, allowing the verses between each iteration to steal some of the spotlight. Indeed, those lyrics prove to be some of the most interesting on the album, as Wade sings, “I’m a fool, a mechanical tool for you / Cause you got all the switches and levers to blow my cool.”
In a similar fashion, “Here Today, Gone Tomorrow,” marks the band’s sole instance of musical experimentation. In a departure from the soft rock which defines much of the rest of the album, this track is marked by a heavier bass line and more reverb. Much like the rest of the album, however, the lyrics still leave a little to be desired—“You’re all talk and nothing to say / We don’t want, don’t want what you’re giving away” runs the much repeated and emotionally-empty refrain. The attempt at alteration is at least admirable, however, given the rather repetitive nature of the rest of the album, however.
Overall, “Smoke & Mirrors” is marked largely by a rinse, wash, repeat cycle of music with very limited tonal shifts, alteration in subject matter, or attempts at breaking the band’s music-writing norm. Taken individually, the songs are largely appealing and easy to listen to, but in the context of the record as a whole, many of the elements are lost due to mere repetition, a problem which plagues the album throughout.

“Permalight” finds Rogue Wave in transition. The Bay Area indie band’s first two albums, 2003’s “Out of the Shadows” and 2005’s “Descend Like Vultures,” were both critically praised as mixtures of lo-fi acoustic numbers, rockers, and soulful, sometimes morose pop songs, drawing endless comparisons to classic indie bands like Built to Spill and The Shins. Before their 2007 follow-up, “Asleep at Heaven’s Gate,” they were dropped by their Sub Pop label, but found a home with Jack Johnson’s Brushfire Records. That album found them moving in a new direction, embracing a more highly produced aesthetic that used studio effects to create a spacey and dreamy sound.
The band continues in a similar direction on “Permalight,” not only by incorporating studio sounds, but making them a fundamental part of the album. If a return to the lo-fi sounds of their early recordings seemed unlikely after “Asleep at Heaven’s Gate,” “Permalight” makes it seem almost impossible. Rogue Wave haven’t lost their penchant for crafting incredibly appealing hook-laden melodies, which ensure the memorable impression “Permalight” leaves.
“Solitary Gun,” the album’s opening track, is perhaps its most satisfying. From a sparse acoustic guitar opening, frontman Zach Rogue quietly asks a simple romantic question, “Will I follow you down the line?” As soon as he asks, the acoustic guitar picks up and the listener is drawn into a hook-laden, delightfully melodic song. The most pleasing aspect is the limited studio production, which leaves mostly unadorned the song’s mix of acoustic and electric guitar, drums backed up with handclaps, and bass.
The rest of the album’s first half is driven more by electronic beats, heavy rhythms, and layered vocal harmonies, however, giving Side A its catchy and occasionally danceable sound. On “Good Morning (The Future),” Rogue states, “The future / isn’t what it used to be / I’m not surprised.” With this, he seems to sum up the band’s current direction: a perhaps-not-unexpected move from an intimate sound into more electronic pop.
Although Rogue’s melodic vocals fit beautifully into his band’s arrangements, there are points at which his artistic wisdom comes into question. He sometimes sings with an oddly affected British accent, particularly on the otherwise appealing “Stars and Stripes.” Though that song is capable of overcoming Rogue’s misstep, on “You Have Boarded,” his vocals make the song sound like a poor Franz Ferdinand B-side.
Lyrically, the album isn’t particularly fascinating or thought-provoking. At their worst, the lyrics are inane nonsense—“Never had a false alarm / Softer than a baby’s arm”—but there are moments that are much cleverer—“All I have is time / To bring back this bloodline of mine.” However, considering the fact that Rogue’s voice is sometimes inaudible over the band’s walls of sound, this weakness doesn’t seem to be a major concern for the band.
The most disappointing aspect of the album, though, is its lack of intimacy. The electronic beats and layered guitars become wearying, particularly in the album’s second half. This is true even on the slower songs, like the throwaway closer “All that Remains” and the otherwise enjoyable “Sleepwalker,” which is clearly in the vein of vintage Built to Spill. These tracks present a dreamlike atmosphere reminiscent of Rogue Wave’s early albums, but sabotage this with an ever-present driving beat that prioritizes a misplaced musical dynamism over subtle songwriting.
Rogue Wave fail to completely move away from their indie intimacy, yet can’t come to terms with embracing their newfound love of the studio, which is better used on the album’s first half. Instead, the band occasionally takes a middling arena-rock approach, weakening the songs by starving them of the sentiment of their earlier work, while trying to build upon the grandiose and bombastic statements of their third album.
This is not to say “Permalight” is a bad record, but it’s certainly an uneven one. The captivating hooks of the album’s first half showcase an engaging sound for the band, but the second half never reaches those heights. At this point in their career, it’s understandable that Rogue Wave is in transition, but they haven’t yet quite figured out how to effectively innovate their core sound.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Better late than never—last week, Yale became the last Ivy League school to include a gender-neutral housing option in its housing policy. Under the new guidelines, rising seniors can choose to live in mixed-gender suites but not mixed-gender bedrooms, although students in romantic relationships are strongly encouraged not to live with each other. This decision, albeit somewhat limited in scope, is a positive step on the part of the Yale administration toward providing an environment for its students to live in that is as comfortable and desirable as possible.
Yale’s policy change is especially significant because of the particular nature of student housing at the school. Like the Harvard house system, Yale’s residential college system is designed to encourage students to stay on campus throughout their four years. However, it seems that the system doesn’t work quite as well as Yale would like—a recent Yale Daily News article cited a figure of 20 to 30 percent of upperclassmen living off campus. Given that many students who live off the Yale campus cite housing restrictions as a motive for leaving the residential college system, it is reasonable to assume that the proposed changes may encourage students to move back on campus and cause fewer students to leave in the first place.
Additionally, providing students with an option to live in a mixed-gender suite appropriately reflects the Yale administration’s trust in the ability of its collegians to make mature decisions about their living arrangements. After all, it is the students who clamored for an alteration in Yale’s housing rules, and student activist groups—such as the Yale College Council and the LGBT Cooperative— deserve praise for their efforts to engineer a policy change. It is gratifying to see that Yale administrators clearly listened and responded to student concerns.
Obviously, by granting students the right to live in mixed-gender suites, Yale runs the risk that a handful of couples will take advantage of the change and choose to live together, despite discouragement from college officials. The benefits of mixed-gender suites, however, mitigate that small risk. Additionally, refusing to introduce a gender-neutral policy would have ignored the fact that homosexual couples may already have been living together in single-gender suites. Among many others, one of the key benefits of Yale’s housing policy change is that it helps remove this type of normative judgment on students’ lifestyles and preferences, even if that judgment and discrimination was entirely unintentional on the college’s part.
Hopefully, Yale will soon extend gender-neutral housing options to all upperclassmen. Yale freshmen, like Harvard freshmen, are placed in randomized housing arrangements, making gender-neutral arrangements much more difficult. Harvard already makes provisions for entering first-year transgender students, should they request special housing arrangements, as well as options for transferring rooms after arriving on campus. That being said, the Freshman Dean’s Office is justified in seeking to create diverse rooming assignments, and we hope that students are comfortable abiding by the FDO’s decisions.
Students at other universities—where living off campus is the norm and not the exception—already have complete control over whom they share living space with and are responsible for making smart decisions (such as choosing not to room with a significant other because a break-up would cause utter disaster). Colleges like Yale and Harvard, which pride themselves on having most of their students live on campus throughout their undergraduate experience, should also trust their students to use good judgment. Freeing up housing restrictions is a step in that direction, and will hopefully make living on campus as enjoyable as possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For one long week—perhaps President Obama’s longest since taking office—it was all about the banks. On Jan. 21, a New York Times headline read, “Obama to Propose Limits on Big Banks,” while the Motley Fool, a website dedicated to financial issues, blurted, “Bank Regulation: Sometimes Populism is Justified.” But shortly thereafter, with all of the buzz surrounding Obama’s State of the Union address and the renewed concern about unemployment levels, the banks fell off the agenda and haven’t been heard about since.
Holdups in the Senate have made it unlikely that any significant banking legislation will pass, but that is a moot point, Obama’s plan to curb risky investing by commercial banks is nothing more than a cynical attempt to gain populist support at a time when his domestic agenda is flagging. But if the failure of the banking bill presents Obama with an opportunity to initiate a new phase of his presidency, he needs to abandon more than just his financial policy: the entire populist strategy that it represented has to go as well.
Populism has been on everybody’s minds lately, probably because a populist group was responsible for many of Obama’s troubles in the wake of the Massachusetts senate race that catapulted Republican Scott Brown to Washington.  The Tea Party movement, organized last spring around a shared disapproval of reckless spending in Washington, DC, was crucial for mobilizing support for Brown during the race. Over the past several months, the movement has grown so popular that, according to a recent New Yorker article, it would attract more support than the Republican Party if it were to become a registered political affiliation.
Yet the same article also highlights some of the pitfalls of populism in its portrayal of the Tea Partiers as a cross between a social activist group and a Glenn Beck-worshipping cult. Not only is the Tea Party’s homophobic and racist rhetoric offensive (a Tea Party protest in Washington last September included signs saying “The Zoo Has an African Lion and the White House Has a Lyin’ African!”), but their tactics are self-defeating.
Like all populist movements, the Tea Partiers base their ideology around a divide between political elites and “ordinary” citizens victimized by Washington’s insider culture. But in order to spread their ideology, the populists must ensure that politicians sharing their views reach political office—in other words, ensure that these politicians participate in the very culture the populists claim to reject. Consequently, the ideology of the Tea Party directly limits its chances for success. The Tea Partiers either have to sacrifice their populist beliefs or their influence, the former leading to their incorporation within mainstream politics and the latter leading to their total disappearance from it. This explains the tendency of some Tea Partiers to distance themselves from Scott Brown after his victory; during his first broadcast after the election, Glenn Beck, an advocate for the Tea Party movement, criticized Brown and said his time in office “could end with a dead intern. I’m just saying.”
This conundrum also explains the failure of Obama’s own populist pleas. Populism is less a coherent set of beliefs than an anti-ideology, defining itself entirely by its opposition to political elites; once it takes part in this system of elites through electoral success, its failure to articulate a set of ideals results in its demise. Sensing the populist anger that resulted in Scott Brown’s victory, Obama tried to tap into it, but his efforts necessarily failed; as an elected official, he was a participant in the Washington culture that the Tea Partiers despised, and the rest of Americans took his dramatic proclamations with the grain of salt most populism deserves. In other words, his plans and his populist rhetoric appealed to no one, least of all the Senate now blocking the proposed bank legislation.
During his State of the Union, Obama’s vow to veto any Congressional acts that didn’t measure up to his standards of “real reform” represented his descent into the populist trap; rather than articulating a clear ideology or outlining what “real reform” looks like, he simply promised to reject proposals offered by others. Obama’s plan to limit commercial bank activity represented an even more extensive use of populist rhetoric, and its populist nature is now revealed by the fact that it has barely been mentioned in the weeks since the subject was first broached. In the desperate moments following the Massachusetts Senate race, Obama sought an “elite” group to blame, and Wall Street bankers provided a perfect, easy target. His failure to outline a clear plan explains the holdup now preventing banking reform, and his focus on blaming the banks rather than reforming them represents the keystone failure of the populist ideology.
Obama needs to acknowledge the populist criticisms directed at him without exploiting the techniques that his critics employ. Doing so is the only way he can move forward, which is, after all, what he promised in his forward-looking, hope-saturated campaign. The American people deserve for Obama to deliver on his promises, and he can start by abandoning the populist rhetoric that he employed during his latest debacle with the banks.

Harvard’s house system is often cited as one of the best parts of our social life, enabling students to get to know a small cross-section of the large undergraduate population. The dining hall is a central place in any house’s life, especially at meal times, so conveniently located river houses have been trying for years to keep outsiders out, resorting to gongs, no-pants dinners, and the more conventional inter-house dining restrictions. However, if dining restrictions were made with the realities of the lives of Harvard students in mind, they could be a lot more efficient, preventing overcrowding in the nearest houses while allowing residents of the others to eat without having to trek back to their own houses or resort to greasy pizza from Noch’s.
With seven of the nine river houses now imposing restrictions of some kind, when you don’t have time to make the 30-minute round trip back to the Quad for a meal, finding a place to eat in a dining hall that doesn’t treat non-residents like criminals can prove difficult. Although HUDS does a great job of making quick meals for students who don’t have time to eat at their dining halls as palatable as possible, no one can argue that Fly-By and bag lunches are an acceptable substitute for a hot meal in a dining hall, in terms of either taste or nutritional value. Since we all pay the same amount for room and board, some of us should not be relegated to cold turkey sandwiches and limp iceberg lettuce simply because we live too far away to go home for lunch.
Restrictions also make dining with residents of other houses more difficult. The one resident, one guest policy can cause problems for groups of diners that include residents of multiple houses. For example, since I live in the Quad, when I want to eat dinner with friends who live in, say, Winthrop and Lowell, the three of us have no choice but to join the crowds in one of the view houses without restrictions.
While I have never had to fight for a seat in my house’s dining hall, I understand the space crunch in other dining halls that encourages the more conveniently located houses to institute dining restrictions. The restrictions don’t need to make finding a place to eat more difficult for everyone else, however. There are a few simple things that could be done right now to help ease some of the congestion.
Weekly community dinners, for one thing, are a great idea in principle, as a way to encourage house community without excluding non-residents the rest of the time. However, three of the most popular river houses (Quincy, Leverett and Kirkland) all hold community dinners on Thursdays, so all non-residents who would normally go to these dining halls, as well as residents who want to eat with friends who aren’t residents, must find somewhere else to eat. Spreading these community dinners out over different nights would reduce stress on the remaining dining halls, while still fostering house community.
More fundamentally, it may be time for other river houses to follow the example of Adams and Pforzheimer Houses and make exceptions that will allow residents of each of the more inconveniently located houses to dine at a closer one. Welcoming the residents of one other house, especially in the more spacious dining halls, will give residents of farther houses a place to eat without making it impossible for residents to eat in their own dining halls.
The administration needs to recognize that inter-house dining is a reality of campus life. It needs to stop ignoring the problems that the current restrictions are creating, and consider stepping in to mandate more reasonable restrictions, if necessary. Harvard’s house system is a great part of campus social life, but we need to make sure that promoting house life in the river houses doesn’t end up leaving others out in the cold.

Weekday omelets and French toast may be on their way back to Harvard, if the Undergraduate Council has its way.  In a recent, preliminary report on the aftermath of hot breakfast cuts, the UC presented the findings of a 769-student survey on wellbeing.  The document detailed the dietary repercussions of the new breakfast arrangement, including a decrease in protein options that could create nutritional deficiencies.  Additionally, the UC provided potential suggestions for administrative changes to dining options, such as closing two Quad houses at lunch time, in exchange for opening one Quad and one river house for hot breakfast each day.  The survey data and suggestions will become the foundation for discussion at the next Committee on Student Life meeting this Thursday.
We commend the UC for moving forward on cost-neutral solutions to the current lack of hot morning options.  While “bringing back hot breakfast” may seem like a tall order in the face of school-wide budget cuts, Bowman and Hysen deserve praise for setting the foundation to fulfill their campaign promise in a realistic and efficient manner.
Although the UC’s report is only a small, preliminary step forward, their suggestions for dining reform are no less sensible.  We strongly support the proposal to open one Quad and one river house for hot breakfast and close two Quad houses for lunch.
Such an arrangement would ensure a quality dining experience across campus.  Providing hot breakfast in both the Quad and on the River every day would help ameliorate the problem of nutritionally deficient diets suggested by the preliminary report.  Students most affected by the reduction in selection—such as athletes, those with special dietary restrictions, and early risers in need of a brain boost—would enjoy an immediate increase in wellbeing.
Reinstating hot breakfast in only two houses would prevent the former inefficiency cited as the primary justification for hot breakfast cuts. Since only one House in each residential area would provide heated offerings, breakfasters would consolidate, avoiding the surplus food and service that characterized the previous system.  Furthermore, given the propensity for Quad residents to eat lunch on the river, this solution would reduce lunchtime waste in the Quad.  Finally, the proposal is—at least conceptually—cost-neutral. Assuming costs of providing food and services for both meals are similar, replacing two lunches with two dinners should theoretically have little impact on the HUDS budget.
Finally, we find it encouraging that an expression of strong student opinion has not gone unheard by the UC.  Hot breakfast was a key issue during the presidential and vice presidential campaigns earlier this year, and the current report is clearly a response to undergraduate demand. When it comes to hot breakfast, the UC seems to be fulfilling its role by bringing student concerns to the administration. In light of this, we encourage students to raise their voices with similar force in the future and hope that the UC continues to listen.

The hippies have grown old. Those in their carefree 20s during the 1960s are now past retirement age and, throughout their lifetimes, have brought a demographic shift in marijuana use. A new United States government report reveals that the number of 55-59 year olds who use cannabis has tripled since 2002, suggesting an upsurge in families with stoned grandparents at the head. Given the increased popularity of marijuana amongst an age group associated with sobriety, it seems pertinent to re-examine the substance’s illegal status. Marijuana is undeniably a drug with negative side effects, just like any other. However, relative to the crime and harm caused by its illegal market, the benefits of decriminalizing the drug far outweigh the cost.
Marijuana’s harmful heath effects are not the falsified tales of scaremongers. In the short term, the drug causes drowsiness and memory problems, and, in high doses, (usually when eaten) can lead to impaired memory and hallucinations. A user has four times the usual risk of a heart attack in the first hour after smoking, and, in the long run, marijuana causes the same respiratory problems as tobacco and makes you three times more likely to develop neck and lung cancer. However, it has yet to be confidently shown that these effects are worse than those of alcohol and tobacco, and indeed there is evidence that marijuana is less addictive than both.
Conversely, the cost and crime caused by the criminalisation of cannabis is definite and serious. Jeffrey Miron, a Harvard economics professor, estimates that approximately 13.7 billion dollars of savings per year would result from the legalization of marijuana. In the past five years, there were around 850,000 marijuana-related arrests per year (around 750,000 of which were merely for possession): evidence that prohibition costs police time as well as money. Meanwhile, Miron estimates that the government would generate around 6.4 billion dollars per year from tax revenue on the drug. In other words, the legalisation of marijuana would earn the U.S. government 20 billion dollars per year.
While the US government misses out on these funds, drug dealers pocket even more due to the dangerous nature of production—an estimated 35.8 billion dollars per year. Drug dealers tend to sell more than one type of substance, and so profits from marijuana sales are used to fund the market for more dangerous drugs. Thus the net worth of the market gives vast amounts of power and money to criminal dealers. Furthermore, those who buy marijuana illegally are introduced into the criminal world and thus granted a gateway into more serious drugs and felonious behaviour. On Harvard’s own campus, the most serious problems arise not from substance abuse, but violent crimes based on drug dealership, such as last year’s Kirkland shooting.
In addition to being expensive and encouraging further illegal behavior, the prohibition on cannabis has been largely ineffective. Marijuana use has increased slightly over the past few years amongst adolescents; indeed, e-TOKE (Harvard’s online marijuana educate program) reports that ten per cent of Harvard students use the substance. It has also been shown that some of the highest marijuana-use figures exist in countries with harsh laws, such as U.S. and Britain. Some ascribe this to cultural differences; however, although Sweden and Norway are culturally fairly similar, Sweden has far harsher drug laws while they both have the same level of addiction rates. Thus there is little evidence to suggest that criminalisation is effective in reducing drug-use.
A concern is occasionally voiced that if cannabis were legalized, more would use the drug and would, in turn, be tempted to try more dangerous drugs. Although it seems realistic to assume that marijuana usage will increase as it becomes more safe and accessible, it may not necessarily be the case. The decriminalisation of marijuana in Amsterdam did not lead to increased drug use, and it can be argued that the absence of a risk factor will deter some from pursuing the drug, and certainly from reckless abuse. Indeed, the popularity of cannabis amongst older generations could completely eradicate any rebellion factor and ensure that marijuana would mainly be used in the same controlled environment as alcohol and tobacco. As for the concern that marijuana use is dangerous because it encourages users to try worse drugs, evidence shows that tobacco is a larger indicator of a tendency to harder drugs than marijuana. There is thus no reason to suggest that once classed alongside tobacco, those who tried cannabis would be greatly inclined to try more dangerous drugs.
The ill effects of marijuana use are real but limited. The economic cost of criminalising the substance, together with its implicit encouragement and funding of further illegal activity, makes its unlawful status seem senseless. Should cannabis be legalized, those who choose to use the substance would be likely to do so in a far more responsible manner, while the money saved would be a much-needed boost to the state. To decriminalize marijuana would be a controversial move, and the presence of concerned-parent lobby groups means that such a policy is unlikely to pass any time soon. However, a balanced examination of the costs and benefits of prohibition reveals that the policy is irrational. The government should learn from the hippie mantra of freedom, and abolish restrictions on marijuana.

Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) Dean Cherry A. Murray discussed the future of SEAS  during her second “All-Hands Meeting” yesterday afternoon, where she presented plans to tap into the school’s financial reserves to fund continued faculty and staff growth.
Murray, who hopes to host four of these meetings next academic year, addressed more than 100 students and faculty members as she outlined a 10-year plan to hire 50 new faculty members in order to reach a target of 100 Full Time Equivalent faculty.
“There aren’t really enough faculty in each discipline to do the effective teaching we need for the 21st century,” Murray said. “The board of overseers and the president and provost agree with that. So our growth will be high priority.”
Murray repeatedly emphasized the ways in which the core mission of SEAS may be threatened by a failure to expand the teachers on its payroll.
She noted that 30 percent of current SEAS faculty members are 60 years of age or older. added that professors in applied math, computer science, and engineering are currently running the risk of “burning out” and consequently may seek offers from rival research institutions.
“We need to be at critical mass so we have both the breadth and the depth to tackle global programs,” Murray said.
But the projected endowment payout for SEAS next year will be reduced by 12 percent, which amounts to a significant decrease given that 40 percent of SEAS’ budget is supported by its endowment.
Murray said she hoped to pad the SEAS budget by cutting down cash reserves and increasing aggressive fundraising efforts. In addition, she promised not to terminate current staff members, instead pledging to increase the number of staff hires.
Murray also discussed “rethinking” introductory courses in applied math, computer science, and engineering sciences, and said she supported offering a class similar to Life Sciences 1a and 1b—staple courses that funnel undergraduates into those departments.
“I think at this point, it’s important to think about learning outcomes,” Murray said. “Certainly having gateways that are good for students is very important.”
Murray also used the event to award Yakov Berenshteyn ’10 with a $1,000 scholarship for engineering excellence and Professor of Computer Science Margo I. Seltzer ’83 with the Capers and Marion McDonald Award for Excellence in Teaching and Mentoring.

Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker withdrew her candidacy for the Mass. State Senate yesterday, saying that her chances of winning the seat were too slim to justify continuing her campaign.
“When the Special Election for State Senate was first announced, I considered the prospects for victory extremely promising,” Decker wrote in a statement. “Since I announced my candidacy, the number of candidates has increased dramatically—more than doubling—thus my chances of winning have been greatly reduced. In good conscience, I cannot ask my family, friends and supporters to give more time, effort and financial support if there is no realistic prospect of success.”
A special election for the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex State Senate seat will be held on May 11. The seat was vacated in January when former Senator Anthony D. Galluccio was imprisoned for an alcohol-related probation violation. While the ballot for the special election will not be finalized until next Wednesday, as many as ten candidates may be seeking the seat.
Decker’s campaign Manager Jeni M. Wheeler said that “Marjorie does not back down from a fight,” pointing to her exhaustive write-in campaign that won her a sixth term on the City Council in November. Decker had failed to file her paperwork in time for her name to appear on the ballot.
But Wheeler said that Decker and her campaign team concluded this weekend that it is “nearly impossible for anyone but the Everett candidate to win” the seat. She noted that Everett has historically produced 40 percent of the voters in special elections for the district—and Sal DiDomenico, Galluccio’s chief of staff, is the sole candidate from Everett.
Furthermore, Wheeler predicted that the 20 percent of the electorate that typically hails from Cambridge will split its votes among the three remaining Cambridge candidates—Dennis A. Benzan, Timothy R. Flaherty, and City Councillor E. Denise Simmons.
But Flaherty’s campaign is not simply counting on Cambridge voters, according to Flaherty’s media consultant Dorie R. Clark, a graduate of Harvard Divinity School.
“We’re definitely not relying solely on one city for a preponderance of votes or our campaigning,” Clark said. “We feel very fortunate that our campaign has the funding and the broadbased support of a varity of organizations.”
In addition to Cambridge and Everett, the contested district includes Allston, Brighton, Charlestown, Chelsea, Revere, Saugus, and Somerville.

As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences prepares its budget for the upcoming fiscal year, the administration will turn its attention to area-study centers to streamline spending of FAS resources, sparking concern among some center leaders.
In a meeting on Friday, directors of FAS centers—such as the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs—met with FAS Dean Michael D. Smith to review FAS budgeting policy implemented last spring, at the height of the University’s fiscal woes.
The policy—termed the “first-dollar principle”—identifies areas across FAS that constitute core expenses and focuses on allocating resources in accordance with the established priorities.
But FAS leaders have yet to delineate the details of its “core priorities,” and the lack of clarity has left some center adminstrators wondering whether placing decision-making power in the hands of the top rung of FAS will undermine their own stake in the budgetary planning process.
In interviews with The Crimson yesterday, several FAS center adminstrators said that the policy may enable top adminstrative leadership in FAS to tailor centers’ funds to fit FAS priorities, which might not necessarily align with those of the centers.
“There is a lot of negotiating taking place,” said Government Professor and Interim Director of the Weatherhead Center James A. Robinson, who declined to comment on the specifics of Friday’s meeting.
Robinson added that the issue may be broached at today’s Faculty meeting, though such an item is currently not listed on the pre-distributed agenda.
The meeting with center adminstrators marked the first of a series of discussions between center administrators and FAS to take place over the semester.
Geology Professor Daniel P. Schrag, the director of the Center for the Environment—which is funded by the Office of the Provost rather than the FAS
administration—said he supports FAS administrators’ goals.
“The director should have an obligation to be responsive to the priorities of the dean,” Schrag said.
Director of the Center for American Political Studies Daniel Carpenter said that the first-dollar principle aligned with his own center’s commitment to student research.
Unlike other centers that focus on faculty research and visiting scholar programs, CAPS prioritizes its funding for undergraduate and graduate fellowships, Carpenter said.
The new policy will push centers to “not just be a faculty bastion, a little enclave away from the university,” he added.
But Carpenter also noted that the first-dollar principle was a newly-developed policy, subject to changes. “How’s it going to be when the rubber hits the road?” he said.
FAS currently has an $80 million deficit, an improvement from the $110 million deficit Smith cited at the beginning of this academic year.
Though administrators say they are pleased with the results of last year’s budget-cutting measures—including a wave of layoffs and an early retirement package for staff—Smith described the remaining sum as “huge,” earlier this year.
In a letter sent to department and center administrators early last month, FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 sought to clarify the ongoing budgeting approach based on the first-dollar principle.
“This year’s budget process will be more in concert with this principle by placing a greater level of focus on core expenses,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While strides have been made to increase faculty and staff diversity, University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a campus-wide e-mail, women and minorities remain underrepresented in many campus circles. The latest development in the effort to diversify focuses on the university’s non-faculty workforce, an endeavor lead by newly appointed Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman.
Coleman joined the administration in Mass. Hall two weeks ago as Chief Diversity Officer, and will now be responsible for taking the lead in ensuring staff diversity.
According to Faust’s community e-mail, 60 percent of Harvard staff are women and 22 percent are people of color, but only 12 percent of those have attained leadership positions.
Coleman said in an interview with The Crimson yesterday that efforts to improve diversity on campus center not only around quantitative factors, like more minority hires, but also on qualitative aspects, like the community’s attitude towards minority staffers.
“This is an era when the notion of diversity is changing,” Coleman said. “This is an opportunity for Harvard to talk about what it means to have a diverse campus.”
Yesterday’s e-mail continues a long-standing effort by Faust to improve diversity on campus. Faust ascended to the Presidency in 2007 under the shadow of former University President Larry Summers’ comments alleging that the relatively low number of tenured women in science and math departments might be explained by women having a lower aptitude for those subjects than men.
During Faust’s time as President, women have made gains among the faculty and administrative staff, attaining more senior level positions at the University. Faust noted that she was the only female dean in 2001; now there are five.
Still, efforts to open employment opportunities to women on campus have proceeded slowly, according to the 2009 Faculty Development and Diversity Report. Harvard’s proportion of women junior professors, for example, lags behind peer institutions in many fields, the report states.
Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer, whose office prepared the report, said that comparisons to peer institutions were difficult to gauge and that the strides Harvard has made are more pertinent to the University.
“The statistics document what you could say was amazing success,” Singer said yesterday. “Forty-six percent of junior faculty in the social sciences at Harvard are women—that’s amazing.”
Still, Singer admitted that there was progress to be made to increase the number of “underrepresented minorities”—a category defined by Faust’s letter as African-Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans—on Harvard’s faculty. Those minorities make up only about 6 percent of the University’s ladder faculty, according to the e-mail.

In response to growing student interest in politics and public service, the Institute of Politics will hire a full-time career counselor to help students at the College find long-term jobs in politics.
For the last few years the IOP has hoped to strengthen its career service offerings, and the recent growth in students seeking political jobs, coupled with the record number of applicants to the Director’s Internship program have encouraged the Institute to move forward, said IOP Director Bill Purcell.
Purcell said that despite University-wide budget constraints, the creation of the position was a priority for the IOP this spring. However, there is no firm timeline for hiring the career counselor, according to IOP Director of Communications and Marketing Esten Perez.
The position will complement the IOP’s current internship advising programs, according to IOP Internships Director Amy A. Howell.
While the IOP currently offers programs and support for summer positions, Howell said that the new career counselor will be able to provide guidance to students who are frustrated by the difficulty of finding long-term positions.
“We’re never going to get to a point where careers in government are as straightforward to get as a job at JP Morgan,” said IOP Vice President Sarah E. Esty ’11. “We’re trying to make it less mystifying, less based on who you know or just serendipity of what you come across when you’re Googling.”
The new career adviser will also strengthen the collaboration between the IOP and the Office of Career Services, OCS Director Robin Mount said. Students can use OCS as a general resource in the job search process, Mount said, but this new staffer will be able to provide more targeted direction and greater resources to students with an interest in politics.
Mount hopes to meet regularly with the staffer to coordinate joint programming that will increase support for students pursuing political careers.
Leaders of student political groups praised the IOP’s acknowledgment of the need to provide career planning support beyond internship offerings.
“In general, political jobs don’t lend themselves quite as well to on-campus recruiting,” said Harvard College
Republicans President Mark A. Isaacson ’11. “A lot of times these jobs, while they certainly exist, are not necessarily as visible on campus.”
Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, President of the Harvard College Democrats, said he hopes to establish a relationship between the new staff member and the Dems.
“The greatest advantage would be the potential for some form of institutional memory. Right now it’s sort of ad hoc, in that you get a campaign or a political organization that needs interns for one summer,” said Berkenfeld. “One individual that is at the IOP for the long-term can accumulate those opportunities on a long-term basis to make sure that they continue to exist.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students of various genders, races, and cultural backgrounds gathered at an event hosted by the Harvard College Women’s Center, Queer Students and Allies, and BlackOut last night to discuss queer and ethnic communities and their shared status as marginalized identities in American society.
“It’s all about different perspectives, starting conversations, and talking about experiences to build partnerships,” said Adaora I. Asala, who facilitated the discussion and co-founded Queer Women of Color and Friends, a Boston social networking group.
Asala talked to attendees about ways for queer Harvard students of color to find support in the university community. Students expressed their frustration at how campus ethnic groups rarely address queer issues and how LGBT student groups often disregard questions of ethnicity, race, and culture.
“There are a lot of queer students who are afraid to express themselves on campus,” said Miguel Garcia ’12, “There has always been something missing in QSA, something that doesn’t allow me to reconcile my immigrant experience.”
Garcia said that he is interested in forming a support group for queer Latinos on campus, and Taj E. Tucker ’12 said that he hopes to collaborate with Garcia in reaching out to ethnic minorities.
“We’re trying to find a space where people of all different communities can be comfortable,” Tucker said.
Morgan L. Haven-Tietze ’10, a member of the Harvard Transgender Task Force, said that it is important for cultural groups to acknowledge queerness, and for LGBT groups to acknowledge ethnicity, in order to facilitate connections between marginalized identities.
Haven-Tietze said that starting conversations about intersecting communities can help individuals connect with other students facing similar questions of identity.
“It’s important to make spaces inclusive for whoever wants to be there,” Haven-Tietze said. “You don’t always get a chance at Harvard to hear what everyone has to say.”
Asala similarly said that creating an open space to discuss questions of intersecting identities would help queer women of color and their allies gain a stronger voice on campus and beyond.
“It’s a challenge to marry all of my different identities and keep them in one body—being Nigerian, being queer, being a woman in science, being a woman,” Asala said. “We want to create an avenue where people from all walks of life can bring their identities together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He would take the inbound pass and dribble the ball up the hardwood. When he crossed the half-court line, he’d call out a play using his free hand. Once he hit the three-point line, he would pass the ball off to one of his nearby teammates and get the offense moving. If the opponent double-teamed power forward Keith Wright or shooting guard Jeremy Lin, he would use that decision to his advantage, and he would find a way to get open. He would find his spot behind the three-point line, take a pass, aim, and fire. Swish.
All weekend long, Brandyn Curry was money.
The freshman point guard had the biggest weekend of his Harvard career last Friday and Saturday night as he torched Ivy rivals Brown and Yale for a total of 36 points despite just playing 26.5 minutes per game. He had only one turnover in each contest.
“I’m pleased with how I played,” Curry said. “I think I shot the ball well...[and] I think I did a good job running the offense and applying some defensive pressure.”
Curry, who also had 10 assists, seven steals, and five rebounds over the two-game stretch, earned his first Ivy League Rookie of the Week award for his performance. He became the third Harvard freshman to earn that honor this season, joining forwards Dee Giger—who won it once—and forward Kyle Casey, who has taken home the award four times.
“His shot’s on fire,” Casey said. “He’s been ready to shoot when the opportunity presents itself, and he’s been knocking them down.”
Curry shot 71% from the floor over the weekend, including an impressive 73% from three-point range.
His shot has gotten better and better as the season has progressed, and he attributes this success to simple hard work.
“During practice one of the things I like a lot is that we do a lot of shooting,” he said. “Coach Amaker always says ‘we knock down open shots.’ He’s always pushing us hard during shooting drills.”
Curry added that he plays assistant coach Kenny Blakeney in H-O-R-S-E almost every day, and that he works with assistant coach Brian DeStefano on his shot for a while after practice as well.
The results of this extra dedication have strongly paid off.
On Friday, he was unstoppable. Curry torched the Bears for a career-high 21 points, shooting 8-10 from the field and 4-5 from the three point line. He filled out the stat sheet with five assists, five steals, and four rebounds.
Curry kept up the scorching pace in the first half of Saturday night’s contest against the Bulldogs, scoring all 14 of his points in the first half and going 4-5 from behind the arc. Once the Crimson had built a big lead in the second half, Curry slowed things down, but he still finished with five assists and two steals as well.
“With young players...confidence is so key, and I think you see it in how he’s playing” said Crimson head coach Tommy Amaker. “He’s knocking down every open shot, he looks comfortable on the floor.”
Curry had previously been sharing time at the point guard spot with sophomore Oliver McNally, who had been the starter for much of the season. But coming off a two-game stretch in which Harvard suffered its only losing streak of the year, falling consecutively to Cornell and Princeton in early February, Amaker decided to make a switch.
He handed the team over to the freshman, and the Crimson have won six of seven ever since. During that time, Curry especially has excelled, increasing his 5.3-point average when coming off the bench to 11.6 points per game as a starter.
“I think it’s a coincidence,” said Curry of his improved play since being inserted into the starting lineup. “I’m a lot more confident with myself, with running the offense and playing in the system.”
It’s not just Curry’s offense that’s recently been receiving heavy praise.
“He definitely brings high intensity on the defensive end when he comes into the game,” Casey said. “He really gives us a good rhythm because of the pressure he puts on the opponent’s point guard, which disrupts their offense.”
Amaker said that it was Curry’s defense that earned him the starting role in the first place.
“I think he’s been able to do a tremendous job pressuring the ball,” the coach said.
The freshman has made such strides that he was chosen by Amaker to be the only non-senior starting on Senior Night against Yale.
But with great play also comes great responsibility. Since Amaker handed him the reigns to the team, Curry knows he now has to step up and be a leader—something not easy for any freshman.
“Sometimes when things are hard, we tend to defer to the seniors like Jeremy [Lin] and Doug [Miller],” he says. “I’m starting to become more comfortable, but I definitely think being more vocal as a leader of the team is an area I can improve in.”
Curry said he’s learned a lot from watching his teammates, especially Lin, the Cousy Award finalist for the nation’s best point guard.
“Just watching J, one thing I learned is he constantly makes plays for the team, he’s constantly finding open men” Curry explained. “Just being able to play with him every day and seeing the intensity and the enthusiasm he brings just makes you want to work hard.”
Curry also said he got a lot out of the competition for playing time with McNally, whose play also has improved once Curry started pushing him for time on the court.
“It’s been a good competition,” McNally said. “I think both of us have done some good things this year, and it’s definitely been a positive thing for the team and for us individually.”
The weekend was a special one not only for Curry but also for the entire squad. Harvard earned its 20th win of the 2009-2010 season against Yale, its most wins ever in a season.
And with Curry running the team for the next three years, it’s not too much of a stretch to foresee a string of winning seasons in the Crimson’s future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until last Friday, Colin West had his sights set on one thing: a rematch with Trinity’s Baset Chaudry, the nation’s top player and West’s longtime rival, in the finals of the College Squash Association Individual Championships.
West and Chaudry, both seniors, have played each other numerous times between intercollegiate competition and other tournaments, although West has yet to beat Chaudry in a CSA match.
“He’s been my main rival throughout college squash,” West says. “I’ve actually never beaten him in a match that’s counted, but its gotten closer.”
However, after Chaudry taunted a Yale player at the CSA National Team Championships in an incident that drew the attention of the national media, he announced Friday that he would not compete in the individual championships, leaving West as the likely No. 1 seed and tournament favorite.
The controversial incident occurred just after Chaudry had beaten Yale freshman Kenneth Chan to clinch the CSA National Team championship for Trinity, its twelfth in a row. Chaudry, who is a foot taller than Chan, screamed in his opponent’s face before leaving the court and slammed the door behind him trapping Chan inside.
Although the CSA was set to allow Chaudry to compete in the Individual National Championship, some speculate that Trinity College asked him to pull out of the tournament. Whatever the reason, West expressed disappointment that he won’t have the chance to face off against Chaudry in such an important match.
“I circled this on my calendar in July. I’ve been gearing up to play this guy for so long,” West laments. “This was going to be the biggest moment where I had a chance to beat him.”
Although West’s most formidable competition has withdrawn, he still faces a tough road on his quest to win his first individual national championship.
“It’s certainly not a walk in the park by any means,” West confesses. “I’m going to have a heck of a time winning it.”
With competition like Princeton’s No. 1 Todd Harrity and Trinity’s No. 2 Parth Sharma, likely the number two and three seeds in the tournament, it shouldn’t be hard for West to get excited about playing.
“By the time I get to the tournament I think there’s going to be a lot of nerves and a lot of adrenaline going there,” West says. “I don’t think it will be any damper on my performance and how much I’m looking forward to it.”
His coach, Satinder Bajwa, however, thinks that Chaudry’s withdrawal puts extra pressure on West.
“It makes it harder for Colin because now he has to prove that he’s the best player out there and should win it,” Bajwa says. “I know Colin would have loved to have played against [Chaudry] and won it with him in it.”
Whatever the result, West is looking forward to continuing his squash career after college, and hopefully getting paid to do what he loves.
“I think there’s something to be said for making a living off of your sport,” West says.
If West can quickly move up the ranks of the Professional Squash Association, he’ll be able to do just that. Most of the athletes in the top 100 of the world rankings are able to focus only on playing. Since West has already beaten some of those top 100 in PSA tournaments while at Harvard, he stands a good chance to succeed as a professional.
Bajwa, a former professional squash player himself, expects that West will be able to flourish in the pro circuit, but concedes that it might take some time before he’s able to rise to the top.
“Colin can adapt to the pro game, but he’ll have to give it a year before he can conquer the challenge that he’ll have,” Bajwa says.
Both Bajwa and West’s former coach, Jim Paton, recognize that West’s ability to adapt along with his willingness to train will continue to bring him success.
“He’s one of the most coachable guys I’ve ever worked with,” Paton says. “I’d say ‘lets try this drill,’ and he’d pick it up instantly and just want to keep doing it until he could do it perfectly.”
West admits that his motivation stems from the fact that he has total control over his performance.
“I like individual sports,” West reveals. “I like it being on me.”
He is able to feed off of the pressure and channel it, whether playing the 9th match when the Harvard team faces a 4-4 tie (where he has never lost) or the finals of the Canadian under-19 National Championship (which he won).
“He takes every match as a first match; he’s able to isolate what happened in the past,” Bajwa said. “He’s very good at being in the moment.”
If he can do just that, West should be well on his way to his first CSA Individual National Championship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Katey Stone already had a lot of hardware in her trophy case. But on Friday night, she added what might be the most impressive accomplishment yet.
When her No. 4 women’s hockey team soundly beat Princeton, 5-1, in the opening game of the ECAC quarterfinals, Stone earned her 338th career victory—pushing her past former Colby and Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson for the NCAA Division I coaching record.
“I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t important,” Stone said after the game. “I’m a very competitive person, I want to be the best. We have so many things we want to do, but I love the fact that I work at Harvard, with the highest academic standards in the country, and we can get it done [at] the hockey rink.”
Stone has been behind the Crimson bench for 16 years and boasts a .693 winning percentage (338-142-27) in her tenure. But what she has done for Harvard—turning it from a middle-of-the-road hockey team to a perennial national contender—speaks volumes about the respect she garners as a coach.
When Stone arrived before the 1994-95 season, she inherited a program that had spent most of its history hovering near .500. Four seasons later, the coach stood by as her team hoisted the 1999 AWCHA national championship—the culmination of a spectacular 33-1 season.
Since then, the Crimson has appeared in seven NCAA tournaments since the NCAA started sponsoring women’s hockey in 2001, making it to the championship game three times. Harvard’s won six ECAC regular-season titles and five tournament crowns. And the team hasn’t finished under .500 since 1997-98.
It helps, of course, that Stone has proven herself to be one of the top recruiters in the sport. Nine Olympians, including five who medaled last week in Vancouver, 21 All-Americans, and six Patty Kazmaier Award winners have skated for the Crimson in her tenure.
Three of those such stars—Kazmaier winners and Olympians AJ Mleczko ’98-’99, Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03, and Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04—anchored the 1999 championship squad.
“Something that I think she tells every player is they want kids who want to be here,” senior Randi Griffin said. “She doesn’t promise anyone anything… She tells you exactly what she wants you to do, and if you get the job done, she puts you out there. And I think everyone on this team has a lot of respect for her and confidence in her coaching. And that’s obviously big for her success too—I think every kid on this team really buys into what she’s doing.”
Those stars have led Harvard to some of its most momentous games, including three-straight appearances in the national championship game from 2003-05. But Stone’s talent isn’t limited to bringing good players to Cambridge—she takes good players and makes them great.
Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 is the poster child for Stone’s talent development. Cahow came into the program as a forward who struggled to find playing time as a freshman. Stone moved her back to the blue line midway through her first season, and a year and a half later, Cahow made the 2006 Olympic squad as a defenseman.
“There’s just something about Harvard,” junior Kate Buesser said. “There’s a high level of respect for everybody in the league, but [Stone] is here to push us as hard as we can go and make us better as a player. Coming into college, yeah, you’re all good players, you’re in D1 college, but the point is to get better over your four years, and that’s what she does with players here.”
The success of the Crimson team this year can largely be attributed to Stone’s coaching as well. The task of redeveloping an offense that had graduated its three top scorers was daunting enough, but throw in injuries to key contributors like junior Liza Ryabkina and senior Christina Kessler, and you have a recipe for a season that could have ended in disaster.
Instead, Harvard sits ranked fourth nationally and, with a good performance in the late rounds of the ECAC Tournament this weekend, is in position to host the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
“That’s where the discipline comes into play,” Stone said. “We’re not out here screaming and yelling at our kids—our kids are very self motivated.”
“We’re just trying to make our kids better and stay on those things, and at the same time have them be so excited to come down to the rink every day,” she added. “And I think that’s amazing. They have a blast together, they’re dying to get here every day, and to me, that’s huge.”
It’s clear that Stone, a three-time ECAC Coach of the Year, is widely respected throughout the sport. She was one of three candidates to coach the US women’s Olympic squad in Vancouver and has experience coaching a variety of national teams, from the U-18 squad on up.
Although Stone was ultimately passed over for the Olympic job, it’s clear that she has a passion for the sport as a whole—not just the success of the Harvard program.
“I think there’s been a lot recently on the big divide in women’s hockey, because you get the U.S. and Canada, and then they feel that everybody else is sort of dragging behind,” she said. “Finland, China, Russia, four years ago were not playing that kind of hockey. They just weren’t… And you look at the college game, you look at how competitive it is—three years ago it wasn’t like that. There were plenty of days you could think, ‘Oh, it’s probably going to be okay tonight.’ You can’t go into a game anymore that way.”
There’s no question that Stone is responsible for some of that progress. But for the coach, personal accomplishments have always been the icing on the cake of her team’s success. Her Crimson takes on No. 6 Clarkson in Potsdam, N.Y. on Friday as it continues its march towards that elusive NCAA championship.
“To have all the kids and coaches and administrators [here]—you don’t do this by yourself,” Stone said. “And if it weren’t for their support, it would never happen. But this is for all the kids who played for me and listened to me rant and rave every once in a while. And it’s just, I said to [the team], I was happy that they were all here to be a part of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a long road from the 28th round in the MLB Draft to a roster spot on a Major League Team, but former Harvard player Steffan Wilson '08 may have a chance to complete the journey this season. Wilson was added yesterday to the spring training roster for the Milwaukee Brewers, where he was called up to back MLB star Prince Fielder.
It was a big jump for Wilson, who spent last year playing in the Class A Advanced or “A+” league for the Brevard County, part of the Brewers’ farm system. He batted .272 with 13 home runs, 15 doubles, and 60 RBIs.
Wilson played baseball for the Crimson for three years before leaving Cambridge a year early to pursue his baseball dreams. Some regarded it as a bad move given that his junior year performance failed to match preseason expectations, but the first baseman couldn’t turn down a shot at his childhood dream of making the Big Leagues even if it meant leaving Harvard coach Joe Walsh and Harvard baseball behind. General manager Doug Melvin say his primarily role will be to allow Fielder to get some rest time in drills, a comment not surprisingly left off the GoCrimson update.
So while it remains unlikely that 2010 will be the magic year for Wilson to play in a regular season game, membership on the Spring Training roster means that he can always say he was on a major league baseball team even if it was just for spring training.
And he can always follow the lead of Brian Scalabrine, speaking here on not playing during the Celtics 2008 Title Run:
“Maybe now you could say I didn't play a second, but in five years, you guys are going to forget. In ten years I'll still be a champion. In 20 years I'll tell my kids I probably started, and in 30 years I'll probably tell them I got the MVP. So I'm probably not too worried about it.”
A Crimson article on Steffan Wilson from the 2007 season can be found here.

So you lost your dorm key again and got a new one made, only to stick your foot in your boot a couple days later and find—what’s this?—the original culprit. What should you do with the extra? Give it to the Harvard Office of Sustainability, which already has raised $75 in that program we told you about back in January.
The initiative to collect keys to donate to Key for Hope, a Massachusetts charity, was a “huge success” according to the Office’s Web site. Over 2,000 keys were collected from departments and individuals across campus. Recycling the keys and selling the scrap metal resulted in a profit of $75, which was donated to local food pantries.
Because of the success of the program, the Office of Sustainability will now be accepting donations year-round. You can send donations by University mail to 46 Blackstone St. It’s time to get keyed up!

A $10 bill could get you a burrito from Felipe’s and a Bud Light, but the Senior Gift Committee wants you to donate it to Harvard.
With its new 32-second YouTube video, the Senior Gift Committee has begun the yearly effort to convince seniors to give to Harvard. But looking at the video, we think that Hamilton could have been better spent on increasing the teaser’s production values.
As it begins, the camera pans from an empty suite and unreasonably clean bathrooms, only to conclude both ambiguously and ominously with the date "3.8.10." While we know to fear the year 2012, when the world will come to an end, we weren’t sure what we're supposed to feel about this coming Monday is (a plague wipes out Harvard leaving it empty and in pristine condition?!).
In search of answers we spoke to Class of 2010 Senior Gift Committee Co-Chair Mary K.B. Cox ’10. She said the video is supposed to be “cryptic”—a teaser for a follow-up video on Mar. 8. We guess we’re supposed to anxiously await the fate of fair Harvard until then.
We're not so sure, though, about this whole “mystery” tactic. Somehow, empty classrooms don't seem to be that terrifying. The university could probably use the extra space to construct labs or make some more residential housing.
Last year, the Senior Gift Committee released a video parodying the “Don’t Vote” campaign. We didn’t think too much of that one either. But we look forward to this year's full-length video. If you think you can decode this cryptic teaser, feel free to leave a prediction about the next one in the comments.
