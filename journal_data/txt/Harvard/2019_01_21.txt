After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It is different on this side,” the ghost of Birchwood Manor explains. Although the ghost’s past is mysterious, the ultimate shortcoming of Kate Morton’s newest novel, “The Clockmaker’s Daughter,” is its inability to effectively tie together its many plotlines. So many different perspectives are given — all very tenuously and too conveniently connected — that by the end of the novel, it is quite unclear who or what this novel is truly about, and nothing feels resolved.
The beginning of the novel focuses on Elodie, a historian and daughter of a great musician mother who passed years ago, as she prepares for her wedding to a man she doesn’t seem to love. When she finds a satchel at the archive of Joseph Stratton containing the photograph of a woman and a sketchbook, she is unnaturally captivated by the objects in the satchel. Elodie insists to her friends and family that the house in one of the sketches is the same house from a story her mother used to tell her — citing a weather vane — and this leads her to feel a connection to the sketch and the photograph that Elodie realizes makes her “frankly, a bit unhinged.” This weak connection of a weather vane and a children’s tale is apparently enough to launch an investigation, which in the beginning the reader knows is somehow tangentially related to the mysterious ghost of Birchwood Manor, whose father is a clockmaker.
While the strong feeling Elodie has is convenient to the plot, unfortunately it doesn’t create enough motivation for the reader to care about the house or its specific history. Suddenly, Morton drops Elodie’s plotline for over 100 pages of flashbacks to various years that explain the history of those who lived in the house and the mystery of the ghost who lives there. Morton has added unnecessary chapters to detail the entire life story of minor characters. The connections between the many plotlines often don’t make much sense until the end, which makes reading chapter after chapter of these characters seem pointless. Then, suddenly, everything is tied neatly together, all too conveniently as characters act on “flash[es] of certainty” that are so unexplainable that they “might actually have been a symptom of madness.” The connections rely so heavily on actions made by characters whose motivations are so unidentifiable, they can only be explained away as a feeling or a crazy impulse.
Although Morton’s writing is largely strong and enjoyable, the prose used for the ghost’s sections is odd, to say the least. The ghost is prone to using over-the-top dramatic language that feels forced and out of place. “My birds are coming home to roost,” the ghost proclaims as the secrets begin to reveal themselves, “and I feel myself being drawn inexorably towards the nexus of my story. It all happens so quickly from here.” Morton even ends the novel on the ghost’s weird language, spewing nonsense such as “I am the chimney pot and the black snacking drainpipe” and other such odd “I am” statements. It is one thing to ask your readers to suspend disbelief in a historical fiction novel and allow ghosts. It is another to make that ghost speak so annoyingly.
Perhaps the most maddening aspect of this novel is the way Elodie’s plotline appears to be the frame of this story — after all, it is her discovery of the sketch and photograph that, in its forced way, propels us to be interested in the history of the ghost of Birchwood Manor — yet Morton abandons it so suddenly. Elodie doesn’t have her own chapter for most of the middle of the novel and only appears briefly at the end. She uncovers secrets of her past and reveals her lack of feelings for her fiancé, yet she only makes vague future plans to talk to her father and fiancé. By the end of the novel, it is clear Elodie’s sole purpose in the narrative is to create an excuse for Morton to tell the story of the ghost of Birchwood Manor. With so much promise, “The Clockmaker’s Daughter” failed to live up to expectations, instead delivering a story that was not worth the time to read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 22, 2019 at 8:01 p.m.
Local activists and at least one public official are calling on Harvard to remove the Sackler family’s name from its buildings after a memorandum filed in federal court Tuesday alleged the family knowingly understated the risks of its company’s addictive opioid product.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 submitted the 274-page court filing as part of a lawsuit the state brought against Purdue Pharma — the Connecticut-based pharmaceutical company that produces the painkiller OxyContin — in June 2018. The filings allege that members of the Sackler family, who have served on the company’s board of directors, “controlled Purdue’s misconduct” all the while raking in billions of dollars from opioid sales.
The Sackler family has donated significant sums to Harvard and helped fund the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, which holds the University’s collection of Asian, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean art.
For years, members of the Sackler family have sought to distance themselves from Purdue and its addictive narcotic, which many have blamed for its role in spurring the opioid crisis. In 2017, 47,600 Americans died from opioid-related overdoses, a rate of roughly 14.9 per 100,000, over five times higher than in 1999.
But this week’s filing sheds new light on the extent to which multiple members of the family remained involved in the company and its efforts to deceive the public about the risks associated with OxyContin, even after they agreed to a Justice Department settlement in 2007.
Though Arthur Sackler passed away nearly a decade before OxyContin came to market, many activists blame him for pioneering the aggressive marketing techniques that Purdue and other pharmaceutical giants would later employ to sell their addictive painkillers.
Indeed, those very tactics — using throngs of sales representatives to promote opioids directly to doctors, nurses, and pharmacists — targeted Cambridge and surrounding communities in the years before the region saw a spike in overdose deaths, according to this week’s legal filing.
Robert Josephson, a Purdue spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that the company is “committed” to working with victims of the opioid crisis. He cited educational initiatives the company has funded to warn teenagers about the dangers of opioids, as well as Purdue’s collaboration with law enforcement and its funding of state prescription drug monitoring programs.
Jillian Sackler, the widow of Arthur M. Sackler, wrote in an emailed statement that Arthur M. Sackler had "nothing to do with" the opioid crisis.
"It is a gross injustice to connect Arthur to the opioid crisis some 30 years after his death when he had nothing to do with it. It denies the many important contributions he made working to improve world health and to build cultural bridges between peoples," she wrote.
In the wake of the most recent filing, Somerville mayor Joseph A. Curtatone, a 2011 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, urged Harvard and Tufts University to remove the Sackler name from their campuses in a Thursday tweet.
“As a @Harvard graduate and Mayor of a city that’s home to @TuftsUniversity, I think there needs to be a serious discussion about removing the Sackler name from those campuses given the revelations coming from @MassAGO about how #OxyContin was pushed in our state,” he wrote.
Activists also circulated an online petition calling on Harvard to “Cut Ties” with the “Makers of OxyContin.” The petition has garnered more than 250 signatures and will be delivered to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, according to the petition’s webpage.
Harvard spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the calls for the University to strip the Sackler name from its campus.
Also on Thursday, dozens of organizations dedicated to fighting the opioid epidemic, including Facing Addiction and Magnolia New Beginnings, gathered in Boston to discuss the ongoing legal cases against pharmaceutical companies and how to pressure these companies through activism.
Domenic Esposito, who organized the event — called the Opioid Epidemic Accountability Conference — said in an interview he hopes Harvard will strongly consider removing Arthur Sackler’s name from its campus.
“I personally think they should be reconsidering their…donor lists, especially when it comes to the Sacklers,” he said.
Esposito acknowledged that universities face a “tough” decision in evaluating whether to strip a donor’s name completely from their institutions.
“It’s a slippery slope because then could it be someone who is associated with Big Oil, and I mean, where do you draw the line?” Esposito said.
The recent public outcry is not the first time Harvard has faced criticism for its connection to the Sackler family. Last June, more than 30 demonstrators held a “die-in” at the Sackler Museum to protest the Sackler’s connections to Harvard. Photographer Nan Goldin, whose works are displayed at the museum, led the June protest and has also previously launched a Twitter campaign to encourage the University to cut its ties with the Sackler family.
CORRECTION: Jan. 22, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that a spokesperson for Jillian Sackler did not respond to a request for comment. In fact, due to an incorrect email address, the spokesperson never received The Crimson's request for comment. This article has been updated to include Jillian Sackler's comment.
