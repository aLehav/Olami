What makes a life worth living? Halfway between theological scholarship and self-help, “Life Worth Living” was inspired by a popular seminar taught by Yale professors Miroslav Volf, Matthew Croasmun, and Ryan McAnnally-Linz, who co-authored the book. Their work aims to examine what its writers call “the Question” — a term that they leave open-ended. In fact, they contend, the Question’s breadth and multidimensionality signify different things to different people during specific times in their lives.
What unites individuals in pursuit of the Question, the professors contend, is their shared will to examine how they might live fuller, more intentioned lives. It is a lofty charge complicated by the thorny forces that have come to characterize our collective moment — social media, rising political acrimony, globalization, and the explosive proliferation of powerful technologies, to name just a few. This self-exploration is not restricted to academics and scholars, but to all who crave a more sustainable way of pursuing fulfillment and growth.
Indeed, the professors all but anticipate the eye rolls and head scratches that may result from the heady language of “the Question,” as well as the slew of historical and religious figures they cite throughout their nearly 300-page journey. They engage the ambitious scale of their work without alienating readers by meeting their skepticism with humility and pragmatism. Through guiding questions and a consistently conversational tone, the professors keep their feet planted on the ground as they grasp at conceptual ideas.
“The goal isn’t to finish thinking about the Question,” they write in the book’s early pages. “The truly important thing is to get started. Let’s do that.”
The book lives up to its fullest potential when using historical and spiritual insights to penetrate into the core dynamics of today’s global culture. One such example is a discussion of Silicon Valley, a paragon of growth and development that the professors use to exhibit a cultural blockage. Most individuals in the Valley, they contend, regard effectiveness as the most profound question to be answered. They argue that although this may not be the most discerning question for all people, it’s realistically the most deeply felt question that the Valley’s residents and “many of us know how to answer.”
Herein lies the professors’ critical point: Society often prioritizes optimizing productivity without considering its long-term ethics. That ethical consideration is naturally complex, and the definitions of “good” or “right” will likely differ for every person.
“Many spend their entire lives climbing a ladder only to realize that the ladder has been leaning against the wrong wall,” the professors write.
The professors then arrive at what for many may seem like an oxymoronic revelation, particularly amidst our current era’s individualistic and materialistic culture: The deepest mode of relation to the world is not one that centers the self, but rather decenters the self to make room for others. The most sustainable and satisfying ways of living, then, are deeply relational.
The strength of the book’s structure, however, is also its greatest liability. Because “Life Worth Living” aims to traverse so much material in a compressed space, the text at times provides the contours of ideas at the expense of interrogating their nuances. One example of this occurs when the professors discuss the dueling allures of uninhibited self-expression and societal conformity. (Of course, even the establishment of these ideas as binaristic may seem to many readers overly simplistic).
Foregrounding their discussion through musings from Oscar Wilde, they write: “Pushed and pulled by these pressures, you get yourself completely wrong. You give in. You sell out. You conform.” Absent from the passage is an examination of complicating factors that may compel an individual, despite their individual instinct, to take the well-trodden path. After all, pursuing what one truly “wants” to do is easier for individuals with the material means to do so.
The existential questions posed in “Life Worth Living” seem all the more urgent in light of the seismic technological developments that have dominated recent headlines, one of which is ChatGPT, the viral chatbot from the Silicon Valley giant OpenAI. Poised to disrupt a slew of knowledge industries, the tool is consequential for its presentation of a deeper unease: What does it mean to be human in a world in which technology usurps human capability? It’s tempting to glean a direct answer for this question through the historical wisdom of Aristotle, Jesus, or Confucius, but the professors of this book present no easy answers. The very act of approaching this question with integrity and diligence, they seem to suggest, is part of the answer itself.

In 1956, urban planner Lúcio Costa, embarked on a daunting task alongside Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. They were entrusted to plan, design, and lead the construction of a brand new capital city for South America’s largest nation from scratch. Under the initiative of Brazil’s then-president Juscelino Kubitschek and his “Fifty Years in Five” program — which aimed to catalyze 50 years of progress and development for the country in only five — the two set out to realize a massive vision that would, in the hopes of its organizers, allow Brazil to forge a new, modern identity in the latter half of the century.
Although the city has continued to expand since its formal inauguration in 1960, those embryonic years and the sentiments surrounding them are a fascinating case study of human responses to the possibilities of the future. Fortunately, armed with a camera and profound ability to discern the sentiments of his time, the iconic Swiss photographer René Burri created pictures of the time which are both subtle artistic masterclasses and emotional time capsules.
The most prominent feature of Burri’s photos in Brasília is the clear use of distinct angles of elevation. Although photographers often vary the angles from which they take photos for individual images, it is rare that an entire project exhibits such a strong directionality in this regard. What this means is that with very few exceptions, there is a significant positive or negative angle of elevation between the camera and the subject of the image. Although this angle is primarily upward-facing — a technique Burri achieved by shooting close to the ground — there is also a collection of aerial images within the project that are unique in that they are both downward facing and, unlike all other images, in color.
Burri’s style of picturing the relationship between people and their inhabited (or soon to be) environments is in sharp contrast to that of many other photographers’, most notably Nadav Kander’s, largely because of their differing messages, indicating photography’s often greater power of artistic expression than informative and objective documentation. Highlighting displacement and feelings of loss along China’s Yangtze River, Kander photographed scenes such that people appeared small alongside large infrastructure creations: Burry did precisely the opposite. Throughout his series of images in Brasília, the Swiss photographer elevates people alongside the important buildings that constituted Brazil’s new capital city. In the images, these people are often the subjects, making the new capital the background. Moreover, given Burri’s frequently employed upward-facing angle, the people in his images are sometimes physically larger in the foreground than the buildings behind them. Thus, rather than portraying people as controlled by forces beyond their control, as Kander did, Burri’s images empower people in the pursuit of new frontiers and ideas, looking not only outward but, more importantly, upward.
However, with uncharted territory comes feelings of the inevitable unknown. As such, there is often a resounding emptiness throughout Burri’s images. This emptiness emanates not only from the wide and open swaths of unused land yet to be constructed on, but also from Burri’s unique use of the sky. In several of the project’s images, the sky occupies well more than half of the entire photo, a technique that, employed by an amateur, would make many photography teachers scoff. This perception is because, broadly, the sky in photography is considered to be “wasted space” that could be used to emphasize other compositional elements instead. Unless the sky is the subject of the image, as in the case of a photo of a sunset, for example, it typically looks similar in every photo and thus adds little value. Nevertheless, the sky is utterly essential to the cumulative power of Burri’s interpretation of Brasília at the time because it helps depict the new city with an aura of both boundless possibility and uncertainty.
Although Brasília was the new capital city being watched by curious global observers in the mid-20th century, similar phenomena are occurring today on entirely different continents. Due to concerns such as overcrowding and pollution, the governments of both Egypt and Indonesia have begun construction on new, entirely purpose-built capital cities. And although these new cities are bound to be unique in their own important ways, the curious observer can find a potential window into the minds of both their creators and first inhabitants in Burri’s work.

While Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are forever recognized as a dynamic Boston duo for their 1997 Oscar-winning film “Good Will Hunting,” their newest picture “Air” — a story of Michael Jordan’s 1984 partnership with Nike — evokes similar charm from opening to closing credits.
The film centers on Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a bold sports marketing executive looking for a star for Nike’s basketball division. Vaccaro is assigned this crucial task by Nike’s CEO and co-founder Phil Knight, played by the film’s director Affleck. The two find themselves arguing over budget cuts, Nike’s changing culture, and the best strategy to secure an elite athlete for the brand.
To the audience’s surprise, Jordan was initially unamused by Nike’s shoes and wanted to sign with Converse or Adidas, creating a daunting challenge for Vaccaro. The film follows Vaccaro's subsequent bargaining with Jordan’s ruthless agent David Falk (Chris Messina), his mother Deloris Jordan (Viola Davis), and Nike’s head marketing executive Rob Strasser (Jason Batemen). When everyone else was convinced that Jordan would never be a Nike athlete, Vaccaro’s nearly clairvoyant desire to sign him ultimately took the corporation to new heights.
Despite Affleck’s experience directing dramas — such as “The Town,” “Live by Night,” “Gone Baby Gone,” and Oscars Best Picture winning “Argo” — he successfully transitioned into the comedic and fast-paced style needed for “Air.” Bringing in Bateman’s comedic talents, Marlon Wayans as iconic coach George Raveling, and comedic legend Chris Tucker as Nike exec Howard “H” White, Affleck assembled a cast that supports the simultaneously inspiring and hilarious tone of the Jordan origin story.
Today, Nike is very much a global brand, but “Air” provides a spirited and novel look into its Portland origins. The film is organized by Nike’s guiding principles, which appear on screen at every turning point and lean into the nostalgia of the ’80s. The audience already knows that Jordan becomes one of the most famous athletes of all time, but to see the Nike team doubt his abilities creates comedy and tension that push the film forward.
In the film, Vaccaro and the Nike marketing team have to choose athletes from the ’84 draft class that they hope to sign, and their determining legendary players like Charles Barkley and John Stockton as irrelevant is downright comedic. Between scenes, the film uses ’80s hits from Run DMC, Grandmaster Flash and Cyndi Lauper, taking viewers back to the good ol’ days. There are times where the song choices feel gratuitous for its exorbitant budget, but the music is often complemented by the vintage technology, costumes, and set designs that create an unblemished ’80s feel.
What makes “Air” move past its good qualities into a future classic sports film is the performance of Viola Davis as Dolores Jordan. From the moment Dolores Jordan meets Vaccaro to the final phone call where they seal the deal, Davis’s stellar abilities — as betrayed by her EGOT status — always leads to a commanding and moving performance. Michael Jordan’s only rule for the film was that Davis play his mother, and he made an outstanding choice that uplifts not only the marketability of the film, but its quality. While the film is witty and feel good, Davis’s abilities take the film to another level.
Jordan’s deal with Nike revolutionized sports endorsement models because of Dolores’s insistence that he receive a percentage of all revenue for any Jordan shoe. Dolores beautifully describes the ethos of the film in her final monologue, in which she says, “A shoe is just a shoe until my son steps in it.”
The film relies heavily, of course, on the iconography of Jordan, but makes the clever artistic choice to not show his face. Not only does the mystery keep audiences on the edge of their seats waiting to see Jordan, but allows them to stay engaged in the story. There can only be one Jordan, and it would be impossible to feel that sense of immersion with an actor in his place.
The infamous Air Jordan 1, created by Peter Moore (Matthew Maher) has transformed the world of basketball and defined the sneaker culture of today’s world. “Air” brings together the people that turned Jordan into an American story of belief, perseverance, and most importantly, swag.

On March 26, the Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF) premiered its short film program titled “Survival is Insufficient.” The eight films included in the showcase — all between eight and 17 minutes long — were unrelated in content, but all centered around living with personal demons. Whether these demons were literal or metaphorical, the underlying goal of each film was to defeat them.
The curators for the screening, Melinda Green, George Luke, and Kevin Monahan grouped these particular short films together based on the characters’ common goals. In the description of the event on the BUFF website, the curators state that the protagonists of each film “desperately need to be seen, heard, and understood by another person.” For instance, in director’s Ellie Stewart’s “Pool Party,” a teenage girl is isolated from her friends because they suspect she is a mermaid and when she finally reveals her secret to her biggest enemy, the protagonist takes revenge on her like an evil Siren would.
Each film sat somewhere within the science-fiction genre. While some included random absurdities in the mundane lives of characters, others were completely based in alternate universes. “It Takes a Village” from Glam Hag is a whacky take on “Rosemary’s Baby” where a lady cult supports a pregnant woman through an untraditional birth. In a secret meeting place filled with feminist paraphernalia, glittered walls, and masked women, the idea of birth as a monument for heterosexual couples is turned on its head with the women-only cast.
Other films touched more explicitly on issues of today. Director Tito Fernandes’s “Incubus” deals with the trauma of sexual assault as the wound reincarnates itself as a monster inside the protagonist’s body.
On the more lighthearted side, “CONTENT: The Lo-Fi Man” from directors Brian Lonano and Blake Meyers shows the vapidness of today’s “content creator.” A demanding robot sucks the creativity out of filmmakers and turns them into insipid content creators, and the main protagonist must look to his favorite film hero for inspiration to take down this “Content Seeker.” It was like “Star Wars” if Luke Skywalker was a passionate film critic.
Some films were purely for comedic relief, and there seemed to be no deeper meaning to their plots. “Rhyme or Die” from Max Lincoln was exactly what the title says: The characters competed in rhyming battles where the losers died. Similarly, Francisco Lacerda’s film “They Call It…Red Cemetary!” had little to offer its audience besides a laugh at its ridiculousness: two greedy cowboys put themselves through miserable tasks just to get their hands on some gold coins. Full of gimmicky jokes and unimpressive filming techniques, these were the least impactful films out of the eight.
Although none of the films came away with an award at this year's festival, there were a couple that shined for their funny storylines or impressive special effects. “Scooter” from Chelsea Lupkin was a hilarious short where a post-breakup heroine saves the world from horrible men. With the help of a supernatural demon-woman, the protagonist avoids a misogynistic catastrophe. Frederik S. Hana’s “From.Beyond,” by contrast, is a more serious short about the possibilities of human and alien relationships. Its documentary style makes the footage of extraterrestrial creatures seem realistic.
After watching the entire program, Lupkin’s “Scooter” remains the most stand-out. Although it was entirely shot outside a fast-food stand, so much occurs during its eight minutes that it is able to balance both tension and thrill with a cathartic ending. The characters’ personalities really shine through, as they are obviously inspired by the people many encountered in our day-to-day lives.
“Survival is Insufficient” brought many fresh ideas to BUFF this year. Whether it is mermaids or fatal rhyming competitions, the audience members left prepared for whatever may manifest in this lifetime or another world.

Over the last three decades, Quentin Tarantino has cemented himself as one of the most influential writer-directors to grace the silver screen with his unique stories and vast filmic knowledge. In 1992, he burst onto the Hollywood scene with “Reservoir Dogs,” a bottle crime drama that established many of his signature filmmaking elements. From nonlinear storytelling and graphic violence to snappy dialogue and pop culture references galore, “Reservoir Dogs” had all the trappings of an auteur in the making. From there, Tarantino would go on to make such classics as “Pulp Fiction,” “Jackie Brown,” and “Kill Bill Volume 1” and “Volume 2.” Even his lesser known writing credits, like “From Dusk Till Dawn” and “True Romance,” had the power to become cult classics under directors other than himself.
But Quentin Tarantino’s cinematic reign may be coming to an end. His 10th film, “The Movie Critic,” has been pronounced his swan song even before release, an epilogue to an impressive oeuvre that ranges from postmodern romance to grindhouse horror. It will be set in 1970s Los Angeles and follow a female lead (Tarantino’s first since “Kill Bill”). At first, this plot was rumored to be based on the life of famed movie critic Pauline Kael during her tenure as a Paramount consultant who would be played by Tarantino darling Margot Robbie. However, this rumor was soon dispelled by the director at a Q and A event in Paris. In addition, it has been revealed that “Tár” phenom Cate Blanchett is pegged for a possible starring role.
This begs the question: Should Tarantino hang up the towel? Is it time for the now sixty-year-old director to say goodbye to the medium that has inspired him since youth?
The answer, though hard to accept, is yes.
The celebrity director is approaching the point in his career that will define the way he is perceived for years to come. His recent movies, including “The Hateful Eight” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” are less trailblazing and more indulgent as compared to his earlier works. If this cycle were to continue, Tarantino might jeopardize his legacy as one of the best to translate thought to paper to big-budget film.
Tarantino has cited countless other directors as his basis for quitting while he is ahead. Alfred Hitchcock, after releasing “The Birds” in 1963, directed very few features that compared to his more lauded earlier work. Similarly, Brian De Palma, one of Tarantino’s biggest influences (and a notorious Hitchcock analog), stopped producing films of the same youthful vitality of his 1970s and 1980s classics as he entered his elder years.
In an interview with CNN’s Chris Wallace, Tarantino said, “I don't want to become this old man who's out of touch, when already I'm feeling a bit like an old man out of touch when it comes to the current movies that are out right now. And that's what happens.” With that quote, the famed director hits the proverbial nail smack-dab on the head. It is rare that a creator or artist realizes they are running out of steam, but Tarantino outwardly and accurately addresses this phenomenon each time he is criticized for his tenth film being his last.
“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” Tarantino’s most recent movie, is evidence of his theory of diminishment. While masterfully produced and directed, it shows signs of Tarantino’s decline as a storyteller. Whereas his most notable movies rip from and embellish upon his favorite scenes and stories from the past, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” tries to analyze the TV and film industries behind the creation of his favorite content — but his attempt ultimately falls short.
Though Tarantino professed “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” to be his “best movie” on the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” the director could not be further from the truth. Aside from a darkly comedic climax and top-of-the-line production value (a luxury afforded by Tarantino now being a household name), the narrative of “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” much like its predecessor “The Hateful Eight,” drags far more than the director’s more esteemed works. In recent years, Tarantino has become overly complacent with himself, truly “an old man out of touch.”
Like “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “The Movie Critic” takes a meta approach to storytelling. Rather than the production of film, it derives its narrative from film’s reception (which Tarantino has rejected since his first grim and gory feature). These two films show signs of Tarantino’s fall from grace, in which his “write what you know” screenwriting philosophy has culminated in films that explicitly depict his two passions — filmmaking and the criticism thereof. As Tarantino strays away from genre films and toward more meta, self-aware features, this form of storytelling turns his greatest assets into faults. His verbose and witty dialogue becomes too verbose and underwhelmingly witty. His penchant for violence and tension is sidestepped for nostalgia and exposition. In short, Tarantino becomes a parody of himself.
And while “The Movie Critic” is his final feature film, Tarantino will be anything but removed from the public sphere. On multiple occasions, Tarantino has asserted that he will write film criticisms, novels, and plays while in retirement. Instead of transplanting his passions into film, Tarantino will find other venues better suited to what he finds most artistically fascinating. His two books, a novelization of “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and an exploration of 1970s films called “Cinema Speculation,” as well as his cineaste-geared podcast “The Video Archives,” are prime examples of future Tarantino content. Moreover, an eight episode television series written and directed by the acclaimed director is slated to shoot this year.
Though his prolific filmmaking career will be coming to a warranted conclusion, Quentin Tarantino will have the chance to reinvent and prove his artistry in domains that he has yet to conquer.

Ever wanted to hear Kiera Knightley speak with a deliberately faint Boston accent? Well then, the “Boston Strangler,” released this March, is the film for you.
The “Boston Strangler” is based on the true story of the murders of 13 Bostonian women in the early 1960s. The film follows Loretta McLaughlin (Kiera Knightley), a reporter for the “Record American,” and her co-writer Jean Cole (Carrie Coon) as they seek to investigate the killings alongside a rattled police force. The pursuit is not made easy by numerous dead ends, institutional ineptitude, and tense home lives. All in all, the film does an effective job of capturing and retaining audience interest through unexpected twists and turns. “Boston Strangler” presents more than a simple murder mystery; instead, the film takes a glean into the struggles of ambitious women in the workplace and the uncertainty of justice, orchestrated into a nuanced, truthful ending.
“Boston Strangler”’s director, Matt Ruskin, is no stranger to the genre, with past crime drama films such as “Crown Heights” and “Booster.” Ruskin’s experience shines through his cinematic choices such as adept pacing and deft shots by cinematographer Ben Kutchins. Murderous acts of the killer are displayed with abrupt shots to emphasize his mystique and danger, a longer shot tracks the movement of Loretta in the newsroom to center her in her environment while capturing her bustling atmosphere. These techniques effectively rope the audience into the world of these characters as viewers become invested in their stories.
The primarily green-blue color palette of the film coupled with its conservative use of lighting establishes the ominous mood of the solemn subject matter; however, it can become overwhelming for audience members as it remains prominent throughout the film. Nevertheless, the cool color scheme effectively brings out the warmer tones of light throughout the film, from the gentle blooms of reporter flash cameras to the yellow-tinted shine on faces, reflecting the light of house lamps. The lighting similarly plays an instrumental role in smaller plot lines, such as its illustration of the dwindling vitality of Loretta’s domestic life and relationships. The opening scene of her family sitting together at the kitchen table — the warmth of the sun shining through — resembles nothing of the final view of her home, dark from the outside save for the bright flashes of the TV through the curtain that her husband watches, alone. This method of storytelling is subtle, yet effective, as the true weight of the shift — gradual throughout the movie — registers holistically for the audience by the film’s close.
The authenticity of the time period is represented by shots of whirling ink rollers or the low rumble of a black 1950s Mercury Monterey. The characters come to life through minor changes in body language. While Kiera Knightley may not say anything as she examines an autopsy file, her chest rises, her jaw tightens, and she rests her head on her fingertips. These details may not seem significant, but they add to the overall narrative and sophisticated mood of the film.
The film provides an insightful look into the diversity of attitudes and approaches to the strenuous, commonplace incidents of gender discrimination through the contrasting characters of Jean and Loretta. When faced with workplace discrimination, menacing calls, and a job that keeps one from home, Jean is calm and calculated where Loretta is agitated and impassioned. “Let ‘em sell their papers,” Jean says to Loretta as she is enraged by the newspaper’s circulation stunt of printing their portraits — in an attempt to generate intrigue with female reporters — “you still got the biggest story in the city.” While these two women often pick different battles, the ultimate display of feminist solidarity is in their collaboration and mutual respect for each other, as they realize they can both learn from one another.
Embedded, too, is a critique of law enforcement structures, which Loretta publishes as murders stack up and the Boston Police Department still refuses to share information with other police forces, missing potential connections. While she comes to empathize with their position through collaboration with Detective James Conley (Alessandro Nivola), her criticism also speaks to the reluctance of news outlets to condemn the police, a persistent apathy toward violence against women, and a society all too ready to capitalize on tragedy.
“Boston Strangler” has the power to enthrall audiences with gorgeous cinematography and emotive performances. Ultimately, the movie is meaningful for its acknowledgment of the women who fight to exist and serve societies that diminish them and their work — those who are as much victims of the systems of justice which failed them as they are of any murderer.

Antibes. 1965.
Mornings in Antibes start early. The sea winds that roll through the narrow streets of the old French town warm quickly under the heavy sun. The growing light sinks into the chipped stone houses and their earthen rooftops, warming with the day. Big-bellied pots, also terracotta, host blooms of Indian laurels, hyacinths, and lemon trees and line the narrow streets; the leaves rustle in the fragrant winds.
An old church sits on the sea’s edge.
Lapping waves caress the tall seawall.
Dried salt collects on the windows of the old town.
Chef Eric Ripert was born in Antibes, though he now lives and works almost 4000 miles away from the old sea town. New York City – the condensed island of concrete that stretches toward the same yellow sun – is very different from the south of France, and it’s also where Ripert’s restaurant, Le Bernardin, made its mark.
On the back wall of Le Bernardin’s dining room hangs a large panel depicting a dark, foamy, moving sea. Not the same pale blue waves that crash into old Antibes, but ocean waves; grayed-green swells that hint to the treasures that live beneath; a world out of our reach. A large wavy sculptural installment – alluding to seaweed – adorns another wall.
Other than hosting these subtle reminders of the other world, Le Bernardin resembles a classically Western fine-dining establishment: carpeted floors, low leather chairs, tall ceilings, white tablecloths; reminders of the past, perhaps, though this restaurant seems to exist outside of the normal standards of time and space.
“We are — first of all — a seafood restaurant.”
At Le Bernardin, “the fish is the star of the plate,” said Ripert in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
And he’s not exaggerating either. Every component, according to Ripert – whether sauce, vegetable, meat – is meant to “elevate the fish to the next level.”
Ripert’s menu – which is divided into “Almost Raw,” “Barely Touched,” and “Lightly Cooked” ­– speaks to more than just the restaurant’s pescatarian emphasis. Le Bernardin is a shrine to fish, and Ripert has found his own way to demonstrate his reverence for the ingredients: by leaving them alone. His world-famous dishes hardly touch the fish – “the star of the plate” – at all.
While Ripert is a poissonier – or a chef charged with cooking fish – he does not exclude any ingredient from his menu and currently offers a filet mignon, a roast guinea hen, and a truffle pasta, should fish not be of a customer’s taste.
“When you are a chef, you have to love cooking everything. You can’t be selective and say, ‘Oh, I like to cook only this ingredient, and I don’t like those ingredients,’” he said.
“If you have this kind of a state of mind, suddenly, you will not pay attention and respect to the ingredients that you don’t necessarily like.”
Cooking is not an art that serves the chef, but one that serves the ingredients: It attempts to pay homage to nature’s gifts and elevate them to their utmost potential. “You have to like all of the ingredients equally and then apply different techniques to elevate each ingredient.”
Though, Ripert admits, this pursuit of liking to cook everything equally is a difficult one — even he doesn’t entirely follow this philosophy. One thing Ripert doesn’t do, for instance, is pastry; but, he said, “Pastry is very different than cooking, yet it’s much more scientific, in a sense. You really have to follow the recipes carefully because, if not, you don’t get the results.”
Whereas, in cooking, there’s “a lot of improvisation,” Ripert said. “It’s a little bit like playing jazz, if I may, and you can express yourself in many different ways.”
If that’s the case, Ripert has a talent, then, for improvisation – for playing jazz. In his almost thirty years as chef of Le Bernardin, Ripert has maintained the restaurant’s astounding three Michelin Stars, as well as its four New York Times stars (the highest awarded). Just last year, it was ranked as the best restaurant in the world by La Liste for the third time.
Le Bernardin is known around the world for its unforgiving excellence, its icy commitment to perfection.
Le Bernardin is fine dining.
Beginnings.
Though the names Ripert and Le Bernardin go hand-in-hand, Ripert did not start the world-famous establishment. Maguy Le Coze – the co-owner of the restaurant with Ripert today – started the restaurant in Paris in 1972 with her brother, Gilbert Le Coze. With her brother handling the kitchen and her handling the dining room – and the business itself – Le Coze had high aspirations for Le Bernardin.
In a New York Times article, Le Coze recalled her desire to open a restaurant in New York: “To me it was a vision, a spiritual thing, if you believe in those things.”
Le Coze’s vision became reality fairly quickly, and just 14 years after Le Bernardin’s conception in Paris in 1972, Le Coze and her brother moved the restaurant to New York City. The accolades would follow almost immediately.
Then, Gilbert Le Coze suddenly passed away in 1994, and Maguy Le Coze appointed a young Ripert, who had worked with Gilbert, as head chef of Le Bernardin. Since then, Ripert has made Le Bernardin’s kitchen his own.
“I am in the kitchen every day, five days a week, lunch and dinner,” he said.
Food.
Despite creating intricately evocative dishes that maintain the restaurant’s prestige, Ripert has a very simple view on the role of food in the community. “First of all, food is very important because you have to nourish people,” Ripert said.
Ripert is the Vice Chairman of City Harvest, a nonprofit independent organization that combats food insecurity in New York City. City Harvest’s website notes that, “Nearly 1.5 million New Yorkers now experience food insecurity, including one in four children, according to a 2021 analysis by Feeding America.”
Recently, City Harvest started hosting “mobile markets” in food deserts in New York. “So, twice a week, we have a market where we bring – let’s say – four different vegetables and we bring two or three fruits, and people who have a special access card come to the market, and they pick and choose what they need to feed their family.”
“So, therefore, they can cook at home and have the family together around the table,” Ripert said. The importance of food – while based in simple nourishment – builds community; it brings the family to the table.
City Harvest operates with Feeding America, an organization which helps pair the charity with farmers with a surplus of food or food that will soon expire, Ripert explains. Sending trucks to bring the surplus to their facility, City Harvest organizes, sorts, and stores items carefully, before distributing the food. Ripert also notes that City Harvest is financed without government aid, which allows the organization to make its own decisions and move very quickly.
According to Ripert, City Harvest delivers to 400 food pantries and about 100 million pounds of food, per year, in New York City. “Food, first of all, has that function to make sure that people are not hungry and do not become ill and sick and, of course, die of starvation,” Ripert said.
On an ethical and sustainable side, “good practices with food are very important,” Ripert said. “You want to support local farmers as much as you can – small farmers as much as you can – if you can afford to buy organic and local.” But, as Ripert pointed out, that’s often unaffordable. “Because sometimes it's too expensive and you may not have the budget to spend and therefore you cannot do that. But if you have that luxury, I think it's very important to support people who have good practices."
Ripert adapts his menus per season to maintain his emphasis on local produce as much as possible, though there are difficulties presented by the pursuit of locavorism. “We try to use ingredients that are coming in the winter – like root vegetables – but you cannot run a restaurant only with root vegetables, so we have to import during the difficult season.”
And, of course, Ripert does everything in his power to support local fishermen, again putting sustainable practices at the forefront of his model. Most of the species that are served at Le Bernardin, Ripert describes, are from the East Coast. However, some exceptions are made: Some species are caught off the West Coast, and some are flown in, overnight, from Japan.
“We don’t buy fish from factory boats,” Ripert said. “We try not to buy fish from farms either because fish farming has a lot of challenges still, that I dislike, in terms of sustainability, in terms of flavor for the seafood. Also in terms of comfort for the animals – I mean they are packed in those tanks and I don’t really like that. Very often they have antibiotics injected and so on, and even they are genetically modified,” Ripert said.
Besides its most fundamental purpose and the importance of sustainability, personally and culturally, food serves a very different role. Ripert said, “And when you are someone like me, you teach younger generations your culture or you teach them how to be creative. You teach them how to be respectful and it’s a way of educating. It’s a way of also preserving the culture and what has been done in the past.”
Learning how to cook – really learning – is taught by those who have come before; there’s only so much that can be learned in a recipe book. Cooking is passed down from chef to chef, from person to person, and with each new generation, the recipe changes; tweaks are made, focuses change.
Ripert remembers his grandmothers: One who was from the north of Italy and one who was from Provence, in the south of France. “Both of them cooked different type of food. Very similar, Mediterranean style.”
They cooked “soul food — home food but with a lot of soul from their region,” he said.
First and foremost, food carries culture with it; and people carry the food. Inspired by both grandmothers – who cooked different cuisines ­­– Ripert understands the cultural significance of the food he ate and the experiences in which he partook.
Then, the world of gastronomy changed.
“It was the beginning of what we call nouvelle cuisine in the ’70s. Chefs in France were starting to become celebrities as well.”
Ripert’s mother became interested in this trend: “She was creating meals for me that were very sophisticated and delicious as well, but very different than my grandmother.”
"My grandmother didn’t really care about presentation and about how refine[d] the china has to be, or what we call l’art de la table ­­– the way you decorate your table – and so on. My mother really did care about that.”
“Exposed to both styles at a young age,” Ripert described how his passion for cooking developed first from eating what his grandmothers and mother made, watching them make the food, and then eventually cooking himself. From attending different schools and moving around as a child, Ripert’s first formal introduction to cooking was at a culinary school in Perpignan.
Ripert grew up in the kitchen, starting at La Tour d’Argent – the legendary restaurant in Paris that was founded in 1582 and frequently visited by Henry IV. Following his years at La Tour d’Argent, Ripert moved to Jamin to work under the world-famous Chef Joël Robuchon.
“Joël Robuchon was considered one of the best chef[s] in the world in [the] ’80s and in the ’90s.”
Even in a restaurant with a roughly 3:5 cook-to-client ratio, Ripert noted the long “15 to 18” hour workdays and the obsessive dedication that was required to satisfy Robuchon’s exacting standards. “Joël Robuchon was a very demanding chef, with himself and with his team,” Ripert said.
“In the mid-’80s in France, kitchens were rough. The chef was a little bit of a dictator and young cooks were verbally abused and sometimes physically abused. You were being kicked in the butt or punched in the shoulders, or they would throw plates at you or pots and pans.”
But, “Joël Robuchon was very different.”
“He will use words to hurt you instead of breaking plates on the floor or punching you.” This strategy was extremely difficult to endure, and, ultimately, Robuchon was able to inflict the same level of pain on his cooks as chefs who were physically violent, Ripert said.
“For instance, if you had a passion for creating sauce, he [Robuchon] would say to you, ‘You know, you don’t care about the sauce. You have no passion. You will never be a saucier. Just give up. Just do something else. You will never make it in fine dining, so you should quit.’”
Though Robuchon would forget about his words by the end of the day, according to Ripert, the damage would have already been done. That stays with you. “That was really Joël Robuchon’s style, but, again, I never experienced, in his kitchen, violence – physical violence.”
THC: Would you have done it again, knowing where you would eventually end up?
Eric Ripert: “Yes, I will go back. I mean, if I had to go back, I will go back, because I achieve[d] in my life the dream. I wanted to be the chef that I am, with the team that I have, and the restaurant where I am.”
“[There] was no choice at the time. It was in the culture; it was like that. Today, if you scream at your cooks or if you are abusive, you probably end up with a lawsuit, and you lose your cooks. At the time, it was accepted. It was something that was everywhere.”
Despite the hardships, Ripert recalled that he learned much under Robuchon’s wing; in his memoir, “32 Yolks,” he wrote, “As terrified as I was of Robuchon, I stayed at Jamin, and returned for a second tour, because I knew that he was teaching me more than I could have learned anywhere else.”
Focus.
Ripert, famously, puts all of his energy into one restaurant: Le Bernardin.
Other talented chefs have not followed this same career path. Thomas Keller has 10 establishments, though three of his restaurants ­­– The French Laundry in Napa Valley, Per Se in New York, and The Surf Club in Miami – are his primary focus. Daniel Boulud has twenty establishments, though his flagship restaurant, Daniel, is in New York.
Ripert has partnered with his sommelier from Le Bernardin, Aldo Sohm, in the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar in New York City, which is a casual establishment that serves wine with light food. “It doesn’t really request much from me.”
Ripert also has a restaurant, Blue, in Grand Cayman. The restaurant “is luxurious – similar to Le Bernardin, much smaller. And it’s in a Ritz Carlton Hotel. And, it’s basically like a licensing-consulting agreement that I have with them, which means that we basically dictate the menu and overlook the quality, so I send a team there and I send a team to be also trained in New York.”
“And, myself, I go twice a year, or three times a year, but it’s not really demanding. Basically, most of my time is dedicated to Le Bernardin; it’s what I want to do.”
One restaurant. One focus.
“I am not anti developing businesses,” Ripert said. “And the chefs who are developing many concepts, restaurants, and so on, very often are very good friends, and I respect what they are doing. But, I don’t have any pleasure in doing that.”
Ripert notes that Le Bernardin is a quite financially stable business as well. They serve roughly 100 lunches and 150 dinners per day, in addition to the private events, which allows Ripert and his “employees to have good salaries, good compensations,” he said. “And I am fairly content with what I have in terms of compensations.”
“I can feed my family, I can live comfortably, I will probably retire comfortably as well. And, therefore, I don’t see the need for myself to focus on other places.”
Above all else, Ripert is an artist, an artisan. He cooks because he loves to cook, to create dishes, to bring people happiness and give them a special experience. “I like to be very hands-on. Today, at my age, my main job is to mentor a younger team, but I like to be with my team. I like to be in the walls of Le Bernardin,” Ripert said.
Artists do not create art for the money: They create art to express themselves, to grasp at different ideas and explore the world in new ways. Ripert’s medium, as a chef, is, of course, food, and he knows the importance of evolution.
THC: In the many years you’ve been at Le Bernardin, how has your menu evolved or adapted? Where do you see yourself moving in the future?
ER: “We try to not have too many signature dishes because, if you have too many signature dishes, then you do not evolve anymore; you are stuck with your signature dishes. But, if I can make an analogy, it’s like the Rolling Stones not wanting to sing ‘Satisfaction.’ You expect that from them. Therefore, we have a couple of signature dishes because they are strong statements from us.”
Perhaps Ripert’s dish that is most like the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction” is one of the simplest ones; paper thin tuna over a thin toasted baguette with foie gras. It’s simple, straightforward, and yet, this dish is known around the world. Though it incorporates different ingredients, it has one purpose: to elevate the fish to the highest possible level. That’s the goal of Le Bernardin. A goal that has – one can safely say – been achieved.
“It’s also a very personal approach,” he said. Ripert draws from his experiences traveling to different countries, bringing inspiration back to Le Bernardin. He notes proudly that he has traveled to every continent. Yet, the city also inspires him. “The creativity comes from my experience of being a New Yorker, which means I’m exposed to different cultures, different techniques, different ingredients.”
In addition to being inspired by places and cultures, Ripert, of course, is also inspired by many chefs. “I was in Paris, for instance, in December, I went to eat at Guy Savoy twice, and I had twice an amazing experience. So, Guy Savoy was a great moment for me and an inspiration.”
Though everything – whatever is learned – has to support the restaurant’s purpose: Le Bernardin’s “model is about seafood, elevating seafood,” Ripert stated simply.
New York City is one of the major centers of the culinary world, and “I have the luck to go to many other restaurants, interact with chefs,” Ripert said. In a city where so much gastronomic innovation happens every day, it must be very easy to see certain trends emerge in the culinary world.
However, trends, Ripert said, “are very difficult to predict, and trends do not last, usually.”
THC: What do you think the future trends of the culinary world will be, how food and dining will change in the future?
ER: “We are seeing a generation of cooks coming now with a certain awakening, if I may, about the wellbeing of the planet, about the wellbeing of the animals, about the wellbeing of the consumers. And I think that is probably very important because it’s really changing or imposing on certain industries different principles.”
Yet, despite the evolving focus, “fine dining is fine dining,” Ripert said.
“We have different, very different, models of fine dining. But, you create an experience that is ultra-luxurious. That’s the definition of fine dining.”
Luxury. From the sharply dressed waiters to the delicate porcelain dishware, Le Bernardin definitely exudes luxury. Though, fine dining can take many shapes and forms: a behind-the-counter sushi restaurant, a Western establishment like Le Bernardin, a long family-style table, a trendy restaurant with loud music and ambiance, Ripert notes.
“It’s hard to predict the future because you will always have people who want to go party, you will always have people who want to have a luxurious experience, the traditional way,” Ripert said. “But again, what is important is the mindset about being aware of what’s going on on our planet.”
In the kitchen, Ripert asks his team and sous chefs to take Le Bernardin’s model, standard, and inspiration “and, in these parameters, to create.” Yet, he is there; he is in the kitchen. He makes sure that each dish is made under “the philosophy of Le Bernardin.”
Devotion. Commitment. Balance.
THC: “Outside of the kitchen, who are you in life?”
ER: “I am the co-owner of the restaurant and the chef of Le Bernardin. So, when I come here, I wear my chef jacket, and I play the role of being the leader of the restaurant and the kitchen; and it’s a big job. And then, outside, I am Eric.”
After many years of working in kitchens – including his experience with Robuchon – Ripert knows the painful atmospheres some kitchens can promote. Yet, Ripert learned from these moments of hardship, stress, and obsession. He understands the importance of taking that step back, of finding the balance, of finding peace – of living his life in a different way.
“I have discipline, and I make sure that I don’t overwork and don’t dedicate too much time to the restaurant, because I think you need to find balance. And, I find balance by spending time with my family, spending time on my own.”
“By taking time for yourself, you take distance,” Ripert said. “You take distance to think and reflect and see what you can do that is going to be positive for everybody. And, that’s my way of living my life.”
Ripert’s love for cooking, love for his ingredients, and unwavering sense of peace and satisfaction are clear to anyone who meets him. Ripert is a chef; that’s who he is. He’s a chef who has devoted his entire life to one thing: cooking seafood at Le Bernardin.
He is a chef. He is a poissonier. And, he’s one of the best chefs in the world; Le Bernardin is one of the best restaurants in the world.
While the Indian laurels, hyacinths, lemon trees, terracotta rooftops, and sea-swept stone houses in Antibes couldn’t follow Ripert on his arduous odyssey, the sea could. And did.

Minor spoilers for “Class of ’07” ahead. 
Amazon Prime Video’s new show “Class of ’07” will make one fear going to their high school reunion in an unbelievably engaging way. This reunion of an all-girls high school starts off dramatic and silly, then dives deeper into the past secrets of the alumnae main cast. Eight episodes, each averaging a half-an-hour, take viewers on a wild ride with a delightfully chaotic plot.
The season takes the format of present dialogue between the classmates and then flashbacks that tie back into the conversations they had in their youth. This angle highlights the characters’ processes of introspection, as the storyline becomes continuously more complicated and the women become more disconnected from their current realities.
The show starts as Zoe (Emily Browning), who is having quite a rough time after a dating show based in Australia, stumbles into her high school reunion very underdressed. She warns others about some dangerous weather approaching their island-based high school, but she is seen as the embodiment of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. After this, the whole atmosphere of the show takes a sharp turn foreshadowing the chaos that is about to unfold.
After disaster strikes and the former classmates are stranded on the island at their former alma mater, the group is both literally and figuratively lost. Naturally, a leader is picked, Saskia (Caitlin Stasey), who organizes the masses temporarily, but she quickly implodes and is set to a “trial.” Saskia is not a very likable character, but she is quite dynamic and drives the plot forward. Her manipulative tendencies that are later then exposed, add some complexity to her leadership style and the interpersonal conflict between the stranded girls.
Another important plot point intertwined with the relationships between the girls surrounds why Amelia (Megan Smart) left school early. Zoe, her former best friend, holds Amelia’s hasty exit against her without knowing why she left, or about her current struggles with mental health. Once the truth comes out, Amelia’s past need for pills resurfaces throughout the prior episodes, as well as her going off the grid during high school.
This isn’t the only shocking example of truths that came out while the Class of ’07 is stranded on the island: The disappearance of one of their former classmates on the island is brought into question, and Saskia’s secret traumatizing high school relationship is revealed.
This plot twist quickly pivots the show into a more serious tone as the alumnae digest their high school pasts and become more honest with each other than they ever were before. But this newfound connection isn’t enough to create a warm and fuzzy ending.
Although the show is strong overall, it would be made better with more background information on the characters, which would promote more emphasis on character development. If viewers were able to better know — and therefore care more — about the main cast, this would create more engagement with the plot, rather than the entertainment factor coming from pure drama and plot twists. Relying on just the complexities within a storyline keeps viewers hooked for the time they’re watching the show, but it doesn’t make the details of it very memorable.
“Class of ’07” would be an ideal show for anyone looking for a combination of humor, complex interpersonal relationships with unfinished business, and consistent unpredictability of the plot. One can watch ready to play detective, be slightly confused at times, and to periodically remind themself this was supposed to be a high school reunion. However, it is worth noting that this show does explore many sensitive topics and is quite dark at moments.

The controversy around experiments involving infant monkeys and their mothers in professor Margaret S. Livingstone’s lab at Harvard Medical School highlights the importance of education at the intersection of science and ethics. It also calls our attention to a very specific set of injustices happening within our own community.
As a student in the Master of Bioethics program at Harvard Medical School, I am deeply invested in the ethics underpinning the research on which we base our medical advancements. It’s clear that other people are, too. Recently, tens of thousands of individuals, including members of the Harvard community, have signed petitions and letters that get it right: Despite her statements to the contrary, Livingstone’s research is cruel, unnecessary, and morally indefensible.
The backlash against invasive research on primate infants and their mothers is no surprise. Such research conflicts with some of our strongest beliefs. Our sense of how we ought to behave — the normative component of ethics — is informed by deeply ingrained values stemming from culture, religion, our families, and more. The belief that we should not harm others is a value that’s widely accepted and reflected in law. But our actions and laws sometimes exclude animals from this sphere of moral consideration, even though they should not.
It turns out that Americans are concerned with how animals are treated in all settings, including scientific research. According to Gallup, 67 percent of Americans surveyed indicated they’re “Very/Somewhat Concerned” with the treatment of animals used in research. Only three percent of respondents said they believed animals need minimal protections from harm “since they are just animals.”
That we love and care about animals is no surprise. They’re members of our families. We’ve formed core childhood memories with them during visits to parks, on camping trips, and in classrooms.
Why, then, do we accept a status quo that says it is acceptable to harm animals in scientific research so long as there’s a small chance it might benefit humans?
Many gifts given to us by scientific research have come at the expense of the subjects involved in that research, some of whom have been human, the majority of whom have been nonhuman, and nearly all of whom can suffer and feel pain. Still, according to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated 95 percent of drugs proven safe and effective in animal models fail during human clinical trials. Both humans and animals are harmed by such failures.
The claim that Livingstone’s current research is scientifically justifiable has been criticized by individuals with far more expertise in primatology, neurobiology, and bioethics than myself, and I will only point you to their well-documented dissenting views.
It should be clear: It is a mistake to question the credibility of their views by classifying them as emotional appeals. We cannot and should not disconnect one of the defining features of humanity — our capacity for empathy — from our moral sensibilities. As bioethicists-in-training at HMS, we’re taught to interrogate our emotional biases and carefully consider them in decision-making — not to silence or dismiss them.
Where would we be if we stuffed our emotions into our pockets when witnessing suffering and injustice? Bearing witness to suffering has inspired critical social change in response to atrocities like slavery, apartheid, and the Holocaust. And, as I’ve argued before, excluding emotion from research does not make for good science. Moreover, it’s been demonstrated that people who care for animals in research labs suffer severe mental anguish. There is harm in ignoring emotion and violating one’s own moral values.
But the harder question we need to answer is: Even if this research is beneficial to humanity, should we be doing it?
Livingstone’s research is legal, but legality is not morality. We can all easily recall many instances in which what was legal was shockingly immoral. Is human exceptionalism in scientific research different from the other forms of legalized exceptionalism that have hurt vulnerable groups?
Neither the awards and large sums of funding that Dr. Livingstone’s research on monkeys has received, nor its approval by Harvard’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, indicates it is ethical or even necessary. IACUCs are self-regulating bodies whose standards vary by institution and based on the individual composition of each IACUC. This does not make those involved in this research immoral people. Instead, it evidences a broken system that devalues the moral worth of nonhuman animals.
Alternative technologies to replace animals in research are in development, but they aren’t yet fully sufficient. This shouldn’t hold us back. It is intellectually dishonest to use moral arguments to justify technological and scientific insufficiencies. Our present (and seemingly temporary) inability to completely replace monkeys with non-sentient technologies does not make their exploitation ethically justifiable — not even when it might help humans.
In the meantime, we can commit to urgently advancing those replacement technologies. We can also commit to research frameworks that emphasize non-maleficence to better protect animals. Harvard prides itself on being a leader, and this is a place where it can lead.
Being critical of institutional practices is not a rejection of the institution or its constituents. As a proud Harvard Medical School student, I aim to elevate both myself and our school. Just as I push myself to question my long-held beliefs, so too should the place where I learn. We’re fortunate to be surrounded by abundant intellect and innovation. Here in the Harvard ecosystem, viable alternatives to animal research are being developed. Sometimes, we neglect to question the status quo. At a leading institution like ours, that’s just not good enough.

In Jorge Luis Borges’ single-paragraph tale “Del rigor en la ciencia,” the Argentine short-story writer envisions a mythical kingdom where “the art of cartography attained such perfection” that its ruler decided to construct a map identical in both size and shape to the realm itself. In this fictional land, reality and its reconstruction became one and the same.
Many have argued, to varying degrees of persuasiveness, that Borges’ fable is not at all as absurd as it might seem, especially with imitating or replicating reality becoming ever easier in today’s increasingly technological society. In the 1980s, French sociologist Jean Baudillard made this very observation in “Simulacres et Simulation,” using the Borges story to introduce a dense critique of the increasing prevalence of imitation and other forms of unoriginality in mass culture. To Baudrillard, it had simply become too easy to replace something original with a copy that was sufficiently verisimilar, thus blurring the distinctions of authenticity enough to render them effectively meaningless.
Baudrillard has surely then rolled much in his grave over the past few months, as access to both natural language interfaces, such as ChatGPT, and engines for producing art from generative machine learning algorithms, such as those powering DALL-E and Midjourney, have finally been granted to the public. While computational tools have been in the contemporary creator’s toolbox for decades, the immense amount of apparent originality that these newfangled models seem to be capable of has simply been too much for some artists, as what may be best described as a moral panic has swept through creative communities and stimulated charged debate about the threat of AI to the “essence” of what art is.
Permit me to use a historical perspective to assuage these worries. I hold that, at least with respect to the production of art, the emergence of generative computational tools that many have — in my humble opinion, too hurriedly — touted as “artificial intelligence” is no different from any of the other technological innovations that have been introduced to the fine arts at one point or another in the past.
Take, for instance, something that seems as mundane nowadays as photography. When first invented and introduced to the public, the photograph drew scathing criticism from both artists of the time, such as John Ruskin, and art critics, including Baudelaire and Wölfflin.
However, over time, photography gradually became an integral part of the visual arts — first as a potent source of inspiration for painters such as Gustave Courbet, who exhibited a deep interest in interpreting photographs through painting. Today, his “Le Puits Noir” hangs prominently in a second-floor gallery of the Harvard Art Museums among the works of Cézanne, Renoir, and other contemporaries who were similarly influenced in their art by the advent of photography.
More recently, photography has even gained acceptance as a medium of artistic expression in its own right. As the multitude of photojournalistic works in the Harvard Art Museums collections — from the powerfully titled “Refugee in Hiding, Miami” to Dorothea Lange’s famous images of the Depression — demonstrate, the proliferation of a new technology need not be viewed as an existential threat to the fine arts. Rather, it should be welcomed by artists as a new medium of personal expression that can help their natural ingenuity and originality shine further.
Keep in mind that it is us humans who are the ultimate arbitrators of what constitutes “art.” The generative algorithms that have captured the public imagination rely fundamentally on building off of artistic motifs created by human agents. Their products represent the highest form of Baudillard’s simulacra, for even though they seem original, they are far from it.
Not only that, consider how important the process of making art is to its designation of originality. A human artist undergoes a process of extensive reflection, whether about their external environment or internal world, that directly affects the outcome of their work. But just like how making a gicleé of an original van Gogh requires no more creativity than it takes to use a printer, the method by which an algorithm produces a piece of art is categorically mechanistic. There is no reflection and no cognition intrinsic to its operation, and at best, it is the human who is providing the text or media input who contributes any semblance of creative vitality to the process. The algorithm couldn’t care less.
So, do not fear. As long as humans continue to be creative, the artistic cultures we cherish will continue to flourish. Yes, the economics of supply and demand suggest that the ability of “art AI” to provide vacuous eye candy in seconds will place downwards pressure on the market for simple illustrations, but if the digital camera hasn’t been able to extinguish the market for individual and family portraiture, what’s so different now?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Buffalo buffalo might buffalo other Buffalo buffalo, but we hope that Harvard students don’t buffalo other Harvard students.
It seems the administration agrees: Harvard recently released final versions of our first University-wide non-discrimination and anti-bullying policies. These policies, initiated by working groups formed following the graduate student union’s 2020 contract with Harvard, will take effect Sept. 1.
This historic moment speaks to the extensive power of labor on campus. Our love for labor is no surprise, but it goes beyond our fundamental belief in fair compensation. Unions create a palpable spirit of inclusion and solidarity that transcends issues of pay and benefits. Labor leaders have been some of our school’s fiercest responders to the egregious faculty misconduct that has littered the past years.
We must withhold our applause for the policies, however, until we can see the final sexual harassment and misconduct policies, which are scheduled for after the Biden administration releases its Title IX updates. A rigorous grievance procedure for sexual harassment complaints was one of the most prominent demands of the union when bargaining for their 2020 contract. Given the University’s record of lethargy and inaction, we hold little hope for Harvard’s final sexual harassment resolution procedures to meet this standard.
At a University where the news is inundated with reveals of abusive figures on campus, we welcome the policies’ formal framework for resolution. But, as we have previously written in the context of sexual harassment, bullying is a cultural problem, not a policy one.
Cultural problems require cultural fixes. Policies enacted by an impersonal, sprawling bureaucracy should not dislocate students from their essential role in creating a better, kinder, more inclusive Harvard.
We believe deeply in the power of student self-governance — in the great things that students can achieve when given the freedom to articulate and realize a vision for this campus. The future leaders that Harvard intends to educate must lead themselves now, through the formative cycle of trying, failing, and growing.
As each Harvard school develops the underlying structure to support the University-wide policies, we encourage the schools to consider how they can implement these policies in collaboration with — rather than in the stead of — their communities.
Successful community-centered organizational models for reconciliation abound. For example, restorative justice circles — a practice with deep historical roots in Indigenous communities — bring together affected parties, supporters, and facilitators in constructive dialogue aimed at sharing feelings and repairing harms.
At Harvard, this practice could look like a confidential, Honor Council-like entity embedded in Houses, academic departments, or other administrative units — or a Harvard Ombuds Office-led mechanism for convening restorative justice circles. For issues pertaining to larger groups, town halls or open forums could be held.
These suggestions should not be taken to mean that all or even most disagreements will be well-suited to community-led mediation. Many serious disputes, especially those that rise to the level of harassment or discrimination, have good reason to remain confidential. Goals for student leadership should not be prioritized above the needs of students who have been harmed.
Nevertheless, we feel there is a wide expanse of issues — wider than many might think — across which community mediation can find purchase. Too often, we shy away from conflict resolution conversations based on false assumptions that they are too difficult to adjudicate and that we are not qualified. But we have faith in the ability of our peers to engage thoughtfully and respectfully on matters with real stakes.
And even if we aren’t perfect mediators yet, this is simply another skill to attempt, blunder, and learn from in college. As we have argued over the years, students must be willing to engage in productive discourse. The same principle holds when it comes to the community we call home, the community made out of each individual one of us, constantly striving for more.

Across the world, Black women are ditching the silk press and embracing their natural hair in a growing movement, rejecting Eurocentric beauty standards. But taking care of their natural hair can be expensive. In the United States alone, Black Americans collectively spent $473 million on hair care in 2017, with Black women buying nine times as many products than white women on average.
But with products filled with unpronounceable chemicals like linalool methylparaben and methylisothiazolinone, one might begin to wonder: What exactly are Black women putting in their hair, and what does it mean for their health?
This question piqued the interest of associate professor of Environmental Reproductive Epidemiology at Harvard’s School of Public Health Tamarra James-Todd. She first heard how toxic chemicals in hair products adversely impact young girls during a lecture in an environmental health course. But after searching for an answer, she quickly found that few studies had looked at the health effects of the products that she and her peers grew up using as Black women.
“I found two studies total at the time on hair product use and any risk factors, particularly chronic disease risk factors that were related to reproductive health outcomes,” James-Todd says. “Why is it that I can find a number of things on hair dyes, but I can’t find much of anything on products that people of color might be using more?”
Filling in this critical gap eventually became the aim of James-Todd’s doctoral dissertation, culminating in the Greater New York Hair Products Study. Data from 359 women across the New York City-area confirmed racial patterns in hair product usage with Black women most likely to use hair oil when compared to Latina and white women. The study also found an important link between hair product usage and health: those who used hair oil in childhood were almost twice as likely to report having their first period before the age of 12, an established risk factor for developing breast cancer later in life.
James-Todd believes the dearth of available data on this glaring health issue was in part due to a cultural blindspot on behalf of researchers.
“I’m not talking about shampoo and conditioner. I’m talking about things that people put on and then add on again, and then again,” she says.
Since many researchers weren’t familiar with the kinds of hair products and routines used more frequently by women of color, “the value of those questions wasn’t being taken as seriously,” she says.
Now the founder of the Environmental Reproductive Justice Lab at the Harvard’s School of Public Health, James-Todd focuses on understanding how environmental exposures adversely affect women’s reproductive health with a particular focus on pregnancy and postpartum maternal health.
Armed with a team of research assistants, scientists, and students, the lab explores how personal care products impact maternal health at a molecular level. In 2021, James-Todd and colleagues reported that Black women were more likely to use hair products with ingredients like placenta or parabens. The team then sent a sample of commonly used hair products to the laboratory and found that they caused levels of estrogen to rise, which increases the risk of developing ovarian cancer. The results suggest a reasonable biological mechanism to explain how chemicals in the bottle might harm Black women’s health.
The team has also studied what specific products might be more harmful. In 2022, James-Todd and colleagues found that pregnant women who reported using hair oil had higher rates of harmful chemicals in their bodies than those who use hair lotion and leave-in conditioners. For James-Todd and colleagues, these findings could help specify ways to reduce exposure to reproductive toxins.
The team is also sensitive to how larger forces differentially shape exposure to harmful chemicals. Marissa Chan, a current Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Environmental Health, is collecting data on more than 26,000 hair products in over 24 Boston neighborhoods to determine the racial and ethnic differences between areas with easily accessible safer hair products and those without.
“So people who are using these products, perhaps because of the socially driven factors, are having things impacting their hormone receptors, and that could be contributing to the differences that we’re seeing in health outcomes,” James-Todd says. She notes, however, that these associations are still being rigorously tested.
But beyond changing what products people buy, the Environmental Reproductive Justice Lab is sensitive to how individual choices to buy unsafe beauty products are shaped by policy.
“Up until just earlier this year, our laws and policies around that had not changed since the 1930s. Even now, the change that has occurred doesn’t have the level of protection that is set in other countries,” James-Todd says, pointing at a lack of regulation in beauty products as a potential cause for disparities.
James-Todd hopes to closely engage with the communities most directly impacted by environmental health disparities by partnering with them in the research process. “You can’t come and do research within or on communities or populations without representation of those community members,” James-Todd says.
To that end, James-Todd serves as the director of the Community Engagement Core for Harvard’s Metals and Metal Mixtures, Cognitive Aging, Remediation and Exposure Sources Superfund Research Center. In this role, she partners with a local faith-based organization to develop an environmental science research curriculum for children living in communities most impacted by her work.
“It was a really phenomenal opportunity to have kids get inspired by bioscience and also think through what they can do about it,” James-Todd says. Besides having students develop and test their own scientific hypotheses, the program brings in environmental justice activists to show “how children and teens and young adults can really be strong advocates and activists involved in the environmental justice movement.”
James-Todd says achieving health equity is impossible without the contributions of other scientists of color, especially those of the younger generation. “You bring your own unique experiences and set of questions to the table that are just as valuable, just as important, and in fact, when we are dealing with and grappling with health disparities and environmental justice issues, may be even more important than the things that we are studying,” she says. “Without your voices, we can’t achieve health equity.”
James-Todd hopes her research will reach the broader public, so she created the “Beauty + Justice” podcast, which debuted in November 2022. In each episode, James-Todd sits down with women of color that are experts in the fields of beauty, health, and science and explores the social context of problematic beauty standards and their adverse impacts on people’s physical and mental health.
“As academics, particularly in a place and space and moment in time where our expertise is being challenged, I think part of that scientific misinformation, or misinformation in general, and disinformation that is out there really stems from our lack of accountability, and taking ownership and responsibility for translating our work,” James-Todd says. For her, the onus is on researchers to make sure their research is “accessible to everyone, that people can understand what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.”
In November 2022, James-Todd received the School of Public Health’s Alice Hamilton Award, which is given to a female faculty member to recognize their impact on public health and their future promise.
“My ‘why’ is giving voice to people who have had less voice than me,” James-Todd says. “I’m here for that reason, and for such a time as this.”

This April 1, a breezy Saturday night, a lively crowd dances to “No Rompas Mi Corazón” in Adams House dining hall, the aroma of frijoles refritos and arroz rojo wafting through the air. You wouldn’t know from their energy on the dance floor that minutes earlier, they had been sitting quietly, attentively watching a documentary about trans lives, vulnerability, and the meaning of freedom.
A party that educates as much as it celebrates, TransQuinceañera, an event hosted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Latinx Student Association and the LGBTQ@GSAS Association, has invited the Harvard community to a vibrant evening of art and activism.
“I create another narrative of the ritual. That night, I become the TransQuinceañera,” says the star of the show, Lía García, also known by her stage name La Novia Sirena. “For me, it’s important to create these safe spaces to celebrate our transitions and to talk in first person.”
García is an artist, activist, and educator who performs at quinceañeras at educational institutions, prisons, train stations, and other public spaces to spread awareness of trans issues. She collaborated with the GSAS associations to put on this event in honor of Trans Day of Visibility and Women’s History Month, as well as to celebrate the intersectionality of gender and heritage.
The night starts off with a showing of “Mis XXy Años,” a documentary by Ebony Bailey showcasing La Novia Sirena’s performance art (La Novia Sirena translates to “the mermaid bride”). The documentary is narrated by García, entirely in Spanish, expressing her childhood fantasies of embodying femininity, and features scenes of her in her hometown, Mexico City, spinning in bejeweled pink taffeta in a plaza and dancing with a blue parasol in a subway station. In the documentary, crowds are drawn to her elaborate dresses, and linger to hear her message.
After the screening ends, García herself emerges in a red and zebra print quinceañera dress, her face lit up with a warm smile as she floats around the room of intent listeners.
“Think about how many cages we have in our own body,” she asks her audience, as she passes around a cage, inviting individuals to hold it and release what makes them feel trapped as a lesson of the importance of freedom. She asks the audience, “When was the last time a professor asked you how you’re doing?”
“I really loved her message about thinking about the possibility of reshaping the university and academic spaces as spaces of care and tenderness,” says Massiel Torres Ulloa, a Ph.D. candidate in Romance Languages and Literature.
Momentarily, García’s presentation is interrupted by sudden rapping on the rightmost window. The audience’s gaze is disturbed by a man standing outside, only illuminated by the light from inside the room, giving the finger. There are murmured groans of disdain and a beat of confusion. But García stands boldly, still smiling, dismissing the act of hate and continues conversing with her audience. Michael Ángel R. Vázquez, a Ph.D. candidate in Education and organizer of the event, smoothly shuts the curtain and steps outside Adams to address the stranger on the sidewalk.
A resident of Mexico, García intends her performance to be a political response as well as a social celebration. “I think the quinceañera has very patriarchal roots,” she says. “This emotional encounter of the TransQuinceañera is another kind of aesthetic, a political aesthetic, a response to the spectacle of violence.”
Performance art, for García, is a way to directly address the confining gender roles of machismo from her childhood, and a way to desexualize expressions of intimacy, like touch. “The performance is something for healing,” she says. “This is the power of art and the power of trans pedagogy that help us to heal the colonization that is in our bodies.”
As an LGBTQ+ person of Latin American heritage himself, Vázquez wants to emphasize the importance of intersectionality in allowing him to embrace his identity. “I also want to dispel the myth that communities of color are inherently more transphobic or homophobic. And that’s simply not true,” he says. “Our cultures are also rooted in love.”
García expresses her gratitude for Harvard’s welcome of her and the event, because she believes Harvard would benefit from a stronger LGBTQ+ community, from students to professors to faculty and staff. Though, Vázquez clarifies, “It was Jarvar that invited Lía.” Jarvar is an informal yet thriving community on campus established by the Latinx Student Association, affectionately named after a pronunciation of Harvard “the way many of our parents say it.”
Vázquez says TransQuinceañera is a “reclamation” of the harm that Harvard has caused to LGBTQ+ people, referencing the Secret Court of 1920, when LGBTQ+ identifying students were “actively hunted” and expelled by Harvard’s administration. “There’s this moral imperative that we feel by bringing it not just to academia, but to Harvard specifically, because of Harvard’s harm in promoting transphobia,” he says.
In a 2002 statement to The Crimson, former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers wrote that he expresses “deep regret” for the University’s past expulsion of LGBTQ+ identifying students.
“Whatever attitudes may have been prevalent then, persecuting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation is abhorrent and an affront to the values of our university,” he wrote. “We are a better and more just community today because those attitudes have changed as much as they have.”
Vázquez says TransQuinceañera serves as a both a source of entertainment and education.
“This is another way of pedagogy, of teaching, that’s so effective and so beautiful,” Vázquez says.

On a typical Tuesday at exactly 4:30 p.m., I find myself roaming Harvard Square. The sky rumbles ominously somewhere in the heavens, echoing the rumbling in my stomach. I’m aware Annenberg has just opened, but eating dinner at 4:30 is embarrassing. What I need is a snack, something to hold me over to 6 p.m. — real dinnertime. I deserve to treat myself after such a long day of procrastinating. Unfortunately, my feet begin moving before I even realize where I’m headed. Oh god. Am I… no… no, please —
It’s 4:31 p.m. and a craving has crashed into me with all the force of the shuttle that hit Tasty Burger last year. Tragic. With all my remaining strength, I crawl feebly past Russell House Tavern toward a coppery cave-like arch. It seems I’ve been driven to do the unthinkable, to commit the cardinal sin: purchase a nearly $14 açaí bowl from Life Alive Café.
I know I shouldn’t, but I have to. Just as Dante was fated to descend into the fiery pits of Hell, so must I. But instead of Virgil, I have Kourtney Kardashian. She might not be the most famous Roman poet of all time, but at least she sells organic love potions for $25 — that’s pretty much the next best thing. Looking around me, I see Kourt is nowhere to be found. Shit. I have to brave this alone. Hands shaking, I reach for the door.
After 30 minutes of convulsions, nervous sweats, and mild vomiting, I’m officially in the building. I’m careful to not fall for the gentle mood lighting and the tasteful JoJo Siwa x West-Elm collaboration they have going on. Underneath the pastel ombre veneer, I’m pretty sure that little Gwyneth Paltrows are hidden in the walls waiting to assault me with green juice. And they damn well know I would never survive anything with kale in it.
It’s 5:02 p.m., and I’ve almost gotten to the counter. The burden of being the only person in the café who’s not in athleisure is weighing on me. I didn’t know there was a dress code. It’s no big deal — this is a get-in, get-out type of situation.
I only have to order the açaí bowl and then I can leave. I start practicing the word “açaí” in preparation. Even though I’ve heard it countless times, I know that the moment I open my mouth I’m going to crumble.
A-sigh-ee.
Ahsiee.
I see.
I see now that I was never going to make it to the register.
Yoga mats populate my peripheral vision. It’s over. The yogis’ idle chatter stops. I reluctantly turn to face them. Somehow, in the span of two seconds, 15 women wearing Lululemon Aligns have morphed themselves into a pyramid formation. How is that physically possible?
Atop this human edifice stands the final boss. She unzips her crossbody linen satchel to reveal an arsenal of MLM essential oils. I turn to beg the cashier for mercy. She’s nowhere to be found. The bamboo lanterns flicker, folding to the wellness queen’s power. In her hand lies what looks like a urine sample. Organic!
“Tell me what this is,” she whispers, “Name it and prove that you belong.”
I take another look and it becomes clearer. I actually know this one.
“Too-mer-ick shot.”
But I spoke too soon.
“No. Tur-murr-ick elixir.”
And then I know I’m done for. As the pyramid disassembles to assume a weaponized tree pose, I take a sharp right down the stairs into the belly of the beast. Honestly, I’m kind of vibing with the interior decor until I feel a chill creep down my spine. Lo and behold: something far worse than what I had faced before. Cerberus, the guard dog of the underworld, pales in comparison to these dogs.
Bare feet are everywhere. I’m not even sure that all of them are attached to people. Oh God and the toes — wait — is that fungus? Oh god, my innocence. My wish for an açaí bowl is now officially a thing of the past. All I can see are sweaty feet dancing on the grave of my hopes and dreams.
I turn to flee in an attempt to escape the odor. Before I can move, I begin to see those miniature Gwyneth Paltrows claw through the Pottery Barn-esque wall. I knew it! I knew tiny little Gwyneth Paltrows were living in there! They move in tandem to present me with a Goop jade egg. I’m supposed to put that where? Absolutely not. I throw it to the floor in disgust and watch it crack open. A compostable gift card pokes out. The little Gwyneths smile encouragingly. Suddenly, I know exactly what I need to do.
“Thanks Gwyneth Paltrows — glad you guys are here and not hitting the slopes,” I whisper before running up the rest of the stairs.
My plan is to run a blitz: short and effective. With all my remaining courage, I barrel back into the exercise class screaming, “20 PERCENT OFF ON GUT MICROBIOME SUPERPOWDER, USUALLY $58 AT GOOP.” I throw the card behind me, effectively clearing my path out of the café. It’s truly over. I take one last look inside. Damn, those ancient grain bowls look kind of good. No… No, I can’t. 
I’ve made it out of Life Alive, thankfully, still alive.

One study. More than 12,000 patients. Countless variables in age, gender, lifestyle, smoking history, genomics, tumor samples, and more. A dynamic team of public health researchers, physicians, and computer scientists.
This is the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a long-running study of lung cancer patients that analyzes the disease’s genetic and environmental risk factors. But in recent years, the study reached a new frontier in medicine. The Harvard Artificial Intelligence in Medicine program has begun analyzing the dataset in unprecedented ways — by using artificial intelligence.
The BLCS began in 1992, when David C. Christiani, a professor at Harvard School of Public Health and a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, started recruiting a cohort of patients to study the interplay of genetics and the environment in lung cancer.
“There were some very strong connections between environment and disease that begged clarification between Nature and Nurture,” Christiani said in an email.
Since 1999, he has worked alongside Bruce E. Johnson ’75, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, to expand the BLCS patient cohort. “I believe this is the comprehensive lung cancer cohort,” Johnson wrote in an email.
Christiani and Johnson have built a dataset of thousands of patients, which encapsulates millions of variables, including genomes, lung scans, tumor samples, patient outcomes, and smoking histories. Given this volume of data, scientists have turned to artificial intelligence to more quickly and efficiently synthesize the information.
Hugo Aerts, the director of Harvard’s AI in Medicine initiative, and Raymond H. Mak, a radiation oncologist at DFCI and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, have spearheaded efforts to apply artificial intelligence to the BLCS dataset.
In a recent study published in the Lancet Digital Health, joint last authors Aerts and Mak applied AI algorithms to CT scans of BLCS patients. Their study tested the ability of the algorithms to identify and outline tumors and cancer-affected lymph nodes on the scans. This is a task usually performed by radiation oncologists — physicians who specialize in administering radiation therapy — but it is a labor-intensive process subject to error and inconsistency between physicians.
To outline cancerous tissue, a CT scanner first captures dozens of two-dimensional images of the patient’s lungs. The radiation oncologist then circles the images of tumors in each of those images.
“The normal workflow is these doctors — radiation oncologists that train for five years — manually draw on each individual axial image, So slice by slice, draw where the tumor is,” Mak says.
With the help of AI, Aerts and Mak saw an opportunity to dramatically reduce the time it takes to complete this task, while potentially improving consistency.
In the study, the researchers asked eight radiation oncologists to edit previously-outlined lung CT scans. For the majority of scans, the AI algorithm had outlined the tumors, while doctors had manually outlined tumors on the rest. The scientists discovered that radiation oncologists performed faster when editing AI-outlined scans as compared to human-outlined scans. The radiation oncologists also showed more consistent results between their final outlines when editing scans from the AI.
As Aerts and Mak’s study shows, one of the most powerful applications of AI is in synthesizing data so that doctors can more efficiently diagnose and treat patients using the processed data.
“I think AI can play an enormous role,” Aerts says. “You’re really thinking about better linking all the data together, so that the physician can much more quickly make decisions.”
Aerts and Mak are also applying AI to other questions in lung cancer research. For example, a patient with low muscle mass is more likely to experience toxic side effects from chemotherapy. The researchers are developing algorithms to detect fat and muscle mass on scans in order to predict a patient’s response to the treatment.
Despite the diverse capabilities of AI in medicine, Aerts and Mak acknowledge its limitations. On an “AI fact sheet” for the tumor-outlining algorithm, the researchers warn that the algorithm may fail to capture tumors less than one centimeter long. They also note the lack of racial diversity in the dataset, which may bias the algorithm.
Despite this, the patient dataset still provides millions of variables in genetic and environmental factors. Other studies by Christiani and his colleagues have used this data to make breakthroughs in personalized medicine — when a patient’s personal information is used to optimize treatment — outside of artificial intelligence.
In 2004, for example, Christiani and his colleagues used the BLCS data to test the efficacy of the lung cancer drug gefitinib for specific subsets of patients.
The results showed that gefitinib inhibited cancer growth by blocking a protein on the surface of cells called EGFR. This study led to the approval of gefitinib for usage in cancer patients with certain EGFR mutations. But it would not have been possible without the patients, tumor samples, and blood samples from the BLCS cohort, Christiani says.
Xinan Wang, a postdoctoral researcher working with Christiani at the School of Public Health, has looked at personalized lung cancer treatment under a different variable: smoking history.
Wang took advantage of BLCS’ rich dataset, which ranges from packs per day to years spent smoking, to analyze how smoking history affects an individual’s response to immunotherapy, a treatment approach that trains a patient’s immune system to recognize foreign or mutant proteins on cancer cells.
“Contradictory to common sense, patients who have a longer history of smoking or who’ve been a more intense smoker tend to have better clinical outcomes of immunotherapy,” Wang says. The researchers hypothesize that severe smoking leads to damaged cells with a higher quantity of mutant proteins. These mutant proteins make it easier to train the body’s immune cells to identify cancer cells.
But in using BLCS’ dataset, Wang, Christiani, and their collaborators are limited by the cohort’s lack of ethnic and racial diversity. This has created a challenge for Wang, for example, who is now looking at how ethnic ancestry affects a patient’s likelihood for having certain cancer-relevant mutations. Diversifying the data set could “potentially provide us the opportunity to learn more disparity issues around lung cancer and lung cancer patients’ survival outcomes,” Wang says.
Wang hopes more patients from different backgrounds will join the data set: “We definitely want to see more patients from the minority to join in the cohort, and we want to see more patients from different parts of the world.”

OnlyBans’ hot pink homepage illuminates the dark square of my dorm room. Smooth techno music streams out of my laptop speakers: sort of sci-fi, sort of catwalk. I navigate to the sidebar menu, where I click a link that brings me to the game’s instructions. The words on the webpage are white and tiny like bleached teeth. It reads:
“Make money by:
Posting photos that attract new paying fans
Earning tips
Avoid:
Having your identity stolen or revealed
Having your account shut down
Stalkers and harassment”
Although I have the option to choose my own screen name, I opt for the alias assigned to me: @QTPieslice. A text pop-up explains that my goal is to make $200 in six weeks to pay my gas and water bills. I earn $10 per fan, plus extra from tips.
From there, I am brought to a grid of nine photos and asked to choose one to post on my page. There are some models posing in miniskirts and thigh-highs, others lifting their muscle tanks and pulling at their boxers, faceless bodies in bright bikini underwear. I go for a photo of a topless figure with a Teletubby in their lap. In the sidebar menu, my balance climbs.
As I move through the game — posting pictures, dodging censors, and connecting with other sex workers — I notice a recurring figure. Behind my pop-ups and chat logs, I see short, looped clips of the same woman: rifling through her wallet, applying sparkly lipgloss, posing in front of her webcam.
This is Lena Chen ’09: the performance artist who spearheaded the creation of OnlyBans in collaboration with computer scientist Maggie Oates. According to Chen’s website, the purpose of the project is to “empathetically teach people about digital surveillance and discrimination faced by sex workers.”
Chen argues that sex workers helped popularize the internet through chatrooms and pornography. Once the internet went mainstream, however, tech corporations turned on them. Despite facing policing and censorship, sex workers continue to play an integral role in the internet’s development. As Chen put it in an interview, “the internet was essentially built by sex and desire,” paraphrasing writer Gabriella Garcia.
The complicated, ever-changing relationship between sex and the internet has been one of the most influential forces of Chen’s career. She first came to national attention in 2006 through her blog Sex and the Ivy, which documented her sex life as a Harvard undergraduate. In 2007, an ex-boyfriend leaked Chen’s nudes, leading to years of stalking, doxxing, and online harassment. Struggling to cope with the trauma of the incident, Chen moved to Berlin in 2012. There, she worked as a nude model and began exploring performance art. Now, Chen is a Ph.D. candidate in Performance Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and her artwork continues to engage with the nexus of desire and the digital world.
I am 19 years old: the same age as Chen when she started Sex and the Ivy. I know that my online experience — characterized by curated Instagram carousels and choppy thoughts on Twitter — is different from Chen’s late-2000s landscape of long-form blogs.
Still, I can’t help but feel that Chen’s work is quasi-prophetic. In the candid, conversational tone of Sex and the Ivy, I see early traces of the casually confessional behavior that pervades social media today. In the intimacy of Chen’s performance art, I see the nascent question of what desire, care, and closeness can look like in an increasingly online world. Chen is an artist who speaks into the future: the future of sex, the future of technology, the future that implicates everyone interacting on the internet.
After its inception, Sex and the Ivy quickly gained attention from the media. In an op-ed published in The Crimson, Lucy M. Caldwell ’09 decried Chen’s lifestyle as “morally reprehensible.” Gawker included Chen on a list of “compulsive oversharers.” The Boston Phoenix described Chen as an “intellectualized Carrie Bradshaw,” while Newsweek preferred to think of her as the poster girl for “brainy girls gone wild.”
Despite the controversy she garnered, Chen does not think of Sex and the Ivy as something that was particularly novel. Instead, she thinks of her blog as one work in an extensive canon of confessional writing.
“This specific style of women’s memoir has been around for a really long time,” she says. “I think perhaps because it is speaking about women's experiences, it's often not taken very seriously. It’s not considered a source of literary merit or cultural value.”
She admits that not many confessional blogs discussed sex as openly as hers, but she insists that she was not alone; at the time, she says, many other young college-aged women were writing about sex in college paper columns, or, like Chen, on their own online platforms.
“It was exciting to see other women writing about very personal experiences and very taboo topics,” she says.
Although I was too young to read the blogs of Chen and her contemporaries when they were active, personal essays by women were some of the first writings that I connected with as a preteen. I remember poring over the “Live Through This” section of Rookie Magazine, bookmarking pieces about first periods, secret boyfriends, and burgeoning sexuality. At that age, my changing body felt frightening and uncontrollable, and the vulnerability I found in those essays reminded me that I was not alone.
For all of the empathy inspired by confessional essays, some argue that the popularity of personal writing profits off of women’s pain. “There is a danger of veering into the area of trauma porn, right? Where it's like, ‘What is the worst thing that ever happened to you? Write about that, commodify it,’” Chen says.
She mentions xoJane, the now-defunct women’s magazine from the early 2010s that was known for its revealing first-person narratives. The infamous “It Happened to Me” section included essays like “My Friend Joined ISIS,” “My Former Friend’s Death Was a Blessing,” and “My Gynecologist Found a Ball of Cat Hair in My Vagina.” xoJane was often accused of running intimate yet inflammatory articles for the sake of clicks and page views.
Chen had to weigh the costs and benefits of writing about her story in magazines in the aftermath of her experience with revenge porn.
“On one hand, it was good that I was able to have a chance to represent my own point of view because so much had been said about me without my involvement,” Chen says. “But on the other hand, I was making maybe a few hundred dollars. If you write one of the most popular articles for some site, and you’re getting paid a few hundred dollars, is that really a fair amount when you're also having to deal with a lot of emotional stuff?”
“What else are you doing to take care of yourself? Because that can’t be it,” she adds.
Chen’s confessional writing speaks to the way we present ourselves on social media today. The content of Sex and the Ivy, which was considered scandalous in the late 2000s, now strikes me as commonplace. Chen’s comments on her sex life and struggles with depression seem like lengthier versions of the candid one-liners that punctuate my Twitter feed. On Instagram, I scroll past thirsty selfies and unhinged captions without pause. Private and public life commingle on my touchscreen: the “morally reprehensible” has become the mundane.
“At the time, it wasn’t common for people to have a social media presence the way that we do now, right? It was very weird for a lot of my friends to see that I could get recognized on the street because I was writing a blog,” Chen explains.
“A really common criticism at the time was also like, ‘Lena, or these women, are just doing this for attention. Why are you putting so much of your life online?’” Chen says. “You wouldn’t hear those criticisms today, because it’s so ubiquitous, the way that people document their lives. And also what was considered oversharing back then — you know, the standards have changed.”
After graduating from Harvard, Chen settled in Boston, writing and organizing around the issues of sex education and feminist activism. During this time, she was approached by several literary agents for her work on Sex and the Ivy. “There were opportunities that were open to me,” she recalls.
Still, the fallout from Chen’s experience with revenge porn followed her into her new life.
“I was still super traumatized. I didn’t know how to handle being a public figure. And I was still being continually stalked by all these crazy people on the internet, who were not just making my life difficult, but making it difficult for my friends and my partner at the time to live their lives,” Chen says. “I never felt physically endangered, but I certainly didn't feel safe.”
“I was in a constant state of being worried that I was going to be attacked,” remembers Chen. “I had horrible sleep hygiene. I never felt like I could truly rest or let my guard down. When that happens over a longer period of time, like years, you start to break down. You’re just not able to function anymore.”
Chen discovered a means of escape when she visited Berlin in the summer of 2010. “I loved it. It felt like a really open city — like, creatively open,” she says.
“I don’t want to make Berlin into some ideal utopia, because I think a lot of people end up there and then fall into a ketamine hole from which they never recover,” Chen says. “It can be a dark place with a lot of lost souls. But, you know, me at the time, being a lost soul at the time, I felt this kind of kinship.”
Three years later, Chen and her partner moved to the city. There, Chen adopted the identity of “Elle Peril.” On one hand, Chen’s decision to abandon her identity was spurred by desperation. “It was very much an escape from the life that I was living,” she says.
At the same time, living as Elle Peril was an exercise in agency. After her experience with revenge porn, Chen felt powerless. “I didn’t have any control over how the other images had been distributed,” she says.
Nowadays, revenge porn is more commonly recognized as a deeply violating practice, especially in the context of a series of celebrity nude leaks and high-profile suicides. However, when Chen’s nudes were exposed in 2008, she lacked the language to describe the way she had been harmed. Elle Peril was her way of coming to terms with what had happened to her, her way of recovering from a heinous, nameless crime.
Nude modeling as Elle Peril provided a structured environment in which Chen could face her fears. “That was my way of creating a scenario, a very defined scenario in which I could interact with men, be super vulnerable in a certain way, and then leave,” she says.
I saw this paradox of vulnerability and autonomy play out in “The Life and Death of Elle Peril” — a performative reading based on Chen’s experiences as a nude model. In the video recording, Chen wears a black mini-dress, standing before a small audience on a quiet, tree-lined street. She reads from a stack of copy paper, chronicling her flight from the United States and her years spent in Berlin. Every few minutes, Chen pauses to remove a piece of clothing. By the end of the video, she is completely naked.
“The Life and Death of Elle Peril” isn’t just confessional: it’s creative. Each line is carefully crafted, and Chen delivers them in a clear, commanding tone. I am watching a woman strip as she tells her life story. I am also watching an artist take control of her work.
Vulnerability continues to play an important role in Chen’s performance art. “I'm interested in how the framework of performance art can actually act as a way for us to access something very real, something that’s very hidden. Sometimes, something hidden just beneath the surface for which we don’t access in our everyday lives,” she says.
In one piece, entitled “Nurture,” Chen breastfed members of the public while inviting them to talk about their experiences with motherhood. One man confessed that he had not been held by anyone since the death of his grandmother. One woman — a mother herself — admitted that she never felt cared for, even though she was constantly taking care of other people.
“These moments are taking place in the context of a performance, right?” Chen says. “But there’s still very real emotions that are surfacing.”
As she developed her artistic practice, Chen found a way to deal with the dizzying bursts of intimacy inspired by her performances. “To prevent yourself from taking on other people’s trauma, and let’s say emotional residue, you kind of have to be another person when you’re performing than who you are in real life,” she says. She separates Performance Lena from Real Lena: her detachment facilitates closeness.
Chen says that the use of personas — of alternate names, alternate identities — is something that performance art and sex work have in common. “Every sex worker I know has a different professional alias,” she says.
She acknowledges that many sex workers use aliases because of the stigma and criminalization of their profession. At the same time, Chen argues that an alias can help both artists and sex workers find agency. “By taking on this other persona, it can give you power, I think,” Chen says. “It’s not that you're a different person, because it’s still you. We all contain multitudes, right? We are just drawing upon a different aspect of ourselves, a different archetype. An image of who we want to be or could be. And we’re using that to empower ourselves.”
I think about @QTPieslice and OnlyBans, about the contradiction of posting intimate photos under a made-up name. In a way, this contradiction underlies my online life. In middle school, I posted angsty short stories to online forums under a cheesy screen name. Bored out of my mind during quarantine, I drifted into anonymous chatrooms, making up an identity for the men that tried to talk to me, listening to their perverted fantasies and leaving when they asked me to play along. Some of my friends indulge in r/AmItheAsshole, a subreddit where users admit their sins under usernames like u/jimothyisyouruncle and u/AnonymousMeese. Others run inscrutable spam accounts with celebrity profile pictures. In this way, the internet acts as a confessional: your identity is obscured, but your personal revelations ring clear.
This paradoxical nature of online intimacy has informed Chen’s work as well as her personal life. Revenge porn, at least in its current form, would not exist without technology. Yet Chen first found her audience on blogs and online magazines. Healing and harm coexist with one another, forming the double helix of Chen’s digital world.
Through OnlyBans and her upcoming projects, Chen will continue to make art “about how all of us experience intimacy in this particular technological age.”
In the process of developing OnlyBans, Chen ran workshops where she asked people to conceptualize an internet where “your presence on the internet was welcomed, and it felt like a safe place for you, and you had control over the ways in which you express yourself.”
Chen tells me that her utopian internet is a value-neutral space.
“For me, the ideal internet is less about the internet itself. It’s about how we use it,” she says. “How can we be more present in the moment itself? And how can technology facilitate that presence, rather than distract us from it?”

In my final months of high school, I would sometimes open my laptop and do some online window-shopping during class. I had a Google Drive folder — titled “prefrosh fun >:D” — containing wishlists of clothes and dorm decorations alongside inventories of courses and potential concentrations. The clothes, like the concentrations, felt like signs of my future: a glimpse at who I could become once I moved to college.
At some point, I stumbled upon a tennis skirt from Los Angeles Apparel. On the website, bored-looking models posed in color-blocked clothing against a white background, and at the bottom of the webpage was a “Featured on Instagram” tab. Under the subtitle was a carousel of women posing in parks, apartments, and strip malls in every color of the brand’s tennis skirts. All of the photos were bright, grainy, and sexy in a way that seemed effortless.
The persona I had built for myself in high school was defined by good grades and raw ambition. Although I credit my nerdy, overachieving behavior with getting me into Harvard, it also blanketed me in a blob of sexlessness for almost all of my adolescence. My perceived plainness was compounded by my race. Growing up as a person of color in a white, conservative suburb of Texas, I was marked as ugly before I even knew what beauty meant.
Committing to Harvard felt liberating to me. In a student body full of nerdy overachievers, I no longer had to make academics my sole selling point. On a liberal campus far more diverse than my hometown (though still predominantly white), I thought my race would no longer be a burden. I could slough off my old, undesirable self and become anyone I wanted to be.
When the tennis skirt came in the mail, I felt like I had received the first piece of my new personality. Los Angeles Apparel was selling me a piece of overpriced clothing, but they were also selling me the chance to become one of the women on their Instagram page: reclining in a short skirt and spaghetti-strapped tank top, a lilac sunset framing my silhouette.
***
Los Angeles Apparel is the reincarnation of American Apparel, its far more popular predecessor from the mid-2000s. American Apparel’s ads sold sex unashamedly. Their billboards displayed faceless women in thigh highs, topless women in technicolor tights, women on white bedsheets with their legs splayed open. American Apparel’s aesthetic garnered controversy, but it also made the label one of the most popular clothing brands of its time.
American Apparel was one facet of indie sleaze fashion. The subculture — characterized by flash photography, wired-in headphones, grungy, indulgent clothing, and lamé everything — was a hedonistic response to the Great Recession, resisting the cleanliness and curation that marked that era. Now, indie sleaze is experiencing a renaissance. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and a rollback on social freedoms in the United States and United Kingdom, adopting the indie sleaze aesthetic feels like dressing for a party at the end of the world.
I love the cluttered, mismatched eroticism of indie sleaze. That said, I think the messiness of the movement runs deeper than sweat and smudged eyeliner. Cultural critics who lived through the first wave of indie sleaze recall how the opulence of the subculture was built atop rail-thin beauty standards and rampant misogyny.
Dov Charney, the founder of American Apparel and Los Angeles Apparel, could arguably be called the architect of indie sleaze. He pioneered the direct flash photography and the bright, sordid sexiness that came to define the subculture.
Charney also had a reputation for being a massive creep. American Apparel’s decline began with a series of lawsuits leveled against Charney, accusing him of sexual harassment. Although Charney was never found guilty, he was ousted from his role as the CEO of American Apparel, and the company swiftly went bankrupt.
Two years after his fall from grace, Charney started Los Angeles Apparel, a quiet copycat of his original brand. In recent years, Los Angeles Apparel has experienced a surge in popularity alongside the resurgence of indie sleaze. The brand’s Instagram account — full of washed-out, filmy photos — now has over 159,000 followers — including me.
***
Since coming to college, I have amassed a collection of tennis skirts from Los Angeles Apparel. Sometimes, I try to make excuses for my wardrobe decisions — besides, doesn’t everyone I know, regardless of their progressive ideals, still shop from Amazon? Still, I can’t shake the fact that my love for Los Angeles Apparel opposes my self-professed feminist politics. When I add another tennis skirt to my shopping cart, I line the pockets of a man who built his career on the degradation of women.
I could stop shopping from Los Angeles Apparel, but I’m not sure if I could ever escape the contradiction of holding feminist convictions while trying to survive as a woman in the world. Femininity has never felt natural to me. Whenever I shave my legs or curl my hair or wear makeup, I don’t feel “empowered” or “good about myself,” as countless beauty magazines have told me I should. When I doll myself up, I’m not chasing an amorphous sense of self-satisfaction — I’m trying to secure social capital.
Like many women, I’m hyper-aware of how my appearance influences my treatment by society. Since I hit puberty, I have been treated more kindly by the world when I make an effort to be prettier and more palatable. This phenomenon is what the writer and activist Janet Mock calls pretty privilege: “the societal advantages, often unearned, that benefit people who are perceived as pretty or considered beautiful.” Beauty, of course, often aligns with societal standards of acceptability. By being cis, able-bodied, and relatively thin, I meet some of these standards, and pretty privilege is conferred to me without any effort on my part. At the same time, my race sets me at a disadvantage in a Eurocentric system.
Although it comes with societal benefits, I don’t want to conflate prettiness with power. During his tenure at American Apparel, Dov Charney would select his models by thumbing through application photographs and selecting the women that appealed to him. Prettiness is at the mercy of male desire — and I am intimately familiar with the ways that women are punished for failing to maintain beauty.
For most of my life, I was told that I was ugly and unfuckable. I spent years swimming in baggy t-shirts and crying in fitting rooms, constantly at war with my body. For this reason, I don’t entirely fault myself for aspiring to the laidback, lo-fi sexiness advertised by Los Angeles Apparel. Though personal choice is not above scrutiny, I struggle to fault any woman for chasing the capital that comes with prettiness, no matter how compromised that capital may be.
I long to be the type of woman with a pure moral compass, if such a woman even exists. I don’t want to hand my money to faceless CEOs in a conference room, whether that CEO is Dov Charney or the men who run almost every major razor company, lingerie label, and beauty brand. But at the end of the day, I know I will wear my tiny tennis skirts to parties, because I crave the capital that comes with being a desirable woman. I will wear makeup to all of my job interviews, because I know beauty will help me get what I want.
***
The other day, I started scrolling through Instagram stories while I was procrastinating writing a paper. On Los Angeles Apparel’s story, I saw a call for new models — no experience required. My thumb pinned the story to my screen, freezing the ad like digital taxidermy.
I could never model for Los Angeles Apparel. I am neither tall nor model-skinny, and I know of too many family members that would die of shame if they saw me posing in a lamé string bikini. Still, in that moment, I reveled in the fantasy of my body, framed by the brand’s Instagram account, awash in the camera flash and its white light.

The Massachusetts House is considering a bill that would require higher education institutions like Harvard to pay a fee for admissions processes that consider legacy status or relationships to donors or that include an early decision plan.
Co-filed by Massachusetts State Rep. Simon Cataldo and State Senator Pavel M. Payano, the bill would require all higher education institutions in the state to disclose information about their admissions processes and would charge institutions a “public service fee” proportional to the size of their endowment for policies that violate its guidelines.
The bill was also co-sponsored by Massachusetts State Reps. Samantha Montaño, Francisco E. Paulino, Carmine Lawrence Gentile, David H.A. LeBoeuf ’13, James K. Hawkins, Sean Garballey, Patrick Joseph Kearney, and Danillo A. Sena. LeBoeuf is a former Crimson News editor.
For Payano, the motivation for the proposed bill is “ensuring that the higher ed application process for private schools is done in an equitable manner.”
“These practices are unfair, and they prevent working-class, hardworking students from being able to have access to these types of opportunities that are life-changing not for themselves, but for their entire family,” Payano said.
The revenue from the public service fee would fund select Massachusetts community colleges. According to the plan outlined in the bill, Harvard would have to pay 0.2 percent of its endowment to continue considering legacy status in admissions, or about $100 million a year.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the proposed legislation.
“If the bill goes into place, we think it creates about 25,000 slots of free community college,” Cataldo said. “If the schools decide to continue using these pernicious practices, that public service fee that goes into place would create opportunity for the very students that the schools are systematically keeping out of their campuses.”
“Community colleges, unlike many elite colleges and universities, put students in the jobs that are needed most in Massachusetts,” he added.
The proposed bill comes ahead of a Supreme Court ruling on the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions’ lawsuit against Harvard, which is expected to overturn race-based affirmative action in universities’ admissions processes nationwide.
Massachusetts State Rep. Samantha Montaño, who is co-sponsoring the bill, said it would act as a “counterbalance” for diversity if affirmative action is overturned, describing it as a “valiant effort to address inequities in our private institutions.”
Cataldo said the Supreme Court case presents an “opportunity” for Harvard to “think creatively” about equity in their admissions practices.
“Legacy preference and donor relations preference have no place in an equitable or fair admission scheme, with or without race-based affirmative action,” Cataldo said.
Montaño, whose district comprises several neighborhoods in Boston, said the effort would be “probably a huge battle” given the expected pushback from universities targeted by the legislation.
“When we talk about taxing wealthy institutions or people, it’ll be the same issue where they just pour money into stopping it,” she said.

Former U.S. Senator Phil Gramm discussed the complexities of measuring American inequality at a Harvard Kennedy School talk moderated by former University president Lawrence H. Summers on Wednesday afternoon.
The event was hosted by the Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, where Summers serves as director.
During the event, Gramm — a former Republican Senator from Texas — said his research challenges traditional views of inequality and underscores the necessity for improved measurement approaches.
Gramm began by lauding Summers — with whom he worked when Summers was Secretary of the Treasury under former U.S. President Bill Clinton — and what he called Summers’ resolve to challenge “conventional wisdom,” describing him as “the most credible economist in the American post-war period.”
Gramm continued that he himself has also been challenging convention in his current research, and he questioned the accuracy of the economic statistics currently used to measure well-being.
“For about 20 years, I have found myself marveling how the fundamental economic statistics of the country seem to be at such great variance with a world that I live in,” he said.
“The Census Bureau counts only about one-third of transfer payments as income to the people who receive the transfer payments for people in the bottom 20 percent of income earners,” Gramm added. “They don’t count food stamps. They don’t count Medicaid, what government pays for your health care. They don’t count rent subsidies, where government pays your rent. They don’t count refundable tax credits.”
Gramm’s recent research found that “if you count all transfer payments and taxes,” the poverty rate is 2.5 percent.
“Actually, income inequality is lower today, very slightly lower than what it was in 1947,” he said.
Gramm said the largest contributor to income inequality is the decision to have a job, followed by the quality of one’s education.
“The biggest cause of income inequality is the decision to work or not work,” Gramm said. “The second cause, as my mother would say, how sharp are your tools, how much education do you have and how good is it?”
“The economy is an escalator and if you don’t get on the escalator, you don’t move up,” he added.
The former senator also emphasized the importance of reaching a consensus on the numbers used in public policy debates on inequality. Gramm pointed out that although the U.S. Census Bureau releases supplemental poverty rates, which incorporate some of the transfers Gramm advocates to be included in the official poverty rate, the official poverty rate remains the number cited in political discourse.
“All I’m saying is that I just want to get the numbers straight so that when we’re debating, we’re debating the same thing. We’re not talking past each other,” he said.
Summers talked about some common threads in the debate, including a “clear agreement that the official poverty line substantially overstates poverty.”
In closing remarks, Gramm asked his audience how to “prevent people from dropping out of the labor market and therefore out of economy and giving up the American dream.”
“I’ll just conclude by saying that one of my frustrations in my 25 years in government is, we never found a way to help people help themselves without destroying their incentive to help themselves,” Gramm said.
“Mobility is alive and well in America,” he added. “In any other country in the world, it would be a Golden Age.”
Correction: April 6, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that former Harvard University president Lawrence H. Summers was a member of the Harvard College Class of 1982. In fact, Summers received his undergraduate degree from MIT and completed his Ph.D. at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1982.

Harvard Medical School associate professor Brittany M. Charlton discussed reproductive health care disparities experienced by sexual and gender minority women at a Harvard School of Public Health seminar Wednesday.
Sexual and gender minority populations encompass LGBTQ+ people or others who are nonbinary or do not self-identify as specific sexual orientations or gender identities.
Charlton is affiliated with the Center for Population and Development Studies and serves as the co-director of Harvard Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression Health Equity Research Collaborative. This event is the fourth installment of HSPH’s Center for Population and Development Studies’ population research exchange series, which aims to present population science topics through seminars, workshops, and information sessions.
Charlton began the lecture by explaining the research challenges relating to the reproductive health of LGBTQ+ patients. These difficulties include limitations in sampling — such as small or “convenient” samples — exclusion of children and adolescents, and a lack of specialized researchers in the field.
Charlton said she and her team overcame these barriers by using large national prospective cohort studies, such as the Nurses’ Health Study — which investigates chronic diseases in women — and the Growing Up Today Study — a longitudinal cohort super-study on a wide range of health issues. Charlton helped lead both of these initiatives.
Presenting her research findings, Charlton said “structural stigma” has led to reproductive health disparities in sexual minority women.
“It can include things like discriminatory laws, same-sex marriage bans. Those really adversely impact the reproductive health of sexual minorities above and beyond that of their heterosexual peers,” Charlton said.
As a result of these causal factors, she said, sexual minority women are “twice as likely to have had a sexually transmitted infection” and are “more likely to have an unintended pregnancy.”
Charlton’s research shows that for every one cisgender and heterosexual woman who becomes pregnant as a result of sexual assault and rape, about 10 LGBTQ+ people experience the same.
Charlton said she and her colleagues at Harvard SOGIE have aimed to educate others on these disparities in order to mitigate them.
Charlton’s team develops and implements programs in the medical education field. One such program is a training that teaches faculty to cultivate a more inclusive and safe learning environment.
Harvard SOGIE also created a model to help faculty mentor sexual and gender minority people.
“We know that quality mentorship needs a whole host of things, whether that’s an increased sense of belonging or activity. Unfortunately most of us learn how to mentor by trial and error,” Charlton said.
Charlton added that there were no mentor training programs for LGBTQ+ health professionals at the time the model was constructed; however, she said a pilot of her team’s mentoring program last spring was a success.
Despite the ongoing work of LGBTQ+ health researchers, Charlton still believes there is much work to be done to reduce disparities. She concluded her talk with a call to action for health care professionals, researchers, and legislators, citing the current political climate and persistent violence toward LGBTQ+ people and allies.
“We are seeing a completely unprecedented and coordinated attack primarily on our pediatricians who are providing gender affirming care,” Charlton said, referencing a September 2022 protest against the nation’s first pediatric and adolescent transgender health program at Boston Children’s Hospital.
“We’ve really got to puff up our chests and really just not back down from this work,” Charlton added.

Harvard students celebrated Trans Day of Visibility on March 31, attending a series of events during the week to honor the experiences of transgender people and raise awareness to the challenges they face.
The events included a “TransQuinceañera,” information stations at the Office for BGLTQ student life, the opportunity to write letters to trans children, Q&A sessions with individuals to amplify the experiences of those who identify as trans, and documentary screenings.
Meagan von Rohr, the assistant director of the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, hosted open hours at the BGLTQ office — also known as the QuOffice — in the days leading up to Trans Day of Visibility. These conversations, open to students across the University, included discussions on advocating for trans rights, allyship, and amplifying the voices of trans students.
“We also have stations where people can learn how to contact their elected officials,” von Rohr said in an interview last week. “We encourage folks to do that if they are comfortable with it. It is a little bit of an American focus because that’s where we are right now.”
Von Rohr said trans people in the U.S. currently face an array of difficulties and barriers, referencing more than 300 anti-trans bills across 44 states.
“They’re being legislated against and they’re not a huge part of our population nationally,” they added.
Amber M. Simons ’26, the co-president of the newly formed Harvard Undergraduate Queer Advocates, said administrators — including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — attended events and stations at the QuOffice.
Hannah L. Niederriter ’26, the secretary of HUQAD and an organizer of the Trans Day of Visibility programming, said organizers invited administrators to help them connect with trans students on a personal level.
“We really wanted to just make them feel like they felt included and that we were listening to their concerns and that we were actively trying to make a difference for the betterment of their communities,” Niederriter said.
“We wanted to show that admin was also willing to learn and take steps to improve conditions not only on campus, but just in general for the trans community,” she added. “They get to demonstrate their support and see where they could improve.”
Simons said students can become engaged with fighting anti-trans legislation and supporting trans people not only on Trans Day of Visibility, but “throughout the year.”
“It is a really difficult time to be gender non-comforming or trans or gender diverse, and it doesn’t need to be,” von Rohr said. “I just want them to know that we’re here for them at the QuOffice.”
Harvard affiliates gathered at Adams House on April 1 for a festive TransQuinceañera, which featured dancing, a documentary screening, and a performance. The event was held in honor of Trans Day of Visibility and Women’s History Month, which is celebrated throughout April.
Michael Ángel R. Vázquez, a resident tutor at Adams and a member of the Latinx Student Association and LGBTQ Association at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said the evening was “an act of gratitude” and an opportunity to support “our trans siblings.”
The event featured activist, artist, and educator Lía García, who gave a performance and discussed healing and visibility as a trans woman. According to Vázquez, the event was initially planned for April 2020, but it was postponed for three years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We can talk about the difficulties that queer and trans people face, in particular trans people,” Vázquez said. “But we can do it from a point of beauty and goodness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston City Council last month passed a rent control measure to limit annual rent increases to 10 percent, advancing a proposal drafted by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 to the State Legislature.
The measure’s passage fulfills a key promise of Wu’s campaign platform to bring back rent control in Boston after multiple failed attempts over previous decades. It also comes amid a long-running shortage of sufficient and affordable housing in Massachusetts: Boston currently has one of the highest rates of rent burden — defined as spending 30 percent or more of one’s income on rent — among tenants in the United States.
Massachusetts State Rep. Mike L. Connolly, whose district includes parts of East Cambridge and Somerville, said in an interview that there is a need for the policy.
“We’ve been in a state of affordable housing emergency really for over two decades now,” he said. “Today, a more accurate way to describe the housing issues that we face are that this is a disaster.”
“We have never seen the level of homelessness that we now see in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,” Connolly added. “We’ve never seen the kind of cost burden that faces renters.”
Boston saw several periods of rent control in the city throughout the 20th century before a 1994 ballot initiative finally banned the practice across Massachusetts. The statewide ban’s success came despite majority opposition from the three Massachusetts cities — Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline — that had active rent control policies in place at the time.
As a result of the act, municipalities must now file home rule petitions if they want to regulate rent and evictions. Since then, multiple efforts in both Boston and Cambridge to file such a petition have been defeated either by voters, the mayor, or the city council.
Now in the throes of a housing crisis, a majority of Boston residents still appear to support some degree of rent control for their city. Approximately 68 percent of likely voters showed support for this new rent control plan, according to a statewide poll conducted by Northwind Strategies, a public affairs firm.
Shelley Hallman, a Cambridge resident who works in Harvard Square, said she believes local governments in the area should be doing more to address the problem.
“I hear a lot of kids when I’m walking down the street in Cambridge, talking about they graduated school, they landed a job but they still cannot afford to rent an apartment — that’s just frustrating, to hear kids saying that,” she said.
Despite the favorable polls from local residents, uncertainty remains over the bill’s prospects in the State House. Connolly called the bill’s passage an “uphill battle,” pointing out that “legislative leaders have yet to offer support.”
Massachusetts State Rep. Robert Consalvo, whose district comprises several southern neighborhoods in Boston, said in an interview that this was partly because the bill was still in an early stage of the legislative process.
“We’re at the literally top of the first inning of a nine-inning game,” Cosalvo said about the bill, which has yet to have a hearing. He added that he had not yet heard much from his constituents.
“Our job is to vet — the process is deliberately hard,” he added. “We want to make sure we’re being thorough. We want to make sure we’re being transparent.”
Nonetheless, Consalvo noted that rent control, passed or not, would be just one part of a wider approach to the housing crisis, a position similarly taken by Wu.
“It’s only one small piece of the pie,” he said, listing separate efforts the legislature was taking to address housing issues in the state, including hundreds of millions in budget appropriations for rental assistance and a proposed tenant protection bill.
Chris Herbert, managing director of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and a member of Wu’s Rent Stabilization Advisory Committee, likened the measure to “anti-gouging legislation,” describing it as mild enough to avoid realizing some of the more common concerns around rent control.
“If you limit rents to a 10 percent increase on an annual basis, that leaves tremendous room for landlords to increase rents over time in a way that I think will be minimally, if at all, distorting of the market,” Herbert said. “Rents in Boston have not increased in any given year by nearly that amount.”
Hallman, the Cambridge resident, said she believes rent gouging practices are a major contributor to the housing crisis and should not be permitted.
“I don’t think corporations should be able to buy up apartment buildings and continue to raise the rent,” she said. “It’s just all for profit.”
“They don’t care who can afford it,” Hallman added, describing a significant rent increase she had faced the year before. “As long as they’re making more money: more, more, more, more money.”
She added that it was a “huge relief off my shoulders” when she found out her housing voucher was adjusted to help offset the cost of her higher rent.
Despite the moderate extent of the measure, the real estate industry has recently begun a campaign — led by the Greater Boston Real Estate Board — in opposition to Wu’s rent control plan. The board planned to spend approximately $400,000 at the beginning of the initiative to publicize their stance, yet the board shared willingness to invest more if the proposal were to advance to the State Legislature.
Still, Connolly said he hopes continued outreach to city residents will increase support for the proposal.
“It seems the more the public hears accurate information about what we’re talking about, that support only goes up,” Connolly said.
“I think we have to just continue doing advocacy — doing that outreach — as we prepare for legislative hearings that will take place this session on these bills,” Connolly added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Second-year law students Swap Agrawal and Tolu Alegbeleye have been elected co-presidents of the Harvard Law School Student Government for the 2023-24 academic year, the body announced in a March 30 email to students.
The Law School’s Student Government serves as “the student body’s voice to Dean Manning, Administration, and Faculty,” according to its website. The body’s responsibilities include allocating funds to student organizations, providing academic resources, and hosting events at the school.
In addition to the co-presidency, students voted on candidates for the director of student organizations, 3L representative, 2L representative, and S.J.D. representative positions. The body had four vacancies for the 3L and 2L positions, and one for the director of student organizations and S.J.D. role.
Agrawal and Alegbeleye campaigned on a platform to increase career and financial support for students pursuing public interest careers, provide resources to “make life at HLS easier,” and support student advocacy on campus, according to their campaign website.
In an interview, Agrawal and Alegbeleye said they ran for student office due to desire to “create positive change on campus.” Alegbeleye said she believes the HLS Student Government co-presidency puts the pair in a “really unique position” to enact change.
“We both acknowledged when we were running that student government doesn’t have a lot of formal power, but it does have the ability to reach literally everybody in the student body, which is something that none of the student orgs can do,” Alegbeleye said.
One goal for the pair’s tenure, according to Agrawal, is to address a concern that public interest careers “are inaccessible or feel inaccessible, at least, to a lot of people.”
“There are things that the University can do to correct that, whether that’s increasing front-end financial aid so that low-income and first-generation students are able to have more freedom with their career choices or improving the Low Income Protection program, which allows graduates who have a lot of debt to pursue lower paying careers by offering them loan assistance,” Agrawal said.
“Beyond that, there’s cultural things that the school can do by emphasizing more career advising,” he added.
Agrawal and Alegbeleye’s opponents for the co-presidency — M. Saeed Ahmad and Mohini Tangri — campaigned on better representation for the entire student body, including public interest-oriented students and religious groups.
Tangri said in an interview following the election results that she hopes to see a “public interest coalition” that would enable student activists to push for progress on multiple issues simultaneously.
Ahmad expressed hope about the turnout from the election but said he believes the HLS Student Government could still improve.
“One thing I do like was the increased participation we saw,” Ahmad said. “I think there can be more engagement with student government.”
First-year Law School student Vinny K. Byju ’20 — who was elected director of student organizations — said in an interview that he ran to improve the process of creating new student groups, following his own negative experience trying to form a new club.
According to Byju, his student organization’s application for a birdwatching club was denied this year after three months of no communication from the HLS Student Government.
This experience was shared by other applicants, according to Byju, who said he was left unsatisfied by the HLS Student Government’s response.
Byju said he wants to increase transparency in the student organization application process, adding that he does not understand why the process is “behind closed doors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Department Chief Victor A. Clay provided new details on the Monday armed raid by HUPD of an undergraduate suite in response to a false 911 call, writing in a Wednesday statement that the caller claimed to be a Harvard student who was “kicked out.”
The statement comes more than 48 hours after at least five armed HUPD officers raided the Leverett House suite of Harvard College seniors Jarah K. Cotton ’23, Jazmin N. Dunlap ’23, David G. Madzivanyika ’23, and Alexandra C. René ’23.
The students, who are Black, awoke to banging on their door and commands to “open up” at approximately 4:15 a.m. Monday. Officers wielding assault rifles and wearing riot gear identified themselves and entered the suite before ordering the students out of their rooms at gunpoint.
Clay wrote in the Wednesday statement that HUPD received three calls within an hour from a caller who “identified himself as male” and claimed to be a Harvard student who was “kicked out” this semester.
The caller claimed to have taken a woman hostage in the students’ suite and had unsuccessfully attempted to kill her, according to Clay. The caller referenced “a room number that indicated a strong familiarity with Leverett House and how its rooms are commonly referenced by Harvard community members,” Clay wrote.
The caller “indicated that he was armed” in the third call, Clay wrote in the statement, and first threatened to “shoot law enforcement who entered the room” and then to leave the room and “start shooting as he did so.” These phone calls led HUPD to believe there was an “elevated” threat.
HUPD called Cotton and René roughly 30 minutes before the raid, Cotton said in an interview Monday. When officers failed to contact the two students, HUPD “determined that it was necessary to enter the room” to ensure their safety, according to Clay.
The officers then searched the Leverett suite with “negative results for an individual with a firearm or any persons acting in a suspicious manner,” according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
After the situation was cleared, officers brought the students to a common room and briefed them on the reasons for their response, Clay wrote in the statement. At around 4:41 a.m., residential staff “began to engage with the students directly.”
The false 911 call was an instance of “swatting,” named for the armed SWAT teams that often respond to them. Swatting attacks have been on the rise, particularly in schools, across the country in recent weeks. NBC10 Boston reported that 28 Massachusetts communities received swatting calls the day following a March 27 school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee.
In a Wednesday statement, Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana wrote that other Boston-area universities had been targeted by similar swatting calls in the past week. MIT received a bomb threat at around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to Boston 25 News, prompting the evacuation of Simmons Hall, an undergraduate dormitory.
Swatting is a crime under Massachusetts state and federal law. Clay confirmed that an investigation into the false report is ongoing and that HUPD is working with the FBI on the matter.
In the aftermath of the raid, students and alumni expressed outrage over the raid and concern for the safety and well-being of the students, and six upperclassman houses issued statements to residents as of Wednesday evening. Harvard affiliates and the public criticized the delay of a University-wide response.
“We were all extremely scared, particularly because my roommates and I are Black students who have been bombarded our whole lives with stories and images portraying how situations such as this had ended up terribly,” Cotton wrote in a Monday statement to The Crimson. “We felt our lives were in danger. We are traumatized.”
Clay’s statement on Wednesday addressed concerns for the students but did not include an apology.
“​​We acknowledge that the presence of police officers in the early morning hours in one of the College’s residential Houses can, and in this case did, raise fears and anxiety,” Clay wrote. “Entering a residential House is not something that HUPD does without cause or takes lightly.”
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an email Tuesday that CPD was not informed of the raid when it occurred.
“We actually didn’t respond to that reported incident and will support HUPD and/or the FBI if/as assistance is needed,” Warnick wrote. “To clarify, we didn’t respond as the Cambridge Police were not notified.”
Clay’s email did not explain why the department did not send out a public alert to students despite the possibility of an active shooter.
“Clearly, they believed there was an active shooter on Harvard’s campus,” Cotton said in an interview Monday. “If there was a shooter in Dunster House, I would like to know in Leverett.”
“They clearly, again, thought it was a serious threat because they had assault rifles pointed at our faces,” Cotton added. “I feel like if it warrants that kind of response, it most definitely warrants an email.”
Catalano declined to comment Monday on the lack of an alert to campus.
“The steps taken by HUPD are aligned with law enforcement protocols, which HUPD officers are trained on,” Clay wrote Wednesday. “The steps we take are based on an assessment of the level of potential threat to members of our community with regards to a potential public safety situation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, administrators, and alumni condemned Monday’s early morning “swatting” attack, which saw at least five Harvard University Police Department officers enter a Leverett House suite with riot gear and assault rifles.
The officers, who were responding to a false 911 call about an armed individual in the dormitory, ordered the four students in the suite, who are Black, out of their rooms at gunpoint at approximately 4:15 a.m. Monday.
HUPD police chief Victor A. Clay wrote an update to undergraduates Wednesday evening, providing a timeline of the department’s response in greater detail. According to Clay, the caller claimed to be a student “kicked out” of Harvard who was armed and holding a woman hostage in the Leverett suite.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acknowledged the “deeply troubling” attack in an email to undergraduates Wednesday evening.
“Many members of our community are understandably scared, frustrated, angry, and upset that something like this could happen on Harvard’s campus,” Khurana wrote. “We understand that the implications, fears, and trauma of an incident like this land differently for the impacted students and for communities of color more broadly.”
The Harvard Black Students Association and Harvard Undergraduate Black Community Leaders wrote that they were “deeply troubled” by the attack in a joint statement Tuesday.
“We pledge to offer our unwavering support and do everything in our power to ensure that those affected by this injustice receive the assistance and resources they need,” the statement reads.
Kendra Davenport Cotton — the mother of Jarah K. Cotton ’23, one of the students living in the suite — wrote in a statement early Wednesday morning that she was dissatisfied by the University’s response.
“While I do not believe race to be a factor in the university’s response, my gut is telling me that the administration would have a different posture if these were students of means,” Davenport Cotton wrote.
University spokespeople Jonathan L. Swain and Jason A. Newton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
BCL co-chair Brian A. Cromwell Jr. ’23 said he desired more concrete action from Harvard, though he said Khurana’s statement — which came two days after the police raid occurred — “provided some clarity.”
“The delay in their response is worrisome and the solutions provided don’t directly address the safety of Black students on campus,” Cromwell said in an interview Wednesday evening. “We urge the University to take a more rigorous approach to meeting this goal.”
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Harvard Black Alumni Society also issued a statement Tuesday evening detailing the group’s reaction to the attack.
“HBAS is horrified and upset that Black students at Harvard endured such trauma in their own homes, where they should have been assured the utmost safety,” the statement reads.
HBAS President Monica M. Clark ’06 said while she understands the need for a swift police response, she would like to see Harvard more strongly consider student peace of mind.
“Some people have said, ‘Obviously, there’s been a lot of school shootings,’ and they understand why there might be a very forceful response given what’s going on,” Clark said. “I appreciate that and get that to a degree, but I still feel like there has to be some sort of balance between managing those kinds of risks and making sure students feel safe and comfortable in their home.”
“It just amplifies a fear that’s already in most Black people living in America,” she added.
The Harvard Undergraduate Association called the swatting attack “horrifying” in a statement on its Instagram page Wednesday evening, urging HUPD to “conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that justice is served.”
Prior to Khurana’s and Clay’s statements Wednesday evening, leaders from six undergraduate houses — Adams, Eliot, Kirkland, Leverett, Lowell, and Winthrop houses — acknowledged the swatting attack and offered support in emails to residents.
Lowell Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser and Resident Dean Annie Park co-signed a statement to residents Wednesday afternoon, where they characterized the attack as “hateful and deeply traumatizing.”
Eliot Faculty Deans Stephanie A. Paulsell and Kevin J. Madigan emailed residents Tuesday evening, writing, “It’s awful to think of this happening in the place we call home.”
“There are echoes in this incident of some of the most troubling aspects of life in this country — the epidemic of gun violence, the disproportionate weight of policing on communities of color,” Paulsell and Madigan wrote.

It’s April and by now, it should be hard to get through more than a few days without someone asking you what you’re doing this summer or where you’ll be this May, June, July and August. Are you studying abroad? Working for a startup? Taking summer classes? Doing research, shadowing, and volunteering this summer? Oh wait, I got it — it’s your consulting era. Doesn’t matter. Sometimes, no matter what you say, nothing really feels like the *perfect* answer to the dreaded question… So, what are you doing this summer?
Here are five excellent and honest ways to respond to this inescapable question, that may happen to be the most common responses you’ll hear on campus:
The Overcommitted and Unaware Student
That’s a great question. I’m so glad you asked. I am working at five internships simultaneously at the U.N., McKinsey, Moderna and the CDC all of which are full-time but I’m doing part-time (they don’t know that I’m full of shit, overcommitted, and drowning in work, but now you do). 
The Study Abroad FOMO Disease Spreader
I’m actually doing an internship abroad! In Europe! It’s been my lifelong dream to travel outside of North America and now I’m doing it. When I come back to campus, I’ll make sure to spend the first three months showing everyone all the unique cities I’ve been to — Paris, London, and Rome. Does my boss know I don’t speak French? I do speak French! At elementary proficiency… 
I’m a Proud Nepo Baby
This summer? Hmmm… I guess it’s time to call my uncle. You know, the one that works at McKinsey’s New York City branch, so I can get this job fair and square. With my 4.0 GPA and my out-of-this-world confidence in advising major companies definitely not gained solely from my experience working with certain campus consulting clubs — I’ll get a job in no time. 
I’m Broke but It’s New York City 
NEW YORK CITY is the greatest city in the whole wide world. I’ll be there all summer! Have I found an affordable place to live? Nope. Have I found any place to live? Nope. I’m sure my summer stipend will cover the cost of housing. Meals are another story… but the sights! There is so much to see in the city and with public transportation, everything will be so affordable. (not.) 
I May Be Doing Nothing But I Can’t Tell You That 
This summer, I will be in the comfort of my hometown, hanging out with friends from high school. You know, I love investing in my long-term friendships and local community. I’ll be working from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on some personal projects and in the evenings, I’ll spend quality time with my family. It’s really an ideal summer situation (lowkey, this may be 100 percent the ideal living situation). 
None of these are relatable? Think again or ask a friend to call you out. If you genuinely cannot relate to any of these and are simply ~not like other Harvard students~, we applaud your individualism. Regardless of your certified summer plan red flag, flyby wishes you all a fulfilling summer experience and hope you make the most of this break!
