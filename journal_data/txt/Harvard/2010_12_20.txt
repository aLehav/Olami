After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s impossible to say whether or not the most vivid image in all of “Inland Empire,” which ran for three nights last weekend in Adams House, was that of a hypnotized dance between two players inexplicably bound to one another at the groin by a rope to the modulated sounds of George Gershwin’s “Summertime.” The scene unfolds against the bare stage-space of Adams Pool Theatre, its figures held in high relief by harsh white light. They embrace, tumble to the floor; suddenly the woman, bearing a knife, kills her partner. Her flight from the scene is cut short by the cord that refuses to relinquish its hold, despite her wordless desperation, and she looks on in horror as her extinguished lover comes alive again to reel her back into his arms. Off to the side, the ‘singer’ hands the microphone to another performer, who continues the unsettling lip-synching act. When the anxiety of it all seems to have reached its limit, the scene is interrupted by a sound offstage and the players—actors playing actors, acting in the scene that has just unfolded—break their ‘performance’ and exit.
It’s impossible to call this one act definitive because this reviewer has not seen all of them. “Inland Empire,” directed by Ilinca Radulian ’11 and inspired by material from David Lynch’s film of the same name, is a purposefully fragmented theatrical experience. Mapped out across the various spaces of Adams House, the piece as a whole consists of three parallel narratives. Members of the audience are asked to choose which of the threads they want to follow, and it behooves them to stick with that choice until the end. The belief that these three stories apparently shift into one another at times throughout the painstakingly-coordinated hour of the performance requires something of a leap of faith for the viewer: “Inland Empire” is not so much a story as it is the persistent deferral of a narrative center. Ultimately, each scene isn’t a development of a plot per se, but a variation on the theme of performance that Radulian places front and center from the outset: the performance of the theater, the performance of gender and sexuality, the performance of subjective identity or sanity.
Radulian evidently sympathizes with Lynch’s ambivalence on these matters, as well as the psychoanalytic and surrealist modes he uses to interrogate them. Condensed within each of these tableaux vivants are traces of the Lacanian: the play of drive and desire, alienation and identification, violence both symbolic and actual. The wedding dress—a paradoxical signifier of chastity and the marriage bed, of the maternal and its performance—is the prescribed uniform for all the female performers, and occasionally of the males as well. Drawn closer still from Lynch’s work is the piece’s dialogue, whose ellipsis and rehearsed emptiness sabotage direct communication in order to plumb a fundamentally absent diegetic order. In philosophy, “Inland Empire” bears a family resemblance to the American Repertory Theater’s production of Punchdrunk’s “Sleep No More.” Both are interested in puncturing—albeit playfully—the boundary between performer and audience. The use of unconventional performance spaces like a resident’s dorm room or a music practice room creates an aura of intimacy and of chance, as if the things the viewers see are happening not just in front of them but for them.
Ambitious in theory, the piece is shakier in its execution. Novel though these spaces and their organization might be, something of the atmosphere’s sinister quality is lost in the shuffle of audience members to properly place themselves in rooms that are often poorly lit, especially when breaks in the choreography occur. Similarly, Adams residents passing through or studying in places where these scenes occur tended to draw attention to an element of silliness in the production, against which formidably straight-faced performers were helpless. Limitations on resources and available space are the way of student theater, but for a production with otherwise professional aspirations, such a major oversight is lethal.
And professional it remains, for the most part. As important as its synchronicity is the production’s choreography of gestures, mapped by David F. “Ricky” Kuperman ’11, which gives pace to the eeriness of each scene and elevates the brokenness of communication in the world of the play from the verbal to the physical. For her improvisational courage during a rather long and potentially monotonous slog through an Adams tunnel to the final scene, Rheeqrheeq A. Chainey ’11 deserves a special commendation; creative thinking like hers provided a saving grace for potentially embarrassing moments in the performance. Isabel Q. Carey ’12, Eli E. Kahn ’13, and Dan J. Giles ’13 all play to their marks as the contorted Hollywood tropes—the femme fatale, the tall dark lead, and the double-talking agent—that characterize Lynch’s best-known work. Would that it were possible to hear them, see them, arrest them all on stage and avoid the muddle of undue darkness and words lost in the shuffle of the audience’s falling footsteps.
Perhaps it’s more of a compliment than a criticism to say that a piece of this scale belongs on the Loeb Drama Center’s Mainstage, not in the tunnels beneath Adams House. Ultimately, the moments where “Inland Empire” crystallizes are too few and far between to justify a structure whose inaccessibility and string of logistical woes hamper what would otherwise be a genuinely compelling theatrical experience. “The Space Between,” which ran on the Mainstage in 2009, comes to mind as a similarly high-concept production for which the stage was not just a boon but an essential component in its success. Lynch’s film is something of a white whale in the filmic discourse of the last decade, a work whose enigma other filmmakers have yet to follow. The demands of an engagement with the film—if not a strict adaptation—go beyond the vision of its director or the dedication of its cast, which “Inland Empire” surely doesn’t lack. They amount to the full, material commitment to a sustained encounter with the surreal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team will have its hands full this Wednesday night when it travels to Hartford, Conn. to take on No. 4 UConn.
The Huskies—who entered Sunday night with an 8-0 record—are one of just nine undefeated teams in the country and boast arguably the top player in the nation in junior Kemba Walker.
Walker—a 6’1” point guard with blazing quickness—currently leads the nation in scoring, averaging 28.1 points per game.
But even with a talented opponent looming, the Crimson (7-2) has been preparing for this Wednesday’s contest just like any other.
“We’re preparing like we do for every other team,” sophomore Kyle Casey said.
“We’re doing what we do,” added sophomore point guard Brandyn Curry. “We’ve had some really good, competitive practices—fine tuning stuff we need to work on.”
Curry—Harvard’s top perimeter defender—will be saddled with the task of trying to stop Walker, who leads the Huskies in scoring, assists, and steals.
“[UConn] feeds off his energy and his vibe,” Curry said. “I know it’s going to be a tough matchup. I’m just going to try and put as much pressure on him as possible.”
Slowing down the Huskies’ fast-paced and high-powered offense—the squad averages 79.9 points per game—will be crucial to the Crimson’s success.
“They really get out and go,” Casey said. “We’ve got to defend and slow them down in transition.”
The Crimson—which is currently riding a two-game winning streak—has had some success against ranked opponents in recent years. Harvard defeated then-No. 24 Boston College during the 2008-09 season before dropping contests to then-No. 13 UConn and then-No. 13 Georgetown a year ago.
Last season, Harvard played the Huskies close, losing 79-73, thanks to a career performance from Jeremy Lin ’10, who finished the contest with a season-high 30 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s basketball team squares off with No. 4 UConn on Wednesday, it will, of course, be a huge underdog; Ivy League squads playing against power conference teams often are.
But that doesn’t mean there isn’t hope. Just last Saturday, the Yale women’s basketball team upset No. 14 Florida State, 91-85, in New Haven.
Although this win marked the only win by an Ancient Eight basketball team over a top 25 program in 11 tries this season, Ivy schools have been competitive in some of those 10 losses. Most notably, the Cornell men lost at then-No. 13 Minnesota by just five points, 71-66, while the Princeton women dropped a contest at then-No. 22 Vanderbilt by a six-point margin, 74-68.
The Crimson men have other reasons to be optimistic. The next game on the Huskies’ schedule after Wednesday’s contest is a road game at No. 6 Pittsburgh, Connecticut’s biggest game since last month’s Maui Invitational. If Harvard can catch the Huskies looking ahead, it has a shot to replicate last year’s close contest, a game Connecticut won by a slim 79-73 margin.
That may have been exactly what the Lady Bulldogs took advantage of on Saturday. The Seminoles square off with No. 1 Connecticut tomorrow—a game that could have historic ramifications. A win would be the 89th straight for the Lady Huskies, breaking the all-time NCAA record held by John Wooden’s UCLA men’s program.
But of course, Harvard’s recent success against top programs—it beat then-No. 24 Boston College two seasons ago and has already toppled a power-conference school this year in Pac-10 team Colorado—means that the Huskies likely have Harvard very much on their radar.
