After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Returning to campus often means returning to unexpected changes: some good, some bad, and some inconsequential. The recent redesign of the my.harvard.edu website falls into that last category.
We extend our sincere congratulations to Eva Stojchevska ’15 on her winning and aesthetically pleasant design but lament the fact that that change was mostly superficial, while there is still so much room for improvement. My.harvard.edu remains a poor, out-dated excuse for an organizing tool and resource hub. The administration needs to implement real changes to the website and either hire student programmers to address these issues or allocate more resources to the existing information technology department.
At present, there is a huge gap between the official online tools available to Harvard students and the resources that we are technologically capable of creating. The University as a whole has been frustratingly slow in adopting changes to their online resources. Many student projects, such as Shuttle Boy and courses.cs50 have been far more successful than similar attempts by the IT department to provide for student needs.
Given the immense success and popularity of these tools, Harvard should increase its support for them and provide students with greater incentive to take on these time-consuming but much-appreciated projects. Rather than leaving these independent projects to operate separately, Harvard should embed these valuable tools into official websites such as my.harvard.edu. Many great student-designed tools rely on word-of-mouth to spread among the student body. Harvard could do its part by integrating these tools into their official websites. Further action needs to be taken to ensure that students receive a quality of web services commensurate with the high quality of the University.
One plan of action Harvard could take is paying student programmers for the tools they create. Harvard hires science concentrators to work in their labs and talented writers to work for the Writing Center. Following these precedents, the University should also hire talented student programmers and designers to work on improving their web resources. The benefits would be mutual— students could receive additional programming experience and the University could receive feedback on its websites from the individuals who are most affected by them.
The fact is that subpar organizing tools have a very real effect on our lives. At best, they are time-consuming and confusing. At worst, they are responsible for serious administrative errors that can be costly and limiting.
The pre-term planning tool perfectly illustrates this point. There are many problems with the planning tool, not the least of which is its reliable unreliability in predicting course enrollment as accurately as it might. Overflowing classrooms continue to be an issue, even several semesters into its adoption. In addition, the fact that students are required to watch a tutorial on how to use the planning tool indicates a disregard for usability on the part of the designers.
As online technology becomes an increasingly greater part of student’s lives, Harvard has an obligation to keep its resources up-to-date and user-friendly. In many cases, such as course registration, it is even in the administration’s own best interest to do so. By working with the student body to identify gaps in online resources and then putting its talent to work, Harvard can make their online resources a true work of beauty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the new academic year begins and students, staff, and faculty return from vacations, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers continues its negotiations for a new contract with Harvard. Among the sticking points is the topic of healthcare. Many employees are concerned about an increase in premium and co-pay costs. But many of us also worry about gaps in healthcare coverage. One significant gap is coverage for Harvard employees and their families who are affected by autism, a neurological disorder which impairs cognitive development, communication, and social skills.
In 2010, Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 signed House Bill 4935 (An Act Relative to Insurance Coverage for Autism Spectrum Disorder), which required private health insurance plans to provide coverage of medically necessary autism therapies. The bill went into effect on January 1, 2011. Before this bill, the lack of coverage for autism therapies had been an enormous financial burden for families. More importantly, it meant that each individual that went untreated was losing precious time in which to make developmental gains. Denial of coverage has long been recognized as discriminatory to the special needs population and their families. 32 states have enacted such legislation to combat insurance discrimination and meet the urgent needs of individuals and families profoundly affected by the challenges of living with autism.
However, at Harvard, the financial burden continues, along with parental grief that ones’ child is not getting the critical therapies needed to make progress in all areas of development. Due to an exemption in the state law, the families of Harvard employees continue to be excluded from coverage for much needed autism therapies. Under the Massachusetts law, self-funded plans, like Harvard's, are not required to provide medical coverage for autism treatments. Harvard employees and their families remain without access to the unlimited and intensive therapeutic and rehabilitative care (particularly Applied Behavioral Analysis) which has been deemed necessary by Harvard's very own medical researchers. Such services include training for parents and primary caregivers in order to help them manage their children's self-care skills, behavior, social skills, and communication. ABA is the most commonly prescribed therapy for individuals with autism, and, in addition to being endorsed by the medical community, it is recognized as the most effective treatment by the Surgeon General, the National Research Council, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.
A 2006 Harvard study cites the societal cost of not treating a child with autism as $3.2 million over that individual's lifetime. Another significant cost is the financial and emotional strain on parents and primary care givers. There is significant data on lost wages, employee use of sick time to care for dependents on the autism spectrum, and the development of stress and anxiety disorders by parents. Taken together, these factors amount to far more than the less than 1 percent premium increase that autism coverage is estimated to cost.
There are a great number of Harvard-affiliated doctors, scientists, and researchers who have contributed significantly to the study and treatment (for there is no cure) of autism. At least two members of Harvard's own medical faculty serve on the Scientific Advisory Board of Autism Speaks, which has become the “world’s leading autism science and advocacy organization.” Earlier this week, the National Institute of Health announced awards of $100 million in grants to support autism research. Among the recipients is Mustafa Sahin, M.D., Ph.D. of the Harvard Medical School. These individuals, along with the employees represented in the special needs parent support group here at Harvard, potentially comprise a strong base of support for an initiative to bring this important and just change to our insurance coverage.
There are many large U.S. companies and institutions that have self-insured medical plans like Harvard’s, yet recognize the urgency of treating autism. Employers including Tufts University, Princeton University, Ohio State University, University of Minnesota, University of Pennsylvania, Deloitte, the City of Cambridge, and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare all offer their employees autism coverage. In June, the U.S. government also added autism coverage to its health plan for federal employees and, in the process, redefined ABA as a medical treatment, not a behavioral or educational service. Yet still, some Harvard employees, the author included, are compelled to supplement their Harvard medical plans by carrying costly secondary insurance policies.
As a research institution, Harvard is at the forefront of the scientific research for discovering the causes of autism and for identifying new treatments. As an employer and in practice, Harvard’s medical policy is deleterious to every individual with autism.
Harvard, too, should stand behind their scientific findings for the treatment of autism. It should join the list of forward thinking employers who recognize the need to provide equal access to medically necessary services to individuals on the autism spectrum. Harvard should not wait to be forced to do so by law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I don’t ever want to play the part, of a statistic on a government chart.”  That defiant intonation from “Invisible Sun” by The Police probably strikes a chord with the average American. I’m more than a scribbling of ink—I’m more than a sterile, monochrome graph bar—I’m me. And yet the singer, Sting, by accruing the $280-plus million now estimated as his net worth, opted to eschew the profundity of his lyric. As it turns out, earning and spending dollars—especially 280-plus million of them—is a surefire path to becoming a statistic on an ever-ballooning number of government charts.
And those statistics and charts have spread beyond the realm of the ivory-tower wonk or back office cruncher. They’re the cornerstones of headlines and political ads—maudlin music, deep narration (or, in one TV ad, Mitt Romney rasping through America the Beautiful), and the stark, swollen numbers. Ah, the numbers.
Nonpartisan sites like Factcheck.org and Politifact.com are littered with reports of faulty figures, like Indiana Governor Mitch E. Daniels’ claim that “Nearly half of all persons under 30 did not go to work today” (he included full-time students), or Senator Harry M. Reid’s assertion that there was a “loss of eight million jobs during the Bush eight years” (there was certainly a loss, but not “during the Bush eight years”).
In a review of several books on politics and statistics, University of Alberta sociologist Kevin D. Haggerty cites a telling example, drawn from Damned Lies and Statistics by Joel Best. In the 1980s, reports swirled of 50,000 abducted, “missing children” in America. As big numbers are wont to do, the statistics spawned action—police databases, television programming, PSAs, and more. Unfortunately, the words “missing” (i.e. not momentarily out of sight) and “children” (i.e. not adults) had both been skewed. Subsequent analysis readjusted the total from 50,000 to 70, and the scare passed.
The number 50,000 wouldn’t work today. Thousands are irksome. Millions, for now, are good. Billions are better. And trillions, of course, are best. In a telling number-chase, BarackObama.com claims Mr. Romney would levy $2000 in new taxes from each middle class family. Of course, 2000 is a small number, so the web page displays the nine-figure total of targeted U.S. middle-class families above—in much larger font—with its impressive digit triplets and commas. I wish we could find comfort in the old aphorism, “Statistics are for losers.” But that’s not logically possible. Statistics cannot possibly be reserved for losers. Not when A) everyone is slinging them and B) someone has to win.
And even if the statistics are right, what next? Is their message effective, in a constructive way? Maybe not. When CNN polled for estimates of federal spending on 10 major programs, respondents placed the spending 50 percent above the actual level, an error worth hundreds of billions of hotly debated dollars. According to an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development report, “In several countries, a large majority of people believed that that actual inflation rate was between 50 percent and 100 percent, while official estimates indicated [inflation] rates between 2 percent and 3 percent.” (That’s a scary gap. At 2-3 percent rates, smart investors buy a few-percent certificate deposit or money market shares. At 50-100 percent rates, they start a cash-for-gold shop.) Mr. Haggerty suggests a core problem, that “citizens are inundated on a daily basis with untold numbers of statistical facts, making it impossible to develop a critical appreciation for all but a few these numbers.”
Two points of caution, however. For one, public ignorance isn’t the real issue. A Platonic team of experts won’t solve our problem. (Who’s experts?—FDR’s or Reagan’s? Bush’s? Obama’s? Ralph Nader’s, maybe, if he has any? Even the numbers-guys can’t agree on much.)  Today, the alleged experts fling numbers more than anyone. And anyway, it was Plato himself who wrote, “A good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers.” (Plato, admittedly, had never heard of logistic regression.) Second, anti-intellectualism isn’t the answer either. Numbers and statistics—like the inflation rate discussed above—are still powerful and informative, and they can tell us a lot about the world. It’s merely that they cannot, and should not, tell us whom to vote for in November.
Why not? After all, this election is about budgets and fiscal strategies—about the numbers. But statistics only carry us as far as our ideals propel them. This election is really about fundamentals—about the state, its citizens, and their intersection. Fifteen-plus trillion dollars in debt poses Armageddon to a fiscal hawk, but won’t phase a strong Keynesian. Tax cuts on “millionaires and billionaires,” to borrow the president’s numerical rhetoric, are sound to a conservative and anathema to Mr. Obama. And there’s nothing wrong with that.
We need to emphasize the ideas behind the veil of digits. It’s tempting to long for an apolitical approach, attention only to facts and numbers and statistics. It’s especially tempting in the face of ideologies that seem to have failed us. But numbers are an empty bastion for the wayward. The onus is on us to fill in the ideas and the values, the substance. I just wish I had a good statistic to prove it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are in the midst of one of the most exciting times in politics: the months leading up to the presidential election. This is the time when each candidate and his respective party can show America what they want to change about our government and improve about our country. This is the time for all politicians to use their tremendous public exposure to let the people know exactly how they want to resolve some of the most relevant and pressing issues that our country faces today, especially the state of our economy. This is the time, and all anyone can seem to talk about is women.
Politicians on both sides routinely tout the economy as the most important—if not the sole—issue at stake in this election. And rightfully so: The unemployment rate is 8.3 percent and no immediate improvement is in sight. What’s more, our national debt is at an all-time high. Each party should be focusing on exactly how they plan to improve the state of our economy. Empty platitudes about job creation and deficit cutting are not enough: we need attention paid to actual policy proposals. Yet, rather than focusing on detailed, substantive economic programs, both Democrats and Republicans have spent the past few months deliberating on the female body and various laws and rights associated with it, including abortion, contraceptives, and female income.
Don’t get me wrong, the issue of women’s rights is tremendously important and needs to be discussed. The American public needs to know what stance each presidential candidate and his respective party take on the various facets of women’s rights. These are the politicians who will be in office, making decisions that will directly affect how all women in this country live and thrive. As a woman myself, I am concerned with what each candidate believes and plans on doing to help protect my rights; however, this is only to a point. I do believe that the media and the politicians have become so engrossed in women’s issues as to leave the most important questions almost unanswered.
The Democratic National Convention, which just took place, was the party’s chance for to lay out their plan for the next four years. Yet starting on the first day,  figures who have made their careers on women’s issues took to the stage, such as Nancy Keenan who is the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.
The lack of focus on the economy in favor of a focus on women is not just the fault of all the politicians involved in this political season; it is also the fault of the press. The media is thoroughly enjoying the focus on women. It is taking what politicians say about women and making sure that the entire country hears it verbatim ad nauseum. Take, for instance, Rush Limbaugh’s controversy with Sandra K. Fluke. Fluke tried to testify in support of contraception, and Limbaugh used that fact to call her a “slut.” This incident earned a lot of media attention that took away from discussions about the economy. Another incident worth mentioning is that of Representative Todd Akin(R-MO) and his “legitimate rape” fiasco. While the words that Akin spoke showed ignorance and insensitivity, they created a massive media frenzy that drew the time and attention of both the Democrats and Republicans that should have been spent and focused on the state of the economy and plans to revive it.
Our country’s fixation with the female body needs to be toned down in favor of what many insist is the most important issue of this year’s election: the economy. While both campaigns tout this as an election about the economy, the greatest brouhahas during this election season concern issues of women and their bodies. These issues are legitimate and deserve some attention, but should not occupy the spotlight for the entirety of the campaign season.

EdX, Harvard and MIT’s joint non-profit virtual learning initiative, will offer a proctored final exam for one of its courses this fall, President of edX and MIT Professor Anant Agarwal announced Thursday morning.
Harvard and MIT have committed $30 million each to the online platform, which was announced in early May of this year and will allow students worldwide to take one of seven classes taught in an actual classroom at either Harvard, MIT, or the University of California in Berkeley.
Until now, edX planned to have its students agree to an honor code before taking exams. Students would receive a Certificate of Mastery upon passing the course. Now, for a currently undisclosed fee, students can choose to visit a test center to complete their final exams and, upon passing, receive a certificate indicating completion of the course with a proctored test, according to an edX press release.
“This will take online learning to a next level,” Agarwal said on a conference call with reporters.
Agarwal explained that proctored testing is an improvement on the current model of online education because it allows students to show that they have mastered the material by proving that the work they have done is their own.
He added that proctored testing will make edX certificates much more valuable because he anticipates that employers and educational institution will be more comfortable with certificates received based on proctored testing results rather than a promise to adhere to an honor code.
He said, however, that the move to proctored testing was not a response to any specific concerns of cheating or plagiarism.
“The students were doing a really good job of monitoring themselves,” Agarwal said.
He said that while edX courses match their in-class counterparts, it will be up to universities to decide if and when they will grant credit for edX classes. Agarwal said that to start, only one of the seven edX courses will offer proctored testing.
“The whole movement itself is a big experiment,” Agarwal said. “The reason we are starting with one is to see how it goes.”
EdX has not yet announced which course will offer a proctored test but Agarwal said this decision will be made public soon.
For the proctored exams, edX is partnering with computer-based testing company Pearson VUE, according to the press release. The company operates test centers that edX students in more than 110 countries will be able to visit to take their exams.
President and Chief Executive Officer of Pearson VUE Robert Whelan told reporters that while his company creates testing programs for some online education ventures, edX professors will create their own system. However if  the program gets larger, Whelan said, the Pearson VUE could potentially assist in making the tests themselves.

While last month’s rapes still linger on the minds of undergraduates, an annual report sent out by the administration this week has taken some students aback.
Between 2008 and 2010, about four rapes were reported to the Harvard University Police Department each year. The number of rapes on campus, however, is much higher—an average 15 per year—according to the University report.
The report,  entitled Playing It Safe, includes statistics from three years worth of “reported campus or campus-related crimes.”
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, the larger number is a composite of the formal assaults reported to HUPD and the confidential reports made to the University Health Services and the Office of Sexual Assault and Prevention.
Several  Harvard students found the larger figure alarming.
“When I thought it was just four assaults, I was scared,” said Aria N. Bendix ’15. “Even four is four too many.”
UHS spokesperson Lindsey Garofalo said that 95 percent of the confidential reports come from OSAPR, with the remaining from UHS.
Some students said they suspect that the number of rapes on campus each year may be higher than 15, but that victims of assault may be hesitant to come forward.
“I imagine there are more assaults that aren’t reported,” said LuSheng Xu ’15. “I think 15 is a small number for a school this big.”
Garofalo stated that many victims of sexual assault are reluctant to report the assault. “While we work hard to eliminate barriers to reporting, the reality is that it is a very difficult and personal decision. Nationally, sexual assault remains one of the most underreported crimes for a variety of reasons ranging from fears about public reactions to not wanting to continue thinking about the experience,” she said.
According to a report on sexual assault on college campuses compiled by the National Institute of Justice, rape and other forms of sexual assault tend not to be reported as consistently as other types of crime. The report states that “more than 35 percent [of reported victims] said they did not report the incident because they were unclear as to whether a crime was committed or that harm was intended.”
The report also states that approximately 3 percent of all college women become victims of either completed or attempted rape in the academic year.
According to Garofalo, victims of sexual assault may choose to report the incident to UHS or OSAPR, which works with victims in many capacities, as an alternative to the HUPD. Victims that report the crime to HUPD can make the decision whether to file a formal complaint or criminal charges against the perpetrator.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Freshman Dean’s Office set aside the controversial freshman pledge this year, opting instead for additional programming for the class of 2016 during Opening Days that focused on developing empathy and respect for classmates.
This year, proctors were trained to foster discussion about community values, and freshmen performed skits depicting sensitive situations with roommates and friends.
“We did not have [freshmen] sign pledges, but we pushed every bit as hard on how important it was to consider their growth on all fronts,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
The pledge drew criticism soon after its inception, when former Dean of the college Harry R. Lewis ‘68 disparaged the practice in a blog post.
In October 2011, administrators reaffirmed their decision to make Harvard’s values clear to freshmen, even if that message did not take the form of a pledge. According to Dingman, this led to changes in proctor training that focused on helping students grow as “understanding, empathetic people,” as well as helping them excel academically.
“When I talked to the proctors, I said I felt it’s not enough for our students to be smart or ambitious,” Dingman said. “That counts, of course, but so does the ability to be empathetic and respectful.”
The scenarios presented to proctors—which were later re-enacted by students—focused on scenes that Dingman described as having “potential for insensitivity.” Examples included a religious roommate choosing to display a cross in a common area and a wealthy roommate purchasing a large TV that other roommates cannot afford to chip in for.
“This happens every year, frankly,” Dingman said of the latter scenario. “This way, students learn how to have a conversation where someone doesn’t feel marginalized.”
These exercises were well-received among members of the class of 2016.  Isaac G. Inkeles ’16, said he was particularly struck by a scenario that depicted use of the amnesty policy. “The lessons were effective because they were creative, fun, and lively,” Inkeles said.
The changes were also praised by proctors.
“It seemed that proctor orientation had added emphasis on identifying and fostering values to create a strong, successful residential and academic community,” said proctor Brooks Lambert-Sluder. “In turn, that led to more emphasis on these values of respect and community during the first entryway meetings.”
In addition to the scenarios, proctors were provided with a list of goals for their students, including honoring diversity, recognizing the value of honesty, and being aware of unhealthy competition.
Though Dingman acknowledged that these values had relevancy to the high-profile Government 1310: “Intro to Congress” cheating incident that transpired last spring, he said that the new programming was not created in reaction to that event, as it had been planned in advance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sophomore class was welcomed back to campus Thursday at a ceremony in Memorial Church that featured the official presentation of the Class of 2015’s color: blue.
The ceremony, hosted by the Harvard Alumni Association in conjunction with the Undergraduate Council, revives a tradition of each graduating class passing down its color to the sophomore class.
“To me, class colors celebrate much of what’s special about Harvard,” said Annie E. DeAngelo ’12 to the Class of 2015. “They celebrate Harvard’s past and the traditions that make Harvard how it is today. They celebrate your particular class, which is the group that you truly experience this wonderful place with. And most importantly, they celebrate people and the connections between thousands of students and alumni that span centuries.”
Following DeAngelo’s remarks, a new Class of 2015 banner with blue trim was revealed from behind the Class of 2012’s banner. Later, students were given blue-trimmed class t-shirts.
Class colors date back to the late 1800s when classes adopted the colors of Yale, Dartmouth, and Princeton to foster class unity. The colors—blue, green, and orange—also made it easier for fans to differentiate athletes at sporting events.
At past Commencements, seniors would present their colors to rising sophomores. Freshmen were always represented by the color crimson. The tradition continued into the 1960s until it “mysteriously faded out,” DeAngelo said.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Associate Dean of Harvard College Joan Rouse, and UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 also spoke at the well-attended event.
Dingman welcomed back the sophomore class, while Rouse encouraged students to take advantage of the opportunities that surround them.
“Do blue proud!” said Rouse. “Be blue in all the things you want. Find once-in-a-blue-moon opportunities. Sing the blues.”
The event’s revival—following a nearly 50-year hiatus—is the result of a few students’ efforts to build class unity and bring back lost traditions.
Bemoaning the loss of class community she said she experienced after leaving the Yard, Catherine G. Katz ’13 approached administrators with the idea of creating a sophomore class event.
“I felt that it was a shame that the kind of community we worked so hard to build our freshman year was suddenly gone,” said Katz. “Your class community and House community are great communities to be a part of. Why do they have to be mutually exclusive?”
Katz’s idea for a “welcome back” event was combined with a proposal by Justin Lanning ’12 of the HAA’s Building Community Committee to bring back class colors.
“We are trying to strengthen that sense of class identity,” said Bicknell. “This isn’t to counteract House life, it’s to complement it.”
Members of the Class of 2015 said they appreciated building connections to classes past.
“It was nice to see upperclassmen take an interest in our class,” said Ariane Berelowitch ’15 as she exited Memorial Church. “It’s also really nice to see everyone at the beginning of the year.”

UPDATED: September 8, 2012, at 1:31 a.m.
A new literary studio founded by two Harvard graduates that provides a digital platform for writers launched with a partnership with Amazon announced Thursday.
Plympton, named after the Cambridge street that houses both the Harvard Bookstore and The Harvard Crimson, will give writers a service through which they can publish their stories in pieces. Writers will be able to receive editorial feedback from readers who can purchase the serialized pieces.
“Serialization of stories has been around since ‘One Thousand and One Arabian Nights,’”  said co-Founder and President of Plympton Jennifer 8. Lee '99, a former Crimson vice president. “For us, it is very exciting from a literary perspective by bringing back this format for a modern audience.”
Through installments, Plympton enables starting authors to receive compensation for their work as they write. According to Lee, it also allows for creative risk-taking by offering a small-scale platform to launch a writing project, while cultivating an audience.
“We are interested in creating something in between self-publish and traditional publishing houses,” said Yael G. Love '00, co-founder and editorial director of Plympton. “We want something that gives you support, a strong editorial side, and helps you be found among the many, many things that are out there.”
Though commonplace in television, the founders said they hope applying serialization to literature—a novel concept—will generate equal success.
“There is a reason why we have fallen in love with Mad Men and Downton Abbey and Sopranos and Breaking Bad,” Lee said. “The idea here is that we are naturally compelled, as humans, to a story that goes on and on and on.”
Love said that the she and Lee made a conscious decision to evoke Harvard through the naming of their new project.
“Harvard, for better or for worse, fostered a sense to think big and that you can do anything that you set your mind to,” said Love. “It helps that you’re delusional when starting a company.”

Former Marine and technology executive Sean Bielat and former Middlesex County assistant district attorney Joseph P. Kennedy III will face off for the chance to represent Massachusetts’ Fourth Congressional District and fill the seat held for decades by retiring Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62.
Bielat and Kennedy each won their respective primaries handily, sweeping past their party opponents by approximately 70 and 90 percent respectively. Both Bielat and Kennedy hold Harvard degrees, the former from the Kennedy School of Government and the latter from the Law School.
In the Fifth Congressional District—which includes Harvard’s Cambridge campus—consulting actuary Tom Tierney edged out lawyer Frank J. Addivinola Jr. and financial consultant Jeffrey M. Semon for the Republican nomination and the chance to take on Edward J. Markey, the longest-serving Congressman in the Massachusetts delegation.
Democrats are expected to be the frontrunners in both congressional races. Kennedy, a 31-year-old first time candidate, has caught national attention since he declared his candidacy in January, attracting big money and political support in and out of state. Markey has won 18 consecutive elections with 60 percent of the vote or more.
“I got into this race because I believe this country was built on a simple promise: that each of us deserves a fair shot,” Kennedy wrote in a statement Thursday night. “I promise that no one will work harder than our campaign to earn every vote. I look forward to having a real conversation over the next two months about the issues that matter to the people of the 4th.”
Both Kennedy and Markey will be running in traditionally Democratic districts. Though those districts were redrawn earlier this year after the 2010 Census stripped Mass. of one of its Congressional seats, experts expect the Fourth and Fifth will remain strongly Democratic.
Bielat beat out his closest rival, former Massachusetts Department of Mental Health commissioner Elizabeth Childs, with roughly 70 percent of the vote. Though he was the Republican favorite heading into Thursday's primary, Child’s last minute media push and a unfolding controversy surrounding a Federal Election Commission fine leveled against Bielat had rendered the outcome less certain in recent days. Ultimately, these issues were not enough to tighten the race.
“We need to make some tough decisions about the direction that our country is headed,” Bielat said in a statement Thursday night. “Do you trust a recent college graduate with three years of experience or do you trust a Marine with an MBA and extensive experience in national security and business?”
Bielat’s general election contest with Kennedy will not be his first in the Fourth District. In 2010, Bielat fell 11 points short of unseating Frank, closer than any Republican challenger had come in decades. Frank’s retirement announcement earlier this year opened the field for Kennedy and Bielat to enter the race.
Markey is expected to easily best Tierney, a perennial candidate, in the general election. In either case, a new Congressman will represent a large part of Cambridge. That area, previously represented by Congressman Michael Capuano as part of the 8th Congressional District, was redistricted earlier this year into a new, Fifth District. Capuano, who was unopposed Thursday, will now represent the rest of Cambridge in a new 7th District.
Locally, Cambridge City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker won 25th Middlesex District Democratic primary with 84 percent of the vote. The house district is the only one entirely in Cambridge and encompasses Harvard’s campus. With her primary victory Thursday and without a Republican opponent in November, Decker is only a formality away from a seat on Beacon Hill.
Both candidates for Massachusetts junior U.S. Senate seat—Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and incumbent U.S. Senator Scott Brown—were uncontested in Thursday’s primary. Fresh off a nationally-televised speech at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night, Warren’s only public appearance of the day came en route to cast her own ballot in Cambridge. Brown was equally low-key, accepting the endorsement of a former Springfield mayor.
As predicted, without any contested statewide primary races, few voters turned out for the rare Thursday election.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday voters headed to the polls for the state primaries—the first time an election in the state has been held on a Thursday since 1988.
Massachusetts primaries, which are generally held on Tuesdays early in September, were disrupted by a rare confluence of events. The first Tuesday this year fell immediately after Labor Day. Had the primary been held on Sept. 4, municipalities would have been forced to pay workers overtime to prepare for the polls, so the date was rejected, according to Brian McNiff, spokesperson for Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin.
The next Tuesday, Sept. 11, was turned down by the State Legislature out of deference to the memorials and observances of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, McNiff said. September 18 falls during Rosh Hashanah, a Jewish holiday, and was rejected because it would limit some Jewish voters’ abilities to make it to the polls. Holding the election on a later Tuesday would conflict with the law that ballots must be finalized at least 45 days before the general election.
Though the effect of the unusual date is hard to pinpoint, turnout across the state was low, as noted by clerks. Debate remains as to whether voter turnout was low because voters were unaware of the election or because very few major seats were contested.
Frank Kramer, who worked the polling site at Graham & Parks School said that turnout for primary elections is frequently low. Kramer said that the fact that there were no contested statewide primaries on either ballot likely depressed numbers, but that most primary voters—who are largely perennial voters—were mindful that the election was on Thursday not Tuesday.
“It does throw people off, but if you look at whose voting…everybody who usually votes was here,” Kramer said.
On Wednesday, local pundit Robert Winters predicted that few people would get out to vote. “There’s a good chance that it will be a ridiculously low turnout,” he said.
Quincy House served as the polling location for the voting precinct that includes most of the river houses. Decia Goodwin, a resident of Cambridge who has worked at this poll for the past few years, said that it is known to be one of the quieter voting places. Only 35 people showed up to vote at Quincy House on Thursday.
Goodwin said that they often get people, mostly students, who want to vote but are unable to do so because they are not registered in the district.
“We anticipate on November 6 there will be a lot of confusion about students’ right to vote here, so we’re really pushing these voter registration forms,” Goodwin said.
Goodwin distributed forms and also reminded voters that they must register before October 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Susan Hockfield, the first female president of the Massachusetts Institute for Technology, will serve as the Marie Curie Visiting Professor at the Harvard Kennedy School this academic year, the school announced Friday.
Though Hockfield will not be teaching any courses, she will work with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs on energy policy as it relates to sustainability and American manufacturing.
Hockfield, who will continue to hold a faculty appointment as a professor of neuroscience at MIT, will also spend her time at Kennedy School exploring community and leadership through the lens of neuroscience.
“Following 14 years in academic leadership, the Kennedy School and the Belfer Center provide an ideal environment for reflection, study and conversation. I’m delighted to join this remarkable community,” Hockfield said in statement.
Hockfield served as the 16th president of MIT from December 2004 to June 2012. Hockfield focused her research on brain development and on glioma, a lethal form of brain cancer.
Under her tenure at MIT, Hockfield advocated the use of research universities in driving innovation and economic growth. Prior to her term as president of MIT, Hockfield was a faculty member at Yale University.
In 2006, Hockfield helped to launch the MIT Energy Initiative, a $359 million program that brings together researchers, educators, and policy experts to focus on clean energy. In June 2011, Hockfield was asked to co-chair the steering committee of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership by President Obama.
“[Hockfield] has demonstrated not only intellectual leadership but also public leadership in her time with MIT. This combination is precisely what the Kennedy school aspires to,” Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 said. “We’re very honored to have her with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team (1-0-1) has good reason to be confident as it takes the field against University of Dayton (3-3) Friday night at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium. After drawing a hotly contested match last Monday with local rival Boston University, the Crimson looks to extend its unbeaten streak for the season against the Flyers in its second home match of the year and then on the road against Colgate (4-2-1).
For Harvard, these two weekend matchups against relatively unknown but well-respected sides stand as unique opportunities to test the team’s mettle and serve as launchpads for the Crimson into the rest of the season.
HARVARD v. DAYTON
The Crimson faces a truly unfamiliar opponent in the Flyers, but an opponent that nonetheless is preceded by an impressive reputation. As one of the premier programs in the Atlantic-10 division and nationally, Dayton comes to New England on a two-day weekend tour that will see the Flyers take on both the Crimson and Northeastern.
“[Dayton is] a very good team that won 19 games last year,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They’ve won a lot of championships for good reason. They are fast, [and] they are difficult to defend.... The game against BU really helped prepare us. We just have to be ready to stay with whatever they bring to the game and match their intensity.”
In the Crimson’s outing last Monday, Harvard was finally able to put an end to a three-game losing streak against the Terriers.
Senior defender Taryn Kurcz showcased her versatility on the field and led Harvard offensively, notching two goals off headers and nearly converting a third goal in extra time. In net, sophomore Bethany Kanteen registered five saves on the night.
After opening up the season with a 3-1 record—highlighted by a thrilling, last-minute victory against BU—the Flyers have suffered back-to-back losses at home, to Central Michigan and DePaul by scores of 4-2 and 2-1, respectively.
Yet despite Dayton’s recent downturn, the Flyers’ offense has nonetheless remained a well-oiled machine capable of fearsome firepower. In its first six games of the season, Dayton has scored 17 goals, with midfielders Juliana Libertin and Ashley Campbell along with junior forward Colleen Williams serving as the Flyers’ leading playmakers and scorers. Crimson coach Ray Leone took time to emphasize Colleen Williams’ talent.
“Though we don’t know their team that well since we’ve never played them before, we do know that Colleen Williams is one of the best strikers in the country,” Leone said. “The kid got 45 or 50 goals one year which is quite an accomplishment. She’s going to be a handful for us, and we are going to have to play very well in order to contain her.”
Despite the unique challenge that Dayton poses for the Crimson, both Coach Leone and junior co-captain Peyton Johnson emphasized that practice during the week was about shoring up key weaknesses and points of concern for the team going forward, and less about devising a unique game plan to counter the Flyers.
“Early on in the season we don’t practice so much towards the other team and more towards working on we need to work on,” Johnson said. “We’ve been just really working on what’s going to make us a great team for the rest of the season and worrying less about our opponent.”
HARVARD v. COLGATE
On Sunday, the Harvard women’s soccer team leaves Cambridge on a journey into upstate New York for a matchup at Colgate. The Crimson hopes to earn its second road victory of the season after beating UMass, 2-0, in the first match of the regular season.
“This is going to be our first big away game, so we’ll have the opportunity to see how that works,” Johnson said. “For a lot of freshman, this will be their first overnight game, and it will be an exciting experience for us all being so far away from home and playing another really unfamiliar team like Dayton.”
With seven matches under the Raiders’ belts so far this season and 20 goals already scored, much like Dayton, the high-octane Colgate offensive line, led by senior forward Jillian Kinter, seems ready to test the Crimson back four.
But despite facing new territory this weekend with home and away games against unfamiliar opponents, Harvard seems is optimistic about its chances.
“This weekend there are going to be some surprises and hopefully we’ll show our best,” Johnson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (1-1) will attempt to snap losing streaks against two New England squads this weekend as it takes on Providence on Saturday before returning to Jordan Field on Sunday for a contest against No. 17 Boston College.
The Crimson has lost four straight matchups to the Friars (1-2) and seven straight to the Eagles (3-1) over the past few seasons.
But the Harvard team—led defensively by the goalie tandem of co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos and junior Jenn Hatfield—looks to build off of a solid opening weekend and compete with traditionally tough opponents.
“No game is going to be a given,” sophomore Sydney Jenkins said. “We just need to be confident. We are expecting very difficult matches but nothing impossible.”
Last weekend, Harvard pulled off a late 1-0 victory over Holy Cross  before suffering a heartbreaking, 2-1 loss to Sacred Heart two days later, allowing the tying goal with close to five minutes remaining in regulation and ultimately losing in double overtime.
Despite the loss, the Crimson remains positive about its first two contests.
“I don’t think we could’ve asked for a better opening weekend,” sophomore Noel Painter said. “I know that we lost on Monday which was hard, but I think we got a lot out of it. We were able to practice being down a man and practice being in overtime against teams other than ourselves.”
Another new look this season was first year head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden’s implementation of a goalie rotation, using three-year starter and all-Ivy honorable mention Tassopoulos against the Crusaders and Hatfield in her first career start against the Pioneers.
Both performed under pressure, with Tassopoulos recording a shutout with four saves and Hatfield recording 15 saves before suffering a close loss.
“Cynthia and Jenn have very different playing styles,” Painter said. “But in practice, they are always rotating and switching out so I think it really didn’t affect us that much.... I have great confidence in both goalies.”
“Judging from last year, the goalies definitely have become more competitive,” Jenkins added. “And it seems like—though they already have the mindset: don’t let a ball get past them—now it’s just even further advanced.”
In the first two games of the season, sophomore Catriona McDonald and junior Caroline McNeill each scored a goal, while sophomore Caitlin Rea has contributed two assists.
On Saturday, Harvard will travel to Providence to face off against the Friars, who are coming off of their first win of the season—a 6-2 victory over Kent State.
Prior to the win, Providence had taken both No. 25 Maine and No. 12 Boston University to overtime before finally succumbing in extra time, 3-2 and 1-0 respectively.
Sophomore forward Daniella Bernasconi leads the team with four points and two goals, while sophomore Deidra Clymer and senior Kathi Weldman have split time in net for the Friars.
Boston College will face the No. 12 Terriers on Friday following its first loss of the season last weekend—a 2-1 defeat in overtime and against No. 19 Massachusetts. The Eagles had defeated No. 20 Michigan State, the No. 25 Black Bears, and Quinnipiac before falling to BU.
Junior forward Virgynia Muma leads the team with three goals and six points, notching the decisive goal in the Eagles’ 1-0 win against the Spartans and netting two in their 4-1 victory over Maine.
“The game against BC is going to be a real test for our team to see how we handle the playing. I do think we can stay them,” Painter said. “It’s just going to be a matter of trusting the system that we’ve been using this year and trusting in each other. And I really think we can stay with them, but we’ll find out on Sunday.”
The Crimson will look to combat the fast-starting Boston College squad with strong defense, conditioned legs, and an improving attack.
“We’ve actually been doing a lot of drills that are primarily based creating on 2v1s and then finishing,” Jenkins said. “We have a lot of the pieces there. We just need to finish and get some goals.”
“A great team is defined by the fundamentals,” Painter added. “So that’s what we’ve been working on, our stops, our hitting, our conditioning, and I think that, if we continue to work on those, we can take on any team in the country.”

This weekend, the Harvard men’s water polo team (2-1) travels to Princeton, N.J., for the Princeton Invitational Tournament to face Cal Lutheran, California, Johns Hopkins (4-0), and the host Tigers.
The contests at Princeton mark the Crimson’s second tournament of the young season. Harvard opened play at the MIT Labor Day Invite, where rookies Blake Lee and Noah Harrison helped to facilitate the Harvard offense, accounting for six goals apiece on the weekend. Harrison was named CWPA North Division Rookie of the Week for his six-goal, one-steal, five-assist effort.
Harvard will start off its second invitational against Cal Lutheran on Friday evening. The Kingsmen notched a program-high 15 wins last season to finish 15-11 and hold a No. 5 Division III preseason ranking.
After Friday evening, the Crimson will face even tougher competition in the No .13 Tigers (0-0), and No.3 Golden Bears Saturday afternoon. Princeton—currently ranked first in the CWPA—finished last season 24-10. Sophomore Drew Hoffenberg figures to be an integral part of the Tigers’ offense after finishing his 2011 campaign with 47 goals, 36 assists, and 11 blocks.
Like Princeton, University of California figures to be a tough matchup for Harvard. The Golden Bears feature sophomore attacker Aleksa Saponjic who won a bronze medal for the Serbian Olympic team in London this summer. California went 22-4 last season.
“Our goal is to try to win every game,” co-captain Max Eliot said. “It’s still early in the season … [and] we have a young team [so] we are going to try to continue to develop, learn from every single game, and work on team chemistry.”
The Crimson will finish off its weekend against Johns Hopkins. The Blue Jays are on a four-game winning streak after a successful weekend at the annual Navy Labor Day Open.

After dropping its first three games of the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team looks to turn things around this weekend as it hosts the Harvard Invitational.
The Crimson will play its home opener at the Malkin Athletic Center against Manhattan (1-5) tonight, face off against Providence (1-9) on Saturday, and close the tournament against Northern Kentucky (7-0) later in the day.
Although the Harvard went 0-3 last weekend, captain outside hitter Taylor Docter—who recorded 31 kills and 24 digs to make the Hokie Invitational All-Tournament team—said she thought last weekend’s game experience was crucial to Harvard’s team development.
“It gave us a lot to work off this week in practice,” Docter said. “I think that coming into this weekend we’re a little more confident.”
With all of its freshmen getting playing time last weekend, Harvard hopes to build team chemistry as it incorporates its newcomers
“[The] four freshmen have been on and off the court,” Docter said. “It’ll be good to have three games this weekend [and] three games the following weekend before we get into Ivy League play [on Sept. 21], just to be able to get more comfortable with each other.”
Rookie outside hitter Kathleen Wallace had a strong opening weekend for Harvard, managing 25 kills and 5 digs.
Harvard’s first two games will come against teams that have struggled as of late. The Jaspers have lost their last three games  and the Friars have dropped their last five. The Norse, on the other hand, have won their remain undefeated after seven games.
Though Docter doesn’t anticipate these teams will be as difficult as last weekend’s Hokie Invitational opponents, the matches will likely still be challenging for Harvard.
“The teams we played last weekend are really tall, big girls, and they ran a really fast offense,” she said. “I’m not sure that the teams this weekend will be the same. They’ll probably be a little bit scrappier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You  usually don’t associate the summer months with collegiate athletics.  But for a number of reasons—one big one being the Olympics—the summer of  2012 was different for Harvard athletes. Here are just a few of the  memorable moments from an incredible three months, in no particular  order.
Legendary Baseball Coach Joe Walsh Passes Away
On July 31st the Harvard athletic community was shocked and saddened by the news of the sudden passing of one of the most energetic and popular  characters to grace the Crimson with his presence. Not only did Joe  Walsh’s passing affect current and former members of the Harvard  baseball team, but it inspired former crimson editor Martin Bell to  write a heart-warming and saddening tribute to the man who cared much more about who you were than what you did or where you came from. Rest in Peace, Coach.
Esther Lofgren ’05-07 and Caryn Davies ’04-05 Win Gold
Coming  into the Olympics, the USA women’s eight was riding a five year  unbeaten streak that dated back to Davies’ gold medal winning row in the  2008 Beijing Games. Fellow alum Lofgren narrowly missed out on making that boat in 2008, but in London the pair made good and defended the title, taking home the only golds of the Olympics for former Harvard athletes.
Malcolm Howard ’06 Wins Silver
Joining  the pair of Radcliffe rowers on the Olympic podium was legend of the  sport Malcolm Howard. The most successful Crimson rower and the namesake  of the 1V’s boat, “Malcolm,” Howard returned after winning gold in  Beijing to help take home silver for Canada in the men’s eight.
Henrik Rummel ’09 Wins Bronze
Rummel and his boatmates—a crew that had never raced competitively together before these Olympics—earned a spot on the podium with their performance on the water at Eton Dorney. 
Henrik Rummel ’09 Stands Erect on Olympic Podium 
Strangely, it was what transpired on the podium that will stand out in the  memories of most onlookers. Rummel rose to internet fame for this fateful picture that displayed his manhood to the world.
Temi Fagbenle ’15 becomes youngest member of Team GB women’s basketball team
The  results on the court for Fagbenle and her Team GB teammates left  something to be desired, as they went winless in group play before being  eliminated from the competition. But Fagbenle’s presence on the court was notable in and of itself.  After  sitting out her freshman year due to NCAA eligibility issues, Fagbenle  became the youngest player to make the women’s basketball team for the  hosts, and the only current Harvard undergraduate at the Games.
Andrew Campbell ’14-15 comes third at senior world championships
Andrew Campbell took time off last spring to pursue a spot on the US Olympic team,  and though he came up just short his success at such a young age earned  him rower of the year honors from USRowing. After the Olympics were  over, Campbell returned to the international circuit and, still  eligible to compete in the U-23 championships, finished third at the 2012 senior rowing championships in Bulgaria.
Men’s Basketball Team tours Italy
Coming  off the best pair of seasons in program history, the men’s basketball  team toured Italy this August in a series of pre-season matches against  Italian professional squads. The Crimson came away 4-0 as sophomores Wes Saunders and Kenyatta Smith shined, hinting that good things are still to come for coach Tommy Amaker’s side.  
Men’s Heavyweight Crew wins Ladies’ Plate at Henley Royal Regatta
Though  the Olympics are the pinnacle of the sport, there is nothing more  classic to rowing than the Henley Royal Regatta every summer on the  Thames. This year, the Harvard men’s 1V went head-to-head with the famed  Leander Rowing Club in the final of the Ladies’ Plate Challenge beating  the Brits in a furious sprint in the last 50 meters.
Alex Meyer ’10 and Samyr Laine ’06 fall short in their respective competitions, win over fans with their incredible stories
The two most inspiring Harvard Olympians came up just short in their pursuit of hardware at London 2012. But Laine’s campaign to promote athletics in his parents’ homeland of Haiti and Meyer’s  commitment to swim for his fallen friend Fran Crippen touched the hearts  of people around the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a season-opening 0-3 performance at the Hokie Invitational, the Harvard women’s volleyball team turned things around at this weekend’s Harvard Invitational, finishing the tournament 2-1 and grabbing second place.
In front of a boisterous home crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday night, the Crimson (2-4) routed Manhattan (1-6) in straight sets. On Saturday, Harvard swept Providence (1-12) in the afternoon but fell in three sets that evening to Northern Kentucky (9-1).
“One of our goals in practice this week was to speed up our offense and just everyone play together as a team,” said senior setter Beth Kinsella, who handed out 58 assists and recorded 13 digs this weekend. “[The Hokie Invitational] was challenging, but I think we really worked hard this week and were able to focus on those things in practice.”
Captain and outside hitter Taylor Docter, sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters, and freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace each earned a spot on this weekend’s All-Tournament team.
Junior right side Erin Cooney, who missed the majority of last weekend’s tournament after injuring her finger in the Crimson’s opener, was back in action and finished the tournament with 11 kills and five digs.
NORTHERN KENTUCKY 3, HARVARD 0
Against the Norse on Saturday night, the Crimson lost three tight sets, 25-21, 25-21, 25-23.
“This type of fast offense with…the fast middles is something we’re not used to,” said Wallace, who recorded seven kills in the match. “Now that we’ve seen it, we can better adjust, [and] we know what to prepare for in practice.”
Northern Kentucky led throughout the first set, grabbing a 21-19 lead.  Norse senior middle hitter Shelby Buschur then recorded three straight kills to give her team match point. And following two Harvard points, Buschur closed the set with another kill.
In the second, Northern Kentucky responded to an 18-13 deficit with a 7-0 run to take the lead, which the Norse never relinquished.
In the final set, Wallace put the Crimson in good position to win, notching a kill that put Harvard up 22-20. But Northern Kentucky came storming back with two straight kills and never gave up the lead again.
Walters led Harvard with nine kills. Kinsella had 17 assists, while sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey had 14 digs.
HARVARD 3, PROVIDENCE 0
Earlier in the day, Harvard got a three-set win against Providence, 25-20, 25-13, 25-16.
Harvard went up, 7-2, in each of the first two sets and never trailed the rest of the way, grabbing a 2-0 lead. But in the third, the Crimson tailed 14-11 before closing the game on a 14-2 run.
Docter led the game with 10 digs and freshman setter Hannah Schmidt added a team-high 19 assists.
Wallace, who had a game-high 12 kills against the Friars, attributed part of the Crimson’s success to its ability to get ahead early.
“I felt like we came out very strong compared to the other games in the past,” Wallace said. “We were calm, ready to play.”
According to Wallace, Walters’ service game was crucial for Harvard.
“[Walters’] serving was very phenomenal,” Wallace said. “When you have a strong server in the back row, it gives…the team confidence to play well, and it helps us build momentum.”
HARVARD 3, MANHATTAN 0
In Harvard’s home opener on Friday night, the Crimson routed Manhattan in straight sets, 25-18, 25-14, 25-14.
“We got our system going, obviously,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We did a nice job of controlling the pace of the match.”
Early in the opening set, the teams went back and forth. But with the score tied at 10, the Crimson went on a 10-2 run and eventually closed out the set on a Wallace kill.
“I think we served more aggressively,” Weiss said. “Those first couple points, you’re just kind of feeling out what the opponent’s doing.”
The first set had seven ties and two lead changes, but the next two were not nearly as contested. The Crimson built a 10-2 lead in the second, and closed out the frame with an 11-point win. In the third, Harvard used a 9-0 run to take a commanding 22-10 lead before closing the match with a 25-14 win.
Docter led the Crimson with 13 kills, while Casey notched 14 digs and Kinsella added 24 assists.
Despite Friday’s rainy weather, a noisy crowd trekked to the MAC to support the Crimson.
“It’s awesome that everyone comes out,” Kinsella said. “Sometimes you hear what they’re saying, sometimes you don’t, but regardless…playing at home is the best.”

September 5, 1940: Off-Campus Entertainment Varies from Girls' Colleges to Local Bars
Confidential Guide and official literature to the contrary, Harvard students do not concentrate exclusively on studying, trying out for the football team, or going to see the Dean. A good deal of a freshman's spare time is spent on the campuses of neighboring women's colleges, and in bars, dance halls, night clubs, theaters, and restaurants of Greater Boston.
Last year an exhaustive poll of the senior class taken for the Senior Album revealed, among other useless information, that the class of 1940 rated girls' colleges in the following order of popularity: Radcliffe, Wellesley, Smith, Vassar, Bennington.
Radcliffe, Harvard's little sister, is the traditional butt of Harvard humor. The typical Radcliffeite is pictured as a bony female wearing flat-heeled shoes, and horn-rimmed glasses, and carrying half a dozen textbooks; usually her slip is showing. But the vote of the Class of 1940 seemed to belie that conception—or else last year's seniors liked them that way. Radcliffe is conveniently close, the girls are generally more intelligent than at other colleges, and they don't mind riding subways or sitting in the balcony. At the beginning of the year the Radcliffe Houses hold "get acquainted" teas. If you're too shy to go by yourself, you can get someone who knows the ropes to take you.
September 8, 1980: Race Report Meets the Real World
It took the College committee on race relations almost two-and-a-half years to compile its 138-page report, the first in-depth examination of interracial contact in a college environment. The student-Faculty committee, chaired by Archie C. Epps III, dean of students, issued forth pages of recommendations, all aimed at making the College, in the committee's words, "more forthright in expressing its support for the minority presence at Harvard and the necessity of good race relations on campus."
Now that the report is out and the College is in a position to act on the recommendations, administrators and students are raising questions about, respectively, the newness and merit of these proposals. Administrators who will play key roles in bringing about the changes recommended in the report—such as increasing the number of minority faculty members, tutors and proctors, promoting minority admisions and introducing Core courses on ethnic groups—say these recommendations offer nothing new; they are simply a reaffirmation of goals the College has pursued for several years.
September 7, 1986: Food, Glorious Food
"It's good to be king," deadpanned funnyman Mel Brooks, in his movie "History of the World, Part I."
There has yet to be a Part II to that less-than-classic flick. But if anyone were ever to produce a "History of Harvard" movie, a line that would be worthy of inclusion in the script would be, "It's good to be a rich alum."
While undergraduates living on campus during the academic year are forced to ingest such upscale prison fare as broccoli-cheese pasta, scrod that never had a chance, and produce that would make a P.O.W. think twice, alumni living in the Houses are being feted to meals fit for a French Sun King.

In an election season as Crimson-tinged as this one (even the "New York Times" felt the need to report on the presidential candidates' shared alma mater), it should come as no surprise that Harvard researchers are behind a 2009 political psychology study that's been trending across the blogosphere for the past several days. Their findings? That Mitt Romney is the new McSteamy. Herewith, your questions answered.
Q: Since when is Mitt Romney hot?
A: Since before people knew who he was. According to Assistant Professor Ryan D. Enos of the Government Department, who conducted the 2009 study, he and his team of researchers gleaned their findings from a pool of undergraduates in California in 2007. Though Enos claims that their preferences are consistent with those found in any large group—Americans or foreigners, young or old—their West Coast location helped minimize familiarity with the faces of the faraway politicians whose images were flashed. To further reduce the role of bias in the undergraduates' judgment, Enos and his team took out any faces the students recognized. When asked to judge the competency of political figures based on appearance alone, these students put Romney in the 99th percentile of governors.
Q: Romney vs. Ryan?
A: Ryan, a supposed hottie, was in the 67th percentile... awkward. Though the two men were in separate categories within the study (House Members and Governors) and Enos said the point of the research was not to rank politicians, he also said that sometimes there is a clear winner. "My assumption is that if Mitt Romney is in the 99th percentile of governors he's probably way better looking than Ryan," Enos said.
 
Q: So what about Obama?
A: Too recognizable; not included in the study. Biden, however, placed in the 62nd percentile. "Better looking than average. But not as good looking as Ryan or Romney," Enos explained.
 
Q: How will this effect the 2012 election?
A: It probably won't. "Only under very particular circumstances, among a small group of [independent voters] will you see this effect," Enos said. In fact, the researchers found that not once in the 15-year period they examined was attractiveness or perceived competence enough to change the outcome of a senate race.
So for what it's worth, you now have the respective hotness levels of Romney and Ryan. On our side, we're hoping it's worth very little.
