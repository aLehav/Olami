After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The art of a good Golden Globes monologue is delicate and elusive. When ignored, the structural racism and sexism that plagues the very industry being lampooned overshadows any attempt at cheer; when mishandled, the same occurs. And the monologue has to be absurd — but often that absurdity generates itself organically, which is a large part of what makes the Globes such a feckless joy in the sea of gloomy, irresponsible, and unrepresentative escapism that is awards season. The last decade has variably fulfilled this mandate. Below is a ranking of the ten most recent monologues — from 2011 to 2020, the content of which covers the actual decade, from 2010 to 2019 — discerned with tools of rigorous science.
10. Ricky Gervais, 2020
Other than slandering the good name of Dame Judi Dench by suggesting she partakes in feline anal sampling like her “Cats” character, there was nothing particularly egregious about Gervais’ monologue this year except its unfunniness. The jokes about Martin Scorsese being short? Tired. “James Corden as a fat pussy?” Witless bully-comedy. Awards shows are stupid and don’t matter? Sure, so stop hosting them. Gervais is at his worst when he gets lazy, and he clearly phoned it in this year: In his own words, “it’s the last time, who cares?”
9. Ricky Gervais, 2012
In 2012, it seemed quite possible that Gervais had not actually seen any of the movies or TV shows in contention except for “Bridesmaids,” for which, Gervais riffed, “the cast spent the weekend with Dame Helen Mirren.” Other targets included Justin Bieber, Kim Kardashian, and Gervais’ own vocabulary, penis, and Hollywood Foreign Press Association contract. Credit where credit is due: Gervais landed a joke about the inanity of James Cameron a year before Tina Fey and Amy Poehler would announce themselves with a quality zinger at the same target. But otherwise, Gervais’ 2012 monologue fell flat largely because it wasn’t about much of anything.
8. Jimmy Fallon, 2017
Following Gervais’ signature rambling roast style in 2016, Fallon, historically the nice guy of late-night, tried for a more methodical approach — and took swings outside the ballroom at President Trump with jokes about the popular vote and Putin. The result was short and sweet enough, but it was hard to overlook the tinge of Fallon’s desperate attempts at reinvention after his infamous hair-tousling interview with Trump lost him both viewers and respect. Ironically, Fallon’s funniest joke had nothing to do with the election and playfully joshed our digital corporate overlords instead. With Jeff Bezos in the audience, Fallon remarked, “He actually arrived yesterday, but there was no one around to sign for him.”
7. Ricky Gervais, 2016
“I’m gonna do this monologue and go into hiding,” Gervais promised us at the opening of his not-so-triumphant return to the Beverly Hilton stage. Somehow the HFPA found him again this year, which was disappointing. Not much of Gervais’ material landed in 2016, in particular his extended riff on Jeffrey Tambor’s balls that has only become more grotesque with time and context. Gervais did manage a solid class critique of equal pay in Hollywood — for Jennifer Lawrence, he joked, “there were marches on the street with nurses and factory workers wondering, ‘How the hell can a 25-year-old live on $52 million?’” that showed a glimmer of the bubble-popping satire Gervais became famous for. His best jokes have always drawn on Hollywood’s discomfort with its own foundational, elitist truths.
6. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2015
Fey and Poehler’s performance in 2015 was a perfectly serviceable version of the formula they had perfected over the previous two years – the tight, 10-minute set, the roaming collection of indiscriminate zingers, the alternating roles of set-upper and deliverer. Their 2015 monologue is this far down the list only because the novelty of their distinct roasting genius had worn off slightly by their three-peat. A long-winded joke about the many noble accomplishments of Amal Clooney, Average Joe George Clooney’s wife, has the honor of being the second-funniest joke Fey and Poehler ever made about George Clooney at the Golden Globes. (See 2014.)
5. Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg, 2019
Drawing on Samberg’s signature roast style of disarming kindness, Oh and Samberg came on board to gamely play, as they called themselves, “the two nicest people in show business.” Anxious laughter gave way to warm, appreciative guffaws as the two took turns dishing out snappy compliments to stars and to each other for their savage takedowns. From calling Amy Adams a “mega-talented piece of dog crap” to renaming Michael B. Jordan “Michael B. Buff AF,” two very uncontroversial people parlayed their neutrality into serious laughs without hurting any feelings. Was it the funniest monologue of all time? No, but it did feature Sandra Oh telling Amy Adams to “take your lumps,” and you’re lying if you didn’t chuckle at that.
4. Ricky Gervais, 2011
That organic absurdity which only the Globes can deliver, cutting through awards-season ennui like a butter knife? We got it in 2011, when Gervais’ prolonged absence in the middle of the show led many titillated watchers to believe that he had been fired mid-show for a monologue joke about corruption in the HFPA. Or maybe it was the one about homosexuality and Scientology. Nevertheless, in the early-ish days of Twitter, the public intrigue of a host gone missing added an unexpectedly delicious wrench to the night’s proceedings. Gervais’s jokes were meaner than usual — and received the full wrath of the discomfited Hollywood elite — but for the audience watching palpable drama unfold at an otherwise predictable ceremony, the spark was worth the hits. Gervais should have quit while he was ahead.
3. Seth Meyers, 2018
As #MeToo swept Hollywood, Seth Meyers put on a dapper suit and did his very best. The mood of the evening was best encapsulated in Meyer’s first real joke about the outpouring of allegations: “For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months it won’t be terrifying to hear your name read out loud.” Meyers, drawing on his chops of late-night civic critique, managed to blend the politics of the nation with the politics of the rich and famous. He arguably benefitted from a collective, socialized distaste for many of his targets: Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein, and Donald Trump all made the cut. Still, an unsteady industry needed a methodical takedown of its villains, and Meyers delivered.
2. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2014
The Platonic ideal of the Globes speech in some respects, Fey and Poehler’s second go-around had nothing to prove. What they mastered here was the art of the cut-away: a jaded, sunglasses-wearing Julia Louis-Dreyfus sitting in the film section; a “Poehler” close-up that cut to a beaming Jennifer Lawrence. In the post-Gervais era, audience participation became fun again. 2014 also saw the best Clooney joke of the decade: “[‘Gravity’ is] the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.” Fey and Poehler excelled in cheerfully decimating the ranks of Hollywood’s untouchable white men with the power of two well-established white women, and that’s as close as we’ve ever gotten to the backdoor send-up Hollywood deserves.
1. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, 2013
“When it comes to torture, I trust the woman who spent three years married to James Cameron.” With that joke emerged a new dynasty. This night established a legendary rapport between two comedians at the peak of their cultural powers, with Poehler thriving in the “Parks and Recreation” era and Fey riding the wave of “30 Rock”’s critically acclaimed six-season run. The duo managed to be both meaner and funnier than Gervais ever was, lulling the audience into a false sense of comfort before dropping the guillotine and leaving everyone else’s heads spinning. The night’s precipice of praise and takedown landed all the more raucously because no one expected it. The magic would be conjured again, but never like this. Thankfully, we’ll get one more round of the best to ever do the dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge and Harvard police officers apprehended an armed man and woman in Central Square Thursday afternoon in response to reports of an armed individual in Harvard Square.
After police responded at around 3:20 p.m. to a report of a man with a gun near The Garage on 36 JFK Street, Cambridge Police Department officers searched the area and eventually located the suspect and a woman accompanying him near the Chipotle Mexican Grill in Central Square, per CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
CPD wrote in a press release that Chayanne Velazquez, 28, of Dorchester, Mass. was taken into custody after he lifted his shirt and revealed a firearm tucked in his waistband following a verbal altercation with a group of men. Another suspect with Velazquez — Stephanie M. Ford, 25, of Lynn, Mass. — was also taken into custody after CPD officers found a gun inside her backpack.
Harvard’s MessageMe system sent out an alert about an armed individual at 3:36 p.m, informing University affiliates to take shelter. Several minutes later, CPD tweeted about the presence of a “possible person with gun."
“HUPD and CPD officers responding to a report of a male with a gun in the area of Smith Campus Center.  Shelter in place. If outside go inside a Harvard building. If in a building stay where you are,” the Harvard alert read.
Warnick confirmed the details of the incident in an interview with The Crimson Thursday afternoon.
“A person had reported that a man lifted their shirt, displayed a firearm on their waistband, and then fled the area,” Warnick said. “The male was described as mixed race, was wearing a vest with the colors red, white and blue, and that was over a white-hooded sweatshirt and black-rimmed glasses.”
Velasquez faces charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and carrying a firearm without a license, according to the release. Ford faces charges of carrying a loaded firearm without a license.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard Law School students disrupted a first-year student recruitment event held by corporate law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP Wednesday night, calling on the firm to stop representing the oil and gas company ExxonMobil in ongoing climate change litigation.
Harvard Corporation member Theodore V. Wells, who works as a partner at the firm, was a lead lawyer for ExxonMobil. The firm did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the protest.
Shortly after the firm’s speaker came on stage, a group of students revealed a banner reading “#DropExxon,” according to a press release about the protest. They also chanted over the speaker, “We, students of Harvard Law School, will not work for you as long as you work for ExxonMobil. Our future is on fire, and you are fanning the flames. If you want to recruit us, then drop Exxon and join us in fighting for a livable future.”
First-year law student Carly Margolis said in the release that the students intended to send a clear message to the partners at the firm.
“Every year, Paul, Weiss holds receptions to recruit students like us – the future lawyers they need to stay on top of their field,” Margolis said. “So we came today to send a clear message to the partners at Paul, Weiss that as long as they are working to shield the corporate polluters wrecking our climate, we won’t be working for them.”
Third-year Law School student Hannah N. Perls said in the press release she was excited to see first-year law students engage in activism.
“I’ve been at Harvard for almost three years, and in my experience, direct action like this is incredibly rare at our school, with some notable exceptions,” Perls said. “The fact that students are overcoming the culture of complacency that dominates law school is truly a big deal, and gives me hope that real change is possible.”
Wednesday's protest does not mark the first time Law School students have protested a high-profile firm.
In 2018, law firm Kirkland & Ellis announced it would no longer require associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements — contracts that require employees to resolve workplace disputes with employers through an arbitration process, rather than through the courts. The announcement came after the Law School student group People’s Parity Project — then named the Pipeline Parity Project — called for a boycott of the firm until it removed the mandatory agreements.
Similar demonstrations calling on Paul Weiss to drop their representation of Exxon also took place at Boston University and Yale University.
Tyler Creighton, who is a second-year law student at Boston University, said in the release that he was proud to stand with the Harvard Law students.
“I was proud to join in solidarity with the Harvard Law community at tonight’s historic action and look forward to spreading this critical movement to Boston University and other law schools to end the legal industry’s defense of our climate’s destruction,” Creighton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz will join President Donald J. Trump’s impeachment team, helping with his legal defense during the forthcoming United States Senate trial.
Dershowitz confirmed he will be a part of the impeachment team on Twitter, writing in a three tweet-series that he will present oral arguments at the Senate trial to address constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal. He wrote that he is non-partisan when it comes to the Constitution.
“While Professor Dershowitz is non partisan when it comes to the constitution—he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton— he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution,” Dershowitz wrote.
A renowned civil liberties lawyer, Dershowitz is known for representing high-profile and controversial clients. In the past, his clients have included wealthy Harvard donor and convicted offender Jeffrey E. Epstein; football star O.J. Simpson, who was accused of murdering his wife; and billionaire socialite and convicted murderer Claus von Bülow.
Dershowitz will defend Trump as he faces trial in the Republican-held Senate against charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate trial began Thursday after the House of Representatives voted to impeach the president last month.
Prior to the full-House vote, Dershowitz declined to say whether he had been contacted by Trump’s legal team or asked to help with aspects of the president’s impeachment defense.
“I can’t confirm or deny,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson in December.
Leading up to the House vote, Dershowitz’s attendance at a White House meeting led to speculation over whether or not he would join Trump’s legal team. In December, Dershowitz confirmed to Reuters that he met with Trump at the White House earlier that week, though he would not disclose what the two discussed.
“I feel very strongly that the proposed articles of impeachment endanger the Constitution and endanger the separation of powers,” Dershowitz told Reuters. “But I can’t comment on any particular role I might play.”
He is also the author of a 2018 book “The Case Against Impeaching Trump.”
Other members of Trump’s legal team for the impeachment trial include former independent counsels Kenneth W. Starr and Robert Ray, both of whom were involved in former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial. White House Counsel Pat A. Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, Trump’s personal lawyer since 2017, will lead the team.
Aside from Trump’s legal representation, much else about the Senate trial remains in question, including whether witnesses will bring new evidence.
