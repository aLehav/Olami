From the sensuous piano introduction, “Love for Sale” by Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett is a joyous jazz experience, eliciting images of smoke-filled cocktail lounges and big-band elation. The swing chart is the second song from the album of the same name, featuring the music of jazz legend Cole Porter, which is set to be released on Oct. 1.
“Love for Sale” is the second studio album collaboration between Lady Gaga and Bennett, following the success of “Cheek to Cheek” in 2014, and their artistry is undeniable. Lady Gaga’s vocals are used to their full potential, demonstrating that she is not only at the top of the pop genre, but also that she is among the likes of legends Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday, both of whom covered the song in the 1950s.
Bennett’s crisp vocals and cool delivery show that suave has no age: At 95, he is still performing with the same swagger as he did at the beginning of his career half a century ago. On a more sincere note, “Love for Sale” is Bennett’s swan song, as he recently announced his retirement following his recent announcement of his battle with Alzheimer’s.
The song’s true magic occurs when the two sing in unison. Although octaves apart, their unison lines provide an eargasm of jazz sweetness. Combined with the bass line ostinato, high-hat offbeats, and saxophone interjections, the rich vocals soften the heart of even the most jaded listener, who won’t be able to resist tapping their foot or dancing in their chair.
Paying homage to the legacy of Cole Porter, “Love for Sale” is not only a masterpiece but also a testament to the power of a genre that many perceive as dying. Through their historic collaboration, Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett show the world that jazz is still sexy.

Ahn Ye Eun, a genre-bending singer-songwriter from South Korea, returns with an uncanny marriage of traditional folk and pop in her new single, “CHANGGWI (창귀).” In 2015, Ahn shook the Korean music industry when she presented original compositions that meshed the two seemingly incompatible genres in the popular music show, “K-pop Star 5.” This time, she offers an additional twist: horror.
“CHANGGWI (창귀),” is inspired by a Korean ghostlore of the same name, in which a man killed by a tiger turns into a spiteful ghost that hunts for additional victims. Contrary to most songs about the supernatural that are based on human impressions, Ahn decides to take on the role of the goblin herself. She narrates the tale from the perspective of a Changgwi, who must seek out the next victim and exchange fates in order to die in peace.
Ahn Ye Eun’s voice itself is as versatile as her soundscape is diverse. She maneuvers a range of vocal acrobatics — from intentional voice breaks to stylistic vibrato — to create a sound reminiscent of pansori, a Korean oral tradition. Her palette of techniques helps her vividly paint the story of Changgwi.
The piece starts out with sounds of a summer night — chirpings of grass bugs and distant howlings of wild animals — that are soon masked by approaching drum beats. Prefaced by a soft piano glissando, Ahn’s eerie voice begins the story: “Who’s there?” Changgwi hollers to the listeners, breaking the fourth wall. When his victim dwells to listen, he lures him closer, offering to drink and chat together. One of Ahn’s master strokes is surprising us with the story of Changgwi’s pitiful human life, an unexpected move that tenderizes the listeners into ambivalence. “Dear, won’t you help me?” he even begs, accompanied by a sob-like vibrato. Often, the background instrumental drops out and leaves us with Changgwi’s raw voice, reinforcing the conversational and intimate tone.
However, the listeners must not wallow in sympathy: The ghost’s excitement and anticipation of their doom are made palpable through the quickening beat, shrill voice, and the multiplying layers of chorus. In fact, Changgwi has already summoned the tiger to devour his victim as indicated by the toll of the gong in the second half, an artistically calculated foreshadowing. It isn’t long before Changgwi makes his motive clear: “I will take you,” he declares, his language and tone turning authoritative with the increasing confidence and certainty that we have fallen for him, the consequence of which is signified by the final death knell.
One of the most surprising elements of the song is the back-and-forth trade-off between similar-sounding instruments of different cultures: the use of both violin and ajaeng (a traditional zither that sounds like a violin) and traditional and modern drum. Her song bobs and weaves between not only genres but cultures and time periods as if defying the popular pressure to categorize her music. The ambiguity in both the story and style is what makes “CHANGGWI” so attractive. Ahn Ye Eun’s musical world is transcendental at the least, and this song is a perfect example.

On the first night of Governors Ball 2021, Kehlani poured all her heart and soul into her biggest performance so far this year. As the reverberating bass rumbled, the earworm hook of her 2016 hit “Gangsta” had fans singing along to “I need a gangsta / To love me better.” The all-female band and backup dancers filed onto the stage to hype up the crowd, looking stunning and powerful in all white. The icon herself took the stage just as the beat dropped, making the crowd go wild and kicking off the night on the right note. Kehlani looked ethereal and graceful, with only her neck and arms on display. The outfit accentuated her colorful array of sleeve tattoos.
That classy sexiness carried over into every aspect of her performance, from the setlist to the stage. As the colorful LED wall display in the background digitally altered her look, transforming her into wisps of smoke that blew away with the melody, Kehlani herself flawlessly switched between dance and song. “I’m gonna fuck my knees up for y’all,” she said, dipping down low to the beat of songs like “Can You Blame Me,” and “CRZY” as the air jets blasted from the stage. After sending a round of prayers and good wishes to Cardi B, Kehlani also gave a lively performance of “Ring.”
While the energy reached an all-time high in those moments, Kehlani toned it down to her more soulful low-key signature style for the majority of her set.
“I know y’all want to jump up in a festival, but y’all know I make R&B music, right?” she said, proceeding to serenade the crowd to the lo-fi beats of “Hate the Club,” “The Way,” and “Everybody Business.” Thematic lines from these songs like “Finna get antisocial on ya” facilitated the sonic transition from upbeat to chill. The interactive stage also matched the audio, with a 1968 Pontiac Firebird rolling on the screen behind Kehlani as she sang “I buy myself fast cars” off the track “Good Thing.” She also teased her upcoming sixth project, “Blue Water Road,” a week after its single, “Altar,” was released, dedicating the song as a heartfelt message to loved ones who have passed yet continue to walk among us in spirit. The smoke machine and spark fountains set a magical mood, complementing the introspective ambiance.
As if on cue, the sunset cast a rosy hue to complement the intimate vibe. Donning sunglasses, Kehlani basked in the golden-hour glow, making sure to let her band into the limelight as well, with individual spotlights and instrumental riffs that made all of the talented musicians stand out. Kehlani also took the time to interact with her friends as often as possible, sashaying stage left to stage right. She sassed up her performance with a shake of the hips and a shoulder shrug, working the crowd — leading to many teary eyes and bleary smiles from the fans in the front lines whom she graced with a wink or smile. In her performance of “I Like Dat,” she even got the fans involved in a collective dance lesson to T-Pain’s “crank that” move. “I don’t know if y’all know that I know that y’all know that I’m super gay,” she said, and then proceeded to dedicate “Honey” to all of the queer folk in the crowd.
The crowd witnessed a magical performance by Kehlani this Friday night, who put on a stage that not only stayed true to her R&B roots but also highlighted herself as a natural performer in a league of her own.

As fans crossed the bridge between Queens and Citi Field at the start of this year’s Governors Ball, they were immediately greeted by the booming bass of punk band 99 neighbors. From the moment the band took the Bacardí stage at the 2021 Governors Ball music festival, the energy amplified for every passerby. In baggy jeans and hipster bandana masks, their youthful and casual appearances complemented the set’s carefree attitude. The deep 808s reverberated through the crowd as lead vocalist Swank belted about heartbreak and the band’s DJ, Jared Fier, hyped up the crowd. The attractive swagger of singer Aidan Ostby caught every onlooker’s eye. Treading the line between hip-hop and pop, the rookie band delivered just the right sort of energy to kick the festival off right.
Indie pop sweetheart Tate McRae followed the duo, rocking Gov Ball’s crowds at the main GOVBALL NYC stage. A talented and award-winning dancer, McRae was a nonstop firecracker, dancing and moving in perfect synchrony with the sharp beats of her songs. Two backup dancers, donning black sweat suits and massive jeweled necklaces to coordinate with McRae’s own athleisure outfit, joined her for most of the show. The trio were captivating throughout, and the show’s highlights were doubtlessly when they united in bursts of perfectly executed choreography. For an up-and-coming artist, McRae commands the stage like no other, performing with confidence and candor. “This is really cool because the first festival I ever came to was Gov Ball,” she said, describing the 2018 festival, before her voice went out altogether. “Fuck sorry, I turned off my mic.” Like her, though, her songs appeared all but made for the massive festival. Not only did the crowd roar at every single song announcement, but her songs’ infectious pop beats made for great dancing. Her hit “You Broke Me First,” for example, was energetic from beginning to end, her delivery begging the audience to dance along with her.
After the pop shimmer of McRae and her dancers, soul singer Leon Bridges took the GOVBALL NYC stage to bring the audience some heartfelt ballads and funky bangers. Flanked by two backup singers in black and silver getups, Bridges’ own voice was the star of the set. Smooth and angelic, it rose above the stellar band and enthralled the audience. A welcome break from the rest of the day, Bridges created a space to step back and get down to some groovy beats courtesy of his drummer and percussionist. “Make some noise if it feels good to experience some live music again,” the singer-songwriter shouted into the crowd, greeted in no time by a rush of cheers and applause. His 2015 track “Brown Skin Girl” got the jazz treatment with an instrumental breakdown, allowing all of Bridges’ band to show off their musical chops to the song’s infectious beat that matched Bridges’ own energy. Dancing and swaying with the mic stand, he was a captivating performer who commanded attention on the festival’s main stage. A highlight of the set was his hit “River,” also from 2015. Listening to him play it, its slow tempo allowing his voice to soar, was nothing short of a religious experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In eighth grade, Karina L. Cowperthwaite ’23 was what she affectionately called “a little Delta Nu” in the ensemble of her high school’s production of “Legally Blonde.” Now, seven years later, she’s the director of Harvard’s production of the musical, which is a month out from opening night. This time, she has the power to stage the show in a new way: with a fully pan-Asian cast, acting on a stage coded for Asian identities.
Cowperthwaite became heavily involved in the arts from her first days at Harvard, acting in several productions and eventually proctoring the First-Year Arts Program. She was excited to find that college theater allowed her to explore her own artistic vision and learn from her peers’ ideas. “In high school, our drama teacher was the director, we had a professional set designer... and students were just kind of in it,” Cowperthwaite said. “Versus here, students direct the show.”
College also gave her the chance to more deeply explore the intersection between her art and her identity, especially through Harvard’s Asian Student Arts Project, of which she is now co-president. “I never used to put my identity and theater together,” Cowperthwaite said. “I sort of kept them separate, because a lot of theater is not written for people who look like me.” Now, she believes that uniting both aspects of her identity is crucial: “Through meeting other people who are passionate about going into theater professionally, I realized that your identity and what makes you different is actually really powerful, and [art] is inextricably linked to identity.”
One way that ASAP connects theater and identity is sponsoring productions every year on campus. But choosing a show is no easy task. When Cowperthwaite and her team sat down to choose a musical, they were immediately confronted with the frustrating reality of being pan-Asian in theater: seemingly limited options. “There are a lot of shows that portray Asian Americans in a pretty racist light, and in the mainstream culture, we don’t see a lot of representation of Asian stories,” she explained. “That’s really hard when you’re sitting down and you’re like, ‘I really want to put on a musical this semester,’ but there’s not really a musical out there that is contemporary and centered around Asian American identity... and is a fun Broadway musical that everyone knows.”
Choosing “Legally Blonde” started out of a brainstorm session. “As a joke, [my friend] was like, ‘What if we did High School Musical, but all Asian? Or Legally Blonde, but all Asian?’ Everyone was sort of laughing, because the idea was so ridiculous.”
“But what if? What if we took that seriously?” Cowperthwaite remembered thinking. She noted that in the larger theater community, reimagining traditionally white stories is becoming more popular. “So I thought, what happens if we do that at Harvard?”
From there, Cowperthwaite’s creativity and curiosity took off. As director of the production, her goal to create an authentically Asian space extends far beyond casting. She imagined the Delta Nus, but now singing music inspired by BLACKPINK. She rethought Elle’s iconic purse, now featuring a Hello Kitty design. Paulette’s salon is now set in Chinatown. “All of a sudden, the story looks completely different just by changing how we racialize the bodies on the stage and what spaces we’re exploring — and we didn’t even touch the text of the show,” Cowperthwaite said.
Interestingly, as Cowperthwaite pointed out, the script of Legally Blonde never specifies that Elle (or any other character) must be white: “It just says that Elle has to be blonde.” She leaned forward and smiled, as if she had a secret. “And in this contemporary culture, anyone can dye their hair blonde.”
Even though the script is not written for a specific racial identity, when performed by an all-Asian cast, the context behind the words is very different. In one of the admissions officer’s lines, for example, he disparagingly refers to Elle’s dancing as “ethnic movement.” “That line before maybe would have gone over people’s heads, but all of a sudden, when Elle is Asian... you’re like, ‘Ooh, that line is so pointed now,’” Cowperthwaite explained enthusiastically.
When the cast is pan-Asian, the plot points become more relevant to other identities, too. “Legally Blonde” follows Elle Woods on her journey to and through Harvard Law School, attempting to prove her critics wrong as everyone doubts her right to be there. Cowperthwaite believes that Elle’s story isn’t just relevant to white audiences: “I think the narrative of Elle Woods coming to a school and feeling like she does not belong is a narrative that people of color can understand,” she said.
Cowperthwaite has high hopes not only for the performance itself, but also for its role in a larger effort to bring Asian voices to mainstream theater at Harvard and in the broader world. Still, she recognizes that truly equitable representation won’t happen overnight. “I think that ultimate, true representation in theater and the arts is having Asian American stories portrayed on the stage,” Cowperthwaite said. She believes this process is layered and complicated, and requires Asian American work to be established, funded, and normalized in mainstream theater culture.
“Right now, we don’t have access to that work yet,” she said. “Hopefully, we are the generation that is writing and making these new shows, but until then, we have this collection of fantastic musicals that are so fun, but often feel inaccessible to people of color because they feel like the characters were not written for their identities.”
As this next generation of theater-makers begins to make progress toward permanent change, Cowperthwaite believes that her community shouldn’t wait for representation. “Then, I just think about representation in another way. What if you take contemporary, popular musicals, and you ask yourself the question: What if we challenge the notion that these musicals, if they’re non-race specific, have to be coded for a white space?”
She pauses, and grins. “Enter ‘Legally Blonde.’”

In its latest season, “Sex Education” continues to be a delight. The show has clearly matured from its debut but maintains and builds on the clever plotting and stellar characters that made it famous.
Season Three is really about the gulf between teenagedom and adulthood — about making dumb and selfish choices and then owning your inevitable mistakes. It’s refreshing to see teenage characters treated with this level of nuance; they’re allowed to give in to their insecurities and lash out at each other without being vilified. Almost everyone in the season feels like a three-dimensional person with room and screen time to grow and learn.
Otis (Asa Butterfield) remains a fascinating protagonist. Awkward, empathetic, and a bit self-absorbed, he continues to mess up as he deals with love, sex, and friendship. Progress is not linear, so it’s great to see him falter without giving up on himself. Maeve (Emma Mackey), meanwhile, navigates her mother’s addiction and her sister’s stay in foster care, showing her growth even though she hesitates to accept support. Eric (Ncuti Gatwa) and Adam’s (Connor Swindells) blossoming relationship is also a highlight of the entire show — Eric has to reconcile his identity with his heritage and what he wants in the future, while Adam struggles to overcome his previous insecurities and accept who he is now. Their struggles are incredibly grounded and their chemistry continues to be electric.
Beyond the well-developed main characters, part of the mastery of “Sex Education” is its compelling cast of supporting characters. Lily (Tanya Reynolds) undergoes a short but complex arc about self-expression and self-esteem in the latter half of the season, allowing her to re-evaluate her passions. Ruby (Mimi Keene) also once more departs from the “mean girl” stereotype to reveal her tough home life and deep insecurities. While charming new character Cal’s (Dua Saleh) screen time is mostly utilized to introduce them and their new friendship with Jackson, hopefully future seasons will delve further into their ambitions and interests as well as their gender identity. Altogether, the season’s moving personal journeys cover a range of topics, from healing after trauma and finding solidarity to exploring one’s sexuality, breaking the cycle of abusive parenting, blending families, and accepting love — all treated with a caring tone that is affecting to see.
Additionally, “Sex Education” sets itself apart from other teen dramas through its treatment of the main characters’ parents: They are portrayed as complex, flawed people who do their best despite not always knowing the right thing to say. Otis’ mother Jean (Gillian Anderson) and Adam’s father Michael (Alistair Petrie) both struggle with their own midlife situations and have to grapple with the consequences of their choices. However, their grounded, moving portrayals stand in contrast to the portrayal of new headteacher Hope Haddon (Jemima Kirke), who is so cartoonishly evil that the occasional attempts to humanize her fail miserably.
While one weaker character is certainly understandable in such a massive cast, Hope’s presence in the narrative draws attention to some other flaws in the show. The setting is incomprehensible at times — it’s set at a British sixth form for 16-18 year olds, but the students act like they’re following an American curriculum, alongside dozens of cultural anachronisms that either feel like a wacky choice or the product of poor research. Similarly, with the exception of Maeve, there is very little economic diversity: Even Ruby (Mimi Keene), who is insecure about her home, lives in a large, warmly decorated house, especially for its rural UK setting. In fact, it fits alongside the houses of other characters, even if it’s less grand than some of the mansions. Where are the families living in council houses and run-down flats? After the exploration of so many characters across the show’s three seasons, the economic assumptions behind many of the characters are becoming a little conspicuous.
In Season Three, the colorful, distinctive absurdity of the setting established in previous seasons begins to crack. “Sex Education” clearly takes place in an exaggerated world that nonetheless tries to reflect our own. This duality naturally strays towards the ridiculous. The alien-orgy-themed “Romeo and Juliet” musical exemplified this absurdity at its best, but Season Three unfortunately leans into confusing plot points and fourth-wall-breaking acknowledgements of the craziness of their world, detracting from the show’s otherwise funny, satirical and clever tone.
However, despite these flaws, the show’s heart lies in its relationships. Instead of drawing teenage melodrama or dismissing adolescent feelings, the show exists in a refreshing in-between that acknowledges that all the main characters are changing and confused but still treats their feelings with the respect they deserve. Relationships matter, whether they’re fleeting or not. “Sex Education”’s exploration of that idea is far more powerful than the world-ending love narratives typical to Young-Adult media. Moreover, real-world relationships sometimes fail despite no one being at fault — “Sex Education” understands that, and the pain these characters are feeling is portrayed with moving authenticity.
Overall, the show stumbles a little with its worldbuilding, but gives voice to the messy, complex experiences of teens in the UK and beyond. The series’ focus always remains on the characters. Their stories are told with such intricacy and care that the moments of tonal confusion are ultimately just small distractions, ensuring the season remains a triumph.

Where, exactly, have all the bathroom soap dispensers gone? And why are they disappearing? As with most things today, the answer to this mystery lies with TikTok. Along with soap dispensers, students across the country have been stealing school property in the name of TikTok’s newest diabolical trend: “Devious Licks.”
As one Twitter user explains, “They did it. They made theft a tiktok trend.” This user is right. Participating in the “Devious Licks'' trend is as easy as that: Steal a random object from school, take it home, and post a dramatic video removing the object from a backpack.
Know Your Meme identifies the start of the trend to be Sept. 6, when a TikTok user posted a video of a hand sanitizer dispenser with the caption, “only a month into school and got this absolute devious lick.” The video — since deleted — gained 2.7 million views in two days, inspiring thousands of users to post their own “devious licks.”
Hand sanitizer is a fairly innocuous and inexpensive thing to steal (although it definitely still constitutes theft — don’t get any ideas). But TikTok trends exist to go viral, and if there’s one truth in this life, it’s that people will do whatever it takes to go viral. The stolen objects, therefore, have only gotten more impressive: exit signs, printers, sinks, and bathroom stall doors. Basically, hand sanitizer is so two weeks ago.
Students in schools across the country are now scrambling to steal the biggest, baddest, most impressive object. These thefts range from minor annoyances — as one Twitter user lamented, “Every soap dispenser at my school has disappeared. I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS, PLEASE FIND THEM,” — to questionable school-wide punishments, such as shutting down bathrooms permanently. So a reminder to any aspiring “Devious Lick-er” — think of your community. Is stealing that bathroom stall door worth ruining everyone else’s day?
Prior to Sept. 6, most people hadn’t used or even seen this phrase. Now, “devious lick” is being used across social media, even outside of the trend. One Twitter user joked, “your honor my client did not commit grand larceny he just got an absolute devious lick.” Another tweet shared an image titled “[your heart]” with the caption, “My most devious lick by far.” Ah, the power of TikTok. Some middle schoolers steal a paper towel dispenser, and now we have a new saying.
Equipped with the virality of social media trends, this generation has, in many ways, a Shakespeare-like ability to come up with new phrases and speak them into reality (see: Bone Apple Tea). Trends go viral, and users use the trend to chase their five minutes of internet fame. Apps are flooded with the same catchy phrase, and in mere days, the trend completely permeates social media.=
So, how much staying power does “devious lick” have? Is it the newest permanent internet phenomenon? Or, like many TikTok trends of the past, will devious licks be forgotten by the end of the month? Due to the ebb and flow of social media nowadays, it’s hard to say for sure. But next month, if the 4th floor bathroom of Canaday A still has a soap dispenser ripped off of the wall, it’ll be certain: Devious licks are here to stay.

Students, Faculty Reflect on 100 Years of Harvard Business School’s Case Method
After last year’s Met Gala was cancelled due to Covid-19 restrictions, we finally saw a return on Sept. 13. Dubbed “fashion’s biggest night out,” this fundraising event for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City expects guests to match the theme of the Costume Institute’s annual exhibit. This year, invitees celebrated “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion,” the first of two sections of the exhibit on American fashion, by following the dress code of “American Independence.” Here we’ve picked out the top five looks of the night.
5. Quannah Chasinghorse 
Quannah Chasinghorse, a 19-year-old Hän Gwich’in and Oglala Lakota model making big splashes in the fashion world, wore a stunning shimmering gold dress by Peter Dundas from his recent Dundas x Revolve American Dream collection. Her gold lamé cut-out dress was complemented by a cape of the same fabric billowing away from her. In line with her desire to highlight her Indigenous culture, Chasinghorse paid homage to her connection to the Navajo Nation, where she was born and raised for some time, by wearing traditional turquoise Navajo jewelry loaned by her aunt Jocelyn Billy-Upshaw, a former Miss Navajo Nation. With this dazzling number and wonderful reminder of the nation’s first peoples, Chasinghorse marks a strong start to this list.
4. Saweetie
Saweetie absolutely shined in a custom salmon-colored dress that Christian Cowan reportedly designed in twenty-four hours. Tight, barely-there, and draped around her body, a diamond chain held up the incredible dress that involved the placement of 10 million crystals. Saweetie required a team of eight people and eight hours to get dressed and complete the look down to her matching hairdo peppered with sparkles. Saweetie aimed to pay honor to her heritage with two long trains flowing away from her dress, one bearing the design of the Black American Heritage flag and the other the Filipino flag, which Saweetie said is “what makes me an American girl.”
3. Amanda Gorman
Harvard’s very own Amanda Gorman ’20, the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history, comes in as number three. Donning a deep ultramarine blue Vera Wang gown with a sweetheart neckline and a lovely tulle train, Gorman evoked both the American flag and the Statue of Liberty. The sparkles of her dress were a wonderful complement to the wave of stars sweeping off her face, which also brought to mind a billowing flag. In place of the Statue of Liberty’s tablet, Gorman held a clutch in the shape of a book by Edie Parker that reads “Give us your tired,” referencing a line in “The New Colossus” by Emma Lazarus inscribed at the statue’s base. For the statue’s crown, Gorman instead referenced her status as a laureate with a crown of laurels. While it would be nice if the dress were the green color of oxidized copper we know and love, Gorman’s ensemble is nothing less than statuesque!
2. Grimes
The second best outfit of the night is none other than Grimes in a piece by Iris van Herpen that required over 900 hours to create. With a hand-casted, laser-cut bodice in silicone that transitions into waves of 26 meters of hand-pleated and gradient-dyed silk rippling away from her body, Grimes was nothing short of captivating. What isn’t to love about this futuristic look, from the smokey fabrics streaming away from the corset to her matching silver mask, earpieces, and headdress? To top it off, Grimes sported a bejeweled face and towered in sky-high lace-up 2017 Marc Jacobs platform boots. Ultimately what clinched this look were her three props: a chrome mask taken from the film adaptation of “Dune,” a glowing book, and a large sword made from a melted-down Colt AR-15A3. How American!
1. Anok Yai
Coming in as the look of the Met Gala is Anok Yai, an American model discovered via a photograph gone viral, in a lovely black number from Oscar de la Renta’s Spring 2022 collection. Does anything really need to be said about the sheer magnificence of this dress? Yai, donning a plunging black dress hand-embroidered with countless star-shaped diamonds, was a perfect snapshot of “New Old Hollywood.” With matching embroidered sheer opera gloves, a massive, feathered boa that simply swallows her figure-hugging dress, and a pixie cut, she shines like the stars decorating her dress. This dress was reportedly inspired by Josephine Baker, an American-born singer, dancer, and member of the French Resistance and civil rights activist. This ensemble was nothing short of stellar.

After the sun went down on Saturday at the Governors Ball music festival, headliner A$AP Rocky emerged from the crowd half an hour after his call time. Unbeknownst to the anticipating fans, he and his crew, A$AP gang, secretly infiltrated the photo pit wearing ski masks moments prior to the show, which caused the confused festival goers to think there were terrorists among them. Seconds later, a mosh pit swarmed around A$AP, so a brigade of security guards had to escort him back to the stage to start the show. The introduction was made even more confusing by the background of fireworks which some fans mistook for A$AP’s entry, but in fact originated from the adjacent Grubhub stage which J Balvin was closing out.
But that was only the beginning of what turned out to be an even stranger sequence of events.
When A$AP finally decided to show his face, he emerged clad in his signature American flag, a white balaclava, and an array of crossed out swastikas and confederate flags on his hoodie sleeve. His outfit paled in comparison to the accompanying video playing in the background, which depicted erratic flashes of test images and hallucogenic warning signs in addition to political propaganda that garnered trigger warnings for flashing images. After he opened up with unreleased protest songs “Fuck 12” and “No ID,” A$AP proudly declared that this was his very first time performing in New York. His cheerful screams could be heard from miles away from the fully soundproof stage, especially when he had to stop mid-song to yell at the crowd to open the mosh pit up, which happened multiple times before the security woke up and realized that that was their job.
Some other notable events of the night included A$AP promoting the drug LSD before performing the song “L$D,” during which he winked at someone who may or may not have been Rihanna, and threw out his controversial sweatshirt to some lucky fan in the crowd. At the sound of air horn and cannon sound effects — both of which played after every song without fail — A$AP performed fan favorites like “Babushka Boi” and A$AP Ferg’s “Plain Jane,” so that even those in the audience who weren’t already fans had to turn up. A$AP also teased unreleased songs one after the other, including soundcloud hits like “Mushroom Cloud” and “Baby Talk,” enjoying the fans’ reception so much that he couldn’t seem to stop. It got to the point that the festival staff had to come drag him off stage because the festival was closing.
After many unsuccessful attempts at begging to stay on stage, A$AP left his stage ten minutes over time to the sound of “Yamborghini High” and the undying cheers of his befuddled fans. Although it had its ups and downs, without a doubt, this Gov Ball headliner performance was one for the books.

For the hip-hop head, Virgo season has been an exciting period of musical output. While the rest of the world debates “Donda” versus “Certified Lover Boy,” London rapper Little Simz has jumped across the pond to win the September album drop series with her stunning new release, “Sometimes I Might Be an Introvert.” Amidst the clamor of rap’s heavy-hitters, Simz’s homage to the underdog rises to the top and serves as a masterclass for any aspiring (or established) artist on how to turn beats and sounds into a work of art.
While Simz’s strong suit has always been her ability to string together language to form hard hitting bars, “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” transforms her from an artist who can just rap well to one who can build a narrative. In a genre that so often rewards those who are the loudest and most brash, “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert”stuns in its technological subtleties and details while celebrating the real-life introverts who do the same.
While many may not know Little Simz by name, those who are active in the TikTok cinematic universe will more than likely remember her viral song “Venom.” The track is about women being overlooked in rap, and the trend associated with a 16-second snippet of that song that made it into the TikTok audio (“Never givin’ credit where it’s due ‘cause you dont like p*ssy in power / Venom”) is primarily women discussing their subversions of the patriarchy. Little Simz amplifies these messages of empowerment on “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” and extends them to the women who global movements so often leave behind.
The album is a love letter to Black people broadly, and Black women specifically — honestly reflecting on the international struggles that accompany Blackness and womanhood and the beauty that arises out of the pain. This is literally shown on the second track, “Woman,” where Simz line-by-line calls out and praises the women of the diaspora’s nationalities by name. This sentiment is further echoed in other tracks like the intro song, “Introvert,” where Simz reflects on the societal expectations of silence that many Black women face regularly and simultaneously raves about their strength and wisdom.
What makes the album especially powerful is Little Simz’s willingness to embrace her own struggles with these themes. On “Little Q, Pt. 2,” Simz reflectes on a stabbing her cousin suffered and the dangers of systemic violence in her London neighborhood. While a less methodological rapper may share the story and move on, Simz reckons with the implications of the interaction. She refuses to fully victimize her cousin or condemn the perpetrator, but instead casts a direct condemnation on the racist societal structures that underscored the violence. She wrestles with this same conflict between individual responsibility and social pressure on “I Love You, I Hate You.” Underneath a beat repeating those words, she raps about her relationship with her father and how she refuses to forgive his lack of parenting but is growing to understand him as an imperfect man with his own trauma and challenges.
While every song delivers lyrically, Little Simz amplifies her words with incredibly diverse, consistently strong production. In just the first three songs, Simz moves from a bold marching band, FAMU Marching 100-esque underscore on “Introvert,” to a swinging jazz line on “Woman,” and ends on “Two Worlds Apart” with a sample from Smokey Robinson's 1975 ballad “The Agony and Ecstasy.” The rest of the album sees Simz sample children's choruses (“Little Q, Pt. 2”), transform corny Ed Sheeran-style guitar chords into a suave beat (“I See You”), and reveal herself as a Nigerian PinkPantheress complete with disco synth and fluffy vocals (“Protect My Energy”). Few artists can offer that level of versatility without sacrificing cohesion and consistency. What the listener is left with is a series of songs that can stand alone but shine even brighter together.
The primary fault of the album lies in its spoken interludes. Thinking back to some of the most iconic album skits like SZA’s badass Grandma or Frank Ocean's drug-fearing “mom,” a successful skit will follow roughly three components: be short and sweet, be strongly connected to the message of the album, and not be corny. The skits on “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” fall short on rules one and three. “The Rapper That Came to Tea,” the longest of the three full length skits, sits at an unbearable two minutes and forty-five seconds. Most of the plots are conversations between a god-like character telling Simz that she can do anything she sets her mind to. This is all underscored by a mythical beat with 10 too many flutes that could also serve as the background music of Wizard101. Simz almost infatalizes her listener by spoon-feeding them the album's messages that she has clearly alluded to in the better parts of the album.
Skip the interludes, however and the album is left with 16 stunning songs. This body of work is the perfect combination of music and message; it is simultaneously empowering and fun to listen to. Fans of any rap subgenre should be a fan of Little Simz, because she gives a taste of everything to the listener without overwhelming. On the back of three strong albums, Little Simz had nothing to prove, but instead of complacency, “Sometimes I Might Be Introvert” is a victory tour of one of the great rap talents of the generation. The album is not perfect, but it does more than enough to solidify Little Simz as the queen of UK rap — and a strong contender for album of the year.

After a year and a half of pandemic entertainment, MTV’s Video Music Awards (VMAs) came back in full force on Sunday, Sept. 12. Hosted by the singer and rapper Doja Cat, this year’s VMAs pulled in over 3 million viewers across television, and millions more online. The night proved a success for artists like Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo, and BTS, who all swept up a number of awards across categories.
However, the true spectacle of the VMAs was the over-the-top, indulgent, Twitter-mob-inducing performances given by this year’s top artists. The main show featured 19 different musical performances, ranging from the dramatic heart-wrenching theatrics of Kacey Musgrave to the angsty, confusing vocals of an inexplicably hooded Justin Bieber. While there were no Chainsmokers-at-the-2016-VMAs level catastrophes, here are the top five performances to watch from the 2021 VMAs.
5. Normani (“Wild Side”)
After her phenomenal performance of “Motivation” at the 2019 VMAs, fans and critics alike had high expectations for this performance. Normani, no stranger to intense choreography, outshined the competition quite literally in her all-silver outfit, but also with her cool and confident stage presence and vocals. However, despite ending the performance amidst audience hollering while draped over a strapped-down Teyana Taylor, Normani’s set didn’t quite yield the same energy and audience engagement as other performers throughout the night.
4. Doja Cat (“Been Like This” and “You Right”)
From her “The Ring” inspired rock performance of “Say So” to her classic “Chicago” aesthetic medley, Doja Cat has proven herself to be one of the most versatile and creative performers at major award shows. This year’s VMAs performance did not disappoint, steering away from overused pyrotechnics in favor of a simple ring of light and a suspended harness for the singer. She also left out her typical army of backup dancers, in favor of two accompanying dancers engaged in narrative choreography. Doja Cat released her artistic energies in this meld of acting and vocal performance, subverting the classical VMA performance for this visual spectacle.
3. Busta Rhymes and Spliff Star ("Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See," "Scenario," "Touch It," "Pass The Courvoisier," and "Look At Me Now” Medley)
Hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes and hype man Spliff Staff injected the show with new energy in a surprise performance. Clad in bright red and white, the duo brought audience energy back with a medley of throwback beats and a strobe-light aided concert atmosphere. Busta Rhymes, who delivered some of the most impressive verses of the night, solidified his status as a music industry and hip-hop icon. His performance perfectly recalled the root of the VMAs: MTV’s 1980s and ‘90s dominance in the cultural paradigm.
2. Chlöe (“Have Mercy”)
Chlöe, of R&B duo Chlöe x Halle, turned heads with her solo performance debut of “Have Mercy.” Donning a pink shroud and illuminated by spotlights, Chlöe began the set with the theatrics of a horror movie, building a cohesive graveyard-esque theme. Her performance combined the classic flashy, highly-choreographed VMA performance blueprint with an explosion of personality. Expressive and dramatic, Chlöe strutted across the stage, showing off her stunning vocals on her hit single.
1. Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow (“Industry Baby” and “Montero”)
King of internet controversy (and arguable PR genius) Lil Nas X took the stage with Jack Harlow in the best performance of the night. Their performance translated the 120 million view Youtube music video for “INDUSTRY BABY” into a live spectacle, complete with hot pink Montero prison uniforms and the highly tweeted shower scene. The adaptation of the music video into a high-energy, live performance set is quintessential to MTV’s VMAs, which have struggled to find their identity in the age of Youtube. Jack Harlow graced the stage with his signature swagger, and Lil Nas X’s performance of both of these highly memorable songs displayed unmatched showmanship and was the high point of the night’s strong performances.

Country music won’t be saved in the studio. It won’t be saved on the radio and it won’t be saved by the charts or a trending TikTok sound. No, country music will be saved by live performances. No artist knows this better than Charley Crockett, an independent and prolific country singer from San Benito, Texas. As country devolves into a greasy mimicry of pop music, Charley Crockett and his peers keep country’s soul alive with the waltzes, ballads, and steel guitar picking that made it a genre foundational to American music today. On Sept. 15, Crockett brought that sound up to Boston for a one-night taste of the cornucopia of honky-tonk sound.
Nobody does it like Charley Crockett. With full trumpet fanfare straight out of a western movie, Crocket mounted the stage like a cowboy mounts his trusty steed, unironically opening with his original, “Run Horse Run.” The “hiyahs” from the stage drew a thunderous roar from the crowd of country lovers who came out on a Wednesday night for the genre that seldom tours this far north. Crockett’s full western garb was matched by his theatrical playing style. Holding his guitar like a trophy in front of him, he shuffled across the stage in suave, dramatic steps. More of a strummer than a picker, Crocket wore his guitar high on his chest to adorn his traditional attire. With his shoulder against the instrument like a rifle stock, the singer looked down the guitar neck like he was looking down a barrel site — a sharpshooter of sound. It’s the dedication to the look and sound that separates Crockett from the rest. Anyone can wear boots and a cowboy hat, but to own the brown monotone outfit — keeping the suede jacket on all night, with the cartoonishly placed guitar — is a premeditated dedication to the spirit of the west.
A four song spree of original music helped to keep the high energy entrance alive. The drawback of an hour-and-a-half set in a typical honky-tonk Nashville bar is usually the repetition of chord progressions and sound in either short, punchy songs or long, drawn-out, sorrowful ballads. But Crockett’s originals are layered with the influence of blues and old-time folk sounds that filled up the room and frequently changed the pace of his performance. Nevertheless, Crockett is well known for his covers; his Billy Swan cover of “I Can Help” and Tanya Tucker cover of “Jamestown Ferry” are some of his most streamed releases. After his opening run he welcomed the crowd to the show and introduced his next songs as an homage to one of his country inspirations: James Hand. While he did release a ten-song James Hand cover album, “10 for Slim,” this year, the cover interludes that would happen throughout the show is where the show settled. Crockett shared some advice from Hand, “Anybody can pray for rain, you best be digging a well son!” If the well is an extensive cover repertoire, for better or worse, Crockett has dug it.
But even the longest stretches of slowed down honky-tonk, strum-along songs were kept engaging by the masterful skills of Crockett’s band, the Bluedrifters. Steel guitar player Nathan Fleming stayed on stage all night, playing alongside opener Lucas Hudgins, ornamenting every song with both classic and progressive steel guitar licks. But instrumentalist Kullen Fox stole the show for anyone paying attention. Fox provided all the musical intricacies of the show as trumpet player, piano player, mandolin player, and accordion player — sometimes playing two instruments at once! His passionate trumpet solo during “Trinity River” took the hearts of the crowd and rivaled the onset applause of the encore.
Crockett ended his show with a 5-piece string band playing old-time folk tunes. Returning to the stage with banjo strapped to his chest, looking out on an audience chanting his name, Crockett signed off the night with an ultimate homage to original country, old-time bluegrass. While it may take a few years for country singers like Crockett to take Saturday night headliners in Boston, a sold-out Wednesday night show might be an indicator of the return of country to the mainstream Crockett fans already see coming.

While Amazon Studios’ latest film centers around the art of ballet, “Birds of Paradise” is fundamentally about desires and ambitions that speak to the deepest parts of the human experience. Sarah Adina Smith, the director of the dance-driven psychological thriller, strove to create a narrative that transcended the sphere of ballet.
“It’s a movie where friendship and love and lust and obsession all get kind of tangled together,” said Smith in an interview with the Harvard Crimson. “It's where ambition and libido collide.”
The film follows two rival ballerinas and best friends competing for the prize contract at the Opéra National de Paris. Kristine Froseth of “Looking for Alaska” costars as French ballerina Marine Elise Durand — the former star pupil who has returned to reclaim her spot after a tragic loss. Enter Kate Sanders, played by Diana Silvers (“Booksmart”), a spunky American ballet dancer with a fiery spirit for competition. The pair make a pact to both earn the contract, aiming to defy the rule that only one male and one female dancer may win the prize. However, the girls are ultimately forced against each other as their ambition threatens to shatter the friendship they have formed and the undercurrent of desire beneath.
When asked about the intent behind the movie’s themes, Smith said she explored several key questions: “‘Can you achieve greatness at the highest levels and still be good? What do you sacrifice along the way?’ What makes humanity interesting is that we're always reaching for greatness and always reaching… for the beyond,” she said. “At the same time, how do you do that in service of perhaps some higher truth rather than just validation or your own ego?” In this time of great change, Smith explained, we have re-evaluate the values and beliefs we hold, a theme that she hopes is reflected in the movie.
Choreographer Celia Rowlson-Hall worked hard to utilize the medium of dance to express themes that a larger audience could understand. She aims to capture the humanistic quality of movement within dance and transform it into a visual language that we can all understand.
“I always want there to be a bit of humor and relatability,” said Rowlson-Hall. “I want dance to feel like we can all do it.”
The film also challenges the traditional male and female archetypes found within classical ballet, where roles and even dance steps exist within strict gender binaries. “If you want to succeed, you had to fit in those boxes,” Smith said. In “Birds of Paradise,” the two protagonists are striving for greatness within these bounds — yet they are also still discovering who they are, who they hope to be, and who they want to be with. Ultimately, the characters must decide whether to break free from this mold, their career goals conflict with their search for self.
The drama of the film is carried by its leading actresses Diana Silvers and Kristine Froseth, whom Smith characterizes as exceptionally talented and very different.
“Diana is passionate and fiery and competitive… and Kristine is a deep well, a very old soul.” Smith spoke to the excitement of watching the actresses’ chemistry come alive on screen after working with each other separately. “Now all of a sudden, they're colliding, which was really fun. It felt like a chemistry experiment.”
The choreography for the main characters parallels this sentiment. Rowlson-Hall described how she used dance to illustrate central facets of the characters’ histories. Marine’s movements were light, precise, and traditionally feminine, whereas Kate’s felt strong and athletic.
“I want to take in everything that the writing is giving me as to what defines these characters,” Rowlson-Hall said. When she read the script for the first time, it was clear to Rowlson-Hall that she and Smith were going to work well together.
“When you get the right people for the project, there's a certain sort of alignment that happens that you don't have to force or work on,” she said. “I understood her vision and what kind of work she wants to put into the world.”
Smith echoed the sentiment: “Filmmaking is so collaborative,” she said, calling it the best part of directing. “When you're writing, you're kind of all alone, by yourself. And it's a lonelier, more tortured process. And so to get to go from that to a process of pure collaboration is really exhilarating.”
The creative minds behind “Birds of Paradise” were more than prepared to tackle the big ideas of the film. Their mutual trust and creative chemistry aligned magnificently to produce this ambitious and surreal work of art.

Like the razor blades hidden in the sweets he hands out, the titular villain of “Candyman” offers a surprisingly sharp story about black suffering. Directed by Nia DaCosta as a sequel to the original 1992 cult classic, and produced and co-written, along with DaCosta and Win Rosenfeld, by Jordan Peele –– director of “Get Out” (2017) and “Us” (2019) –– the film follows in the footsteps of Peele’s earlier work as it weaves together horror and racial commentary. Though initially flawed in its unimaginative structure, “Candyman” evolves into a harrowing portrayal of the weaponization of trauma.
Opening with upside-down shots of the Chicago skyline alongside the portentous hum of a beehive, the film starts with the usual horror tropes. Ominous, metaphoric use of animals? Check. Consistently gray Midwestern sky? Check.
The rest of the first act proceeds in a similarly unsurprising fashion: Following a generic prelude in which Candyman presumably terrorizes a young child in the slums of Chicago, the film cuts to the present-day gentrified neighborhood. Anthony McCoy (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), a once brilliant, but now uninspired artist, lives with –– and off of –– his girlfriend Brianna (Teyonah Parris), an art gallery director who displays his work. Although the dialogue between characters is refreshingly natural and believable –– an exchange between Brianna’s brother Troy and his fiancé is rife with stutters, um’s, and the halting rhythm of real-life conversation –– the scenes feel rehashed, as if they are there only to depict the stereotypical nearly-perfect-life of the nearly-perfect-couple upon which the horror of the film will soon descend.
When Anthony unwittingly invokes Candyman into being by saying his name five times in a mirror, the film finally starts to reveal its intermittent genius. Horror clichés are still present, such as an animated retelling of the legend of Candyman and banal shots of Googled research on a library computer, but they are used more sparingly. Instead, the film’s intelligence shines via cinematographer John Guleserian’s creative and meaningful framing and DaCosta, Peele, and Rosenfeld’s suddenly energetic, allegorical method of storytelling mid-movie.
The latter half of the film visually stuns with inventive shots. A slow, sardonic zoom-out of a multi-windowed Chicago skyscraper shows a victim violently dragged across her room by an invisible Candyman. Startlingly unbalanced compositions depict Anthony resting on –– and simultaneously encaged by –– the modern apartment walls in the buildings that make up his newly developed neighborhood. Finally, still shots of mirrors found in bathrooms, windows, and painting canvases, unify each scene around the film’s themes of self-reflection and self-representation. Purposeful storytelling drives the framing of each shot, and the care and originality Guleserian brings to this department successfully masks the overall staleness of the plot.
As Anthony hears about the origins of Candyman from laundromat owner Billy Burke (Colman Domingo) –– who is the grown-up version of the young boy in the prelude –– the audience learns that the true “face of fear,” as Billy puts it, is not the leering, crucified figure of Candyman, but the white police officer who reacts to young Billy’s screams by beating Candyman to death. Far from narrowly serving as a tragic character hell-bent on revenge in supernatural form, Candyman comes to represent five black, male victims of white/police brutality from the 1800s to the recent past. Those who invoke his name in order to feel self-complacent –– all of whom are white –– suffer a gruesome, bloody, and over-the-top death via Candyman’s hooked arm. Their deaths are an exaggerated brutality that at first comes off as typical eye-roll-inducing slasher content; however, through the script’s masterful, though delayed, movement toward the metaphorical, they transform into reverse punishments inflicted on modern-day, insidious racists.
But is Candyman ultimately a vengeful character? Does he exist solely as a representation of black pain and suffering, a symbol for centuries’ worth of resentment? And are white people the only people who can inflict suffering in a racial context?
The second half of the movie confronts these questions directly as characters’ personal past traumas unravel to complicate the web that the script has slowly spun. Some of the later plot twists may be predictable, but Abdul-Mateen, Parris, and Domingo’s provocative portrayals of pain and terror –– and special mention must also be given here to Vanessa Williams, who delivers a heartbreaking performance as Anthony’s mother –– make the film novel and worthwhile, as it otherwise struggles to break the genre mold of a traditional slasher. Although it takes a while, “Candyman” eventually reveals its latent originality, coming to life and leaving the audience absolutely devastated.

Dedicated fans of Sally Rooney, touted as the literary voice of the Millennial/Gen-Z generation, have, by now, largely learned what to expect from the inimitable young author. Like Rooney’s previous hit novels “Conversations With Friends” and “Normal People,” her third release “Beautiful World, Where Are You?” follow a familiar formula, featuring young adults embroiled in a convoluted friendship/love situationship. This time around, four individuals are involved: Alice, a writer, is romantically entangled with Felix, who works in a factory. Alice is best friends from college with Eileen, who is romantically entangled with Simon, a childhood friend and crush.
Some aspects of the repetitive story are more than acceptable — craved, even. For example, readers can’t seem to get enough of Rooney’s sex scenes (notoriously well written and titillating), nor the way her men are written — exemplifying the female gaze in the most authentically Millennial/Gen-Z way possible. The men are always desperately in love with the protagonists, and express their deep yearning explicitly and out loud — which is what makes them so achingly appealing. “It’s the old life of quiet desperation for me I’m afraid,” Simon jokes about his relationship.
Other familiar facets, however, have become mildly frustrating the third time around. “Beautiful World” again alludes to queerness — Alice and Felix are both bisexual — and yet once more focuses most strongly on the frankly incredibly heteronormative relationships that all the characters engage in. Moreover, Rooney’s female protagonists are characteristically strong depictions of complex and multifaceted women, but “Beautiful World” strangely still places the men in savior positions for them. Both Alice and Eileen are often breaking down and Felix and Simon are nearly always calm, with the right words and knowledge to comfort and advise them.
The style of the novel feels fairly experimental — understandable for a writer like Rooney, who was raised to ‘genius’ status from her debut. At times, however, the novel feels “a little loose and dissociative,” to steal words from the writing itself. The style flips dizzyingly back and forth between poetic abstraction and minimalist dialogue, and the omniscience of the narrative perspective is never definitive, leaving readers with Rooney’s usual insight into characters’ psychology at times, and then purposeful ambiguity at others.
The emails with which much of Alice and Eileen’s friendship and interiority is revealed are interesting insights into Rooney’s classically hyper-intelligent political and social contemplations — but can also feel, at times, like mostly a mechanism for Rooney to express her own ruminations.
The emails do create an interesting contrast juxtaposed with the much more distanced and clinical writing found throughout the rest of the book. The contents of the threads are what make “Beautiful World” even more angsty and existential than its predecessors — in one, Eileen writes that the only idea on the internet seems to be to “watch the immense human misery unfolding before us and just wait for the most immiserated, most oppressed ppl to turn around and tell us how to stop it.” Rooney has been praised for her unparalleled depiction of the unavoidable Millennial/Gen-Z ethos of helplessness, cynicism, and anxiety in the face of capitalism and human suffering and the systems of oppression in the world. She is nothing if not ‘with the times,’ and the increase in volume of explicit discourse on these subjects perfectly reflects the changing social and political winds amongst young people in the last year.
Rooney’s works do more than reflect the world around the writing — they seem to unabashedly reflect her own life and journey as well. The characters in “Beautiful World” are far more mature and settled in themselves, with none of the frantic searching their counterparts in “Conversations with Friends” or “Normal People” are engaged in. Alice, Eileen, Felix, and Simon are grappling with mental health in a more explicit, mature way than Marianne and Connell ever were. They are thinking about faith, despite their deep cynicism towards religion, and finding something beautiful and compelling about it. Here, Rooney’s skill for capturing a typical young, liberal, non-religious individual’s skepticism and simultaneous hunger for meaning truly shines through. Felix reacts to the idea of Simon’s faith with the comedic, absurd confusion of “He’s weird in the head or something, is he?” Alice and Eileen seem similarly, though more quietly, inclined, yet are able to appreciate the bits of religion that are beautiful and help people.
Despite being the most radically cynical and deeply anxious, “Beautiful World” is also undeniably the most hopeful of Rooney’s novels in the end. She has alluded to a defense of art, love, and human connection in the face of all the evil in the world before, but this third novel takes a far more unabashedly optimistic tone than before. She — her characters — are particularly and appealingly earnest and honest in their acceptance of their humanity, their desires, and their flaws. The world is full of awful things, points out Rooney — and yet we go on, and our lives are beautiful still.
“The state of the world being what it is, humanity on the cusp of extinction, here I am writing another email about sex and friendship,” writes Alice. “What else is there to live for?”

Despite having the word “climate" in its title, the panel hosted by The Green Ribbon Commission on Sept. 14 did not focus on intimidating graphs of data or dizzying green technologies; rather, the discussion sought to shed light on the dire need for a conversation on climate and the environment in artistic, social, and cultural circles.
Even though all of the speakers had various experiences and titles under their belts, they all shared a climate of conscientiousness and a deep belief in the need to connect across disciplines to holistically solve problems. The event was initiated by Amy Longsworth, the director of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, who was interested in more artistic contributions to scientific quandaries.
"I'm very much a student of the idea of natural processes and how a person is stimulated to care enough to want to make a change about something,” Longsworth said. “The long game is to get people feeling strongly enough that they are going to be demanding change, demanding their political leaders to take stronger, faster action, demanding more changes in their personal life, just having a deeper understanding of what they can be doing.”
After making initial remarks and introductions, Longsworth passed it to the first presenter, Brenda Tindal. Tindal is the executive director of Harvard's Museums of Science & Culture, with a colorful background in scholastic history and education including work at the International African American Museum and in the Detroit Historical Society. She highlighted the "Climate Change" exhibition at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, as well as the upcoming Spring 2022 exhibition, "In Search of Thoreau's Flowers." The exhibition is posed to strike at the intersection of themes such as climate change, nature, and loss.
Tindal also brought the conversation full circle and connected this seemingly purely artistic exhibit back to civil rights and ultimately climate change. She discussed how the interdisciplinary nature of Thoreau's work influences our discussions on climate change today, citing how, despite Thoreau's main occupation as a naturalist, he still wrote "Civil Disobedience."
“In many ways, his ideas were endemic to some of the conversations around abolitionism in the 19th century; at the same time, he is also talking about nature and the impact of human activity on nature,” Tindal said. “[Thoreau's] iconicity, his example of navigating multiple discourses, serves as very interesting examples of both the past and the present, and how they deeply inform one another.”
Karen Mauney-Brodek, the President of the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, spoke about her organization’s Canopy classroom initiative. The mission of the program is to speak with elementary school students from the Boston public school system to educate them on the environment in an engaging and interactive way. Mauney-Brodek highlighted the growth and passion demonstrated by everyone involved with the project. She also reinforced the main theme of the panel, speaking of the necessity to connect on a human and emotional level even when speaking of technical solutions.
“Fighting climate change is a highly human exercise, but often it starts to seem quite abstract,” Mauney-Brodek said. “The work that we started doing, with the ‘Olmsted Now Effort,’ really tries to center on ‘how do we connect more people and how do we support communities that are coming together to make really important changes in their neighborhoods.‘”
The final panelist was Garrett Nelson, the President and Head Curator of the Norman B. Leventhal Map Center. Nelson's background was quite interdisciplinary — as was the norm for this panel. As a historical geographer, he spends his time elucidating the relationships between community structures, geographic units, and political ideologies. Similarly to the previous speakers, Nelson also gave a preview of the Leventhal Center's upcoming exhibition on "Environmental Justice in the Human Landscape."
The final section of the panel consisted of questions from the audience. Though held over Zoom, the back and forth between panelists and the public felt natural and upbeat. Overall, the event highlighted the need for interaction between creative and scientific sectors when it comes to solving problems. The discussion displayed the role that cultural and creative institutions (especially parks and museums) continue to play in our lives.
"In my view, museums are not merely cabinets of curiosity,” Tindal said. “Museums are places where visitors can be activated and encouraged to apply what they learn to make the world better than how they found it."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Greta Gerwig, despite only solo-directing two films, has become a mighty force in the industry. With additional experience in acting, screenwriting, and producing, her list of accolades has grown into the hundreds, including Oscar nominations for the coming-of-age masterpieces “Lady Bird” and “Little Women.” She is beloved by audiences, aspiring filmmakers, and actors alike, admired for her creativity and — most importantly — kindness.
Given the amount of praise that Gerwig has received for her skill in screenwriting and directing, it may come as a surprise that she never attended film school. After graduating from Barnard College with a degree in English and Philosophy, Gerwig’s cinematic education came from acting in a niche known as “mumblecore” — low-budget independent films with narratives that prioritize dialogue and focus on the lives of young characters. It was not until she acted opposite Ben Stiller in the 2010 film “Greenberg,” written and directed by her now-partner, Noah Baumbach, that she achieved any mainstream recognition. The roles that followed allowed her to master and ultimately move beyond the art of playing the quirky best friend, culminating in the critically acclaimed 2012 film “Frances Ha,” which she starred in and co-wrote with Baumbach.
Gerwig made her solo directorial debut with “Lady Bird” in 2017. The film reflects her mumblecore roots, portraying a distinct version of American youth in her hometown of Sacramento with realistic dialogue and simple cinematography. As an actor-turned-director, her creative process relies heavily on frequent communication and interaction with the actors on set. She has a knack for bringing out an actor’s best performance, encouraging the integration of their own personality with that of their character. This openness extends to Gerwig’s efforts to keep the set playful, evidenced by a video of her directing Saoirse Ronan and Lucas Hedges on “Lady Bird.” Gerwig and crew members belly laugh as she passionately shouts “Collapse a little bit closer! Collapse that way! Go run! Yes!”
The atmosphere of Gerwig’s sets is so supportive that it keeps renowned actors coming back and attracts new stars as well. Both Ronan and Timothée Chalamet returned after “Lady Bird” to star in her second film, an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women.” Much like her directorial debut, the film explores the intricacies of family relationships and the difficulties that arise with growing up. The success of “Little Women” lies in Gerwig’s attention to detail. She spent hours with the star-studded cast to get the pace of conversations just right. They rehearsed the overlapping lines that mimic the chaos of large family discussions until, almost like a piece of music, everyone knew exactly when to interject.
Another example of Gerwig’s nuanced vision is the use of warm and cold filters to convey the time frame of different scenes. Those that take place during the March sisters’ childhood are cast in a warm filter, which Gerwig wanted to reflect the joy and innocence of youth. In contrast, a colder filter is laid over the scenes that show the March family later in life, disillusioned by the transition into adulthood.
Gerwig’s spin on the 19th-century tale was even more unique by its engagement with the queer subtext of Alcott’s original work. The director told “Advocate” that she chose to emphasize the gender fluidity of Jo and Laurie, made more noticeable by their exchange of vests and other items of clothing throughout the film. Gerwig also wanted to highlight the undertones of bisexuality in Jo’s character, accentuating the moments when Jo expresses her desire to love who she loves without bounds.
In many ways, some more intentional than others, Gerwig has become an advocate for women’s progress in the film industry. First and foremost, her films tell the stories of women in a remarkably raw and unrestricted way. “Lady Bird” places the empowerment of women and importance of female relationships at its forefront, and “Little Women” embodies the frustration that women feel toward societal limitations and pressures. Gerwig writes female characters who are both vulnerable and strong, encouraging independence while also recognizing the fundamental desire to love and be loved.
When Gerwig was disappointingly left out of the Best Director category at the Academy Awards in 2020, the snub brought more attention to the lack of recognition of women directors. Much like Jo, her creativity was undervalued in comparison to her male counterparts. Gerwig is an example of how far women behind the camera have come, but also of how much progress is yet to be made. Her directorial skill, brilliant screenwriting, prioritization of a comfortable workplace, emphasis on the importance of women’s stories, and experience balancing a thriving career with motherhood makes Gerwig an inspiration to female filmmakers everywhere.
Gerwig’s upcoming projects include another collaboration with Baumbach on a film called “White Noise,” as well as a live-action “Barbie” starring Margot Robbie.

Need something other than “Halloweentown” to kick off your October? James Wan’s crime horror, “Malignant,” is a well-produced mix of gore, whodunnit murders, and science gone horribly wrong. What the film lacks in wit and dialogue — especially when it comes to the last few scenes — it makes up for in satisfyingly thrilling plot twists and commendable special effects.
Wan is best known for his work in the horror genre, with films like “Insidious” and “The Conjuring.” After a short break from the genre, where he directed action films like “Furious 7” and “Aquaman,” Wan announced that “Malignant” would not just mark his return to horror but an experience that offers genre-bending twists to modern fans. Introducing telenovela-level dramatics and perhaps some unintended comedy to an otherwise classic horror movie was definitely a risk, but it was not necessarily a bad one. A viewer’s response will depend on what one is expecting.
The film opens with a sci-fi cliché: scientists and doctors in a shady lab being attacked and murdered by an experiment that went AWOL. The supposed-doctors lack all the seriousness of typical ‘secret scientists’ and are killed off in an dramatized, outrageous fashion typical of a ‘90s horror parody. The remaining doctors regain control of their patient Gabriel (Ray Chase) and deliver the unironic line “time to cut out the cancer” directly into the camera — of course, not before Gabriel vows to “kill them all.”
A few shots later, we meet main character Madison (Annabelle Wallis), a pregnant woman in an abusive relationship who fears yet another miscarriage. Things progress quickly, and within seconds, her husband Derek (Jake Abel) attacks her, making her bleed from the back of her head. Things then get even more creepy when we meet the hairy, contorted killer who descends on the young couple — snapping Derek’s neck and sending Madison again hurling through the air. And from here, things are pretty much as you expect: investigation, murder, jump scare, another jump scare, more investigation, more murder.
In sharp contrast to Madison’s traumatic experiences, the cops on the job again are characterized by the hapless and dramatized flare used to portray the mad scientists. Awkward flirting, sucking on lollipops as they draw up the case boards, the lead investigator Detective Kekoa Sha (George Young) making passes at Madison’s sister — it’s all straight out of a bad rom-com. The real comedy, however, does not stem from the stale sex jokes, but rather from watching our deranged and deformed killer Gabriel walk backwards over his victims. Now, it is understood that the bloody, murderous hairball that is Gabriel is supposed to be the big bad, our scary-spooky skeleton lurking in the dark. Call it broken Gen-Z humor, but there was something so bonkers about seeing the central villain crab-crawl through small doorways and do insane backwards parkour off of fire escapes in a police chase. Intentional or not, for a true fan of gore and terror, those moments were simply too funny to be scary. But who said a little laughter in your psycho-killer movie was bad?
The only part of this film that was truly disappointing was its ending, where Madison’s previously somber, terse character suddenly becomes powerful, talkative, and cheesy. While the buildup of tension is captivating, the plot twists satisfying, and the ending a happy one, the main character transforming from damsel-in-distress to Wonder Woman in five minutes is poorly executed. The ending can only be described as a rush job to get to a happy but utterly unsatisfying end. And here comes the unironic line for the third time –“time to cut out the cancer.” You get it? Malignant? Cancer, right?
Looking beyond this blunder, however, the film is remarkably well-made. A round of applause goes to the special effects crew; from Gabriel’s bloody, refigured face come to life to creating CGI liquified walls that surround the paralyzed Madison as the shot wraps around her, they go above and beyond. And despite how utterly hilarious Gabriel’s hobbling was to watch, one has to commend the efforts of Wan’s team — specifically the contortionist Marina Mazepa, who pulls off battle-royales both blind and backwards. As funny as they are at times, the skill required was apparent.
Wan’s execution is solid for all but the last ten minutes, and he made good on his promise to make “Malignant” a lot more fun and unique compared to today’s conventional horror films. If you go into this movie expecting to be scared out of your socks, you’ll be disappointed. But if you are looking for a chill, sometimes funny, sci-fi-inflected thriller, head on in and take your seat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University policy that has closed the Yard to the public every night from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. this semester marks a fundamental and detrimental shift in Harvard’s traditionally open campus culture — so too detrimental is this Editorial Board’s decision to call for closed gates to be a permanent fixture of our campus.
The only rationale the University has given for this policy, which will be lifted on Oct. 11 and was first piloted last fall, is that it is meant to “support the safety and health of our student population” in the first few weeks of the academic year. We see two aspects of health and safety potentially at play here — Covid-19 transmissions and students’ personal safety at night — and neither are fixed by this policy.
Harvard’s Covid-19 precautions do not prohibit students from bringing non-Harvard affiliated visitors into their dorm buildings, much less the outdoor spaces in the Yard. Yet restricting access to the Yard to only Harvard ID-holders for 10 hours of the day undermines this guidance and creates confusion about the University’s Covid-19 policies. Further, instituting these closures in the Yard alone renders any pandemic-related rationale inconsistent across campus.
Likewise, while the importance of prioritizing students’ personal safety at night cannot be understated, closing the Yard addresses the wrong aspects of the right problem. There is nothing inherently safer about a Harvard affiliate versus a Cambridge resident. Restricting which group has access to the outdoor space of the Yard does not necessarily translate to increased personal safety. In fact, campus sexual assault is far more likely to occur during interactions with an acquaintance than a complete stranger; this is a pervasive problem that closing the gates does not fix.
Increasing gate security also necessitates more interactions between security personnel — potentially law enforcement — and Harvard students and Cambridge residents, which The Crimson’s Editorial Board explicitly opposes. The action and institution of policing, and by extension, security as a whole, is inextricably intertwined with racism, brutality, and the cycles of incarceration and poverty that have colored our nation’s history. There is no way for a call to increase security around Harvard’s gates and the Editorial Board’s precedent calling for the abolition of the Harvard University Police Department to coexist. It is hypocritical to be against policing as a lofty, progressive gesture, but then support increased security when it comes to closing the Yard at night.
By closing its gates, Harvard is signaling that not only is it somehow not a part of Cambridge, but that those without a Harvard ID represent a threat that needs to be kept out. This lack of trust and openness creates a culture of division as tangible as the closed gates that physically split the Yard from the Square. Especially when considering the huge expansions Harvard is undertaking in Allston and nearby neighborhoods, it has never been more important for Harvard to be an active and equal member of the communities it resides in.
Our campus is at its most inclusive, most alive, and most beautiful when Harvard Yard and Harvard Square seem to bleed into one. After Oct. 11, unlike the rest of The Crimson’s Editorial Board, we look forward to seeing the gate restrictions disappear: Harvard University should never close its gates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So far this fall, Harvard Yard has not been a public space — not after 5 p.m., anyway. In what’s been described as an effort to protect the “safety and health” of the student population, the University has kept 21 of the Yard’s 25 gates closed from the late afternoon until 3 a.m. and will continue to do so through mid-October. Only Harvard affiliates with a University ID card are able to access the remaining four entrances.
The initiative has some undeniable benefits, particularly when it comes to student safety. Our peers, particularly female undergraduates, stand to gain from having a closed, safe space where they don’t have to keep their guard up after the dark. Crucially, the policy achieves this increase in student comfort without actually augmenting the police presence on campus — a frequently touted alternative that presents its own threat to student safety and perpetuates systemic racism.
The psychological comfort afforded by the reduced accessibility, the ability to take a lonesome stroll around the Yard at night, cannot be understated. This impact alone outweighs all other concerns and pushes us to support a permanent extension of the gate restrictions, albeit with some substantial changes to its current implementation.
First, the nighttime gate schedule must actually be during the nighttime. Its current span, from 5 p.m. to 3 a.m., is both too long and too early. We are skeptical that anyone feels unsafe in the Yard before dinner, and the early evening lack of entrances proves a hindrance to both students moving between classes and local residents seeking cut through Harvard property. A new, more limited schedule would be a better fit for all. Locking the gates from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m., for example, would hopefully reduce the impact on non-Harvard ID holders, and make our campus welcoming during the day.
The lock-down is also too restrictive in its current form, particularly when it comes to guests. Freshmen should be allowed to bring non-Harvard affiliates into the Yard at any time— it is, after all, meant to be their home. In the long run, that could be accomplished by digitizing specific entrance gates — local ordinances allowing — to facilitate unlimited, swipe-validated access for affiliates and their company.
We recognize that our newly locked gates and identification requirements add an extra layer of unforced elitism to our institution, distancing us from our neighbors and rendering our ivory tower even more inaccessible. The policy could risk exacerbating our local divide, splitting us into Cambridge residents who can cross through Widener’s gates, ID in hand, and those who cannot. To mitigate this regrettable risk as best as possible, our university should be open to and perhaps actively seek residents’ input on the matter.
The temporary closure of the gates has inspired an overdue conversation over who belongs at the Yard and when. The current model, set to expire within weeks, is imperfect, both excessively exclusive to guests and poorly scheduled. Yet its core tenet — that freshmen should have a guarded, Harvard-only Yard to enjoy during the night — is persuasive enough to warrant a second attempt. With some adjustments, our new closed Yard offers a blueprint to a safer, less intimidating campus after dusk — one we hope outlives the October deadline.

I’ve never considered myself a foodie, but I can’t deny that eating is one of my favorite activities. There’s something special about sharing a hot meal with people who equally warm your heart. Back home, my sister and I always gorge on homemade meals together over laughter-filled conversations or purposeless movies. Our meals together are some of my favorite memories and one of the things I was most afraid to let go of when preparing for my move to college. I did, however, feel comforted by the flood of anecdotes I heard about the unique freshmen dining experience at Annenberg which I hoped would fill the void.
I never realized how much of home I would actually miss in the dining hall. Whereas before, I could always count on my mother’s comforting food to make me feel at home after a long day, I am now always struggling to find comfort from the once-reliable friend I call food.
My food options have been severely limited since I’ve left home, the one place I always felt I belonged. I am a practicing Muslim who eats Zabiha Halal meat, a distinction that has placed me at a disadvantage in the Harvard dining halls. In Texas, there was no place I felt more comfortable dining than my own home because my family has always catered to our Halal dietary needs. My new home at Harvard has failed to meet this need.
While the College should, in essence, be my home base — the place where I can return with ease and fall back on — I constantly feel like an outsider when scanning my dining options. In contrast to the various entree lines available to most students, Halal residents are restricted to a small, de facto hidden section. As Harvard Islamic Society Co-President Aisha Abelhamid puts it, Muslims simply do not belong here.
It’s not that there are no opportunities for me to taste a piece of home; it’s that those options are sparse and overwhelmingly homogenous. We are offered Halal “alternatives,” which are rarely Halal versions of courses but rather downgraded substitutes. There are always chicken and meat options for most students but often only “Halal” vegetarian or fish options for Muslim students, which is really a poor excuse for an attempt at accommodation since vegetables and fish are always Halal. When we are provided with actual Halal meats, they often barely resemble their non-Halal counterparts. I have also had multiple experiences of waiting for a single Halal option in the entree line while numerous refills were brought out for non-Halal residents.
These same deficiencies haunt other groups with dietary restrictions — the same handful of rotating inadequate options offered under the pretense of inclusivity. How can we all feel welcome when our dining doesn’t truly accommodate every individual regardless of their needs? How can eating continue to be an enjoyable experience for all if some of us are continuously disregarded?
Equally as important as what we eat, however, is with whom we eat. The first time I stepped out of Annenberg’s kitchen and into the dining area, my eyes were so often fixed upwards at the fascinating architecture that I could trail off to any table and have a seat without another thought. My roommates and I liked to describe it as the magic of a new community forming, where anyone could sit with a stranger and strike up a conversation. Unfortunately, all magic comes with a price — or an expiration date.
Now, when I step out of line with my tray of salad and yogurt, I look straight ahead at the daunting game of mental Sudoku I must play to find a seat. With the jitters of the first month past us, most freshmen have settled into their groups. While it is wonderful that people have found peers that make them feel at home, it makes it that much harder to calculate who is open to another member at their table and who is in the middle of a conversation and may resent you for interrupting.
When you enter the dining hall with your group already in tow, Annenberg is bearable — you can overlook the food and focus on the laughter and the fancy chandeliers. But then you are in danger of appearing like those same daunting cliques to students who have just stopped by for a quick meal that didn’t line up with their friends’ schedules.
I am deeply frustrated with the clique culture — real or perceived — that I see in Annenberg. But I don’t think that it is impossible for us to keep the magic of Annenberg alive beyond the breathtaking Gothic arches and technicolor mosaics. It is fully in the hands of students to create a community that allows everyone to feel like they belong in the dining hall even if they walked in alone.
To me, the joys of food are two-pronged: the chance to please my palate and the chance to spend time with those I love. I can’t say I was not disappointed in both these ends at Annenberg. I have realized that it is hard to adjust to a new environment when you are missing such an essential part of home.
The dining hall should not be another place where we feel disconnected. It should be a place where both our stomachs and our souls are fed. I hope we can revive the spark in the dining hall and sanctify the reputation of Annenberg that I used to hear so widely about. I believe that if we try hard enough, eating can be an activity that means so much more than just nutrition; it can mean security, solace, and a sense of belonging.

Harvard Business School moved classes for all first-year and some second-year MBA students online for a week beginning Monday, following a spike in Covid-19 cases the school attributed to off-campus social gatherings.
In an email to all MBA students on Thursday, four HBS administrators wrote that the school has counted 121 cases among MBA students since July 1, with close to 60 students in isolation that day. First-year students made up roughly 75 percent of those positive cases.
“We are a complete outlier among Harvard schools in our numbers. MBA students comprise roughly 9% of the student population at the University, but have accounted for more than two-thirds of total student cases in September. Our positivity rate is 12 times that of the rest of Harvard,” wrote HBS Dean Srikant M. Datar, Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi, Executive Director of the MBA and Doctoral Programs Jana P. Kierstead, and Senior Associate Dean Jan W. Rivkin.
The University’s Covid-19 dashboard shows that over the past seven days, 60 of the 74 positive reported cases have been graduate students.
“These distressing figures are so high that they have attracted the scrutiny of local public health officials. Our community can and must do better,” the email continued, urging students to halt all unmasked, indoor social activities.
On Sunday, the same four administrators sent an email to all MBA students announcing that all required curriculum students — which consist of first- and second-year MBA students — and one section of elective curriculum students — which consists of second-year students — would be shifted to remote classes from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3. They also wrote that HBS students are now expected to test three times a week, mirroring the increased testing requirement for affiliates living in undergraduate housing announced earlier this month.
“None of us expected or wanted to take this step,” they wrote. “But if we make the step well, we hope to get back on track in a week.”
They added that the total MBA student cases this semester have jumped 20 percent in “just the three days” since their Thursday email. By shifting to remote learning for a week, they said they hope to stop further transmission until they can identify and isolate all cases, at which point the school will transition back to in-person activities “with a clean slate.”
The administrators noted in their email that the Business School is experiencing far more Covid cases than other Harvard schools.
“There is something about the way we at HBS interact that makes our MBA community susceptible to the Delta variant,” they wrote. “This seems unique to HBS; we have a far higher rate of infection than other Harvard schools.”
In an emailed statement Monday, HBS spokesperson Brian Kenny wrote that the school made the decision to temporarily shift to remote learning “with the support of Harvard University leaders, advised by city and state public health officials.”
He added that contact tracers have determined that the virus is not spreading in classrooms or among masked individuals.
In Thursday’s email, the HBS administrators blamed the rising cases on “numerous unmasked, indoor activities — everything from sharing an Airbnb for the weekend, to dinner gatherings in an apartment, to larger parties.”
Case numbers first began to rise in one section of required curriculum MBA students. While cases among that section have since dropped, HBS soon after saw another spike emerge in a second section, according to the email.
“We sincerely believe that every student group is one event away from an outbreak cluster like those we’ve begun to see,” the school leaders wrote Thursday.
The next day, Dana Pratt, director for community standards and administration, shared in an email to members of Section G that it had “multiple active COVID cases.”
“Because of your current cases count, we need your section to be extremely vigilant — always wearing masks indoors — and test every other day for the next week,” she warned.
In the spring semester, when HBS was one of Harvard’s only schools conducting limited in-person instruction, it also experienced a surge in cases, moving into the state’s “red zone” with 18 cases in a week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-led Scientific Task Force to Prevent Pandemics at the Source presented their findings Monday at a virtual event featuring renowned primatologist Jane Goodall.
The event — co-hosted by Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation Per Olsson Fridh and the Coalition to Prevent Pandemics at the Source — was held in conjunction with this month’s meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
Experts in global health, climate, and policy discussed how to implement the recommendations made last month by the Scientific Task Force to Prevent Pandemics at the Source, such as preventing pathogen spillover from animals to people.
Aaron Bernstein — the interim director of Harvard School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment and a Harvard Medical School Pediatrics assistant professor — convened the task force in May in hopes of shifting the focus from pandemic preparedness to prevention.
At the event, he highlighted three key findings from the task force’s report: that preventing pandemics is possible, that we must prevent pandemics at the source, and that costs are reduced when pandemics are prevented at the source.
Bernstein said the first step in preventing the next pandemic is preventing pathogen spillover.
“Those viruses have all come from wild animals into people,” Bernstein said. “We have to focus on protecting their habitats, protecting their ecosystems, so that we don’t create interfaces that allow for their pathogens to spread into people.”
Goodall, a primatologist and anthropologist known for her studies observing chimpanzees, said scientists have been warning of pandemics long before the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Scientists studying these zoonotic diseases have been warning us of the inevitability of pandemics, such as Covid-19, for years,” she said. “Alas, we did not listen. Now we pay the price.”
Bernstein also explained how focusing only on preparedness reinforces inequities, as richer countries tend to receive more vaccines and drugs than poorer countries, which are often the most vulnerable.
He added that the climate crisis is closely linked to pandemic prevention and response.
“Preparedness may help us lessen the blow for the next emerging infection, but it will do nothing to halt the tumult in the living world with the climate crisis, each of which contributes to the very risk of emerging infections that we’re trying to address,” he said.
Bernstein’s presentation was followed by a panel discussion that highlighted the urgency and feasibility of developing pandemic prevention policies and allocating funds for initiatives that could help prevent spillover.
Helen E. Clark, the former prime minister of New Zealand, said in order for prevention to be prioritized in the political agenda, the world needs effective leaders who will “listen to the evidence and act accordingly” and work together to coordinate responses.
Yewande Alimi, a program coordinator at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and another member of Bernstein’s task force, said Covid-19 has revealed the links between human health and animal and environmental health, prompting governments to invest more in wildlife.
Though the panelists discussed numerous strategies for pandemic prevention, Goodall questioned whether change will occur quickly enough.
“There are many blueprints for change — we can move forward in a more ethical and sustainable direction,” Goodall said. “But will we have the will to take action now, before it’s too late?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Latinx cultural organizations and House committees across the College are hosting events on campus including movie nights, dance outings, and food tastings to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.
The celebration of the histories and cultures of Hispanic Americans will run from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15.
Uriel Martinez ’22, chair of Latinx organization Concilio Latino, encouraged Harvard students to use the month to learn about the rich culture within the Latinx diaspora.
“Talk to any Latinx people you may know to just become more aware of different cultures that are around you,” Martinez said.
Fuerza Latina, a pan-Latinx social organization on campus, is hosting events organized around weekly themes throughout the month. Themes this year include the performing arts, music, food, and the visual arts, according to Fuerza president Nayleth E. Lopez-Lopez ’23.
“What we really try to do through all of our events is create a community and have a really strong family here on campus for Latinx students,” Lopez-Lopez said.
Latinas Unidas, Fuerza, and Latinx performing group Teatro plan to host a joint film night Thursday as part of their celebration.
One of the largest events this month was Latinx Convocation, a new ceremony started in 2018. Roughly 200 attendees attended this year’s ceremony on Sept. 25, according to Martinez.
Some Houses hosted community events to celebrate Latinx students. The Adams House deans hosted a tea event Sunday called “Hispanic HeriTEAge Month,” featuring foods such as alfajores and ceviche.
J. Andrés Ballesteros ’13, a faculty dean aide at Adams House, said he believes it is important to celebrate the month to showcase the richness of different Hispanic cultures through the example of food.
“I think this event is really important in showing, first of all, how cool Latino culture is and how there is so much to offer, but also how diverse it is within itself,” Ballesteros said. “We switch up the menu each time, so each time I learn new things about the cuisine of the hemisphere.”
Jayleen R. Herrera ’23, president of Latinas Unidas, said she hopes Latinx organizations and students can support each other during the month by holding discussions about the significance of their cultures and by focusing on empowerment and collaboration.
“It’s important that we all just unite, feel proud, celebrate our culture, and empower one another,” Herrera said.
Lopez-Lopez said she is grateful that students can celebrate the month in-person after being separated during the virtual year.
“I’m honestly so happy that we can finally meet up and form community with the first-years and sophomores, because I know — especially from sophomores — they got hit hard by last year,” Lopez-Lopez said. “I feel like they weren’t able to fully see how strong the Latin community is here at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several financial experts predicted that the Harvard endowment will post returns of at least 20 percent when it releases figures for fiscal year 2021 in October, forecasting that strong markets will boost the University’s recovery from the pandemic and bring its endowment to its largest sum in history.
“It was in fact a year of historic investment returns, so I’m sure the numbers will come in at least 20 percent,” said New York University finance professor David L. Yermack ’85. “Whether they’re really up to the levels of the other schools and the broad market benchmarks — that's the real question.”
The expectations come as colleges and universities across the country are reporting record returns on their endowments. This month, the University of Pennsylvania reported a 41.1 percent return for its endowment in fiscal year 2021, while Duke University posted returns of 55.9 percent.
Overall, university endowments returned a median 27 percent for fiscal year 2021, the 12-month period ending in June 2021, according to a report from Inside Higher Ed. For universities with endowments larger than $500 million, returns averaged 34 percent.
Yermack, a former Crimson Managing Editor, said a strong stock market and promising returns from other investment asset classes led to high returns for large endowment funds, including those of higher education institutions.
“I think, overall, everybody made money for this period,” Yermack said.
Yermack noted, however, that some higher education institutions with large endowments, including Harvard, tend to disproportionately invest in alternative asset classes such as hedge funds and private equity, adding a layer of uncertainty in predicting returns.
“We have no idea what they’re going to report,” Yermack said. “I’m sure the numbers will be positive, but whether they’ll be as good as the regular markets is anyone’s guess,”
Charles A. Skorina, who heads a financial executive headhunter firm, corroborated Yermack’s prediction of a 20 percent return, saying he anticipated Harvard’s returns would be higher than in recent years, but not as high as its peer institutions. He said HMC Chief Executive N.P. “Narv” Narvekar tends to pursue a “balanced” investment strategy and does not “swing for the fences.”
Harvard’s endowment returned 6.5 percent and 7.3 percent in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, said a big difference between 2020 — when markets had an off year — and this year was the gradual recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We’re all just breathing a little bit easier because at the end of last year in the midst of Covid, there was some real concern that this might be the start of a long-term decline,” Parker said.
Parker cautioned, however, that while reported returns have been promising, market stability is still uncertain, especially with the rise of the Delta variant.
“In this semi-recovery from the Covid downturn, we really do have a rising tide which is floating all boats,” Parker said. “On the other hand, it’s a strange rising tide because the tide is rising, and then we have a whole bunch of astrologers sitting around saying, ‘The whole tide may recede and we may be back to the bare mud banks here pretty soon because things are too frothy — they’re too good.’”
“It’s just such a tricky time to try to talk about what any of this past year’s performance really means,” he added.
Harvard Management Company spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on expectations for the Harvard endowment’s performance, writing that the HMC’s annual report will be available next month.
Despite his forecasts, Skorina advised in an email that October’s report could still swing in unexpected directions.
“Predictions have a way of pooping on the predictor, which is why I don’t usually make predictions,” Skorina wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council held its first public meeting of the academic year Monday to outline its priorities for the upcoming semester, which include collaborating with Harvard’s graduate student union, strengthening communication between the Council and different University agencies, and finding ways to better support alumni.
The Council, which conducted business virtually last academic year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, held its first meeting in person and broadcast over Zoom. Per Council tradition, the meeting began with a walking tour of the host graduate school, which on Monday was the Graduate School of Design.
While some representatives convened physically in the Graduate School of Design’s Drucker Gallery, those who opted to attend virtually were projected at the front of the room to accommodate the “weird new reality,” as Council President and Medical School student Peter Choi said.
Matthew R. Volpe, a Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers liaison for the Council, said during the meeting that he hopes HGC and the union will collaborate in the following months. He noted that as a student group that receives funding from the University, HGC can serve as a helpful resource to the union.
“There are a lot of things that HGSU can do because we are an independent organization — we are not a student group that gets funding from the University. Members pay dues for our operations,” Volpe said. “But there are also a lot of things that HGC and other types of student groups can do that we can’t do because we aren’t a Harvard student organization.”
Volpe also urged graduate students to alert their peers of the strike authorization vote — which opened Sept. 13 and remains open. Two-thirds of the union members must vote yes to give the union’s Bargaining Committee authorization to call for a strike.
HGC Chair of Advocacy Xavier I. Sayeed outlined additional Council advocacy initiatives for the academic year, which include creating advocacy-oriented Council task forces, pressuring the University to create alumni emails, and mulling shopping week — a course preview tradition under review by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that graduate student workers have said causes job insecurity.
Choi elaborated on the ongoing progress with securing fully operational alumni emails for Harvard graduates, an initiative that began months ago. In response to the University’s decision to discontinue alumni email addresses last year, the Council drafted a memorandum in favor of fully functioning alumni email addresses, citing an inauspicious job market caused by the pandemic.
Choi said that the University plans to assemble a task force to consider alumni email addresses and other ways to support their alumni.
“The Harvard University administration has agreed to get rid of the alumni.harvard.edu emails because it was a forwarding system and not an inbox storage system — it’s a very outdated thing that our peer institutions don’t use,” Choi said. “Right now what Harvard’s trying to do is figure out exactly how to handle the situation.”
Despite the technological challenges of coordinating a hybrid meeting with Council members both in person and on Zoom, some representatives — including Chair of Information Nima S. Zamanpour — were able to make light of the situation.
“Welcome to dystopia,” Zamanpour said with a laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A man drove into the Charles River near Mather House Monday evening after losing control of his vehicle.
The man was the sole occupant of the car and was able to escape the sinking vehicle after the Northeastern University crew team assisted him, according to Cambridge Police spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick.
The crash occurred on Memorial Drive near the intersection with Flagg Street. The car was fully submerged when the Massachusetts State Police arrived on the scene, MSP spokesperson David Procopio wrote in an email.
The man was taken to the hospital “for evaluation of possible minor injuries,” according to Procopio.
Procopio wrote it was unclear what caused the car to go into the river Monday, but Warnick wrote that it “appeared to be the result of a medical episode/incident.”
An hour after the incident, more than 20 police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical personnel remained on the scene as crowds of onlookers gazed from behind barricade tape and across Memorial Drive.
Back Bay resident Mark McDermott said he witnessed the accident during a jog.
“The vehicle — I think it was an SUV-looking thing — bumped over the curb and went flying into the river, narrowly missing a woman and her child,” McDermott said.
“The vehicle stayed afloat for a while,” he continued. “And then the window goes down, and I see a hand wave.”
McDermott said a passing motor boat from the crew team approached the car, threw the man a life jacket, and pulled him out.
“It seemed like as soon as he got out of the water, the thing just sank — kind of a nick-of-time rescue,” he said.
The boat that rescued the driver brought him to shore near John W. Weeks Memorial Bridge, according to McDermott.
Officials were working to remove the car late Monday evening. The Massachusetts State Police’s Marine Unit was on the scene with chainsaws, and scuba divers and a tow truck attempted to recover the vehicle.
Warnick wrote in an email that Massachusetts State Police took jurisdiction over the accident, as the Charles River is state jurisdiction.
In August, another man drove off Memorial Drive into the river just up the street, at the intersection with Western Avenue, after a truck hit his vehicle. The sole occupant of the submerged station wagon was also rescued by the safety boat of a local college crew team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square convenience store Tommy’s Value reopened earlier this month after closing at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic due to a sharp drop in customers, who are predominately Harvard students.
The family-run store, located at 47 Mount Auburn Street, shuttered in March 2020, when Harvard sent students home. The store’s owner, Najeeb Hussain, said in an interview Monday that he lost approximately $60,000 in groceries that he had to throw out upon closing.
“It was difficult for me to keep this going,” he said. “It was very difficult to pay the wages, because I was not making — nothing, basically. The electric bill was accumulating, everything was accumulating, so I just shut it down.”
Hussain said students’ return to campus this fall made it financially prudent to reopen.
“They’re coming back, and they’re helping me and spreading the word,” he said.
Despite the return of students to campus, Hussain said that sales over the past month are only one-third of what they were before the Covid-19 pandemic.
“I’m a little bit worried because I have bills coming up — my rent and my electricity bill and the wages for these guys,” he said. “What I’m earning here, I’m putting back into the store. I have to see if I’ll be able to handle all that.”
“Hopefully, by the middle of next month, I should be back to normal,” Hussain added.
Hussain also said that competition with larger retailers, such as CVS, has exacerbated his financial difficulties.
As business turnover afflicted Harvard Square over the past year and a half, students said they were happy to find Tommy’s still open when they returned to campus this fall.
Rex J. Tercek ’22 said he was “elated” when Tommy’s reopened earlier this month. Tercek said he appreciates the family-run convenience store because it stands out for its authenticity in the Square.
“It’s getting harder and harder to find — in the Harvard area — truly unique, and also just homey spots to exist outside of school and outside of the dorm,” he said.
Olivia R. Wallace ’22 said she likes Tommy’s for its convenience and charm. She recalled a meaningful interaction she had with an employee at the store.
“He was helpful — we talked,” Wallace said. “I told him that I was stressed out from studying and I needed a good snack, and he told me that I should get ice cream.”
When Nicholas L. Amador ’22 returned to campus this fall, he described Harvard Square as “a different place from what it was before the pandemic.”
Amador said he was happy to see that Tommy’s — a familiar store — had survived the pandemic.
“The one thing I can say is that it feels basically the same as when I went there before, except now they’ve got a cat,” Amador said. “So I think that’s a pretty big upgrade.”

I’d like to dedicate this article to all my fellow Quad inhabitants, along with anyone who has a class in the SEAS building, and all those who generally are opposed to walking anywhere. You might be wondering, what common factor unites these groups? Well, there are two — being the main character and spending time on the shuttle.
Now, I must confess that I am not the shuttle’s biggest fan. I have been known to power walk with a bagel and coffee in hand rather than brave the shuttle and its unknown-to-me destinations. I also have been known to download PassioGo and pretend as if I know how to use it. However, the Quad life has necessitated me reluctantly giving in to the shuttle life, and I must say, it comes with one great bonus: living out all of your greatest main character fantasies.
Allow me to provide a scenario. You’re rushing out of your first floor dorm room in Currier, which requires you to run down a flight of stairs and then back up another flight of stairs (and no, this can’t be avoided, for any non-Currierites who might be thinking that I am clearlyyyyy missing something). You have a slightly warm bagel with cream cheese in one hand and a combination of coffee, a hair clip, and earbuds in the other. (Oh, how the female hands have evolved to accommodate a lack of adequate pockets.)
Anyway, you finally get outside of the building, and the last shuttle is driving away with only 15 minutes left before your morning class starts. “Dang, horrible morning!” You might be thinking. WRONG! Could that not be the start to every great pre-2000’s coming-of-age/rom-com/cheesy/heartfelt classic movie?? Maybe you’ll chase after the shuttle, get cream cheese on your favorite pants, and spill coffee everywhere, making the start of a great story that will help you flirt with your super cute TF. Maybe you’ll turn around and your future husband or wife will be standing right there because they just missed the shuttle too! Probably not, but you get the idea. Romanticize the pain away, baby.
For all my pragmatists out there, let me give you a much more realistic scenario — a.k.a., let me use this platform to describe my typical morning to you. You wake up 45 minutes before your class starts, put on some jeans, pack your bag, grab some coffee, and make it to the shuttle on time. You put your earbuds in when you sit down and debate what to listen to. You’re sick of all your normal music, so you decide that you should look for a new playlist. (Prepare yourself to cringe at the next sentence.) After debating for a moment, you type in “main character energy” into Spotify to see what comes up. I KNOW, I know, it’s super weird, and if you feel superior to me right now, I get it.
But, if you just so happen to feel a similar inclination, I highly recommend it. There are some extremely intelligent people out there making Spotify playlists, and let me tell you, I rediscovered some songs that absolutely hit the spot. There’s simply nothing better than listening to some main character music and staring out the window as you pass Cambridge Commons, knowing that you’re protected inside the shuttle and can’t smell the super extreme odor that has been coming from that general area in recent weeks (hopefully other people have noticed this??).
Anyway, the point is that if you want to walk into your 9 a.m. feeling the full potential of your gaslight-girlboss side, I 10/10 recommend having a main character shuttle moment. It’s probably equally powerful to a hot girl walk and completely eliminates the need for the walk aspect — woohoo! So, go catch that shuttle, go look out that window like you’re in a cheesy Jonas Brothers type music video, and go shamelessly look for that main character music that will help you semi-seize the day.
