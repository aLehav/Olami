After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Oftentimes, music is perceived foremost as an exploration of harmony — how different sounds work mutually, usually conjunctly, and always carefully to create a pleasing, uncontroversial sound. Yet music is as much, if not more so, about its contrast as it is about its homogeneity: It explores the sonic relations between consonance and dissonance, between order and chaos, between sparseness and abundance. Indeed, “Time Release,” the Boston Modern Orchestra Project’s (BMOP) first concert in their orchestral series, not only highlighted these dualities, but went further by juxtaposing the notion of musical contrast itself against homophonic unity.
The concert, which took place at the New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall on Oct. 19, featured four pieces by three very contemporary composers. Consisting of Howard Meltzer’s “Vision Machine,” Hannah Lash’s “Concerto No. 2 for Harp and Orchestra,” and Steven Mackey’s “Time Release” and “Tonic,” that night’s repertoire was all written in the past 15 years. And yet, between the works’ modern harmonic and orchestrational innovations are musical elements steeped in tradition: Fugal textures, neo-Romantic melodic developments, and Stravinsky-esque timbral humor are weaved organically through the music, exemplifying yet another duality that the performance sought to explore.
Based on French architect Jean Nouvel’s creation with the same name, Meltzer’s “Vision Machine” reflects several multi-faceted dualities and expresses them in a quasi-kaleidoscopic way. This manifests immediately from the first few chords. Pillars of consonance move smoothly and unassumingly through dissonant waters, unfolding into a vivid, colorful tapestry. This sonic balance and delicacy, crafted on stage by the orchestra’s conductor, Gil Rose, is reflected further as the full-bodied, bold staccati of the brass transition seamlessly into ethereal, artificial harmonics in the strings. Indeed, as the piece develops, the once-stable homophony becomes increasingly unsettling while ease and comfort underlie the typically-chaotic aleatoric sections. This conflation of orchestrational purposes — namely between structured, tangible forms and their unstable, near-immaterial counterparts — serves as a powerful musical allegory not only between the intangible “vision” and the real-bodied “machine,” but also between the abstractness of music and the permanence of architecture.
Meanwhile, Lash’s piece projects duality from a different lens. She pays particular attention to the relationship between soloist and orchestra — supposedly equal counterparts, in classic Baroque tradition. The harp part — performed by the composer herself — was immediately set apart from the rest of the orchestra, both timbrally and emotionally. Yet, it slowly coalesces: The orchestra’s still, sustained tones and the harp’s nostalgic, transient arpeggios merge poignantly into an exquisite oboe melody in the first movement. This unity crumbles as soon as it appears. By the second movement, a mellow, waltz-like texture is increasingly interrupted by a raucous orchestra until it disappears altogether.
It was the Mackey works, however, that embodied the notion of duality to the fullest. “Time Release,” a percussion concerto written for the night’s soloist, Colin Currie, opens immediately with rhythmic and orchestrational juxtaposition: Low, ominous string notes alternate and intertwine with eclectic but continually groovy percussion solos on cymbals and bongo drums. Tension developed through extended marimba cadenzas, taking on a rustic yet idiomatic character, eventually morph into a triumphant chorale in the brass, before returning to the dark tone of the movement’s opening. In this way, “Time Release” introduces the beautifully crafted musical ebb-and-flow that Mackey imbues in the rest of his work. For example, though the opening of the second movement features exceptionally sharp, striking transitions between large chord expanses and piercing brass notes, it mellows into a distinctive tune in the marimba supported by an orchestra that, for perhaps the first time in the piece, is fully united. The third movement, separated explicitly into two parts, literally demonstrates this duality: A self-described “smooth/bumpy” ride evolves into a majestic “Alleluia” that allows Currie’s stunning playing to soar above the orchestra.
“Tonic,” the final work on the program, takes a slightly different approach. It struggles its way from a series of dense, transient dissonances to the discovery of a true tonic key, in a journey that is at once trying and cathartic.
It is this catharsis — this development of tension that culminates in a controlled yet worthwhile release — that makes the thorough exploration of musical juxtaposition so invigorating. Through careful, artisanal treatment of multiple dimensions of contrast, the concert’s composers and musicians showed how vastly different musical entities can, ultimately, be brought together.
BMOP’s next concert is Thursday, Nov. 30 at Jordan Hall, featuring works by Vijay Iyer, Lukas Foss, Matthew Aucoin and Carlos Surinach.

This week, from Nov. 8 to Nov. 10, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club will present their fall production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic opera “Patience; or, Bunthorne’s Bride.” “Patience,” a biting satire of overly aestheticized art and artists in late-19th century England, tells the story of two buffoonish poets Bunthorne (Janiah C. Lockett ’20) and Grosvenor (Ross Simmons ’21) in their bumbling attempts to win the affections of the plain milkmaid Patience (Sydney K. Penny ’22).
With nine performances in a little over a week, along with half a semester’s worth of preparation, taking on the lead was no small commitment for Penny. “It’s definitely a lot to juggle,” Penny said. Fortunately, Penny has prior experience. “Doing an operetta is a very different style of singing than what you would think of as a typical musical,” Penny said. “I started classically training my sophomore year in high school.”
Lockett plays Bunthorne, a self-professed aesthete and a pretentious, fake poet. Lockett, an English concentrator, noted some ironic parallels between the 19th century aesthetic movement in England and her experiences studying at Harvard.“If we’re going to bring this into Harvard terms, Grosvenor is the section kid, and I’m the person who didn’t do the reading but can pretend like I did it really well,” she said.
Jarod Stone ’21, who is the music director for “Patience” and an experienced conductor, was particularly excited about the pieces in the operetta. “Where Sullivan’s genius really comes out is where he uses the music to augment the satire,” Stone said. “It’s just such melodrama.”
Director Abraham Joyner-Meyers ’21 has been working on “Patience” since the spring semester, preparing his directorial vision and managing auditions, casting, and rehearsals. While the show is only just beginning, Joyner-Meyers is feeling relaxed. “Most of my work ends on Friday [Nov. 2],” he said. He’ll watch the upcoming productions, take notes and make changes if necessary. “I’ve been joking that in some ways that’s my payment,” he added.
“Patience” will run this coming week at the Agassiz Theater: Nov. 8, Nov. 9, Nov. 10 at 8 p.m., and Nov. 10, Nov. 11 at 2 p.m.

Last week, the Library Innovation Lab at Harvard Law School published a digital database of case law documents dating from 1658 to 2018. This initiative, the Caselaw Access Project, has worked for years to digitize all the documents, which consist of more than 40 million pages. We commend the Law School for making this massive trove of legal information available to the Harvard community and the public at large.
Such a project is important for increasing legal transparency. As the project’s director, Adam Ziegler, noted, the entire project’s purpose was to address the “real need for ready access to court opinions.” Indeed, the finished project accomplishes that goal, providing access that stretches far in time and scope. Over three hundred and fifty years’ worth of case law documents from many areas of the U.S. judicial system — on the federal, state, and territorial levels — are now available.
Perhaps even more importantly, the way that the project has released these documents to the public makes access to academic resources more equitable. Harvard affiliates have unlimited access, and non-Harvard affiliates can view the basic information of all cases and five hundred full case texts per day.
This public availability is important because the legal history of our country should be open to all. Furthermore, everyone is affected by the ramifications of judicial decisions, and everyone has the right to see what goes on at all levels of our judicial system, whether to satiate curiosity or to pursue academic inquiries.
We hope that researchers will use these court opinions to further advance academic scholarship in this area. In particular, we hope that computer programmers are able to take full advantage of this repository of information. As Ziegler noted, no lawyer will be able to take full advantage of the millions of pages in the database, but computers have an advantage in this regard. Like Ziegler, we are hopeful that researchers using the database will be able to learn more about less understood aspects of the legal system — such as how courts influence each other and deal with disagreements. Those big-picture questions could not have been answered as well without the information provided by this new database.
This project is a resounding success for the Harvard Library, which happens also to be looking for a new leader. We hope that the person hired for the job will be similarly committed to projects that increase access to information — a key value that all who work in higher education should hold near and dear. In addition to maintaining the vast amounts of histories and stories already in the system, Harvard’s libraries should seek to illuminate content that may have been erased or obscured. There is always more to learn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among all the justified questioning of college legacy admissions, one question remains for me: Why are legacies called that? “Legacy” is a high-minded word for a concept that can seem to fall short — all it means is that a student’s parent happened to go to the same educational institution that the student ends up at.
Proponents of legacy status, like Harvard, would certainly have us believe that it is a grand, intangible asset. In a filing for the lawsuit against Students for Fair Admissions, University lawyers defended consideration of legacy status because it “cements strong bonds between the College and its alumni and encourages alumni to remain engaged with the University for the rest of their lives.”
I find this reasoning fair enough — in theory. Of course an institution should want its alumni to retain “strong bonds” and stay “engaged,” in order to create a thriving community of graduates with similar experiences and to help the school improve over the years. To that end, I think it’s within Harvard’s bounds to want legacies.
In practice, though, I think legacy admissions fail these goals. This “encourag[ing]” of alumni essentially amounts to the arranging of quid pro quo transactions. The level of “remain[ing] engaged” for alumni is measured in dollar signs. For all the talk about the importance of legacies in grand abstract terms, it all comes down to crass transactions — money for seats.
I don’t dispute the usefulness of big donations. As The Crimson’s editorial board, of which I am a member, has suggested, perhaps the money from alumni is “designed to help keep Harvard financially afloat.” In particular, donations may provide for a sizeable portion of financial aid, thus ensuring that many students who otherwise could not afford to attend the institution can in fact benefit from the education it provides.
I also don’t dispute the genuine desire to give money to one’s alma mater. I went to the kind of high school that would probably take into account legacy status, and it already targets me in alumni contribution campaigns. They impress upon us the importance of giving anything, even if it’s five dollars, considering our limited financial situations as college students. And I do give, because, however hokey it may sound, I do think of my school as a community that I want to remain engaged with for the rest of my life. More generally, if one has the money, one should do what one wants with it — especially using it for causes dear to one’s heart.
But I do take issue with the apparent quid pro quo nature of legacy admissions. While testifying in the lawsuit in Harvard’s defense, Ruth J. Simmons, the former president of Brown University, admitted her belief that fewer people would donate to Harvard if the school eliminated legacy preferences. Harvard and its alumni alike deserve the blame for leading reasonable people to reach that sad conclusion.
There is a difference between donating to your alma mater and wanting your kid to get in, and donating to help your kid get in — especially if you believe that you yourself got into the school on your own merits. No one else may ever know the real reason why you do what you do in these cases. But the difference exists.
Because legacy status means more if it is earned. Though I’m not a Harvard legacy, I’ll admit that it would mean something if future generations of my family got to go to Harvard. But that legacy would really only mean something to me if my children could get on their own merits — if I as a parent could raise them in the way my parents raised me. Maybe I’m just saying this now, but I hope I’ll still believe it later.
So here’s my two cents: Legacy status is a big deal. Institutions should aim to be so good that alumni want to send their kids to them and remain engaged for their whole lives, helping out in whatever way they can. The creation of legacies, to schools and students alike, will even mean enough to deserve such a grand label. But too often, legacy status is not treated with that reverence. Legacy is worth building, not buying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a group of students hosted Harvard Sex Week, a series of widely-publicized events with titles ranging from “Hit Me Baby One More Time: BDSM in the Dorm Room” and “Bloody Good! An Intro to Period Sex” to “One is Not Enough: Open Relationships, Non-Monogamy, & Polyamory.” The Undergraduate Council and the Harvard Foundation shared the distinction of sponsoring these talks with, among others, various retailers of exotic sex toys, lubricants, and condoms.
Over our years at Harvard, we’ve seen our fair share of the extreme and the avant-garde, but this year’s programming managed to shock even us. The idea that a week including BDSM and polyamory could possibly contribute anything to a healthy understanding of sex struck us as entirely backward. Why has our dialogue about sex, something which should be considered intimate and reverent and profound, become simply an outlet for our unrestrained desires and debased passions?
The answer, we suspect, likely has something to do with the fact that Harvard teaches us from our very first week on campus an oversimplified attitude towards sex that we might call the “consensual” philosophy of sex. Each year during Opening Days, freshmen sit through a mandatory theatrical production called “Speak About It” in which, over an hour of sexual reenactments, they learn that as long as they have “consent,” they are free to engage in whatever with whomever they please. What matters is not the act consented to, but the consent itself. While consent is obviously essential to the very nature of sex, there is so much more to it than just a verbal assent extracted from the other party in order to do whatever one desires.
Because there are no other normative guidelines on what true and good sex is, this ambivalence inevitably reduces sex, one of the most powerful and meaningful components of the human experience, to what many young people invariably want it to be: a purely physical act whose primary function is to produce pleasure and satisfy passions. It matters not with whom one engages in it, neither the duration or depth of that relationship, nor yet the further continuance of the relationship. To speak of its emotional and spiritual aspects feels awkward and anachronistic, and discussion of its procreative nature, arguably the most essential characteristic of sex, is avoided like the plague.
But the consequences of this cheapened, hollowed-out view of sex are heartbreaking. They can be seen in a culture of one-night-stands and hook-ups, fueled by alcohol, often ending in indifference and, occasionally, emotional trauma. Young men and women learn to see one another as means to gratification and not ends in themselves, infinitely valuable and unique. A woman who had suffered the emotional toll of being ghosted once too many times asked in a New York Times column whether by consenting to hook-up culture, she had also consented to its premise of detachment and self-centeredness. When we lower our standards of acceptable sexual behavior to merely what is legal, we should not be surprised to see our personal standards of sexual morality drop and unbridled license expand to fill the void.
A sexual ethic that bases its standards solely on what is allowed teaches students that they are being moral by merely staying within the bounds of the law. A robust ethic has positive rather than solely negative norms. Students learn implicitly a definition of sex as allowance, where anything not prohibited is good, instead of realizing that boundaries and reason help make sex the entirely unique and wonderful thing it is. Paradoxically, this prohibitive ethic in which we are currently immersed destroys the possibility of allowing people to see sex as a good and honorable and beautiful thing.
One of the self-proclaimed objectives of Sex Week was to “connect diverse individuals and communities both within and beyond Harvard,” and the group that runs it aims to “open up campus dialogue.” This is an aspiration we can certainly agree with, and we want to begin engaging in this dialogue by rejecting the premise that the ethic of “consent” is sufficient to create a culture of sex that truly empowers and connects.
Couldn’t we all agree that true sex requires genuine care for the other party and to have their best interest at heart? The moment we impose this reasonable requirement, we recategorize a wide swath of sexual behavior — drunken one-night-stands for instance — as instead a sort of glorified mutual masturbation. As we continue to positively construct sex by considering its many natural and valuable facets, we begin to elevate its dignity and purpose and reestablish a philosophy of sexual ethics that we believe benefits everyone. At the Harvard College Anscombe Society, we believe among other things that true sex should be a total and unreserved giving of oneself to another, physically, emotionally, psychologically, biologically, and spiritually. Its primary function is unitive, tying two people in an indissoluble bond, and procreative, wherein the love shared between the two manifests itself in the miracle of human life.
Only when we take every aspect of sex seriously and consider it in its proper framing, can we recover its natural beauty and value. Admittedly, constructing a full alternative vision of sex is not something that can be easily done in an op-ed, and the Anscombe Society — through meetings and public talks, including one with world-renowned moral philosopher Dr. Janet E. Smith this week — hopes to continue this ongoing dialogue about true love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Alumni Association sent an email to College seniors and alumni asking them to promote their Harvard experiences on social media this week, a move some experts say may help bolster the University's image following the high-stakes and high-profile admissions trial.
The program — dubbed “Crimson Connect” — formally launched Monday morning, three days after the trial concluded. A frequently asked questions page linked in a message sent to alumni details how, by posting suggested content, “generating traffic,” and recruiting other “Crimson Connectors,” Harvard affiliates can rack up points and earn the chance to collect school gear.
Alumni Affairs and Development administrator Tammie L. Ruda ’90 wrote in a statement Tuesday night that the project grew out of work that began in 2017 and that initiative's debut is not connected to the trial’s conclusion.
“We are always learning and looking for feedback on successful ways of engaging and staying [in] touch with our alumni community,” she wrote.
Participants in the program have two options for what to post: they can write their own language — which Harvard will credit if posters use certain keywords — or repost content periodically distributed by the University.
In the email, Alumni Association Executive Director Philip W. Lovejoy and Ruda wrote that the program is meant to help alums interact with one another.
“Alumni want to hear from each other and this is [a] great way to share stories that resonate with your classmates,” they wrote.
The announcement of the program comes at a time when Harvard faces the national spotlight after University lawyers wrapped up three weeks in federal court defending the College against charges of race-based discrimination in its admissions process.
Robert Wynne, president of Wynne Communications has helped universities like MIT and Johns Hopkins craft their public relations strategy. Wynne wrote in an email that — even if the email’s timing was coincidental — the program is a productive response to the admissions lawsuit.
“Universities do this once they perceive a crisis has happened,” he wrote.
At stake in the high-profile trial is whether or not Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies have led the school to illegally discriminate against Asian-American applicants, as the plaintiff — anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions — alleged when it sued the University in 2014. Harvard has repeatedly denied SFFA's allegations.
The judge in the case is not slated to make a final ruling for several months. No matter what she rules, the disappointed party is likely to appeal, and experts have predicted the case will reach the Supreme Court. If it comes before the newly conservative court, the suit could spell the end of affirmative action in the United States.
Wynne wrote that the strategy of asking alumni to serve as brand ambassadors is “usually reactive, rather than proactive.”
“It's more powerful for alumni to spread the message as opposed to administrators or using a PR firm to respond,” he wrote.
Public relations specialist Joseph A. Brennan — who also works on strategic communications within higher education — said the timing of the announcement is “interesting.”
“I wouldn’t want to read into a motivation on that, but it could lead some people to speculate that this is an effort to shore up a brand or to reverse some negativity,” he said.
Brennan agreed with Wynne that this strategy can be effective. He said “third party voices” such as alumni can tell authentic stories about their Harvard experience online and reach a network of other affiliates.
“It’s a smart strategy to try to mobilize third party voices to speak in support about your brand,” Brennan said. “People tend to associate with those who share something in common.”

Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services, confirmed “recent cases of mumps and infectious mononucleosis” on campus this semester in an email to College students Tuesday.
This is not the first time this year University affiliates have contracted the disease. Cases of mumps were found most recently among campus affiliates in Feb. 2018 — almost two years after the first major outbreak in recent memory back in spring 2016. HUHS recorded more than 60 confirmed cases during the 2016 outbreak, and the Cambridge Public Health Department quarantined infected students for five days.
Barreira recommended that students take several precautions ahead of the Harvard-Yale football game, slated to be played on Nov. 17.
He advised students to wash their hands often with soap and water, refrain from sharing smoking materials and glasses, and avoid touching their eyes, noses, and mouths. Barreira also gave a few guidelines for students who plan to host parties, recommending that they offer paper cups for drinks, limit crowds, and encourage guests who are ill to leave and contact HUHS.
“Prevention of mumps and mono is centered on good hygiene and reducing the spread by saliva,” Barreira wrote in the email.
People infected with mumps may experience a host of symptoms including facial swelling, jaw pain, ear ache, and testicular swelling. Though the vaccine given to mumps patients is 88 percent effective, mumps outbreaks can still occur among “highly-vaccinated” individuals, particularly when they come into close contact with one another, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Even with good hygiene and preventive practices, mumps has the potential to spread through the air as well as through human-to-human contact, per the World Health Organization.
In 2016, Barreira said 99 percent of undergraduates had been vaccinated against the disease, citing mandatory student vaccine documentation.
By contrast, mono is a relatively common illness on college campuses. The disease can cause fever, sore throat, swollen glands, and fatigue.
Barreira concluded his email by urging students to refrain from public activities and to contact HUHS if they begin to experience the symptoms of mumps or mono.
“We all have a responsibility to help prevent the spread of these viruses,” Barreria wrote.

Harvard's Faculty Council voted unanimously to dismiss a College student for sexual misconduct, Claudine Gay, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, announced at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
The Council, the highest governing body in FAS, heard the student’s case at its Oct. 10 meeting. They received the case for review after the student was found guilty of violating the FAS sexual and gender-based harassment policy. The student has already been informed of the Council’s decision, Gay said.
Cases involving sexual or gender-based harassment are investigated by the University’s Office of Dispute Resolution. The investigative office then issues a report on its findings and sends a copy to the College’s Administrative Board, which determines what disciplinary action, if any, is appropriate.
In the "most serious" cases, the Ad Board — composed of faculty members and administrators — can recommend that the Faculty Council dismiss a student from the College. The only way a student can then be readmitted is if the Council votes again to allow the student to re-enroll.
Following Gay’s announcement, the Faculty voted on the first item of their agenda, approving changes to the foreign language requirement for undergraduates. The revised wording eliminates the previous requirement that the language have a “written component.” Students will now be able to fulfill their requirement using languages like American Sign Language.
The new changes also specify that if a student wants to place out of the requirement using a language that Harvard does not currently offer, the Office of Undergraduate Education will attempt to find a qualified examiner from another institution. Previously, students had to find a Harvard faculty member to administer the exam.
The Faculty also considered loosening part of the foreign language requirement to allow students to retake language placement exams. Ultimately, with the Faculty divided on the issue, they chose to stick with the status quo: students cannot retake language placement exams.
Elvira G. Di Fabio, senior preceptor in Romance Languages and Literatures, addressed the Faculty for several minutes about the importance of studying language at Harvard.
“Allowing students to retake the placement exam for a second time for the purpose of meeting the language requirement would on principle weaken and undermine the College’s commitment to the study of languages and cultures in their own languages,” Di Fabio said.
English Professor James T. Engell ’73 and History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 also spoke in favor of prohibiting students from retaking their placement exams.
“Precisely because English has achieved a sort of linguistic imperium, unless we wish our educated graduates to represent our university as self-satisfied language hegemons we should be asking them more urgently than ever to enter into at least one of the cultural worlds that a foreign language represents,” Maier said.
Jay M. Harris, former dean of undergraduate education, also proposed an amendment specifying that students can take placement exams in “all forms of a language that are customary in the practice of that language today.” The Faculty voted unanimously to approve Harris’s proposal.
FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke also spoke to the Faculty about a proposed schedule change that would give instructors the choice to delay the start times of their two-hour classes to 12:45 p.m. and 3:45 p.m. in order to allow more time for students to eat lunch. Burke noted that since this is a substantive change to the handbook, the proposal was brought up for discussion only and the Faculty will vote on it at their next monthly meeting.
Jeffrey T. Schnapp, professor of Romance Languages and Literatures and of Comparative Literature, also introduced Curricle, an online interactive syllabus tool, at the meeting. Schnapp presented slides on how the new tool is used and demonstrated a beta user interface for the tool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, Jewish studies Professor Jay M. Harris spoke about the history and character of anti-Semitism in the United States at Harvard Hillel Tuesday evening.
The Oct. 27 shooting at Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history, left many on campus grieving for the 11 killed and six wounded. Witnesses said the shooter yelled anti-Semitic statements before he opened fire.
Paulette K. Schuster ’20, who helped organize the Hillel event, said she invited Harris in response to students’ desires for experts to “contextualize” anti-Semitism in America after the “rattling” attack.
“It really was a scary reminder that Jews aren’t as integrated as they hoped they are,” she said.
Harris’s hour-long talk began with a history of discrimination against Jews in the United States and the origins of the term “anti-Semitism.” He also spoke about the differences between Jews’ experiences in the U.S. and in Europe; though Jews have never been denied citizenship in the U.S. as they have been overseas, Harris said Jews historically faced exclusion from many social institutions in America.
After introducing the historical context, Harris went on to discuss what many consider to be burgeoning anti-Semitism among both liberals and conservatives in the U.S.
“What is distinct in particular about Jews is that Jews are often targets of deep hatred coming from the left, as they are the targets of deep hatred coming from the right,” Harris said. “The hatred directed towards Jews coming from both sides of the political spectrum is an oddity relative to most other forms of bigotry.”
Corey A. Gold ’19, Hillel’s undergraduate president, said Hillel planned the event for both Jews and non-Jews at Harvard to hear about the reality of anti-Semitism in the U.S. today.
“In the past couple years we’ve seen an uptick in the number of anti-Semitic incidents reported, and I think for the first time — for many young American Jews around our age — it’s the first time they’ve really encountered it in such a visceral and painful way,” Gold said.
Harris also discussed why he believes anti-Semitism often goes unrecognized as a form of discrimination today.
He said that because power is often thought of in terms of money and race and because Jews “track on the powerful side” in both of those factors, it can be difficult to conceptualize anti-Semitism.
“Lots of people are not very comfortable acknowledging that you can have... a group of people that are politically powerful — arguably beyond their numbers — and economically powerful — arguably beyond their numbers — who are still vulnerable,” he said.
“We need to help people expand the boundaries of how they think,” Harris added.

In a midterm election framed as a referendum on President Donald Trump, Massachusetts re-elected its popular incumbents — and on the national stage, Democrats regained control of the U.S. House.
Democrats flipped the seats they needed to wrest the House majority from Republicans, while Republicans increased their majority in the U.S. Senate — capping off a high-intensity midterm season with a tempered victory for Democrats.
In Massachusetts, incumbent Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren — who cast her own vote in Cambridge earlier this morning — received overwhelming voter support in her bid for a second term to the U.S. Senate. Warren’s win was called immediately after the polls closed. Her challenger, Republican Geoff G. Diehl, received slightly over one-third of the vote. Diehl led the state's efforts to elect Trump in 2016.
Incumbent Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, a Republican frequently ranked as America’s “most popular” governor, held onto his seat with equal ease. He fended off a challenge from Democrat Jay Gonzalez, who alienated fellow Democrats — including Warren — with a proposed endowment tax that would have cost Harvard over $500 million a year.
Incumbent Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito also easily defeated Democratic challenger Quentin A. Palfrey ’96.
Following Baker’s victory, John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, father of Quentin Palfrey and Adams House faculty dean, said he was confused by the magnitude of Baker’s dominance throughout the race.
“It seemed a little surprising to us that, in this quite blue and progressive state, the voters like to have a Republican governor,” Sean Palfrey said.
The gubernatorial and Senate races in Massachusetts were both called by 8:15 p.m, only minutes after the polls closed.
In addition to re-electing popular incumbents, Mass. voters also used their ballots to show their support for transgender rights. Ballot Question 3 — which upheld a 2016 law banning public discrimination against transgender individuals — received an overwhelming “yes” from Mass. voters.
The results of Ballot Question 2 were equally decisive. Voters showed strong support for the question, which would establish a commission to push for a limit to national corporate political spending. Question 2, like Question 3, received roughly 70 percent of the vote.
Ballot Question 1 — which proposed to limit the nurse to patient ratio — was the first of the questions to be called. Over two-thirds of Massachusetts voters cast a vote against the proposition, allowing hospitals to assign patients to nurses however they see fit.
Down the ballot, Massachusetts voters largely supported their incumbents. Democrat Maura T. Healey ’92 will remain the commonwealth's attorney general after fending off a challenge from Republican James R. McMahon, while Democrat William F. Galvin succeeded in his race for secretary of state against Republican Anthony M. Amore.
Democratic incumbent Katherine M. Clark of Massachusetts's 5th Congressional District — which includes Harvard’s Cambridge campus — was also easily re-elected to her fourth term. She defeated Republican challenger John Hugo by a significant margin.
Meanwhile, Democrat Ayanna S. Pressley, who ran unopposed after defeating long-time incumbent Michael E. Capuano in the September primary, will represent Massachusetts's 7th Congressional District in Washington, D.C. Part of the district includes Harvard’s Allston and Longwood campuses.
Around the country, the results ultimately split control of Congress. Democrats made significant gains in House races in New York, New Jersey, California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. They also picked up a few House seats in Texas and Iowa.
Meanwhile, in the Senate, Republicans picked up seats from Democrats in North Dakota, Missouri, Florida, and Indiana, expanding their majority. Former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also won a Senate seat in Utah.
In Texas, incumbent Senator Ted Cruz managed to narrowly fend off Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke in a closely-watched race that became the most expensive U.S. Senate race in American history.
In the gubernatorial races, the anticipated “blue wave” largely did not make landfall. Florida chose a Republican candidate, Ron DeSantis, over the state's potentially history-making Democratic challenger, Andrew Gillum. Connecticut momentarily flipped from blue to red with the election of Republican Bob Stefanowski — but flipped back from Republicans to Democrats early Wednesday morning.

On a rainy Tuesday in Cambridge, midterm election races across the United States kept undergraduates and faculty members on the edge of their seats — and their eyes glued to screens — throughout the night.
Undergraduates watched the results roll in at three separate watch parties on campus. The Institute of Politics hosted its watch party at the Harvard Kennedy School; the Government Department and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science co-sponsored an event at Currier House; and the Network of Enlightened Women hosted a watch party for conservative students in Boylston Hall.
At the largest gathering, hundreds of Harvard students packed into the IOP to watch CNN’s election coverage on screens displayed throughout the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
At Currier House, around 50 students gathered in the Fishbowl common space to watch the results, and the conservative watch party drew a crowd of students as well.
Maria J. Perez Franco ’20, a resident of Lewisville, Texas, expressed disappointment at the results of her state’s Senate race, which saw incumbent Republican Ted Cruz fend off a challenge from Democrat Beto O’Rourke.
“I’m really sad right now,” she said. “I don’t think I was super hopeful, but part of me was hoping Beto would win.”
Perez Franco, who moved to the U.S. from Guatemala when she was three years old, said she cast an absentee ballot for O’Rourke.
“Everything Ted Cruz has said about the [migrant] caravan has really impacted me as an immigrant, and I’m sad to see that someone who feels that way will continue to hold the seat,” she said. “But this just makes me want to go back to Texas and change things for the better.”
While several left-leaning students reacted positively to the Democratic takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives, conservative students were relieved to see the U.S. Senate remain in Republican hands.
Kiera E. O’Brien ’20, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said she was generally pleased with Tuesday’s results.
“Ultimately, I’m very happy with how the Senate is looking,” she said. “I think a lot of us expected that we would lose the House, but honestly I haven’t seen as much carnage as I would have expected.”
Pablo T. Rasmussen ’20, who is from Oklahoma’s 5th Congressional District — where Democrat Kendra Horn staged an upset victory in a race where the Republic was expected to coast to victory — said he was “glad” to see Democratic victories, especially in his home state.
“We were worried for a minute there about whether the blue wave was real or not — it’s certainly not a tsunami… but we’re no longer completely out of power, so it’s something,” he said.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said he was “really excited” about Democrats regaining control of the House.
“It shows folks around the country wanted to stand up and take a stand against what they’re seeing from the Trump administration,” he said. “People have this misconception that we still have divided government and nothing’s going to happen, but we actually have the leverage to advance priorities like healthcare and immigration.”
Meanwhile, Rasmussen cautioned that despite Democratic victories in the House, divisions still remain across the nation.
“What is most disappointing is that tomorrow we need to wake up as a country and realize the same divisions that brought us disappointing results in 2016 are still there, and Democrats taking the House doesn’t change that,” Rasmussen said. “We still need to address these divisions both in and out of the ballot box.”
Freeland said the midterms were a referendum on President Donald Trump.
“Trump was on the ballot this fall and people voted him out,” he said.
Michelle Hu ’19, a Democrat from Illinois, said she voted for Democrat J.B. Pritzker, who won the governorship after incumbent Republican Governor Bruce Rauner conceded the race just an hour after the polls closed.
Despite Pritzker’s victory, Hu said she was concerned about Democrats’ prospects in other parts of the Midwest. She said Republican wins in those areas mirror Trump’s 2016 victory.
“But I think more young people voting can change that,” she said as she watched results roll in from the Currier House watch party.
At the conservative watch party, over 30 students gathered in Boylston Hall to watch FOX News’s coverage of the election. One student sported a “Make America Great Again” hat.
Katherine A. Krolicki ’20, Network of Enlightened Women president, said the group wanted its own space this year to watch the results come in and encourage a greater sense of “camaraderie” among conservative students.
“A lot of us were here on campus in 2016,” she said. “You could really tell how skewed the campus was, and you kind of felt left out in a lot of senses, so being able to be around people who are on the same side, and kind of understand your feelings throughout this night — it’s a nice way for us to all get together.”
For Harvard Votes Challenge co-founder Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20, who attended the IOP watch party, watching the results unfold was a chance to see the culmination of a semester-long get-out-the-vote initiative.
“I am really proud of all the Harvard students who worked incredibly hard to ensure that their classmates voted,” Landis said. “This was a really exciting election because there’s a lot of energy among young voters, and I’m looking forward to seeing how that played out on a national scale.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the high-profile and high-stakes Harvard admissions trial spilled secret after secret of the College’s notoriously private admissions process across the past three weeks, high schoolers around the country followed along with bated breath.
In online forums like College Confidential and in anxious calls to college admissions consultants, students and their parents dissected every juicy detail — ranging from the fact Harvard favors those who fund it to the fact College admissions officers cannot consider race when assigning personal scores to the fact Asian-American Harvard applicants saw the lowest admit rate of any racial group from 1995 to 2013.
Some of their college counselors, though, were less riveted.
Counselors working both in the private consulting business and on high school campuses said that, though they noticed an uptick in Harvard-related calls and questions from clients during the trial, they themselves do not find the revelations that surfaced in court surprising.
“We're actually pretty well aware of how it works anyway,” said Canh E. Oxelson, executive director of college counseling at the Horace Mann School.
The Harvard admissions trial, which kicked off on Oct. 15, wound to a close Friday after three weeks of fiery debate between Harvard’s lawyers and attorneys for Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group suing the University over its admissions process. The judge presiding over the case, Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court in Boston, is not expected make a ruling for months.
No matter how she rules, one thing is clear: this year’s batch of Harvard hopefuls will benefit from an inside understanding of the College’s admissions process unavailable to generations of prior applicants. Information released as part of the trial — the latest development in SFFA’s 4-year-old lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants — shows how Harvard scores the academic achievements and personal qualities of each high schooler, as well as how it determines which applicants to reject.
Erika G. Chapin, college counseling director for the Hopkins School in New Haven, Conn., said parents and students at her school have closely tracked the case.
“Of course it has been of interest to our students and families,” Chapin said. “I think one of the more interesting thoughts that our families have had, especially for our Asian-American families, is they feel like with this issue part of under a bit of microscope this year, they feel a little more potentially confident about the process.”
Brian Taylor, managing director of college consulting firm Ivy Coach, agreed that some applicants — especially those of Asian heritage — may feel more confident in applying to Harvard while its admissions process is under public scrutiny.
He noted that “way more” students working with his firm are applying to Harvard this year as compared to previous years.
“In past years have we discouraged our Asian-American applicants with their perfect grades and perfect scores from applying to Harvard? Sure,” Taylor said. “And as much as we’ve discouraged them in the past we’re encouraging them this year because they eyes of the Department of Justice are looking.”
The Justice Department has publicly sided against Harvard and with SFFA, filing a scathing “statement of interest” in court in August 2018 that asserted the College perpetrates “unlawful racial discrimination” against Asian-American applicants. The department is independently conducting a Title VI investigation into the University in response to charges that the College rejects qualified Asian Americans in favor of less deserving applicants of other races.
Though a number of college counselors noted heightened interest in the case — and in Harvard — most said information that came to light as part of the trial will not change the advice they give to prospective applicants.
“It isn't changing our counsel on how to work with these families through their application processes,” Chapin said.
Anna Ivey, the founder of Ivey Consulting, also said she thinks the trial will have a limited effect on this year’s application cycle.
“For the short term I don't think this changes a thing for applicants,” Ivey said. “In the short term, applicants can assume that the status quo will still operate. Several years from now, things might look different.”
Like Oxelson, Ivey and others said tibits made public as part of the trial — while interesting — are largely par for the course.
“Everything that's coming out as a result of this lawsuit and the discovery process, it's not surprising to any of us,” she said. “This is all stuff we knew was already happening in many ways, it's not even specific to Harvard. This is common at many private, selective colleges.”
Still, Chapin acknowledged the procedural secrets unveiled over the course of the Harvard trial could reshape the way students and families seek admission to highly selective universities more broadly.
“I think there's understanding that it's not just Harvard, because this is not only Harvard,” Chapin said. “Harvard is not unique in holistic review process.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the “most compelling” applicants evaluated by the College are students who convey themselves “as authentically as possible.”
“In our admissions process, we give careful, individual attention to each applicant,” Dane wrote. “We seek to identify students who will be the best educators of one another and their professors—individuals who will inspire those around them during their College years and beyond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late August, the Harvard field hockey team was gearing up to open its season against the University of New Hampshire. At that time, the squad had no way of knowing that it was about to embark on what would be one of the most successful campaigns in program history.
Starting with New Hampshire, the Crimson trounced its first three opponents before heading into its matchup against then No. 3 Maryland at the Terrapin Invitational on September 9th. This test was a bit too much for the group to handle at the time, as the Terrapins came out on top, 3-1.
However, after leaving College Park, Md. with the bitter taste of defeat in its mouth, Harvard would do something that it had never done before. The group rattled off 13 straight victories, shattering its previous program record of eight consecutive wins.
“I don’t think [this year] has been that much different to be honest,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “We always focus on the process, we focus on reaching our potential, and then have a firm belief that our potential is good enough to compete with anyone in the nation.”
Consistent hard work paired with the proper mindset is something that should never be overlooked. That being said, the statistics reveal that this year’s squad has in fact been fundamentally different than previous iterations.
There is an old mantra in sports that extols, “offense wins games, but defense wins championships,” and it was the Crimson’s stifling defense that catapulted it up to the top of the Ivy League. It is allowing a mere 0.65 goals per game, down substantially from last year’s mark of 1.22. This has more than made up for the slight dip in the team’s scoring average (3.7 goals/game this year compared to 3.8 the previous season).
“I think our defense has really stepped up,” van Herwaarden said. “We don’t allow much to happen in our defensive circle which is great. The depth of the entire squad is fantastic as well. We’re not depending on one or two individuals who score the goals…. We have other people who can step up whenever the situation requires it.”
Depth is extremely important, especially throughout the course of such a long season. The roster brims with players who can contribute. The youngest and the oldest — the freshmen and seniors — have certainly both left their mark, but in different ways.
A new injection of talent is always refreshing for a team, and the group of first-years provides just that. Goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo has started in 11 games and has made an appearance in two others, while midfielder/forward Rachel Greenwood and midfielder Kiley Allen have started in 17 and 16 of Harvard’s contests, respectively.
The seniors, on the other hand, play a role that comes naturally with their experience. They lead by example and stabilize the team, making sure that everyone is focused and ready to go.
“The senior class is exceptional,” van Herwaarden said. “Great leaders and they really are determined to go out and finalize their careers, to go out with a bang. I think their determination and desire to do well is certainly contagious for the rest of the athletes.”
All of these factors have been crucial to the Crimson’s historic win streak. Nevertheless, a team’s record is an incomplete view of how its season has gone. The squad had been able to carve out these victories, but not always by playing at its highest level.
“We had a little dip in the middle of the season,” said junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. “I think we needed that in order to realize we are so much better than that, and we are able to compete with the best in the country.”
Competing with the best in the country is exactly what was required in Harvard’s game against conference rival Princeton on October 20th. The Tigers were ranked as the No. 3 team in the nation heading into the contest, and this late-season matchup was in essence a de-facto Ivy League Championship game.
That Saturday, the Crimson proved to itself and to the rest of the country that it is a legitimate threat. Despite being outshot, goals from three different Harvard players propelled the team to a 3-1 victory over Princeton. The result was a culmination of a season’s worth of focus and improvement.
“Of course we want to win the Ivy League but the most important game is our next game,” van Vlijmen said. “Even if it’s a non-conference game, our most important game is that game and we don’t want to think ahead…. It doesn’t matter who our opponent is. We play every game like we would play the world champion.”
This mindset has paid off, as the Crimson achieved that goal. After entering the game ranked No. 6, a 6-0 thrashing of Dartmouth guaranteed the team at least a share of the Ancient Eight title, the fifth in team history. A second consecutive 6-0 win the following week against Columbia allowed them to clinch it outright.
Nonetheless, the journey Harvard embarked on in August is one that has not reached its conclusion quite yet. Van Herwaarden’s squad will have to maintain its focus, mindset, and hard work if it hopes to make a splash in the NCAA Tournament. It will take a team effort, but confidence is high and the whole roster is willing and ready to build off of what has already been a successful season.
“I feel like, especially after Princeton, the sky’s the limit,” van Vlijmen said. “We beat an opponent who has beaten the best team in the country. Some games we haven’t played to our standards but other games we are really able to show how we play as a team and show our potential.”
The Crimson now prepares to face off against Penn State this Friday, November 9th, in a regional semifinal in Princeton, N.J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hosting its Cambridge neighbors for the first contest of the year, Harvard men’s basketball took home the victory, 78-66, over MIT.
The Crimson (1-0) sprung the game wide open in the first four minutes of the second half, thanks to a string of eight points on four straight possessions from junior forward Chris Lewis, dominating the Engineers’ (0-1) post defense.
The first half of the game proved to be a stalemate, with each team trading blows in a fast-paced frame filled with scoring. It was Harvard, however, that seized the game early in the second half.
“I thought our run at the beginning of the second half was one of the keys to the game,” coach Tommy Amaker said.
Following the halftime break, Lewis re-entered the game. Having not played the previous eight minutes of game time due to foul trouble, he showed some signs of bench rust with an airballed floater down low.
This rust was quickly shaken off, as Lewis silenced the jeers of the MIT student section by hitting a similar layup. The Engineers responded with an airballed three as the clock expired, eliciting similar noise from Harvard’s side of the arena.
MIT students traveled down the Charles in full force, taking up an entire section of the bleachers. The two-mile trek from Kendall to Harvard along the Red Line was not enough to keep the Engineers from Lavietes.
“They come here every year and you know, they wanted to come ready to compete,” junior guard Justin Bassey said. “They bring a lot of fans, and they bring a lot of energy with them.”
On the Crimson side of the arena, the Harvard crowd included former University President Drew Faust, and her successor, Lawrence S. Bacow. Amaker had high praise for the two leaders.
“I've loved how [Faust] talks about how diverse our community has become around our basketball games, and you can just look and see diversity not only in terms of race, but also with students, deans, faculty, professors,” Amaker said. “It's just a whole host of people, the Cambridge community and not just Harvard folks, but Cambridge and Boston.” 
Lewis would score again on the Crimson’s next trip down the court, putting him in the double-digits in scoring. Lewis, again blanketed by multiple defenders in the paint, muscled his way to the rim and knocked down another layup, scoring for a third straight possession. When he beat MIT on another consecutive trip down the court, the Engineers resorted to a foul to keep Lewis from gaining another basket. The junior swished both of his free-throws from the line, giving him eight points on four straight Harvard possessions.
“Certainly with the foul trouble, sitting as long as he did, he was fresh for sure,” Amaker said of Lewis. “I thought he really wanted to make a difference, and we wanted to play through him... Chris really responded for us in the second half and really gave us the confidence as we opened the second half.”
With 16:08 left in the half, Lewis, who had at this point accounted for all of Harvard’s second-half scoring, finally received a well-earned break on the bench just before the first media timeout of the second half.
Despite the forward’s exit, the Crimson offense continued its momentum. Consecutive baskets from sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic, sophomore guard Rio Haskett, and junior forward Harry Welsh,extending Harvard’s lead to 13 points. MIT responded with a three-pointer, but Bassey negated the score with a triple of his own.
Lewis commanded the beginning of the game offensively in the same fashion as the early second half. The first bucket of the game also came from Lewis, this one a layup 1:10 into the contest.
Lewis completed his second layup heavily guarded three minutes in, blanketed by defenders in the paint. This was the story for Lewis while he was on the floor early in the game. The Engineers quickly double-teamed him in an attempt to swallow up the 6’9”, 235 pound forward. Lewis proved he would need even more attention, scoring again and following up with a block on the defensive end of the court. Lewis accounted for six of Harvard’s first eight points before exiting the game due to foul trouble.
The Crimson cycled a new group of five onto the floor following the first media timeout, including freshman guards Noah Kirkwood and Spencer Freedman. Kirkwood, playing in the first minutes of his college career, took the ball at the top of the key and stepped back off the dribble to knock down a contested three for his first career points. Kirkwood would finish the game with 13 points off the bench, good for second most on the team, while Freedman knocked down two threes in the game to finish with six points.
“I know it's tough coming in as a freshman [in the] first game. We've all been there, but those guys did an amazing job,” Bassey said. “...it kind of reflected in the minutes that they played tonight.”
Despite having multiple sets of five to enter the game early on, Harvard was not operating at full strength. The Crimson played without junior standouts in guard Bryce Aiken and forward Seth Towns. The former was 2016-2017’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and the latter is the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year. Aiken missed the majority of last year, while Towns’ injury came in the Ivy League Championship against Penn. 
Following a media timeout, Lewis returned to the floor and quickly earned another layup in the post. The junior picked up his first foul the next trip down the floor, and another foul with 8:43 to play in the half gave MIT an extra point on a made layup and sent Lewis to the bench for the remainder of the half.
“Well, it was was my fault for getting to early fouls,” Lewis said. “But I trusted my teammates completely. I knew that my team was going to defend and put as much effort as they can.”
The old-fashioned three-point play made the score 22-20 and put the Engineers within striking distance of Harvard’s lead. Just over a minute later, the Crimson was unable to secure multiple defensive rebounds and committed a foul under the net. MIT hit both free-throws to tie the game at 22. Harvard was able to stop the bleeding with a Bassey triple from the right wing to retake the lead.
The Engineers would answer, tipping in a rebound and then knocking down a jumper to take its first lead, 26-25. Again, the Crimson would not let any runs form, with Freedman grabbing his first points of the game, and his career, on a triple. After each team traded points, MIT’s Hinkley followed up with a three-pointer that gave the Engineers another lead heading into the final media timeout of the of the half.
Following some back-and-forth play, Bassey hit a three-pointer from the corner with the shot clock winding down. A pump-fake put the MIT defender in the air and drew a foul, giving Bassey an opportunity for the rare four-point play. This time, he converted from the foul stripe.
With under a minute to go, a collision at half court sent Bassey to the bench with an injury. He would remain on the bench with staff until the end of the half.
With the score 40-39, Harvard’s last possession came up empty. A half-court shot from the Engineers rattled around the rim, sending the game into the half with the two teams separated by only a point.
With just under eight minutes to play, MIT’s offense was showing some signs of life, keeping the deficit hovering around eight points. Just before the media timeout, Lewis tore through three defenders and rose above the crowded paint to throw down a contested one-handed slam, slowing the Engineers’ momentum.
A three-pointer from MIT with 6:30 pulled the game within five points, the first time the deficit had fallen below eight in nearly ten minutes. The Engineers were unable to seize the available momentum, missing the front-end of a one-and-one after entering the bonus. With the offenses stalling and a media timeout looming, Amaker took a timeout with 4:44 left in the contest.
The Crimson struck first after the quick break, with a Djuricic layup giving Harvard back its double-digit lead, but the offenses stalled again, with no points being scored for the next two minutes.
With under two minutes to play, a hard-working Djuricic scrambled through multiple MIT rebounders to grab an offensive board and buy the Crimson a new shot clock, effectively sealing the game for Harvard.
