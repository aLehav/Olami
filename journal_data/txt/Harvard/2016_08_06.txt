After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yuga J. Cohler ’11 has never really settled down: After obtaining a degree from Harvard in computer science, he became the youngest graduate of the Juilliard School’s conducting Master’s program and now serves as music director for Los Angeles’s Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra—while working as a software engineer for Google. His latest musical project, “Yeethoven,” which received coverage from publications like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone, made an unlikely combination of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Kanye West. Cohler is also a notable alumnus of the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, where he began his conducting career. In support of Tanglewood’s upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations on Aug. 6, Cohler sat down with The Crimson to talk about music, interdisciplinary thinking, and art in the age of the Internet.
The Harvard Crimson: How did learning computer science influence you as a musician?
Yuga J. Cohler: What I love about computer science and math is the structural and ordered thinking and the level of organization it demands of you. What I love about music is the exact opposite: You can do whatever you want. I think there are people who take conducting as: The composer wrote this, and you have to remain super faithful to the score and every single detail... but if what I wanted to do was mechanically reproduce stuff, then I would just be a software engineer. I love the liberties you can take with music, which ties into why I did a project like “Yeethoven.” Recently, on a macro scale, I think as a conductor and an artist who’s trying to accomplish things beyond one concert, I think that sort of competency of organization, modularizing things, is very useful.
THC: What are some of the biggest challenges you’ve faced in pursuing engineering and conducting?
YJC: I think for me, personally, it comes down to a question of identity. I’m half-Japanese—my first language is Japanese—but I grew up here, so negotiating those two identities have been interesting with its challenges. I’ve liked music and also arts and sciences; I’ve always done both. So… there was this question of, “Now I have to decide what I’m going to do….” And I think in any industry there’s an enormous amount of pressure to have a pure way of pursuing what you do. Coming out of Juilliard, there’s this traditional path of becoming a conductor… and if you deviate from that path, it’s like, “Oh, you’re not taking music seriously.” That was an existential struggle I had at the end of graduate school…. What I’ve eventually come to realize is that that’s nonsense…. It’s this system that’s been set up to make people feel secure. I feel extremely liberated by the fact that I’ve been able to do what I want, exactly what it is that I want. That’s kept me focused on my goals and helped me transcend certain expectations that have been set for me. Like, “If you work as a software engineer, you can’t be a serious musician,” or vice versa. But actually, my goal is to do both in a meaningful way and maybe to combine them in a meaningful way, to bring about a change in the culture. I think the greatest people… that’s exactly what they do. You think of a Steve Jobs or a Kanye—they just knocked down the expectations that have been set for them. That, for me, has been the biggest challenge. It’s a question of identity…. Confronting that head-on has been the most rewarding, I think.
THC: What’s a pleasant surprise you’ve encountered?
YJC: The pleasant surprise is just how open people are to anything—to new ways of thinking, new ways of listening, new experiences. If you present it in a compelling way, people will follow. There are countless examples of this that inspire me to no end. Like “Hamilton,” right? “Oh, you can never have hip-hop in a Broadway show”—it’s the most popular show ever now. That’s one example. A lot of cooks inspire me. There are all of these rules set up by the French kitchen. Things have to be prepared a certain way, a certain order of dishes. I watch this Netflix series called “Chef’s Table,” and there’s this great episode about a Japanese restaurant in L.A. The first thing is, it’s run by a female head chef, which is rare. The second moment I was like, oh, this is so awesome: It’s a Japanese restaurant, except in something like the fourth course, they serve pasta, just straight-up Italian food. And everyone’s like, “No, you can’t do it! What are you doing, you’re ruining the sanctity!” But it’s an unbelievably popular restaurant. There are no rules…. If it works, it works, and the fact that people in general reward and recognize that is incredibly heartening.
THC: You said you always have a goal—is there any direction you would like to see classical music or music industries at large move toward in the near future?
YJC: For me, the goal that I have right now is to get American people to think more. I think in the age of the Internet and… of extremely polarized politics, of clickbait headlines and 10-second videos… either there’s been a decline in serious, substantial thought, or it’s exposing the lack thereof there always was. I’m not sure which it is. But in my view we could all be taking a moment to think more. So that’s sort of my goal right now. I think music is a great way of allowing that to happen. One way is by breaking barriers: “Hey, this type of music is actually, if you think about it, quite similar to this other type of music.” Or: “Oh, listen to this interesting piece which you claim you don’t like. Let’s think about why you don’t like it or why you do like it. Here are some elements.” And it’s a great platform for encouraging thought because it’s sort of meaningless. As long as there are no words… there’s no intrinsic meaning. As charged as a lot of other things can be, and as charged as claims of ownership or how much you like certain types of music can be, it’s a great platform for challenging preconceived notions and the way people think…. And clearly technology also has to be part of this process--it’s by and large technology that either exposed or created this problem, in a sense, so it has to be part of the solution, and I’m also looking forward to exploring that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, I took a train out to Long Island to meet my grandparents at their friends’ house. As I walked in the door, I gave and received a kiss on the cheek from every man and woman, most of whom I either didn’t know or had met when I was too young to remember. At one point, one of them held my shoulders and took a step back for a better look before saying, “sheesh, you look just like your fahhtha.”
They asked how my father was doing, said that he should visit some time. They regaled me with old stories of my father’s Little League games many years ago—“lemme tell yuh, you shoulda seem him out in centa field, oooh gawd could the kid flahy. And when he was battin’? Fugetaboutit.”
When an Italian tells a story, you see the passion in their eyes. You feel like you were actually there when it happened. You feel it in your bones.
The men sat outside trading old New York sports stories all afternoon while the women sat inside, playing cards and cooking tremendous portions of food; everyone occasionally exploded into laughter. An hour and a plate of caprese salad and prosciutto rolls later, we gathered around the meticulously prepared table for dinner.
Two hours and four courses later, we migrated to the living room. The grand piano, covered in more pictures than hang in my whole house, was the centerpiece of the room.
Our host sat down and dove headfirst into a beautiful Italian tune. Many hummed along and slowly bobbed their heads, simultaneously enchanted by the seductive melody and third degree food coma. Without warning, “The Twelve Days of Christmas” began and verses were assigned; I had “two turtle doves.” Within seconds, it was Christmas in July.
On the way home that night, I was exhausted and impossibly full. The funny thing, though, is the utter normalcy of the evening for everyone else. For me, it was an extraordinary night of family, rivaled only by Thanksgiving and Christmas. But for Italians like our hosts, it was business as usual.
If you’re Italian, you host dinners as if you were serving kings. Dinner is an extravagant, multi-course, all-day, all-night family event, and family gets the best: the freshest food, the neatest table, and the greatest company.
Now, to me, an ethnically impure millennial, dinner is a much simpler affair—simply spooning myself a serving from a pot on the stovetop, and grabbing a seat near the kitchen TV. Afterward, we might run off to resume our homework or our pre-dinner activities, which almost always involved an electronic screen. Clearly, things have changed drastically.
It is no revelation that our culture is under a constant, unwavering, and insuppressible pressure to change. Change—gradual and unrelenting—is never immediately noticed, yet beats onward without fail.
It is bewildering, however, when you realize the vast cultural gap created by a mere two generations.
In the days of our grandparents, the men sat outside and the women inside. The men chatted and smoked; the women cooked. A cell phone was the last thing on a person’s mind. Sunday—the entire day—was for God and for family. You spoke your mind openly, without regard for offense or marred pride. Skin was thicker, but generally less colorful. You went to college close to home; you lived and died in the same town where you were born.
Just as Mother Nature can bring both destructive hurricanes and drought-ending rains, transformations of societal conventions bring both positive and misguided shifts in cultural normalcy.
Society is more integrated now than it was two generations ago, no longer so black and white. Sundays aren’t only for God—or more accurately, for Christians—because we aren’t only Christians anymore. Men and women grow closer to parity every day. More people have squeezed into big cities, living amongst a wider breadth of cultures and lifestyles. Society is also more ideologically divided, and we are more afraid; we don’t speak up as much anymore. We don’t want to hurt, to inflict or receive.
And the changes aren’t only demographic. For those not in big cities, there are seemingly endless ways to connect to people across the country and around the world. The massive wave of technology and social media has brought us closer to those farthest away from us, but pulled us away from those nearest to us. Today, teenagers venture farther away for college, and often move out of their hometown afterward. There is less sense of community, less commitment to family, but more opportunity.
Naturally, these inevitable changes divide opinion. Personally, I hate that, today, dinner is less about family and more about eating (and nowadays, often too much). And dinner is often interrupted by beeps and vibrations. Sometimes I wish that electronics—our sources of instant knowhow—would vanish and that we would instead notice the stories deep in each others’ eyes. We should strive to find God (or any spiritual guidance) on any day of the week. I hope we never get used to the convenience of big cities and relish being off the beaten path.
Change is sometimes a double-edged sword. Attitudes shift. Sometimes we can control it. But often, we can’t. Grandparents will always say “I miss the old days,” and we’ll usually say, “I like the new days better.”
Change is bittersweet, simultaneously positive and negative, depending on whom you ask. In all honesty, I don’t know what to make of it. Heck, I just realized these things because earlier this week, I was Italian company for the night.
I can only wonder what lies in store for me tomorrow.
