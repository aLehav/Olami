The new “Game of Thrones” trailer dropped last Tuesday — and, as expected, it broke the Internet. Fantasy-loving twenty-somethings screeched with joy in their basements. Thousands of devoted fans shook off the uneasy feeling one gets after realizing they are romantically and sexually rooting for two people who are aunt and nephew to get together. Innumerable one-off pieces dissecting each frame of the two-minute trailer popped up across the blogosphere.
But looming over this fervor is an obvious yet unspoken problem: Is anyone going to admit that they cannot see a single thing? Or did showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss initiate a global syndicate that brainwashed the masses into perceiving their failing computer screens as incandescent IMAX displays?
The new trailer is so dark that it is literally impossible to know what is going on, and anyone who says otherwise is flat-out lying. The only plausible explanation is that all information has been collectively gleaned from those cultural super-consumers on Buzzfeed and Reddit who pause on every frame and enhance the brightness before explaining its cryptic contents. “Game of Thrones” trailers have been consistently dark, but qualitatively speaking, this one reaches new levels of unviewable.
Take, for example, just the first 30 seconds. Is that Arya running in the tombs? No, it’s just Winterfell at night. No, there’s Tormund, maybe he’s pacing those quirky little tunnels inside the Wall. But is he indoors or is it nighttime? Ah, now some daylight. But is it early morning? Late dusk? Where is the sun?
Yes, I get it: Winter is Coming. Sunlight and humanity are being stamped out by the snowy fury of the White Walkers. Life in Westeros is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short, or whatever. But seriously, there are other ways to indicate both metaphysical and meteorological impending doom than shooting an entire blockbuster series through the least dilated aperture ever witnessed by humankind. With a budget of over $90 million for the season, HBO couldn’t afford a few extra studio lights?
There are maybe three or four well-lit shots in the two-minute teaser. All of them involve dragons, Sansa Stark’s luminous face (what skincare voodoo are they on in the North?), or some combination of the two. Even in a drama awash with garish good/evil, dark/light symbolism, this editing is almost egregiously heavy-handed. Moral dichotomies can be conveyed in many variations of grayscale, not just third-grade shades of black and white. The simplicity of darkness as a signaling device for dramatic legitimacy is infuriating to the point of that it depreciates the show itself.
Plus, lots of Serious Dramas use gorgeous color to great effect. Vulture picked up on this unnecessary darkness of serious shows way back in 2016, citing “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men” as dramas that actually plumbed the inky depths of the color wheel and still, magically, garnered critical acclaim.
But the epidemic of dimness has only worsened in the last few years, and “Game of Thrones” was always a major part of the problem. Based on this trailer, all hope is lost that the show has some brighter tricks up its sleeve in its final season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK — Standing opposite the Harvard Club of New York and surrounded by cameras, microphones, and lawyers, a Connecticut woman announced Wednesday that she has sued Harvard to gain the rights to historic photos of enslaved people she says are her ancestors — and to challenge the University’s continued ties to slavery.
The plaintiff, Tamara K. Lanier, filed suit against Harvard in Middlesex Superior Court Wednesday, alleging that the University unlawfully possesses and profits from the photos, which are believed to be some of the oldest photos of American slaves in existence. The photos — commissioned by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz in the 19th century in an attempt to prove a scientific theory of white superiority — depict Lanier’s great-great-great grandfather, Renty, and his daughter, Delia, according to the complaint.
Lanier argues that Renty and Delia could not have consented to being photographed at the time and could not own the photographs Agassiz made. She also alleges that the University has refused to acknowledge her relation to Renty and Delia and has refused to return the photos to her. The images are currently housed in the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, which Lanier also names as a defendant in the lawsuit.
In the suit, Lanier request that the University turn the daguerreotypes over to her, give up all profits it has made off the photos, and pay punitive damages to her. She is also asking Harvard to acknowledge “that it was complicit in perpetuating and justifying the institution of slavery.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the suit on behalf of the University, writing in an email that Harvard had not yet been served Lanier’s complaint.
Civil rights attorney Benjamin L. Crump — who has represented the families of victims of police violence such as Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice — is serving as counsel for Lanier. Crump wrote on Twitter that Lanier’s case may turn out to be one of the most important lawsuits since Brown v. Board of Education.
“When Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, we at least were under the impression, under the belief, that finally black people owned their person, and incumbent in that was ownership of our image,” Crump said at a press conference Wednesday. “But Harvard is saying to Tammy Lanier and her family that Renty still is a slave, he still does not own his image.”
“This lawsuit is setting a precedent, because not only is it fighting for the linear descendants of Renty, but it is also fighting for the linear descendants of all African slaves,” he added.
Harvard’s complicity in the American slave trade has become a topic of increasing campus conversation in recent years. In 2016, after student protests, the University disposed of the Harvard Law School seal, which referenced the crest of a slaveholding donor family; that same year, then-University President Drew G. Faust convened a faculty committee to advise the University on researching Harvard’s ties to slavery. More recently, Harvard joined the University of Virginia’s Universities Studying Slavery initiative.
But Lanier’s lawsuit alleges that, by refusing her ownership of the photos, the University perpetuates its ties to slavery.
The complaint — which contains a five-part narrative history of the life of Renty and the history of the daguerreotypes — states that Agassiz commissioned the photos of Renty and Delia as part of an effort to document physical evidence of polygenism, the theory that different racial groups do not share a common biological origin. Defenders of slavery in the 19th century used polygenism to argue that African and African-American people were genetically distinct from and inferior to white people.
The complaint states that, as subjects in Agassiz’s study, Renty and Delia were “stripped naked and forced to pose for the daguerreotypes without consent, dignity, or compensation.”
“Responsibility for that crime lies squarely with Harvard, which elevated Agassiz to the highest echelons of academia and steadfastly supported him as he promoted and legitimized the poisonous myth of white superiority,” the complaint reads.
Lanier said at the press conference that she first connected herself to Renty and the photographs through the oral history her mother passed down to her from childhood.
“The story really begins with my mother,” Lanier said. “She held on to a story that's been told now for 160 some-odd years, and she made sure that I, my sisters and brothers, and my children, her grandchildren, knew the story.”
“It was important to her that I documented the story,” she added.
Lanier’s lawyers wrote in the complaint that, after her mother’s death, Lanier conducted interviews, searched libraries and archives, and browsed online “genealogy sources” in a “years-long journey” to document the connection between Renty and her family.
That journey eventually led her to Harvard. In 2011, Lanier wrote a letter to Faust asking that Harvard review the documentation she had collected and provide more information about how the University had used the daguerrotypes.
Faust allegedly responded that the Peabody Museum — which had possessed the photos since an employee found them in the museum’s attic in the 1970s — was “involved in projects regarding those daguerreotypes” and would contact Lanier if they learned any new information, according to the complaint. The complaint states that no one contacted Lanier further about “ongoing projects, new information, or interest in verifying her lineage and connection to the daguerreotypes.”
The complaint also alleges that the University and the museum continue to profit off of the images. In 2017, the Peabody published the image of Renty on the cover of the 30th anniversary edition of “From Site to Sight: Anthropology, Photography and the Power of Imagery,” which is distributed through Harvard University Press.
The complaint alleges that Harvard charges a “hefty ‘licensing’ fee” for use of the photographs.
University spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement on behalf of the Peabody Museum that the Peabody does not currently charge to license the images and that the photos are in the public domain. The museum charges $15 to produce a high resolution image of the daguerreotypes, for which it receives around 10 requests per year on average.
Dane also wrote that about 122 copies of “From Sight to Site” have been sold at $40 each, and that the Peabody receives $16 per copy sold.
Lanier said at the Wednesday press conference that it has been “painful” to see Harvard reproduce the images, both on the textbook and in publications for a conference on slavery she attended at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study last year. She wrote in her complaint that she has experienced emotional distress as a result of Harvard’s conduct and asked to be compensated for “emotional distress, humiliation, anxiety, and other emotional pain and suffering.”
“Initially, when I first saw the image, I found some pleasure in seeing the image of the person that I had heard so much about,” Lanier said. “But then, when I measured that against the ugly stories about Louis Agassiz… I was very, very disappointed, and I felt solace in the fact that my mother had passed before she could have seen the image.”
Joshua D. Koskoff, another of Lanier’s lawyers, added that the University has misrepresented Renty, rendering him “invisible” by not acknowledging his life story and his descendants.
“What does Harvard today say about Renty and Agassiz?” Koskoff said. “About Renty, they say he was anonymous, invisible; about Agassiz, they talk about him being a celebrated, famous and brilliant scientist.”
“So as much as the case is about all the things we are talking about, in its purest sense, it is a search for the truth,” he added.
If Lanier wins the rights to the daguerreotypes, Crump said they intend to take the photos on a tour across the United States — naming Detroit, Oakland, Los Angeles, and St. Louis as possible stops — before finally loaning them to museums.
“What I hope we’re able to accomplish is to show the world who Renty is and tell that story,” Lanier said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON D.C. — Harvard men's basketball drew the sixth seed in the NIT Opener and will face No. 3 Georgetown on Wednesday night. The game will be played on Gerogetown's campus at the 2,500-seat McDonough Arena and will be televised nationally on ESPN2 at 7PM.
The Crimson fell short of its first berth in the NCAA Tournament since 2015, dropping in the second half to Yale in the Ivy Tournament final. Due to winning the Ancient Eight regular season title, Harvard earned an auto-bid to the NIT. Bryce Aiken is coming off a 38-point performance in the loss, continuing his offensive dominance since returning from knee injury at the setart of Ivy season.
Georgetown is led by senior Jessie Govan, a Big-East first teamer, as well as three freshmen: James Akinjo, Mac McClung, and Josh LeBlanc. The Hoyas lost to Seton Hall in the conference quarterfinals and finished 9-9 in regular-season play. This is Georgetown coach Patrick Ewing's second season in charge of his alma mater.
Tonight's game will also feature a variety of experimental rules, inclulding an extended three-point line, wider lanes, and the replacement of one-and-ones with a foul-reset scenario after the midway point of each half. The winners of this contest will play NC State on Saturday night in Raleigh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C. - It was like watching the same movie all over again.
Four nights after giving up a seven point second half lead on the road in the Ivy League Championship, Harvard men’s basketball had a five point lead evaporate. The Crimson allowed a 6-0 Georgetown run, as a raucous McDonough Arena crowd willed on the Hoyas in the first round of the NIT.
But with three minutes left in its season, the Crimson found the grit and composure to fight back on both ends of the floor, riding cagey point guard play and clutch free throw shooting from Bryce Aiken to a 71-68 win, a signature moment of the 2018-2019 season.
The junior, who attempted an uncharacteristically low nine field goals, drew two critical fouls late in the game, and scored the final six points of the game for the visitors. The Randolph, N.J., native finished with a team-high 18 points, but his savvy veteran presence in the dying moments of the game were amongst the biggest highlights of Wednesday night’s victory. 
"We use Bryce in all those particular positions, so on the ball, off the ball, he's such a dynamic backcourt player,” Coach Tommy Amaker said. “Tremendous scorer and people do a lot to try to take it away from him and keep it out of his hands so it's hard.”
Amaker opted for an unconventional lineup, with junior guard Christian Juzang missing due to illness. Senior captain Weisner Perez was inserted into the starting five, and the Berwyn, Ill., native provided energy and effort from the get-go.
In the opening minutes, Perez converted a layup and and-one, registering four rebounds and five points by the first TV timeout, propelling the team to a 13-6 lead. Those five points were more than he had scored all season, and Perez’s energy on the offensive glass set the tone on a night when the Crimson would out-rebound a physically gifted Hoyas’ team by a 39-30 margin.
“Weisner Perez at the start for us tonight was outstanding,” Amaker said. “Great team win for our program and certainly to win in the postseason is such a wonderful feeling.”
Georgetown freshman Mac McClung provided an early lift for the Hoyas, with six quick points as the hosts brought the score back to even by the second media timeout. Georgetown’s size provided immediate issues on the inside, with Ewing’s side taking advantage of the Crimson’s smaller lineups offensively, and igniting a capacity crowd. With the Hoyas playing most of their games at the Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, the unorthodox on-campus game, due to a Capitals game previously scheduled, allowed for a loud, energized environment. 
Despite its limited size, Harvard earned a plethora of offensive rebounds in the opening portion of the contest. The visitors out-rebounded the Hoyas 14-9 at the nine-minute mark, including six on the offensive end. The Crimson, however, got itself into a scoring slump but held ground on the opposite end, with the Georgetown lead at just two heading into the final eight minutes of the half.
Aiken finally broke that drought with a three to put Harvard back in front 19-18, as Perez returned to the court after early success in the game. Junior Robert Baker, who also had seen multiple DNPs to finish the season, checked in to the contest at the 5:32 mark as Govan’s size equated to fouls for Chris Lewis. Henry Welsh quickly followed suit. The junior tallied an immediate lay-up in front of his brother Thomas Welsh, a two-way player with the Denver Nuggets, who was in town to play the Wizards tomorrow night.
The Hoyas pushed to its own small run to energize the strong student contingency, but the Crimson answered back to even things back at 30 as Welsh drove in uncontested for his second layup.
Both teams struggled from beyond the arc with the extended three-point line, as Harvard shot 1-of-10 compared to 1-of-8 from the Hoyas in the first half. After going for a career-high 38 points against Yale, Aiken returned back to the locker room still looking to rediscover his groove. But a mark of five consecutive field goals from the rest of Aiken’s team stood up to a late spurt by Georgetown freshman James Akinjo, and the Crimson trailed by just a one-point margin heading into the half.
"I didn't really have to adjust much,” said Aiken of the NIT’s extended three-point line. “Inherently knowing where that three point line is in the game is different than, you know, than what we're used to.”
Bassey kicked off the second half with a triple and Lewis finished a righty hook to put the Crimson back on top 40-36. But Jessie Govan caught on fire from deep, draining two threes to even the score back at 42-42. Aiken returned the favor with a three of his own, but not before Govan drained another triple. The Georgetown senior big finally missed on his fourth “heat check” attempt, but the Hoyas had all of the positive energy it needed and began to widen the margin heading into the the second media timeout.
“Govan was excellent — his threes and spreading the floor for with how big he is, it is very hard,” said Amaker of locking down the 6’10 senior, who finished with 25 points. “His quickness with the backcourt players put a lot of pressure on the defense.”
As the second half ticked on, Aiken re-entered and began to assert his will. But the late 6-0 run from the hosts threatened to end the Crimson’s season. But when Amaker called a timeout with 3:36 and Harvard trailing, the visitors had a moment to catch their breaths.
With the game slipping out of reach, mentally weaker teams might have given in. But with its backs against the wall, playing for the careers of seniors like Perez, the Crimson refused to go quietly into the night. Cutting down on turnovers and out-scoring the Hoyas 10-2 in second half bench points, Harvard were able to put the finishing touches on its most impressive victory of the season.
“Both teams competed very hard,” Amaker said of the victory. “For us to get a win on the road in a national tournament is such a wonderful experience and feeling for us in our program.”
It would have been understandable for the Crimson to fold. As the crowd got louder, and the Hoyas’ run extended, giving the hosts the lead, the odds seemed stacked against Harvard. After all, just four nights earlier, the Crimson had suffered a heart-wrenching loss to the hands of rival Yale, and found itself going up against the momentum of the crowd, and Govan and the rest of Coach Patrick Ewing's team. 
But with the season at its most precipitous point, Amaker’s team found a way to fight back. Five players finished with nine points or more, a testament to the balance of the team.
Harvard will travel to play N.C. State in Raleigh on Sunday, facing yet another do-or-die game. But with the Crimson two wins from Madison Square Garden, it seems appropriate to appreciate the significance of going on the road, and knocking off Georgetown, one of college basketball’s greatest blue bloods.
