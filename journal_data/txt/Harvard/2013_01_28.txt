After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday The Crimson editorial board praised President Obama’s inauguration speech for his progressive stance on gay rights and climate change, while chiding him for his defense of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. The Crimson worries that President Obama’s rhetoric will prevent the “serious” work of cutting entitlements.
It’s a curious criticism. For the last four years, President Obama has been all too eager to cut Social Security and Medicare. Early in his presidency he created a commission to investigate ways to reduce the debt including cuts to entitlement programs. As recently as December he proposed a measure that would have changed the formula for calculating Social Security benefits, resulting in smaller checks for seniors. Without intense opposition from progressive advocacy groups and political stubbornness from House Republicans, President Obama would already have delivered cuts to Medicare and Social Security.
But in his inauguration speech, the president shifted his position. For the first time, he explained the vital importance of our social welfare system: “Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security… strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.”
President Obama took a big step forward by representing these programs as the cornerstone of our society instead of numbers on a budget line. It’s all too easy to point to numbers on charts and argue that cutting entitlement programs would reduce the debt. But such casual mathematics ignores the human cost of cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.
People who rely on Medicare are struggling to hold on until 65 as it is. West Virginia miners and South Carolina schoolteachers cannot afford to wait until 69 for Medicare. Cutting their Social Security check means forcing them to choose between prescription drugs or the electricity bill. And to cut Medicaid is to deprive impoverished children and families of the care they need. Cuts to these programs affect those who need it the most.
Americans believe in these programs. A December 2012 Marist/McClatchy poll found 74 percent of voters and even 68 percent of Republicans oppose cuts to Medicare. 70 percent oppose Medicaid cuts. A January New York Times/CBS poll found voters preferred cuts in military spending to cuts in Medicare and Social Security by more than two to one.
Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all support our social welfare system because it works. Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid keep the elderly from using all their savings to pay for medical bills. They keep people from starving on the street.  Without these programs, 20 million people would be in poverty, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Protecting the poor, the elderly, and the disabled expresses a belief in collective action. Life can be unpredictable and harsh, but no one should have to starve in a poorhouse. By supporting each other as a society, we can make our nation great.
Advocates for reducing the deficit by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid don’t believe that. Groups like Fix the Debt and the Peterson Foundation have spent decades hosting policy briefings, airing TV ads, and lobbying Congress to create fear about deficits. They have defined seriousness as a willingness to cut social welfare programs. If they were truly concerned about deficits, they would also advocate policies like raising taxes on the wealthy, cutting military spending, and ending corporate subsidies. The laser focus on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid reflects a belief that government should be favorable to the wealthy and corporations.
Cutting our social welfare system is not serious or brave. It is an endorsement of government for the wealthy, who have no need for such programs. They fought tooth and nail against the creation of Social Security under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It took another 22 years of exhaustive legislative battles before Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law. The day it passed the Senate, Johnson declared, “It is a great day for America.” Medicare, he said, “will bring the necessary satisfaction of having fulfilled the obligation of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and labor to their country.”
President Obama recognized that last Monday. If he wants to continue to make our country great, he will protect and expand the social welfare programs that make it so.

Dartmouth’s decision to stop accepting top scores on Advanced Placement exams as stand-ins for introductory-level classes starting with the Class of 2018 reflects recent skepticism around the A.P. exams’ ability to prepare high school students for college.
MIT felt similarly in 2007 when they deemed that students who had earned a five on the A.P. Biology exam did not necessarily have the skills required to succeed in upper-level Biology courses.
Dartmouth decided to change their A.P. policy after the psychology department designed an experiment to test how incoming freshmen that had scored a five on their A.P. psychology test compared to students who have completed the introductory-level psychology class. The department created a condensed version of the class’s final and administered it to the incoming freshman. Ninety percent of the students who had earned a five on the A.P exam failed.
We believe that the Dartmouth psychology department’s experiment exposes a flaw in the A.P. scoring system rather than a fundamental problem with the idea of earning credit for high school work.  Test takers who receive fives on an A.P. exam may have vastly differing levels of understanding of the subject material.  In order to serve our nation’s wide spectrum of colleges and universities, the A.P. system would be more useful if there were a more sensitive scale than just one through five.
The A.P. exam has experienced incredible expansion in recent years, with two million students taking 3.7 million exams last year, more than doubling enrollment in a decade. Seventy-five percent of teachers polled in 2009 believed school administrators looking to improve the school’s reputation and ranking were pushing students into A.P. courses. The A.P. exam distributes the grades based on the distribution of test scores. Thus with the increasing number of potentially unprepared students taking the test, the threshold for earning a four and five is lowered.  A more sensitive scale would allow students and universities to have a better understanding of whether a given student is prepared for upper-level classes.
We believe that the decision to eliminate the ability to graduate early by using high school credit is an especially important and serious one considering the debt burden borne by so many students. In an interview with the Washington Post, Kate Lyon, a 2005 Dartmouth graduate, disagrees with her alma mater’s policy change, as she appreciated being able to save $15,000 by using her A.P. credit. It is unfair to deprive future ambitious students from seizing the opportunity to graduate early.
The A.P. program clearly has much room for improvement, but with student loan delinquency exceeding credit card delinquency for the first time ever, Dartmouth’s decision seems inadequately justified. We encourage Dartmouth and other universities to support improvements to the A.P. exam, such as a more sensitive grading scale, but hope that they continue to honor high school accomplishments.

Harvard Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson filed an amicus brief Thursday arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court does not have the constitutional power to rule on United States v. Windsor, the landmark case challenging the way marriage is defined in the Defense of Marriage Act.
In the 40-page filing, Jackson argued that the justices do not have the jurisdiction to hear the case because President Barack Obama’s administration, which has stopped defending the controversial law, agrees with a lower court ruling deeming DOMA unconstitutional.
Jackson’s brief also contends that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, a Republican majority body in the House of Representatives, does not have legal standing to defend DOMA under Article III of the Constitution because Congress does not have the right to defend laws which do not specifically relate to its duties.
According to the brief, “the interest here in assuring that [DOMA] is enforced is a generalized one” which falls under the domain of the executive branch, not that of Congress.
At press time, Jackson could not be reached for comment on the brief.
The United States v. Windsor case addresses the constitutionality of section three of DOMA, which states that “the word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word ‘spouse’ refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.’”
In particular, the justices are slated to rule on whether DOMA violates the Fifth Amendment’s equal protection component of the due process clause by excluding same-sex couples legally married in their own state.
The Court asked Jackson to write the brief shortly after it agreed to hear two cases addressing gay marriage, United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case challenging California’s Proposition 8.
The Court will hear the oral arguments for Hollingsworth v. Perry on March 26 and United States v. Windsor on March 27. It is expected to issue decisions on both cases in June. If the justices take Jackson’s advice, however, they will likely not have time to rule on another DOMA case this year.
Jackson, who has published extensively on constitutional law and the Supreme Court, joined the Law School faculty as a professor in 2011 after working at the Georgetown University Law Center. This semester, she is scheduled to teach “Comparative Constitutional Law” and a seminar called “Proportionality as a Transnational Principle,” according to the Law School course catalog.

Although divisions over the Affordable Care Act persist along party lines, there is widespread public support for the extension and revision of Medicare, according to a recent joint survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and two partner organizations.
Fifty-eight percent of individuals surveyed in the study said they oppose any spending cuts to Medicare, even as 65 percent of respondents said that America needs to tighten its fiscal belt to bring down the deficit.
When asked specifically about proposals to trim the cost of Medicare, 85 percent of people surveyed said they support requiring drug companies to subsidize medication at a lower cost for low-income people. Fifty-nine percent of respondents voiced support for mandating high-income seniors to pay higher premiums for Medicare, which provides health insurance to seniors and people with certain disabilities.
Proposals that would require all seniors to pay higher Medicare premiums and raise the age of Medicare eligibility were both rejected by a majority of surveyed individuals.The survey found greater differences of opinion on the issues of expanding Medicaid—which provides health insurance for the poor and people with certain disabilities—and modifying the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care reform law that was passed in 2010.
In total, fifty-two percent of surveyed Americans said they wanted their state to expand its Medicaid program. But while this proposal drew support from 75 percent of Democrats surveyed, it was backed by only 34 percent of Republicans.
And while 52 percent of people surveyed said they thought the Affordable Care Act should be modified to lessen the tax impact on citizens, companies, and health care providers, that proposal drew support primarily from Republicans, who endorsed it by a nearly 4 to 1 ratio.
The survey was conducted by phone by researchers from the School of Public Health, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
John E. McDonough, a professor of the practice of public health at the School of Public Health who was not involved in conducting the study, said that part of the ideological division over the law stems from differing views on the proper role of government in society. McDonough, who assisted the Senate as a policy adviser during a two-year stint on Capitol Hill when the law was being developed and passed, said he did not believe there was “any agreement” about government-run insurance programs in today’s society.
“Limited government is in the eyes of the beholder,” McDonough said. McDonough said that disagreement over the Affordable Care Act also stems from differences in opinion about the role private insurance companies should play in distributing medical care.

Five students will meet with the Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility this Friday to discuss the details of a social choice fund, the creation of which the University announced in December.
Three representatives from the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition—Michael E. Danto ’13, Nicole E. Granath ’15, and Samuel F. Wohns ’14—and the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council—Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Q. Zhu ’14—will attend the 45-minute meeting with two members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, who sit on the CCSR.
Wohns, the alumni coordinator of Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, said that the meeting would help his group decide whether or not to give the approximately $11,000 in the Fair Harvard Fund to the Harvard-managed social choice fund. The Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition originally created the Fair Harvard Fund to show support for socially responsible investing, hoping that the University’s endowment managers at Harvard Management Company would take it over eventually.
We’ll need to hear a credible commitment to the sustainability of the social choice fund,” Wohns said.
Transparency, a promise to advertise the fund to potential donors, and oversight by students, alumni, and faculty would be important factors in the dicussion, according to Wohns.“We’re very optimistic that Friday’s meeting will lead to an agreement,” he said.
Harvard’s social choice fund, which the University announced after months of pressure from students and alumni, will be established in July and invested in one or more mutual funds that the CCSR deems socially responsible. Income from those investments will contribute to student financial aid.
Yet to be decided are the particular mutual funds that will be employed and how transparent the fund’s investments will be.
“We intend to explain to the CCSR that we think that the social fund is an incredibly important and historic first step on Harvard’s path towards becoming a leading socially responsible investor,” Wohns said.
Wohns explained that many advocates of socially responsible investing were disappointed that Harvard had not chosen to put the entire endowment in so-called socially responsible investments, and said that he hoped the University would take additional steps in that direction.
Raghuveer, who will represent the UC at the meeting, said that to her knowledge this type of meeting between the Corporation and students is “relatively unprecedented.”
“I’m really excited that this meeting is happening,” Raghuveer said. “It’s a great step for activism on campus.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote that members of the CCSR and Office of Alumni Affairs and Development were looking forward to learning about students’ views on how the fund should operate and what its goals should be.
Earlier on Friday, members of Students for a Just and Stable Future—an organization dedicated to finding solutions to the climate crisis—also will meet with the CCSR to advocate divestment from fossil fuels, according to the group’s communications coordinator Alli J. Welton ’15.
Last November, a UC referendum advocating fossil fuel divestment passed with 72 percent of the vote, but a week later, Galvin told The Crimson that Harvard was “not considering divesting from companies related to fossil fuels.”

A focus group of Undergraduate Council representatives released a report early this month examining the University’s policies on guns, discussing the history of gun-related incidents on campus, and recommending policy actions to prevent campus shootings.
“For the most part, we found that the [current] Harvard policies are good with regard to gun control,” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said, “I think where Harvard falls short is that students don’t know what the policies are even though they’re publicized.”
The focus group made five broad recommendations in the memo, ranging from banning firearms on all college campuses to mandating that universities regularly perform drills to prepare for emergencies.
The report, which has not been put before the UC for endorsement, also referenced two recent gun-related incidents at Harvard—the 2010 suicide on the steps of Memorial Church and the 2009 shooting in Kirkland House.
The document, along with other memos drafted by members of student governments at 15 colleges throughout the U.S., was sent to National Campus Leadership Council, an organization of more than 275 college student governments. The NCLC then compiled them into a brief, which was submitted to Vice President Joe Biden’s office in advance of President Barack Obama’s Jan. 16 announcement on gun control measures.
“It was really great to see the Council so engaged in this topic even during winter break.” Raghuveer said.
Sietse K. Goffard ’15, a UC representative for Currier House, said he volunteered to contribute to the memo because of his personal concern over gun violence in light of the recent shooting in Newtown, Conn.
“I know we have a relatively safe campus, but the thought of [the shooting] happening on our campus or anywhere else was something that really sent shivers down my spine,” he said.
Members of the focus group said that what surprised them most was the lack of clarity surrounding gun policies and prevention procedures at Harvard.
Raghuveer said that although all students receive the University’s gun policy through A Guide to the First Year at Harvard and the Handbook for Students, a recent UC survey revealed that many students were unclear about the official policy of the College.
Members of the focus group said that they were committed to working with the administration and other student groups to address the recommendations in the report, especially in improving student access to mental health resources.
“Mental health is going to be a huge focus of the Undergraduate Council in the next year,” Raghuveer said.

Sundance Film Festival recognized the artistic achievements of several Harvard filmmakers at this year’s festival. The group of filmmakers spans several generations of involvement with Harvard’s Visual and Environmental Studies Department, and many say their VES experience contributed to their success.
Michael Almereyda—a director who previously served as a visiting VES lecturer—won The Short Film Jury Award in non-fiction for “Skinningrove,” his profile of photographer and Harvard VES professor Chris Killip.
Roberto “Pacho” F. Velez ’02-03, one of two VES teaching assistants who helped with the film’s production, said the opportunities given to fledgling filmmakers at VES, and Harvard more broadly, help to shape world-class talent.
"Harvard has the best everything—the best biologists, the best philosophers,” said Velez. "They also have some of the best filmmakers and film teachers.”In Almereyda’s film, Killip discusses his photos chronicling the lives of people who live in a remote English fishing village.
“I’ve never known what to do with [the photographs],” said Killip, who added that few of the photos had been published prior to the film. “Now, they’ve ended up with a different life as a film.”
The documentary “Pussy Riot: A Punk Prayer,” directed by Mike Lerner and GSAS graduate and research fellow Maxim Pozdorovkin, also won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Punk Spirit at Sundance. The film chronicles the legal trial of the punk band Pussy Riot, whose members were arrested last year after storming a Russian cathedral and performing their religious protest song “A Punk Prayer.”
According to Pozdorovkin, the movie deals with the unique “feminist revolution” encouraged by Pussy Riot through a melding of political activism and contemporary music.
In the short film genre, VES graduate Damien S. Chazelle ’07 won The Short Film Jury Award in U.S. fiction for “Whiplash,” which tells the story of a drummer who aspires to rise through the ranks at a top conservatory’s jazz orchestra.
The film’s production brought together several generations of VES affiliates. Chazelle credits his experiences at VES with preparing him for an artistic career.
“I had a fantastic experience with VES,” said Chazelle, who plans to turn the short into a feature-length film in the future. “It defined who I am as a filmmaker now.”
VES alumnus Andrew J. Bujalski ’98 won this year’s Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film prize for “Computer Chess,” a black-and-white comedy about the relationships formed among the competitors at a 1980s computer chess tournament.

Delivering the keynote speech at a symposium Friday on the future of computation, hedge fund founder and scientist David E. Shaw predicted that researchers will increasingly rely on high-speed simulation to probe biological questions.
“One of the key questions is... how does simulation actually fit into the role of the scientific method?” Shaw asked a packed audience in Maxwell Dworkin.
“I think we are going to get to the point where people see [biomolecular simulations] as a piece of evidence in the same way that they do experiments,” he concluded later in his talk.
Shaw, who founded the D. E. Shaw Group in 1988 and now serves as chief scientist at D. E. Shaw Research, also called for a more prominent role for computers in confirming existing theories and opening up new hypotheses in biology.
He highlighted three applications of high-speed biological computing, including studying proteins and identifying appropriate pharmaceuticals for particular cases.
To illustrate the progress that has already been made, Shaw presented a high-speed supercomputer called Anton specifically designed by his research group for a class of problems called molecular dynamics simulations.
His research group has used Anton to stage simulations that have resulted in new insights into the protein folding process.
“We don’t know enough at this point to know what the limitations are,” Shaw said. “I think we have to convince ourselves.”
Nilesh Tripuraneni ’13, a physics concentrator who attended Shaw’s talk, said he had heard of Shaw’s hedge fund but was not as familiar with his current work in scientific computation.
“I know a lot of fundamental research that people do, but I’m not as knowledgeable about these applications of high-power computing,” Tripuraneni said. “I thought it was amazing that they were able to reproduce a lot of results about protein folding through their simulations.”
Shaw’s address was followed by six other presentations about the ways computing can be used to advance neuroscience, chip design, urban planning, and other disciplines. Steven E. Koonin, director of New York University’s Center for Urban Science and Progress, presented a vision of using real-time data sensors to inform decisions made by city officials about traffic flow, public health, and infrastructure planning.
“We’re getting very good at sensing, transmitting, storing, analyzing enormous amounts of data,” Koonin said. “Big data can be brought to bear on societal problems.”
Friday’s symposium capped off a series of Wintersession offerings—including a student computational challenge—organized by the Institute for Applied Computational Science.
Efthimios Kaxiras, professor of pure and applied physics and director of the Institute, said he hoped the events would educate and connect students and faculty.
“All of this is to foster a computational culture and community here at Harvard,” he said.

Harvard scored one goal in the first three minutes of the night, but nothing after. Stunned by a two-goal outburst in a matter of nine seconds near the end of the second period, the Crimson could not recover in the third, falling 5-1 Friday night to ECAC rival Clarkson (5-12-6, 4-5-2 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Center.
The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-11-1, 3-10-0 ECAC) dropped its fifth straight, cementing its place at the bottom of the standings with six points in ECAC play. In this five game span the Crimson has not scored a power-play goal, going zero for 20 in the process.
“Ultimately I think we have to be able to be more productive on the power play,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The power play to me cost us an opportunity to get two points tonight.”
Sophomore forward Joe Zarbo recorded a hat trick for the Knights, netting the go-ahead goal in the second period to make it 2-1 as well as an empty netter to clinch the victory.
Freshman Jimmy Vesey had the lone goal for the home team, scoring off a pass from sophomore Colin Blackwell just 2:34 into the first.
The Crimson started off well, with controlling play in the first 10 minutes, but could not muster much else for the rest of the night as the visitors netted five unanswered goals including three in the third to finish the game.
Junior Raphael Girard had 34 saves for Harvard in the loss, while the Crimson finished zero for six on the power play in the first home game of 2013.
“I think we’ve had trouble winning face-offs [on the power play] in their end which is huge for getting puck possession right off the bat and getting them on their heels,” Vesey said. “We haven’t won draws and [been able to] put a few passes together in a row to get them running around so we can open up a nice play.”
With his goal, Vesey continued his campaign for rookie of the year, having now tallied eight goals and four assists, leading the team and ECAC freshman in points and goals. Fellow freshman Brian Hart is not far behind with four goals and nine points, tied for second in the league in freshman scoring.
“I think we’ve had some chemistry and played well together,” Vesey said. “But I think that is a little overshadowed by the struggles we’ve had as a team; I’d trade us leading rookies in scoring any day.”
Circling around from behind the net on the left side, Blackwell had the puck poked away from him, but it found Vesey near the Clarkson net on the left side, who put the puck past Knight goalie Greg Lewis. Hart was also credited with an assist.
Harvard displayed solid offensive play in the first few minutes of the game, leading 9-2 in shots at one point, but Clarkson countered soon after killing the Crimson's lone power-play opportunity in period. The Knights ended the first period with 20 shots to Harvard's 14.
The second period looked to be an uneventful one, until Clarkson’s rapid offensive burst in the closing minutes.
For nearly 18 minutes, the two squads held each other to no goals highlighted by an impressive save by Girard. Knight junior forward Jarret Burton fired a shot that looked to trickle past Girard before the junior swept it away with his stick right before it crossed the goal line.
Clarkson was able to kill three Crimson power plays in the second period as well, including a four-on-three opportunity.
The Knights finally took advantage of a power-play chance of their own, knotting the score at one at 17:41 in the second.
Burton won the faceoff against senior Alex Fallstrom, and sent the puck to defenseman Andrew Himelson. The senior then fired a slap shot from the left point through traffic, which was ultimately deflected by Burton into the top left corner of the Harvard net.
Nine seconds later, Clarkson took the lead with another goal. Zarbo skated across the blue line on the left and sent a wrist shot through the Crimson defense and the five-hole of Girard to make it 2-1 Knights entering the final frame.
“The second one hurt I think because we were just coming off the first one and I wouldn’t call that necessarily a great scoring chance,” Donato said. “We’d probably like that one back from a goaltending perspective.”
Zarbo continued the scoring in the third period with his second of the night, burying a rebound off a shot from defenseman Paul Geiger from the middle of the blue line. Joe’s brother Matt also was credited with an assist.
Adam Pawlick added another goal for the Knights before Zarbo made it 5-1 with his empty-net goal.
“We have to do things in the offensive zone to take some pressure off the defense and goaltending,” Donato said. “That to me is more the solution for us – to become more dangerous both on the power play and five-on-five.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It started out as a game co-captain Christian Webster would rather not remember.
Through the first 38 minutes of Saturdays’ contest between the Harvard men’s basketball team and Dartmouth, the senior was shooting one of six from beyond the arc.
That’s when things turned around—in a big way.
Webster nailed three three-pointers in the final 93 seconds of regulation, leading the Crimson back from a late 10-point deficit to force overtime. Webster tacked on an assist, block, and rebound in the extra period, and Harvard pulled out an 82-77 victory.
“I’m at a loss for words right now,” Webster said after the game.
With the Crimson trailing by 10, 57-47, and 1:42 remaining, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker drew up a play for Webster coming out of a timeout.
After sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi set a screen for freshman point guard Siyani Chambers at the top of the key, Webster’s defender left him to defend Moundou-Missi as he rolled to the basket. Chambers found Webster open on the wing, and the senior drilled the triple.
Amaker called Webster’s number again with the Crimson trailing by six with 47 ticks left. This time, Webster received an off-ball screen from junior co-captain Laurent Rivard as he cut to the top of the key and received a pass from sophomore Wesley Saunders. With a hand in his face, Webster drilled the three to pull the Crimson within three.
On its next possession, Harvard ran the same play, and Webster again came through.
“We executed brilliantly,” Amaker said. “I thought Siyani and Wesley did a great job of executing the passes and the plays to get Christian the ball. And Laurent made an incredible screen to get Christian open. And obviously all those things have to happen and then Christian’s got to make a shot and he did.”
Saturday’s contest was not the first time that Webster came up in the clutch for the Crimson.
As a rookie, Webster drilled an and-one three-pointer with 12 seconds remaining to pull the Crimson within one of Princeton. (Harvard ended up falling by three after then-senior Jeremy Lin ’10 missed a contested three-pointer at the end of regulation).
As a sophomore, Webster played a critical role in the Crimson’s 24-point comeback against Brown at Lavietes Pavilion. After opening the game 0 for 8 from the field, Webster scored 18 points in the final 15:50, shooting four of four from beyond the arc. Webster’s final triple gave the Crimson a 68-66 advantage with 7:40 remaining, and Harvard led the rest of the way.
TRAVIS
Harvard’s offensive numbers at halftime were atrocious.
The Crimson was shooting 7 of 21 from the field, had turned it over 12 times, and had scored just 20 points—its second lowest first-half output of the season.
“I thought they played terrific defense on our whole team,” Amaker said. “I know we missed a lot of shots. A lot of that obviously is a credit to how they played us. The shots weren’t easy for us.”
Saunders, Chambers, and Rivard—who entered the contest averaging 16.1, 12.7, and 11.1 points, respectively—combined for just six points on 2-of-10 shooting.
But one Harvard player managed to fill the basket. In just 12 minutes on the court, sophomore forward Jonah Travis posted 10 of the Crimson’s 20 points.
Travis added six points in the second half, but was held scoreless in the final 3:30 of regulation and in overtime.
The sophomore finished with 16 points on seven of nine shooting and added four rebounds.
Travis entered the contest averaging 8.9 points per game, fourth on the Crimson. Travis has now scored in double figures in three of Harvard’s past five games.
“I did think Jonah gave us some quality minutes,” Amaker said.
FEAR THE BIG GREEN
With the Crimson’s victory on Saturday, Harvard extended its winning streak to eight games over its travel partner.
Despite its recent success, Harvard has had a tough time handling Dartmouth. Just two weeks ago in Hanover, N.H., the Crimson trailed late in the second half before making a late run to take a 10-point win.
A year ago, Harvard led the Big Green by just one at halftime in Cambridge before closing the contest on a 40-25 run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traveling halfway across the country for the ITA Kick-Off, the Harvard men’s tennis team split its matches on the weekend in Norman, Okla.
All four teams participating—the Crimson, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis—were among the top 32 teams in the nation.
“Our weekend was terrific,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We came out a little bit banged up, which is not anything a coach gets wildly excited about, but we competed really hard and had some really good performances.”
The No. 28 Crimson opened up against the No. 30 Fighting Irish (3-2), and rode consistent production in both singles and doubles to a 4-3 victory.
But despite the close win against an evenly matched opponent, Harvard ended its weekend on a sour note, falling to No. 8 Oklahoma without taking a match.
“Overall, it was really good play, but [the Sooners were] just better,” Fish said. “They deserve to go to the national indoor team championships two weeks from now in Washington.”
OKLAHOMA 4, HARVARD 0
After taking down Notre Dame the day prior, Harvard  was easily beaten by Oklahoma, 4-0, Sunday afternoon.
“This team was definitely a cut higher than [the Fighting Irish],” Fish said. “It was fun—I was watching our guys grow in front of my eyes. They were getting some balls that we weren’t used to seeing, and we would get beaten the first time, and then the second time we’d adjust.”
The Sooners sealed their spot in the Round of 16 in the ITA Championships when Guillermo Alcorta posted a 6-4, 6-3 singles victory over sophomore Alex Steinroeder in the No. 2 match, giving Oklahoma the clinching fourth point to complete the shutout.
Already down by one after a forfeit due to injury, the Crimson lost another singles point when freshman Kelvin Lam lost in two straight sets, 2-6, 0-6.
“Kelvin played some tough people, so he was a little overmatched,” Fish said. “And [sophomore] Shaun Chaudhuri and Alex Steinroeder played one and two with [sophomore] Denis Nguyen out of the lineup, and they played great tennis.”
Chaudhuri and freshmen Nicky Hu and Conor Haughey began their singles matches but neither finished once the Sooners gained their fourth points to seal their victory.
In doubles play, the Oklahoma duo of Costin Paval and Dane Webb opened up the day with an 8-4 win over Chaudhuri and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster. Freshman Nicholas Mahlangu and Steinroeder also tasted defeat at the hands of Peerakit Siributwong and Leonard Stakhovsky, dropping the match, 8-5.
HARVARD 4, NOTRE DAME 3
Harvard and Notre Dame first met in early November, when the Fighting Irish convincingly defeated the Crimson, 7-0. But Harvard stayed competitive throughout in the teams’ second meeting this season, as Harvard battled its way to a 4-3 victory.
“We got smoked [last time],” Mahlangu said. “But we all came out [Saturday] with an unquenchable fire; we all wanted to win. And I think that’s what really just kept everyone going.”
In its first dual match of the season, the Crimson received strong production from both Mahlangu and Steinroeder, who paired to play doubles and dominate their opponents en route to an 8-0 victory.
“We play a lot of doubles in practice, so I feel like we were all pretty prepared for the matches,” Mahlangu said. “Alex always comes out with a lot of energy, so I just always try to match him.”
On the singles side, Mahlangu continued his solid play by defeating Wyatt McCoy at the No. 5 position. In what was the last match to finish, Mahlangu dropped the first set but rallied to win his final two sets, the second coming in a tiebreak.
Steinroeder racked up his second victory of the day in the No. 2 singles spot, soundly defeating Blas Moros by a score of 6-4, 6-3.
MacMaster also claimed a singles victory, winning in straight sets at the No. 4 position.
With Nguyen injured, Chaudhuri played at the No. 1 singles spot and lost to Greg Andrews, the reigning Big East Player of the Year, in three sets. Hu and Lam both suffered straight set defeats.
“We came out with a lot of energy,” Mahlangu said. “We got the doubles points right away, and everyone was pretty fired up because it was the first dual match of the season. We didn’t let down, we kept fighting the entire time, and we ended up winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team improved to a perfect 6-0 in dual meets on the season after picking up wins against Notre Dame and Towson this weekend. The Crimson faced one of its toughest tests of the season, going up against the No. 20 Fighting Irish squad.
“It was great to swim against some very good competition and come away with a win,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “It really excited us and motivated us to see how fast we can go for the rest of the season.”
Harvard steadily handled both non-conference opponents, topping Notre Dame with a 264-100 victory and taking down the Tigers with a 314-52 win.
“[The meet] was a great opportunity to prove ourselves,” sophomore Chuck Katis said. “To beat [the Irish] on both days was great for us. Being a top-20 team is one of our goals this season. Our success at this meet really reinforced that goal. It was a milestone for us to be able to compete at that level.”
In the team’s first swim of the night, the 400 medley relay squad of Jack Pretto, Katis, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite set a pool record with a time of 3:17.66, beating the rest of the competition by over two seconds. The Crimson picked up a bronze in the event as well, as Kyle McIntee, Owen Wurzbacher, Jacob Luna, and Will Brophy teamed for a time of 3:20.44 to finish in third.
“Both days, the team was very excited to swim fast and very excited to race against a really great Notre Dame team,” Roop said. “[Winning the opening relay] really got people excited, and we really never look back from there.”
Led by some breakout swims from its freshman class, Harvard came away with victories in 16 of the meet’s 19 events.
Rookie Christian Yeager won the 200 backstroke in a time of 1:48.28, with classmate Tyler Rocca closely behind. Rocca touched the wall shortly after Yeager, and the Crimson duo finished almost a full four seconds ahead of the next closest competitor.
Rocca went on to later win the 100 backstroke in a time of 50.78. Harvard swept the podium in the event, as freshman Jacob Luna finished second and junior Jack Pretto rounded out the top-three.
First-year Christian Carbone set a pool record in the 400 IM. His time of 3:52.34, over four seconds better than the second place finisher, was a personal best and good for an NCAA ‘B’ standard time. Carbone also picked up a win in the 200 butterfly with a time of 1:48.29.
“We had a lot of great swims this weekend,” Katis said. “A lot of the freshmen really stepped up. I think every freshman had at least one or two great swims. I think across the board we had a lot of people step into the shoes they really needed to fill.”
Katis failed to win the 100 breast for the first time this season, but the sophomore’s second-place time of 54.73 was still good enough for an NCAA ‘B’ standard.
“I think everyone on the team is at different points rest-wise,” Katis said. “In my case, given the amount of work I’ve been doing, my times this weekend were some of the best I’ve had unrested, which was a great sign.”
In one of the most dominant events of the meet, the Crimson swept the top five spots in the 200 freestyle. Satterthwaite led the charge with a time of 1:40.05, edging out sophomore Zachary Walters for the top spot by .19 seconds. Roop came in third with a time of 1:40.29, while sophomores Kyle McIntee and Griffin Schumacher rounded out the top five.
The meet served as good preparation for the back end of Harvard’s conference schedule. The Crimson will face off this coming weekend against Yale and Princeton, and will face similarly stiff competition in the No. 23 Tigers.
“I think this sets the tone for this weekend,” Katis said. “We are all very excited to go compete in Princeton’s home pool. I think we’re going to go in with a great win this [past] weekend behind [us].”
But even with a tough Ivy League test at the front of its mind, Harvard also has its eyes set of greater success down the road at the Ivy and ECAC Championships.
“It’s very encouraging to see people swim as fast as they did this weekend as we go into the final end of our season,” Roop said. “It’s really motivating to know that, physically, we are ready to swim fast. And if we approach the rest of the season with the proper attitude, then I think a lot of really good things will happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christian Webster’s group of treys down the stretch that helped the Harvard men’s basketball team pull off a comeback overtime victory against Dartmouth garnered the co-captain top honors this week, but The Back Page would like to recognize other Crimson athletes who posted similarly impressive showings over the last week.
Freshman Christian Carbone, Men’s Swimming
Swimming against Notre Dame and Townson at the Shamrock Invitational this weekend, the freshman broke two records at the Rolfs Aquatic Center. Carbone set a new pool record in the 400 IM, touching the final wall in 3:52:34, shattering his personal best by more than four seconds. He set another personal record in the 200 fly, an event that Harvard swept en route to its sixth-consecutive victory to remain unbeaten on the year.
Freshman Martina Salander, Women’s Track and Field
 
While half of her team traveled across town to BU to take on teams at the Terrier Invitational, this freshman and the remainder of the track and field team headed south to the Texas A&M Challenge, where Salander proceeded to make history. With over 4094 points in the pentathlon, Salander not only placed second at the meet, she broke a seven-year Harvard record and now holds the top Ivy League mark. At the meet, the rookie reached the podium in all five events, including a first-place finish in the shot put.
Sophomore Jonah Travis, Men’s Basketball
Although Travis didn’t score during the final three minutes of regulation or in overtime, the forward played a key role in keeping Harvard within striking distance for the first 37 minutes. While the rest of the team went 18 for 44 on the day, the sophomore netted seven of his nine attempts to score 16 points, 10 of which came in the first half. With 14 points in the pain, Travis led the offensive effort from the inside, where the Crimson outscored the Big Green, 40-34.
Junior Kalley Armstrong, Women’s Hockey
While the men’s hockey team was skating to an overtime loss against St. Lawrence at home, Armstrong was making sure that the women’s team would have a different outcome. A little over two minutes into the extra period, junior forward Lyndsey Fry recovered a rebound and powered it to Armstrong, who slid it past the Saints’ goaltender to lift Harvard to a 3-2 victory. The junior, who tallied her eighth goal against St. Lawrence, also scored the Crimson’s only goal in the loss to Clarkson on the day before.

The Harvard ski team raced to a ninth-place finish at the Colby Carnival, its third EISA competition of the season this weekend at Sugarloaf, Maine, and Waterville, Maine. The result was the second 9th-place finish in a row for the team, which competes in a field of 16.
The Crimson pulled in 268 points as a team, trailing host Colby College’s 386 points and topping St. Michael’s College’s 238 points.
The University of Vermont was the overall victor, with 962 points. Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire rounded out the top three.
Harvard saw its strongest result overall in the women’s giant slalom. Junior Rebecca Nadler clipped nearly the whole slate of skiers for second place. She posted a total time of 1:45.71 over two runs.
Her first run, at 52.50 seconds, was one of four sub-53-second finishes in the whole race.
“Conditions were extremely cold and extremely icy, so it was very, very challenging, and that suits Rebecca very well,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said. “She’s an extremely strong technical skier, and her skiing has been coming along week-by-week, getting a little bit better, a little bit better. It was encouraging not just that she finished second but [also that] she did that even with a couple of pretty good-sized mistakes.”
Battling the weather, Nadler yet again came up short against University of Vermont junior Kate Ryley, who won last year’s national title in the Slalom.
Ryley’s two runs were a combined 1.13 seconds faster than those of Nadler.
“I was definitely happy with my results,” Nadler said.
Nadler had the benefit of prior experience when she took to the slopes. “I actually skied at the hill where we raced for a year, so I had a little bit of a home-court advantage,” the Ottawa native said. “It was fun to be back, and I really like racing on that hill.”
Catherine Sheils was the next finisher for the Crimson. The senior, who has recently been battling a back injury, notched a combined finish of 1:52.32.  Sophomore Elizabeth Strong was the final Harvard racer, placing 40th.
Nadler was unable to record a high finish in the women’s Slalom event due to a major error in her second run. While a first run of 46.61 seconds placed her well within the top half of skiers, Nadler hit an edge towards the end of her second run and had to hike back up part of the mountain before finishing the course. Her time for the second run was 1:09.12, setting her back towards the end of the field. Freshman Samantha Udolf posted the top finish in the event for Harvard skiers, coming in at 44th.
“She is skiing exponentially better than she ever has at any point in time in her previous ski racing,” Mitchell said. “She’s kind of one-upping herself every single time she’s out there, and so it’s really exciting to see her on such a steep improvement curve right now.”
The Crimson also penetrated the top-ten team finishes in the two men’s cross-country events. In the 20k Freestyle MS on Sunday, Harvard’s two racers cracked the top 20 for 61 team points and a seventh place finish. Sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci finished the course in 48:12.3 for 10th place, while junior Chris Stock trailed by 42.2 seconds for 17th place.
The day before, Maifeld-Carucci posted a team-high 25th place in the 10k Classic event with a time of 27:05 ,while Stock came in just 10 seconds later for 31st place in the field of 93. The Crimson also saw finishes from senior Anthony Ryerson and freshman Soren Anderson, who were 39th and 81st, respectively.
Three freshmen on the men’s Alpine team completed tricky runs in the men’s Slalom event.
“They did phenomenally well this weekend under some extremely challenging conditions,” Mitchell said. “In the Slalom, we actually had four guys qualify for the second run and that was tremendous.”
Along with junior Ian Anderson, freshmen Matthew Mansson, Dan Rittenhouse, and Jack Stobierski all finished the event. Mansson was the team’s top finisher in 35th place with a total time of 1:32.94 over two runs. Anderson and Rittenhouse finished side by side in 43rd and 44th, respectively, while Stobierski closed the group in 46th place.
“The guys are starting to see the fruits of their labor,” Mitchell said. “They’re starting to put it together. Having four guys get into the second run, having some solid results was really encouraging under extremely difficult circumstances, so I was really happy with their performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading 17-16 against Army with two bouts remaining, the Harvard wrestling team sent its final two wrestlers to the mat.
First up was sophomore James Fox in the 197-pound weight class. Fox took on Bryce Barnes and downed him, 10-5, to give the Crimson a four-point lead. Heavyweight David Ng was up next, and with the victory on the line, he posted a 7-4 decision over Curtis Garner.
With Ng’s round done, Harvard (3-4, 1-3 EIWA) secured a 23-16 win over the Black Knights (5-6, 2-2) Sunday afternoon at Gillis Field House, its first EIWA victory.
“I thought we wrestled very well as a team in an away match against a very tough team,” Fox said. “We always know that Army’s going to be a tough match. They train incredibly hard. It’s very, very hard to break an Army kid, as they like to say, they’re really top-notch, and they always come at you. It’s what they’re trained to do.”
Freshman Jeffrey Ott began the Crimson’s bid for victory, competing against Hunter Wood in the 125-pound division. Ott finished his bout in dramatic fashion, pinning Wood down in 3:46 to launch Harvard into an early 6-0 lead.
Trying to break the 6-6 score after sophomore Ryan Osleeb lost his bout, the Crimson pitted co-captain Steven Keith, ranked 13th in the 141-pound category, against Army counterpart Tyler Rauenzahn. Keith scored four more bonus points with a major decision victory, shutting out Rauenzahn, 9-0, registering his 96th career victory.
Rookie Todd Preston won his match in the 149-pound bout, giving Harvard a 13-6 lead. The victory was the freshman’s third on the season.
“I thought Todd Preston wrestled a great match at 149,” coach Jay Weiss said. “He’s just starting to get into his own in his first semester, he’s really starting to wrestle well.”
Co-captain Walter Peppelman, the eighth-ranked wrestler in his weight class, registered a major decision against Brian Harvey, giving the Crimson a commanding nine-point lead.
“Walter also had a really tough match, and he was battling a couple of injuries,” Fox said. “He’s a really tough kid and got bonus points for us, while Steven Keith, who we expect big things from, was solid in his whole match, pulling off bonus points [as well]. Those little bonus points as the match goes on really helped us get the W’s tonight.”
But back-to-back losses in the 174-pound and 184-pound classes by junior Cameron Croy and sophomore Josh Popple, respectively, brought the Black Knights within one again, setting the stage for Fox and Ng to bring home the win for the Crimson.
“It was pretty close at the end, but we were able to get the W at the end,” Fox said. “Ng, our heavyweight, just did a great job at the end, coming back from behind and getting a big win to seal the deal.”
Coming into the match, Harvard was looking to break a two-match losing streak but maintained confidence despite the record.
“We were fully expecting to go in and win this match,” Fox said. “We knew this was a match we were fully capable of winning. Obviously, we knew they were going to be very tough, they don’t stop coming at you, they wrestle hard for seven minutes. So we had to wrestle solid, but we expected the win, we wrestled for the win and fortunately the results reflected that.”
With six out of 10 victories, Fox felt that the team pulled off all of the goals put forth in practice in the previous week.
“We have been very solid—all week, we focused on different positions, and we had specific goals going into the match,” Fox said. “Staying inside control, being tough on defense, certain breakdowns, good returns—we had these little goals that we wanted to wrestle in certain positions, and I think we did a good job of accomplishing those goals overall across the board, and those were the main reasons we were able to pull out the W today.”
The Crimson is now off for two weeks before taking on Penn and Princeton, a break that Weiss is hoping to use to boost the team’s competition level.
“I feel that we are going into a bit of an off-weekend, so I wanted to work on training pretty hard the last couple weeks,” Weiss said. “I’m looking forward to seeing how we compete, and that kind of dictates how we do from here on out. So I thought the guys responded, I thought they wrestled well. [Army] threw a lot of things at our game plan. I thought they stuck to it, and it worked.”

After weeks away for winter break, students trickled back to find warm solace and excitement amidst the frigid weather in Cambridge: new restaurants in Harvard Square! Among them was OSUSHI, a modern Japanese restaurant serving everything from tempura and sushi rolls to the small bites typically served at an Izakaya. OSUSHI, which opened in mid-December, also has a sister establishment at in Boston.
From its expansive menu, the Ramen ($14) and Gomoku Chirashi ($15) offered a balance between warm and cold. The pork broth ramen, topped with pickled daikon, seaweed, boiled egg, and sesame seeds, had two choices of topping: pork belly or mentaiko, also known as marinated pollack roe. The broth of the ramen had coagulated pork fat floating on the surface, which had to be scooped out with a spoon. The noodle was slightly overcooked; instead of being chewy, it melted and disappeared in the mouth. The salty, fishy flavor of the mentaiko was a bit overpowering and did not balance well with the rich pork broth.
The bowl of Gomoku Chirashi contained an assortment of diced pieces of seafood such as tuna, hamachi, saba, and shrimp, as well as tamago (egg), salmon roe, and cucumber over a bed of seasoned sushi rice. It was difficult to taste the texture and freshness of the fish from the finely chopped sashimi, which should have been more thickly cut. Also, the ratio between toppings and rice was a bit skewed.
Although the dining experience at OSUSHI was not stupendous, perhaps a visit to its Copley location will change this reviewer's mind.

You've probably heard about most of these classes by now, but chances are you couldn't personally make it to each. Have no fear—we at Flyby made the rounds on this hectic first day of Shopping Week. We're here to give you details from some of Monday's most crowded lecture halls. So much for Pre-Term Planning!
United States in the World 26: "Sex and the Citizen: Race, Gender, and Belonging in the United States"
This Gen Ed may have had up to 200 students attend the first lecture, according to Caroline Light, who teaches the course and is also the director of studies for Women, Gender, and Sexuality.
Many students could not fit into the classroom, and after class all 200 syllabi had been picked up, despite the fact that Pre-Term Planning data had indicated that around 140 were interested in the course, Light said. Light doesn't plan to lottery the course, so all interested students should be able to enroll.
History of Science 125: "'Moneyball' Nation: Science and the Making of Modern America"
Adam M. Butensky '13 is a pre-med student and club baseball player. He said his interests found their match with this course, which explores how mathematical models have been used to make decisions and evaluations—such as in baseball.
Butensky was impressed by the first lecture, which he said had too many students to sit in chairs. He estimated that about 100 students had come to the first lecture of the course.
Government 10: "Foundations of Political Theory"
Eric Beerbohm, Frederick S. Danziger Associate Professor of Government and of Social Studies, estimated that his introductory government class had about 120 attendees at the first lecture. Last spring, only 23 students took the course.
Beerbohm, who has taught the course for four years now, will not be teaching it next spring, as he will be on sabbatical. He speculated that the high interest in the class Monday might be a result of students becoming more interested in political theory because of the current American political climate.
English 170a: "High and Low in Postwar America"
English professor Louis Menand's course on fictional literature is new this year, and its debut was marked with a full classroom—and interested students spilling into the hallway. Pre-Term Planning data had suggested that about 35 students were interested in taking the course, Menand said, but over 100 showed up on Monday.
