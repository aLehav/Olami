After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chances are you don't always stop and examine the many outdoor works of art we have around Harvard. But the next time you’re trying to end an awkward walk-and-talk with an acquaintance, try heading off in the direction of these outdoor sculptures.
Harvard Bixi (Widener) 
This 27-ton marble stele adjacent to Widener Library dates back to imperial China, when it was kept in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing. Alumni involved in Harvard Clubs in China acquired the original stele in 1936 and donated it to the University in honor of the Tercentennial Ceremony. The new inscription translates to a commendation of the Harvard community and its contributions and celebrates the effects of higher education. So you might want to stop sitting on it.
"Four Piece Reclining Figure" (Lamont)
The abstract work by British sculptor Henry Moore was donated to the University in 1981 by David Bakalar ’46. When asked about his particular style of titles, Moore said that he'd rather have the viewer interpret what they’ve seen rather than be told what they’ve seen. So do Moore proud and take another look the next time you stumble dazedly out of a study session in Lamont.
Civil War Memorial (Cambridge Common) 
Since it's probably a better idea to walk through Cambridge Common in the daylight, you might as well take a look at this almost 150-year-old stone shrine. Atop the dome is a stone statue of a Civil War soldier; below, a bronze sculpture of President Lincoln. Bronze plaques on the memorial name men from Cambridge who died in the Civil War.
Tanner Fountain (Science Center) 
The Tanner fountain is more dynamic than it seems, changing its appearance with the light and emitting steam from the Science Centre’s heating plant in the winter. The fountain, designed by Californian Peter Walker and completed in 1984, has won awards for its innovative basin-less structure.
John Harvard Statue
Not actually John Harvard. Foot is pale yellow for a reason. Reminder that many of you have urinated on an 128-year-old work of art.
"Onion" (Pusey Library) 
Perched quietly and unassumingly at the now-closed entrance to Pusey Library, "Onion" is a wrought-iron stabile made by American sculptor Alexander Calder, known as the originator of the artistic mobile. Unfortunately, "Onion" is often mistaken for a leftover construction component next to the ever-darkened door to Pusey.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's fun to show people this song and then dare them to guess who sings it. The look that typically crosses a person's face when they're informed that this touching tune about the pain of ending a relationship comes to them courtesy of Ke$ha doesn't get old.
It turns out that Ke$ha is not the only billboard darling with some seriously non-pop skeletons in her closet. That Katy Perry is the daughter of evangelical pastors is relatively well known, but even those aware of her Christian roots are probably unaware of her Christian rock album. Before Perry broke onto the pop scene by declaring that she'd "Kissed a Girl"(and liked it!), the woman then known as Katy Hudson tried her hand at religious pop, releasing a self-titled CD that sold roughly 100 copies.
And contrary to popular belief, Lady Gaga did not emerge from the womb fully masked and meat-dressed. When this video was recorded, Gaga still went by Stefani Germanotta, and was writing songs a little less, let's say, sensational, than hits like "Monster" and "Edge of Glory."

Benjamin L. DeVore ’15 wants to donate blood. He is young, healthy, and with a recent nationwide drop in donations, his blood could save lives. There’s only one problem: He is a gay man.
Since 1986, the Federal Drug Administration has required all blood donor applications to ask a potential male donor if he has had sex with a man one or more times since 1977. If the box is checked, the volunteer is turned away.
“It’s very disheartening to see a sign like ‘Blood Drive next Thursday,’ and know that you can’t contribute,” DeVore says. “Especially when you know you’re not HIV-positive.”
In 1983, with the AIDS epidemic intensifying, the FDA began to issue guidelines regarding donations by those at increased risk for HIV. Initially, this was limited to men with multiple male sexual partners or who had clear signs of immune deficiency. But the current stricter law has been in effect for almost 30 years.
DeVore, political co-chair of Harvard’s Queer Students and Allies, is one of a number of students currently lobbying to lift the ban.
Earlier in the semester, DeVore was approached by Corinne H. Curcie ’15, president of the Harvard Libertarian Forum, about possible activism efforts against the regulation. “We talk about government regulation [in the club],” Curcie says, “and this is a form of collectivism that really makes us angry.”
From a libertarian perspective, she says, the ban is a regulation that is both inconsistent and discriminatory. “If a woman has had a lot of unsafe sex, has multiple sexual partners,” Curcie adds, “[the regulation] doesn’t take that into account.”
To Curcie, partnership with the QSA seemed a natural next step. The Libertarian Forum, though coming at the issue from a regulatory standpoint, was able to find common ground with QSA’s emphasis on civil rights and queer discrimination. “There’s a large amount of scientific and medical evidence that this ban is outdated, inefficient—that it needs to be changed,” says Devore.
Since 2002, advances in testing technology have significantly reduced the risk of HIV transmission through blood donations: Sources peg the current risk at one unit in one to two million donations. But given the 20 million yearly donations, the FDA has continued to turn to social factors. The FDA’s website says that, since the prevalence of HIV is hundreds of times higher among men who have had sex with men, the policy is no more than a matter of statistics.
But, over the past decade, other groups have begun to challenge that assessment. Since 2006, the Red Cross has voiced its support to lift the FDA ban. America’s Blood Centers, a non-profit network of blood centers, and the American Association of Blood Banks have joined in the conversation, claiming that there is simply not enough medical proof to continue justifying the policy. In June, Massachusetts senator John Kerry and Illinois representative Mike Quigley, along with 64 other lawmakers, sent a letter of protest to the Department of Health and Human Services. “This is a matter of life and death,” Quigley told CNN at the time, “and we are turning away over 50,000 healthy men who want to donate blood.”
I. Glenn Cohen, Co-Director of the Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, suggests that the ban could be challenged in courts on the basis of unconstitutionality. The most likely scenario would be “a claim that the ban discriminates in a way that violates the Equal Protection clause,” he writes in an email. Cohen could not be reached over the phone because he was abroad.
“If the blood donation ban is reviewed under ‘pure rational basis’ review,” he continues, “the government’s ban will very likely survive.” On the other hand, “if gays are treated as ‘suspect or quasi-suspect class’…given the scientific evidence FDA may have a hard time claiming that it can satisfy that standard.”
Countries like Australia, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have all loosened their regulations on blood donations by gay men in recent decades. Curcie and DeVore see their efforts as attempts to reach these standards, beginning with a one-year, rather than lifetime, deferral on blood donations from men who have had sex with men. For them, though, a merely medical discourse is not enough; personal and ethical factors play just as large a role.
“[The law] doesn’t take into account many cases,” says DeVore. “For instance, a male who is in a monogamous relationship—that might be the only sexual relationship he’s ever had.”
“The law needs to be more nuanced,” he concludes. “A lot of men who have sex with men really want to contribute, and a lot of these men are not at high-risk.”
On Friday, the Libertarian Forum and QSA began a dining-hall campaign of letter-writing to be sent to the FDA. Three hundred and seventy-eight letters were logged the first night of the campaign. With each signature on a letter packaged in its own envelope, the organizations’ leaders hope that their efforts will make a profound impact at the FDA. An additional goal, though, is to raise awareness about the ban among the Harvard student community.
“A lot of people might have some idea about the policy,” says Curcie, “but what they don’t realize is that it’s a federal regulation”—one with which the Red Cross, for example, no longer agrees.
For Curcie, the policy is more sinister than many realize. “It’s telling a group of people that you can’t be life-savers because you’re somehow tainted,” she says. “It labels an entire group of people as somehow being less.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first game of the season for both Harvard and MIT men’s basketball, each squad showed the rust of a long off-season early in the night. Eventually the Crimson pulled out the win, 69-54, but not before an abundance of turnovers and a series of runs characterized the first period for both teams as inconsistent.
Harvard’s opening four possessions all resulted in turnovers, while the Engineers lost possession of the ball on their first two times down the court. While MIT’s initial two turnovers were forced, the Crimson’s were not. The first Harvard mistake came on an attempted post-entry pass from the top of the key to the left block, but the ball missed its target, ending up out of bounds. The next turnover came on a fumble in the lane, followed by an intercepted pass and one more lost ball.
Harvard scored its first a little over five minutes into the contest, thanks to two free throws from co-captain Christian Webster. This lack of early offense led the Engineers to take an early lead, 10-2.
But with Webster’s shots from the charity stripe, the momentum seemed to flip, and the Crimson quickly went on a 20-2 run in the next 8:28, earning and extending the lead to 20-12.
“Things change when you can get the ball to go in the basket a few times,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You feel much better about yourselves. [We] took care of it, and I thought those runs were indicative of what is probably going to happen in the game of basketball. Tonight we were the beneficiary of it at the right time. ”
Harvard only turned the ball over five more times throughout the rest of the game, tallying nine on the night, whereas MIT amassed 18 in total.
BLOCK PARTY
After only recording three blocks in the 2011-12 season, sophomore Kenyatta Smith recorded five Friday night, one for about every four minutes that he was on the court. Despite his active play, Smith managed to only pick up one personal foul in the entirety of the game.
The sophomore’s initial two blocks were close to identical. The first came with 6:54 remaining in the opening half when the Engineers’ Mitchell Kates drove from the right wing to the basket, and attempted to lay it up from five feet out. Smith swatted the ball out of the air and out of bounds—almost exactly where his next block would end up, 85 seconds later, when Kates tried the same shot once more.
“We were just trying to do the same thing we do every game,” sophomore Wesley Saunders said. “Just contain them.”
Smith’s aggression was matched by classmate Jonah Travis. Travis recorded three blocks for the game, good for 43 percent of his total from last year. Fellow sophomores Steve Moundou-Missi and Saunders, as well as junior co-captain Laurent Rivard, each added one to the Crimson total, pushing it to 10 on the night.
The Crimson’s 10 blocks were only two shy of the team record of 12, which was set in 2008 against Army.  Smith’s five stuffs were just two short of the all-time high for a player in a single game—the record belongs to Brian Banks ’78, who nabbed seven blocks in a match-up against Detroit in 1977.
But Amaker saw the abundance of blocks as a stat that pointed to Harvard’s inconsistent defense at the top of the shot clock.
“I think sometimes blocking shots can be misleading,” Amaker said. “[It] can make it seem like that player is playing great defense, which is not always true…. [Smith] blocked some shots…which is great and we’ll take it, but we’d rather be in a position where we don’t have to come up with the blocks, because sometimes we’re making the blocks because we’re out of position to start.”
NEW LOOK UP TOP
In the first collegiate game of his career, freshman Siyani Chambers was consistent across the board, racking up nine points, three assists, one rebound, and one steal, in 36 minutes of playing time. The point guard went 2-for-2 from beyond the arc, with neither shot touching the rim.
After a shaky start that included a turnover and three missed shots in the first seven minutes, Chambers rebounded and finished the game by sinking three out of his next four shots.
“I love [Chambers],” Amaker said. “He’s going to get better, you can see the speed and quickness. I was disappointed that we weren’t able to finish some things that he kind of served up to our guys, which would have made his stats, his play look even better. But I was very pleased…. We get [the ball] in his hands up the floor, good things usually happen.”
On defense, Chambers had one of the toughest assignments of the night in covering MIT senior Mitchell Kates. Though Kates, a selection on last year’s NEWMAC All-Conference First Team, put up 20 points, his efficiency was lower than usual, shooting just 6-for-16 from the field. Kates turned the ball over four times as well, a number higher than his 2.9 turnover-per-game average last season. Chambers and Kates faced off for all but four minutes of game play.
“I think Harvard got a tremendous point guard in the freshman Chambers,” Engineers coach Larry Anderson said. “You can see he’s really, really talented. We’re fortunate enough to have a pretty good guard ourselves, and I just thought it was a good battle between those two.”
Backing up Chambers was sophomore Alex Nesbitt, a guard who totaled only three minutes of playing time in his rookie year. However, due to the graduation of Oliver McNally ’12 and the departures of Brandyn Curry and Corbin Miller, Harvard’s point guard rotation noticeably shrank this offseason, enabling Nesbitt to earn five minutes on the hardwood in Friday’s matchup.
Nesbitt collected two points on the night, coming on a right-hand layup with four seconds remaining in the game.
“I thought [Nesbitt] did a really nice job,” Amaker said. “He ran our offense, scored there late, made the right decision with the ball. I’m very pleased to see him get on the floor and perform and play the way he’s supposed to play and lead our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tough loss to Union on Friday night, the No. 13/14 Harvard men’s hockey team delivered a decisive 4-0 victory over Rensselaer on Saturday evening at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (3-2, 2-2 ECAC) snapped a two-game losing streak to take the final game of the homestand behind a freshman line that played together for the first time against the Engineers (0-4, 1-5-2).
With the loss of sophomore forward Colin Blackwell to injury, Harvard relied on freshmen Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and Brian Hart in the second line.
The Crimson’s freshman class, ranked first in the ECAC coming into the season, accounted for three of the team’s four goals.
“[Playing together] was a lot of fun,” said Hart, who netted his first goal of the season in the first period. “[Criscuolo] has been great both ways, and [Vesey] obviously has a ton of skill. Now that we are playing together, hopefully we can practice a little bit more together and build that chemistry.”
Harvard came out strong in the first period, taking 22 shots to the Engineers’ five. Just six minutes into the contest, the Crimson was on the power play, but the team failed to capitalize on that man-up opportunity—or its other five—on the night.
Thirty seconds after the first power play ended, Harvard broke the 0-0 tie. After senior center Luke Greiner won a faceoff, senior right wing Alex Fallstrom played a pass across the goal, which ricocheted off Engineer goalkeeper Bryce Merriam. As the puck bounced around in front of the goal, senior left wing Marshall Everson found net, beating Merriam for his third goal of the season.
The Crimson’s first line had the first goal, but for the rest of the night it was all about the second line.
Fourteen minutes into the period, Hart took a pass from sophomore center Ryan McGregor and passed up two Rensselaer defenders before playing it into the back of the net to give Harvard a 2-0 lead.
“[The second line] had a big game for us tonight, and hopefully we’ll continue to have different guys step up,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said after the game. “Hart’s goal was a big-time play and a great shot. He’s really played much better than his stat line.”
Vesey contributed the Crimson’s final two goals of the night, both unassisted, for his fourth and fifth scores of the season.
In the second period, Vesey forced a Rensselaer turnover, gathered the puck at center ice and broke away to take an undefended shot. On the final play of the game, Vesey blocked a shot by defenseman Craig Bokenfohr and scored Harvard’s fourth goal on an empty net to cap off a big night.
“[Besides scoring] he did a lot of other things that rounded out his game and made him more complete,” Donato said. “Even though the empty-net goal came after a blocked shot, those are the types of things that as a team we want to take pride in and celebrate.”
In the net for the Crimson, junior goalkeeper Raphael Girard made 24 saves for his second career shutout.
One of his key stops was an acrobatic block of the Engineers’ best chance of the night, a breakaway in the second period by center Mark McGowan.
Rensselaer threatened again at the end of the second frame, taking eight shots in the final two minutes, but the visitors couldn’t get one past Girard and the Harvard defense.
“I think Raph is one of our best players, and tonight we played more of a team game and were able to clear the net out for him,” Vesey said.
Girard’s Engineer counterpart Merriam dealt with more pressure throughout the night, as Harvard outshot Rensselaer 38 to 24. Merriam made 34 saves, but he could not hold off a strong Crimson offense, which won 37 of 60 faceoffs and saw six power plays to Rensselaer’s three.
After consecutive losses to Yale and Union, Harvard picked up its first home conference win of the season to bring its conference record back to .500.
“It was a big night for us because we got beat pretty bad two nights in a row, two home games in a row,” Donato said. “We couldn’t really feel proud of the way we played [Friday], so it was a real character test for us [Saturday].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last weekend of the season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (10-16, 7-7 Ivy) dropped its match at Yale (18-5, 14-0) on Friday night but rebounded with a win at Brown (7-17, 3-11) on Saturday to finish the year .500 in conference play. The Crimson ended the season fifth in the Ivy League, while the Bulldogs went unbeaten and the Bears came in seventh.
This year’s season marked Harvard’s best conference record since 2009, and the team moved up one spot in the standings from last year’s sixth-place finish.
After Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss notched her 250th career win, she hit yet another big milestone on Saturday. The win against Brown gave Weiss her 100th Ivy League win.
“It’s nice to play for someone who you trust,” said sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey. “She’s very motherly and caring, and I think that’s something that’s unique about her. We’re all very happy for her…and glad that we could be a part of it.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Leading the Bears 2-1 with a 24-21 edge in the fourth, the Crimson was poised to finish off its season with a win. But Brown did not go away without a fight.
Harvard gave up a 4-0 run, including three straight kills, and neither team could pull away and win the set easily. Finally a service error and an attack error by the Bears helped Harvard pull away to take the set and the match, 25-21, 21-25, 25-20, 29-27.
“It speaks to the dedication of our team and to the seniors for leading us through that very challenging time,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace. “It’s a very high-pressure situation.”
The Crimson and Brown split the first two sets, with Harvard dropping the second after winning the opening frame. In the third, a kill by captain outside hitter Taylor Docter gave Harvard a 4-3 lead, and the Crimson did not trail again in the set.
“We lost the second game; we didn’t play well,” Casey said. “But I think the whole time we kind of knew that we were in control and that we were going to end up winning.”
Sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters had a big game for Harvard, recording five blocks and a game-high 14 kills.
“She’s been playing amazing all season,” said Casey, who led the Crimson with 21 digs. “She’s been a huge part of our team blocking and offensively. She’s also, I think, stepped into a leadership role this season that she didn’t have last season.”
Fittingly for Harvard, the two double-doubles for the team went to seniors Docter and setter Beth Kinsella in their last games in Crimson uniforms. Docter and Kinsella registered 12 kills and 11 digs and a team-high 24 assists and 12 digs, respectively.
“Beth and Taylor have been such an important part of our team, and it’s going to be tough without them,” Casey said. “It’s a nice memory to have as their last game.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
On Friday night, the Crimson fell in straight sets to the dominant Bulldogs, 25-19, 25-10, 25-10.
Harvard battled in the first, cutting the lead to 20-18, but the Bulldogs closed the set with a 5-1 run that included two kills from sophomore outside hitter Mollie Rogers. In both the second and the third, Yale got off to quick starts from which the Crimson could never recover.
“They’re just a good team,” Casey said. “I think something that we didn’t necessarily see coming against them was how strong their block was.... It was extra hard for us to get kills against them.”
“[Their blocking] was a challenge that was a bit more difficult for us to overcome than we thought,” Wallace echoed.
That blocking helped the Bulldogs tally twice as many kills as the Crimson on the night, 48-24, despite “some pretty scrappy defensive plays” from Harvard, according to Wallace.
In the second, a 6-0 run early in the set gave the Bulldogs a 7-2 lead from which the Crimson never came back. In the third, Yale used an 8-0 run to open up a 15-4 advantage on its way to victory over Harvard.
Walters and Wallace led the Crimson with six kills apiece, while Docter led the squad with 12 digs. Kinsella tallied a team-high 13 assists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team found the back of the net early in its final game against Ivy League foe Penn, yet the initial score was not enough, as the Quakers proceeded to score three unanswered goals to top the Crimson in a battle between the bottom two teams in the Ancient Eight on Saturday in Philadelphia.
For the second year in a row, Harvard went winless in the Ivy League, finishing last in the conference.
The game got off to a promising start for the Crimson when the offense strung together a series of passes and found Zack Wolfenzon, who buried the ball inside the left post just two minutes in.
But the lead proved short-lived, as Penn responded with a goal of its own a mere 51 seconds later. Immediately following the ensuing kickoff, the Quakers worked the ball downfield to Kamar Saint-Louis, whose chip shot from 25 yards out barely evaded the hands of freshman goalie Evan Mendez.
“That goal was the turning point of the game,” sophomore forward Hiroki Kobayashi said.
The teams remained in a deadlock for rest of the first half, as Harvard controlled the shots and corner kick tally but failed to convert on its opportunities.
But Penn broke away early in the second half, scoring two goals in just over 10 minutes.
After a Quaker corner kick created commotion in the box, Travis Dolezal was able to find Sam Engs, who headed the ball into the net in the 53rd minute. Dolezal then gave the Quakers breathing room at the 64:46 mark when he finished after a run past the Crimson defense.
“[The first goal] was a bit of a shock to the system, and we didn’t really recover from that,” Harvard co-captain Richard Smith said.
The Crimson outshot Penn, 19-13, including seven shots on goal, and had eight corner kicks to the Quakers’ four, but, as was the case for much of the season, the Crimson failed to turn chances into goals.
Harvard players felt that Penn played a style very suitable for the Crimson offense, but Harvard could not convert its opportunities.
“They loved to connect passes, even from their goal kicks,” Kobayashi said. “We liked to pressure them...leading to us getting the ball in their third often.”
“Penn is an interesting team because they are good offensively, but they are susceptible defensively,” Smith added. “We just couldn’t convert.”
The loss to the Quakers ends another tough season for Harvard and marks a disappointing conclusion to the careers of four seniors—Smith, Wolfenzon, forward Brian Rogers, and co-captain Scott Prozeller—who, three seasons ago, began their times at Harvard with an Ivy League title.
“We talked before the game...about enjoying the last game we played with the [seniors],” Kobayashi said. “It sucked that we couldn’t win [for the seniors], because they are really big leaders on the team.”
On the season, the squad only won one more game than it did in the 2011 campaign, yet the general feeling around the team was one of optimism.
“If you look at it as a trajectory, last year the team was in pretty bad shape,” Smith said. “Even though the results aren’t that much better, the improvements have been there, in terms of commitment to the team and to the system.”
Though the team did not break through in the win column, the players note many positives towards the end of the season.
“We started to play better offensively,” Kobayashi said. “Defensively, we need to be able to sense dangers when they are there.”

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
Diners are invited to be chefs when they order shabu shabu, a Japanese version of hot pot, at Shabu-Ya. The entrée comes with a choice of protein, a platter of vegetables that includes lettuce, cabbage, corn, tofu, carrots, and mushroom, as well as a choice of udon noodles, clear noodles, or a bowl of rice. Diners dunk the ingredients into a boiling broth and then dip them into a special salty sauce. Shabu shabu is a fun experience if you have never tried it, but the vegetables at Shabu-Ya were not very fresh and the broth tasted bland.
In addition to shabu shabu, I tasted two other dishes. The Red Sox Maki ($12.95), made with big chunks of tuna and avocado with tobiko on top, was presented with generous swirls of spicy mayo underneath. The sushi roll itself was very simple. The tuna was quite fresh, and the crunchiness of the tobiko balanced out the mushiness of the avocado.
The Scallion Pancake ($9.95), thin and greasy, was a disappointment. The pancake did not have enough scallions and tasted too floury.
Oh, and one more note: If you want to enjoy your meal without the background noise of college students pounding on the table and yelling, "Ichi, ni, san, sake bomb!" make sure to visit Shabu-Ya for lunch.
