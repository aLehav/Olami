After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is sadly time to say goodbye.
Goodbye to the “hey, how ya doing?” friend. Farewell to the smile and wave boy. See you never to the quick chat in line for the waffle maker girl. And yes, so long to the “let’s grab a meal” squad.
For most of the student body, this will be a semester, if not a year, of remoteness. Yes, physically remote from the campus we usually call home, but also emotionally remote from the varying ties that bond us as a community.
When we think of our Harvard communities, most likely the first thought is of our blockmates, our best friends, the one professor with the life-changing class. But what about the acquaintances? The almost friend you had a class with freshman year or the ex-roommate you don’t really talk to anymore. These more distant relations anchor you to the larger context of a university experience. These are the people with whom your bond is not quite strong enough to last a quarantine. These are the people we have to say goodbye to.
While much bigger problems may be afoot, it is okay to take a moment to mourn this loss. We are all losing the semester we expected, and therefore losing people we thought we would have more time with.
Not all relationships can withstand distance; it is a fact of life. Some relationships are a matter of convenience and some a matter of circumstance. This is perfectly fine. Relationships come into our lives to serve a purpose, to serve a moment in time. Some adapt to support multiple stages in life, but there are relationships that contribute to who we are for one season and fade to black the next. All this is the way of the world. There is a time and a place for everything. In truth, this is what would happen in all our post-grad lives.
Then what’s the big deal? Why does this loss seem to hurt more?
It is because we were not done yet.
These acquaintanceships still stood a chance. There was time for them to develop and grow into friendships. There was time for them to contribute a little bit more, to push our perspectives a little bit farther. So much can change in a semester. A semester is all it takes for someone you barely know to become your best friend. For this, we can allow a moment of sadness.
Moment’s over. Now what?
It is time to make a choice. You already know which friends have been important enough to keep in contact with over quarantine. You’ve been maintaining these friendships by force over the past six months. Now is the time to assess the rest of your Rolodex and decide if there is anyone else you want to commit to. Is there someone with enough potential that you are willing to send the first text?
In the comfort of a community, relationships can just happen. You run into someone enough times, and suddenly you know them. They are a part of your life in some way. But in this new world of social distancing and remote learning, relationships are a choice. An effort. A commitment. Things are not so easy anymore.
We need to take advantage of the new methods of connection we have. It is much easier to sit quietly in a Zoom breakout room and let the clock tick until you go back to lecture. It is much easier to skip the online HoCo meetings and virtual entryway hangouts. It is harder to put yourself out there, to stoke the conversation, to show up.
Social distancing does not have to mean social isolation. In fact, it can’t if we have any hope of staying sane. If there was ever something to work hard for, it is this: keeping our networks strong, supporting ourselves and each other.
So, we may mourn the disappointment of fallen expectations and the comfort of broad circles. We also turn our focus to the potentiality of new relationships on the horizon. We may have fewer members of our circle of friends, but hopefully, with enough will power, we can build stronger bonds that will stand the test of time and space.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pierre R. Berastain Ojeda ’10 stepped down as director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response on Aug. 21 to pursue nonprofit work in Washington, D.C.
Berastain departed after more than two years leading OSAPR, which provides counseling and sexual assault prevention resources for all Harvard affiliates.
During his tenure, Berastain and OSAPR staff implemented a “community engagement model,” shifting away from a reactive “clinical” approach and prioritizing interactions with students. They developed a direct service model that brought in clinicians with mental health backgrounds to staff the office.
The engagement model included expanded support from Consent Advocacy and Relationship Education tutors within the undergraduate houses and a reestablished advisory council, which collects input from faculty, staff, and students.
“Our hotline usage and our direct service usage in the last two years has increased tremendously,” Berastain said, referring to the office’s 24/7 confidential hotline and individualized support and advocacy services.
Under Berastain, OSAPR also spearheaded efforts to strengthen its relationships with underserved Harvard populations.
“We couldn’t offer a cookie-cutter or a standardized way of working with survivors or people seeking our services,” Berastain said. “We had to really think holistically and population-specific, culturally-specific ways.”
He cited partnerships with other University offices, including the Harvard University Native American Program and University Disability Resources, that enabled OSAPR to tailor its services.
Amid the pandemic, OSAPR has had to adapt to the constraints of virtual programming owing to geographical and technological divides as well as adverse home environments some students face.
“You can imagine you might want to speak with someone — an advocate, a counselor, or someone who can help you think through some of the issues that you’re experiencing,” Berastain said. “But you may not be able to actually do it because you don’t have the space to do it.”
“People call from the closet or calling as you’re walking in a park and talking about these issues,” he added. “It’s not ideal.”
Despite these challenges, Berastain said OSAPR staff has sought to accommodate students by scheduling appointments outside the typical nine-to-five workday. The office also broadened the services they help students access to include agencies outside the Greater Boston area.
Berastain leaves a vacancy in OSAPR’s executive post as the College begins a completely online fall semester, with most undergraduates living off campus.
The University still has yet to announce Berastain's departure or outline plans to replace him. It is unclear whether a University-wide hiring freeze will affect Harvard’s ability to fill his position in the near future.
Berastain now serves as deputy director of the District Alliance for Safe Housing, an organization that assists survivors of domestic and sexual violence in accessing safe housing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Xfund — a venture capital firm born out of a collaboration between Harvard University, New Enterprise Associates, and Breyer Capital — closed its most recent oversubscribed fund, Xfund 3, at $120 million.
The firm is unusual in its deep, years-long partnership with the University and its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Since Xfund’s founding, every SEAS Dean and Harvard Innovation Labs Executive Director has served on the firm’s board. The student president of Harvard Student Agencies acts as an advisor to Xfund; in turn, the firm sits on the board of HSA.
“We just have such a deep commitment to the University, to helping the University build out its new engineering school, to helping the University promote this vision of a liberal arts education, even when studying computer science, even when studying engineering,” Patrick S. Chung ’96 said.
Co-founded in 2011 by Chung and Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, and currently co-managed by Chung and Brandon Farwell, Xfund describes its mission as combining “the raw talent, intellectual rigor, and free-thinking of academia with the hard-nosed investment acumen of venture capital.” Companies Xfund has invested in include biotechnology company 23andMe and artificial intelligence start-up Kensho.
According to Chung, this newest iteration of the fund is most notable for offering liberal arts school graduates a viable way to start a company rather than follow a default career path, boosting founders from typically non-entrepreneurial backgrounds, and continuing a robust collaboration with Harvard.
“That liberal arts graduates and liberal arts founders are actually really spectacular is, I think, the hypothesis that we set out to prove,” he said. “And, so far — again, knock on wood for the future — but so far, we’ve been able to prove.”
HSA President Akanksha Sah ’21 said one goal of Xfund 3 is to expand the firm’s commitment to diversifying venture capital investments.
“Only two percent of all venture capital dollars in the US are invested in women. But when you look at Xfund, 33 percent of the capital is invested in women. And then if you expand that to include women and immigrants it’s 52 percent. If you include women, immigrants, and minorities, it’s 72 percent,” Sah said.
Sah added that though Xfund’s demographics are significantly more diverse than national standards, the firm still has room for improvement.
“We're always looking to be better, particularly in light of the recent civil rights movements. We’re really trying to double down on our efforts,” Sah said. “That’s something that we’ll definitely be focusing on in Xfund 3.”
Maintaining offices in both Palo Alto, Calif. and Cambridge, Xfund aims to support unique and innovative ideas while offering a credible alternative to the more common post-graduate job routes, according to Chung.
“Harvard gets some of the best and brightest in the world. And by some measures, almost 40 percent of people who graduate flood into the arms of default careers, they go to join management consulting firms like I did, they go to manage, they go to investment banks,” Chung said. “If a huge proportion of the people who are graduating actually want to do that, then more power to them. But it’s probably not that high a number.”
Chung added that Xfund strives to ensure students have the option to build the companies they have dreamt of since childhood with the backing of a venture capital firm.
“Part of what we view as the social mission of Xfund is to ensure that everyone who graduates who has a truly creative instinct, who actually wants to create something new, create a new enterprise, that they have the opportunity to do so, that they have the opportunity to have their full social impact, intellectual impact, financial impact in the world.”
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, who served as Dean of the College from 1995 to 2003 and interim Dean of SEAS in 2015, serves as Xfund’s founding faculty advisor. Lewis first became interested when Chung approached him with the idea of starting a fund with a specific connection to Harvard as an undergraduate.
Now, Lewis acts as a bridge between Xfund and Harvard, connecting Chung with students seeking to discuss ideas for new companies.
“Some of those companies that Xfund has funded, actually, were started by people I knew from a classroom setting before. So that’s, of course, been satisfying to see,” Lewis said.
In 2009, Tuan A. Ho ’09 and Nicholas B. Krasney ’09 started what would become Xfund’s first-ever investment in 2011 — internet television company Philo — in a dorm room in Dunster House, plastering the walls with aluminum foil.
Coming from a family of physicians, Ho had planned to attend medical school following graduation. But after passing by the Office of Career Services one day and hearing Chung deliver a talk on start up companies, Ho said he was inspired to delve more deeply into the idea that ultimately became Philo.
“I still remember that day because it was the thing that really set me down that path,” Ho said. “It was like after meeting Patrick and all that, that I kind of made the decision for myself that you know what, I think I'm going to seriously consider this.”
After graduating, Ho decided to defer his medical school acceptance, opting to continue working on the television streaming service idea with Krasney in the cheapest Somerville apartment they could find.
Ho credits Xfund with helping to legitimize start-ups as a valid career path following graduation and believes the firm is an important resource for any student interested in building a company from the ground up.
“In 2008, the culture was completely different, right. The idea of doing a startup was not really seen as like a legitimate career path,” Ho said, adding that Xfund “became one, I think, rather important piece of the larger entrepreneurship ecosystem that started to blossom around Harvard in the 2010s.”
Sah said she believes one of Xfund’s strengths lies in its close relationship with student organizations.
“It was sort of started as a way to help make sure none of those ideas slip through the cracks or don't get the attention they deserve when they can have so much potential,” Sah said. “Having a couple of students who are on the ground on campus, meeting all of these people and hearing all of these ideas, it’s a lot easier than waiting for those ideas to actually come to you.”
As an advisor to Xfund, Sah is always on the lookout for unique ideas from students that help maintain the relationship between Xfund and students that the venture capital firm touts as mutually beneficial.
“The relationship of Xfund supporting young entrepreneurs and young entrepreneurs basically reaching out to Xfund as a resource for themselves is really a very symbiotic relationship for us because it obviously helps the VC to find successful, great ideas and it helps people to get the funding to run those successful, great ideas,” Sah said.
Chung hopes that Xfund 3 will continue to shift the risk balance of post-graduation careers, providing graduates with the support they need to pursue creative entrepreneurship. Xfund bases itself on a belief that numerous people might have been as successful as Microsoft founder Bill Gates or Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg but lacked a safety net to pursue those endeavors upon graduation, according to Chung.
“If Xfund can take one of those people and make them the next Gates or Zuckerberg, then I think there will be, knock on wood, a lot of social contribution, intellectual contribution, financial contribution, to the University, to the world, and really to the lives of all those founders and also everyone who gets to work there,” Chung said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Business School searches for a new dean amidst a burgeoning national movement for racial justice, one recent alumnus has written a case study that urges the school to take concrete action on diversity initiatives.
Current Business School Dean Nitin Nohria first announced in November 2019 that he planned to step down at the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. After the COVID-19 pandemic struck in spring 2020, however, Nohria eventually elected to stay on through December 2020 to guide the school through the virus’s disruptions.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the dean search.
The Business School’s next dean will take the helm of a school struggling with long-standing racial inequalities, both in the demographics of its classrooms and the content of its course materials.
Just 5 percent of HBS students identified as Black as of Fall 2018, a number that had remained stagnant since 2008.
HBS students learn by analyzing case studies, in which students take on the role of a protagonist and provide recommendations on how to approach a given business or leadership challenge. HBS faculty write nearly 80 percent of case studies used at business schools around the world, per the school’s website.
But according to a case study written by Alterrell Mills ’10 — who received his MBA from HBS in 2016 — of the 250 cases which all HBS students read in their first year, less than 4 percent feature a black protagonist.
Mills wrote the study to summarize the diversity and inclusion dilemmas the school faces. He said in an interview that the Business School’s “rushed” efforts to respond to several high-profile police killings of Black Americans this summer in part inspired him to create the case study. He said the school held a town hall in the middle of the workday and did not record the conversation or provide notes for Business School affiliates.
Mills claimed the school has long pledged to study its diversity shortcomings, and questioned why such studies had taken so long to materialize.
“I’m not really sure why four or five years later, they have the same questions. If it’s the best business school with the best minds... It seems to me like, I hate to say it’s a stall tactic, but it seems to me like it’s a delay tactic,” Mills said.
Mills noted that several other HBS competitors, including Stanford’s Graduate School of Business and Columbia Business School, had quickly announced diversity action plans, while the business school had not.
His case study begins by describing University President Lawrence S. Bacow looking back on both the COVID-19 pandemic and the racial justice developments of the summer. Turning to the HBS Dean search, the fictionalized Bacow then reflects on a letter African American HBS alumni sent in January lobbying for a dean who would prioritize diversity and inclusion.
Mills then summarizes the learning model of the school before turning to the lack of Black representation in the student body, the faculty, and the broader business world. He concludes the case study with a sample letter articulating several proposals to increase diversity at the school, including reporting diversity progress in the school’s annual report, increasing the number of female and minority protagonists in case studies to at least 25 percent, and increasing Black enrollment.
Harvard Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny declined to comment on the dean search but lauded Mills’ efforts in an emailed statement.
“We appreciate Alterrell’s efforts to bring attention to this important matter and we respect his opinions about areas for improvement. Within the month, Harvard Business School will launch a detailed plan addressing how we will improve in diversity across every area of the School,” Kenny wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cookies — a California-based, minority-operated marijuana dispensary chain – is set to open its doors in Cambridge and occupy the former Staples Inc. space within the Crimson Galleria.
Cookies’s opening comes after the owner of the Crimson Galeria, Raj K. Dhanda, sued Healthy Pharms Inc., a Massachusetts based, non-profit marijuana distributor, in 2017 for attempting to open a medical marijuana dispensary on Winthrop Street. In his 2017 complaint, Dhanda said his businesses had been “substantially injured by a conspiracy to sell marijuana.”
Dhanda has since accepted a settlement to the lawsuit, and this week, he commented on his plans to host the Cookies cannabis dispensary in his Harvard Square property in an open letter to the public.
In the letter, Dhanda wrote that his opinion on the cannabis industry has “evolved” and “prior views [he] had on many aspects of the industry were misinformed.”
Dhanda wrote that Cookies in Harvard Square will be a “great community partner” which is “extremely committed to providing community benefits.” He also wrote that his plans were influenced by the lack of minority-owned cannabis businesses in the city.
“I learned that so few licenses across the entire Commonwealth had been awarded to economic empowerment applicants,” the letter reads. “I knew there was an opportunity to give back to the community, to promote minority entrepreneurship, and to do something bigger than just filling another space.”
“Economic empowerment applicants” are businesses that receive marijuana licenses from the state through a program that intends to help groups disproportionately impacted by past drug policies.
Dhanda said he is enthusiastic about the opportunity to provide space for Cookies in Cambridge.
“Knowing that the new dispensary at the Crimson Galeria will be a minority owned and operated establishment is something we can all take pride in,” he wrote in the letter.
Damond Hughes, the operator of Cookies in Harvard Square, said in an interview Monday that the company has been looking for locations in the greater Boston area for roughly three years.
“When we were actually provided with an opportunity in this Harvard Square location, we jumped at it,” Hughes said.
Hughes said he hopes the dispensary's opening will present opportunities for people of color.
“You want to put people not in just positions to be employees or managers — we would like people to become owners,” said Hughes.
Still, some Cambridge residents are not quite as excited about the prospect of the store opening in the Crimson Galeria. At a community meeting last week, residents supported the opening of the dispensary, but said they have reservations about its particular location in Harvard Square.
Meeting attendees voiced concerns about the increased access young people may have to marijuana, additional exposure to secondhand smoke, and fears that the store’s large windows would widely advertise the product, especially as nearby Winthrop Park is frequently visited by families.
Fine Arts and African American Studies professor Suzanne P. Blier, who is also president of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the “100-foot glass facade [would] make this one of the largest retail storefronts in the Square and a massive billboard for cannabis use.”
Blier, who attended the community meeting last week, also suggested that other sites in Cambridge might be better alternatives for the cannabis store.
“We would love, and we tried to get it in our petition, for this to be at a different place, even your Central Square place,” Blier said at the meeting. “There are lots of basements including one in this building and other places around the 2nd floor, or a narrow entry, with something that opens up larger.”
Hughes said he felt there was no better alternative to the Square location.
“What’s wrong with this location? There isn’t a better location,” Hughes said in an interview. “We need a great location. We don’t belong in the basement.”
Blier wrote in an email to The Crimson that the HSNA supports bringing Cookies into Harvard Square but believes the store should not be located near a “family-oriented park.”
At the meeting, Cookies representatives stressed their plans to promote responsible consumption of legal marijuana.
In accordance with Massachusetts law, no marijuana will be visible from the street outside of Cookies, Joseph P. Hanley, an attorney working on the project, said at the community meeting.
Rebecca Adams, an advisor for Cookies, said at the meeting that all entrants will have their identification checked at the door to ensure they are at least 21 years of age, adding that consumption of products on site is forbidden. Motion detectors, video monitoring, and tamper-proof packaging will be in place at the store, she added.
Cookies has also considered several measures to limit queuing to reduce virus spread during the pandemic, including “order-ready” alerts, scheduled appointments, and self-pay kiosks, Hughes said.
Hughes also said Cookies plans to dedicate one percent of gross sales to the creation of a nonprofit charity and to donate to homeless individuals in the Square. At the meeting last week, Cookies representatives said the store will help fund beautification efforts in Winthrop Park and will participate in Harvard Square Neighborhood Association meetings.
Dhanda wrote in his letter that Cookies has “opened [his] mind” to the marijuana industry.
“Their plans to mitigate community concerns and to reinvigorate commercial activity in the neighborhood are thorough and convincing,” Dhanda wrote in his open letter. “Their commitment to community benefits and to diversity, inclusion, and equity is unparalleled among anything I have seen in the Square over recent decades.”
“The time is now to support the minority entrepreneurs, operators, and business owners who are seeking to bring an equitable balance back not just to their industries, but also to the City of Cambridge itself,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the Ivy League’s decision to cancel fall sports and uncertainty over future seasons amid the ongoing pandemic, many athletic recruits committed to the Harvard College Class of 2025 say they plan to stand by their choice.
Interviewed students said they approve of the league’s cancellation, even given its impact on activities they have devoted themselves to for years.
Owen M. Gaffney, a lacrosse midfield recruit from Los Angeles, Calif., said he agrees with officials’ justification for postponing the season.
“Everybody’s health and safety is the main priority, and it’s important for that to be the first priority, not sports just yet — as much as I’d kill for it. And I think we will play” in 2021, Gaffney said. “The first thing to get down is the health and safety of everybody and controlling this pandemic.”
Students like Gaffney have weighed competing offers from coaches across the country, including those in conferences that are proceeding with competitions amid the public health crisis. But he and other students say the Ivy League’s conservative approach will not dissuade them from choosing Harvard.
Gavin E. Shipman, a football prospect from Alabaster, Ala., said he would not consider changing his college decision even if the pandemic — and sports cancellations — continue into his freshman fall.
“There’s not much you can do; you control what you can and deal with everything else,” Shipman said.
Football recruit Ledger G. Hatch said he traveled to Cambridge to meet the team just before College students faced sudden evacuation from campus.
“It felt like it was meant to be just because everything got shut down like right after, so it was really, really nice,” Hatch said.
Several commits said superior academic opportunities were decisive factors in their preference for Harvard over competing programs amid the pandemic.
“Athletic careers are always going to come to an end, but the knowledge you gain over college is never going to die,” Gaffney said.
Mayowa G. Olibale, a volleyball recruit from Katy, Tex., concurred.
“My mom is an immigrant from Nigeria,” Olibale said. “Something my mom would hope for all of her children is to go to a really good school and just be able to provide for my family.”
Though their freshman sports experience remains in flux, many committed Harvard recruits are bonding with their peers in quarantine. Football recruit William “Jack” Gentle said they are already forming a tight-knit group.
“We have a group chat where we have gotten to know each other a bit, and we’ve got a GroupMe where some people play video games together,” Gentle said.
The team “has a culture of being welcoming like a true family, and that’s shown through everybody getting together, talking, being friendly, wishing each other Happy Birthdays and Merry Christmas,” Gaffney said. “I’m not sure if it’s accelerated because of the virus; I think it’s always kind of been a thing — especially with Harvard.”

Now that classes have officially started, we all need something to look forward to when each arduous week comes to a close. Even though partying is off the table (please social distance!), your Friday nights don’t need to be as dull as they were during early quarantine. Check out these fun ideas to spend your weekends remotely!
Whine and Cheese
Taken directly from Parks and Recreation, Whine and Cheese is perfect after a tough week. Grab a couple friends, a bottle of wine, some cheap cheeses, and get ready for some sanctioned complaining with friends. Have your parents knock on your door to recreate the occasional paranoia in your dorm.
PowerPoint Parties
This one requires a little extra work ahead of time, but it’s well worth it and definitely fit for Harvard students. Each person makes a short presentation about something they’re passionate about: the ending of Game of Thrones, sourdough bread, Truly’s vs. White Claw — anything goes!
Bring the Grill Home
Throp Grill is great, but so are microwaved chicken nuggets. Cook up a gourmet snack for yourself, because #selfcare and because nothing washes the pain of a pset away like a milkshake. For even more convenience, pull a Michael Scott and try hooking up a grill right next to your bed. Gourmet!
Dancing Queen
Just because you’re not sweating and sticking to the floor in the Mather JCR doesn’t mean you can’t be tearing up the dance floor. Dance like it’s 2012 in front of your mirror to some old school bops. Maybe bring your mom.
Astral Project
Friends on the other side of the world (or the other side of a wall, but in a different suite)? Visit them in your dreams. Hit the hay early and try your best to dream into an alternate reality where everybody is back together again. Worst comes to worst you get a good night’s sleep and can be ready for a roaring Saturday night of…oh wait…
On campus or off, Fridays are meant to be celebrated. So be it whining, wining, cheesing, or dreaming, make sure you TGIF and give yourself a well earned break!
