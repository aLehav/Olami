From feudal English peasant revolts to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations, music has been an important medium through which to act out against oppression. In the United States, the 1960s were a golden age for the protest song, and their legacy lives on today through artists who continue to use the genre to address contemporary issues. Though protest songs can share stylistic and thematic similarities, each one has its own specific temporality and the ability to memorialize a particular movement. Decades later, for example, John Lennon’s “Imagine” still arouses vivid images of his and Yoko Ono’s bed-ins, long-haired hippies advocating peace and love, and fervent student demonstrations—a nation in moral crisis. The power of the protest genre lies, then, in this ability to at once evoke a specific moment in history and subsequently transcend it.
Protest songs have been used as a tool to bridge gaps between individuals and groups, and this is perhaps best reflected in the act of sharing them. Creating and listening becomes a mutualistic process in which one expresses emotions and another in turn gleans his or her own personal meaning from the songs. By inserting his or her political opinions into a song, an artist can potentially galvanize a movement or become an advocate for the voiceless. Though some protest songs, particularly in the United States, are launched by prominent musicians into instant success, the most powerful tracks often originate from anonymous activists of less mainstream movements. Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land,” for example, was originally a critique of American exceptionalism and was censored by the U.S. government for alleged Communist associations. However, the song continued to be shared at rallies, around campfires, and in progressive schools, and it eventually became the widely known tune it is today. This grassroots method of dispersion can create a greater sense of camaraderie around the song and heighten its meaning in a movement.
The recent shift toward sharing and discovering music online may have new implications for the role of the protest song in social movements. Protest songs are effective as shared entities because they allow listeners to tap into their own frustrations with society and move them to enter the discussion, yet sites like Pandora serve as a prime example of the sometimes automated, algorithmic way in which new artists are now discovered. While this process does not necessarily diminish the musical experience, such mechanical programs may make it more difficult for protest groups to advance their causes using music. Though these tracks can now reach an exponentially wider global audience, there is the danger that online campaigns may never reach beyond the virtual space. Awareness is significantly more attainable, but it now does not always translate into activism. Sharing a protest song, liking a Facebook post, tweeting about a trending hashtag—all these actions are valuable in showing solidarity, but the convenience with which they can be performed may increase the danger of causes being diminished to passing fads. This may not be what Bob Marley had in mind when he implored the public to “Get Up, Stand Up.”
This gesture of motivating the public to action is carried out by musicians through a variety of approaches. Artists like Rage Against The Machine and Kendrick Lamar jolt their listeners out of complacency with sweeping aggression, questioning authority both lyrically and musically. Musicians also frequently focus on the victims of oppression, and, in doing so, appeal to a listener’s sense of social responsibility. Though Bob Dylan is renowned for this type of social commentary, he rejects being called a spokesman for his generation. In fact, his political works span a short era of his career. On the other hand, in an interview with National Public Radio, M.I.A. confesses to struggling with the inverse dilemma of feeling bound to represent her homeland. “A lot of people were like, ‘Just make music; don’t talk about politics.’ But I was in a very difficult position: I was the only Tamil rapper [on the international stage], so when a whole bunch of Tamil people were dying, I had to tell you about it.” Though Dylan and M.I.A. may differ in how they define their roles, both evidently feel compelled to use their art to comment on the social and political issues of their times. This intention to disrupt a morally unacceptable status quo is ultimately what can unite protest songs across time and musical style.
Despite the specificity of protest songs, such tracks have the potential eventually to go beyond their specific eras. While they continue to represent the causes they were written to promulgate, many of these songs, from “Imagine” to “Get Up, Stand Up,” have become so deeply embedded in mainstream culture that they are reused for later movements. A protest song may even become a general symbol of freedom outside of the political domain. Ultimately, these songs act as a foundation off of which others may build—an archive to which the disenchanted may return.

She had watched the men from the insurance company inspect the bowls in the sink, four-day-old dried flecks of grease, yellow rings of seasoning floating above the puddle of liquid left over in the bowl that would remain unless rinsed out or licked up. She had watched them tromp up the stairs to determine how damaging the footprints the firefighters had pressed into the carpet were, the rectangles of their thick boots distinct, stamped in. Lai had shown them. She had watched. He hadn’t mentioned how it’d all happened—grease fire was all he had said, which was what he’d told the EMTs also, and the police—that she’d been the one to leave the stove roaring, the oil uncovered, too busy pinching fingerfulls off the fritters, the latkes, or whatever they would be called. It didn’t matter now. She had kept salting them and salting them, thinking it wasn’t enough, silvering the potato. Meanwhile the flame had still been on. Meanwhile the bud of the fire that she could not forget as Lai seemed to have—how she had been afraid watching him throw towels over it through smoke that seemed to burn her eyes, how he had been calm and methodical—had been unfurling at the bottom of the wok.
She wished he had mentioned it. She wanted to call the men up now. She’d tell them. It had been her. They could stop casting looks at the bottle of fish sauce on the kitchen table, stop staring at Lai’s slippered feet, stop whispering when they didn’t think he was listening. They could stop watching—though never speaking to—her. Like she was a glass too close to the edge of a table or an exquisitely white cat that kept trying to lick its paws clean of ash, but kept failing, but kept trying anyway.
She would tell them of all the nights she’d spent in Lai’s bed, which she now realized had been Lai’s bed all along, curled like a comma into the hollow space of his body, her back against his chest, her knees tucked around his knees. Nesting spoons had worked for her previous boyfriends but not for Lai; even enveloped in his warmth there hadn’t been that clank of two things fitting correctly together, that chime. She thought of all the times she, facing away from him, had felt his dumb, flaccid penis against her. She thought of how she’d move herself against him, almost like she was shifting in her sleep, to rub some hardness into it. It had been heavy, limp. She was sure it was now, too. She wanted to put her face very close to the sink until the white enamel erased the nausea that threaded up her throat each time she thought about it.
They had begun seeing each other years ago, before everyone they knew one by one lost their jobs and before their friends, dressed in flannel and holding signs above their heads, had gotten tear gassed by cops in lower Manhattan. It had been winter, not snowy but cold, and they had agreed to meet for dinner. She had stood outside the restaurant, chin pushed into her scarf, her shoulders curved against the wind. The streetlamps had been orange. Lai’s black coat had glowed under them as he walked toward her, and she could see even at that distance his nose crumpling as he sniffed. He’d tell her later he had a bit of a cold, and she’d excuse him for not kissing her at her front door. There would be kisses later, for years and years, though now she couldn’t distinguish if they’d been genuine or if he had never loved her as he’d said.
The streetlamps, too, colored his skin, and she’d thought he’d looked beautiful, sturdy and kind. He’d smiled when he saw her standing there. Then his foot had hit a disk of ice on the sidewalk and he’d tilted. Arms had flown out from his pockets, his torso suddenly like a bird, untethered, unwanting. His face had emptied in surprise.
She didn’t want to think that had been the first and last time he’d been so honest with her—that orange-lit street, the visible puffs they both exhaled, the dim chatter from inside the restaurant widening whenever the door opened. The buttons on Lai’s black coat gleaming like the hard shine of his hair. She didn’t want to remember his face when he’d slipped on the ice, though she did even now, even as she moved cans around the pantry, searching for something other than soup. There were some beans, some fruit in sugar syrup. The cans closest to the doors of the pantry had acquired a film over them, although whether it was dust or ash Maria didn’t know.
She thought she could hear Lai shuffling around in his office, the legs of his chair scraping against the floor. He’d taken the couch downstairs since telling her and was always up before she came downstairs, a blanket already folded and pushed to the side, the pillow he’d taken from the guest room on top of it. He was waiting for her. Sometimes she wanted to sneak downstairs to watch him sleep, but he was a light sleeper. She wouldn’t, if only to keep him waiting longer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So. I’m participating in a thing that has openly identified itself as a “safe space.” Bonding is like, half the point. There are icebreakers, massage circles, and times explicitly delineated for processing and journaling. Everyone’s having deep conversations, and relishing in the fact that they are having deep conversations. It’s great. The space is 50 shades of safe.
And then, in a group of people, someone asks me if I’m “a full black.”
So. I’m at a big international poetry slam. Being social justice minded is basically a prerequisite. All the nametags come with stickers for PGPs. There’s a Black Lives Matter discussion, and it’s closed to allies. It’s unusual to not have purple hair. The place is rife with consciousness. It’s beautiful. It’s safe.
And then a white poet gets on stage and says the n-word a few times.
So. I’m realizing “safe space” might mean different things for different people.
For many, all it takes to make a space safe is the ability to talk about their feelings without being judged. That’s totally valid. For others, all it takes is for everyone to try really hard not to say anything obviously prejudiced—or at least not on purpose. And that’s a good start. But I think I’ve been thinking about safe spaces in, perhaps, a more literal way: A space in which I feel safe, which seems obvious, and not that hard to attain. But there are a surprising number of things here that make me feel a lot less than safe.
For me, a safe space is one in which I feel that I can express all aspects of my identity without feeling that any one of those aspects will get me (including, but not limited to) judged, fired, marginalized, attacked, or killed. In these spaces, I expect to be able to let my guard down for a moment, to not be on high alert about what I can and cannot say or about what others may or may not say. There are plenty of spaces in which I enter thinking, “Okay, so here I shouldn’t bring up my girlfriend” or “Here I should water down some of my more radical views” or “Here I should choose not to fight that battle, because yeah that was racist but it wasn’t like that racist.” Or perhaps “Here I should be waiting for a comment that is going to make my skin crawl, I should be ready to respond to that in some way that is safe to respond in this space.”
Here’s the thing: If your safety obviously comes with an asterisk, your space is not safe. And you shouldn’t call it safe, because that is dangerous.
So. I was in Israel over spring break. We had a talk with a man who was in charge of LGBT issues and tourism in Tel Aviv. This was an official municipal position, I’m pretty sure. He told us this story about how he stumbled upon an online poll, asking people to vote for “The best gay city in the world!” And he noticed that practically no one had really voted for any popular “gay cities” yet. So he called all of his friends and had them vote for Tel Aviv. And so Tel Aviv was voted the best gay city in the world. Which is cool. And it was great for gay tourism in Tel Aviv. But I couldn’t help to think that that could be dangerous. That’s what we’re doing when we call unsafe spaces, or less safe spaces, “safe spaces.” Rigging the vote in a way that could endanger people expecting a space to be, genuinely, at least as safe as it gets. Façades of safety can be worse than outright unsafe places. Which is to say that there are places where I expect to hear the n-word from white people. (Unfortunately one of those places is in my dorm, from the white boys next door. I’m looking at you, Wigg.) And there are places where I don’t.
The poetry slam, though, presents the real question. At this point in reality, can there even be a truly safe space? They did all the right things. They preached all the right sermons. But that white poet still thought that shit was okay. And that was when I started thinking about Harvard.
Recently I’ve been applying for a few on-campus internships with centers and organizations that have taken up the call to create safe spaces. And, as applications often do, these asked that typical question “What can we do better?” Unfortunately, I think what they can do better might be impossible. Safe spaces that are truly safe spaces here are always, always self-selected spaces.
Of course, the thought on the issue of creating safe spaces and issues related to safe spaces is also a self-selective activity. So sure, maybe there were meetings and emails and forums and a lot of thought dedicated to creating safe spaces at that poetry slam, but that white poet and her coach did not choose to participate. Sure, there are plenty of spaces at Harvard that are at least almost truly safe spaces. There are much, much safer spaces. But the white boys in Wigg aren’t going to choose to be in those spaces. That doesn’t mean they won’t be in my sections, or in my comp meetings, or in other spaces that may profess themselves as “safe.” I don’t know how to fix that.
I do know that creating safe spaces is important, contrary to a recent New York Times article professing safe spaces as a continuation of the desire of the hyper-sensitive college student to prevent themselves from experiencing “ticklish” conversations and aid in their own “self-infantilization.” Maybe the issue is also that there are people here who agree with that sentiment. Maybe that’s understandable. If you don’t have any facets of your experience or identity that could be mobilized against you that could cause you harm, panic, anxiety, disadvantage, or other fairly “ticklish” things, it could be hard to imagine a reality in which other people’s words can actually, literally hurt you. I don’t know what we can do to change it, but openly acknowledging that some of the safe spaces at nice, progressive Harvard aren’t all that safe for some of us sounds like a good start.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time to talk about dismantling final clubs. Their existence is premised on exclusivity. It is central to their role in the campus social landscape. Being a final club member signifies fitting into an elite social circle that rejects subpar classmates. The clubs foster de facto sexual violence, racism, and class domination. Only abolition of the clubs will show true commitment to inclusion and respect.
Clubs function on the premise that outsiders don’t deserve to know how they operate. What we know comes from hearsay or leaked emails. Without transparency in selection, we are left with a sour taste in our mouths as we see the “elite” among us get selected for punch. How can a club be truly diverse when its membership process is predicated on double-selectiveness? Punch squelches any possibility of attracting members with truly varied experiences.
Despite the secrecy, clubs are constantly a topic of campus conversation, dating back to a 1958 Crimson article: “there is a strong undemocratic tinge to the system which rubs off on anyone who joins it…only the most exceptional Jew or Negro would have a chance of being accepted.”
In fact, the first black member of a final club was initiated in 1965, over a century after the first black student was admitted to the College. While current diversity figures for final clubs are slightly better than 1965, it’s impossible to ignore the public image: pockets of white wealthy partiers, sealed off from the rest of campus in million-dollar mansions. After all, in 2013, a solid 26 percent of final club members reported in Flyby's final club survey that they come from backgrounds with parental incomes over $500,000.
And we haven’t yet mentioned sexism. As a final club member in 2010 wrote, “All-male final clubs carve out a corner of the social world that revolves around the preferences of men, and men alone.” All-male final clubs still rely on females who come to their parties. Women are, in this scenario, props used to make male-dominated party spaces more “fun.” In 1984, when final clubs weren’t interested in gender integration, the College disaffiliated from them on the basis of gender discrimination.
Recently, the Spee Club sent out invitations to a “pajama party” featuring Playboy imagery and a video of scantily clad women as a means of inviting guests to “stay the night.” The club issued an apology—but is it an apology for the latest in final club sexism, or an apology that they were caught?
Harvard has no control over what final clubs choose to do, or what happens at final clubs. This is especially troubling as Harvard’s final clubs just can’t seem to shake their reputation as havens for sexual assault. While some clubs do choose to undergo training with Harvard's Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, this is not required by any means—in the 2012-2013 school year, it was considered a success that OSAPR trained all but two of the clubs.
Dean Khurana’s attempts to bring to light the issues of final club diversity are commendable, but we have doubts about the efficacy of one dean’s protests against a historically solid network of final club members and alumni. The administration explains its inaction by claiming lack of jurisdiction. Final clubs are considered off-campus spaces by the administration, despite the fact that they surround the River Houses. The administration’s silence is a political position that amounts to complicity in the damaging culture fostered by the final clubs.
It is of no use to discuss how these clubs may coexist with the rest of the campus, or how they might be made more inclusive. The recent but small strides in diversity that the clubs tout should not distract from the privilege and exclusion that drive the clubs’ activities.
Our concern is this: the clubs’ elite membership go on to run the world in the image of how they understand it—through the narrow lens of exclusion. Harvard commends itself on valuing diversity and inclusion. We must not tacitly tolerate institutions that facilitate such damaging social spaces. By allowing these institutions to exclude, Harvard condones an ideology of false “deservingness” that has caused exclusionary harm in the past.
Every day that the University does not acknowledge the final club problem is another day complicit in elitism and exclusion. While the ideal final outcome is the abolition of these clubs, the administration must begin by thoughtfully engaging with clubs to identify what real purpose they serve for students. And with student input, the University must prove to us that it values open, safer, and diverse social spaces, providing regular and well-planned alternatives to final club parties and supporting social events within dorm rooms and residential houses. Students in final clubs must consider their own complicity in these structures. We ask them to ponder their membership in institutions that actively discriminate against their classmates, weighing this membership against values of inclusion, honor, and equal opportunity.

The Crimson’s recent scrutiny on regional diversity at Harvard highlighted the disproportionate representation of students from a few select states on campus. While we certainly do not believe in any type of zip-code quota system, it is also clear that there is value in a student body that draws from all parts of the country and all around the world. Applications to Harvard are concentrated in regions that already send a disproportionate number of students here, and the College should continue increasing its outreach—especially its people-to-people recruitment efforts—in areas like the Midwest and Mountain regions, which are underrepresented in both the applicant pool and on campus. This year saw a marked increase in applications from this region—with admissions decisions coming out Tuesday, we hope that this trend will result in greater geographic diversity.
According to the scrutiny on regional diversity at Harvard, over half of American freshmen are from New York, New Jersey, California, or Massachusetts. Additionally, while only 4.6 percent of the U.S. population calls New England home, 21.3 percent of this year’s non-international freshmen hail from these six states.
One method for Harvard is to shift resources from schools with which Harvard already has strong relationships to schools that do not routinely send students here. The seven high schools that sent the most students to Harvard this year—all of which are in either New England or New York City—appear to have more than enough Harvard recruitment resources. Other elite schools like the Groton School, a private boarding school in Massachusetts, enjoy the same advantages, yet four to five Harvard alumni travel to Groton each year to interview prospective students. This kind of effort should be made to recruit at underrepresented schools.
In part because of this, students from underrepresented schools have noted that their schools do not prepare them to apply to Harvard through Early Action (or even at all, because in-state scholarships are very attractive). To remedy this, Harvard needs to send more resources to locations that do not traditionally send students to Harvard, with particular emphasis on publicizing the University’s financial aid policy. Though Harvard’s recent recruitment efforts like Harvard College Connection are commendable, getting admissions officers to represent Harvard’s benefits (financial and otherwise) in person at these schools would be more effective than just keeping resources available online.
Further recruitment efforts can come from encouraging the establishment of Harvard clubs and other alumni organizations in parts of the country where fewer students apply to Harvard. This will help cull qualified applicants from these areas, and ameliorate cultural problems at school that arise from disproportionately drawing students from certain regions.
It is vital that Harvard makes these efforts to increase the presence of students from these underrepresented regions, as it has clear adverse effects on our community. Because students from New York or Boston often know classmates even before Opening Days, students from areas with few fellow students can sometimes feel isolated from the start, unable to participate in pre-set regional friend groups.
This regional disparity on campus and in social spaces encourages segregation along state lines, and getting more students from underrepresented places could help the issue. To improve geographic diversity and community cohesion on campus, we encourage Harvard to better its recruitment efforts in these areas.

One year ago, in “Dear Harvard, You Win,” a survivor of sexual violence gave a firsthand account of the betrayal she experienced at the hands of not only her perpetrator but also her school. That piece ignited a wave of attention toward the rights and treatment of sexual violence survivors at Harvard, inspiring the creation of two task forces and prompting the University to share plans for policy reform. One year later, it is time to revisit what has changed, and what hasn’t, for survivors on campus. No survivor should ever experience what the author of “Dear Harvard” went through—but unfortunately, far too many of the experiences outlined in that op-ed are still a risk because of remaining gaps and omissions in policy, procedures, and training.
The author of “Dear Harvard” was discouraged from pursuing an Ad Board case because her assault may not have met the standards in Harvard’s policy. This past summer saw the release of the first updated sexual assault policy for FAS in twenty years, a policy created without the inclusion of students’ perspectives in a process that left survivors largely voiceless. Sexual conduct violates the current policy if it is “unwelcome,” replacing the negative consent language of the old policy, but still resisting affirmative consent language. The policy acknowledges mental incapacitation as a barrier to welcomeness, but contains few explanations of otherwise ambiguous language.
Eight months after the announcement of the new policy, there has been minimal explanation of its interpretation and application, so it is unclear how another “Dear Harvard” case would fare under the new standards. The clarity of this policy is vitally important: We should not expect survivors to navigate a nebulous, legalese-ridden system that is impossible to understand. If the University insists on using a standard with which most students are unfamiliar (like welcomeness), they should explain the policy publicly and accessibly.
“Dear Harvard” also highlighted how important residential accommodations, like the removal of an assailant from the survivor’s house, are for many survivors to feel safe enough to live and learn on campus. If the author of “Dear Harvard” sought the removal of her perpetrator from her house today, that process would likely require filing a complaint with the seven-month-old, understaffed Office of Sexual and Gender Based Dispute Resolution.
During a formal complaint process, an ODR investigator conducts interviews, assembles evidence and makes a finding of fact using the preponderance of evidence standard, a major change from the old, ambiguous “sufficiently persuaded” standard that violated Title IX. After ODR’s finding of fact, however, the Ad Board still has full control over disciplinary measures. The Ad Board is not bound by guidelines for appropriate sanctioning, and its opaque data does not reveal which sanctions are applied to which kinds of sexual misconduct. This lack of transparency perpetuates serious concerns about how the Ad Board is handling cases given the critcism they have received in the past about their response to sexual violence.
In addition to residential accommodations, academic accommodations are important for ensuring survivors’ continued access to their educations. Academic accommodations like modifying course loads and rescheduling exams were accessible only through an Ad Board petition, which could only be brought to the Ad Board by the survivor’s resident dean. Others—extensions and rescheduling tests—depended on the goodwill of individual professors who were given no standardized policy for granting accomodations. Under the new policy, the ODR and the Title IX Coordinators are supposed to facilitate access, but these accommodations ultimately still hinge on the acquiescence of the professor or resident dean. The Title IX Coordinator still has no power to guarantee accommodations if a dean or professor resists helping a survivor access the accommodation they need to continue their education, and survivors still face dismissiveness from administrators who should be there to support them.
Harvard’s campus won’t be fair and safe for everyone until we have a clear and just policy, a transparent disciplinary process, and standardized access to critical residential and academic accommodations. Our new policy and procedures are a tentative step forward, but many important questions remain unanswered: What do the current standards actually mean? How will they be applied? Will they be adequate to address survivors’ needs? The handful of focus groups and open meetings this year that have served as the administration’s first steps towards student outreach must evolve into a concerted effort on the part of Harvard’s administration to involve survivors and students regularly, openly, and meaningfully in trainings and policy discussions. Despite forward movement, the words from “Dear Harvard” apply with as much force today as they did a year ago:
“We need more options for survivors...We need school officials to receive extensive training about how to handle sexual assault and talk to survivors. More importantly, we need the school to start listening to its students [and] to survivors.”

Harvard has authorized the formation of three new international offices in Cape Town, Beijing, and Mumbai, with each office in a different stage of development, according to Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Domínguez.
The Center for African Studies is expected to open an office in Cape Town, South Africa, by the end of 2015 or early 2016, according to Domínguez. An expected office in Beijing would  be connected to the existing Harvard Center Shanghai, and, if approved by the government of India, the Harvard School of Public Health will open an office in Mumbai. These offices would be used for research and academic work for Harvard affiliates in those regions.
These offices join 16 other offices Harvard operates internationally, including multiple Latin America-based offices of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, Business School locations across Asia, and the recently-opened Medical School research center in Dubai, among others. While the University has research centers and offices abroad, it does not, unlike some of its peers, have any international campuses.
Caroline Elkins, History professor and director of the existing Center for African Studies, will direct the center in Cape Town, although she will remain based in Cambridge.
“[The office in Cape Town] is most definitely imagined as being an engaging space for our students and faculty but also the broader community in Africa,” Elkins said, adding that she hopes the office will facilitate research in the region and offer students more study abroad opportunities.
The office in Beijing would be connected to the existing University-wide office in Shanghai and possibly serve a similar function; the Shanghai office includes a conference venue and facilitates internships for undergraduates.
“A lot of the work in China unavoidably requires interacting with the Chinese government, and that’s in Beijing,” Domínguez said, explaining the reason for the location of the planned center.
Domínguez said the proposed Indian office is in the earliest stages of development compared to the offices in China and South Africa. He said he hopes the Indian government will approve of the Harvard office in Mumbai this summer.
Proposals for new international offices must be brought to the University Committee on International Projects and Sites, which Domínguez chairs. Then, if that committee approves a potential office, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 must approve the plan.
Important to any given proposal is the academic rationale of the project, according to Domínguez.
“What is it about the office that we cannot just do it based in Cambridge, or in Boston?” Domínguez said. “What will it do for our students, what will it do for our faculty, in what way will it facilitate research that we can't just do from here?”
Although Domínguez does not know how many people will be employed in the Cape Town and Beijing offices, he estimated that number would be in the “one digit” range,  he wrote in an email.
Faculty members have praised University President Drew G. Faust’s efforts to expand Harvard’s international presence, most recently through her trip to China.
“[She’s] trying to present Harvard as a school with a global footprint,” said East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor Mark C. Elliott. Elliot recently accompanied Faust on her trip to China in March, where she met with Chinese President Xi Jinping to discuss universities’ roles in combating climate change and appeared at a “Your Harvard” alumni event.
In October, Faust traveled to Mexico, where she met with Harvard affiliates and hosted a well-attended alumni reception in Mexico City.
“Under President Faust, Harvard has become more intentionally global,” Elkins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing to engage with the College’s unrecognized social clubs, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana joined other administrators to meet with final club members on Monday, collectively offering them tips on hosting safe parties and information on Harvard’s sexual harassment policy.
Administrators from the Office of Student Life scheduled at least two meetings in the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Monday, one for affiliates of the College’s all-male final clubs from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and another for female final clubs and other social organizations from 8 to 9:30 p.m., according to meeting agendas obtained by The Crimson. The meeting for female and other social clubs went on until about 10 p.m., however.
Although Harvard does not recognize final clubs or Greek organizations, College administrators regularly hold meetings with these social club leaders. Monday’s set of meetings was at least the second this academic year and the second that Khurana personally attended as dean.
At Monday’s meetings, administrators addressed a series of topics, according to documents they handed out to attendees. History professor Alison F. Johnson, who led a faculty committee that updated the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Title IX procedures, attended the first meeting with male final club leaders, but not the one with female counterparts. She talked about the policy with attendees, she confirmed Tuesday.
“Since our new policy includes expectations that were, in some cases, less robustly articulated in the past, it is important that the FAS maximize people's exposure to those new policies,” Johnson wrote in an email.
The Offices of Alcohol and Other Drug Services and Sexual Assault Prevention and Response offered students tips on bystander intervention, safe drinking, and hazing prevention, according to one hand-out. It detailed suggestions for promoting “positive team building” and party tips, and advice listed included reducing the “power differential between established and new members,” inviting administrators to provide programming to club members, locking private rooms before parties, and informing club members of the College’s and Massachusetts's hazing policies.
The agendas of both meetings also detailed a review of resources available for club leaders.
Both agendas set time aside for a “conversation” with Khurana, who declined to comment on the meeting because he said he told attendees that their conversation would be considered confidential. At a similar meeting in October, Khurana asked unrecognized social club affiliates questions about diversity and exclusivity, engaging with the groups in a way that attendees said they had not seen before from administrators.
“He was really asking them to think about their own communities and what their values are and the degree to which they align or don't align with the mission of the College,” Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said in October.
These semiannual meetings are not the only way in which administrators engage with unrecognized social clubs. From informal lunches to conversations with club graduate board members, administrators maintain a relationship with unrecognized social groups.
Several male and female final club leaders either did not respond to or declined requests for comment on this story. Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich also declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While several students who have not yet finalized their summer plans said that they feel pressure searching for opportunities past the recruiting season in January and February, representatives from the Office of Career Services point out that many opportunities still remain.
Both Robin E. Mount, Director of Office of Career Services and International Programs, and Anthony J. Arcieri, Director of Undergraduate Career Advising and Programming, acknowledged this pressure. They said that although it sometimes seems like many students finalize their plans as early as January and February, it is common for students to find opportunities later in the year.
“Sometimes people think that ‘Oh, everything is over!’ after [January and February], but in fact I think that when we look at data, the majority of students, especially freshmen and sophomores, land things around April,” Mount said.
Arcieri said that many organizations have later timelines for their hiring processes if their needs for the summer are uncertain.
“I think at Harvard, we tend to a little bit of an earlier approach and oftentimes I think students want to have things lined up earlier, but sometimes some industries don’t necessarily operate that early,” said Arcieri.
Leah N. Schwartz ’16 said that she is still waiting to hear back from the global health-related programs to which she has applied.
“You feel the pressure as everyone is accepting offers in February…but once that initial rush of offers was accepted and things calm down, I was fine also. I kind of just waited,” Schwartz said.
Aidan R. Chavez ’18, a student from Los Angeles, is in the midst of looking for summer internships near home.
“It’s a little scary and you feel kind of left out and that you’re not doing what you’re supposed to be doing, but overall it’s okay,” Chavez said.
Chavez said that he has sought the help of OCS during his search. He attended OCS’s summer opportunities drop-ins last Friday which, according to Arcieri, drew 64 students in total.
OCS has, in the past few weeks, also hosted events specifically addressing these students’ worries. Mount said that more than 70 students attended OCS’s event entitled “It’s Not Too Late to Plan For Summer” last Thursday.
Mount also added that various consortium databases, such as the iNet Internship Network and UCAN: The University Career Action Network, are helpful tools to search for internships near their hometowns.
Mount added that despite students’ worries, “some of the coolest things show up at the last minute.”
Of the students, she said, “they’re like cats, they land on their feet.”

In what Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow described as a “very unusual event,” University President Drew G. Faust and visiting Law School professor Leon Wieseltier discussed the status of intellectualism and the humanities Tuesday night.
The discussion, held in a question and answer format between Faust and Wieseltier as well as members of the crowd at Wasserstein Hall on the Law School campus, revolved around the potentially corruptive influence of technology on public thought.
“What we really have to think about is the impact of this technology on cognition and on consciousness and on culture,” said Wieseltier, who is also a fellow at the Brookings Institute, a think tank.
Wieseltier tied “the tyranny of the devices” and the rise of “snackable” reading to what he described as the decline of the humanities.
“In an academic setting, as far as I’m concerned, this comes to a fight for the humanities,” Wieseltier said.
For her part, Faust posited that the role of higher education is to encourage more long-term, substantial thinking.
“I wonder if the part of the responsibility of the university is to nurture sustained attention,” Faust said.
Wieseltier also discussed the shake-up of the New Republic, for which he was formerly an editor, and the future of journalism during the discussion. Last year, after a change in management and editorial decisions, a flood of editors and writers for the magazine left the publication in protest.
“I’m happy to see that the collapse of my magazine was a moment in our culture. The solidarity that I and my colleagues experienced was breathtaking. The event was heartbreaking, but the consolation was the sense that the people understood the principles,” Wieseltier said.
He added that, while the business model for longer-form, in-depth writing might be in trouble,this form of writing remains necessary.
“The need for extended serious conceptual and scholarly analysis has never been greater,” he said. “And the terrible thing is that the economic and technical pressures on the institutions of deliberative thinking have also never been greater. And I worry about that a lot.”
Wieseltier undertook graduate studies at Harvard and was a junior member of the Harvard Society of Fellows.

A record-low 5.3 percent of applicants were offered admission to Harvard College’s Class of 2019, when the University announced on Tuesday that it had accepted 1,990 of 37,305 applicants.
A total of 1,013 students were greeted with congratulatory messages when they logged into their admissions portals at 5 p.m. Tuesday, joining the 977 students who were admitted to the class through the College’s restrictive early action program. Including the 4,292 students who were deferred from the early action applicant pool, the regular admission rate was 2.8 percent this year, also down from last year’s rate of 3.1 percent.
Instead of sending admissions notifications via email, as in past years, the Admissions Office asked students to log in to an online portal to learn whether or not they had been admitted. Applicants also received emails indicating when their admissions decisions were available to view online.
Fifty-two percent of admitted students are male, creating a slight gender imbalance in the incoming class that Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 attributed to the fact that more men than women applied to the College this round. However, Fitzsimmons said, women were accepted at a slightly higher rate than men.
“We certainly were aware of and were trying to attract more women, and I think with some success,” he said. “This year women [got] in at a slightly higher rate. They did so because in the competition they stood out.”
Fifty-five percent of students admitted to the Class of 2018 last year were male.
The pool of admitted students also represents small increases in diversity, with 13.3 percent and 12.1 percent of admitted students identifying as Latino and African American, respectively. Twenty-one percent of admitted students identify as Asian American, up from 19.7 percent last year. Two percent identify as Native American or Native Hawaiian.
The percentage of accepted international students increased slightly to 10.8 percent, up from 10.5 percent of students admitted to the Class of 2018, and 7.7 percent of accepted students are U.S. dual citizens.
Fitzsimmons said targeted outreach efforts to low-income and minority students may have helped attract a more diverse pool of applicants this year. Sixty-two percent of all admitted students and 80 percent of admitted minority students—including 87 percent of Latinos and 86 percent of African-Americans—appeared on College Board and ACT search lists that Harvard uses to identify potentially qualified applicants from diverse backgrounds, according to Fitzsimmons.
“We’ve been very careful to make sure that this is a good list,” Fitzsimmons said Tuesday. “It’s counterproductive for us to encourage people into the pool who don’t have a chance of getting in.”
A greater proportion of admitted students indicated that they intend to concentrate in the social sciences and humanities while at Harvard than their counterparts last year, at 26 percent and 15 percent this year, respectively. Six percent of admitted students cited Computer Science as their intended concentration.
The Admissions Office staff celebrated the Class of 2019 with pancakes, French toast, and champagne after mailing boxes of acceptance letters on Tuesday.
Visitas—Harvard’s spring visiting weekend for accepted students—is scheduled for April 25-27, and Harvard anticipates that 1,200 or more students will attend, according to a press release. Admitted students have until May 1 to accept their offers of admission.
The seven other Ivy League schools also released their admissions decisions on Tuesday. Yale’s admissions rate rose to 6.5 percent this year, and Cornell’s rose to 14.9 percent. Columbia accepted 6.1 percent of applicants, while Princeton accepted 7 percent and Brown 8.5 percent, all decreases from last year. The University of Pennsylvania accepted 9.9 percent.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven attended The Crimson’s interview with Fitzsimmons. The interview and early access to admissions statistics were granted on the condition that The Crimson not publish them until late Tuesday night.

UPDATED: April 1, 2015, at 5:53 p.m.
The total cost of attending Harvard College will break $60,000 for the first time in its history. Including tuition, room, board, and other fees, the cost will increase 3.5 percent to $60,659 for the 2015-2016 academic year.
Continuing a long-term trend, the increases outpace the United States inflation rate. The total cost of attending the College was $58,607 for the 2014-2015 academic year, a 3.9 percent increase from that of the previous year—the largest increase in at least the last eight years.
Tuition, meanwhile, will increase by 3 percent to $41,632.
However, the College projects that more than half of the Class of 2019 will receive need-based aid, as the College offers financial aid through the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. Launched by former University President Lawrence H. Summers in 2004, the initiative begins its 12th academic year in the fall.
Families making under $65,000 annually—about 20 percent of families—are not expected to contribute to the cost of attending the College.
According to Sally C. Donahue, the Griffin Director of Financial Aid, most families on financial aid pay an average of 10 percent of their income. Donahue said in a press release that families receiving aid will pay $12,000 annually on average.
Financial aid is also one of the largest priorities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s $2.5 billion portion of the Harvard capital campaign. FAS aims to raise $600 million for financial aid in its campaign.
In February 2014, the University announced that it had received a $150 million donation from hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, at least $125 million of which would go toward financial aid scholarships in his name. The Office of Financial Aid was also renamed in Griffin’s honor.
Neither FAS Dean Michael D. Smith nor FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 was available for comment.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will serve as the ex officio chair of the College’s Honor Council, which will adjudicate cases of academic dishonesty next year, and has had conversations with faculty members about potentially serving on the body.
Khurana also chairs the College’s Administrative Board, which currently hears cheating cases.
The College’s first honor code, which the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved last May, will go into effect next fall. A student-faculty body composed of 12 undergraduates and 12 other members that may include faculty, staff, and teaching fellows, will hear cases of alleged violations of the policy. The College named the 12 undergraduates who will sit on the Council in mid-March.
In an interview Tuesday, Khurana said he hopes to formally appoint the second half of the student-faculty judicial body by the end of the summer.
“I’ve spoken to a variety of different people regarding the Honor Council,” he said. “The approach that our office takes is we try not to make everything set in stone,” he later added when prompted on additional details.
Since appointed to positions on the Council, undergraduate members have been attending weekly training sessions featuring discussions of mock cases.
In the Honor Council’s first training session, Khurana spoke to undergraduates. He wrote in an email last week that he “described the College’s mission” and “asked the students to share [ideas] for strengthening the culture of academic integrity and how we could support their work.”
Honor Council member Nathaniel R. F. Bernstein ’17 said last week that the Council was “very charged up” by Khurana’s talk.
The Faculty are expected to vote on the affirmation of integrity statement portion of the honor code at its next meeting on April 7. If approved in the form recently distributed to faculty members, students would be required to sign a statement affirming their “awareness of” the honor code when they register and on final exams, projects, and papers.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokespeople Anna Cowenhoven and Rachael Dane attended The Crimson’s interview with Khurana.

Boston 2024 representatives addressed more than 200 residents from the Greater Boston area Tuesday regarding the city’s bid to host the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Attendees raised concerns about financial transparency and community tradeoffs, among other issues.
This meeting was the third of nine monthly community meetings that invite the public to discuss the potential impact of the Games on the city. The meetings are hosted by Boston 2024, the group promoting the city’s bid.
Nikko Mendoza, vice president of engagement and external affairs for Boston 2024, said during the meeting that the bid would advance only in the case of support from a majority of Massachusetts residents. A Massachusetts referendum in 2016 will determine public support.
A number of residents expressed concerns about the possibility of hosting the Games in Boston. Residents mentioned what they called suspect financial accounting, financial tradeoffs with state funds for public schools, the impact on affordable housing and homelessness rates, the lack of a line item for the renovation of public spaces, and a lack of transparency throughout the Olympic bid process. Additionally, the lack of information on the Game’s funding through public-private partnerships left citizens feeling anxious, they said.
Boston Redevelopment Authority product manager John Fitzgerald said that even though the City of Boston is “getting smarter about venues” as it conducts more research and evaluations, he identified continued concerns about environmental, fiscal, and social sustainability, as well as public transit for Boston 2024.
Fitzgerald said that the total budget for the Games was $9.1 billion. For comparison, London had originally budgeted $4.4 billion for the 2012 Olympics; ultimately the London Olympics cost over three times that initial estimate.
Fitzgerald also said the initial Boston proposal does not include plans for a traditional centralized Olympic sports campus. Rather, the BRA and Boston 2024 expect to take advantage of Boston’s existing transportation infrastructure.
“We want to make the games the most walkable and accessible games ever,” Fitzgerald said.
Fitzgerald also emphasized the importance of the cooperation of universities in the Greater Boston area. Among other local universities, Harvard is included in plans as a host for Olympic events.
Mendoza said that despite the organization’s hope to engage the community, Boston 2024 now recognizes that they have not yet done so sufficiently.
The potential for a lack of support threatens the viability of Boston’s hosting the 2024 Games. While Boston has already been selected as the United States’ bid, Olympic officials have spoken with Los Angeles and San Francisco about the feasibility of reviving bids from those cities in the case that Boston’s bid does not go forward.

UPDATED: April 1, 2015, at 3:30 a.m.
At a panel Tuesday afternoon in Boylston Hall, Jesselyn A. Radack and Walt L. Tamosaitis shared their experiences as whistleblowers and pointed to exposing institutional misconduct as an important method for confronting injustice.
A former worker at the Department of Justice Ethics Office, Radack is now the national security and human rights director for the Government Accountability Project and an attorney who counts National Security Agency whistleblowers Edward J. Snowden and Thomas Drake among her clients. She became known as a whistleblower in 2002 for her disclosure of what she called an ethics violation in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s interrogation of John Walker Lindh, which occurred without an attorney present.
“For me, it wasn’t about John Walker Lindh, per se, I wasn’t his lawyer, but it was about the fact that we’re the Justice Department and we can’t cheat,” Radack said.
Tamosaitis, who worked as a systems engineer for a Bechtel subcontractor on the Hanford Nuclear Site, became known for speaking out against his company when he raised safety concerns about the construction of the site.
Both Radack and Tamosaitis said that, in their experiences, becoming a whistleblower was not so much a conscious decision as it was a result of their frustration with perceived injustices in their workplaces.
In an interview before the event, Center for Public Interest Careers director Travis A. Lovett said that his group, which sponsored the event, has put together various seminars on topics relevant to public service careers but that whistleblowing was an area that the center had never before discussed in a public forum.
“We thought that this, from the professional development standpoint, is something worth highlighting for students, that they might not be getting from the classroom,” Lovett said.
The panel was part of the “American Whistleblower Tour: Essential Voices for Accountability” sponsored by the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower protection agency. At Harvard, the panel was co-sponsored by Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and the Center for Public Interest Careers. The moderator of the panel was Dana Gold, tour director of the GAP’s American Whistleblower Campaign.

Before 5 p.m. Tuesday, Rita W. Wang—a high school student from Edison, N.J—was having a bit of a rough day.
That morning, she crashed her car into a street sign in her neighborhood (“just cosmetic damage,” she said). Later, struggling to focus at school, she forgot to fill out the back page of a test. Thinking that her bad luck would continue to her college admissions decisions, she bought herself a dollar ice cream cone from Baskin-Robbins and awaited her fate in front of her computer.
But at 5 p.m. that evening, Wang started to refresh the Harvard admissions portal—and saw that she had been accepted to the Class of 2019.
“I had my ice cream with me when I checked the decision, and I kept refreshing the page until I saw the acceptance,” she said. “I was really confused, like did the server crash again?”
Wang joined 1,013 other students admitted to Harvard’s Class of 2019 via regular decision, capping an admissions season that saw a record-low 5.3 percent acceptance rate. Although she has not yet told her father about the car damage, she said she hopes that her Harvard acceptance might smooth over the news.
Across the Atlantic, Tess W. Jacobson from Bridgewater, N.J., was in Spain for spring break when she received her decision. Jacobson said that she spent the day visiting museums and watching “Adventure Time” to distract herself, but admitted that when she saw another tourist in a Harvard sweatshirt she “almost had a heart attack.”
Decisions arrived in Spain at 11 p.m. local time, but Jacobson said that she avoided telling her family because she was expecting to be disappointed.
“Then the page loaded and I screamed outside for, like, 10 full minutes,” she said.
Brianna A. Oppong-Antwi of Wrightsville, Pa., had a particularly busy Tuesday, having applied to all eight Ivy League universities and over 20 colleges total. Oppong-Antwi said that she tried to treat Ivy Day—when all Ivy League schools release their decisions simultaneously—like “just a normal day."
“Then around 4:45 I opened every tab on my computer with the Ivy portals that they gave me,” she said. “When it said ‘congrats on Harvard,’ I started crying, and my brother thought that I didn’t get in or I was in pain or something.”
Oppong-Antwi called Harvard her “dream school.”
All of the prospective students interviewed said that they were excited to attend Visitas, Harvard’s visiting weekend for admitted students, to be held April 25-27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 1, 2015, at 1:20 a.m.
Men’s hockey standout forward Jimmy Vesey announced his intent to return to Harvard for his senior season on Tuesday.
In a press conference Saturday after Nebraska-Omaha eliminated the Crimson from the NCAA tournament, Vesey said that he would talk to Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 and his parents about his opportunity to sign with the National Hockey League’s Nashville Predators. On Tuesday, he informed the Predators that he would exercise his final season of NCAA eligibility.
“I just felt that there were a lot of reasons to come back to Harvard,” Vesey said on Tuesday. “To give up a Harvard degree would be a really tough thing to do for me. I also feel that we’re going to be one of the top teams in the country next year.”
Vesey leads Division I men’s college hockey in goals scored this season. His 32 goals this year are more than any other Harvard player has scored in 24 seasons. In the ECAC tournament last month, Vesey scored a playoff-record nine goals as Harvard earned its first conference championship since 2006.
Last week, Vesey became the 11th Crimson player to win the Walter Brown Award, a 63-year-old annual award that recognizes the best American-born college hockey player in New England. He is one of 10 finalists for the Hobey Baker Memorial Award, given to the nation’s top college player.
On Saturday, he recorded the Crimson’s lone goal in the team’s last game of the season—a 4-1 loss to Omaha in the Midwest Regional semifinal in South Bend, Ind. Following the loss, Vesey was unusually emotional, fighting back tears at the postgame press conference. On Tuesday, he said that he wanted to use his senior year to get “one last crack at” a Frozen Four run.
“I’d like to be a part of another great season of Harvard hockey, and I just felt like that was in my heart,” Vesey said.
With his decision, the Crimson may return in the fall with all 12 forwards who played in the ECAC championship game. Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo, who skated on the first line with Vesey this year, expressed his excitement about Vesey’s announcement.
“I think we realized how much dedication and hard work goes into winning a championship for the ECAC,” Criscuolo said. “Having all the forwards back is huge for us next year in terms of experience, and that will help us in our goal of returning to the NCAA tournament.”
Nashville selected Vesey with the 66th overall pick in the third round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft prior to the Charlestown native’s arrival at Harvard. With four full games left in their regular season, the Predators are currently first in the NHL’s Central Division and have already qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs.
Vesey said that Nashville respected his decision to remain amateur.
“I think [the Predators organization] would have liked to have had me on for the rest of the regular season in Nashville and for the playoff run that they make, but they were understanding that a Harvard degree is something that is really important to me and my family,” Vesey said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its home opener, the Harvard softball team mercy-ruled Rhode Island (1-20) in back-to-back games on Tuesday afternoon at Soldiers Field. After going 1-3 in two sets of Ivy League doubleheaders over the weekend, the Crimson hitters bounced back strongly against the Rams, combining for 29 runs over the course of two games.
The Harvard offense has been on fire as of late, as this set of double-digit games comes two days after the Crimson racked up 14 runs against Penn in its last game.
HARVARD 14, RHODE ISLAND 3
After falling behind 1-0 in the first inning, Harvard barraged the Rams for 11 runs in the second inning. It was the first time this season that the Crimson put up double-digit runs in a single inning.
“It was great to be able to pass the bat for that long,” junior pitcher Morgan Groom said. “We had a lot of people stay focused during their at-bats.”
Sophomore infielder Catherine Calloway led off the inning with a solo shot, and the hits kept coming from there.  Later that inning, freshman Maddy Kaplan singled to drive in two more runs. The Crimson racked up eight hits on their way to batting around the order one and a half times.
“It’s definitely a confidence booster, especially when we’ve been putting everyone in and we still are producing the runs we need,” Groom added.
Senior Emily Gusse led the Crimson with four RBIs for the game. She is currently the team’s leading run producer with 15 RBIs on the season.
Sophomore pitcher Taylor Cabe started the game for Harvard. She gave up a lone RBI double to the Ram’s junior Lauren Klepchick in the top of the first. Cabe picked up her second win of the season.
She was relieved by junior Gabrielle Ruiz, who finished the game with two innings, giving up two runs on four hits.
“Our fielding and pitching were solid,” said Groom. We played really well on the field. We got it done. It was a pretty simple. “
HARVARD 15, RHODE ISLAND 0
In the first game of the doubleheader, the Crimson never looked back from an early 9-0 lead that it gained in the bottom of the first inning. Captain Laura Ricciardone and Groom combined for a three-hit shutout as Harvard went on to win by its largest margin of the season.
The game broke wide open in the bottom of the first, when freshman Alexa Altchek ripped a bases-loaded double into center field, scoring all three runners. Altchek, who came in as a pinch runner earlier that inning, went 3-for-3 and led the Crimson with five RBIs.
“The freshmen just came in and did really well today,” Groom said. “Alexa [Altchek] roped the ball today, which was great to see. [Freshman] Melissa [Lacro] hit some ropes too. I don’t think it is represented in her hits, but she hit some shots right at people.”
Ricciardone and Groom returned to last season’s form, when Harvard’s pitching staff led the Ivy League in ERA. Ricciardone started and struck out six, while walking none, in three innings of work. She earned her sixth win of the season.
Groom came in to finish the job. pitching two perfect innings as the game was cut short due to the 10-run mercy rule.
Rhode Island, which has faced many injuries in their pitching staff this season, was forced to put two position players, junior Kayla Cruz and junior Olivia Hendricks on the mound.
Cruz pitched two-thirds of an inning and gave up seven earned runs. Hendricks finished the game out giving up eight earned runs in three and a third innings pitched. The team only has two pitchers active on its roster.
The win was a statement to how much the Crimson have improved throughout the course of the young season. At the beginning of the year it was struggling often to score, but the runs have been coming in droves of late.
“I think everyone is confident and walks with a swagger that they didn’t have before, and that’s good to see,” junior utility player Haley Davis said.

Attention, freshmen: Advising Fortnight has officially begun. You may be confused as to what the event actually is, besides the subject of countless emails you have deleted without reading. Luckily, Flyby has done the research for you -- so here is everything you need to know about Advising Fortnight:
1. What is it?
According to the program’s website, the Advising Fortnight is your “Gateway to the 48” concentrations that Harvard offers undergraduates. Not only is it a way for you to get more information about concentrations you are considering, but also a chance to meet faculty and upperclassmen associated with the different concentrations.
2. What are “Advising Conversations”?
“Advising conversations” is an umbrella term for any meeting or event you go to for a potential concentration. This includes office hours, as well as any of the ice cream socials, lunches, and get-togethers hosted by concentrations.
3. I’m really busy. What happens if I don’t go?
According to the Advising Fortnight website, you are required to participate in one “advising conversation” and record it in the Advising Network Portal. (All you have to do is check a box saying what you attended, and include a few short notes about who you spoke to and what you learned from the conversation.) The website does not say what happens if you do not submit at least one conversation to the ANP, but freshmen should keep in mind that thinking about potential concentrations is an important thing as the school year comes to a close, and the entire process of having and recording a conversation doesn’t need to take more than 20 minutes (or heck, even 5 minutes) out of your day.
