After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this point, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that when elections go against the powerful, they try to change the elections themselves. But it’s a little shocking to see that happening at our own university.
This month the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers — the University’s highest- and second-highest governing bodies, respectfully — approved rules dictating that of 30 available seats, a maximum of six candidates nominated by petition can concurrently serve on the University's Board of Overseers. The new regulation comes conspicuously after Harvard Forward led a successful petition-based campaign, nominating five and electing three to the Board. Harvard Forward notably championed young alumni representation and fossil fuel divestment among other progressive initiatives to which the University has been resistant.
Limiting petition-nominated candidates is both procedurally wrong and substantively harmful. It is unfortunate and saddening that Harvard has decided to, once again, handicap non-endorsed candidates following a successful and, in our opinion, well-run petition — with divestment, unsurprisingly, again playing a central role. In the 1980s, after petition candidates who championed divestment from apartheid South Africa were elected to the Board of Overseers, including Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, Harvard tightened petition procedures.
The current policy in question was originally recommended by the specially-convened Election Working Group. The working group regards its recommendations as safeguards for “sustain[ing] and strengthen[ing] the sound and effective governance of the University.” We, however, don’t buy that good governance is somehow out of line with democratic procedures.
The Board of Overseers, as Harvard’s second-highest governing body, is most notably responsible for reviewing and assessing the University. Given these responsibilities, the working group reasoned that the Overseers must be “active, engaged, and questioning, rather than simply reactive or overly deferential.” The working group also concerningly avers that petition-nominated candidates are “members of issue-driven caucuses, sponsored by advocacy groups” and will fail to understand and consider “the Board’s distinctive responsibilities and needs.”
We do not question the significant role and responsibilities of Overseers, nor the “substantial time and care” invested in endorsing a diverse slate of accomplished and trusted individuals. But why do these factors warrant the nominating committee’s outsized (and now growing) control over the election process?
If the essence of the Board is truly “ensuring that Harvard as a whole will continue to thrive in pursuing its expansive and multifaceted mission of education and research in service of the larger society,” the University must be open to different views on how larger society can be served. Students, faculty members, and evidently alumni (given the election) all seem to believe that climate change should be a priority for Harvard. Given its prevalence, shouldn’t that perspective factor into how the Board oversees the University?
If past Board elections have been hotly politicized, we believe it is due to sincere, albeit heated, disagreements on how to best serve Harvard, rather than bitter partisanship or designs of sabotage. Petition candidates actually do the great service of broadening and challenging the way the Board and perhaps the community more broadly thinks about the roles, responsibilities, and operations of the University.
There is a legitimate need for dedicated and capable Overseers. But instead of limiting legitimate petitions, Harvard should regulate the nature of petition campaigns. The working group might consider limits on funding, campaign transparency policies, or professional prerequisites and demonstration of prior commitment from the candidates.
Beyond that, we should trust that Harvard degree holders — quite literally the electorate — are competent enough to vote with prudence and integrity. If we don’t, then what are we doing here anyway? Seriously?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a group of about 15 kids having dinner by the Charles River. They were around my age and, as I imagined, probably also Harvard students. They were packed closely together — shoulders touched and hands brushed past each other as cups were filled up and distributed. As one kid cracked a joke, collective laughter traveled out onto the street.
In the past, I probably would’ve smiled, maybe even waved or chirped a quiet “hello,” upon passing by. But, times have changed. The first thing that I noticed about the group wasn’t its members’ laughter or free spirits, but their large number and close proximity to one another. Most of the students’ masks were strewn to the sides of their faces or, in some cases, nowhere in sight. I grimaced but, unsure of what I could do, continued along on my walk.
Later that day, I saw some of those kids again. This time, though, it wasn’t in person — it was online. Someone had posted an Instagram story of them, again not social distancing. The post, whose caption read “exposed” and included the names of each person in the photo, was now circulating across several Harvard group chats.
I had seen these types of posts before — they’ve become exceedingly common in college communities as of late. I generally thought little of them, but this Instagram story struck me — after all, just earlier that day, I would have been perfectly positioned to create a nearly identical post.
But should I have? During the pandemic, when group gatherings like these are no longer innocent portraits of happiness and glee, but are oftentimes dangerous, what does accountability look like? Admittedly, I should have done something when I saw those kids — something beyond walking away. Passivity is never ideal. That said, “exposing” these students online also isn’t a productive approach.
Effectively holding other students accountable — especially now — is a difficult balancing act. On one hand, we can’t afford to be so lenient that we risk passively enabling their deleterious behavior. But on the other, we also need to extend some degree of sympathy towards students’ inevitably human attempts to grasp onto normalcy of some form. We must be both vigilant and introspective in deciding how we choose to hold others accountable.
We must predicate our approach on the understanding that public shaming lacks social productivity. Shame, unlike other emotions of self-conscious affect like guilt and embarrassment, is self-focused. Whereas guilt, for instance, is rooted in the realization that you’ve done something “bad,” the experience of shame is a result of the belief that you are fundamentally bad. Shame thus clouds the idea that we can improve and do better. The experience is inherently reductive.
Shame doesn’t just stifle meaningful change — it can also brew counterproductive thoughts and patterns of behavior. When we experience shame, our limbic systems bring our bodies into fight-or-flight mode, which can cause us to engage in a defense mechanism known as “armoring-up.” During this self-protective process, our feelings of shame and worthlessness swiftly morph into convictions of moral superiority and righteousness. Essentially, convinced that we cannot change and lacking any other defenses, we work to persuade ourselves that we were “right” all along.
Still, some might contest that, while shame itself is an unproductive tool, the fear of being shamed — of having your risky behaviors photographed and shared — is a preventative force too powerful to disregard. Such fear, though, would likely only prompt dissenters to transfer their risky behaviors to more private settings.
So, shaming clearly isn’t the answer. Neither, though, is looking the other way. How, then, should we work to hold our peers accountable? Ideally, our approach should be direct but remain compassionate. We should candidly express our concerns, but our words should remain unblemished by anger or blame. We should engage empathically and assume best intentions.
Now, admittedly, this is a highly romanticized set of principles, glorious in theory but ridden with practical ambiguities. Candidly expressing my concerns to those students back at the Charles River, for instance, would have been a daunting, emotionally demanding task — one that I’m still not sure I’d feel comfortable taking on.
The most straightforward option would have been to lean into that discomfort anyway — to have approached the group. I could have given them that smile, wave, or “hello” chirp that, just a year ago, I would have offered in an instant. Then, I could’ve tried to find out more about the context of the gathering — were they all members of the same social pod, for example?
Hopefully, following this chatter, any skeptical faces would have softened. Shoulders would have relaxed. I’d feel a wave of confidence and I’d ride on it. “By the way, does anyone want an extra mask?” may have been one strategic ask. While the potential approaches are endless and highly situational, they should all aim to make self-reflection — and reassessment of ideals — not only possible but appealing. They should aim to provoke thought and invite change.
But, no strategy is fool-proof. I could have approached the students on the Charles and been ostracized. I could have been dismissed. Eyes may have rolled, shoulders — still touching — may have tensed, and masks may have remained pushed aside.
What then? I have no plain answer, and looking for one would require a distorted abstraction of life’s complexities. Maybe we allow ourselves to give up. Maybe we try a little harder. Maybe we offer educational resources, or maybe we try to augment our reasoning with some sort of emotional appeal. But hopefully we don’t get frustrated and just snap a photo.
In whatever approach we pursue, we should reject the impulse to draw upon shame as a weapon. Shame doesn’t just blunt growth — it’s also inherently antithetical to change. At best, attempting to use it as an accountability tool is ineffective. At worst, it can kindle and cement harmful views. We shouldn’t let this approach guide our actions anywhere — not in public, not online, and certainly not on the Charles River.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I once jumped out of a plane, falling freely, briefly terrified, immersed in a cushion of air, an unparalleled view of the ground, my parachute firmly in place.
An entanglement of unrivaled freedom, risk, and fear makes free-fall exhilarating: defying convention, embracing the moment, while knowing the odds favor your landing safely.
Over the past two weeks, I have spoken with seven different students on leave this fall, plunging headfirst into their own state of “free fall.” They are among the 20 percent of Harvard students who decided to not enroll this term. Once you hear their stories, you may want to take the plunge this spring, too.
Jacob R. Jimenez ’23 logs onto our Zoom call a few minutes late. Just back from the Saturday market, his sole opportunity to leave the idyllic organic farm he’s been working on in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Jimenez described the strange paradox of his freedom. On the one hand, he has no car, shaky wifi, and is geographically restricted. On the other, he feels a newfound “intellectual freedom and mental health freedom not to worry about the due dates of tomorrow and the assignments of tomorrow.”
As Jimenez spends his days weeding, mulching, and seeding new plants; Michael Montella ’21 is digging his hands into U.S. politics — fighting for democracy and the freedoms it entails. A virtual organizer for the Iowa democrats, Montella said, “I just cannot imagine a 45-year-old self of my mind looking back and be like, I did not do everything that I possibly could to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and other Democrats in this consequential election.”
North of where Montella and friends are living in Nantucket, Nuri Bhuiyan ’22, a Crimson Arts editor, is literally sketching blueprints for social justice in upstate New York. In addition to a film internship, she told me she is researching “how a lot of spaces are default built for white people” and “experimenting with medium to explore this concept of what it looks like for Black Americans to take up space.”
A similar entrepreneurial fervor can be found in Mia C. Johansson ’22, who is “coding all the time” in her new off-campus apartment in Cambridge. In high school, Mia founded The Teen Magazine, a site with almost 600 student writers who submit content and offer peer feedback. Having leaped from 20,000 to 70,000 monthly pageviews since the pandemic’s onset, Mia is seizing this momentum. Free from schoolwork but not from responsibility, Johansson described her decision as “scary.”
“For the first time in my life, I'm deciding my own goals, I'm setting what success looks like,” Johansson said. “And I'm having to keep myself accountable for staying on track.”
These four students are not the only ones diving into new learning experiences: Yeokyeong “YK” Kim ’23 has just moved from Pennsylvania to Korea for a digital marketing internship; Henry Kuo ’23 has enrolled in not-for-credit hardware courses at National Taipei University; Guillermo S. Hava ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor originally from Spain, is tackling Italian while working in Rome.
One way or another though, “free-falling” students remain connected to the Harvard community, through overactive email lists, professors, alumni, webinars, or — as has become pervasive — student organizations; involvement during these times seemingly overrides compliance with the College’s ban on unenrolled students participating in campus clubs. Students on leave are often still vital to the institutional knowledge of our clubs, enriching the lives of those enrolled. Even if the policy had a coherent logic in past years, it would appear unnecessarily harsh and isolating during times that are harsh and isolating enough.
“I’ve loved the response from clubs and groups to be really supportive. Harvard people, like the rest of the world, have grown and become more human, and it feels good,” Bhuiyan shared.
Of course, this sample of students is just that: a sample. Some students taking time off may possess the privilege of having no concrete plans, others may be taking time to financially support their families. Conversely, the pandemic posed significant economic and relational challenges for my family, making Harvard a much-needed haven.
Montella described his time working on the election as a welcome opportunity to “recalibrate.”
“There were also just like a lot of things that I wanted to do before college ended, like certain travel and just kind of having the time to recalibrate and think about what I would like to get out of my life, rather than just sort of mindlessly going through the Harvard lazy river,” he said.
Similarly, Kim craves an opportunity to reflect on her first year at Harvard and take a break to “reassess” and “fully understand” her own needs and wants before getting back on campus.
She added, “With a lot of my friends that I've talked to, if we kind of reflect on first semester and second semester, we weren't doing as well as we tried to tell ourselves that we were doing.”
The thrill of being busy is an adrenaline rush for many of us, but when this is all we ever know, it can become a problem.
My brother, Jasper Johnston ’20, who graduated this past spring, once said, “Time at Harvard flies like an ant walking down the aisle of a jumbo jet — each foot takes forever but suddenly it's a hundred miles from where it started.”
Free-falling students remind us that to truly understand Harvard’s unique laws of time, motion, and gravity, and how these forces influence each of us for better or for worse, sometimes we have to get off the aircraft completely. Students leaping into the unknown, falling away from academia, are grounding themselves, putting their Harvard experience, in all of its small, peculiar and arbitrary glory, into perspective, while relying on their vital sources of communal support as parachutes to soften their landings.
I once jumped out of a plane, falling freely, briefly terrified, immersed in a cushion of air, an unparalleled view of the ground, my parachute firmly in place. I might just try it again this spring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard libraries will resume BorrowDirect services and expand the number of collections available for scan-and-deliver services and pick-up at Lamont Library, research librarians Anna Assogba and Fred Burchsted announced in a Friday email to students, staff, and faculty.
Library users can now request materials for Lamont pick-up or scan-and-deliver from the Frances Loeb Library of the School of Design, Tozzer Anthropology Library, Ernst Mayr Library in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the Divinity and Law School libraries, among others. Materials housed in Widener Library, Lamont Library, and the Harvard Depository have been available since June 30.
Only books which are unavailable through the temporary emergency access portal offered by HathiTrust — a multi-university digital library — are available for Harvard pickup. Burchsted and Assogba wrote in June that HathiTrust emergency access will likely remain available until library collections across the nation reopen.
In their Friday email, Assogba and Burchsted warned that some BorrowDirect requests may be fulfilled slower than normal because not all libraries in the BorrowDirect system have reopened yet. BorrowDirect is a system that lets affiliates of any of the Ivy League schools and a few others borrow books from the others’ libraries.
The University’s larger “interlibrary loan” service, which lets Harvard affiliates borrow materials from a wide range of libraries within and outside the Ivy League, has not yet resumed, Burchsted and Assogba wrote.
In addition to the expanded loan options, Harvard Library users can also request that the library make book purchases again — but only in urgent cases. Burchsted and Assogba wrote that the libraries will decide these requests on a case-by-case basis.
Harvard’s libraries closed in March, during the same week that most Harvard students were sent away from campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late June, the libraries began the first phase of their reopening plan. At the time, they resumed some scan-and-deliver and pickup services, and returned some staff to on-site work.
University Librarian Martha Whitehead said in an early June interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that libraries would resume physical access for users “further down the road, as circumstances allow for greater population density.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 30, 2020, 3:30 p.m.
After hearing allegations that Government instructor David D. Kane authored racist blog posts, Maria Keselj ’23 took to TikTok to condemn the blog posts as endorsing bigotry and white supremacy.
Keselj’s Saturday post on the popular video sharing app had racked up more than one hundred thousand views as of Sunday evening.
Keselj is one of dozens of Kane’s students enrolled in Harvard’s Government 50: “Data” course that have reacted to the allegations with an outpouring of rage and shock.
Students alleged that Kane authored the posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog and found that “Field” authored a post on the blog in 2014 that was signed “David Kane ’88.” Kane is a 1988 graduate of Williams College and founded EphBlog in 2003.
Blog posts by “Field” claim that 90 percent of Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted were it not for their “Black’ness” [sic] and reference “Black Supremacy” in the NBA. Another questions why Williams College condemned white supremacist group Identity Evropa without condemning the Black Lives Matter and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements.
Keselj, a Crimson editorial editor, said she publicized the content of the blog posts on TikTok because she felt it was “important for people to know.”
“I think a lot of people view academia as something where bigotry like this doesn't exist, especially in a place like Harvard that’s so widely renowned,” she explained. “A lot of people were really shocked about it. A lot of them were like, ‘How can we help? Is there any petition we can sign?’”
In addition to public criticism, some Gov 50 students and others are preparing a petition to demand Kane’s removal from his teaching roles in the Government department.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced that the Government department is currently reviewing the allegations against Kane after students wrote to her expressing concerns about the matter.
“We are looking into it now, and someone from my office will follow-up after we understand all of the details,” Gay wrote in a Friday email to students.
Kane did not respond to a request for comment on the student criticisms Sunday. He also did not respond to a previous request for comment asking whether he authored the posts and for his response to the allegations.
In a Friday email, Kane invited students who were uncomfortable remaining in his class to transfer to Government 51: “Data Analysis and Politics,” which is taught by a different instructor.
A number of his students have already expressed their intention to switch and department chair Jeffry Frieden wrote in a Sunday email to students in the class that they would not incur fees if they dropped the course or added another.
Keselj, who said she intends to transfer out of Gov 50, said she did not want to remain in the course and did not feel she could show Kane “even an ounce of respect.”
“I don't know how I could even look him in the eye over the web camera,” she said.
Other Gov 50 students, including Priscilla Agyen ’23, said they felt appalled after hearing about the allegations against Kane.
“I really looked up to him so I was really taken aback. I didn't want to believe it at first,” Agyen said.
Alexander K. Park ’23 also said he found the allegations “disturbing.”
“This was a person that, as a preceptor in this course, I had trusted with having at least a base respect for students and for everybody who was in his class,” Park added.
Park also said he felt Kane’s emailed response was “inadequate” noting that he did not respond to the allegations.
“It was definitely even more shocking to me that he would not have taken the kind of steps to apologize to his students for anybody he might have hurt,” Park said.

UPDATED: September 28, 2020, 7:41 p.m.
An internal email sent to the Undergraduate Council Finance Committee Thursday alerted members of an anticipated budget cut in comparison to previous years.
The Council draws its funds from the College's Student Activities Fee, a $200 payment of which undergraduates can opt out by mailing a letter to the Student Accounts Office. According to the email, only about half of students who paid the fee last year paid it this year.
The SAF also funds House Committees and the College Events Board, which runs College-wide programming like the annual Yardfest concert. The rate students paid rose sharply in 2018, when the College increased the fee from $75 to $200.
UC Finance Chair and Eliot Representative Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 said that the Council received “preliminary guidance” last week that its budget was expected to halve. Still, that estimate may not reflect the College’s eventual allocation to the Council.
“We get our actual allocation on October 5 when admin sort of tells us basically how much they decided to give to us,” Ganesh said, noting students may take leaves of absences until late September, which would impact the amount of money in the fund.
Some students speculated that the increase in SAF waivers may be due to the virtual nature of clubs and activities.
“Interest level [in waiving] is a lot higher this year. I think it’s justified by the fact that it’s a remote campus right now,” Jenny Liu ’21, who waived her fee, said. “It’s because of COVID and the fact that there’s not a lot of student activities, which is what the fee is supposed to be for.”
Liu also said she thinks students were more inclined to waive the fee because — much like tuition — it stayed the same even as the College transitioned online.
“The fact that they charge the same amount for it — I can see how students feel a little like they need to waive it, or they’re going to make an effort to waive it,” Liu said.
One undergraduate — Daniel A. Bodea ’21 — led a coordinated campaign encouraging students to waive the fee. Bodea sent out a mass email to several campus lists in mid-September offering to help them waive the SAF by providing stamps and a letter template. He estimated that his efforts may have cut the SAF fund by six thousand dollars.
“My fundamental disagreement is just how the UC allocates money,” Bodea said.
Bodea said he took issue with what he sees as funding disparities between small clubs at the College that struggle to get funding from the Council and well-funded larger clubs.
“Some clubs [are] getting a disproportionate amount of funding to the point where they’re telling their club members to submit random receipts because they have money left over, whereas smaller clubs don’t get any funding at all,” Bodea said. He added that he thinks the College's 2018 rate hike was unnecessary.
Bodea said he hoped the increase in SAF waivers will lead to finance reform within the Council.
“Ideally, it would just be rates going back to what they were before, because I think there’s really no justification why they doubled or tripled it, and just more transparency overall with how they’re allocating the money,” he said.
Ganesh wrote in an email Monday that the Council allocates funding not based on clubs' size, but rather the number and scope of events applicants expect to hold.
"Clubs that do more, get more," she wrote.
She added that the Council makes an effort to be transparent about how it funds clubs and does not control the SAF rate. The UC includes information about club allocations in its weekly update to undergraduates.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane said the committee which allocates the SAF money to the Council and other recipients “is hopeful that the four organizations who use it — the College Events Board, the House Committees, the Student Advisory Committee of the Foundation, and the UC — will be able to provide robust virtual programming and support for students.”
Ganesh said she fears the Council will not be able to run programs that benefit students without sufficient funding.
“When everybody doesn't pay this fee a lot of things can’t happen. We can't run programs like storage that benefit students on full financial aid, especially first gen and low income students. We can’t run the tech insecurity program, which is giving $160 to students who don’t have laptops or need to pay for WiFi,” Ganesh said. “But also really importantly, there isn't enough money for clubs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 30, 2020, 3:36 p.m.
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council unanimously passed legislation in a Sunday meeting supporting the removal of Government preceptor David D. Kane from his teaching appointment and position as head advisor for the Data Science track within the Government department.
Dunster House representative and Council treasurer Noah A. Harris ’22 and Pforzheimer House representative Chloe E. V. Koulefianou ’23 sponsored the legislation; Currier House representative Fernando Urbina ’22 and the Council’s Black Caucus also co-sponsored the legislation. It called on the Council to endorse and sign a petition by students in Kane’s course, Government 50: “Data.” The petition urged the Government department to restructure the course to limit contact with Kane, offer support for students who decide to drop the course, terminate Kane’s teaching position, and reevaluate his position as Data Science track advisor.
“Whereas the Undergraduate Council’s Black Caucus stands in solidarity with students of David Kane and support[s] them in their endeavors to switch out of or restructure the class, be it therefore resolved that the Undergraduate Council sign this petition outlining the grievances and demands of current Gov 50 students,” the act read.
Students have accused Kane of authoring racist posts over the years on his website, EphBlog, under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25.” “Field” made one post on the blog signed “Dave Kane ’88.” Kane graduated from Williams College in 1988 and founded EphBlog in 2003, according to the website.
One post written by “Field” suggested that Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted if they were not Black; another urged Williams to cease involvement with QuestBridge — a program that allows qualifying students to apply to partner universities free of charge — to reduce the number of low-income students at the school.
When students confronted Kane with allegations of racism in a Slack channel for Gov 50, Kane denied the charges.
Kane did not respond to a request for comment from The Crimson on the recent legislation and petition. He also did not respond to a previous request for comment asking whether he authored the posts and for his response to the allegations.
Gov 50 student Alexis Queen ’23, a member of the Council’s Black Caucus, outlined the petition during the meeting.
“The purpose of the petition is that we want to demonstrate student support outside of Gov 50 for the removal of Kane and list demands to administration, with protections for those who wish to drop the course,” Queen said.
Queen also described the legislation as urgent, stating that petition organizers would soon meet with Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh to discuss their demands.
The Council also discussed some potential issues around the legislation, such as doxxing and allegations of defamation.
“Because of the content of the blog and the nature of the issue, there's a big concern around doxxing of students who are working on this,” Queen said. “So we are looking for a way that doesn’t match one individual’s name for sending out this petition.”
Harris informed the Council of an anonymous tip about concerns over a defamation lawsuit related to the allegations.
“Considering none of these claims are false, the Black Caucus does not feel that we are in jeopardy there,” Harris said. “Everything here is well researched and documented.”
Koulefianou addressed the Council saying she believed it was important for the body to endorse the petition.
“We wanted to have a unified front and have the whole Council sign on,” she said.
The Government department is reviewing the allegations made against Kane. FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in a response to students who reached out with concerns that they will review both student complaints and the posts on EphBlog.
EphBlog has been inaccessible and set to “maintenance mode” since Friday night.

More than half of Harvard’s athletics teams have pledged to attain perfect voter turnout in the November elections.
Twenty-four teams partnered with Harvard Votes Challenge, a student-led group run through the Institute of Politics that aims to secure 100 percent voter turnout across the University. In the previous election cycle in 2018, just 48.6 percent of Harvard students voted, according to HVC. In addition to sports teams, Harvard Votes Challenge is collaborating with student organizations and academic departments. Roughly 100 groups have pledged that their members will vote.
Harvard Votes Challenge organizer Madeleine P. Chai ’21, who is also a captain of the women’s squash team, said that by pledging to vote Harvard athletes can empower one another to advocate for issues that transcend sports.
“This summer, and into the fall, we’ve seen that sports is very clearly related to social issues and political issues,” she said. “I think that athletes should definitely be more comfortable with stepping into that space. Athletes do more than play sports; they can speak to a lot of social issues. They’re also students at Harvard as well and they have an important voice.”
One representative from each team that signed the pledge serves as a student leader to ensure their teammates are registered to vote and have a plan to cast their ballot on or before November 3, when the U.S. will hold federal elections.
Gabrielle A. “Gabby” Donaldson ’23, who is the student leader for the women’s basketball team, said her role stretches beyond nudging her teammates to vote. She will also help them sort through the complexities of registering and voting, which have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.
“It’s not as much, ‘Hey, make sure you register to vote and then go to a polling location.’ But, do you even feel comfortable enough to vote in person? Or should you do an absentee ballot request? How does that process work in your state?”
Donaldson added that she is excited to vote for the first time this year.
Women’s hockey player Sydney R. Sorkin ’21 said the close personal relationships athletes share with their teammates is a powerful tool to increase voter turnout.
“Political science research shows that [having a] more personal connection with someone who’s encouraging you to vote is ten times more successful than a blind phone call,” Sorkin said. “Athletes have a really unique position to leverage your whole team, leverage the teams around you.”
For Sorkin, who is concentrating in government with a secondary in psychology, galvanizing her teammates to vote has enabled her to combine two of her greatest passions: political psychology and women’s sports.
Student Athlete Advisory Committee President Matt R. Thomas ’21 said he is happy Harvard athletes have shown enthusiasm about voting this election cycle. SAAC has been working with Harvard Votes Challenge to encourage athlete participation.
“Student athletes, unfortunately, in the past have not been the most politically active and engaged faction on campus,” he said. “Teams have been really receptive to it and some teams have really taken and run with it.”
While athletes are usually busy running from class to practice and back to class on Election Day, they will have extra time to vote this year since the League canceled all fall athletic activities due to the coronavirus pandemic. Even before that decision, though, Thomas said SAAC had successfully lobbied the Ivy League to cancel all practices and competitions on November 3.
While waiting out the coronavirus pandemic from her home in North Carolina, Donaldson said she is communicating with her teammates virtually to ensure they vote this fall.
“It’s really important for us to realize the efficacy of our vote and realize that hey, we’re athletes, but we’re more than athletes, we’re citizens too,” Donaldson added. “And this is a very important civic duty for us to fulfill.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge issued a temporary emergency order last week requiring additional safety standards for local restaurants beginning September 28.
The temporary order — signed by Commissioner of Public Health Assaad J. Sayah and City Manager Louis A. DePasquale — states that a maximum of six people can comprise a dining party.
The second provision requires that seated food service at a bar cannot commence until October 3. Businesses may offer bar service only after the Cambridge Inspectional Services Department has signed off that the required physical barrier — at least 30 inches high— separates customers from the bar space. Additionally, all parties at the bar must be seated at least six feet apart from each other.
These additional provisions are more restrictive than those established statewide, which allow a maximum of 10 people per party and permit bar seating starting September 28.
Cambridge’s Emergency Order also specifies that any stricter provisions issued by Governor Baker or any departments of the Commonwealth will govern restaurant operations.
The Commonwealth’s workplace safety standards for restaurants — last updated September 22 — outline mandatory standards with which restaurants must comply during the pandemic.
Standards include guidelines for social distancing, hygiene protocols, staffing and operations procedures, and cleaning and disinfecting guidelines. For example, the standards require that restaurants space tables six feet apart; provide alcohol-based hand sanitizers at entrances, exits, and in the dining area; and keep cleaning logs of the date, time, and scope of cleaning.
These guidelines constitute part of Phase III of the Commonwealth’s reopening plan. The Commonwealth provides standards for other establishments as well, including retail businesses, fitness facilities, and hair salons.
As the Commonwealth has progressed through its reopening plan, Harvard Square restaurants have adapted to the evolving guidelines.
David DuBois, owner of Tasty Burger, wrote in an emailed statement that, since its reopening, the restaurant’s Harvard Square location has adopted all state and local guidelines to protect its customers and staff.
“We have supplemented our existing practices with all state and local guidelines and safety procedures to ensure the wellbeing of our guests and team members,” he wrote. “Additionally, we have implemented daily electrostatic spraying to further disinfect the restaurant and launched an online ordering system.”
The Cambridge Emergency Order states it will remain in effect “until further notice or until the declaration of a State of Emergency in the City has been rescinded.”

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard’s expenditures related to the pandemic have been “significant” — including “tens of millions of dollars” in COVID-19 testing alone — in an interview with The Crimson Friday.
“The expenditures are ongoing but they're significant,” he said.
Still, some of the financial devastation that experts predicted at the start of the pandemic has not come to fruition.
“We've done better in some areas than we anticipated doing, in part because the financial markets have recovered reasonably quickly,” Bacow said. “And that's good news. But we also continue to face headwinds in other areas.”
On top of purchasing and administering tens of thousands tests, Bacow said the University has been forced to spend on the curriculum redesigns and information technology required to sustain remote teaching.
The pandemic has also slowed the rate at which labs — which resumed some in-person activities in June — spend their federal research grants, he noted.
“That has consequences, because for every dollar of direct expenditure on a government research grant, we get indirect cost recovery back which supports the fixed cost of operating the University, and that money is not coming in as quickly,” Bacow said.
Interruptions to construction projects — like the near-complete Science and Engineering Complex in Allston and the renewal of Adams House — are also “always expensive,” Bacow said.
“We've made judgments and decisions about deferral of specific capital projects that we could defer,” he said. “There are others that as a practical matter, we could not, because the buildings were half constructed, or the renovations were half done.”
“Those are decisions which we continue to look at and try and evaluate and make judgments in the face of enormous uncertainty,” he added.
Bacow said the University has also been forced to grapple with “substantial foregone revenue.”
“Because we're not collecting room and board, for example, from many students. We have fewer students enrolled, so that's less tuition revenue,” Bacow said. “We've seen a dramatic decline in our executive education activities, so that's less revenue there.”
“The financial impacts of the pandemic have affected philanthropy, they have affected virtually everything that we've done,” he added.
To mitigate the financial fallout, the University-wide salary and hiring freezes announced on April 14 remain in place, per Bacow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students and faculty settle into virtual classrooms this fall, language instructors across several departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have been developing new methods of engaging students virtually.
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations senior preceptor in Arabic, Nevenka Korica-Sullivan, said while the initial transition to online classes during the spring presented sudden challenges, the start of a new semester allowed for more careful adaptation of courses for remote learning.
“I think the core issue in any language class is how we can have a meaningful conversation and meaningful communication in class, because this is how we learn language,” Korica-Sullivan said. “Now, how I deliver material can be a little bit different, because I think online teaching has to be much more intentional.”
“There is less room for being spontaneous, and that's one thing that we are all missing,” she added.
But Korica-Sullivan also said she believes languages classes are more personal than other classes, which has allowed for her to retain a closer connection with her students even in a virtual classroom.
“Trust is something that we build from day one in class, and believe it or not, after a month, a lot of it is already built, conversations become personal,” Korica-Sullivan said.
María L. Parra-Velasco, a Romance Languages and Literatures senior preceptor in Spanish, said language students meet with faculty four to five days a week, which helps students maintain constant communication with each other and the teaching staff.
Parra-Velasco said she misses seeing her students in person and picking up on the emotional cues which help her navigate classroom dialogue.
“Emotion, surprise, doubt, questions — all that information is lost in Zoom when you can’t see them all together at the same time,” Parra-Velasco said.
Korica-Sullivan noted the challenge of picking up body language from students has increased the difficulty in distinguishing students’ pronunciation of Arabic words.
“There are sounds that are in the abstract very difficult to discern and discriminate, but in context it works,” Korica-Sullivan said. “Like I think it's this mismatch, sometimes between, you know, the body language that you can get on the screen, and what the student is saying that sometimes is very, very confusing.”
For the beginner American Sign Language classes, Linguistics preceptor in ASL Andrew R. Bottoms said adapting a “3D language for a 2D world” when signing online presented a particular challenge.
“If I'm showing examples to my students, often there's difficulty with them understanding and then copying,” Bottoms said, through an interpreter. “So I have to often turn myself to the side, and I will then sometimes move all the way around, so that students can see the 3D perspective that they're not getting on a camera.”
However, Bottoms also said "being online actually does bring some benefits.”
“When I'm in person, I have to ensure that all of my students are not using any subvocalization or whispering to ensure equal access to all people in class,” Bottoms said. “Within Zoom, students are all muted, because this is not a spoken language class, so everyone can truly immerse themselves into American Sign Language.”
Bottoms said he is using the fall semester as an opportunity to share with students how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the deaf community. He said he appreciates how his students have continued to engage with deaf culture outside the classroom through other online programming such as the Deaf Awareness Club — a student-run program hosted by the Phillips Brooks House Association.
Parra-Velasco also underscored the importance of public engagement within her course “Spanish 59: Spanish and the Community,” despite its virtual setting. For the course, each student is volunteering with an organization based in their home community or in the Boston-area, providing services such as language translation or mentoring in Spanish.
“I think that we have worked very hard to make sure that our courses are engaging, but the students are also working very hard to take advantage of what is offered and making a big effort to engage with the materials and with their classmates,” Parra-Velasco said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Enrollment at Harvard Extension School is up 8 percent in the 2020-2021 school year, according to Division of Continuing Education spokesperson Harry J. Pierre.
The Extension School, which typically offers classes for both in-person and distance learners, provides Harvard’s academic offerings for nontraditional learners. This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Extension School has waived its on-campus requirements and shifted exclusively to virtual content delivery.
Earlier this year, the Extension School began new academic gap year and undergraduate certificate programs, in addition to its degree-granting and graduate certificate programs. Extension School degree candidates may earn Bachelor’s and Masters of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies.
In an email to The Crimson, Pierre wrote that many programs, including those which traditionally tend not to reach capacity, have seen increased demand.
“Enrollments at HES look strong and have increased nearly 8% over the last year,” Pierre wrote. “We’ve seen increased enrollments in courses and from new student registrations as well. Many of our courses that traditionally have seen low enrollment have seen increased enrollment or are at capacity.”
First-year Extension School student Kody Christiansen said it was always his dream to attend Harvard, and that the Extension School’s coursework flexibility ultimately drew him in.
“With the bachelor's program, you can sort of build your own concentration,” Christiansen said. “They have things laid out for you, like humanities is your overall, but then there's classes from everything.”
Christiansen also cited the vigor of Harvard coursework as a major draw.
“I love a challenge, and I'm so grateful that these programs are not less than; they're not made so that people can just watch TV on another screen while you're watching your lesson,” Christiansen said. “You have to be involved, just like every other school at this university.”
Extension School students have the opportunity to involve themselves in University student organizations in addition to Extension School-only offerings. Christiansen said he’s found a home with the Phillip Brooks House Association on campus.
“I feel so lucky to have been asked to be a student leader for Harvard's Global Day of Service. Because I was homeless for many years and so many amazing organizations helped me get through that, I found this new love for helping other people because of that,” Christiansen said. “And so when I saw the Phillips Brooks House Association call for student leaders for this event, I was right on, I think I was the first person to apply.”
Even as other schools across the University face budget constraints due to the pandemic — notably, the Graduate School of Education announced that they would pause doctoral admissions — Pierre wrote that the Extension School was confident about its financial future, as well as the quality of its academic offerings.
“The financial outlook for Harvard Extension School, and the rest of DCE, remain strong,” Pierre wrote. “With most of our programming for the academic year being online it has given us the ability to offer more courses and programming to students and has increased the capacity for community building.”
Correction: September 28, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the names of the degrees HES confers. In fact, they are Bachelor's and Masters of Liberal Arts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David D. Kane — Government preceptor and Government 50: “Data” instructor — and the class’s course staff jointly announced to students in a Sunday email that Kane will temporarily stop teaching lectures effective Tuesday.
“Starting this Tuesday (9/29) and for the foreseeable future, Gov 50 Lectures will now take place in individual TF-led sessions between each TF, a partner CA, and their recitation students,” the email read. “These lectures will be held in your TF’s usual Zoom room for recitations.”
“The lecture times will not change (7:30am / 12pm Tu-Th), and will follow the same structure of working on problems in breakout rooms,” it added. “All other components of the course, including recitations, will continue as normal. The only change would be in the format of the lectures.”
The staff proposed the changes to students in a Sunday afternoon email containing a survey, and they officially adopted the new course structure Sunday night after calculating that 89 percent of respondents who plan to remain in the course support the proposal. As of Sunday night, 85 students said they support the proposal, 11 students said they did not, and 10 said they plan to unenroll from Gov 50 no matter what the proposal is, according to the course staff’s message.
The announcement comes one day after several Gov 50 teaching fellows emailed their students Saturday proposing a boycott of course lectures taught by Kane. They wrote that 24 hours had passed, and Kane had not addressed the allegations that he authored racist posts on his website EphBlog over the course of several years under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25.”
Kane denied endorsing white supremacy and anti-Blackness but did not reference the posts in a Friday response on a Gov 50 Slack channel obtained by The Crimson.
“I can assure you I do not endorse ‘white supremacy and anti-Blackness.’ Slack is probably not the best place for this conversation. I will send out some options to the whole class later today,” his message reads.
Kane did not respond to requests for comment from The Crimson on the allegations.
In their Saturday message to students, Gov 50 teaching fellows proposed to meet with students privately instead of in lectures to encourage the administration to identify a replacement for Kane.
“The teaching staff and I want to do what’s best for you, our students,” the teaching fellows wrote to their students Saturday. “None of us want to continue with DK. At the same time, we want to make sure you don’t feel that we are abandoning you.”
“We propose the following: We, the teaching staff, will continue meeting with you in private recitations,” the email continues. “We, the teaching staff, and you, the students, will collectively not be present for any lectures taught by DK. We hope this will put pressure on the administration who will be forced to find a replacement for him.”
Government department chair Jeffry A. Frieden called these messages “completely inappropriate” and “unprofessional” in a Sunday email to all Gov 50 students, hours after the staff proposed that Kane will no longer lecture for the time being.
“This message was completely inappropriate,” Frieden wrote. “The teaching staff does not have the right to instruct students to engage in any behavior other than that needed to fulfill course requirements. You are not required to boycott class; you are not required to put pressure on the administration. It was unprofessional for the teaching staff to presume the right to direct your decisions.”
Frieden wrote the Government Department is committed to ensuring academic continuity for students and supporting them whether they decide to stay in Gov 50 or transfer to Gov 51: “Data Analysis and Politics.”
The Registrar has waived the Add/Drop fees for Gov 50 and Gov 51, he added. The College ordinarily charges a $10 fee for students to add or drop a course between the third and fifth Mondays of the semester, according to the student handbook.
Frieden’s message did not directly mention Kane or the posts on EphBlog, referring instead to the “issues that have arisen.”
Some entries posted by “Field” on EphBlog make references to “Black Supremacy” in the NBA, claim that over 90 percent of Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted if it were not for their “Black’ness” [sic], and question Williams College’s condemnation of white supremacist group Identity Evropa without similar condemnation of the Black Lives Matter and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements.
“Field” authored a post on the blog in 2014 that was signed “David Kane ’88.” “David Dudley Field ’25” has been writing posts on EphBlog since 2003. Kane, a 1988 graduate of Williams College, founded EphBlog in 2003 for Williams affiliates, according to the website.
After a few weeks, the staff will evaluate the course and consider adding an option for students to attend lectures given by Kane, which would occur at the same time as the teaching fellows’ lectures, the staff’s Sunday announcement read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has begun several new initiatives this semester which aim to fulfill its Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging priorities for the 2020-2021 academic year.
Outlined in a July letter to SEAS affiliates from SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III, the initiatives include developing a post-baccalaureate bridge program for students who have lacked resources to prepare for a graduate program; increasing the recruitment of underrepresented minority graduate students; and establishing a fellows program to compensate SEAS graduate students and postdoctoral fellows for their work in advancing equity.
Alexis J. Stokes, the director of diversity, inclusion, and belonging at SEAS, said these 2020-2021 priorities stem from a reworking of the original 2019-2024 SEAS DIB Strategic Plan in the wake of this summer’s national movement racial justice movement. The post-baccalaureate bridge program, which was originally intended for implementation in Year 3 or 4 of the Strategic Plan, is now slated to come into force earlier, in Year 2.
“Within the nature of the curriculum and what we are teaching, there are ways that STEM has been used to advance racism,” Stokes said. “Even to this day, we see within the health field, the inequities that exist there; the lack of representation in trials for different vaccines.”
“So, what is our responsibility? Making sure that we are graduating students that are aware of all of these issues,” Stokes added.
SEAS reprioritized the plan based in part on feedback from the “ShutDownSTEM” action on June 11, which put a pause on STEM-oriented activities for the day and instead focused on discussions of racial justice, according to Manager for Advising Programs and Diversity Outreach Christina Zaldana.
The SEAS Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging — which Doyle established in 2017— is composed of a variety of Harvard affiliates, including undergraduates and faculty, working towards diversity and inclusion policy change at the school. The committee meets about every month.
Joey Feffer, an undergraduate member of the committee, said most of its work is long-term.
“No one on the DIB Committee really thinks DIB is something that you accomplish in one year or one semester,” Feffer said.
Feffer added that the group identifies many areas in need of improvement using data, then breaks them up into manageable pieces for the SEAS committee and the school at large to work on over the course of the year.
“There was a climate survey done at SEAS 2 years ago that sort of highlighted a lot of major flaws,” Feffer said. “Priorities were sort of taken from that climate survey and most of those priorities are longer term. Each year, each semester we cut that into actionable chunks.”
Zaldana, who is also a member of the Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, said feedback and data are essential to driving forward new initiatives at SEAS and ensuring they can be tracked and improved upon.
“I think every initiative that we talk about now, we know it’s important that it has to be measurable,” Zaldana said. “How can we track that this is working in some way?”
SEAS Faculty Coordinator Gladys Prins, another member of the committee, said the last few months have ultimately been critical in evaluating and working to improve the culture and climate not only at SEAS, but across the University.
“We’re just here to better this community,” Prins said. “We just want to make Harvard the one Harvard that we all strive for.”

Mostly A’s: No Camera, No Mic, No Chat
Even though class is now attendable by the click of a button, it was probably still a struggle to find the motivation to go. Your naps in between classes were initially energizing, but have now become dangerously good. 15 minutes no longer seems like enough. Now, you just wake up to hop onto the Zoom call and go back to sleep. Or, you’re hungry and ready to eat. Zoom will certainly not stop you from getting your full lunch experience. The no camera, no mic option on Zoom is currently your biggest life hack.
Mostly B’s: Camera, No Mic
Ah yes, the classic camera on, mic off. Whether you’re willfully turning your camera on, you give off the image that you are engaged. But, in reality, you’re completely checked-out. Whether you’re working on an assignment for another class, watching TikToks, or simply just zoning out, it’s safe to say that you have no clue what is going on in this Zoom call. As long as no one knows that, you’re good. Faking it till you make it has never failed you and you’re not about to stop now.
Mostly C’s: Camera On, Mic On, CHAT
The Zoomster. You actually look forward to Zoom calls. Whether or not classes and meetings are in-person or online, it doesn’t matter because you know you will be fully engaged. You’re the person who starts the discussion when the professor divides the 200+ person lecture into breakout rooms. No awkward silences for you today!
Mostly D’s: No Camera, Mic On
If we’re being honest, you probably have no idea that your mic is on. I mean, who turns their camera off, but has their mic on...? The exception is if you’re in a breakout room and actually have something to say. Otherwise, we know that you’re completely unaware of your mic being on.
