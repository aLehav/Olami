After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Watching security personnel subdue unruly fans has long been an exciting bonus for sports aficionados, but last week things really got electric. Police used Tasers on fans twice, once to stop a field runner at a Phillies game and again to subdue a drunken fan at a golf tournament who was angry with Tiger Woods. Although the baseball event in particular may have yielded some very popular YouTube videos, the police officers involved should not have used such excessive force. In both cases, the response was far harsher than the activity warranted, and Tasers are not an appropriate way to deter fans from illegal behavior.
A Taser—more generally called a stun gun, since Taser is a registered trademark—is a type of non-lethal weapon introduced to subdue fleeing or dangerous suspects. It fires two tiny electrodes, connected to the unit by wires, into the skin of the target and generates an electric current designed to prevent the brain from controlling the muscles. In the past decade, police officers in major cities have been using Tasers more frequently. Although the introduction of Tasers may help reduce the number of wrongful deaths, the fact that the weapon will not kill suspects does not mean it is permissible to use at all times, and police officers still need to rely on their judgment.
Running onto the field of a major sporting event is a crime, and armed fans in the vicinity of players certainly pose a safety threat. However, in both recent cases, no players were in danger. The Phillies fan did not appear to be armed and simply ran circles in the outfield. In the golf incident, the man resisting arrest was clearly intoxicated while heckling players. Police should expect drunken people to act belligerently and yell at sports games and should not respond with excessive force, even at more restrained events like golf tournaments. In both cases, the fans could have been stopped without resorting to using a weapon.
Some have argued that the use of the Taser was justified in the Phillies case because it will deter other fans from engaging in similar behavior. However, just one day after the baseball incident, another Phillies fan ran onto the field, suggesting that the Tasing may have had the opposite effect. In fact, the popularity of the footage from the Phillies incident on YouTube—where the user comments largely poke fun at the incident—is somewhat troubling, since it suggests that the public does not take Tasers as seriously as it should.
Tasers can be a useful tool for police, and we hope that they remain available to law-enforcement officials. But in most cases, police should stick to the old-fashioned tackle when subduing fans who jump onto the field. The YouTube crowd will probably find it just as entertaining.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) unabashedly joined the jingoist wing of his party. Supplementing his earlier support for Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070, “The Maverick” launched a television advertisement shamelessly catering to militarists. In the video, McCain, accompanied by a local sheriff, argues that if we swell the ranks of the U.S. Border Patrol  with 3,000 new agents, deploy the National Guard, and complete  the 700 miles of “danged fence” between the U.S. and Mexico, trafficking, trespassing, and murder in Arizona will inevitably disappear. The man-who-would-have-been-president assures us: “It’ll work this time.”
Contrary to Senator McCain’s suddenly aggressive arguments, enforcement-only legislation will do little to decrease crime and violence, especially in the wake of recent events. Cries for state militarization and mass deportation are not only ineffective and inhumane but also dangerous in the current social climate. Folks who support SB 1070 and “completing the danged fence” in the spirit of law and order misunderstand the situation; without addressing the other dimensions of unauthorized immigration, bringing down the hammer right now will threaten public safety.
Much of the pressure behind SB 1070 is rooted in myths about crime and undocumented immigration. Contrary to conventional wisdom, crime rates have been decreasing in Arizona for years—and it’s not because of draconian policing laws.  Undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the average citizen for fear of being deported. This is why the Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police has opposed SB 1070: It compromises their ability to do their job. The law makes no distinction between drug traffickers and a 25-year-old mother or father searching for a day’s work, and as such, it is a threat to effective community policing. Furthermore, many officers have argued that undocumented immigrants will fear to report crimes and emergencies as a result of SB 1070. Perhaps worst of all, officers will be compromised by lawsuits from vigilante citizens who don’t believe they are working hard enough to arrest the undocumented.
As for the argument that a rapid build-up of federal forces will prevent unauthorized immigration and violence on the border, that claim is debunked by the factual history of enforcement. We’ve been beefing up the border for years: Since 1990 the number of Border Patrol agents has grown from 4,000 to over 20,000, more than doubling since 2005.  Since 1986, through the enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, the Border Patrol has implemented a more aggressive strategy, heavily garrisoning urban entry points and pushing migrants into the desert in the hope of halting crossings. It hasn’t worked.  Instead, the undocumented immigrant population has ballooned to 12 million, while the causes of emigration from Mexico persist.
Given Arizona’s current tensions, more enforcement-only legislation can only provoke violence. There’s something sinister going on: an unholy and unreasonable alliance between actual bigots and citizens understandably concerned  about jobs and safety. When politicians like McCain generalize undocumented immigrants as violent threats, they cement the coalition. Tensions are high: McCain is fighting for his political future against a strong right-wing primary challenger, talk-show radio host J.D. Hayworth, a man who speaks of the undocumented immigration debate as a battle to “stand up for our culture” and teach Latino immigrants “the right way to live.” The author of SB 1070, State Senator Russell Pearce, has been openly linked to white supremacist groups. In a maneuver that has little to do with the law or the economy, the Arizona legislature recently banned ethnic studies programs and barred teachers with heavy accents from teaching certain courses. In this climate, it’s easy to cause fear among people who don’t look and sound alike with myopic action. Despite their self-stylization as defenders of law and order, politicians like McCain do nothing but threaten us with chaos.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How did you survive Harvard College?” conservatives ask me, half-jokingly.
Half-seriously, I tell them: “Hell if I know.”
Some pitfalls are shallower than I expected. For one thing, Harvardians are less rambunctious than their peers. Two years ago, for example, Karl Rove, a Republican strategist, spoke at Winthrop House, where he volleyed questions from an unsympathetic but respectful audience. That same year, he spoke at the University of Iowa, where two attendees tried to arrest him. Harvardians are so calm that three years ago several alumni asked President Drew G. Faust to appoint a task force to promote student agitation. They should have told her to cut hot breakfast.
True, Harvardians stage strikes every now and then. But most are spectators, not participants. Rather, I notice the liberal bias in more subtle ways—like when kids at the Institute of Politics play icebreakers. “Name your favorite columnist,” one of them says, and the rest chirp, “Gail Collins!” Meanwhile, I verify her identity with my neighbor: “Oprah’s friend, right?” I also notice it whenever I read The Harvard Crimson, which advocates the Second Amendment’s repeal. Still, I give the paper credit. It no longer supports the Khmer Rouge. And it publishes me.
For another thing, more Harvardians than I expected are conservatives. They rank among the more interesting people on campus, especially the New Englanders. They refuse to wear jeans and use awkward verbs like “midwife” in everyday conversation. They also fascinate liberals, who rarely recognize their prejudice. Last year, for instance, a sociologist interviewed some of us in preparation for a book about young conservatives. Her first question: “Are your parents religious?” Like clockwork.
Yes, liberals try to understand us, but some are patronizing in their attempts. Once when I told a girl I was conservative, her eyes welled with pity. “Do you feel isolated?” she inquired—as if she were my shrink. I thought she was going to show me an inkblot and ask if I saw Dick Cheney. That said, I prefer patronizing to nasty. Liberals can misrepresent our positions without penalty more often than we can theirs. When I criticized Obamacare, for example, a Harvard Democrat wondered about me on the club’s blog, “[M]aybe he’d prefer eugenics.”
Actually, the liberal tilt is quite navigable. Yet one pitfall for conservatives—for everyone, really—is deeper than I expected. It is cynicism.
When political junkies are freshmen, we breathe fire. We attend every event at the IOP. We sign up—by the hundreds—for the political parties. Eventually, however, we realize something. We realize that the politicians are dull and the activists crazy. My freshman year, for example, Dominique de Villepin, then prime minister of France, visited the IOP. His speech was less than profound. “Competition among our states is in no one’s interest,” he said. “The only possible road is our cooperation.” Deep, Dominique, deep.
The activists are worse. You have the sensationalist adults. When the Harvard Republican Club hosted a filming of the movie, “Hillary! Uncensored: Banned by the Media,” three years ago, an activist introduced the film by calling Hillary Clinton a traitor to feminism. “A person should be judged by the content of their character, not the contents of their underpants,” she said. And you have the eager students. One time, for instance, the HRC hosted a party for visitors from other schools, where one guy distributed his business card, which read, “Future Elected GOP Leader.”
Sure, Harvardians are sensationalist and eager when they arrive on campus. But after these encounters, they mellow. This development is a good thing. Unfortunately, some students mellow out. By senior year, they do not believe in conservatism, not because they believe in liberalism but because they do not believe in anything. The problem is overexposure. Students too quickly throw themselves into politics only to learn, “This stuff is dirty,” and give up.
Instead, students—especially conservatives—should pace themselves. If they are interested in politics, they need not spend their mornings in the Government Department, their afternoons at the IOP, and their weekends in New Hampshire. Such a schedule makes politics too familiar. And excessive familiarity breeds apathy.
In short, a conservative survives Harvard College by having a life beyond politics. A paradox, perhaps, but you can manage. The key is persistence. To maintain an interest in politics while living outside it is to be a rather self-controlled junkie. And to remain a conservative after four years at Harvard is to be a very stubborn thing.

I object to your use of the phrase "the Church's penance still lies ahead” in the Crimson Staff editorial “Papal Penance” that was published on Apr. 8, 2010. Although doubtless you intended it to refer to the small proportion of clergy and laity complicit in acts both sinful and criminal, the Church is comprised of all baptized Catholics worldwide, and by implying that all these people have yet to receive penance for sexual abuse, you (however accidentally) slander the names of more than a billion people. Furthermore, your "specific reforms" which should be "immediately adopted," have been either already adopted or have been used and discovered to be counterproductive to the task of weeding out criminals for positions of power. Take your second reform, for instance, that bishops should have more power. Before then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger's 2001 letter “Crimen Sollicitationis,” that effectively centralized reports of abuse to the Vatican (over the heads of local bishops), people like former Archbishop Bernard Law of Boston were able to keep reports from spreading, hush up victims and relocate offending priests, without either the Vatican or civil authorities knowing. This system was deeply flawed, and to advocate even a partial return to it shows only a deep ignorance of the history of the issue. Furthermore, although I agree that the tone of the letter you quoted from “USA Today” was perhaps overcooked in calling the Pope a martyr, you fail to address its central claim: that the Pope is doing everything in his power to weed out sexual abuse. Both you and I are not in positions make such a judgment, and thus I would call on you not to judge the man. Leave that to higher powers.

To the editors:
In his Apr. 23, 2010, op-ed “Volcanic Ash Allowing,” I’m not sure what Pierpaolo Barbieri has in mind when he calls for “fully determined models delivering certainty.” Perhaps he is referring to the models peddled by certain misguided financiers. But to suggest that the entire profession of economics engages in an extreme kind of wishful thinking, or worse, deception, is grossly unfair and misleading. Cobb-Douglas will not predict economic growth in the way that Newton’s Laws describe motion, but it generates crucial insights into economic phenomena and is a powerful tool in understanding the principles underlying economic relationships.
The author wants to draw the wrong conclusion from the fact that simplified models get things wrong (even dramatically wrong). No one denies that we need to better understand and communicate the limitations of data, that it is crucial to guard against unjustified trust in our preferred models (perhaps the author forgets that before the crisis, there were plenty of critics of the efficient market hypothesis who were using data and simulation to predict pathological behavior in asset markets). But a data-driven, formal approach to making policy decisions is quite frankly the best we can do and therefore essential. “Embracing uncertainty” and abandoning mathematical models, while assuming that human behavior isn’t even “remotely predictable” is wrong-headed.
Models, by design, are simplifications with clearly false assumptions. But the success of models lies in their ability to rationalize and often rightly predict the behavior of more complex real systems. Confused applications of the uncertainty principle notwithstanding, the author’s disdain for the “data-heavy, model-driven graduate student” is unjustified. Perhaps in his next piece, Mr. Barbieri can suggest an alternative to restrictive modeling in understanding and predicting phenomena.
As imperfectly informed as the experts at the Volcanic Ash Advisory Center might be, their judgments on the basis of data and computer simulation are presumably more useful than the alternative: the intuitions of the CEO of Air-or-Bust, or perhaps, Mr. Barbieri, on when it’s safe to fly.

To the editors:
As an alum, former Pforzheimer House resident, and Crimed, I was disappointed by the condescending tone of your Apr. 26, 2010 editorial “Separate but not Equal.” Ten years after my graduation from Harvard, it’s sad to see that patronizing attitudes remain toward the Quad.
You lament the “inconvenience of living in the Quad” based on “the fastidious timing of schedules to match with shuttle times” and the fact that “Quad residents must spend 10 or so minutes traveling every time they want to go from their Houses to the Square or the Yard.” Oh, the humanity! Students at universities with truly far-flung campuses, like Arizona or Michigan, probably wouldn’t mind a 10-minute walk or shuttle ride to class. The same goes for commuter students at campuses like Bunker Hill and UMass-Boston. (Harvard has its own tradition of commuters, as described by the great alum Theodore H. White.) And when you’re commuting in the real world—riding the 1-9 from Washington Heights to Wall Street, say, or idling in five lanes of traffic in Los Angeles—a 10-minute commute would look ideal.
As I recall, Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer are not much farther away from the Yard and the Square than are Dunster and Mather. I also recall that the Quad dorms’ facilities compared quite favorably with those of River Houses like Leverett.
Quadlings, don’t sweat the commute. You’ve got beautiful backdrops of foliage in the fall and lilacs in the spring. And don’t sweat your classmates’ condescension. They’ll realize their errors soon enough.

To the editors:
I would like to thank the staff of The Harvard Crimson for continuing to keep the topics of veganism and animal rights in the headlines ("Feminist Calls for Veganism," Apr. 29, 2010). This school year alone, your newspaper has printed no less than five separate articles documenting the shift in the student population toward a meatless diet. From potluck dinner reviews to a story on the high-profile "Is Eating Animals Ethical?" debate last fall with People for Ethical Treatment of Animals Vice President Bruce Friedrich, the prevalence of these discussions on veganism and animal rights underscores a larger nationwide trend in what is widely understood to be one of the most food-conscious and ecologically focused graduating classes in history.
As the Crimson editorial staff wrote last September, "Factory farming is being recognized as an important health and environmental concern, and many have realized the potentially negative effects of meat consumption on climate change" ("Rethinking Meat," Sep. 16, 2010). Harvard students are equally horrified when they discover that the abuse that farmed animals face in today's industrial meat production—including being castrated without being given any painkillers and having their throats cut while they're still conscious—would warrant cruelty-to-animals charges if the cats or dogs who share our homes were the victims.
Thankfully, as a result of efforts by the campus group Harvard College Vegetarian Society, Harvard is several steps ahead of the curve on this growing social-justice issue. Whether students are enjoying Meatless Mondays in Lowell House or reading a vegetarian/vegan starter kit outside of the Science Center, veganism is mainstream at Harvard, and it shows no sign of slowing down its progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I decided not to attend the Senior Class Champagne Brunch this past month because I remembered the experience of eating in Annenberg vividly. During Senior Dinner Swap, another event designed to memorialize a Harvard experience, I relived standing before endless rows of tables, green tray in hand and no friend in sight. I thought that I would be able to console myself by buying a Class of 2010 coffee mug, but it had been sold out. I realized then that the senior class officers weren't kidding: the other senior items—those purchasable memories—were going to sell out, and soon!
Each senior event, carefully designed to encapsulate a memory, was going to disappear faster than used textbooks at the Coop. Memories were going to sell quickly, because each senior who recognized that his time at Harvard was valuable and that it would end soon, would rush to eat in every dining hall, attend every “last lecture,” and buy every item of senior class merchandise. During the weekend of the Champagne Brunch, I realized that hoarding and buying Harvard memories in the form of extracurriculars, events, and mugs is misguided.
Even if I could defy the laws of physics and participate in every Harvard extracurricular, I wouldn't want to, because it would mean straying from the extracurricular niche I had found and loved after months of wandering. It would mean denying the value of having a number of extracurricular options so dizzying that it forces us to make choices and find our place here. After speaking with Daily Princetonian editors at the Georges Conference last month,  I learned that several of us carve out our college niches by remaining loyal to the activities we loved in high school, but there are others who wade through the options, looking for more. I joined The Crimson’s Arts Board because I wrote for my high school paper, but I strayed because I needed to look for a new extracurricular home. I thought I had found it in the student group Stories for Orphans.
Although I enjoyed editing children’s books and helping run Stories, the emails that I received from Arts-l bothered me constantly. For months I debated fully returning to 14 Plympton Street, until the Georges Conference made me realize that if I had become bored with writing reviews and features when stories were everywhere then maybe I was looking for my niche in too many places. Maybe I wasn’t letting myself reshape my memories by adjusting my activities. The weekend of the conference, I decided to stay with Stories but also return to The Crimson to write editorials instead of arts articles.
In searching for extracurriculars again, I was reframing my experience by acknowledging the value of my work and reshaping it by modifying my activities and interests. I realized that I had actually contributed—to varying degrees—to The Crimson for four years and to Stories for two. I played violin throughout those years. After eight semesters of shopping classes, I found an interest in Israeli culture, politics, and society that I turned into a thesis.
Because the activities and interests I found came with a complete set of memories that I had only to reframe and reshape in order to treasure, I didn’t need to conform to Harvard’s culture of shopping and buying. There was no need to wrap up memories in every senior event because being human at Harvard means finding one’s interests and values while realizing the limits of time. It means giving up some events and activities to make room for others and acknowledging that what one has is valuable.
Even outside of Harvard, it is unnecessary to chase memories that are attached to buildings and booze cruises. According to Psychology Professor Daniel T. Gilbert, Americans don’t need to long for places associated with their memories, because those places are everywhere. With every corporate coffee shop that we see, we can remember that special date or that productive thesis meeting. According to Gilbert, “When the industrial smoothing of our nation’s once-variegated edges has been fully accomplished, Americans…will be marinating in memories that happened everywhere but not somewhere, reliving experiences that are located in time but dislocated in space.”
Although we Americans might lose our value for specific places, we can all come to value freedom by realizing how much time we have to reshape our activities and reframe our memories. Because the reshaping and reframing of memories doesn't end soon, we are free not to hurry our shopping for or even purchasing of them. There is no reason even to conform to the senior class's vision of special activities, because we can create our own memories, which can be more special than just another drink from the party punch.
I smile when I remember how my best friend and I recently ate crepes at La Creperie like we did during a first-year study break, because I found my own way of memorializing my Harvard years. Although I won't be able to withstand the pressure of Senior Week reminder emails completely, at least I’ll know I have valuable alternatives to remembering my time here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mariam Braimah ’13 was in eighth grade when she told her parents she didn’t want to be a doctor.
Braimah’s parents—immigrants from Nigeria—had long wanted their Brooklyn-born daughter to go into medicine. In her parents’ minds, becoming a doctor “is a sure bet at being successful.”
“I can’t really say what’s expected of African-Americans, but Nigerian families expect something in the medical field, at worst a lawyer,” Braimah says of her parents’ expectations.
But, instead of spending her days in lab, Braimah plans to concentrate in History of Art and Architecture or a special concentration in architecture.
While she’s straying from her parents’ ideal career path, Braimah says it’s an easier pill for her parents’ to swallow for one reason—she’s studying at Harvard.
Despite the fact that she is the daughter of Nigerian immigrants and not from Nigeria herself, Braimah still shares a common burden with many students from developing countries: the pressure to study a “practical” field, such as medicine, science, or engineering.
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
A liberal arts education system like Harvard’s does not exist in many countries, such as in Kenya, home of Gerishom Gimaiyo ’13.
Gimaiyo says he originally planned to attend medical school in Kenya.
But as he awaited entrance to the university—all Kenyan students wait at least a year after high school before attending college—he decided to go to Harvard instead.
Director of International Admissions Robin M. Worth ’81 says she often finds it difficult to explain the benefits of a liberal arts education to students in developing countries where university education is designed to prepare students for particular professions.
Gimaiyo echoes this idea, noting that Harvard’s curricular structure differs widely from the studies his peers pursue in Kenya, where students take nearly all the same courses.
“The U.S. system provides the opportunity to ‘find yourself,’” Gimaiyo says.
Since coming to Harvard, Gimaiyo has decided to concentrate in economics, though his decision may not be easily understood back in Kenya.
“[My doctor] asked what I was going to do [at Harvard], when I told him economics, he asked why I was leaving medicine to do some ‘funny thing,’” Gimaiyo says.
He explains that in Kenya, economics is seen as an art rather than a practical field of study. As a result, Gimaiyo says that he plans to get a secondary field in Computer Science to give his studies a more practical focus.
From an early age, students in developing countries are heavily exposed to science, engineering, and medicine, according to Omer Aftab ’11, a native of Lahore, Pakistan.
“That’s what they’re exposed to, so that’s what they go to when they come to Harvard,” Aftab says.
While Worth says that a liberal arts education prepares people to be better professionals, better citizens, and better problem solvers, she acknowledges that many students come from cultures where “good students do science.”
MONEY MATTERS
Not only are “practical” careers such as medicine considered more prestigious in many cultures, they also lead to high-paying jobs.
Worth says that education is one of the few ways for young people to achieve financial success and improve the lives of their family members.
Braimah describes the attitude her parents have toward success as “doing something you enjoy, but making sure it makes money.”
She says she considered her potential future earnings as she weighed her concentration options. Growing up, Braimah says she watched her parents work hard to move up the social ladder, and money began to become synonymous with success and happiness.
“The higher you go, there’s just a better life, and better schools,” she says. “Just can’t be poor because that won’t be fun.”
Gimaiyo agrees, saying that there is a strong correlation between people’s concentration choices and their ability to find a job in their home countries after graduation. In Kenya, he says, it is rare to find someone studying folklore and mythology, women and gender studies, or linguistics, as those concentrations are not considered marketable.
However, Aftab says he believes that a degree from Harvard makes it possible for students to find jobs in their home countries, even if they study something more obscure.
“Any degree at Harvard can get a job,” he says. “I don’t think undergraduate degrees affect job factors much, I don’t think there’s a strong correlation.”
But Gimaiyo says that even people with highly-marketable degrees in engineering sometimes have difficulty finding jobs in Kenya, so he feels pressure to do something people in Kenya would consider practical.
“If you tell someone you’re doing linguistics, even here at Harvard or at Oxford, people won’t consider it practical. You want to choose something that’s considered practical back home because at the very least you want to get a job.” Gimaiyo says.
LOOKING AHEAD
After graduation, students from outside the United States must decide whether to return to their home countries.
Gimaiyo says that he wants to go back to Kenya to pursue a career in public service, perhaps focusing on economic policy making.
But he says he still worries about the possibility that his concentration choice will have a negative impact on his ability to find a job.
“Economics is considered an art, not very practical,” Gimaiyo says. “But learning it at Harvard, it might give me a certain edge. When I want to go into policy making, it might make the process a bit smoother.”
While he plans to return to Pakistan, Aftab says he is unsure what career he will pursue, though he is thinking about starting his own business.
Braimah says she plans to pursue her passion for architecture, despite her parents’ hopes for her to become a doctor. She says she would like to work in New York to allow her to focus on corporate architecture.
Braimah says her parents are beginning to accept her unconventional career ambitions, and her dad has even given her some architecture books.
“I love my parents, I love the way they raised me, even though they pushed that doctor thing. I understand they really just want the best for their children, and to them a doctor is the best you can be. If they hadn’t pushed me, I wouldn’t be here,” she says. “But if I took Women and Gender Studies, my parents would demolish me,” she adds with a laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing 1555 feet above the ground, Whitney R.S. Fitts ’12 was shocked to see that only a glass panel kept her from free-falling into the congested streets of Shanghai.
The parents of her Chinese roommate at Harvard—a local couple that served as her unofficial tour guides last summer—looked down at the bustling traffic below and nonchalantly asked Fitts to take a picture with them on the glass panel.
“I couldn’t do it,” says Fitts, who admits that she was afraid of heights.
Fitts and her companions were on an observatory deck in the Shanghai World Financial Center—a wedge-shaped skyscraper that currently ranks as the world’s third tallest building—taking in a panoramic view of one of the most rapidly developing cities in the world.
“It is kind of as if you took all the biggest skyscrapers in the U.S. and like jam-packed [them] into one square block.” Fitts says. “Every building that is going up is taller than the next, and they are all being built within a year.”
But the imposing skyscrapers were just one of the many aspects of Shanghai that impressed Fitts when she visited China last summer for an internship.
Fitts is one of many in recent years to choose China as a summer destination.
Two Harvard sponsored programs—the Harvard China Student Internship Program (HCSIP) and Harvard Beijing Academy (HBA)—have garnered growing interest, attracting a combined enrollment of approximately 160 students this year.
Some participants in the programs say that while they initially visited China to improve their language skills or to gain practical experience working at an internship, they ultimately left with a diverse perspective on China’s rich history and culture.
THE TREND
According to China studies professor William C. Kirby, undergraduate interest in traveling to China has grown exponentially in recent years.
Student enrollment in Chinese languages has nearly tripled in the last decade, he added.
This year, more than 220 students applied to HBA, according to Ye Tian, a teaching assistant in East Asian Languages and Civilizations.
Similarly competitive, HCSIP has witnessed more than a three-fold increase in the number of applicants, from 45 in 2008 to 145 in 2010. Of the 145 students who applied this year, 60 will be granted the opportunity to intern at various Chinese companies, according to John Chen, who, as executive director of the Harvard China Fund, co-founded HCSIP in 2008.
Partially attributing HCSIP’s popularity to its accessibility to students who have not had previous exposure to Chinese language and culture, Chen says that the program provides students with the chance to forge a life-long engagement with China.
“I hope more American students without any background in China come to apply,” Chen says.
Undergraduates cite interest in China’s booming economy as one of the most important factors in their decision to choose China as their summer destination.
“It’s really unbelievable to see that and realize that it [was] farmland fifteen years ago,” Fitts says, “and I think that’s something you really can’t understand—the speed of development in China—until you’ve been there.”
Echoing this point, Kirby notes that in recent years, more than 10 new subways lines, two new airports, four new bridges, three new tunnels, and a magnetic levitation train were built in Shanghai alone.
In comparison, the next big infrastructure project in Boston is an extension of the green line, Kirby adds.
HOME TO A MIX OF VIBRANT CULTURES
From working at China’s central bank to an orphanage in southern China, Harvard students who choose the country as their summer destination are exposed to a wide spectrum of Chinese cultural practices and lifestyles.
Andrew J. Stein ’12, who participated in the HBA language program last summer, says that while he considers acquiring language skills important, exposure to Chinese culture made the summer experience more memorable.
For example, Stein says he was impressed with how Mongolians killed a goat by driving a hole in its chest before reaching in and grabbing the heart to stop it.
In this way, Stein says, they are able to keep the blood in the body and the lamb fresh.
While Stein experienced the nomadic way of life in inner Mongolia, Tsering J. van der Kuijp ’12 encountered the upper echelons of Chinese society in the metropolitan setting of Beijing.
In mid-August, van der Kuijp was taken to a location called “the academy,” a training facility for COFCO, one of China’s largest agricultural trading companies, where he worked as an intern.
At a banquet that night, the employees of the company would constantly toast the executives, an exchange that taught van der Kuijip a lesson on Chinese table manners.
You can tell who the “big cheese” of the table is, van der Kuijp says, by noting how lower level employees keep the brim of their glasses below that of their superior’s.
William F. Guzick ’11, who interned at a consulting company through HCSIP, echoes the experience of riding a constant learning curve in an unfamiliar country—even in the more mundane encounters.
“You never knew what to expect from a Shaobing,” Guzick says, referring to the traditional Chinese flatbread with a variety of choices for fillings, and “that was my experience in China in general: there is always something around the corner.”
“The biggest thing that I gained was outside [the] academic or professional,” he adds. “It was being able to understand what home means for one billion people in the world.”

Whole grain intake is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower mortality rate in patients with type 2 diabetes, Harvard School of Public Health researchers say.
The study, published in The American Heart Association’s Circulation journal on monday, analyzed data from 7,822 U.S. female nurses with type 2 diabetes and found that the group of individuals with the highest level of grain intake displayed a 16 to 31 percent lower mortality rate than the group at the lowest level.
In addition, the researchers found that women with type 2 diabetes who consumed bran—the fiber-filled part of the whole grain—displayed lower mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease.
Though other studies have examined relationships between whole grain intake and mortality, this paper is the first to look at data compiled on individuals who already have diabetes, according to Lu Qi, an assistant professor in the department of nutrition at HSPH who co-authored the study.
Because his team examined a pool of nurses who have obtained a higher education than the general population, the findings provided more accurate and reliable information, Qi said.
The study is unique because it analyzed data for people who already have diabetes, unlike previous research that draws associations between whole grain consumption and mortality rates in healthy people, according to Eric L. Ding, an HSPH research fellow, who is unaffiliated with the study.
“The study shows that even if you have already developed disease, it’s never too late to prevent more mortality risk in the future,” Ding said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To address concerns about the severity and vagueness of the Administrative Board’s policies, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to expand the College’s sanctions for academic dishonesty violations and to clarify policies regarding student collaboration.
The reforms, ratified by FAS on Tuesday, provide the Ad Board with two new, and arguably less severe, options when issuing rulings in academic dishonesty cases.
The changes also include a new provision that allows students to assume some collaboration is permitted in their coursework unless otherwise stated.
While Faculty members will continue to be required to inform the Ad Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—of incidents of academic dishonesty, they will also have new powers to administer “local sanctions” in conjunction with Board and the department chair. These local sanctions—one of two new responses to academic dishonesty that the Board will have at its disposal—will include mandatory tutoring, a required rework of the assignment in question, or a grade reduction.
The Ad Board will also be given the power to exclude a student from a course, which will have the same consequences as failing a course.
Many administrators and faculty members say teaching staff are sometimes reluctant to turn students over to the board because they see required withdrawal as an overly-severe response. Over the last five years, 36 percent of academic dishonesty cases have resulted in required withdrawal from the College.
“Hopefully, [the reforms] will result in a more systematic application of policy and more teaching moments,” wrote Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, a member of the since-dissolved Committee to Review the Administrative Board, in a conversation via Skype from Argentina.
“Sometimes cases of academic dishonestly are less about dishonesty rather than a lack of understanding,” said Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison. “This is an educational institution, and the idea is that we have these teaching moments and we don’t want to miss out on them.”
The second change affirmed by the Faculty clarifies requirements regarding outright collaboration, discussion, and proofreading.
“If the syllabus or website does not include a policy on collaboration, students may assume that collaboration in the completion of assignments is permitted,” the changes read. “Collaboration in the completion of examinations is always prohibited.”
These changes are meant to promote a more open exchange of ideas and codify acceptable practices.
“We don’t want it to be that the students don’t know what it is expected of them, and that’s what it’s been like in the past years,” said Ellison.
This marks the second round of reforms that have come out of the Committee to Review the Ad Board’s report to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
Members of the committee say they are glad the Faculty has voted to put their recommendations in place.
“I think the members of [the] committee are pleased with this most recent implementation of the Ad Board Review Committee recommendations,” Donald H. Pfister, a professor and a member of the review committee, wrote in an e-mail. “It seems to me that those present at the Faculty meeting were satisfied that the recommendations that were made helped clarify the expectations of faculty and students alike.”
Previously, the Faculty voted to have students testify before a subcommittee of the Ad Board instead of the entire committee and to adjust the role of the Allston Burr resident deans in the process.

An undergraduate has been dismissed from Harvard College after allegedly hacking into online accounts of the teaching staff in his courses.
The Faculty Council decided on May 5 to dismiss the student, who, according to Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, collected confidential information and used it to gain unauthorized access to the Registrar’s Office’s grading portal.
The student, whose name has not been released by administrators, designed a website to obtain the Harvard University IDs and the personal identification numbers (PIN) of his instructors.
“Their privacy was violated, and I think that violates a community standard that’s sacrosanct here,” Ellison said. In addition to obtaining improper access to teaching staff members’ accounts, the former student “was also dishonest in his dealings with the College and the Administrative Board,” Ellison said.
This dismissal—which severs the student’s ties with the University—marks the first since the Faculty amended its disciplinary policies on Oct. 6, 2009.
Previously, a vote of the full Faculty was required to dismiss an undergraduate, but the October reforms put the power of dismissal in the hands of the Faculty Council—the highest governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The reforms were largely motivated by concerns over student privacy.
“There is something wrong with distributing to the whole Faculty, who may or may not come to the meeting, confidential and sometimes volatile materials,” English professor Elaine Scarry, a member of the since-dissolved Committee to Review the Administrative Board, said at the October Faculty meeting during which the changes were approved.
In addition, having a smaller group of Faculty members review a student’s case allows for a more thorough examination of that student’s situation, Ellison said.
“They were very engaged in the process. They were able to consider everything,” said Ellison about the Council’s involvement in the recently-dismissed student’s case.
Faculty Council member Harry R. Lewis ’68 agreed that the new system was successful.
“I thought the new procedure worked very well and came to a just conclusion,” he wrote in an e-mail.

The numbers can be overwhelming, Harvard Kennedy School student Marie-Ange O. Bunga says.
Five million people have died due to the ongoing war in her home country of the Democratic Republic of Congo, supported by the systematic rape of over 500,000 women and their children by vigilante groups.
When Bunga realized that not many people had heard of the ongoing conflict in the Congo, she decided to organize the Congo Initiative at Harvard to raise awareness.
Now, five months later, the initiative has expanded to a group of 10 affiliates representing different schools and related organizations across the campus. But Bunga knows that her part of the fight has only just begun.
“Our hope is that the organization keeps going and stays active,” said L. Ellen Knickmeyer, fellow Congo Initiative member and Kennedy School student. “There’s a threshold when enough people get involved, and things start happening.”
“We need to reach that threshold,” she added.
Bunga said that one of her main priorities through the Congo Initiative is to educate Harvard students about the conflict in the country. The atrocities in the Congo, according to Knickmeyer, have gone mainly unreported by the press.
Knickmeyer had worked as a reporter in West Africa until 2005, and in her five years in the area, she was able to make only one trip to the Congo.
“I saw just horrible starvation because of the war. They were hiding in the bushes, and they couldn’t get treatment,” Knickmeyer recalls. “So much of the killing happens out of sight.”
Since the initiative’s first meeting in January, members have organized several informational events, including a panel discussion and a week-long awareness drive during which they obtained 350 signatures on a petition to Congress.
The initiative seeks to apply pressure to individuals with the political capabilities to enact change, Bunga said. The success of this tactic is reflected in the fact that the situation in Darfur has gained attention as an important issue, and many of the appropriate steps have been taken to confront conflicts in Uganda and Liberia, according to Bunga.
“It’s finally Congo’s turn to get the attention it needs,” Knickmeyer said. “We need to put this problem on the front burner instead of the back burner.”
Bunga and Knickmeyer, as well as many members of the Congo Initiative, will be graduating this year, and the leaders hope to find the next generation of concerned citizens.
Bunga said that she believes the Congo Initiative has made considerable progress since its establishment—the group is already in cooperation with the Harvard Humanitarian Intiative, the Human Rights Center at HKS, and other organizations that work on issues related to Africa awareness.
“We want to have committees working on the advocacy side and working together with students with issues on the field,” Bunga said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her pursuit of the highest standards at Harvard Law School during her tenure as dean, Elena Kagan gained a reputation for her effective leadership and assertive management style.
Though her nomination as Supreme Court Justice on Monday has been warmly received by many colleagues, several individuals among the Law School’s faculty and staff interviewed by The Crimson in the last month raised questions about how Kagan’s temperament may translate to her time on the bench.
At the official announcement of her nomination, President Barack Obama hailed Kagan, currently Solicitor General, as a “consensus builder” known for “her openness to a wide range of viewpoints.”
During her five years as dean, Kagan pushed through a major curricular reform and won the hearts of students and faculty alike by reaching out with simple gestures, such as opening an ice skating rink (now closed due to budget cuts) and providing free coffee.
But multiple interviews with Law School staff depict Kagan as a brusque leader whose ambitious agenda of effecting change created a culture of high standards and sometimes fostered tense relations with some of her co-workers.
Three Law School colleagues characterized Kagan’s management style as “very Washington,” an echo of her previous administrative experience in government as Thurgood Marshall’s clerk and former President Bill Clinton’s Associate White House Counsel.
“She brought very high expectations to the school,” said current Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, who enthusiastically endorsed her predecessor’s nomination on Monday. “She held no one more than herself to high standards. So ‘We’re fine, we don’t have to be stepping it up’—that attitude was over when she was dean. Some people didn’t really like it, some people disagreed.”
“Not everybody loves change,” Minow added.
A HEAVY-HANDED LEADER?
Several faculty members credited the success of Kagan’s sweeping initiatives and her ability to break through bureaucratic logjams at the Law School to her strong-handed management style.
“There’s a lot of navel-gazing in academia,” said Dean of Students Ellen M. Cosgrove, who lauded Kagan for transforming the pace and productivity at the Law School. “She was someone who wants to get the job done quickly, on a time-frame that is more consistent with the real world and the corporate world.”
Fresh from a post in the White House, Kagan brought intensity along with her proposals to remake a Law School tired of being second best to perennial rival Yale Law and criticized for a lack of concern for its student body.
“She’s a demanding dean—as she should be,” Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz said.
Kagan succeeded Robert C. Clark as Dean, whose administrative style starkly differed from Kagan’s.
Clark faced an ideologically divided faculty during his time as Dean, and one of his major accomplishments was soothing the rifts that would pave the way for some of Kagan’s most transformative initiatives.
But an ambitious reform campaign at an institution that has been described as “Beirut on the Charles” for its vitriolic academic disputes also led to bruised egos and heated conversations, according to multiple sources at the Law School.
Law School Professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 acknowledged that he had heard “that she would lose her temper,” but he added that Kagan led the school with a “firm hand” like a good manager. Kagan was “willing to fire people that needed to be fired,” Tushnet said.
Few faculty members interviewed for this article voiced displeasure with Kagan’s management style, but some staffers and administrators said that the former dean’s high-energy, ambitious agenda placed a strain on their working relationships.
Former director of the Law School library Harry S. Martin III ’65 observed that some staff members working under Kagan “didn’t seem to get along with her, didn’t warm to her.”
In the “pursuit of excellence,” Kagan set the bar high for her colleagues and created “a culture of incredibly high expectations and high stakes,” according to former Registrar staff member Leslie Sutton-Smith.
“It was not as much a collaborative effort as it was making sure everything was right before it got to Elena,” Sutton-Smith said. “You have to come to the table 150 percent prepared because she will find a hole in whatever your argument is.”
“As a result of that, she could be perceived as someone to be afraid of,” she added.
In pushing for change, Kagan often displayed an insensitivity to the opinions and feelings of others, according to Maura H. Kelley, a faculty assistant who worked at the Law School for over 25 years.
“If you go against her, she doesn’t take very kindly to that,” said Kelley, who was familiar with staff assistants that worked under Kagan. “If she presents an idea, she wants everyone to accept it immediately without question, without debate, without input.”
But Sara D. Zucker, director of International Legal Studies Program, said that the word “fear” does not spring to mind in describing her interactions with Kagan in the past.
A “forceful” personality who made very clear “what she wanted,” Kagan held everyone up to the same, albeit very high, standards—including herself, according to Zucker.
Kagan was also quick to acknowledge a job well done.
Kagan instituted what was known as “pie-day,” an occasion in November for staff to gather, eat pie, and write thank-you cards to one another. She also made a point of remembering staff members’ names—which one staffer said was appreciated at an institution where relationships between faculty and staff are often tinged by elitism.
SETTING A NEW STANDARD
Kagan’s colleagues overwhelmingly voiced their support for her nomination despite her sometimes abrasive manner, which they saw as a byproduct of her strong desire for implementing change at the Law School.
“She was pushing for the school to be better every single day,” Minow said. “Some people didn’t really like being held to a standard and didn’t like being told you could do better.”
University Professor Frank I. Michelman said he believed her experience leading the Law School would translate well to her role on the Court.
“You have to deal with a lot of constituencies in ways that are considerate of and responsive to their interests,” Michelman said.
“Most relevant to the Supreme Court post is her decision-making style,” Minow said. “She would listen to each person carefully, remembering their comments even better than they did; approach each issue with an open mind; and reach a judgment based on fairness.”
“She was a beloved dean, as I hear regularly from faculty, students, and staff,” Minow added.
But one professor, who requested to remain anonymous to maintain relations with the Law School, said that Kagan’s tense relations with staff provide clues to how she may conduct herself as a justice.
“The treatment of subordinates is definitely relevant to her values and our assessment of her as a progressive justice,” the professor said, adding that Kagan’s prowess as a “consensus builder” who would be able to sway Justice Anthony Kennedy, for example, is undermined by her temper, which the professor believes may hinder her ability to work well with others on the bench.
“Justice Kennedy would not like that,” the professor said.

With player nicknames like “The Diesel,” “The Horse,” and “Chocolate Brrrrrhrrrrrrr,” one might think it’s a team that doesn’t take itself too seriously. But when it comes to competing for the national stage, the Harvard Red Line and Quasar ultimate Frisbee teams are strictly business.
With their success at Regionals last weekend, the men’s Red Line and women’s Quasar teams now anxiously await to hear what seeding will come their way for Nationals, where the top 20 teams in the country will face off. For the Red Line—a team whose roots stretch back to the 1970s—it’s nothing new, but for Quasar, this season marks its first trip to the championships, which will take place in Madison, Wisc. over Memorial Day Weekend.
To qualify for Nationals, each team had to take on long-standing area rivals at the New England Regional tournament last weekend. To make the Nationals cut, each team had to place within the top two in the region. The Red Line swept its slate, which featured Tufts and Middlebury—both of whom got the upper hand earlier in the season. With the sweep, the Red Line can expect its highest-ever bid in the postseason. Quasar polished off Stonehill and Tufts—both of whom also beat Quasar in the regular season—clinching its first postseason nod despite a loss to Middlebury.
Though it’s the first time for Quasar, a bid to the tournament has been a long time coming. Last season, Quasar finished third at Regionals, but it only lost three players from that team while adding a whole crop of freshman talent. Quasar knew it had all the pieces in place, but the thought of a postseason still remained an unspoken goal.
“It was the closest thing to saying we want to go to Nationals,” Quasar co-captain Bianca Verma says about the team’s position at the beginning of the season. “We didn’t want to jinx it.”
For the Red Line, according to junior co-captain George Stubbs, it’s been a near miracle to finish the season. Plagued by injuries—sophomores Richard Newcomb and Thomas Heffernan suffered a broken collarbone and broken nose, respectively, and junior Robbie “J” Helbling rebroke his foot—the team limped into the regional tournament.
Another junior, Andrew Vogt, has also seen limited action this season due to injury, but he’s no stranger to playing through pain in high stakes ultimate competition. The Winnipeg native captained the Canadian junior national team both in 2006 and 2008. And when he was able to get in this season, according to Stubbs, “he played a like a rockstar.”
Indeed, the entire Red Line team lived up to its potential in defeating the squad’s regional foes.
Still, while both teams are excited and focused on their upcoming competitions against elite opponents, getting to Nationals has taken more than just skill: fielding a team at all at the club level is a difficult task. Each team is allotted only $2,000 from the Undergraduate Council, which, according to Stubbs, is about the amount of money needed to cover one player.
“It’s hard,” Stubbs says. “It’s a big financial commitment that everyone has to make each year.”
In addition to paying out of pocket, both teams also rely heavily on their alumni bases, which have stayed actively connected—many alums have offered to drive up to Madison from Chicago to drive players around. And with support like this throughout the program, both the Quasar and Red Line hope to make attending Nationals a regular expectation.
“This year, since our program has been growing so much, our alums are really invested in how we’re doing,” Verma said. “Building an alumni base…is really going to be the future of our organization.”

After six years as the head water polo coach for the Harvard men’s and women’s teams, Erik Farrar is stepping down. Farrar announced his resignation this afternoon after coaching the men’s team to four top-three Northern Division finishes and the women to an additional four top-three finishes before the division contracted to just three teams this season.
Despite his success with the Crimson squads, Farrar said that he would be leaving to pursue goals outside of the sport.
In addition to recruiting some of the top student-athletes in the country, Farrar has coached a number of men and women who, under his guidance, have received Collegiate Water Polo Association All-Conference, All-American, All-Academic, and All-Northern Division team honors. To emphasize Farrar’s encouragement of academic achievement, over 80 of his athletes have been named to the CWPA Scholar-Athlete teams.
Farrar’s career in the sport began in the Ivy League as a player at Brown, during the 1980s. He went on to lead both the Bears’ men’s and women’s squads, serving as an assistant and head coach.
His time at Brown is just part of the 35-season coaching career and legacy Farrar leaves behind.
Known for promoting excellence both inside the pool and out, Farrar will be missed by his players, the Athletic Department, and Harvard community.

A crowd of 50 or so gathered in the posh rooftop residence of the Quincy House Masters on Thursday evening to celebrate the release of the book Protest Nation: Words that Inspired a Century of American Radicalism. Guests included undergraduates, alumni, graduate students, and faculty—mostly friends and acquaintances of authors Timothy P. McCarthy, Quincy House tutor and Lecturer on History and Literature, and John C. McMillian, Quincy House tutor.
Protest Nation, released earlier this week, is a collection of speeches, letters, broadsides, essays, and manifestos from all activists who shaped the backbone of America's radical movements and tradition of activism. In the vein of McCarthy and McMillian's previous book, The Radical Reader, the new book focuses on activist movements that challenged the country and changed history.
At the party, McCarthy spoke to guests about the ideas that inspired the book. He said that we should love our country enough to criticize it. "Obama's election represents the symbolic end of the twenty-first century civil rights movement," said McCarthy. He continued, "now it's time for another movement. It's time for us to critique our nation in order to make it better."
Protest Nation is meant to inspire readers to do just that. Rebecca J. Cohen '12, who had McCarthy as an expos preceptor and spent her past two spring breaks on his alternative spring break program, said that the book will inspire anyone interested in advocacy, from civil rights, gay rights, to even environmentalism. "McCarthy is a huge inspirational model. It's great to see his work show on a national level."
Protest Nation, along with McCarthy and McMillian's other books, can be purchased at most national bookstore chains, online, or locally at The Harvard Bookstore.

The CVS on Mass. Ave. got a bit of a makeover this week with three new self-service machines and a new look upstairs.
Most notably, the counters in front of the stairs have been removed and replaced with three automated self-service machines, one of which was still being installed earlier today. The machines, which include scanners and bagging stations, allow shoppers to take care of transactions by themselves. They're fairly intuitive and are similar to those found in other grocery stores.
Meanwhile upstairs, aisles now open in the direction of the pharmacy rather than the stairs. Also, many items have been rearranged. For example, the laundry detergent is now where dietary supplements used to be. Greeting cards are now upstairs as well, and their former home downstairs is still under construction.
Employees—who referred comment to their managers who were not at the store—were at the self-service machines helping patrons who, while surprised by the changes, appeared to be taking them in stride.

It's official! Flat Patties will be reopening on Monday.
We've been checking in with Tom Brush, owner of Flat Patties, ever since the restaurant moved out of The Garage in January. Now, four months later, Brush says he's ready to reopen at 33 Brattle Street by Crema Café.
In addition to having a space of its own, Flat Patties has tweaked its menu a bit, Brush said, but prices have only changed about 25 to 50 cents.
The new Flat Patties will sell hot dogs and frozen custard (vanilla and chocolate) in addition to its freshly-made sandwiches and salads. Perfect for a quick summer snack.
"It's the same old Flat Patties in a nicer setting," Brush said.
Well, we're looking forward to it.

The Boylston Gate shuttle stop, where Quadlings  catch their ride home after a late night partying, was moved Wednesday.
The difference for Harvard students sprinting to  make the shuttle? About 80 feet.
In order to complete the last link of a bike path on Massachusetts Ave.,  the City of Cambridge has moved back the bus stop locations for the MBTA,  Harvard, and M2 buses by five parking spaces, according to David E. Harris, Jr.,  general manager of Harvard Transportation Services.
As a result, the Harvard shuttle’s Boylston Gate stop is now located in  front of the Wigglesworth tunnel between Boylston and Widener Gates. The stops  are shifting to make room for parking spaces across from the Holyoke Center,  Harris said.
Students, sick of fighting their way through throngs of tourists en  route to class, might be happy to hear that the tour buses that once parked by  Widener Gate have now been forced off Mass Ave. They’ve been bumped to Quincy  Street behind the crosswalk bridging Lamont and the Barker Center, Harris said.
