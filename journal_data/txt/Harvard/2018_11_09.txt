After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universities lead. It’s who we are and what we do. We meet complex challenges with sophisticated solutions. On diversity, America’s core challenge, Harvard has been — to some — a gold standard, with its inclusion of women and people of color in admissions and faculty. But there’s one area of Harvard life, opaque to be sure, where its record is likely less than desirable: the diversity of people who work on, and benefit from, our enormous endowment.
Harvard has led the way on diversity in many areas — including significant scholarship funds to allow for need-blind admissions, a push for greater racial and economic diversity in our student body, and visible efforts to broaden the diversity of our faculty and senior administrators. Just as Harvard now routinely makes diversity a crucial component of its academic mission and a priority in its student body, faculty, and administrators, it would be inconsistent not to extend the same commitment to diversity to its investment practices.
On the business side, universities like Harvard routinely seek out and employ minority-owned firms to fulfill core business needs, such as campus maintenance, catering, and security. But, one glaring exception to this commitment has been the university’s failure to select minority and women-owned asset management firms to manage its endowment dollars.
Of the over $500 billion in assets that North American university endowments hold, Harvard holds by far the largest share, with an endowment of $39.2 billion. A single percentage point change in endowment returns can have dramatic consequences.
In several attempts to better returns, Harvard has tried various CEOs and experimented with investment approaches that ultimately fell short. Most recently, Harvard Management Company's newest CEO, N.P. Narvekar, has announced a new strategy to outsource and use external money managers.
During this rapid change, Narvekar should take a moment to consider the makeup and track record of these new money managers he seeks to entrust with the billions in Harvard’s endowment.
The likelihood that these new money managers are white men is extremely high. A 2017 study commissioned by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation revealed that the average mutual fund in the United States has an $47.4 billion of assets under management, compared to $3.8 billion for majority women-owned firms and $2.1 billion for minority-owned firms. Only about 1 percent of $70 trillion in industry assets is managed by minority and women-owned asset management companies.
I love Harvard, and my life has been enriched by the classes I’ve taken, the relationships I’ve built, and the outside-of-classroom experiences I’ve had. As a soon-to-be alumnus of this great institution, I only want the best for the University and am concerned that our current fiscal management practices are not sufficient to ensure the longevity of the University.
In 2003, Dan Rooney, owner and president of the Pittsburgh Steelers and former chairman of the National Football League's diversity initiative, instituted what would become known as the “Rooney Rule,” which mandates that for every open coaching position NFL teams must interview minority candidates. Since 2003, the number of minority head coaches in the NFL has increased by 18. Of these, four have gone on to compete in the Super Bowl over the past 15 years. Talent is equally distributed; opportunity is not.
Research has demonstrated that, on average, the performance of minority and women-owned asset management firms, both in terms of absolute returns and risk-adjusted returns, is often stronger than non-minority owned firms. This is true across asset classes. Minority asset managers are, at best, continuously overlooked, and, at worst, intentionally precluded from managing large institutional investment funds.
Furthermore, the Knight Foundation study found that though there is no statistical difference in performance between minority and women-owned firms and their white counterparts, foundations and endowments are less likely to invest with minority and women-owned firms than other types of institutional investors including public pension funds. This is a mistake.
We know that prioritizing diversity can actually make organizations much more competitive and successful, especially in our constantly evolving economy.
Harvard has a tremendous opportunity and immediate need to engage in this space. But, more importantly, Harvard has a fiduciary responsibility to generate the greatest return to the University’s endowment. We know that it is possible to do both, as evidenced by the University of Chicago, which has been partnering with minority-owned asset management firms to manage a portion of the endowment since 2011.
For Harvard to make a similar commitment, the University will require strong leadership from Narvekar to inform and educate the University’s leadership about investment opportunities with minority and women-owned firms and take steps to seek out and hire these firms. Additionally, it will be imperative for Harvard, its leadership, and other peer institutions to explore their own unconscious biases. Understanding that bias exists, even within the most prestigious educational institutions, is the first step toward deconstructing it and ensuring true diversity and inclusion.
In its process to grow its endowment, Harvard is in a position to craft effective investment strategies that align with its overarching social mission and increase returns, in perpetuity, all while building a stronger economy through the diversification of asset management.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School released a statement on Nov. 1 condemning the Trump administration’s plans to rescind federal recognition of transgender, intersex, and gender non-binary individuals. In doing so, HMS cited its professional duty as an organization of healthcare providers to condemn the federal change as overly simplistic in its understanding of sex.
We applaud the Medical School’s statement, as it seeks to defend trans, intersex, and nonbinary people across the country from discrimination, and we applaud the school for its use of school-specific expertise to do that work. Harvard’s engagement with this issue must go beyond this statement, however, and the rest of Harvard — on both the College- and University-wide levels — must continue to stand up for the rights of community members affected by Trump’s attempt to limit our understanding of gender.
The Medical School’s statement is the appropriate response to the administration’s policy proposal. It addresses the issue by providing evidence and opinions from medical experts, as opposed to a general political pronouncement. However, we believe that a response from the University would be helpful as well. In the current political climate, the Trump administration frequently makes political proposals that threaten our campus communities.
Although the University should be judicious in addressing political issues, it should speak out about policies that could pose a danger to members of the Harvard community. The University should state unequivocally Harvard’s intention to commit itself to protecting those the proposal puts at risk.
In this instance, Harvard should release a statement assuring non-binary, transgender, and intersex members of the Harvard community, from undergraduates and graduate students to faculty and staff, that the University will continue to recognize and validate their identities, ensuring protection against attempts to erase them.
Harvard should acknowledge that this proposal affects members of the community. The University has a responsibility to affirm threatened identities when possible. In making a public statement, Harvard can use its hefty influence to lead the way in standing up for its students and affirming non-binary, transgender, and intersex identities on a national level.
Additionally, Harvard ought to provide systems of support for non-binary students struggling through the ramifications of this proposal. Finally, in light of the failings of our presidential administration, we applaud Massachusetts for leading the way and approving ballot question 3, which reaffirmed the rights of transgender individuals across the state.  As the federal government fails to protect the rights of vulnerable citizens, Massachusetts residents should take solace in the state’s proactive and protective stance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s start with some facts:
Democrats were not going to flip the Senate.
Beto O’Rourke was not going to win Texas. Andrew D. Gillum was not going to win Florida.
No wave was coming to turn every red district and state blue.
But if you had said any of this to the average, politically involved, tweeting-about-how-important-it-is-to-vote Harvard progressive, they would have looked at you in horror, like you had two heads and a blue tail.
Never mind that it was nearly impossible for Democrats to flip the Senate. Never mind that Beto never overtook Cruz in the polls. Never mind that Florida has not made a decent electoral decision since the beginning of time.
Okay, that last one is a joke. (Mostly.)
But the rest stand, and still, none of these facts mattered for Harvard liberals, who live in echo chambers so powerful that they transform hope into fact.
Everyone knows that Harvard students self-segregate into ideological echo chambers, whether through partisan student organizations, closed cultural groups, or even friendships. But during these recent midterm elections, I’ve seen that self-segregation results in blindness. Entrenched in their political silos, students forget the dynamic realities of this country.
For progressive students seeking political change, this is especially troubling, since change is impossible without understanding the realities which limit it. Yet many act as if these limitations simply do not exist.
Just to be clear, I myself am (more than) progressive. I would love to have more progressives in office (seeing Beto knock that smirk off Lyin’ Ted’s face would be the cherry on top). And I admire the work of of all candidates and volunteers during this election season. Campaigning is hard and often thankless, but it is important. Those who work overtime in contested districts deserve praise for their perseverance and their determination to keep fighting in a democracy in which the rules are not always fair.
So my goal is not to undermine the hard work of those working towards flipping counties and states, and I don’t wish to say that this is impossible. But students have forgotten (or perhaps choose to ignore the existence of) the realities which limit the dream of a blue country — that America elected Donald Trump with eyes wide open, that the map is red counties, coast to coast, that most Americans do not identify as liberal.
And when progressives ignore the electorate, they forget that their policies do not reflect constituents, and they lose elections. This week, Twitter was in an uproar after voters rejected Beto’s progressive policy platform. How could Texans not want universal health care, a ban on assault rifles, a path to citizenship for undocumented individuals? But this shock reflected a complete lack of understanding of the fact that, forget deep-red Texas, such policies are not even unanimously desired in the country. Not even close.
Not only do students not understand how deeply split the country is, they don’t understand the other side’s reasoning. I can count on one hand the number of Harvard progressives I know who know conservative arguments on any major political issue. Even less are able to rebut these arguments. And almost no one recognizes that strong arguments on the other side that can reveal major flaws in the progressive framework and that these flaws must be addressed.
Instead, echo chambers convince Harvard progressives that with their genius, they can bring the entire country along to their blue revolution.
So students get caught up in a fantasy of saving this country from conservatives, and they forget that millions choose conservative politics and politicians year after year. Then, instead of trying to understand these voters, student activists create imagined versions of red states and counties, in which all voters need is enlightenment provided by those with Harvard educations in order to see the truth. The Harvard student swoops in, the voters are enlightened, and bam — the state goes blue. It’s a savior complex, rooted in arrogance. In the long run, it achieves nothing.
Because these states are red for a reason, and deep-seated ideologies are fueling the voters on the other side. Often, these ideologies are rooted in staunch racism as well. How many white voters voted for Cruz — the same group that allowed Trump to win? How many rejected Gillum — for reasons that were often explicitly racially motivated?
For those who are other, this racism is impossible to forget. We know what this country is; we were not surprised in 2016. But for ivory-skinned-ivory-tower Harvard liberals, none of this registers. Only their determination to make-America-blue is real.
And even though the system is not always fair, with gerrymandering and institutionalized voter suppression in many places, this does not mean that every election progressives lose is rigged. Rather, every election includes the hundreds of millions of Americans who are not progressive. It includes hundreds of millions of Americans who are convinced either by their conservative ideologies or by their deep rooted racism. We need to understand that these people exist, that there are plenty of them, and that they will not “turn blue” on a Harvard whim.
When progressives don’t understand this, we lose.
So let’s step out of the ivory tower. I know it’s nice here. I know celebrating is tempting. But if Democrats really want to unseat President Trump in 2020, they can’t be content with gaining some ground in midterms (which is common for the party opposing the president). Winning is going to take more than blind hope. Winning is going to take understanding the realities that aren’t so rosy.
So if you’re a progressive who wants change? Step one isn’t phone banking or tweeting or even registering to vote. Step one is seeing America as it is — red, blue, and everything in between.

The Blavatnik Family Foundation plans to donate $200 million to Harvard Medical School, the largest gift in the school’s history, the University announced Thursday morning.
Administrators will rename the school’s 10 academic departments located on its main campus the "Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School." The new institute will encompass social science and basic science research faculties.
“This tremendous act of generosity will speed progress and generate profound and lasting contributions to science and human health,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in the press release announcing the gift.
“In each aspect of the gift, one recognizes not only a deep commitment to supporting outstanding research, but also a fundamental understanding of and respect for the nature of the scientific enterprise — and the hope it holds for all of humanity,” he added.
The gift will fund an array of research initiatives in Longwood, including single-cell sequencing, structural biology, and drug discovery programs. The donation will also create the Blavatnik Harvard Life Lab Longwood, which aims to support biotech and life sciences startups.
“The work that takes place in the labs and clinics across Harvard Medical School embodies the promise of curiosity-driven fundamental research,” Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 wrote. “In that sense, this is a gift to medicine and, indeed, to patients everywhere.”
Len Blavatnik, the billionaire behind the Blavatnik Family Foundation, has donated to Harvard before. A graduate of Harvard Business School, Blavatnik donated to Harvard once in 2007 and again in 2013, when he gave $50 million.
“Harvard has an unsurpassed life science ecosystem, with 15 of the most prestigious academic medical centers and proximity to the bio-tech industry, all collaborating to provide opportunities worldwide to advance science,” Blavatnik wrote in an email.
Blavatnik has a diverse portfolio of business activities, including media, natural resource, and real-estate holdings, and has an estimated net worth of $17 billion, according to Forbes. He has donated to other universities including Oxford in 2010, when he gave £75 million. The university promptly named its school of government after him.
The Oxford donation drew controversy in the British press due to Blavatnik’s business dealings in Russia. A group of academics and Russian dissidents wrote the Guardian a letter calling Blavatnik one of “Vladimir Putin’s associates” and stating that he engaged in unfair “state-sponsored harassment against BP” as part of a coalition of Russian oligarchs.
“Oxford University has a thorough and robust scrutiny process in place with regard to philanthropic giving,” an Oxford spokesperson told the Guardian. “The University is confident in this process and in its outcomes.”
Bacow has also defended Blavatnik, calling him a “distinguished alumnus” and “somebody that we know very well.”
“We’re very comfortable with who Len is,” Bacow told the Boston Globe.
A spokesperson for Blavatnik declined to comment.
The $200-million gift joins a rarefied group of mega-donations to Harvard in recent years, which include a $350 million gift to the School of Public Health and a $400 million gift for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, both of which prompted Harvard to rename the respective schools.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Library of Congress will award English Professor Jorie Graham a national prize for poetry in December, the library announced last week.
Graham, a renowned poet, will receive the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry for “Fast,” a collection of poems she published in 2017.
The Bobbitt Prize, which comes with a $10,000 award, recognizes the most distinguished book of poetry written by an American published in the last two years or the lifetime achievement of an American poet, the library wrote in a press release. The winner is selected by a panel of judges consisting of poets and literary scholars who are chosen by affiliates of the Library of Congress, the largest library in the world.
“Graham's astonishing abstract intelligence is tethered in almost every line by the sensory, by the music of language and wordplay, and by the material world that makes the red sleepmask a father cries out for in his last days into a metaphor for the human ‘timestorm’ we inhabit, share, grieve,” the judges wrote in the press release.
The panel considered 191 books before selecting Graham, according to Betty Sue Flowers, one of the judges on the panel and the former director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library.
“Each of us, independently, put Graham in our top ten list. That, in itself, shows remarkable consensus,” Flowers wrote in an email.
Graham could not be reached for comment, but pointed to her personal website, which showcases her work and interviews with media outlets.
Graham is the author of more than a dozen books of poetry. She has received several accolades, including the MacArthur Fellowship in 1990 and the Pulitzer Prize in 1996.
“Fast,” her most recent collection, grapples with the changing nature of the modern world spurred on by technological advances, according to her website.
“‘Fast’ lights up the border of our new condition as individuals and as a species on the brink,” Graham’s website reads.
Guggenheim Fellow and acclaimed poet Catherine Barnett, another judge on the panel, wrote in an emailed statement that “Fast” is a “gorgeous” collection.
“This is a book that feels as if were written during a death watch, at the speed of light,” Barnett wrote.
Joshua D. Bell, a senior lecturer on poetry in the English department, called Graham one of America’s “finest poets.”
“I love ‘Fast’. It's maybe her most intense and astonishing book yet, and that's saying something,” Bell wrote in an email.
Graham will receive the award on Dec. 6 at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.. At the ceremony, she will also give a reading of her poetry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Classroom to Table — a popular College initiative that subsidizes fine dining for students and their professors in Harvard Square — has run out of funding for the third consecutive year.
“As we stated at the start of the term, program funding is limited,” a Monday afternoon update to the program webpage reads. “We have had a very successful term and have reached our funding limit.”
The program, which was first piloted in 2015, gathers three to five undergraduates and a professor for a meal at a local restaurant; this semester’s options included Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, The Hourly Oyster House, and Temple Bar. The Office of Undergraduate Education pays up to $30 per attendee, excluding alcohol.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the program has “exceeded our projections” but will be open to student reservations early in the spring semester.`
An estimated 406 Classroom to Table gatherings — including more than 2000 individual student and faculty portions — will occur by the end of the fall semester, according to data provided by Harvard. Last fall, there were a total of 894 such feasts — more than twice as many as in the current term.
In an effort to fairly distribute funds in light of skyrocketing demand, the OUE has imposed progressively stricter rules checking student participation. In its early years, the program allowed students to eat an unlimited number of meals on Harvard’s dime. After running out of money in spring 2017, a cap of four meals per student was instituted last fall and slashed to two meals in the spring.
Classroom to Table levied still further measures to quell overwhelming interest in spring 2018, limiting restaurant options and restricting online sign-up form access to business hours. Yet the program once again shut down early.
Students and faculty emphatically praise Classroom to Table for fostering personal connections between undergraduates and their professors. Peter Der Manuelian ’81 — an Egyptology professor who teaches the popular course Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes” — wrote in an email that the program is a “wonderful two-way street” for student-faculty discourse that he wished would always be available.
“Students get acquainted with professors ‘off stage,’ and we faculty in turn learn much about students’ interests, hopes, and concerns, all in an informal setting with plenty of good cheer,” Manuelian wrote. “In an ideal world, I would love to see this program available at any and all times during the academic year.
Kelsey Ichikawa ’20 wrote that she enjoys Classroom to Table because it is an opportunity to engage with professors in non-academic conversations that would be “a lot harder to have in class or office hours.” She said she believes it’s “really unfortunate” that funding ran out this semester.
“It makes sense that the program is so popular, because it is such an awesome and rare opportunity to interface with faculty in small, less overtly academic settings,” Ichikawa wrote.
For students in the process of scheduling meals with their professors this fall, Monday’s news came as a unpleasant surprise.
Molly K. Leavens ’19 spent several weeks trying to coordinate a time that would be convenient for her classmates’ and professors’ busy schedules. Upon receiving an email from her art history professors, she excitedly went to the Classroom to Table website to book a reservation — only to find that the form had just closed “without warning.”
“We went to confirm, and we were about an hour late,” Leavens said.
The group emailed the OUE hoping that an exception might be made because of their planning efforts, but their plea fell on deaf ears.
“We showed them the emails that we'd sent back in October, and I wish they could've been able to honor those,” Leavens said. “It was embarrassing on us to have made these plans with the professors and then have to be like oh, sorry, actually this isn't something that's possible this semester.”
Despite feelings of disappointment around campus, Dane wrote that Harvard is aware of enthusiasm for the program and considers it a “top priority” in fundraising.
“Harvard College values the Classroom to Table program, which seeks to foster conversation and academic connection among undergraduate students to create additional opportunities for intellectual, personal, and social transformation,“ Dane wrote. “We know that students and faculty alike value this program too (as noted by its high participation rates) and, as such, the College has made it a top priority in our fundraising efforts.”
Dane declined to comment on how funds for the program are sourced. Previously, the meals have been subsidized in part by Senior Gift — an initiative aimed at encouraging each year’s graduates to donate to financial aid and an “unrestricted fund” at the College.
Not all Harvard affiliates are discouraged by the funding news, however. Government Professor Steven R. Levitsky wrote in an email that he views it as a sign of the program’s success.
“It’s good news, in a sense. It means the program is working,” Levitsky wrote. “Students and faculty see value in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The First Year Retreat and Experience — a new pre-orientation program tailored towards under-resourced freshmen — hosted a showcase of student performances at the Smith Campus Center Thursday night.
The purpose of the event — titled “Make This Yours: Forging Community on Campus” — was to celebrate “belonging in the context of identity and intersectionality at Harvard,” according to fliers posted around campus about the event.
The program, which a few dozen students attended, included performances ranging from spoken word poetry to a capella and dance.
Regina M. Cusing ’20, a team leader for FYRE, organized the event with James A. Bedford ’20, one of the student co-chairs of FYRE. According to Bedford, they hoped Thursday’s event would make students feel more welcome on campus.
“Gina and I were talking one day and thinking about how students often feel disenchanted with the social life on campus or feel like they don’t own this campus or they don’t belong to this campus like they should,” Bedford said. “So we decided, why don’t we make an event under FYRE with the values that FYRE holds and just bring some people together to celebrate the community and celebrate diversity?”
The evening began with a panel of two undergraduates — Leonardo A. Garcia ’21 and Debolina Ghosh ’21 — and graduate student Aaron T. Jennings speaking about their experiences navigating life and finding a sense of belonging at Harvard.
After the event, Jennings reflected on his motivation for sharing his experiences at the event as a graduate student.
“I think it’s impactful and powerful for graduate students... to reach back to share, to help students who are first, second, third year, undergraduates period, letting them know that what they’re feeling and experiencing, it’s real it’s true, but also letting them know that they can overcome it,” he said.
The panel was followed by a sequence of student performances. Some students first took the stage to recite spoken word poetry and sing original music. The “East Asian-interest” a capella group Fusian then performed the song “Yellow” from the “Crazy Rich Asians” movie soundtrack. The event finished with performances by the Harvard Asian American Dance Troupe and five members of student musical group 21 Colorful Crimson.
Cusing said after the event that the showcase met FYRE’s expectations of bringing people closer together.
“It reached the kind of intimacy we were hoping for,” Cusing said. “I think that having that level of intimacy in such a new and kind of daunting Harvard space on this campus was just a very cool thing to be able to create.”
“I think it really spoke to the message of what the event was supposed to be for, of the ability to create a feeling of belonging and community wherever you are on this campus,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of sophomores returned to Annenberg Hall to celebrate the declaration of their academic concentrations at a classwide event Thursday night.
The event, co-sponsored by the Undergraduate Council, Dean of Students Office, Advising Programs Office, and the Harvard Coop, saw students reuniting with friends from other Houses in the dining hall used by all first-year students, taking photos, and snacking on refreshments.
UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 said the Council was motivated to ensure this year’s event came to fruition after last year’s fell through.
“We started talking about this event last year, and the space was booked before the school year even started in preparation for it,” she said.
In addition to the light-hearted photo opportunities and raffles scattered throughout the dining hall, an activity planned by the UC gave students the opportunity to write a postcard about their concentration declaration to themselves.
Zhang said the event was designed to encourage students “to take a moment and stop and reflect on why they decided to declare their concentration.”
“When we met as a student group, we thought that it was important to not only celebrate the class being together — which is why we had food, photo booths — but we also thought that it’s a really important time in students’ journeys, especially through their academic and Harvard journeys,” she said.
Students attending the event said they enjoyed the opportunity to see friends from other Houses. Freshmen are sorted into 12 upperclassmen Houses each spring, a process that sometimes separates friends.
“I’m seeing a lot of people I haven’t seen in a while,” Kevin L. Bi ’21, a newly minted Applied Math concentrator, said.
“I’m super pumped to have all my friends together in Annenberg again,” Ami Ishikawa ’21, a new Economics concentrator, said. “Coming back here, seeing everyone catching up, taking pictures, it’s a lot of fun.”
Some students reported feeling mixed emotions about the declaration process.
Austin Y. Hwang ’21, a Computer Science concentrator, said he felt the declaration itself was somewhat constraining.
“I waited until the really last minute because I don’t really like the sense of permanence,” he said. “I still want to explore other things and I feel like officially declaring makes it really permanent even though I know Harvard is very flexible on these things.”
Sarah J. Rodriguez ’21, meanwhile, said she felt relieved to declare a joint concentration in Philosophy and Social Studies.
“It’s nice; there’s some certainty to it,” she said. “There’s a sense of identity that comes with it.”
Manasi Maheshwari ’21, a Computer Science concentrator, said she was excited about the wide range of uses for her new concentration.
“I’m taking an education class right now which really stresses the importance of transforming education, and I think technology is a great way to do that,” she said. “It gives me the opportunity to make the change that I want to see in the world.”

Theologian Janet E. Smith delved into the Catholic Church’s stance on sex and sexuality in a lecture hosted by the Catholic Student Association in Emerson Hall Thursday evening.
The event was the capstone of the inaugural Catholic Sex Week, a series of talks organized by the CSA intended to provoke thought and discussion about the relationship between faith and sexuality. It follows last week’s Harvard Sex Week, an annual series of workshops, lectures, and discussions that aim to empower and educate College students on sexuality and sexual health
Smith, a professor of moral theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, a Catholic teaching institution in Detroit, and member of the Catholic Church’s Pontifical Council on the Family, spoke on why the Church prohibits premarital sex and the use of artificial contraceptives. Her talk drew several dozen Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents.
Smith said her position is based on the idea that sex should be a commitment to parenthood.
“Contraceptive sex is all about the physical relationship,” she said. “You don’t have to know a person, it’s just two faceless people in a sensual moment. When you engage in a sexual act — [Pope] John Paul II says — the very act says, ‘I’m willing to be a parent with you.’”
In a 90-minute speech delivered without notes, Smith spoke on the differences she perceives between men and women, especially in terms of what drives them to have sex.
“Men learn to love because they want sex, and women learn to love sex so that they can have love,” she said.
Smith’s talk followed two other events centered more specifically on the use of contraception. The week kicked off with a discussion led by Patrick J. Fiorillo, undergraduate chaplain at the Harvard Catholic Center, on Humanae Vitae, a 50-year-old papal order written by Pope Paul VI banning artificial contraception. Fiorillo’s talk was followed on Wednesday by personal testimony about the Humanae Vitae by married couple Steve and Helene Bowler of Hudson, Mass.
CSA Steering Committee member John H. Clark ’19 said Catholic Sex Week programming was not a rebuttal to Harvard Sex Week, but rather an extension of the conversation.
“It was more of a catalyst to get us thinking about it rather than a direct response,” Clark said.
After Smith’s speech, several audience members stayed to discuss what they learned, which Clark said was what made Thursday’s event a success.
“That’s the goal; it’s to create conversation. It’s not imposing anything,” Clark said. “I think it’s for us to learn more about what the Catholic Church teaches and for us to then go back to our dorm rooms and our communities and to discuss those and grapple with that.”
Though Catholic Sex Week was primarily attended by members of the CSA, events were open to anyone with interest, according to event organizers.
“It’s as much to educate us as it is to educate those outside of the Catholic circle,” CSA President Connor J. Richardson ’19 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Midterm election night on Tuesday did not escape the notice of Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, who had election coverage on his TV during pregame shootaround in the team’s season opener against MIT. Immediately following the Crimson’s 78-66 victory over the Engineers, the former Duke mainstay likely went back to the remote as important political and basketball results began to stream in. The so-called “blue wave” was equally as potent on the news channels as it was on ESPN, where the No. 4 Blue Devils trounched — to put it lightly — No. 2 Kentucky at the Champions Classic.
Through all of the headlines, it may have been easy to overlook that a regular-season game was actually played here in Cambridge. With the MIT student supporter section filled to the brim, a similar statement could not be said about the Lavietes Pavilion home crowd. For those not in attendance (unless of course, you were streaming on ESPN+), here are the some thoughts from that game as Harvard prepares for its Friday night tilt with New England foe Northeastern.
BALANCED MINUTES
Coach John Calipari famously implemented a platoon system for his highly (highly) decorated 2014-2015 squad featuring the likes of Karl-Anthony Towns and Devin Booker. I should probably spare Coach Cal some agony after quite possibly his worst loss ever on Tuesday night, but what was intriguing is this 5-in, 5-out substitution system was exactly what coach Tommy Amaker executed at the start of the MIT game. At the 15:55 mark, starters Christian Juzang, Rio Haskett, Justin Bassey, Danilo Djuricic, and Chris Lewis were subbed out for the second team: Spencer Freedman, Noah Kirkwood, Corey Johnson, Robert Baker, and Henry Welsh. The five-some were all replaced at the second media timeout by the starters.
Coach Amaker’s new catchword this year seems to be “sacrifice”, and it doesn’t take too much into reading the leaves to see connotations to a remarkably deep bench and of course, the need for some members of the team to take a slight hit on minutes.
Here’s Tommy’s explanation for his Calipari-esque attempt early on in the game (the team reverted back to individual-subbing following Lewis’s second foul at the eight-minute mark).
“I was anxious to see [the substitution scheme]," Amaker said.“One of the things we're going to try to see if we can do this year is use our depth...our depth was sensational you look at our points off the bench, to there's we get 35 points...we talk about our bench and our balance a lot.”
One more thing on the “bench and balance” line. All ten of those aforementioned players logged more than 10 minutes, and everyone of them scored at least a basket. Of course opponent quality is a factor, but something to keep an eye on as this team adds four freshmen (two in Kirkwood and Freedman who saw quality minutes Tuesday) to the mix.
KIRKWOOD IMPRESSES
Oh yea, Noah. Let’s just say that outside of the good ol’ consistent back-to-basket, old-school style of play that is Chris Lewis (who put up a team-high 20 points in only 15 minutes of action), the first year Canadian that is Noah Kirkwood is quickly becoming Amaker’s lead perimeter threat, pending Ivy League Player of the Year Seth Towns’ and Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken’s return.
In the first half alone, Kirkwood went 4-of-5 with two treys and 10 points. His first career basket? A step-back, nonchalant three from the top of the arc that could only be described as smooth. The versatile 6’ 7” wing also showed promise in attacking the basket and drew separation with his iso play throughout the game, landing him a 13-point total for the game. Four turnovers is the slight blip, but a Towns-Kirkwood combo in the near future will be a sight to see.
And for the more analytically-inclined, Kirkwood landed a USG% percentage (how many team plays were used by the player) of 33.4, trailing only Chris Lewis among those who played substantial minutes. Let’s just say we will see a lot of plays in the hands of the young man from Ontario this season.
PROBLEMS IN THE RESTRICTED AREA
For an MIT team whose tallest player is listed at 6’ 7” and heaviest at 215 pounds, let’s just say way too many plays on the defensive end landed in easy finishes at the rim or offensive rebounds. Ball distribution among coach Larry Anderson’s squad in terms of a fast-moving motion offense was particularly effective in the opening frame, when MIT took the lead for a brief period of time and went back to the locker rooms trailing by just one point.
The Engineers outrebounded the Crimson 20 to 12 in the first half, with 11 offensive rebounds. Anderson’s side also attempted 19 layups with nine conversions and eight total assists in the 40-39 set. Having Lewis in foul trouble that first frame did not help, but interior lapses will be something to be addressed in the games ahead. The other sore spot on the stat sheet? 18 turnovers. Amaker acknowledged that the team was trying to play faster transition offense in this game, but noted a few(namely he recalled six), that were “silly turnovers.”
OUTLOOK AGAINST NORTHEASTERN
The Huskies took a tough loss in its opener against Boston University, despite star captain Vasa Pusica’s 31 points. Northeastern led by 12 in the second frame but could not withstand a late run from its Boston neighbors.
In last year’s competition over at Matthews Arena, Harvard fell to Bill Coen’s side 77-61 with Pusica leading the way with 22 points. Coen’s six-man rotation against the Terriers featured a small guard duo in redshirt juniors Donnell Greshman Jr. and Jordan Roland complemented by imposing 6’ 10” senior Anthony Green who logged a 71.6 field goal conversion percentage last season. Junior wing Brace Bolden was last year’s CAA Sixth Man of the Year and is a threat from deep, averaging 39.6 percent last season.
This one should come down to the wire, and a better mental game in terms of fewer turnovers, tighter interior defense, and more cognizant defensive rebounding will be critical for Harvard to jump out to a 2-0 start on the season.
Current KenPom Rankings:
81- Harvard
91- Northeastern

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One win.
That’s how far away Hunter Ladnier was from securing a spot in last year’s NCAA Championships. Though the Crimson combatant clawed his way to the top of last season’s NCAA qualifiers, he was ultimately taken down by Navy’s Jared Prince in his semifinal match.
However, Ladnier, now a junior and captain of the Harvard wrestling team, plans on turning that around this year. Having made it to the NCAA Championships during his freshman season, a successful run at this year’s EIWA Championships would secure a second appearance in the NCAA tournament for the Ohio native. And, according to Harvard wrestling coach Jay Weiss, the premier competition in college wrestling may just be coated in crimson this year.
“When we drew it up in the preseason, we saw that a lot of guys have the potential [to go to the NCAA Championships], but they have to be doing the right things,” said Weiss, who is beginning his 25th year with the team. “I’m very confident in a lot of guys on the team, like our captain Hunter Ladnier, who’s a junior. He qualified as a freshman and barely missed out last year, and I’m definitely liking what I see out of him right now. We also have a couple guys that placed at the EIWAs last year that have a lot of potential this year: Nolan [Hellickson] placed, and Brock Wilson placed last year as a freshman, so he’s got a great shot as a sophomore.”
For the Crimson, the journey to the NCAA Championships is a long one. Because the wrestling season doesn’t truly begin until mid-November, the team’s preseason training is “very long,” as Weiss puts it. However, this drawn-out practice period just adds to the wrestlers’ dedication.
“Everyone’s been working hard this preseason, so we’re all super excited to be able to lay it on the line,” Ladnier said. “Everyone’s upbeat and has a lot of energy, and we’re all just excited because we’ve been working hard since the preseason.”
As the wrestlers prepare for this weekend’s Jonathan Kaloust Bearcat Open, Harvard’s first bout of the season, the competitors in crimson are enthusiastic to break from their typical schedule.
“Practice is great a way for us to see how the wrestlers are against each other, but now we get to go out and see how they carry out a team plan and adjust,” Weiss said. “I feel that a tournament like this weekend is worth two weeks of practice. I think the team’s mentality is very hungry and excited — it’s a relief to get out of our practice routine and start competing.”
Though the team differs from other Crimson squads in that it lacks a substantial senior class, the Harvard team is expected to be one of the best in the Ivy League this season. Weiss cites the experience of his juniors and sophomores, along with the potential of his team’s freshmen, as overall strengths for the squad.
“We got some freshmen that are going to be a surprise on the lineup,” Weiss said. “It’s very exciting when you see someone which that kind of high level ability at that age. Josh Kim is a freshman and already doing great things, and we have a lot of guys that really can do some damage at the end of the year. It’s really just a matter of how we navigate the season.”
However, wrestling isn’t the only activity that the team has been focusing on. The Crimson holds the distinction of having earned the highest cumulative team GPA in the country for three years in a row, an achievement that the squad holds high. This year, Harvard plans on turning three years straight into four.
“Six out of the last seven years, we’ve had the number one [GPA in the country], which is a goal of our program,” Weiss said. “[The team is] expected to do that, and they understand that that’s their goal. I think it just goes hand-in-hand with a commitment to being great — being great on the mat, being great in the classroom, and being a great person.”
This mantra of being great is one that Coach Weiss repeats frequently. Ask any Harvard wrestler and they’ll tell you that striving for greatness is the team’s foremost ambition, both on the mat and in the classroom.
“Coach Weiss expects that you’re going to be great both inside and outside the wrestling room, so guys work hard in the classroom,” Ladnier said. “We have an academic committee, where we have certain guys on the team that make sure everyone’s on top of their work. You can come here to just be a wrestler, or you can come here and try to be great. Coach Weiss really emphasizes how important it is to be great and to work hard outside of wrestling, so obviously we’re going to put work in outside the wrestling room.”
As the wrestlers head to Binghamton, N.Y. this weekend, Coach Weiss’s mantra will almost certainly be on their minds. After months of tough training and impassioned practice, the Crimson is ready to face its first battle. And for the Harvard wrestlers, greatness is only a few pins away.

Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Princeton, Yale.
Harvard football’s current crop of seniors has defeated each of these teams at least once during its tenure in Cambridge. One Ivy foe is conspicuously absent from that list: Penn.
In 2015, Penn spoiled the Crimson’s bid for an undefeated season by marching into Harvard Stadium and outscoring the home team, 14-0, in the second half to pull away with a 35-25 victory. The next year, Harvard traveled to Philadelphia and lost by 13 in a Friday night showdown. Last season, the Quakers further increased their margin of victory with a 23-6 triumph.
This year, Harvard (4-4, 2-3 Ivy) again hits the road to take on Penn (6-2, 3-2). The Quakers have pieced together three separate two-game win streaks this season, broken up by losses to Dartmouth and Yale. Penn looks to continue its recent winning ways, while Harvard aims to break a three-year stretch of futility against its southernmost Ivy foe.
“They’ve just been — similar to us — so good for so long,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They’ve got another really, really good football team. Are they a tiny notch below Dartmouth and Princeton? Evidently. But they’re really good and their personality always starts with defense. Defense is always a strength at Penn, and this team is no different.”
Aside from conference juggernauts Princeton and Dartmouth, Penn has by far the lowest scoring defense among the remaining Ivy teams. The Quakers have allowed an average of 17.3 points per game and only once has an opponent posted 30 or more points (Dartmouth, 37). Additionally, Penn has only conceded two touchdowns across its last two games combined.
All three levels of this Saturday’s host’s defense are formidable. Up front, the Quakers boast a unit that leads the league by a considerable margin in sacks (29). Last season, Nick Miller was named a first-team All-Ivy linebacker. In the secondary, Penn has accumulated eight interceptions, tied with Harvard.
“It doesn’t matter whether you’re looking at it front-to-back or back-to-front, they don’t have any weaknesses,” Murphy said. “When you watch the film it’s really hard to identify ... how to attack them.”
Harvard and Penn are somewhat similar teams in construction and philosophy. Harvard prides itself on its defense and Murphy believes that the defense paves the way for the team’s overall success, a sentiment that Quakers coach Ray Priore would likely echo.
“Whether it’s Alabama, whether it’s Clemson, whether it’s Harvard, whether it’s Penn, it all starts with defense and we really, really believe in how important that is in recruiting, in development, and in emphasis,” Murphy said.
Penn’s offense, while not as fearsome at a mere 20.6 points per game, could still cause Harvard some trouble. It plays a very traditional style predicated upon the run game and short passes. Senior defensive tackle Richie Ryan notes that he and his fellow linemen may have their work cut out for them due to the Quakers’ tendency to read the defensive tackles and make a call based on their positioning and movements.
“They want to run it down your throat and they want to play hard-nosed, old-school football, so I like it,” Ryan said.
Noticeably absent from Penn’s offensive attack this time around is wide receiver Justin Watson. Watson, now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was a menace against the Crimson. In the three most recent matchups between Harvard and Penn, the wideout racked up 317 receiving yards and four touchdowns. Most notable was his performance in the Quakers’ 35-25 win in 2015 — the then-sophomore tallied 249 total yards on just five carries and seven receptions and also found the end zone twice.
This time around, the ground attack will likely be more prominent for Priore and his offense. Led by junior Karekin Brooks, the Penn backfield is averaging 196.3 rushing yards per contest. Brooks is responsible for 107.6 of those on average, and he has also scored eight times.
“He’s got power and he has speed,” Murphy said. “He was a highly-recruited kid out of Georgia. He’s broken some big runs. When things are tight, he’s tough, he’s physical. He’s definitely one of the top two running backs in the league.”
Harvard has lost more frequently on the road in recent memory, but its string of road conquests would have been hard for any team to maintain, as it had a 16-game winning streak as the visiting team broken during the 2016 campaign. Murphy and his players still keep up the “road warrior” mentality, and that attitude will be crucial as the Crimson prepares for its final away game of 2018.
“These Penn guys, they get amped up, they’re a different animal at home,” captain Zach Miller said. “Being a road warrior is just getting rid of all the distractions and focusing on playing football, getting yourself mentally and physically prepared to go out there and battle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — The Harvard men's hockey team has not been winless through the first four games of the season since 1940. The Crimson (0-2-1. 0-2-1 ECAC) will look to keep that streak unbroken at Ingalls Rink tonight as it takes on rival Yale (2-1-0, 2-1-0). The Bulldogs are coming off a decisive 4-2 win at Colgate, while Harvard skated to a hard-fought 4-4 tie against Princeton last Saturday.
The Crimson is used to dominating the Elis in recent years, but last season Yale swept Harvard in the season series. Each of the two teams will be looking to make a mark in this contest, as the Crimson looks for revenge and two points on the night.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. — The Harvard men’s hockey team clashed with storied rival Yale on Friday night in a game defined by crushing hits, momentum swings, and clutch goals. The game seemingly had everything — everything but a decisive result.
The Crimson (0-2-2, 0-2-2 ECAC) and the Bulldogs (2-1-1, 2-1-1) skated to a 3-3 draw after 65 minutes of hockey, leaving the sold-out Ingalls Rink crowd dissatisfied. Harvard is still in search of its first outright victory of the season and has failed to notch a win through its first four regular-season bouts for the first time since 1940.
“I liked our resilience,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We kept coming, made a lot of good plays. Obviously, we would’ve liked to hold onto the lead there at the end…. All in all, we had a lot of guys that showed a lot of determination and grit.”
More than halfway through the second period, a physical shift ended with sophomore forward Jack Badini suffering a rough collision at the corner-boards to the left his net-minder, senior Michael Lackey. The game was never the same after that point.
Both benches were charged, the crowd was at its loudest, and over the course of a single shift, the contest grew into yet another intense installment of the Harvard-Yale rivalry.
“I think I’ve played Yale nine times now, and it’s always between one or two goals,” co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage said. “We knew, especially playing in their rink with their atmosphere, that they were going to come out flying. I think we did a good job managing the atmosphere and playing a full 60.”
After tempers settled from the Badini hit and play resumed, sophomore forward Henry Bowlby was whistled for tripping on the ensuing shift. The Bulldogs cashed in on their powerplay chance just seconds into the man-up opportunity, courtesy of rookie blue-liner Jack St. Ivany. The tally, coming with five minutes remaining in the frame, was his first career goal.
“It’s kind of par for the course here,” coach Donato said. “It seems like the games get very physical and chippy, but all in all I thought it was just a really good competitive hockey game.”
Three minutes after the St. Ivany strike, Yale followed up with another score and had stolen momentum from the Crimson in a matter of minutes. Then, two of Harvard’s keystone players made a late-period statement, altering the complexion of the game heading into the final stanza.
In the last minute of the second frame, junior defenseman Adam Fox beat a Bulldog forechecker to a loose puck in the right corner and, without taking a single touch to corral it first, slung the biscuit to the opposite blue line, where Zerter-Gossage broke into the zone and buried the in-alone chance.
“I try as hard as I can to come up big in big moments,” Zerter-Gossage said. “That circumstance is a pretty lucky bounce, but I got a breakaway off a change…. I’m glad that I was able to bear down and score on that opportunity, and I think that it rallied the guys.”
Despite the whirlwind latter half of the middle period, the teams entered the locker rooms after 40 minutes knotted at two goals apiece, and the drama was far from over.
With just 10 minutes remaining in the tilt, Bowlby took a gruesome hit at the jut-out between his own bench and the boards. The silver lining to this dangerous play was that the Crimson headed to the powerplay.
On the man-advantage, the point-men worked the puck down to freshman forward Jack Drury, who threw a no-look backhand pass across the crease to an open Reilly Walsh. The sophomore rearguard punched in the puck, giving Harvard the 3-2 lead.
Before the bench celebration had even fully subsided, the Bulldogs earned one back. Senior Joe Snively, Yale’s most dangerous weapon up front, was the culprit. The game-tying goal was Snively’s fourth of the year, and it would prove to be the game’s final tally.
“That’s been a pretty familiar feeling so far this year,” Zerter-Gossage said. “Looking back at our first game, we battled back from opposing goals a bunch of times…. So [rapid lead changes are] nothing we haven’t seen before. It’s really frustrating because we feel like we worked really hard to get to that spot.”
For the first time this season, it was Harvard who opened the scoring. Six minutes into the second period, Fox had possession of the puck at the left point and shuffled it down to Bowlby at the half-wall. Bowlby zipped the puck into the high slot, where freshman forward Casey Dornbach sent a one-timer toward the cage.
Yale goaltender Corbin Kaczperski could not see through a screen posted by Drury, and the puck found its way to the back of the net.
Continuing a trend from the Crimson’s first three contests, the group’s underclassmen played a large role in the scoring effort, notching five of the team’s nine total points. The line of Dornbach and Bowlby centered by Drury continues to be Harvard’s most effective trio up front.
The opening frame, while it ended in a scoreless stalemate, saw high-quality chances for both squads. Harvard, leading 10-7 in shots after 20 minutes, was pleased with its performance out of the gate after wanting more from its starts to games early in the season.
“[A good start] is something that we’ve been really harping on,” Zerter-Gossage said. “That’s something that has kind of caused us struggles through the first few games, is that we get down early and we’re playing catch-up. We still haven’t really played with a lead this year, and that’s something that we know we have to start doing if we want to win games.”
Between the pipes, Lackey (3 GA, .914 SV%) looked to improve upon his prior two performances in 2018-2019. After ceding a combined 11 goals in his previous pair of starts coming into Friday’s clash, the goaltender was fighting to cement his role as the team’s starter.
Both Lackey and Kaczperski stood tall at times but also allowed crucial goals. This much is to be expected, however, in such a high-event game in a raucous barn.
Friday’s latest installment of the Harvard-Yale hockey rivalry did not disappoint. As usual, the arena was booming, emotions came through, and momentum was won and lost in the span of a single shift.
The Crimson turns its attention to Brown on Saturday night, still looking for its first victory of the season.
“This was a really good growing up moment for a lot of our young guys,” coach Donato said. “We’re getting better. We’re obviously a little frustrated and disappointed with getting one point being up a goal, but it just makes tomorrow night even more important.”
