After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
”The Big Green Tent,” the latest novel from Russian literary giant Ludmila Ulitskaya, opens with the story of three young boys, Ilya, Mikha, and Sanya, as they meet and become fast friends. Students in a Moscow school during the post-Stalin years of the Soviet Union, they call their trio the Trianon. But while “The Big Green Tent” begins and ends with the Trianon, for much of the book Ulitskaya concerns herself with creating an engaging and massive tableau of Russia that spans hundreds of miles and tens of years. As the book leaps effortlessly from year to year, character to character, it ingeniously tells the story of a generation that is at the same time in love with and at war with its homeland.
The middle pages read less like a novel and more like a series of interconnected short stories, a structure that Ulitskaya uses to enforce the idea that the book is both about the larger picture and simultaneously the small and seemingly meaningless details of life. This effect serves to paint a broad picture of the Soviet Union, but it means that many characters blur together and become regrettably vague as the chapters pass. In this way, Ulitskaya makes time malleable and lets the thread of narrative independently weave its way through the book. Much of the novel is centered around Ilya, a dissident photographer and distributer of samizdat (banned literature); his wife Olga, the daughter of a general who is expelled from university for defending an anti-Soviet professor; and their varied acquaintances. Yet the chapter where Olga appears, only a scant hundred pages into the book, is the chapter where she and Ilya die.
One could say the rest of the book is merely filling in the blanks, but this excessiveness also points to Ulitskaya’s apparent desire to tell not just the story of her characters but of Russia itself. Ulitskaya’s fascinating cast of characters, ranging from a dissident cartoonist in exile to a book binder by the name of King Arthur, are enormously vibrant and varied, though ultimately forgettable. Some are an exception to this rule, and the stories of the idealistic Mikha, whose death is the result of an unending series of well-meaning but disastrous decisions, or Sanya, a disabled piano player who can no longer play and retreats into the world of theory, leave a lasting impression. Instead focussing on making her characters memorable and compelling, Ulitskaya uses “The Big Green Tent” to illustrate the sprawling nature of the late Soviet Union through this structure of interconnected small vignettes. The satisfaction of finding clever connections makes the seemingly unrelated chapters a joy to follow.
Threading throughout the novel is a great love of literature that, through Ulitskaya’s prose, proves to be infectious. “The Big Green Tent” imparts at least a cursory knowledge of the greatest names in Russian literature, poetry, and music: Pushkin, Tolstoy, Pasternak, and their ilk are always on the tongues of Ulitskaya’s characters. Books serve as inspiration for the Trianon after the boys’ Russian literature teacher opens their minds to the world of the written page. In a society oppressed by the ever-watching eyes of the government, books become both an escape into another world and a way of rebelling against the regime. “It all seemed trivial and unimportant,” proclaims Mikha as he finishes a new piece of samizdat. “He felt guilty for merely living, while Daniel, this marvelous writer, had penetrated to the very essence of their current life.” Ulitskaya uses these bursts of adoration from her characters to show the power of written word, which translates skillfully across the pages of her own literary work.
This love of literature is not without its dark side, as Ulitskaya shows more and more in the later chapters. By dualistically presenting art as salvation and destruction, she makes art’s two-sided nature emerge slowly, but this conceptualization of art as a potentially destructive force soon becomes a central question and is one of the most engaging themes of the work. Art is both what helps the Trianon grow into adulthood and what teaches them the necessities of life; at the same time it is what attracts the attention of the KGB and sends their lives spiralling into despair. It leads to both life’s pleasures and pains, and could be said to be life itself. Yet if one considers art to be life itself, can one surrender it just to conform to the needs of the state? Ulitskaya navigates through these dark themes with a deft hand, lending the book a deeply philosophical nature that naturally complements its use of cleverly connected storytelling.
“The Big Green Tent” is massive in both length and scope. Its myriad of interconnections make it a delight to read, and the plethora of themes lend it a depth that inspires questioning and deliberation. Ulitskaya is a realist but a relatable one, and her characters are fascinating and diverse if at times forgettable and opaque. With its enormous cast, numerous pages, and subtle exploration of themes, it is not a book one may quickly breeze through, but Ulitskaya’s epic will reward patience, a love of literature, and an eye for detail with a brutally stark portrait of her homeland’s darkest years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A recent article in The Crimson reports a largely favorable assessment of the major restructuring of the Harvard library system in 2012 into a single, centralized administration. According to the article, the library has saved $25 million since 2009, most of this attributable to policy changes enacted between 2010 and 2012, in which the University "reshuffled and streamlined administrative positions in the library system to reduce inefficiencies and reallocate resources to better balance the needs of a centralized library."
A central aspect of this "streamlining" was the creation of a new "shared services" bureaucracy that was supposed to allow a smaller organization to perform its tasks more efficiently by pooling resources and minimizing duplication throughout the library system. For staff such as myself, the reality of "shared services" on the ground has been the creation of a highly inefficient system of bureaucratic fragmentation, with staff at each library divided both between local and shared contingents, and with shared services staff now accountable to separate offsite managers.
In technical services, our experience suggests that budgetary savings since 2012 have been due not to increased efficiency, but rather to severe cuts in quality and to the outsourcing of library work. These trends have allowed the library to continue processing books with smaller staffing, but this has come at the sacrifice both of the quality of its collections and of its contractual commitments to its employees.
In February of 2014, I participated in a workflow initiative on copy-cataloging aimed at harnessing the supposed new advantages of the integrated library system. Although we were led to believe that the workflow initiative would allow staff to develop new policies in a participatory way, in reality, we were handed a set of policies prepared in advance by managers and expected to approve them with little or no revision. Several of us expressed strong concerns that the new policy guidelines would severely reduce the quality of cataloging at Harvard, and thus reduce the ability of patrons to find materials in our collections. Our concerns were strong enough that all five of the copy-catalogers working on the project resigned. The new standards were nevertheless adopted by central administration for processing books in the main library collection.
It seemed clear to the copy catalogers involved in the project that the new cataloging standards were designed to facilitate outsourcing by allowing substandard vendor supplied cataloging to be accepted without meaningful revision by staff. These new, reduced cataloging standards are now being used to overlook the errors already found in a recently introduced workflow called "direct to destination" where outside, for-profit companies catalog for Harvard and send titles directly to shelf without review by local expert staff.
This is now the overall trend in the Harvard Library: In collection development and technical processing, there is now a strong impetus from central administration to outsource work to vendors wherever possible. More and more books are purchased on blanket orders with cataloging and shelf-ready processing supplied by vendors. This means that our collections are less and less often being conscientiously built by trained bibliographers who know both the collections and the needs of the disciplines they serve, and more and more by vendors with a narrow interest in selling books.
Librarians and library staff at all levels have a basic accountability to the university and the intellectual mission it serves. By outsourcing our work to vendors, Harvard is ceding the independent function of the library as a curator of information in the service of knowledge to a handful of private corporations whose main interest lies in maximizing profits.
In the short term, such policies may look good to people concerned about budgetary savings, but the long term cost to the quality of Harvard's collections may be inestimable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1995, scholar George Lipsitz wrote about a “possessive investment in whiteness.” Against whiteness everything else is othered: “As the unmarked category against which difference is constructed, whiteness never has to speak its name, never has to acknowledge its role as an organizing principle in social and cultural relations.” I read this text in Spanish 126, a class called “Performing Latinidad.” Before this class, I felt uncomfortably queasy, uncomfortably radical saying “whiteness.”
At Harvard, there is a whiteness in which we possessively invest. There is a cultural hierarchy, and we have all been in the thick of the woods for a while, climbing towards the snowcap that is whiteness. The climb, whether consciously or subconsciously, is in the way that I choose to dress, the way that I talk, and the communities with which I associate (or perhaps more importantly, do not associate) on campus. It is in the way that I force myself to take seriously the politicians and dignitaries that filter through our campus in the form of white liberalism. It is in the way that I network with them at the reception after the talk. It is floating generally in the air, in the nonchalance and the lack of sufficient anger at what has been happening at Mizzou and Yale. We are all helplessly possessiveness of our pieces of whiteness, because they are the cards you need to succeed at the game given its current rules.
There is a difference between diversity and inclusivity. Diversity is the pie chart on the admissions website, the literal spectrum of skin colors on a subway pole. But inclusivity is about how you accommodate that diversity, without asking that it accommodate the harshness of society in return. Inclusivity is about changing the game rather than being complacent with teaching people how to play it well. If this would have more credibility explained in your classic Western theory, inclusivity is about learning how to free your thoughts from the Weberian “iron cage.” It’s about unleashing our creativity to create a better, more accommodating society. But this is hard, because centuries and centuries of possessive investment in whiteness has done a lot to distance us from our creativity.
This is hard because it requires the empathy earned from releasing a bit of our possessiveness, our self-centered urge to advance in a problematic game. And if empathy is too subjective a term for you, it requires the right vocabulary and the academic knowledge to give flesh to your discomfort, your anger, and your ideas for change.
Empathy. Vocabulary. Creativity. Now, right now, in the intellectual luxury and urgency of college, is the time to work on developing them. The resources are lacking but ever-present at our university in the courses that explore the histories and sociologies of oppression. The past week has been an outpouring of courage and support for the students at Mizzou and at Yale on social media. Next semester, I hope the same people will upgrade their courage to action by enrolling in a class in African American Studies or one of the myriad courses available in ethnic studies through the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights.
These courses are as much disciplines—a term used to describe no more than ways of engaging the world as an academic problem—in their own right as mainstream social science disciplines such as political science and anthropology. If classes in these popularized social sciences have given you fluency in an understanding of the world that has been elevated and perpetuated by structures of power, classes in ethnic studies and in African American Studies will equip you with the empathy needed to even out the playing field.
We need that empathy now, right now, to address what is going on not only at Mizzou and at Yale, but also at Harvard and at every school in the United States. There is no better time than now, right now, to do your mandatory reading.

November 3 was not a great day for Kentuckians who struggle with health insurance costs, Mississippians looking for a real alternative to their incumbent governor, or people vulnerable to discrimination in Houston. Republican Matt Bevin’s election to the governorship of the Bluegrass State means the possible dismantling of its health insurance marketplace set up under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Bevin also wants to make Medicaid recipients enrolled as a result of the law pay more. Remarkably, many Kentuckians who would be most affected by their new governor’s policies gave him their votes, because they were tired of “career politicians” like his Democratic opponent.
In Mississippi, the problems started in the Democratic primary, when trucker and political neophyte Robert Gray won his party’s nomination despite not campaigning. Possible explanations for his victory include his “common name” and his gender. As expected, incumbent Republican Phil Bryant—another foe of health reform, despite his state’s self-evident need for it—won easily in the general election. Meanwhile, 61 percent of Houston voters rejected a non-discrimination ordinance because of the specter of transgender bathroom use—an ugly example of demagoguery and trans-phobia carrying the day, and an unwelcome pre-Veterans Day tribute to those service members who also would have had legal recourse under the measure.
In addition to voters with obvious interests at stake, another group had some troubles on Tuesday: pollsters. The failings of polls were most obvious in Kentucky, where most had Conway winning narrowly instead of losing by almost nine percentage points. Polls in Houston also tended to overestimate support for the equality measure, though they were more accurate. Only in Mississippi, where the Democratic nominee hardly inspired confidence, did polling accurately predict the outcome.
These pitfalls during off-year state and municipal elections might seem unremarkable, but they fit into a wider pattern of polling snafus around the world. In Britain, Poland, and Israel, polls were wide of the mark in major elections earlier this year.
Such concerns were paramount for Harvard History professor Jill Lepore, when she delivered the 26th Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics at the Kennedy School last Friday. As Professor Lepore pointed out in that talk and in a New Yorker article on the same subject, polls have always faced credibility issues, such as in the aftermath of the infamous 1948 election, when President Truman’s reelection was so unexpected that it caught even major newspapers flat-footed. Though the 2016 presidential race has become more poll-dependent, polls are coming under increasing scrutiny as their response rate withers and the emergence of online alternatives raises graver questions of accuracy.
Beyond technical considerations, Lepore argues that our continued infatuation with polls even as their accuracy becomes dubious is a “paradox” that requires explanation. Perhaps most striking, Lepore asks whether polls have a tendency to move politics towards a kind of “direct democracy,” as at least one congressman complained in the 1940s. If a member of Congress supports a bill that she knows (thanks to perfect polling) her constituents do not, should she vote for it? Such is the uncomfortable hypothetical Lepore poses.
Of course, these issues have a long lineage. In his famous 1774 “Speech to the Electors of Bristol,” British conservative politician and political philosopher Edmund Burke articulated what today would be a decidedly anti-polling argument. “If,” Burke argued, “the local constituent should have an interest, or should form an hasty opinion, evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community, the member [of Parliament] for that place ought to be as far, as any other, from any endeavor to give it effect.” Translation: A representative’s duty is to his own “judgment” and “conscience,” not to the momentary foibles of constituents.
More recent American figures have voiced similar convictions. John F. Kennedy ’40, whom Lepore cites as having an interest in polling, had a certain Burkean streak. In his 1956 book “Profiles in Courage,” he profiled eight senators who had ignored their constituents in favor of what they saw as the common good. “The true democracy,” Kennedy wrote, “ puts faith in the people—faith that the people will not simply elect men who will represent their views…but also elect men who will exercise their conscientious judgment.”
What do these philosophical meditations on true democracy and representation have to do with last Tuesday, the future of polling, and the upcoming presidential campaign? Most obviously, the results of Houston’s referendum give some idea of why direct democracy, in practice, is often a poor idea. When minority rights are up for grabs in an election with 26.9 percent turnout, those “hasty opinions” of which Burke was rightly wary are at their most influential. In Mississippi, meanwhile, the strange results of the Democratic primary might make a living JFK question his “faith in the people.” Similarly, the Republican victory in Kentucky, driven by a lack of trust in “career politicians” regardless of their policies, also points to a tendency to value vague labels over “conscientious judgment.”
In a world where populists like Donald Trump and Ben Carson are serious contenders for the Presidency, what Lepore calls the increasingly “Trumpian” nature of our politics is especially disturbing. Electing leaders “who will exercise their conscientious judgment” to protect “the real good of the rest of the community” remains the basic imperative of American democracy. If last Tuesday is any bell-weather, however, reality remains far removed from that aspiration. Just don’t expect the latest poll to tell you that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite increased public attention to the cost of higher education and student debt, college tuition continues to grow with no sign of plateauing. According to a new report by The Chronicle for Higher Education, the inflation-adjusted cost of one year at Harvard College has jumped more than 31 percent since 1998. Last spring, the College announced that yearly tuition would break $60,000 for the first time in its history.
Of course, these tuition hikes have gone hand in hand with increases in financial aid. In 2014, the University spent $170 million on need-based aid, compared to $73 million in 2004, when the University first launched the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. The average family now pays $12,000 annually—less than a fifth of Harvard’s sticker price—and the College has projected that more than half of the Class of 2019 would receive financial aid.
But while recipients of aid continue to pay similar amounts to attend Harvard, higher income families are bearing the burden of the tuition hikes. For example, a family earning $250,000 annually, the benchmark just short of qualifying for need-based aid, has seen tuition eat up a significant and increasing portion of its income.
This trend—demanding more and more for tuition with no ceiling in sight—may be unfair to higher income families, especially those that fall just short of receiving aid. But even more troubling is the possibility that increasing tuition alongside financial aid creates a self-reinforcing cycle furthering growth in both categories. This idea is called the Bennett Hypothesis after President Reagan’s former Secretary of Education William Bennett, who proposed it in a 1987 New York Times op-ed. It suggests that generous aid policies enable universities to raise tuition knowing that the aid will soften the increases.
As costs keep rising, this theory continues to gain support. Speaking at the University of Michigan in 2012, President Obama echoed Secretary Bennett’s argument: “It’s not just enough to increase student aid and you can imagine why. We can’t just keep on subsidizing skyrocketing tuition.”
Despite rising costs, studies continue to point to the long-term value of higher education. Tuition growth is not likely to deter students from attending college altogether any time soon. But if tuition at Harvard and other private institutions continues to increase unabated, at a certain point the cost-benefit analysis of attending will simply not add up, particularly for those near the aid threshold.
Given the large amount of aid that colleges like Harvard receive from the federal government, government policies have a key role to play in slowing tuition growth. President Obama has continued to pursue ideas in this area, as have presidential contenders like Hillary Clinton, but more decisive action on this front is clearly needed.
More locally, Harvard should hold itself accountable for keeping tuition down. This goal is especially crucial as Harvard aims to attract students from more diverse backgrounds. The University, cushioned by its $37 billion endowment, must commit itself to bringing tuition growth under control. With the resources to lead on this issue, we have few excuses for not aggressively pursuing solutions.

Imagine you lived in a community where thousands of members came together to express that they felt unsafe, hurt, and unwelcome. Imagine that most leaders in this community responded with silence. Imagine that the ones who did respond asked these community members to get over it and move on.
In the year 2015, none of us should be satisfied with living in this type of community.
Likewise, none of us should expect students of color at the University of Missouri and Yale to be satisfied with feeling marginalized in their communities, as disturbing and racially insensitive behavior remain seriously unaddressed on their respective campuses.
In the case of Yale, one administrator sent an email that suggested that students of color either look the other way or assume the burden of confronting and educating the very people who make their community unwelcoming. Though exercising her constitutional right to free speech, this administrator critically failed in her duty to help foster spaces where all students can feel safe at the university.
In response to these high-profile incidents in recent days, thousands of students have come together to demand change at Yale and Mizzou, and they have every right to do so. 
This is not unique to Mizzou, Yale, or any of the other campuses that have seen protests this week. These are not responses to isolated incidents that only occurred in the last two weeks. At universities across this nation, students of color have voiced their frustrations with racism, whether committed maliciously or obliviously, that they have experienced on their campuses—only to have those concerns so often met with silence, disbelief, or disregard.
The reason we are even having a national conversation about institutional racism at this very moment is because courageous students at Yale and Mizzou refused to allow their frustrations to once again fall on deaf ears. This time, these students turned up the volume, and now, the whole country is listening.
To be sure, violence of any sort, including the reports of spitting at Yale and pushing at Mizzou, is objectionable. But these demonstrations have overwhelmingly been peaceful, and for that reason, it would be tragically misguided to condemn them as disproportionate.
We must understand that what we have seen in recent days is not simply a response to a single insensitive email, one racially offensive costume, one racially exclusive party, or a random incident of the n-word being said on campus. What we have seen at both Mizzou and Yale is what happens when a group of people are tired of being marginalized from the moment they set foot on campus. It’s what happens when students of color are tired of carrying the burden of having to educate or confront the very people who make them feel unsafe. It’s what happens when students of color can no longer pretend that quiet dialogue will solve the systemic issues that prevent them from being fully included at these institutions.
In his famous “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Martin Luther King, Jr., addressed a group of clergymen who opposed his participation in the nonviolent protests of the early 1960s. King said something that speaks to the skepticism we see today. “You deplore the demonstrations taking place,” he wrote, “but your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations.”
Like the students of color at Mizzou and Yale, King was told to wait. He was told to be calm and to engage those who wielded power with quiet dialogue rather than with forceful and visible nonviolent demonstration. Thankfully, Martin Luther King, Jr., did not listen to that advice.
And thankfully, students of color at Mizzou and Yale, too, refused to remain calm in the face of repeated disregard for their full inclusion. For in their audacity to speak up when others preferred that they keep quiet—in one brave team’s refusal to play football when others preferred that they go on with business as usual, and in one student’s daring week without food—these students collectively made possible this full-fledged, national dialogue on race relations. This powerful reminder of just how important nonviolent resistance is for jump-starting social change should be the beginning of a fundamental shift toward greater inclusion at universities across the land.

UPDATED: November 12, 2015, at 10:16 p.m.
After nine years at the helm of Harvard Medical School, Dean Jeffrey S. Flier will step down from his position at the end of next July, when he will take a sabbatical year and then return to the school as a faculty member.
In an interview Thursday, following the announcement of his upcoming departure, Flier characterized his move to step down as a natural transition, given that he has held the position for what he considers a significant amount of time. Flier said he met with University President Drew G. Faust earlier this month to discuss his plans to resign.
“Anytime you take a job like this, there’s a point at which you decide it’s time to let someone else go forward,” Flier said. “I am going to be completing nine years.”
Throughout his tenure as dean, Flier oversaw the historic overhaul of the Medical School’s curriculum. Rolled out earlier this academic year, the new curriculum—its most significant update since the 1980s—integrates multiple disciplines into single courses and uses the flipped classroom model over traditional lecture formats.
Flier divided his initiatives into three broad categories: education; service, including renaming the social medicine department to the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine; and research, referring to the Department of Biomedical Informatics’ launch earlier this year.
Flier said stepping down at the end of the year would best allow for a smooth transition.
“I wanted to be sure that the initiatives and reforms that we were putting in place were in solid, viable, exciting shape before I decided I would step away from the job, and I concluded over the last couple of months that this was true,” Flier said. “The things that I had been working on that were most taking my energy and are new are now going to do well, whether I’m the dean or not.”
Flier is the latest in a series of deans to depart the helms of their respective schools. At the end of last school year, David T. Ellwood ’75 stepped down from his position as dean of the Kennedy School of Government. At the end of 2014, Cherry A. Murray resigned from her post as dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to direct the U.S. Energy Department’s Office of Science. Julio Frenk, too, left his post as dean of the School of Public Health this year to become president of the University of Miami.
Richard M. Schwartzstein, a Medical School professor who chaired the task force on its curriculum redesign and worked closely with Flier, said Flier will leave a lasting legacy because of his commitment to education.
“He’s been incredibly supportive of the academy and of education in general and has encouraged us to proceed with a very innovative curriculum,” Schwartzstein said. “I’m confident that it will be a transformative curriculum and it will be a part of what he’s remembered for.”
Flier’s resignation comes as the Medical School seeks to raise $750 million in a capital campaign, efforts that deans typically lead, courting donors and alumni around the country. The campaign publicly launched last November, and the school has raised $467 million toward the goal.
“The campaign, especially in terms of education, is really critical,” Schwartzstein said. “We have to create new learning spaces that will facilitate this new curriculum and the teaching styles we’re using, and [Flier] was very aggressive in making those kinds of changes.”
According to Flier, the capital campaign is “on target,” and he said his commitment to the school will last beyond his deanship.
“I’m not abandoning the school or going away,” Flier said. “I’m going to be on the faculty, and I’m happy to keep alive the relationships that I’ve built to support this school.”
In a statement, Faust said she would work with Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 to select a successor. Flier will not serve on the search committee, he said.
“From the moment he accepted my invitation to serve as dean, Jeff has invested himself relentlessly in sustaining Harvard Medical School’s excellence and enhancing its extraordinary contributions to improving health,” Faust said in a statement.

A plurality of sophomores have declared concentrations in Economics, according to preliminary data from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s office.
Following the rollout of an online student information system designed to streamline the process for submitting study cards and add/drop course forms, among other academic forms, this semester sophomores for the first time declared their concentrations electronically.
“Before, a lot of students waited, and we wouldn’t know right up until the deadline today,” said Maggie Welsh, the associate registrar for enrollment services. She wrote in an email that, as of Thursday afternoon at 4 p.m., out of  “the 1,667 sophomores expected to submit declarations, 1,389 have done so.”
213 of those submissions are declarations in Economics, Welsh wrote.
In addition, out of the 1,389 students who have declared, 1,257 are pursuing Bachelor of Arts degrees, 49 are pursuing Bachelor of Sciences, and 83 are pursuing joint concentrations, she added
Sophomores first met with advisers, filled out plans of study—indicating the courses they will take in their remaining time at the College—and imported those plans into the declaration form on the new my.harvard website. Both sophomore advisers and advisers from the College’s 49 concentrations had to approve the form online for students to be declared officially by the Nov. 12 deadline.
Filling out their forms online, many sophomores this year submitted their declaration forms earlier than in previous years when students used paper forms and had to obtain signatures from several advisers, Welsh said.
In an interview, Welsh said the traffic in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s office on Thursday was much slower than during past fall semesters, when students had to drop off paper forms for academic transactions.
“I haven’t heard a lot from students that they were experiencing technical difficulties. They have seemed to figure it out,” Welsh said. “The numbers show that it is working.”
The new electronic tool component of sophomores’ concentration declaration, however, is not the most important part of the process, she said.
“I hope that students and concentration advisers know that the purpose of a tool like this is to make the bureaucracy part of it easier,” Welsh said. “Because...while it’s satisfying to hit submit and see that concentration on your record, what it’s really about is the conversation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Under a rainy evening sky on Veterans Day, former service members, ROTC members, and civilians ran the steps of Harvard Stadium to raise money for a veterans’ education program. 
Event organizer Daniel G. West, a former Marine captain and current student at the Law School and Business School, said that this is the second year of the Harvard Veterans Day stadium run, an event in which participants run up and down the steps of the stadium to fundraise for the Warrior Scholar Project.
The Warrior Scholar Project, which began at Yale, organizes a weeklong “academic boot camp” for veterans entering college. Last year, professors from Harvard, including University President Drew G. Faust, taught classes and seminars to veterans in academic reading and writing, among other topics.
A diverse group of participatns showed up to run the stadium steps Wednesday.
“It’s a mix, which is really great,” West said. “They’re just all out here to be supportive.”
One participant, Aaron I. Henricks ’16, echoed West, saying he wanted to contribute to veterans’ causes.
“I saw the event, and the money goes to an awesome cause, so I wanted to support that and spend Veterans Day in a meaningful way,” said Henricks, whose father and grandfather served in the U.S. Navy.
Despite the inclement weather, West said the turnout was relatively impressive, with about 20 people participating in the run.
“We have a bigger crowd this year. This is only the second year of the run but we are hoping to make it a tradition,” he said.
Henricks added that he also received personal benefit from the fundraising event.
“I can get some cardio in, which would never normally happen, so that’s also an added benefit," he said.

While non-tenure-track faculty members at universities are perceived as having less expertise, they are often more involved in the university community than their tenure-track counterparts, according to a recent study of two unnamed universities.
Researchers said the difference between non-tenure-track faculty and tenure-track faculty derives not from specific social interactions, but instead from the norm in the field of academia that research, not teaching, qualifies one as an expert.
“We have such a research focused mentality, perhaps for good reason, but also to the detriment of seeing teachers as experts, especially in research focused institutions,” said Nathan F. Alleman, a co-author of the study and a professor at Baylor University.
As of last May, Harvard employed 295 full-time non-tenure-track faculty members within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in comparison to 726 tenure-track faculty. While many non-tenure-track faculty members at Harvard begin their positions with the intention of using their experience as a professional stepping stone, some say they are prevented from pursuing their own independent research, either by University policies or lack of funding.
Alleman and his co-authors, Don Haviland, a professor at CSU Long Beach, and Cara C. Allen, a professor at Baylor University, interviewed 39 full-time non-tenure-track members from two universities, choosing participants with at least three years of experience in their schools to ensure they were “embedded in the department.”
The study found that non-tenure-track faculty members are often more involved with the community than their tenure-track counterparts.
“We felt that in both institutions, in many ways, they became the face of the department,” Alleman said.
This involvement ranged from leading summer outreach programs to managing advising programs for undergraduate students within the universities. The researchers also found while tenure-track faculty focus mostly on interactions with graduate students, non-tenure track are often more engaged with undergraduates.
Many non-tenure-track faculty cited the relationships they build with undergraduates as reasons they stayed in their positions, despite the sometimes unequal working environments, Alleman said.
“[Non-tenure track] felt loyal to the students, and even if they were having an awful time with their colleagues, they were motivated to work with them, ” Alleman said.
Researchers also found that non-tenure track faculty members often assume a variety of roles within their respective universities, ranging from full-time lecturers to part-time teaching assistants. Because of the “hybrid” nature of their jobs, there does not exist a concrete label for non-tenure-track faculty.
“We don’t quite know how to talk about non-tenure-track faculty, and even the term is defining them by what they aren’t, rather than what they are,” Alleman said .
Alleman said that he does not believe the solution is urging professors to seek the tenure track, because sometimes that is not always their ultimate objective. Instead, he called for a cultural shift in the profession.

Harvard affiliates and local community members gathered for a panel discussion commemorating the reissue of The Rarest of the Rare: Stories Behind the Treasures at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, a book showcasing some of the most unique objects within the museum’s diverse collection. 
During the panel in the Geological Lecture Hall on Thursday evening, speakers highlighted additional scientifically and historically significant items in the museum’s possession.
The first speaker was Nancy Pick, author of Rarest of the Rare, who spoke about a few of the items highlighted in the book.
“The team working on the book had decided that it should showcase 60 specimens of animals, plants, and minerals from Harvard’s vast collections,” said Pick. “Some specimens had historic significance. Some had scientific importance and some just had a good story to tell.”
Pick also discussed some of the museum’s current projects, such as explorations in the field of de-extinction and the digitization of Harvard collections
Raquel Alonso-Perez, curator of the Harvard Mineralogical & Geological Museum, focused on two objects—the Hamlin necklace, a historically significant piece of jewelry, and a rare gold spire—during her portion of the discussion.
Panelist Donald H. Pfister, a professor of systematic botany and former interim dean of the College, stressed the importance and value of exploring the Harvard collections in order to find unexpected objects.
“Our collections are full of these materials that we haven’t documented, [that] we don’t understand particularly, that we need to look at and examine,” he said. “So in the end our collections are full of rare and interesting objects both discovered and probably just as many undiscovered.”
James Hanken, a professor of Biology and director of the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, showed a digital representation of an earthworm’s anatomy and said that such innovative uses of technology could serve to enrich knowledge found within the collections.
Jonathan E. Chester, a student at William James College who attended the event, said that the discussion served to promote an interest in the narrative behind certain scientific objects as much as the objects themselves.
“I’m not so much focusing on particular items in the collection or particular specimens as much as being curious on some of the backstory,” he said, adding that he was interested in “some of the human stories behind them.”

Nicholas Mirzoeff, professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, discussed the Black Lives Matter movement, the events at the University of Missouri, and their relation to past social movements in a discussion attended by more than 100 people at the Harvard Art Museums on Thursday. 
Mirzoeff spoke about how an increase in internet access and higher populations in urban areas have changed the outlook and methods of modern social movements.
Jessica L. Martinez, director of the museum’s Division of Academic and Public Programs, introduced Mirzoeff, explaining the historical context of social action preceding the Black Lives Matter movement.
“It is important to consider some of this imagery, much of it created over 50 years ago, in the context of the present situation,” Martinez said.
Mirzoeff focused his presentation around the idea of the “visual commons,” which he defined to be conceptual spaces “where we practice freedom, see each other, invent each other, and create a common space between us that cannot be owned.”
He also said citizens have a responsibility to use the visual commons to protest injustice in innovative ways in order to combat the short attention span of the media. Mirzoeff discussed the implications of Black Lives Matter and the visual commons on the current events taking place at the University of Missouri.
“It used to be said that if you wanted to enact a revolution, you needed to win over a segment of the armed forces; now we can say you need to win over a segment of professional athletes,” he said. “It was the combination of Missouri’s football team saying they were not going to play and the individual who went on a hunger strike which caused panic, and led to the resignation of the president.”
Mirzoeff compared the art and photography of African-American social action from the 1860s, American reconstruction, and the civil rights movement, eventually transitioning to modern times with the Black Lives Matter movement.
“The Black Lives Matter protesting of today does not address the corporate media, and that is a real change from the civil rights movement,” Mirzoeff said. “Now, we address social media.”
Samantha DeAndrade, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health who attended the event, said she was surprised by the role of social media in the Black Lives Matter movement.
“It starts on the ground at the crime scene, and then it spreads to college campuses, and now we’re in a museum talking about it,” DeAndrade said. “It reinforces the importance of social media and the great role it has played in getting these conversations started.”

Five members of the Class of 2018 declared the College’s newest concentration, Theater, Dance, and Media, as their primary academic focus by Thursday night’s deadline to submit plans of study, according to Deborah D. Foster, the program’s director of undergraduate studies.
As the department’s inaugural class, the five sophomores will help determine the future of the program and offer feedback on its structure and ability to offer a fulfilling academic experience to students interested in the performing arts, according to both faculty and newly declared concentrators. 

The committee will also welcome three sophomore joint concentrators, though a malfunction in the my.harvard student information system prevented students from declaring joint concentrations in Theater, Dance, and Media until late on Thursday evening, according to Foster. Two juniors were already declared concentrators after changing their plans of study earlier this year.
First announced last October, Theater, Dance, and Media rolled out with fanfare over the course of this semester after years of planning. It ultimately came to fruition when University President Drew G. Faust granted the program $5 million in seed funding from her discretionary budget.
Foster said members of the Theater, Dance, and Media standing committee are satisfied with their share of the 1,389 sophomores who had declared concentrations by Thursday night.
“It’s about what we anticipated, and we’re delighted with the number,” she said.
And many of the students now entering the program said they see its small size as an asset.
“Since there are so few concentrators and such a tight-knit faculty, we basically get one-on-one attention from everyone in the department,” said Sam A. Hagen ’18, a newly declared joint concentrator in Theater, Dance, and Media and the History of Art and Architecture.
Sarah K. Grammar ’18, who also declared a concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media, said she feels the small community of concentrators will be one of the most rewarding aspects of the new program. They will take a departmental sophomore tutorial together next semester.
“We have a really wide range of people in all different performing arts forms, and I know a lot of them personally,” she said. “Having these wonderfully talented, wonderfully focused students who are my age, who are just as passionate about theater as I am but in different ways, is always fun because then we can learn from each other.”
Most of the declared concentrators are currently involved in the performing arts on campus, and Grammar and Hagen said they intend to pursue careers in theater after graduation.
“I know what I do after Harvard will be somehow related to theater, but I’m still trying to find my niche within theater,” Hagen said. “If I’m leaning toward anything, it’s the academic study of theater, so pursuing performance studies or theater studies and maybe going into academia, which is why a theater concentration is so exciting, as opposed to a performing arts program somewhere else.”
Foster suggested that this year’s sophomore class will help shape the concentration.
“We think that the students who are coming in as concentrators...will play a real role in the concentration, in developing it and working out where it will go, and then determining what works and what doesn’t,” she said.
Grammar said she feels a sense of responsibility as one of the first Theater, Dance, and Media concentrators.
“I feel like this inaugural class...is really going to define what it is, and I want to make sure that the work we do really sets it apart and makes it something unique for students to study here at Harvard,” she said. “I feel like there’s a lot that rests on this first year, and I just want to make sure that we do it justice for the students that come after us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 13, 2015, at 5:15 p.m.
A group of Harvard Law School professors have started a publicity campaign to challenge the depiction of the school’s sexual assault grievance process in "The Hunting Ground," a documentary film about campus sexual assault that CNN is scheduled to air on Nov. 19.
Released in the spring, the film features Kamilah Willingham, a Law School alumna, telling the story of what she describes as her and a friend’s experience being sexually assaulted by another Law student during her time at the school. While he is not identified by name in the film, a press release names Brandon Winston as the alleged perpetrator. 
In between shots of Harvard’s campus—including the Harvard Lampoon and Matthews Hall—Willingham recalls how the Law School initially found Winston guilty and dismissed him, but professors reinstated him after an appeal.
The film is critical of the Law School’s reversal of the decision. Willingham’s narrative comes at the beginning of the film, which focuses heavily on the testimony of victims of sexual assault and what they describe as the lackluster administrative responses at colleges and universities across the country.
The government found the Law School in violation of gender equity law Title IX last December, which the film cites as evidence of the school’s negligence in the Willingham case.
Nineteen Law School professors are now challenging the presentation of Willingham’s narrative in the film, calling it “an unfair and misleading portrayal of the facts in [Winston’s] case.” A press release from Winston’s legal team makes similar arguments. Both argue that three separate adjudicatory bodies—a panel of Law School faculty, a grand jury, and a jury in a criminal trial—exonerated Winston of the most serious claims against him.
“Neither the film nor the press package informs the viewer about the damning evidence that caused the jury to reject Ms. Willingham’s claim that Mr. Winston raped her friend, and that caused the grand jury to refuse to indict Mr. Winston on any charges relating to Ms. Willingham herself,” the press release from Winston’s lawyers says.
Willingham could not be reached for comment. In a statement, the filmmakers rejected the claims of inaccuracy in the movie.
“Everything in The Hunting Ground is accurate and supported by documentation,” director Kirby Dick and producer Amy Ziering said in a statement.
The film does include a slide card at the end describing Winston’s criminal process outside of the Law School, noting that “a grand jury indicted the accused with felony sexual assault of Kamilah’s friend and a jury convicted him of misdemeanor non-sexual assault. He was never tried for assaulting Kamiliah.”
Many of the professors challenging the documentary’s portrayal of Harvard are vocal critics of the University’s own approach to handling sexual harassment and the government’s interpretation of Title IX. Last October, 28 professors—17 of whom signed the letter about “The Hunting Ground”—blasted Harvard’s central sexual assault policy in an open letter in the Boston Globe, calling it biased against the accused.
Janet E. Halley, one of the Law School professors challenging “The Hunting Ground” and a signatory of the 2014 Globe letter, said the group will launch a website and upload documents about Winston’s case to further challenge the documentary. Halley argued that the decision to name Winston constituted “an attack” and that she and the other professors felt compelled to come to his defense.
Concerns about the documentary’s portrayal of Harvard’s disciplinary process have previously been raised. In March, The Crimson published a story challenging statistics that the film cites to describe the incidence of sexual assault at Harvard and the administration’s response. In particular, the film conflated Harvard University and Harvard College and misrepresented the sanctions handed down in some cases. Since the film first came out, those statistics have been updated, reflecting the points raised by The Crimson.
The filmmakers confirmed that edits have been made to the film since its initial release. “Like many films that screen at Sundance, the film was not finished as of January. Several minor changes were made to the film as part of the normal editing process,” Dick and Ziering said in a statement.
Robb London, a spokesperson for the Law School, wrote in an email that the school does not publicly discuss student discipline.
“The Law School administration refrains from publicly discussing particular disciplinary cases. We are deeply committed to addressing the problem of sexual assault and to ensuring that our procedures for addressing such incidents are fair to all who are involved,” London wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a year after topping Yale with the fanfare of ESPN’s GameDay in the background to secure the Ivy League title and post its third undefeated season in a century, the Harvard football team is poised to make history. Again.
Should the Crimson win Saturday, not only will it be one game away from back-to-back perfect records for the first time in school history, but it will be the first Harvard team to clinch three consecutive Ancient Eight championships.
To solidify its place in the history books, however, the 2015 squad will need to go through a Penn team that, even when struggling, has managed to make this week nine contest a dogfight.
On Franklin Field last year, the Quakers entered the penultimate contest of the season with just a single win and as heavy underdogs to the undefeated Crimson. But three quarters in, Harvard trailed by seven to a scrappy Penn team, playing for pride in coach Al Bagnoli’s final home game.
Were it not for a career-high rushing day from then-junior running back Paul Stanton and a 17-point fourth quarter performance by Harvard, the Quakers might have pulled off the biggest upset of the 2014 Ivy League season.
Now coached by Ray Priore, Bagnoli’s defensive coordinator, Penn (5-3, 4-1 Ivy) will enter its matchup with Harvard (8-0, 5-0) as underdogs once more. However, given the way the Quakers have looked in the latter half of the season, an upset Saturday in Harvard Stadium is a very real possibility.
“The best way I can put it is, [Penn is the] most improved team in the league,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “They’re probably playing the best football of any team in the league, including Harvard, at this stage.”
Spurred by the confidence of winning four straight league games, including last week’s overtime victory over Princeton, the Quakers will be playing as much for a share of the conference championship as for vengeance for 2014’s fourth-quarter meltdown. Harvard currently sits alone atop the league, but a loss to Penn would almost certainly mean a shared title.
The Crimson is coming off a close victory of its own, a gritty contest against Bagnoli’s new team in New York that saw Columbia score 13 unanswered points in the final quarter. The visitors managed to hang on to a 24-16 advantage as time expired, but the Lions’ late no-huddle scoring drives exposed flaws in Harvard’s veteran defense.
“We have the potential to be a great defense every time we step on that field, and we need to make sure that everyone has that attitude when we take the field,” captain Matt Koran said. “I think that might have been lacking a little bit in the fourth quarter against Columbia…. They caught us off guard, so we need to be prepared for everything that will come at us and play lights-out defense.”
Koran and company will have their hands full with dual-threat Penn quarterback Alek Torgersen, who has averaged 250 yards through the air and nearly 60 yards on the ground through the past four games.
The Quakers’ offense is designed to utilize Torgersen as a rusher as well as a passer, which may present a challenge Saturday. The Crimson has struggled at slowing mobile quarterbacks in the past few weeks, allowing Columbia quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg and Dartmouth play-caller Dalyn Williams to scramble for first downs when Harvard dropped back seven or eight defenders into pass coverage.
“You’re not tackling a 5’10” 210-pound guy,” Murphy said. “[Torgersen’s] a 6’3”, 230-pound dual-threat quarterback, so you have to account for him on every play.
For Harvard’s offense, returning to a balanced attack will be key to extending the win streak to 23. Senior quarterback Scott Hosch averaged 300 passing yards in the last two contests, but the improved pass attack has come at the expense of the ground game. Harvard failed to break the 100-yard rushing mark against Dartmouth and Columbia after averaging over 200 rushing yards per game through the first six weeks.
This imbalance comes partially from an injury-riddled offensive line, which will play for the second-straight week without three-year starting lineman Anthony Fabiano, who suffered a broken toe against the Big Green, and partially from the strength of opposing defensive lines.
Resurrecting a productive run game may prove difficult against Penn, who bring another talent-studded front seven anchored by linebacker Tyler Drake, who leads the league in sacks and ranks third in tackles.
But even with the momentum Penn carries into Harvard Stadium on Saturday, the visitors will need to play a nearly flawless game to hand the Crimson its first loss since 2013.
“Our offense is fully capable of putting up 40 points every single game, they’re going to go out there and get the job done this week, and our defense, I’ve never been more confident in a group of guys than I am now,” Koran said. “We’re very confident all the way across the board.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The road back to the NCAA Tournament begins in Cambridge this weekend as the Harvard men’s basketball team kicks off its season against MIT and Providence. While the Crimson got its first taste of game action last weekend in an exhibition against McGill, the team will tip off the official season Friday night against the Engineers under the banners of its five consecutive Ivy Title banners in Lavietes Pavilion.
While Harvard holds a 13-game win streak against the Engineers, this is a very different Crimson team. The cross-town rivals faced off in last year’s season opener, with Harvard defeating MIT, 73-52, but the Crimson’s top two offensive weapons–Wesley Saunders ’15 and senior Siyani Chambers–shouldered the majority of the scoring burden, tallying 15 points each in the opener. Without Saunders and Chambers, Harvard must find new ways to generate offense.
Junior Zena Edosomwan contributed 21 points in the McGill exhibition, but has been inconsistent in the regular season. In his first two years with the Crimson, the junior has averaged just 3.5 points and four rebounds per game.
The Crimson is in a very different place than when it last faced the Engineers. At this time last year, Harvard was ranked No. 25 in the nation, today it is ranked No. 4 in the Ivy League preseason poll. MIT may be a Division III basketball program, but Harvard cannot take its opponent lightly.
“They’re a team that always does well in their division and always kind of has a culture of excellence there, a culture of winning, and a culture of championships, so they certainly know how to win,” co-captain Evan Cummins said.
Less than 24 hours after tipping off against the Engineers, the Crimson will head to the Dunkin Donuts Center to take on Providence. The Friars present a stark difference in competition, as they were a No. 6 seed in the 2015 NCAA Tournament.
The biggest question of the weekend lies in how Harvard will contain Providence junior guard Kris Dunn. Dunn, who was expected to enter the NBA draft last year but elected to remain at Providence for another year, was ranked the No. 2 college basketball player in the nation by ESPN and averaged just under 16 points and eight assists per game last year.
Dunn’s size and ability to run the offense at the point will pose trouble for the Crimson. Harvard’s point guards remain untested, as the team lost presumptive starter Chambers, its three-year starting point guard, to an ACL injury over the summer.
“He’s someone that he’s so good it’s not going to be one person that’s going to be able to guard him and contain him,” Cummins said. “We’re really going to have to always know where he is on the floor and really focus on our help side rotations to be able to help whoever’s guarding him. He’s just an explosive and elite level player.”
Against McGill, the Crimson struggled with help defense. Throughout the first half, the visitors exploited the Harvard frontcourt by drawing the forwards out to the perimeter to help cover the speedy McGill guards, leaving a post player wide open for the layup.
“I think they did a good job of taking us away from the rim as far as the bigs go,” Cummins said after the McGill exhibition. “That was a little bit of an adjustment for us because we spent a lot of time on the perimeter and that made it easier for them when their guards penetrated.”
MIT and Providence will give the rookies their first taste at playing back-to-back nights, something the team’s veterans are all too familiar with. The Ivy League structures its conference schedule in a “14-game tournament” where the Ancient Eight teams play back-to-back Friday and Saturday nights for six weeks to round out the regular season.
“We’ve thought about how this could be a great lesson for us as we move into conference play later in our year,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “This is what the league is all about– back to back.”
But the Crimson will inevitably have kinks to work out. Providence will be an important test, giving the young squad a chance to see how it stands up to national competition.
“This is a very new group, all of us are, we’re all in new positions. Basically we are unproven,” Edosomwan said after the McGill exhibition. “We’re all coming together and learning each other on the fly and just trying to be successful. Every day is just a new day we’re trying to get better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What if I told you that the best things come to those who wait? That when you can’t improve on perfection, you must strive to replicate it? That sometimes, how you start means as much as how you finish?
Sorry, paper writing has me daydreaming. I’ll snap out of ESPN 30 for 30 mode now. (PSA: if anyone out there liked that and isn’t on the Crimson sports board, we’d love to have you. We’ll even waive the comp process. Maybe.)
The truth is, though, Harvard football is on the verge of something special. Maybe not documentary-level special, but impressive indeed. A win on Saturday will give the Crimson its third consecutive Ivy League title. Follow that up with a victory over Yale a week later, and Harvard will notch its second consecutive perfect season. That hasn’t happened in Cambridge since before World War I.
As you may recall, dear reader, at this point I am wont to throw in a movie reference or two to spice up my narrative. The problem is, movies need drama. The best ones feature suspense and uncertainty throughout.
To be sure, Harvard fans have watched two close games this season: a last-minute victory over Dartmouth and a tighter-than-expected tilt with Columbia last week. But for the most part, the Crimson has been so dominant that this year that its movie script would be rejected on account of being too dull and predictable. Take away Dartmouth, and Harvard has trailed for 17 seconds in seven games. The Crimson is like the Beatles in their prime. It keeps churning out hits, apparently unable to be stopped.
Saturday afternoon is Senior Day at Harvard Stadium. If wins and losses are any measure, the more playing time this year’s senior class gets, the better Harvard football becomes. In 2012, a two-loss record put the team one win away from an Ivy co-championship. The class’s first Ancient Eight title came one year later, with a lone defeat coming in triple-overtime. Its junior season, the Crimson went undefeated and outlasted Yale to capture the championship. Two more W’s this year, and these seniors will pull off the same feat.
If there’s nothing to improve on, why not do the same thing again? Just 120 minutes of play stand between Harvard football and doing just that.
On to the picks.
DARTMOUTH AT BROWN
The Brown Daily Herald blog recently featured a post entitled “Memorable Uber Experiences.” I have to say, there’s some good material there. But if you’re seeking a memorable football game, look elsewhere. After rattling off four wins, the Bears have dropped their last two contests by significant margins. One-loss Dartmouth, meanwhile, needs a victory here to keep its hopes for an Ivy League title alive. Expect Big Green senior leaders quarterback Dalyn Williams and linebacker Will McNamara to keep the green-and-white focused in the final road game of their careers.
Prediction: Dartmouth 31, Brown 10
COLUMBIA AT CORNELL
What a treat we have for you. Last year, FiveThirtyEight labeled this matchup the “worst college football game in the worst college football town.” The good news: Columbia has made noticeable strides since last year. In addition to winning two games, the Lions only lost by eight points to Harvard last week. Moral victories be damned, that’s still an impressive showing, given the Crimson outscored Columbia, 148-0, from 2012 to 2014.
The bad news (or funny news, depending on your perspective) is that Cornell may actually be worse than last year. The Big Red offense and defense rank last and second-to-last, respectively, in the Ancient Eight. Half of Cornell’s fans may attend games to see the team’s punter, who is the best in the conference. Maybe it’s because he gets a lot of practice.
Prediction: Columbia 24, Cornell 14
YALE AT PRINCETON
Both the Bulldogs and Tigers enter with 2-3 conference records and have been eliminated from title contention. In seasons past, this penultimate contest typically carries more weight. Nevertheless, more important showdowns loom in week 10 for both squads. Princeton will have a chance to prove itself against Dartmouth, one of the league’s best and a program the Tigers haven’t defeated since 2009. For Yale, week 10 means The Game. The significance of that one I don’t need to explain
Prediction: Yale 35, Princeton 24
PENN AT HARVARD
For the second straight season, the showdown with Penn represents a championship game for Harvard. Win on Saturday, and the worst the Crimson can do in 2015 is a co-championship. As this year’s senior class knows as well as any, though, the Quakers have a good deal of fight in them. In 2012, Penn outlasted Harvard in a dogfight. The next year, Penn scored 30 points in the second half but ultimately fell, 38-30. Last season was yet another battle, with the undefeated Crimson finding itself trailing in the fourth quarter before pulling out a 10-point win.
This year will likely be more of the same. Penn has won four straight, making it one of the hottest teams in the Ivy League. The problem is, its opponent is the hottest Ivy team. Harvard will enter this game hungry and ride a balanced performance to victory, but it may be a tighter contest than many expect.
Prediction: Harvard 28, Penn 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether they’re kicking off a season, in the midst of one, or drawing it to a close, several Harvard teams are playing key matchups that you’ll want to keep an eye on this weekend.
Women’s Volleyball at Yale (Friday 7 p.m.), at Brown (Saturday 7 p.m.)
The Harvard women’s volleyball team, currently possessing sole first in the conference standings, is set to conclude its season this weekend with nothing less than the Ivy League title at stake.
The Crimson (13-9, 9-3 Ivy) very much controls its own destiny—a weekend sweep would clinch a second straight Ivy championship. However, a myriad of possibilities, including potential two-through-four team playoffs, await if the weekend games play out differently.
Yale (12-9, 7-5) sits two games back in the division and would need some help from Harvard, as well as the other two teams mathematically still in the hunt, Dartmouth and Princeton, in order to have a shot at winning the title.
Brown (10-14, 4-8) is currently second-to-last in the conference standings and has lost four in a row.
Although the Crimson won’t play them this weekend, the Tigers (13-8, 8-4) have won five in a row and are hard-charging towards the front. Princeton now sits a game behind Harvard as the teams get set to play their last two scheduled regular-season games.
Men’s Ice Hockey at Quinnipiac (Friday 7 p.m.)
The No. 6/7 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (3-0-1, 3-0-1 ECAC) takes on its highest ranked opponent thus far this season, No. 3/4 Quinnipiac, on Friday in a meeting of two high-powered offenses.
The undefeated Bobcats (8-0-0, 2-0-0), last year’s regular season ECAC champions, received five first-place votes in the latest USA TODAY/USA Hockey magazine rankings, and match up against a conference rival Crimson team that has outscored its first four opponents by a combined margin of 19-6.
Quinnipiac is also having a dominant season, however, posting a goal differential of +21 over eight games.
Friday’s game is the first of two meetings between the two teams this season. Last year, Harvard took the season series 2-1 over Quinnipiac.
Men’s Basketball vs MIT (Friday 7:45 p.m.), at Providence (Saturday 7 p.m.)
The Harvard men’s basketball team returns from a fourth straight NCAA Tournament trip to tip off its 2015-16 campaign with a home opener against MIT on Friday, then will head to Providence on Saturday to play the Friars.
The Crimson took 2009 NCAA champion and perennial heavyweights North Carolina down to the wire in last year’s first-round tournament game, rallying and leading the Tar Heels late before losing 67-65.
Providence is also coming off of an NCAA tournament appearance. It did not find success, though, likewise being ousted in the first round.
Harvard and MIT played last year, with the Crimson winning, 73-52.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rarely does a team lose 40 percent of its roster. Rarely does a team have to bring in eight athletes on a 17-player roster. Even more rarely does a team replace half of its coaching staff. For the Harvard women’s basketball team, the offseason was—to say the least—eventful.
With four seniors graduating and two underclassmen leaving the team, the Crimson was left with a decimated roster at the end of last season. Following the departure of two of Harvard’s most prolific scorers in Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Erin McDonnell ’15, head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith took in one of the largest recruiting classes in her 33 years as head coach. This year’s class includes seven freshmen and one sophomore transfer from Stanford.
Despite the changes, co-captain AnnMarie Healy is excited about the new team and staff.
“At the beginning of the year it was really important that those seven freshman felt welcome and felt a part of this team,” Healy said. “Sometimes it is challenging to introduce new freshmen to a team, but I think this group has melted in really well. I have just been really impressed with all of them and how they each work so hard everyday.”
This weekend, the Harvard will take on Maine at home to open up the season. In stark contrast to the Crimson, the Black Bears are returning nearly all the players featured on the 2014-15 squad. Last year, Maine went 23-9 with a six game winning streak that included a 65-46 win against Harvard.
“Maine has their entire team back,” Delaney-Smith said. “They had a good year last year. It’s the experienced team versus the inexperienced team. That’s sort of the classic matchup we’re going to have.”
The Black Bears, in stark contrast to the Crimson, boast eight seniors and only two freshmen, having only graduated one player last season. Maine is returning all of their starters, which includes their two leading scorers, junior guard Sigi Koizar and senior forward Liz Wood. In comparison, three of Harvard’s top four scorers graduated.
“It’ll be interesting to see how it all unfolds in games,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had two scrimmages, one we didn’t do so well in and the other we did very well in. I’ll be interested to see how consistent we can stay.”
In addition to so many new players, the 2015-16 Crimson squad has two new coaches in their first game with Harvard, Mike Roux and Jasmine Sborov. Before coming to Cambridge, Roux was an associate head coach at the University of New Hampshire, as well as an assistant coach at Holy Cross, Southern New Hampshire, Assumption, and Nichols. Sborov is a 2015 graduate of Colorado, lettering in all four years with the Buffalo.
Also joining the squad as director of basketball operations is Heidi Banks. Following four seasons as an assistant at Amherst, Banks brings a background in guard development, a position Harvard has struggled to find consistency in. Of Harvard’s seven freshman, five play at the traditional guard positions.
“It was time for me to tweak the system,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was a great time to just sort of brain storm and create what was best for the talent we had coming in and returning.”
The Crimson come into the weekend hoping to avenge a 2014 loss to the Black Bears, as well as rebound from a season in which they finished 14-14 and tied for third in the Ivy League with a 7-7 conference record.
“We feel that our team has prepared for this season, not just this week,” Healy said. “[We] have put in a great preseason and worked really hard over the summer. We are excited to see where our preparation takes us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard senior running back Paul Stanton Jr. has played in 35 games over the course of his college career, and at each one of them, Paul Stanton Sr. has been watching from the stands.
For each weekend, Stanton Sr. leaves from Kenner, La. on Thursday or Friday and returns on Sunday or Monday, depending if the game is home or away. In between he has the privilege of watching one of the most prolific rushers in Harvard history add to his career totals.
“He was always my coach growing up,” Stanton Jr. said. “I’d get upset about it sometimes, but that’s really why I think I did so well playing sports when growing up. He was always there to motivate me."
That motivation has paid dividends, as Stanton ranks second in Crimson history with 38 career touchdowns and fourth with 2,832 rushing yards. He has held the starter’s role since sophomore year and missed only one game in the past three years despite a long list of nicks and injuries.
Rushing records, a reputation for durability, and even a Harvard uniform would have appeared foreign six or so years ago, when Stanton was a Louisiana prospect with a far-off dream of attending LSU or Tulane.
Sandwiched between two sisters with athletic accomplishments of their own, Stanton grew up playing pretty much any sport he encountered—soccer, basketball, baseball, and yes, football. That all-athletic equilibrium remained constant until sophomore year, when Stanton had to make a choice between football and basketball.
Despite his father’s personal love of basketball, the decision came easily.
“I was kind of skinny and underweight,” Stanton said. “And I just loved football a lot more.”
But that no-brainer commitment engendered more difficult decisions down the wire. In particular, Stanton had to choose a college.
Despite eye-popping speed, Stanton said that he hardly considered Ivy League football as a possibility; it wasn’t until a pair of Ancient Eight coaches showed up to a spring ball game that Stanton began to take the possibility seriously.
The running back only came to Harvard’s attention by chance, when Stanton was attending a recruiting camp at Brown and heard a tip from senior David Trompke—then a fellow prospect, now a track runner for the Crimson—that Harvard was holding its own camp about an hour away.
Although Stanton was tired and sore, his father urged him to attend, and the pair showed up up without an invitation. That anonymity did not last long, especially after Stanton ran a 4.4 in the 40-yard dash.
“[My dad] saw what a great opportunity it was,” Stanton said. “Without him, I honestly don’t know if I’d be here.”
Soon enough, Harvard coaches took notice, letters began to arrive in the mail, and Stanton arrived on campus, ready to battle for a second-string position. From these early days onward, entrenched senior starter Treavor Scales proved to be a formative influence.
“He really showed me what a Harvard football player was and what it was like to be a leader on the team,” Stanton said. “I owe a lot to him.”
Stanton won the back-up spot, and showed flashes of potential when he played, putting up 456 all-purpose yards as a freshman. A year later, with Scales graduated, Stanton then took over as the starter.
In addition to meeting Scales, freshman Stanton also ran into senior defensive back Jordan Becerra. The fellow rookies forged a quick connection; to this day, they live right next to each other as blockmates.
“He’s hilarious,” Becerra said. “Just look at him—he’s comical.”
The bond between these two, and between Stanton and other members of the football team, is evident pretty quickly. Off the field, Becerra recounted how he, Stanton, and captain Matt Koran often hang together, watching movies in each other’s rooms or just relaxing.
During football games—well that’s a different story.
“He’s one of the most dedicated people I’ve ever met,” Becerra said. “When he’s on the field, he’s just intense all the time. When he gets off, he’s so exhausted because he’s putting everything in.”
The exhaustion makes sense. For someone who frequently disappears beneath larger offensive players during the huddle, Stanton has a perplexingly physical style of running. He hits linebackers with apparent impunity; he specializes in lunging for the extra yard after contact.
“He battles through all the beatings he takes,” said senior offensive lineman Adam Redmond. “That charges us up as a group…. We want to protect him, keep him safe, and let him have success.”
Success he has had, running for a career average of 6.0 yards per carry. This season he has eclipsed 100 yards in exactly half of his games.
Certainly some of these statistics reflect the unusual dominance of Harvard’s offensive line, which started the season with three experienced senior starters. But external factors have only so much explaining power.
“He’s unbelievable, the stuff he does,” Redmond said. “No matter who you throw at him—linebackers or defensive linemen—he runs through them…. He needs a second, and he’s gone.”
