After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A cute blonde falls for a hot British guy at a farmer’s market, then fate crosses their paths again and they hit it off right away. That totally impractical fantasy romance is just what one would expect from one of the CW’s many romcoms. However, “No Tomorrow” adds some novelty to this cliché plot when Xavier, aka “hot British guy” (Joshua Sasse), turns out to be a conspiracy theorist who believes the world is ending in eight months and 12 days. Alarms literally go off when Evie (Tori Anderson), our “cute blonde,” finds out Xavier’s wacky little secret. The pilot of “No Tomorrow” hovers in the gray area between a flop and a success. While the first episode lacks some critical elements, such as good characterization, its twists of novelty show potential.
The show’s strange twist on the romcom trope makes it entertaining, but the flat characters detract from the otherwise innovative concept. The protagonist, Evie, is a modern damsel in distress just waiting for her Prince Charming to rescue her from her mundane existence. Anderson makes little effort to add depth, so Evie comes off as merely another self-conscious girl with a pretty face and boy troubles. She’s quirky and relatable at times but overall isn’t a very satisfying character.
“No Tomorrow” relies heavily on physical comedy, which occasionally excuses the dialogue’s lack of wit but generally comes off as kitschy. The quick progression of Evie and Xavier’s relationship makes the “rom” component of the show difficult to savor. Consequently, there are few heartwarming moments, and so the show doesn’t stay true to its genre.
A significantly positive aspect of this show, however, is its diverse cast. The show includes actors from several different racial backgrounds and doesn’t adhere too closely to stereotypes, with the exception of Hank (Jonathan Langdon), the loud black best friend without whom no romcom would be complete. Evie’s boss, Deidre (Amy Pietz), is an independent female character—a breath of fresh air in the world of romantic comedy. Unfortunately, Deidre comes off as the stereotypical “bossy” female leader whose personality strikes fear in her employees, which ultimately thwarts the efforts of women’s empowerment. On the other hand, even though Evie may be a passive character in some respects, she ultimately stands her ground against the men in her life and makes her own decisions to improve her future.
Overall, the characters generally lack depth, but the show’s premise is clever, innovative, and even promising, assuming chemistry among the cast grows as the season progresses. “No Tomorrow” airs Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. EST on the CW.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maria Semple’s third novel follows Eleanor Flood, a middle-aged, married mother who finds herself in the midst of a midlife crisis; one morning, she decides she will change her monotonous life and tells herself, as the title indicates, that “Today Will Be Different.” After her previous novels, “This One Is Mine” and “Where’d You Go, Bernadette” (the latter of which is a national bestseller), Semple has built herself an impressive following of readers who love her stories for their middle-aged, married mother characters and for Semple’s entertaining style and timely humor. However, the overall plot of this story lacks the coherence it needs to be an effective  novel. “Today Will Be Different” is ultimately too erratic to successfully build depth, despite the quirky style, humor, and relatability of its main character.
One of Semple’s few successes is her ability to make Eleanor more personable to readers through witty humor. Countless timely jokes that make the reader smile and serve to make Eleanor more accessible with their normality are interspersed throughout “Today Will Be Different.” “... I half expected a disco song to erupt, but instead it was giggles. God bless the gay and the young. Or the gay and the gay,” says Eleanor about her gay former colleague and eight year-old son Timby who, based on the fact that he enjoys wearing makeup, Eleanor believes may be gay. Some jokes describe moments that may actually have occurred in the lives of many of the parents reading the novel: “Timby said[,] ‘Piper Veal called me a bad word…[The first letter was] C.’ [Eleanor] said, “A third grader called you the c-word?’ Timby replied, ‘Yeah. Cow.’” Semple further actualizes her character by incorporating visuals to accompany the story. Eleanor, for example, is trying to be a writer and graphic novelist, and Semple includes actual pages of her mini graphic novel, “The Flood Girls,” to substantiate and make Eleanor more tangible and real. While this is far from the first time that an author has included their characters’ art inside a novel, this artistic decision flows well enough that the reader can imagine a reality in which the drawings, and by extension Eleanor and her situation, seem real.
Semple’s downfall lies in her failure to create depth, thus making moments of attempted profundity come across as scattered. Semple throws in touching maxims that ring true but that in the end have no meaning given the context. “‘That’s the thing about hard times…. Generally speaking, one survives,” says Eleanor, about having to buy clothes in the “chunky section” as a child. “I’d turn fifty in May. My accomplishments? To most people they’d be the stuff of pipe dreams. Anything I’d set out to achieve in this lifetime, I’d done it with grace to spare. Except loving well the people I loved the most,” she realizes while Eleanor’s friend Alonzo plays a magic trick on Timby. Perhaps this is Semple’s way of saying that moments of realization and clarity come in the most random and unexpected times, but within the novel, the moments themselves seem so random and unexpected they lose whatever depth they were initially meant to create.
Another major flaw in the novel is the incongruence of the second and third acts. The revealing nature of second act, which goes over an important relationship of Eleanor’s, and the nonsensicality of the third act, which reveals why Eleanor’s husband, Joe, has been acting strange, essentially cancel each other out. In the third act, Eleanor finally accepts and understands that what she thought was buried in the depths of her mind is actually ruling her everyday life; she prides herself for getting to this point, but Semple confuses the realization with her characterization of Joe. By the end of the novel, his actions go directly against a trait central to his being and by extension, to their marriage. Why move Eleanor forward only to set Joe back, fundamentally crumbling another major relationship in Eleanor’s life? The lack of explanation for such a decision leaves a significant plot hole.
It is no easy feat to write a novel up to par with one as successful as “Where’d You Go, Bernadette.” Unfortunately, Semple’s “Today Will Be Different” is no exception to the rule. Though she tries to balance depth with her signature humor, Semple cannot salvage an overall message of moving forward in a period of stagnancy and immovability, as the idea is lost in the erraticism of this ultimately disappointing third novel.

To the editor:
Y2Y Harvard Square, a program of the Phillips Brooks House Association, is a student-run shelter for young adults ages 18-24. We are made up of over 200 students, many of whom are involved in social justice causes on campus and beyond, including advocating on behalf of the Harvard University Dining Services workers in their negotiations with Harvard University.
In reference to the article published in The Crimson on Friday, we wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our relationship with our partners on Harvard’s campus, and the impact the strike is having on our operations. As a program of PBHA, a separately incorporated non-profit organization recognized by Harvard College, we have been the recipients of generous support from Harvard University, in the form of food from HUDS donated through Food for Free. This has come in addition to significant donations of kitchen equipment, which allowed us to open our doors in December of last year. Y2Y recognizes that the ongoing negotiations, and the amount of food available for donation are outside of HUDS’ control. We are deeply thankful for their continuing partnership.
Food for Free, a Cambridge-based nonprofit organization that provides food to a range of local human service agencies, contacted us immediately upon learning about potential challenges with their anticipated donation. We are incredibly grateful to Food for Free and the many other community members who have worked tirelessly to provide alternative food sources, and our shelves are fully stocked in preparation for when we open our doors for the winter tomorrow night.
We are committed to serving our guests during this challenging time, and look forward to a successful resolution of negotiations, to continue our immensely productive and collaborative relationship with HUDS and Food for Free.

Anais M. Carell ’17, an applied math concentrator in Mather House, is the administrative director of Y2Y Harvard Square. She writes on behalf of Y2Y Harvard Square's staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Holy Cross students were on fall break this week, but the football team surely did not take any time off.
Using contributions from all over the field, the Crusaders (3-4, 1-1 Patriot) emerged victorious over Harvard, 27-17, at Fitton Field in Worcester, Mass. The Crimson (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) had won its last 16 non-conference games and also its last 16 road games, but this loss snapped both of those winning streaks.
The absences of senior quarterback Joe Viviano, junior running back Semar Smith, and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley upset Harvard’s rhythm, and the offense looked significantly less comfortable than it had in the previous four games.
“You want me to start counting how many starters we have out on defense?” Holy Cross coach Tom Gilmore said. “No sympathy for the other team there. Listen, we have a lot more starters and players out right now than they did. That just doesn’t hold water with me.”
Sophomore quarterback Tom Stewart got the start in lieu of Viviano, and he fumbled three times, two of which were recovered by Holy Cross. The Crusaders sacked the Dallas, Texas native six times, and he threw an interception late in the fourth quarter which ultimately secured the game for Holy Cross.
“We just didn’t get a chance to execute our whole offense and get a good momentum going,” Firkser said. “It wasn’t necessarily any different with Tom in.”
Late in the first quarter, senior linebacker Kyle Young hit a scrambling Stewart near the goal line. The ball popped out of Stewart’s hands, and junior linebacker Brett Laurie dove on it in the end zone to take a 21-7 lead.
A penalty on the kickoff prior to this play was integral in the Crusaders’ touchdown. Sophomore Alex LaPolice returned the kick to the 23, but a block in the back moved the Crimson to its own 12 yard line. This penalty, like the four other infractions that Harvard incurred, led to a momentous play and a missed scoring opportunity.
However, receivers Joey Foster (senior) and Brian Dunlap (sophomore) did their best to overcome these penalties, not to mention the absence of Shelton-Mosley. Foster and Dunlap combined for 121 receiving yards, and stalwart senior tight end Anthony Firkser added another 72.
Despite the relative effectiveness of the aerial attack, Harvard’s ground game was largely ineffective all day, and the Crimson only accumulated 26 net rushing yards.
Smith, who had averaged 84.8 yards per game, was supplanted in the backfield by sophomore Noah Reimers and freshman Lavance Northington on Saturday.
While Reimers did score a crucial first quarter touchdown that gave the Crimson its only lead of the day, both backs were unable to consistently break through Holy Cross’ defensive line.
Harvard owned the best third-down conversion percentage of any FCS team heading into Saturday’s contest (58 percent), but the Crimson only picked up first downs on four of 15 third downs against the Crusaders. Harvard often failed to get within scoring range and concluded many drives with forced or unforced turnovers.
“We didn’t control the line of scrimmage enough,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We weren’t really consistently moving the ball and put too much pressure on our defense.
Unlike the offense, Harvard’s defensive unit was mostly intact this week. Like the offense, the defense struggled.
Despite the loss of standout senior quarterback Peter Pujals to a lower leg injury, Holy Cross had no problem putting points on the board.
Led by sophomore signal caller Geoff Wade, who threw for 244 yards on 23 for 35 passing, the Crusaders capitalized on a lack of turnovers to score two touchdowns and kick two field goals on offense. Wade was sacked five times, but he did not fumble or throw an interception.
Both teams seemed to slow down offensively in the second half, and it took a crucial play in the third quarter to put Holy Cross up by a touchdown.
With a fresh set of downs on the Crusaders’ 40, Wade tossed a deep bomb to senior wideout Jake Wieczorek. Wieczorek hauled in the ball in stride to pick up 53 yards without facing significant pressure from Harvard’s secondary.
“Just miscommunication on the back end,” captain Sean Ahern said. “Just not being on the same page. We had a gameplan in place and we just didn’t execute, simple as that.”
Despite a false start and two rushes for losses, the Crusaders tacked on three points on a field goal from senior kicker Zane Wasp.
Senior and freshman wide receivers Brendan Flaherty and Domenic Cozier were the main offensive weapons for Holy Cross.
Cozier is listed as a wide receiver, but he filled in at running back and performed admirably, running for 112 yards on 16 carries. Flaherty accumulated 96 yards on eight catches with a touchdown, and he ran for some significant gains on end-arounds.
“These [Harvard] guys aren’t used to losing,” Murphy said. “I’m sure they would look at it as adversity. We just didn’t do the things you needed to do to beat a good football team.”

After months of anticipation, the new Mediterranean small-plates restaurant En Boca recently opened on Holyoke Street. We at Flyby decided to empty out our pockets to give it a try, so you know what to expect should you ever want to try it out.
At first, we were impressed by the service. When making a reservation over the phone, the receptionist asked if my party had any dietary needs, to which I appreciatively responded, “Yes, my friend has a gluten allergy!”
Upon arriving at the restaurant, we found that the receptionist was a bit too friendly—despite telling him that we were underage, he gave us a three-minute spiel on all their fancy wine options. He continued to comment on the weather and began talking about how his ex-girlfriend never saw snow until she was 25, at which point we started wondering how it was that we had already learned so much about our receptionist’s personal life.
Our waiter—cordial and mildly snooty—recommended that everyone at our table order three to four plates of food. Given that each one-ounce plate cost an average of $17, the two of us weren’t particularly keen on spending $136 on one meal. We decided to split three dishes between the two of us: a Tuscan kale salad, lamb meatballs, and a wood grilled bavette.
We were first served the Tuscan kale salad. We found it to be a little bitter, not too flavorful, with an unappealing arrangement of sauces.
 The meatballs and falafel in tomato sauce was our favorite dish out of the three, yet it was by no means exquisite. Given that we were paying $14 for three balls of meat and three balls of falafel, our standards were high and our expectations unmet.
 Finally, our waiter brought out the bavette, which is just a bougie term for steak cut from a cow’s abs or buttocks. The dish smelled putrid and was by no means visually appealing. Once again, it was tolerable, but we were not at all impressed by the flavor.
