After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Henry Louis Gates, Jr:  
I and your colleagues in the Department of African and African American Studies at Harvard are outraged by your arrest by the Cambridge Police at your home on July 16, 2009.  After seeing a filmed statement of the police spokeswoman, who described your arrest as tantamount to an unfortunate incident that was inspired by misbehavior on both your and the arresting officer’s part, I feel compelled to write to you.  As your friend, co-author, co-teacher, and colleague, I can say honestly that in the many contexts in which I have seen you over many years, I have never known you to exhibit tumultuous or disorderly conduct.  I certainly speak for myself and also, I trust, for all of AAAS, when I state that I believe your account of the events and support you in every way.  Indeed, we are proud of you and rejoice that tonight you will receive acclaim by CNN for your scholarship and leadership in bringing knowledge of African and African American history and culture to a wide, even international public.  We commend you for this, while also realizing that to be black in America brings painful situations such as what you are now experiencing.  
I have known personally great people, specifically historian John Hope Franklin, federal appellate court judge Damon Keith, and Howard University law professor Patricia Worthy, to have experienced insult at the very height of their careers.  The insidious nature of racial presumption is that the offending white person is often unaware of his or her insulting actions and has no deliberate intention to commit a racist act.  For Franklin and Keith, the humiliating incidents were not police-related, but they were unfortunately all too common experiences for many black people.  Nor have successful black persons been immune from police arrest or harassment, even though innocent of any crime.  Racial profiling by the police has long been a subject of discussion by academics, lawyers, and ordinary citizens, and sensitivity sessions have clearly not yielded a transformed police force.  
I was particularly proud to read your statement in which you identified and sympathized with black people far less privileged than yourself, who undergo similar arrest and even more suffering.  As you remarked, their stories rarely make the national news.  We will probably never know the full emotional state of the policeman who came to your own home in the belief that you were breaking and entering.  We do know you, however.  Rest assured we are in your corner.  
Evelyn B. Higginbotham is the chair of the Harvard African and American American Studies department and the Victor S. Thomas Professor of History and of African and African American Studies.

SEOUL, South Korea — What Iraq and Afghanistan taking up the airwaves, it’s easy to forget that for the past 50 years, thousands of American troops have been stationed in South Korea. This commitment is scheduled to decrease in 2012, when the US will hand over wartime operation control of forces back to the Korean military. This gesture is only the latest scale back for the American military in Korea, which has been dialing down its presence over the past decade.
On a day-to-day basis, the slow withdrawal of American forces does not make a big impact on Korea. The troops here have few protective duties; they serve as a “tripwire,” insurance against a possible North Korean attack. However, this tripwire will likely become a vital part of international security in the next few years. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il is a dying man. He has not prepared his 24-year old son and heir, Kim Jong-Un, for succession. Now, the world is stuck with a boy-king who is ill-trained to fend off power-hungry generals bred on Pyongyang’s “military first” policy. Such is the North Korea of nightmares, where nuclear weapons are not a carefully-kept international tease, but a valuable trump card in a close domestic power struggle. 
Faced with this situation, it seems absurd that the U.S. military plans to scale back in any way. There are 28,500 American troops in Korea right now, and that is a good price for détente on the peninsula. The peace and stability of Seoul, Tokyo, and Shanghai are of great interest to the United States. To this end, the present deployment is a cheaper solution than attempting North Korean regime change, and more effective than placing sanctions on a government that will let its people starve rather than cooperate.
Just as Americans should recognize the benefits of troops in Korea, so should South Koreans. The public here has often been unreasonably hostile towards the U.S. troop presence. In the 2002 Winter Olympics, after a Korean speed skater was passed over for the gold medal after being judged to have blocked an American skater, there were protests here against American troops. That same year, anti-American sentiment broke out throughout the country after two Korean schoolgirls were accidentally run over by a tank during an American military training exercise. These outbursts of conflict reflect simmering anger among Koreans at the relative weakness of their military, compared to their highly productive economy. Since the end of the Korean War, the South Korean economy has developed enormously. The fact that their military ability remains inadequate is more than a little confusing and embarrassing to them.
But despite their fierce national pride, under the present circumstances, I think it’s possible that South Koreans will discard their stereotypes of American troops and recognize the benefits of their presence, at least until the North Korean regime stabilizes. The Korean border is 40 kilometers from the Seoul metropolitan area, in which half the population of South Korea lives. Across it, North Korea has around 1.2 million troops—the fifth largest land force in the world, because the Kim regime prioritizes bullets over bread. South Korea presently spends 3 percent of its GDP on defense, and without American troops that number would certainly go up, at precipitous cost to the Korean economy. 
And, in fact, to some degree such recognition is already happening—in the past three weeks, legislators of the ruling Grand National Party have joined the traditionally less Washington-friendly Democratic Party to ask America for a reconsideration of the 2012 transfer.
In the midst of this political jockeying, life for American GIs in Seoul goes on. A group of us Harvard interns celebrated the 4th of July at Yongsan Army base, the headquarters of the U.S. military in Korea. We had expected a quintessentially American festival, but the one we got was also distinctly Korean. At Yongsan there were plenty of hamburgers and bratwurst, but the main attraction was a Korean pop concert featuring A-listers the Brown Eyed Girls and SG Wannabee. The crowd was a mix of Korean and American army families. The 8th Army Band featured both Korean and American soldiers, and they played both Gershwin’s “Summertime” and Korean folk songs. The festival was a balance between two very proud cultures; hopefully such understanding can be reached on more serious military matters as well.

ROME, Italy—Last weekend, I went to the Roman forum with a friend who had just arrived from Paris.  It was hot and he was disgruntled.  Nothing was labeled in a helpful manner (a few bronze plaques here and there, some in Latin) and it was difficult to distinguish between the various structures.  I stood in the sun and read to him from a guidebook, pleading with him to use his imagination. 
“This,” he declared with scorn, “would never happen in Paris. Things would be indicated, displayed artfully.”
Immediately, I felt a patriotic defensiveness for a country not truly my own.  (Yes, I have spent many vacations here living with my grandmother and I love the place deeply, but I am not Italian.)
“Paris,” I countered, meeting his scorn with ennui, “is not this beautiful.” 
Of course, I did not convince him; in fact, he is not, strictly speaking, wrong.  It is true that the ancient ruins of the forum are poorly indicated (if at all), that the Palatine is no better, that there is not even much of the original structures left to see, and that—in a city where tourism is a primary industry—this lack of attention to such detail seems bizarre.  It is also probably true that if Rome were Paris things might be labeled, maybe even with explanations in three or four languages.  Rome, however, is not Paris.  
So, here’s my defense of the way the Romans have handled their ancient treasures: There is value to leaving structures, remnants of the past, in ruins.  There is worth in seeing things fallen but not forgotten, in letting things be the way they are, in neither rebuilding nor destroying.  There is value in not labeling everything, classifying it as though the capitol were some giant museum or a large still life.  Rome is very much a living city, and the ruins are part of its vivaciousness.  For centuries, millennia really, Italians have been building over, incorporating, and generally bastardizing their ruins. And it works for them. 
The choice does, perhaps, induce a sense of discomfort in tourists.  It isn’t the neat, tidy housekeeping that sight-seers (myself included when I travel) tend to appreciate when they visit a place.  Tourists often want to know what they are seeing and why it is important in one minute or less—as if to say, “Good, now we’ve done this.  Next.”  The way the Roman forum is set up does not allow for that.  One has to sit or stand, staring and discerning, guidebook in hand, perhaps even imagining things long past.  There’s no handholding here.  
But there is a deeper reason for the disquiet tourists might feel looking at ancient Roman ruins, in particular the Roman forum: melancholy.  It is beautiful and yet sad.  The ruins are majesty fallen; they are things gone and not memorialized, but rather left to simply be.  “And look,” one has to think, “present-day Italians, once Romans, once the most powerful people in the world, can’t even get it together to label the rubble.”  
I admit that the choice not to make the forum completely user friendly might not actually be a choice per se. Perhaps Italians don’t know how to handle their ancient treasures in a tourist-pleasing manner.  In this sense, my friend might be right, but visitors must take Roman ruins on their own terms.  The bitter-sweet taste might not induce comfort, but it does make you think.

KUTCH, India — In the rural region of Kutch in Northwest India, 140 kids—preschoolers through 7th graders—travel to Sadhu Vaswani School six days a week to learn math, science, social studies, English, Gujarati, Hindi, and basic computer skills. The school faces daunting challenges as it attempts to educate students from 14 regional villages, some more than 50 kilometers away, with only one school bus to provide transportation over these long distances. Most of the villages where students live did not have electricity until a few years ago, and most children are the first in their families to attend school.  As an English medium school (all subjects are taught in English), it struggles to find teachers that can teach in English, because most qualified instructors live in Bhuj, the nearest urban center, which is 40 kilometers away. Even if teachers are willing to travel the distance, the pay is meager, forcing them to hold a second job after the school day ends. Sadhu Vaswani faces competition for funding and enrollment from other, better-funded Gujarati medium schools.
The largest challenge the school has to face, however, is recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2001 that completely leveled the entire region, leaving almost all buildings in absolute shambles. In the wake of the earthquake, the region has rebounded in a dramatic fashion. Local and state authorities have worked with NGOs and relief organizations to rebuild the local area, and to fundamentally change its economic environment, attracting droves of new business by making Kutch a tax-free zone. Now, there are more jobs than people in Kutch, and every child can dream of holding a real government or corporate job, if only they go to school. Thus, no matter the unbearable heat, the demands of the farm at home, or the long distances, 140 kids are eager to learn in English in what was formerly one of the most rural areas of the country.

CHICAGO, Ill. – Its a buzz word, its hot right now—but, what does it really mean? What does public health actually look like? I was hoping to answer these questions as I arrived in Chicago, ready to work with children and families affected by HIV and AIDS on the north side of the city. I had imagined an environment somewhere in between a scene from ER (complete with someone convulsing on a stretcher), and a slow day in my elementary school nurse’s office, but what I got was quite different. As a pre-med, I had always assumed that public health was removed from the patient, that it was about long term and broad changes, and that actual people suffering from illness and disease got lost in the melee of pamphlets, walks for causes, and mass emails. I was wrong.
True, public health uses different tools than traditional medicine employs, but it operates with the same intensity as medicine, and with the simple objective of making people better. This summer, I have seen public health fill the cracks in a patient’s well being.  T provides the extra boost beyond the medication. Although I have aspirations of being a doctor, this summer has taught me that social workers, therapists, and case managers are equally vital in making sure all of the needs of the individual are met. It is as crucial that our patients can afford the bus fare to get to the hospital as it is for a doctor to diagnose them when they arrive.. The results of an HIV lab test mean nothing when you don’t have an apartment, or anyone caring for your children. This revelation—that the multi-faceted approach to care exists and is in practice—has not only surprised me, but elated me as well.
Just as we learn back in Cambridge during the fall, winter, and spring, crossing disciplines and engaging our peers from other fields yields a more holistic and beneficial result in the real world than simply focusing on one area. It is for this reason that when our states, and our country, changes the way we provide healthcare, we must consider the people beyond those wearing white coats. Whether we move towards a single payer system, more socialized physician groups, or a different iteration of systems already in practice across other developed nations, we cannot leave citizens of the lower class with pills and no plan. We must provide ample support to human and social services, and non-profits and local clinics. I have seen adults, children, and infants experience their quality of life improve because professionals of all kinds worked together on their behalf. To care for the whole person, you need the whole team.

CÓRDOBA, Spain—Tourists from all over the world come here for one reason: to see the Mezquita (Spanish for “mosque”) that was built when Cordoba was part of the Muslim-ruled kingdom of al-Andalus. Although it is widely considered to be one of the finest achievements of the Western Islamic Empire, you wouldn’t know it from reading the information pamphlet provided at the entrance. 
The section entitled “The Islamic Intervention” is indicative of the general drift of the text, which characterizes the creation of the Mezquita as an unfortunate hiccup in the history of what was always meant to be a Christian church. Some passages go so far as to dismiss the originality of the structure, claiming that almost all of the architectural elements were copied from Christian buildings, while others accuse a later Muslim addition to the edifice as being merely an “ostentatious display of power,” and even worse, cheaply constructed. 
However, one glance around the interior gave me the impression that the monument actually suffered from being converted back into a church after Christian monarchs finally conquered Cordoba. The Renaissance cathedral added inside the Mezquita after its conversion would be fairly standard if it stood alone, but it seems wildly out of place amidst the elegant red and white Islamic arches.  
Apart from its thinly veiled disdain for the Mezquita’s creators, what makes the pamphlet even more of a curiosity is the incongruity between its overtly religious slant and current Spanish attitudes. 
Despite Spain’s historical reputation as one of the most Catholic countries in Europe, and although most Spaniards still identify themselves as culturally Catholic, religion seems to be of little real importance in people’s daily lives here. Church attendance is at an all-time low and the only people I have ever seen attend Mass are elderly individuals. The tone of the pamphlet suggests a level of religious dogmatism that is clearly out of touch with the reality of modern Spain.
And while it is understandable that the Catholic Church should desire to push back the rising tide of secularism in Spain, providing vaguely bigoted information to the Mezquita’s visitors is an inappropriate way to make such a stand. The Mezquita is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its stewards would do well to acknowledge and celebrate all aspects of that heritage. Anything short of that does a terrible disservice to this outstanding example of cultural fusion.

NORTH POINT, Hong Kong — Vignettes from the Island Line.
A fish jumps out of a woman’s plastic bag in the candy shop as I’m making my way over, eyeing the sour straws. I jump back and scream. The workers gather round and close the plastic bag over the fish after many attempts. The bag still flops.
I roll over a woman’s foot with my 50-pound suitcase. She gives me a look of venomous wrath. I mentally prepare for a brawl.  This happens about eight times with an eclectic collection of furious passersby.
Man punches pregnant woman at Macau customs. Chaos ensues.
Bird’s nest lining is on the menu—maybe I’m not the adventurous vegetarian I thought I was.
A lot of residents chow down on McDonald’s instead of dim sum.
People don’t appreciate when you speak Mandarin. Or often understand, for that matter.
It’s not easy to pick up Cantonese. Unless you really want to say “Please hold the handrail.”
Walking is optional. Escalators are mandatory.  So is air-conditioning. 
If you don’t know the details of the Nina Wang case, you’re on another planet, or illiterate.
No one EVER crosses the road unless the beeping light is green. If you jaywalk, you’re a foreigner, or drunk. Or possibly both.
Malicious people throw acid off of buildings in Mong Kok.
The Chief Executive is known for wearing a bow-tie. And mocked.
A waitress implores me to eat fish. “You’ll have no energy.” I slump over some flavorless noodles—“my energy is FINE. Look how energetic I am now!” 
A woman from the mainland convulses in sobs over Michael Jackson’s death.
My cooking is bad. Okay, not a surprise. Note to self: Wasabi does not solve all culinary adventures.
Why America should not be exported: An intern from the mainland self-dubbed “Torrance” (after trying on the names Ditty, Cherry, and Juicy) models her life on the movie Bring it On.
Toilets are not the squat-kind. You don’t have to carry around mini-Charmin’ rolls in your bag.
“Pocari Sweat” is a popular drink. I discover I have an unconsciously self-imposed policy against consuming things that reference sweat.
I argue with a restaurant owner about a supposed mandatory tea charge.  After 20 minutes, she gives up. I’m happy I remain stoic—then I realize I saved about $2, and that all the waiters are sneering at our table. 
An eclipse obscures 75 percent of the sun. Since it happens in the early morning, I’m ordered to write an article as if it already happened, so that the newspaper I work for can print the story in past tense. I worry this will turn into my “Dewey Defeats Truman.” My co-worker convinces me that my article isn’t really that important. I feel only slightly better.
It takes longer to travel the five escalators down to the subway platform than to ride the train itself.
On the street, I recognize people who I’ve seen before, but who don’t actually know me. 
I’m mistaken for a Falun Gong protester in a march against the government and People’s Republic of China
I give up on my own name. “Yes, that’s correct,” I sigh, fighting the urge to once again spell out V-I-D-Y-A when I call and introduce myself as a reporter. “Okay, Bibyc, I’ll call back in an hour,” responds the voice in laborious broken English.
There are a lot of deaths-by-chopping. No, not shopping (though that probably happens too, given the number of malls). Chopping.
The “fragrant harbour” is pretty smelly in some parts. Like, when you pass meat entrails in a bucket. Or eels. This happens often as I walk along the street towards my apartment.
I don’t have swine flu—knock on wood. Many signs inform me that the buttons of most elevators are disinfected every hour.  Or they instruct me on proper “coughing etiquette.”
I can’t decide if I fit in too well or stick out too much.

BATA, Equatorial Guinea — This country is a frightening place for foreigners. With a booming oil rush and billions in American petrol companies’ investments, it is fair to say that the government has no real need for a tourist industry. This became very clear to me on my fourth night in the tiny central African nation.
As I walked along a picturesque marble boardwalk at the ocean’s edge, I decided to take a discreet picture of the sea. Within thirty seconds of removing my camera from my backpack, I felt a strong hand on my shoulder. It spun me around so that I was face to face with an angry military officer, who had a large gun slung across his shoulder. He promptly confiscated my camera and questioned me as to what possible reason I could have for being in the country and taking pictures. The soldier even suggested at one point that I could be a “terrorist.” After a disastrous hour or so trying to explain myself across an impossible language barrier, I finally managed to retrieve my camera—after paying a 30,000CFA bribe (about $60). 
The message was clear: There is no such thing as tourism in this corner of Africa. Ultimately, however, my run-in with the authorities is just another example of the shortsighted mismanagement of Equatorial Guinea. While the government lavishes in oil wealth, the citizenry suffer under the weight of unbearable poverty. Tourism could be an avenue for Guineans outside of the government sector to begin taking control of their own economic potential. The country itself is a vibrant and beautiful place, with landscapes ranging from volcanic mountains to elephant forests to grassy plains and sleepy seaside villages. With the right resources, there could be a thriving adventure tourism scene here that could send some much-needed money towards the general public. Yet, as long as dictatorial president Teodoro Obiang Mbasogo Nguema continues to rule with an oil-soaked iron fist, Equatorial Guinea might as well hang up a giant sign at the airport that says “Go Away.”

LONDON, England – Around two hours into my job at News International, I realized the respect I earned depended almost entirely on just how urgently I could stride, and how conspicuously my shoes could click to punctuate each step.
By Thursday of my third week, I had carefully honed these skills, and attempted to prove myself with an early morning stride-race to the lifts with Janice (who was supposed to be in New York but had presumably marched across the ocean in her hurry to get here).
“Did you get caught in the shit-storm?” asked Janice.
“What?” I replied, resenting her horribly long legs.
“The shit storm. The front page of The Guardian?” She brandished the newspaper in my face.
“Fuck.” (Swearing gives the impression of a hardened realism, which also earns respect).
Regardless of street credit, “fuck” is the appropriate response when the biggest media scandal in years hits the company where you work. The Guardian story exposed allegations that The News of the World—a News International newspaper—is rife with journalists who illegally tap the phones of thousands of prominent British figures. Journalists tend to stride to and attend the same meetings as politicians, the police, and lawyers, and consequentially figures from every one of these forums are embroiled in the scandal. 
Clearly, some authoritative stances were in order, and News International executives would have to strut in a highly self-confident manner to ward off the impact of this story. Throughout the office, men in suits paced the floor and barked firmly into telephones, aggressively cultivating a confident air of authority and pursuing relationships with much-needed allies. 
Other newspapers reacted in form and, impressed by News International’s controlled appearance, rushed to make the appropriately respectful comments in their respective publications. Many newspapers reported The Guardian allegations discreetly within their innermost pages, and reserved the front page for a sensational swine flu story. After all, newspaper executives must all stride in unison.
These confident auras of authority seem at first to have impact, but they’re wearing thin amongst the British public. This year, we’ve discovered the greed of our financial sector, the violent tactics of our police, and the corruption of our politicians in a wave of horrific scandals. Now, whispers are circulating about the illegal practices that take place at every newspaper, and even if further allegations aren’t uncovered, the strength of this story could taint the media as a whole. If the fourth estate of British society crumbles, executives will need more than an authoritative strut and reasurring words to appease cynicism. The British public needs substance behind the self-confident guises of its public institutions.

Tensions surrounding last week's arrest of black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. escalated sharply Wednesday, with the officer involved unequivocally denying any wrongdoing while Gates forcefully called for an apology and U.S. President Barack Obama chastised Cambridge police on national television for arresting the professor."I think [the officer] owes me an apology for what he did," Gates told a Boston television reporter Tuesday night. "He should look into his heart and know that he is not telling the truth and he should beg my forgiveness." Gates has raised the possibility of filing a lawsuit over the arrest.Obama, speaking at a White House press conference aimed at boosting support for health care reform, said that the Cambridge Police Department "acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home" and noted that racial profiling remained a fact in American society. Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick '78 also said today that he was troubled by the incident, and Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons said she spoke to Gates and apologized on behalf of the city.But Sergeant James Crowley, the Cambridge police officer who arrested Gates, said Wednesday that he would not apologize for his actions, saying that he was not a racist and that he was disappointed by the national media intense coverage of the incident. The Cambridge Police Superior Officers Association, which represents 50 police sergeants and lieutenants, also came to Crowley's defense, saying he was a "highly respected veteran supervisor with a distinguished record" and that "his actions at the scene of this matter were consistent with his training, with the informed policies and practices of the Department, and with applicable legal standards."Readers commenting online about the ongoing tumult appear to have divided opinions as well, with some criticizing police for what they see as a racially motivated and imprudent arrest, and others writing that the professor had overreacted to a legitimate police inquiry.The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Police Department dropped the disorderly conduct charge filed against Gates on Tuesday, calling the incident "regrettable and unfortunate." But police spokespeople have repeatedly declined to say whether the move represented an admission of wrongdoing, and Crowley could not be reached for comment at his home by The Crimson on Wednesday.Gates has thus far declined to speak to The Crimson, writing in an e-mailed statement Wednesday night that he has been "overwhelmed by email and phone calls" and "unfortunately" could not address each request individually at the current time. His lawyer and friend, law school professor Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., did not respond to repeated requests for comment by The Crimson.Gates, who has accused Crowley of fabricating information in the police report documenting the incident, has offered to personally educate the officer on the "history of racism in America and the issue of racial profiling." He also said he has been inspired to film a documentary on the subject.The arrest took place last Thursday when a woman reported to police that she saw two men apparently trying to pry open the front door to Gates' home. But in reality, the men entering were likely Gates, who had returned to Cambridge after a trip to China, and his car driver, who was helping him force his way through a jammed front door. When officers arrived to investigate, tensions flared as Gates, who had by then entered the home, angrily and loudly accused the officer of targeting him because he was black, according to police reports.But Gates and his lawyer have said that the professor cooperated fully, providing both his Harvard identification and a drivers license to prove he lived in the home. They said the officer refused to identify himself and lured Gates out of the home to arrest him.Gates told CNN Wednesday evening that even though the incident had upset him greatly, he would "do the same thing exactly again."—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard University Press, whose sales have fallen approximately 10 percent this past year, closed its 61-year-old display room in the Holyoke Center on June 30 after its yearly lease expired at the end of May, according to HUP sales director Susan Donnelly.
Two of the display room's three staffers took the University's early retirement incentive package, Donnelly said, and the third was fired this summer as part of the 275 University-wide layoffs.
Donnelly explained that the display room has always been a net loss for HUP, but it was a cost that they were willing to subsidize until now. She said publishers have been dealt a “double-whammy” by the financial crisis and the transition to digital media.
The display room’s costs consisted of rent and staff salaries, according to Donnelly. In addition to the display room worker who was laid off, HUP fired three staffers in marketing, two in editorial, and one in design—a total of seven layoffs. But HUP is not planning on reducing publishing output, Donnelly emphasized.
The display room had featured a full bookcase of Greek and Latin works from the Loeb Classical Library, as well as other nationally renowned titles.
Brandon K. B. Seah '11 said that “as a poor student,” he enjoyed going to the “Bargain Alcove,” a shelf where damaged books were sold for as little as $4 or $5. He said he would be disappointed if a restaurant or other commercial chain replaces the display room in the Holyoke Center. 
“Then it becomes just like any other place in the Square: very commercial, no local flavor,” Seah said. “It would be catering more to the tourists than the students, which kind of defeats the purpose.”
HUP has also recently signed a deal with Scribd, an online startup founded and headed by a young Harvard duo: John R. “Trip” Adler '06 and Jared Friedman, a Harvard dropout who was a Computer Science concentrator in Cabot House. The deal would put nearly 1,000 of HUP’s books online, making them downloadable at costs determined by HUP.
Scribd would take 20 percent of the profits, and HUP 80 percent. Approximately 300 of HUP’s books are already on Scribd’s web site, according to Adler.
“We think it’s exciting to get a big publisher like Harvard involved, especially because we went to school there,” said Adler, a former Biophysics concentrator.
NYU and MIT's University Presses have also already signed on with Scribd. The company started discussing a deal with HUP about a month ago, according to Adler, after HUP started uploading books to the Web site on their own.
Scribd, which attracted the attention of venture capitalists soon after it was launched in March 2007, currently has almost 50 million users, according to Adler. Books purchased through Scribd can be read on electronic devices, including the iPhone and Amazon Kindle. 
Scribd is also looking to expand into the classroom—Adler said that the company is currently developing an annotation feature, which will allow users to write notes and highlight text on the virtual books using electronic devices. Hopefully, he said, this will allow material on Scribd to compete with physical textbooks.
“We’re hoping to work with Harvard University Press to make textbooks cheaper so [students] can buy them online rather than buying these expensive thick textbooks,” Adler said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Police Department Commissioner Robert C. Haas announced at a
press conference this afternoon that the Department would be assembling
a panel of "independent notable professionals" in coming days to review
and analyze the controversial arrest of black Harvard Professor Henry
Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr. at his own home last Thursday. Haas said the
panel would attempt to "look at the situation in its totality," try to
provide a factual basis for what transpired, and give recommendations
for improvements within the department when faced with similar
circumstances in the future. Nevertheless, Haas said that the
Department had been "deeply pained" by recent criticism of the police's
handling of the incident—including from President Barack Obama—and
added that the department took its professionalism seriously. He said
that such attention is "not the kind of notoriety we want to come to
this city," and maintained that Sergeant James Crowley, the officer who
made the arrest, had done nothing wrong in his handling of the incident.
"I believe that Sergeant Crowley acted in a way that is consistent with
his training at the Department, consistent with national standards of
law enforcement protocol," he said. "I do not believe that his actions
were in any way racially motivated." Instead, Haas said that Crowley
had "assessed the situation, tried to de-escalate the situation, and
made a determination that the only way to stop the situation was to
make an arrest." Haas said that the Department would provide the
review panel with all necessary records, documentation, and police
staff, and that the final report would be available for public review. "I believe that there is always a better way of doing things in the future," he said.
Haas also revealed new information at the press conference today,
noting that Gates' home had previously been broken into, before the
arrest, while the professor was away. He said that he was not exactly
sure when the break-in took place, and that it had been investigated by
Harvard University Police Department. Last Thursday's incident had
transpired when a woman reported to police that she saw two men
apparently trying to pry open the front door to Gates' home. But the
men entering were likely Gates, who had returned to Cambridge after a
trip to China, and his car driver, who was helping him force his way
through a jammed front door. When officers arrived to investigate,
tensions flared as Gates, who had by then entered the home, angrily and
loudly accused the officer of targeting him because he was black,
according to police reports. But Gates and his lawyer have said
that the professor cooperated fully, providing both his Harvard
identification and a drivers license to prove he lived in the home.
They said the officer refused to identify himself and lured Gates out
of the home to arrest him. Haas said that the incident was less a
matter of providing proper identification, however, and that Crowley
made the arrest "as a last resort" after unsuccessfully trying to
de-escalate the tension at the scene. Earlier Thursday, President
Obama said he was "surprised" by the controversy that had erupted over
his comments at a press conference last night, where he had said that
the Cambridge Police acted "stupidly" in arresting Gates. Haas said at
the conference that his officers took the comments to heart and were
"stunned" and "deflated." Haas said that the City and police
decided on Tuesday to drop the disorderly conduct charge filed against
Gates because "we basically felt this was a situation that we needed to
move on from.""We didn't want this to be a prolonged situation,
[and we] needed to focus back on what we do in terms of providing
safety and protection for this community," Haas said.He said that
the decision to drop the charges had been made in consultation with the
Cambridge City Council, Manager, and Solicitor, and said that the
Department had been approached by Gates' attorney first. While
Gates called the officer who arrested him a "rogue cop," Haas said that
Crowley was a "stellar member of this Department" and that he relied on
Crowley's judgment everyday. Nevertheless, he said that the Department
regretted that the incident took place, and said that "nobody's happy
about this situation."—Staff writer Maxwell L. Child can be reached at mchild@fas.harvard.edu

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is considering replacing a $2 billion revolving line of credit with a smaller line of credit that charges a higher interest rate—a move that may constrain the University's cash flexibility during severe economic downturns.
According to Bloomberg, Harvard is negotiating terms on a $1.75 billion line of credit and is willing to pay back any loans at 1.25 percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate, a common reference point for setting floating interest rates. The University's current $2 billion line of credit, set to expire next month, allows it to borrow $250 million more at an interest rate 0.25 percentage points higher than LIB.
The move comes after months of scrutiny and criticism over the University's decision to sell billions of dollars in bonds at high interest rates late last year, as the financial crisis deepened, in order to boost liquidity.
Bloomberg also reported that Harvard may pay an upfront fee to the creditors funding the loan on top of the interest, as well as 0.1 percent interest on any untapped loans.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to discuss the specific terms of the negotiations, but confirmed that the University will renew its revolving line of credit—which allows Harvard to draw additional funds after previous loans are repaid—for the next year.
Citigroup and Bank of America will set up the line of credit for the next year, Bloomberg said. In a report published last April, credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said the previous line of credit was funded by a consortium of banks, but it is unclear whether Citigroup and Bank of America participated. Spokesmen from Bank of America and Citigroup declined to comment.
The Moody's report noted that the $2 billion line of credit served as a source of "additional liquidity flexibility," though it does not qualify as "same-day liquidity"—a measure of an institution's ability to meet cash demands quickly. At the time, the ratings agency issued a stable outlook for Harvard's credit rating based in part on its "maintenance of strong liquidity and capital ratios." 
During December and January, Harvard completed a $2.5 billion bond offering to bolster its cash reserves, as well as to refinance riskier forms of debt. Several media outlets have suggested that the University held insufficient cash reserves, and Forbes magazine wrote that Harvard had found itself in a "cash-raising panic" in the midst of the economic recession.
Earlier this year, the University's Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore rejected this depiction of Harvard's finances, saying that the bond offering had been issued "quite competitively given market conditions at the time."
The recession and the projected 30 percent decline in endowment value have forced Harvard to enact sweeping budget cuts, from laying off workers to slowing down ambitious capital projects in Allston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergoes a number of subtle changes during the summer: There’s a little more sunshine, a few less people, and a whole lot more smiling. As a result, summer school students seem to relish time outdoors a bit more than their term-time counterparts, which has led to another quiet change in campus life—the resurgence of intramurals.
Despite the absence of IM reps to pester summer residents for participation, the Secondary School and General Program have demonstrated surprising enthusiasm for these competitions. While the Straus Cup resides safely in 2009-champion Winthrop House, shielded from the influence of June and July results, summer school athletics director Lisa Harchut ’11 has found the key to promoting intramural attendance without the appeal of inter-house rivalry—by tapping into the desire for personal glory.
In addition to standard weekly contests in soccer, basketball, and Frisbee, the activities office has offered a number of weekend tournaments that do not pit Houses and dorms against one another, but instead favor open entry, allowing students to form teams across residences. The result has been a greater focus on individual achievement, with high schoolers and college folk alike striving not for Canaday or Kirkland pride, but rather for personal bragging rights on Harvard’s hallowed battlegrounds of grass, wood, and asphalt.
Yet, I approached my first of these weekend tournaments (five-on-five soccer) as a skeptic. But the students far exceeded our expectations, fielding 12 different teams (try getting every House to show up to an event in the fall) in a hard-fought weekend at the IM fields. This tournament also successfully integrated SSP and college students, with the younger contingent enthusiastically representing the majority while the older (and largely international) participants brought a measure of significant talent to the pitch.
As the IM season has progressed, the weekend contests have grown no less popular, boasting large crowds at Beren Tennis Center and Weld Boathouse last weekend for the tennis tournament and river run, respectively. The tennis matches featured over 50 players of various skill levels, sorted into four singles brackets (two men’s and two women’s) and a doubles draw. While the most talented players may have competed in singles, the highlight of the weekend played out in an epic doubles draw, where a certain strikingly handsome and talented Crimson sports editor and one of his proctees claimed the championship without dropping a set.
With kickball and three-on-three basketball remaining on the tournament agenda, it appears likely that excitement for summer IMs will carry through the term.
After observing such promising attendance, a question arises: Has the summer activities staff hit upon a more effective intramural approach? Could open-entry tournaments provide a bigger draw than Straus Cup competition? Or do the summer students simply take advantage of nicer weather and more free time? While the latter must certainly influence these popular competitions, it appears that an appeal to individual fame has won out over community pride.
Of course, summer champions have also been known to receive bounties of CVS candy—another trick well worth noting for term-time organizers.
