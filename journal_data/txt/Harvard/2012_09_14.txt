After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Gov 1310 cheating scandal, implicating 125 students in allegedly illicit collaboration on a final exam, has been national news for over two weeks. The most recent episode in the evolving saga occurred on Tuesday, when it was reported that basketball co-captains Kyle D. Casey ’13 and Brandyn T. Curry ’13 were both involved in the scandal. Casey has apparently withdrawn for the semester, and Curry may reportedly follow suit. Similarly, many on the football team are bracing for changes in lineup as a result of the scandal. What’s more, assistant professor Matthew B. Platt indicated to the Ad Board in a letter early this summer that several of the students under investigation were members of the baseball team.
 
Indeed, one source has suggested that athletes make up a disproportionate number of those 125. While we know that many athletes were implicated, it is equally likely that dozens of non-athletes are also under investigation. There is no value in drawing generalizations from insufficient evidence; nor is there any cause to excuse the academically dishonest or minimize their transgression. Rather, we ought to ask ourselves what circumstances, contexts, and pressures are most conducive to dishonest behavior, so that we can diminish them.
 
One of Harvard’s defining characteristics is the intensity with which we approach extracurriculars. Be it in the context athletics, journalism, social organizations, or political groups, we often give ourselves over entirely to our organizations. Academics, for many, become a distinctly secondary priority for much of our careers at school. It is not hard to imagine how, in this environment, benign instances of cutting corners like sharing study guides over an email list may make actual actions of academic dishonesty that much more feasible. Most listserves serve as exchanges of all kinds of information on courses, books, and professors. They facilitate collaboration, and without proper self-discipline, people may use them as channels for illicit collaboration.
 
While we cannot be sure whether it played a role in this particular scandal, it is worth noting the undue pressure many Harvard students place on themselves to get impossibly high grades. In a community where anything less than a B is frequently considered a mark of failure in a class, and grade point average is thought to be one of the main determinants of future happiness, individuals may be more inclined to cheat than they otherwise might.
 
None of this is to excuse those who broke the crystal-clear prohibition against “discuss[ing] the exam with others.” It is, however, useless to deny that a campus culture and certain circumstances might be more conducive to upright behavior than others. As a student body, we should be aware of the negative consequences of treating academics as a second-tier responsibility, while still holding our academic success as vital. It creates a game where the stakes are a lot higher than the amount of effort we are willing or able to put in. Being busy is never an excuse for dishonesty.

Think the two-party system stinks? If you’re like 60 percent of Americans, you agree that the Democratic and Republican Parties don’t accurately represent the views of the nation. Well, I’ve got good news for you: neither party will exist in its current state within five years. The party dynamic that has existed uneasily since the 1980 election is not just dying, it’s already been killed. That’s right, the zombie apocalypse has finally come, and the walking dead hold our nation’s capital.
 
Tectonic shifts in American politics over the past 10 years have all but ensured that the current bipolar system is failing, leaving both parties hopelessly corrupted and an entire electorate disillusioned. The decrease in effectiveness of the tools from which the parties derive their powers, coupled with desperate tactics they use to stay relevant, has strained the system to its breaking point.
 
Party dominance in fundraising is evaporating. In the Age of the Super PAC, the party is not the critical source of funding that it used to be. Under the McCain-Feingold system of campaign finance, a candidate can only personally receive $2,500 a year from a given donor, while the national, state, and local party can together receive $45,800 in the same year. These rules enable the party to receive an immense amount of money and therefore power. However, a candidate’s affiliated Super PAC can receive an unlimited amount of money. A major donor can donate “a la carte” to his or her candidate of choice without limit while circumventing the party altogether. As a result, candidates require party support much less than they did before the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling.
 
Knowing that their direct power is waning, at least one party has capitalized on the sole advantage they still hold onto: brand loyalty. Merely holding the endorsement of either the Republican or Democratic parties historically guarantees a presidential candidate 40 percent of the total vote, with elections being won or lost in the fight for the approximate fifth of so-called swing voters. Similar statistics, though obviously dependent on year and area, exist for down-ticket candidates. The Republicans have been ruthless in circling the wagons and enforcing party loyalty, casting out apostates as RINO’s (Republicans in Name Only). Since the 2008 election, though, over 2.5 million voters have left the two parties, while the share of unaffiliated voters has steadily grown over the years.
 
The Republican Party in particular is ready to burst. To see the party rupturing at its seams, look no further than it’s two top congressional leaders. Speaker of the House John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) represents the classical conception of the modern Republican Party, a midwestern, pragmatic country club conservative who is ultimately willing to reach across the aisle to make deals. Meanwhile, Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.) has been leading a successful insurrection within the party ranks, embodying a much more extreme form of conservative zealotry. Such is the wing responsible for much of the more terrifying and infuriating chapters of the 112th Congress. Tension has gotten so high that aides for the two supposed allies had to call a secret “truce” with one another. The Party is a house divided which cannot stand for much longer.
 
Mitt Romney may be the Brahmin that broke the camel’s back. His main selling point is that he embodies the Platonic ideal of the Republican: the business expertise, the deeply held religious ethic, the perfect hair. But the repeated fiery ascents and collapses of candidates high on demagoguery and low on plausibility—in rough chronology Trump, Bachmann, Perry, Cain, Gingrich, Santorum, Gingrich—has shown that there is a major wing of the party that can no longer accept this kind of perceived moderate.
 
Such deep party divisions may lead to a full-scale schism. Try 1948, when southern Democrats angered by the strong government and racial integration policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt (Class of 1904) and Harry S. Truman seceded from the party to become the “Dixiecrats” before being absorbed by the Republicans. Or 1912, when Teddy Roosevelt (Class of 1880) established the Bull Moose Party that broke the Republican party into “progressive” and “conservative” wings for decades to come.
 
If Romney loses this November, watch out for a GOP internecine war developing between now and 2016, one that might end with a Tea Party secession and moderates from both parties allying under a new moderate, something like Obama without the baggage he’s accrued in his first term.
 
Though the chance of this brewing realignment to affect the 2012 election may have passed, don’t be surprised if a party with the last name like Bloomberg or Huntsman or Petraeus starts to shake up the red and blue on a map sometime in the not-too-distant future.

Phrases like “climate change” and “global warming” lose their meaning when repeated too often. But when global warming smacks you in the face, you suddenly realize that it’s real. I want to tell you how climate change affected my life. I hope that my story will breathe new significance into these sometimes-tired phrases and deepen your perspective on what is happening to our planet.
I grew up in Maine—the land of lobsters, blueberries, and pine trees. I always felt safe in Maine because of its strong community, pristine nature, and lack of life-threatening weather conditions. But I have learned that Maine’s idyllic traits are deceiving. It’s not as safe as I thought, and neither is any other place in the world. The reason: climate change. It was 11 p.m. on the night of July 2, 2009. The sky was bright with lightning. A furious downpour engulfed our farm as I watched from my bedroom window. I heard an earsplitting crack and felt the floor vibrate beneath me. The house filled with the sounds of security and fire alarms all screaming at once. I knew that lightning had hit our house. Smoke was billowing from the ground floor. My mom called 911 on my cellphone.
The smoke evicted us from our home as it poured out of every wall. I couldn’t breathe. I felt like the hand of fate was squeezing all the air out of me. I was living my worst childhood nightmare as we stood out in the storm and watched the first flames leap out a lower floor window. I screamed. For the first time ever, I could feel my heart pound as if it would break through my chest. It took nine minutes for the fire-trucks to arrive. They were too late. They say that lightning hit the electrical system. Fire quickly overwhelmed every part of the home that I cherished, the heart and soul of my family’s life, the scene of my childhood, and all our memories. It was the place where we made music, read books, had pajama parties, and celebrated life. It was where I fell in love with nature: my axis mundi, my launching pad, my paradise. It’s where I learned to read and play piano. It’s where my brother and I laughed and played all summer. That night I witnessed the death of my home. It was like watching a family member shriek in agony. My family lost everything. We promised each other that we would love one another forever and thanked the world for not taking our lives.
It’s been three years since the fire, and I would give anything to lie in my bed once more. The first month after the fire was the worst time of my life, but I kept myself from insanity by throwing myself into my work as an environmental activist. As I immersed myself in my activism and research, I was gripped by a realization that propelled me into a deeper sense of urgency: global warming might have been responsible for the extreme weather that destroyed my home. I knew that rising global temperatures cause an increase in the frequency and intensity of storms. I wondered: is the lightning associated with these storms also a result of climate change? The answer is yes. According to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, there will be an “approximate 5-6 percent change in global lightning frequencies for every 1 degree Celsius global warming/cooling.” The Earth has already warmed .8 degrees Celsius in the past century, and Maine has warmed 1 degree Celsius since 1970. The average number of lightning strikes per thunderstorm in my county is 100. The night my house burned down, there were 217 recorded strikes. Alarmingly, the frequency of extreme storms in Maine has increased 70 percent in the past 60 years.
No one can say for sure that global warming was responsible for the fire. But these and other data suggest that what happened to my home was not random. This pattern of extreme weather is seen in Maine, the United States, and throughout the world. Drought in the U.S. over the summer caused world food prices to increase 10 percent. West Nile Virus, created by larger mosquito populations thriving in warm weather, was rampant in Texas. The worst wildfires in decades spread across Colorado, fed by a heat wave and drought. Extreme weather conditions have destroyed homes and resulted in habitat destruction and people dying. Climate scientists agree that, in the coming years, we will confront rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and extreme weather. Global warming affects not only polar bears, but also every single human on this planet. As NASA climatologist James E. Hansen wrote this summer: “For the extreme hot weather of the recent past, there is virtually no explanation other than climate change.” Other extreme weather events are now being conclusively linked to climate change.
Our generation is the first to see the devastating effects of global warming. The responsibility to mitigate climatic upheavals, change human behavior, and save our world will fall to us. What’s more—we will be defined by our response to these new realities. If past generations had the power to alter the global climate system for the worse, then our generation must rally to change it for the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Puritanism,” defined the satirist-scholar Henry Mencken, “is the haunting belief that somewhere someone is happier than you.” We may have abandoned our founders’ captain hats and fetish for witchcraft, but destructive spite is alive and well at Harvard today.  We see it in recent tut-tutting as record numbers rush Greek organizations; in the characterization of final clubs as a cross between Mitt Romney’s rumpus room and an Eastern European brothel; in the description of the Crimson Key as “the perfect embodiment of pernicious social elitism” and the Hasty Pudding Club as “a once-secret society premised on ad-hoc partying.” Believe this, and you’d think modern Harvard students are most afraid that somewhere someone is having more fun than they are.
Social space is the fixation of this campus. Talked, written and griped over, everyone from the Dems to the Dins must have an on-record grievance about their lack of accommodation. Such a sustained groundswell of dissatisfaction—the naive might have assumed—would have resulted in solutions long ago. Yet, the discussion goes on. Why? Because too often our energy is wasted in pointless invective against what social provision does exist rather than spent in constructive dialogue.
If every selective social organization disbanded itself today, nobody’s social life would be improved tomorrow. Instead, for some, quite the opposite would happen. Nonetheless, it is clear that an incurably aggrieved minority would prefer that everyone have nothing than some have something. To achieve this they resort, consciously or unconsciously, to offensively reckless stereotyping. It is not right that by the mere merit of joining a final club or fraternity, our male colleagues should be harangued as racist, homophobic, sexually predatory, or worse. Their female counterparts are patronizingly depicted as clinging to the coat tails of imagined social androcentricity.
Are final clubs anti-women or sororities anti-men? Only in so much as these are structural aspects of their nature. To accuse them so is like accusing Harvard of being anti the unintelligent. Not a writer? This paper, laudable mouthpiece for the socially dissatisfied, nonetheless probably did not invite you to any of their closed-door parties recently either, despite possessing its own private social space. Are the qualities by which one enters a selective social organization like the Hasty Pudding Club any more arbitrarily assigned or gauged than those used to enter selective organizations based on “talent” such as the Signet or the Advocate? To say that all members of selective social organizations share your choice negative quality is as fallacious as saying that all Harvard students are elitists because our admission rate is 6.2 percent.
Students that criticize their peers for networking and social advancement ignore the fact that a Harvard education is an exercise in these very activities. By striving to be selected into the exclusive ranks of Harvard ahead of many other, perhaps equally deserving people, we are all guilty of no greater or lesser a sin than those who choose to join selective social organizations. They are like expressions of the human desire to get ahead and belong. Being thwarted in that desire is unpleasant, but it is the known risk in a game to which we have already all signed up.
It is also, in itself, an education. Life is unfair—this is one the most annoying, yet useful, of parental lessons. All but the least self-aware members of selective organizations realize their inclusion in those societies as opposed to anyone else’s is arbitrary. All but the least self-aware non-members should realize that their absence is similarly capricious. “If you constantly compare yourself with others,” warns Ehrmann’s “Desiderata,” “you will become vain and bitter, for always are there greater and lesser people than yourself.” Regardless of what clubs we were in at Harvard, all of us are ahead of the majority of people.
Some may think me a quisling, not being a member of any of the more controversial social organizations, but I know the twilight spaces of discomfort that our social status quo engenders well enough. At one point we all encounter the necessitated fishing for invitations, the anxiety of exclusion, and the tacit barriers between friends that our system creates. But we cannot be crabs in a bucket, clawing each other down. We should not overflow with vanity and bitterness, hypocritically attacking our peers for making difficult decisions we would probably make in their place anyway. Instead, critics of the social status quo should focus their energy on positive action and pressuring the administration, particularly on its prohibitive policies on alcohol and the languid schemes of the Office of Student Life.
In ten years’ time, whatever we do, this will matter little. In or out, the best lesson we can learn from Harvard’s broken social scene is the value of the clubs of privilege to which we already all belong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One student group at Harvard demands a lot more than a comp. To join Black Diamond Capital Investors, a student-run investing club at Harvard, prospective members must buy in at least $1,000.
“Black Diamond is all about taking investments to the next level,” said Patrick M. Colangelo ’14, who founded the club last semester. He said that the mandatory minimum investment exists to ensure member engagement in the group, which is limited to 25 participants.
"We select experienced finance students who are willing to put up the minimum capital contribution because we seek partners who will be vested in the operations and performance of the fund," Colangelo said. "It really gets the most out of our partners.”
Member Arash Alidoust ’13 said he believes the buy-in is critical to the success of Black Diamond, which claims to be Harvard’s largest private growth fund. “It makes you much more concerned and much more innovative,” Alidoust said. “Black Diamond becomes part of your life.”
Members said that Black Diamond’s investment strategy differs significantly from that of other financial groups on campus. Like the hedge funds it emulates, Black Diamond is a riskier investment than some of its peer groups, a risk which members hope will be rewarded. Colangelo said that the organization is aiming for a 30 percent return on its investment.
The 25 members each invest up to $20,000 into the club. These members make up the general partnership, which makes joint decisions on investment strategies and shares equally both the rewards and the losses. In the past week, Black Diamond has sent emails inviting students to seek a spot in the group over several finance-oriented listservs, the first time that the group has solicited applications rather than recruiting individual members by referral.
The email said that interested students should submit their resumes and expect an interview.
In addition to its general partners, Black Diamond also boasts an advisory board consisting of professionals in the business and academic world.
While Paul H. Farber ’13, a member, recognized that the minimum buy-in requirement might prevent some from joining the club, he said that there are many other opportunities for students to get involved in investment on campus.
Colangelo said he started the club in order to bring together people from a wide variety of backgrounds interested in finance.
“What Black Diamond has been created for is for investors who have a little bit of experience, joining a group of other experienced individuals who really want to do something different,” Colangelo said.
Alidoust said that the strength and diversity of Black Diamond’s team of investors allows the club to break out of the typical “framework” of investing.
“We encourage innovation and new ideas about investing, rather than just sticking with the old ideas,” he said.
Members stressed that as much as Black Diamond is focused on earning money, it also aims to educate its members.
“Our number one priority is to create an environment where people can learn and are engaged,”  said Farber.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents more than 4,600 non-faculty employees, delivered signed posters and letters on Thursday to the offices of 34 administrators regarding the union’s months-long contract negotiation with the University.
Recipients included deans across the University and members of the University’s central administration, such as President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, and other vice presidents.
The letter expressed disappointment in the University’s positions on health care and salary increases and accused Harvard of taking a “narrow and negative stance” in the negotiations that have dragged on since June. The message closed by asking recipients to “please use the powers of your office to steer the negotiations in a more constructive direction.”
The union also gave administrators large posters bearing 3,600 signatures and an accompanying letter. Roughly 3,000 of the signatures came from HUCTW members, while the remaining 600 belonged to non-union “exempt” workers on campus, students, and other supporters.
The contract that currently governs the relationship between the University and union members expired on June 30, but because negotiators could not reach a deal, the old contract will remain in effect until it can be replaced. HUCTW released an open letter in July that expressed concerns similar to those raised in this week’s letter.
HUCTW organizer Donene M. Williams, a member of the union’s negotiating team, said that the union was proud of the number of signatures on the poster and that she hoped the show of support would push negotiations in a productive direction.
“Each of those [signatures] represented a conversation we had with a worker,” said Williams, a former president and treasurer of HUCTW. “Each of the people who signed it really meant it.”
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger has said that the 1992 contract negotiation, one of the longest processes in recent memory, lasted about six months. Jaeger could not be reached for comment for this article.
Williams said that the recipients of the statement were people who could have a “moral influence” on the University.
Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin said after receiving the letter, “We recognize that the men and women who belong to the HUCTW are key contributors to the University’s mission and we are committed to reaching an agreement that will continue to provide them with fair and equitable wages and benefits.”
HUCTW member Paul A. Gregoire, a media services technician at Harvard Law School and member of the delegation dispatched to Law School deans, said that he was hopeful that the statement would help move negotiations toward a conclusion.“
The University administration has not been very positive in response, so we’re hoping this will cause an upgrade in consciousness amongst the administration so that they realize that they’re dealing with a mass of people, not just a few people around a [negotiating] table.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The merits and faults of laws which will require voters in several states to present photo IDs at the polls in November were discussed in a lively debate between four experts at the Institute of Politics.
The panelists at the Thursday evening event were Jennie Bowser, senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures; John H. Fund, senior editor of The American Spectator; Harvard Kennedy School professor Alex Keyssar ’69; and Tova A. Wang, fellow at Demos and The Century Foundation.
IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, who moderated the event, kicked off the discussion by remarking that the issue at hand was particularly tied to the approaching 2012 presidential election. “Back in the 2000 election, we wouldn’t be having this type of discussion,” he said.
Bowser agreed, remarking that this election cycle has already seen an unusually high “politicization of elections in state legislatures,” which pass voter ID laws in the hopes of deterring groups of voters unlikely to pick their preferred candidates, in her view.
Wang said that voter ID laws could disenfranchise voters, particularly the poor, elderly, and minorities, who are less likely to have identification. All those groups commonly vote for Democrats.“
The partisan divide couldn’t possibly be starker,” Bowser said.
Panelists disagreed about whether voter fraud is a serious issue. Wang said that voter impersonation fraud is “virtually nonexistent,” and that measures like ID requirements to combat it were unnecessary.
“Voting is a right, not a privilege,” Wang said. “You have politicians choosing the electorate rather than the electorate choosing the politicians.”
Fund, on the other hand, gave several examples of what he considered serious incidents of voter fraud. He said that in some states, for example, fraudulent voters have cast ballots under the names of deceased people.“
I respect the dead,” Fund said. “But I do not believe in representation without respiration.”
On a couple occasions, Wang and Fund raised their voices and interrupted each other when their disagreement became especially vehement.“
John [Fund] has an amazing way of making things seem reasonable,” Wang said.“
Because they are,” Fund replied.“
Because they’re not,” Wang said, to applause.
Despite ideological differences, panel members agreed that the voting system could use significant improvement.
IOP Forum Committee Chairman Ibrahim A. Khan ’14 said the event was the first in a series of four discussions on controversial political topics to be held before Election Day. Khan said that the dispute over voter ID laws first caught the Forum organizers’ attention when it came up during the Black Policy Conference at the Kennedy School last spring.“
We figured it’s probably a good idea to go into the idea more,” Khan said.
Zachary D. Herring ’13, who attended the event and asked a question of the panel members, also said that despite the tension, he thought the debate was productive.

Family, friends, and Harvard community members came together to celebrate the life of Cote K. Laramie ’14 at a service full of music and poetry in Memorial Church on Thursday night, a week after he died at his home in Pembroke, N.H.
Bookended by the resonating tones of a church organ, the service alternated between spoken addresses and musical selections—a fitting tribute to Laramie’s passion for both poetry and music.“
Cote left an indelible mark on our souls,” said his brother Keith Dobbins before reading a poem written by Laramie entitled “Everything Changes.” Dobbins, speaking of his sibling’s legacy, expressed gratitude for the many kind messages and memories shared by the attendees.“
I always looked up to him, both literally and figuratively,” he said in a moment of lightness, referring to his younger brother’s six-foot, three-inch stature. “To see the person he had become through your eyes will forever inspire me.”
Laramie was also an inspiration to many faculty members, said Harvard Medical School professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis, who told those present that he had received messages from several professors who had taught Laramie describing him as a uniquely engaged student. Christakis added that Laramie’s intellect did not curb his good humor. When he recalled during the service that Laramie had called Co-Master Erika L. Christakis a “badass” for taking up boxing, the church filled with laughter—a frequent occurrence as others shared their own memories of Laramie’s joyful personality.
The service included tributes from Laramie’s friends across the University.  Christine E. Ashton ’13 and others both in and out of Pforzheimer made colorful paper cranes that adorned the end of each of the front pews. Laramie’s freshman entrywaymates from Wigglesworth H helped usher the service, while the Harvard Glee Club—of which Laramie was a member—sang two pieces, including a moving rendition of Robert Frost’s “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,” arranged by Randall Thompson ’20. Rainer A. Crosett ’14, Julia L. Glenn ’11-’12, Ryan A. Murphy ’14, and Jacob R. Shack ’14 also performed a string quartet.
Hilton R. Simmet ’14, Laramie’s freshman roommate and blockmate, related his own journey of getting to know the young man who would become his best friend, emphasizing Laramie’s wisdom, curiosity, and goodness.
Speaking of the last morning that they spent together over the summer, Simmet shared a message Laramie told him then: “You can’t fix people, but you can listen to them,” Laramie had said. “The most important thing you can do is give yourself time.”
The speakers acknowledged the many unanswered questions raised by Laramie’s suicide for his friends and family.“
His sensitivity and artistic talents and passion for language were not only a gift—to him and to others–but sometimes, truly, an unbearable burden,” Christakis said, quoting from a blog post written by his wife about Laramie. “
No training in the world, no education, is a match for the human condition,” he added as an afterthought.
Mark D. W. Edington, executive director of the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory, where Laramie worked over the summer, challenged the congregation to give meaning to its sorrow by striving for the same openness and innocent daring that Laramie embodied—and by rethinking the “intellectual combat” with which Harvard is often charged.“
We need to find the courage to protect some of our capacity for wonder…to allow ourselves the liberty of being captivated by others,” he said, echoing the words he had used to describe Laramie.
Attendees filed out of Memorial Church from the front entrance, their procession accompanied by 20 tolls of the Memorial Church bells to mark Laramie’s age.
The service was followed by a reception in the Barker Center, where friends and family shared stories and refreshments, viewed a slideshow of photographs of Laramie, and wrote messages for a scrapbook to be sent to his family.
Dale R. Riley, a guard in the Barker Center, was proud to be a part of the reception—Laramie waved at him every day when he walked through the Barker Center.“
Everyone is shocked I know Cote,” he said. “But of course I knew him. He made me very happy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“Run.” That’s the message to women in a newly released video featuring Undergraduate Council Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13.
The video, posted on the Harvard College Women’s Center’s YouTube channel, came three days prior to the deadline for submitting declarations of candidacy.
Though the number of women on the UC, a persistent topic of concern, has increased in recent years, female representatives still make up less than 40 percent of the Council.
“I think that all Harvard students have the capacity to run for the UC,” says Yalamanchi in the minute-long video. “I think it’s just realizing that your perspective is valuable to student government here.”
Last fall, the UC released a report on gender parity that revealed only 35 percent of UC representatives were female, up from fall 2010 statistics, when women numbered only 25 percent.
The report proposed initiatives to equalize the gender balance, including working to achieve a level gender ratio within specific UC committees and reaching out to potential candidates at the Women’s Center.
Current UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13, co-author of the report, said he hopes to encourage dialogue about gender barriers.
“The UC is supposed to be a representative student government,” said Bicknell. “If we have such a large gender gap–last year 35 percent female–then that is not really reflective of the student body.”
Yalamanchi shared a similar sentiment as she reflected on the video and her path into student government.
“Women are approximately 50 percent of the College and provide a really valuable perspective for funding and advocacy at Harvard,” she said. “A female UC president encouraged me to run when I was a freshman, and I want to do the same for other women on campus.”
In conjunction with the Women’s Center, the UC has made other efforts to reach out to undergraduate women aside from this week’s video. The Council tailored all three of its election workshops to addressing issues facing female candidates, and a new report on gender and leadership is due out this year, according to Bicknell. Applicants of all genders need to submit their candidate declaration by Friday at noon. More information can be found on the UC’s website.
“Women provide a really useful perspective on the UC,” Yalamanchi said at the end of the video. “I encourage all of you to run.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jay Herlihy will be the new Dean of Finance for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences as of Sept. 26, according to an email sent to members of FAS Friday morning.
His appointment fills a nearly four-month long void in the school's administrative ranks created by the departure of former FAS Associate Dean for Finance Eric Kopstain for a position at Vanderbilt University this May.
Harvard undertook a national search to find Kopstain’s replacement, but ultimately chose a candidate from within the University. Herlihy has served as the Associate Dean for Finance at the Graduate School of Education since 2009, after first joining Harvard as a GSE administrator in 2005.
"[Herlihy's] deep understanding of Harvard’s culture and experience with Harvard’s capital planning process give him the experience necessary to manage FAS finances across all our divisions, departments, centers and offices," wrote Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, who sent out the announcement Friday morning to faculty, administrators, and staff in FAS. "In addition to working to manage the day-to-day finances of the GSE, Jay played a key role in assisting the school’s master- and strategic-planning operations.”
In the last six years the GSE doubled its financial budget to support new degree programs financial aid, and growing research programs, according to Kirwan.
GSE Financial Operations Manager Evelyn Wong, who worked with Herlihy closely while he was director of financial planning and administration at GSE from 2006 to 2008, said he will be sorely missed in the finance office at the GSE.
She cited his ability to carry the GSE through the financial crisis and the central role Herlihy played in piloting the Harvard University Budgeting System—a complete overhaul of the budgeting process—as two of his most important contributions.
“I have certainly learned a great deal from him,” she said. “He’s going to be someone that will work collectively and openly with his new unit in FAS—he’s going to be a tremendous asset.”
Herlihy, who holds a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Tufts University, and both a Master's in accounting and MBA from Northwestern, has worked in both higher education and industry prior to coming to Harvard. Starting in 1996, he took charge of a $250 million capital plan at Tufts University and in 2000, he was picked to be Director of Administration and Finance of the Fletcher School at Tufts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The four-cone drill was a staple of senior Nnamdi Obukwelu’s offseason workout regimen. Standing in the middle of four equidistant cones, Obukwelu would dash to each at the command of his coach. A test of agility, the drill required Obukwelu to accelerate, stop on a dime, change direction to come back to the center, and then do it all again.
In the heat of Harvard Stadium, the drill could be tough, but Obukwelu and his fellow defensive linemen are well-versed at changing course after facing challenges for much of their Harvard careers.
During Obukwelu’s freshman year, the D-line finished second in the Ivy League in sacks, led by Josue Ortiz ’11. But the team lost 17-7 to Penn and finished second in the Ancient Eight. In 2010, Ortiz was even better, leading the league in tackles for a loss, but that still wasn’t enough to bring down the Quakers, who claimed a second straight Ivy crown.
With the unit growing stronger as Ortiz entered his final year, Carlton Hall, the assistant coach charged with preparing the defensive line, left Cambridge for another job, and Dwayne Wilmot came from Maine to fill the gap. The linemen pivoted and accelerated faster than ever, emerging as a dominant force in 2011.
The squad held opponents to an average of 90 yards on the ground and brought down opposing quarterbacks a league-high 28 times. Paired with a dominant offense, the Crimson went undefeated in league play to claim its first crown in three years.
Now, Obukwelu and company have to adjust again after losing two leaders. The first loss was the expected graduation of Ortiz, the leader of the line and the 2011 Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year.
“He came up huge every game,” Obukwelu says. “He was the anchor for the D-line.”
More than his play on the field, Ortiz’s drive in the offseason will be missed.
“Replacing a guy like Josue is definitely tough,” fifth-year senior John Lyon says. “One of the bigger things that you pick up from a guy like that is the type of attitude he had. Working out with him, doing extra lifts, he definitely pushed me, and I’m sure he pushed a lot of guys on the defensive line to work harder.”
While no one is expected to produce as Ortiz did during his Crimson career, Harvard coach Tim Murphy thinks that Obukwelu has the ability to take over as the centerpiece of a deep defensive line.
“I think it’s [going to be] a big year for Nnamdi Obukwelu,” Murphy says. “I think talent-wise, Nnamdi is the most talented defensive lineman we’ve recruited since we’ve been here. If he can take the next step, I think he could be a dominating player along the Josue Ortiz lines.”
While the squad was preparing to move on without Ortiz, the defensive line’s second loss came as a surprise. After a successful year at the helm, Wilmot, with three other former Harvard coaches, left in January to coach at Yale.
“I’m not trying to replace them, no different than Nnamdi is trying to place Josue,” says new defensive line coach Michael Horan, the Crimson’s third coach in three years. “I’m just trying to find my own style.”
Instead of bringing someone in from another school to fill the role again, Murphy chose to promote Horan, who has been on the Harvard staff for three years, in the hope of keeping the defensive line at the same level of play as a season ago.
“I feel as though the players didn’t want another new face,” Horan says. “For Coach Murphy to give me this amazing opportunity, I was very grateful, but the consensus along the D-line was that the players were glad Coach Murphy made the decision he made.”
Horan will coach an experienced line that includes eight seniors that have been in Cambridge as long as he has.
Despite the wealth of veteran leadership, two younger players may see a bigger role in the pass rush this season, including junior Jack Dittmer.
“He’s a natural pass rusher,” Horan says of Dittmer. “He’s got a knack to get to the QB.”
Dittmer has been a “dominating presence in the preseason,” according to Murphy.
Another end to watch out for is sophomore Zach Hodges. Hodges saw significant playing time as a freshman and was named second-team All-Ivy this preseason.
Inside, Obukwelu will be joined by less proven talent, including Nnamdi’s younger brother, sophomore Obum Obukwelu. The Crimson’s inexperience on the interior has increased the importance of the elder Obukwelu’s conditioning, as Murphy expects him to be on the field for up to 50 plays a game. That was one motivation for Nnamdi Obukwelu to work even harder this offseason, adding weight and improving his agility.
After an offseason of running from cone to cone, dealing with adversity and pushing to improve, Obukwelu hopes he’s gotten back to the center of the cones again, the level of play the D-line was competing at in the final games of last season.
“Guys have the mentality that we can beat what we did last year if we put the work in,” Obukwelu says. “We will have to wait and see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For senior Colton Chapple, it has been a slow rise to the top. Now in his fourth and final season, he finally has his starting job at quarterback.
In 2010, Chapple came in as the team’s third-string option, appearing in just a few games after two quarterbacks above him on the depth chart went down with injuries.
In 2011, he filled in as a substitute again and excelled. Against Cornell in his third week as a starter, Chapple became just the second Harvard quarterback to ever pass for over 400 yards in a single game. But Chapple wasn’t finished; the following week against Bucknell, he tossed five touchdowns in just over a half, tying a program record that was over a half century old.
But despite Chapple’s throwing eight touchdowns in six quarters, fifth-year senior Collier Winters ’11 started the last five games of the season after returning from injury, and the Crimson finished off a perfect year in conference play and took the league title.
In 2012, the job is all Chapple’s, and he now has a chance to lead the Ancient Eight’s preseason favorite to a second consecutive Ivy League title.
But Chapple’s journey to Cambridge, to Harvard Stadium, and ultimately to the starting job, dates back to the time when he was eight years old, first picking up a football with his brothers and his father as the coach.
Throughout his childhood, Chapple—the second of four boys in the family—worked with his three brothers and their father on drills, and Colton followed in his older brother’s footsteps by playing in high school.
Chapple says he was a good student in high school who wanted to play football in college. But Harvard was not on his radar until his senior year.
“To be honest, I never thought I’d end up here,” Chapple says. “I was a pretty good student, but the H-word was just, ‘Whoa. There’s no way. This isn’t the place for me.’”
But with the opportunity in front of him, Chapple visited Harvard in November 2008, watching The Game and meeting with his brother’s high school teammate who played for Harvard at the time. The experiences sold him on the school, and he joined Harvard football as a freshman the following fall.
Slowly over the course of his college career, he has worked his way up the quarterback depth chart. But even as the third-stringer as a sophomore and the back-up as a junior, he has already started almost a full season’s worth of games.
“Any time you have a quarterback that is [6-1] as a starter, you’re really happy,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “But it’s really a big difference being the starter as opposed to the backup who’s waiting for the other guy to come back.”
Despite having thrown just one pass in three games played his freshman year, Chapple was thrust into the starting role for three games during his sophomore season after Winters and second-stringer Andrew Hatch both went down.
Looking back now, Chapple says, it was valuable—even if it’s painful to watch.
“I go back and watch film of myself sophomore year, and I really just gawk at some of the decisions I made, some of the throws I made,” Chapple says. “I feel like it was very uncharacteristic of me.”
Just one year later, Chapple stepped in behind center once again after Winters went down. Chapple says he was unhappy with his preseason performance, but he had the chance to start against Brown in just the second game of the year under the lights at home.
To deal with pre-game jitters, Chapple remembers Murphy stepping in.
“I remember meeting with Coach Murphy before the Brown game, and he said two of the things that have always stuck with me,” Chapple recalls. “With all the stress of performing, he just said, ‘Relax. Football’s fun.’”
As he got ready to make his first start of the year, Chapple remembers one other line from Murphy: “It sure as hell beats sitting on the bench.”
A few weeks later, of course, he was doing just that despite two historic performances in his four games under center. Chapple returned to the bench when Winters recovered, and although he called the decision “disappointing and frustrating,” he understood it.
But there’s no longer any doubt who the team’s quarterback in 2012 will be, and Chapple will have to prove—with the support of the receiving corps and the offensive line—that he can consistently put up the offensive numbers he managed against Cornell and Bucknell last season.
“Kids believe in him,” Murphy says. “He’s very natural.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team unleashed one of its most dominant performances in program history in 2011, rolling unscathed through league play en route to an Ivy League title. In the process, the Crimson scored 374 points, tops for any Harvard team in the modern era.
Unsurprisingly, the Crimson enters the   2012 season as the heavy favorite to repeat. And that begs the question: Will 2012 be an encore performance?
“Every team is different,” senior quarterback Colton Chapple says. “Coach Murphy reminds us of that every year at the first team meeting: ‘The team of 2011 is dead and gone. Those seniors have graduated. What are you guys going to do?’”
Some of those departed seniors played critical roles in last year’s Ivy title run. The team must grapple with losses of All-Ivy players such as quarterback Collier Winters ’11, linebacker Alex Gedeon ‘12, and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Josue Ortiz ’11.
Players on the team have also said that the Crimson is expecting to lose at least one projected major contributor who was implicated in the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
But Harvard returns many pieces from its championship team a season ago, and Crimson coach Tim Murphy told the Boston Herald that “all 24 projected starters coming out of spring ball are in good academic standing, healthy, and ready to go on Saturday.”
Chapple will lead the offense in 2012 after filling in much of last season following Winters’ injury in the first week. In his time behind center in 2011, the relatively unheralded Chapple led the Crimson to four straight wins and reeled off perhaps the best two-game stretch of any Harvard quarterback in history.
And as he did last season, Chapple will have two weapons at his disposal at tight end: senior Kyle Juszczyk, a preseason All-American, and junior Cam Brate. Opposing defenses struggled all season to handle the duo, which combined for 14 touchdown catches.
“They’re as good as we’re going to get at this level,” Murphy says. “I think they’re both legitimate NFL prospects.”
In the backfield, Chapple will be joined by a familiar face in senior running back Treavor Scales, who ran for a team-best 816 yards a season ago. Senior Rich Zajeski and freshman Paul Stanton are also expected to see time at the position. According to Murphy, sophomore Zach Boden is out with a short-term injury.
At wide receiver, juniors Andrew Berg and Ricky Zorn—neither of whom started a year ago—fill in following the graduation of Chris Lorditch ’11, Adam Chrissis ’12, and Alex Sarkisian ’12. But according to teammates, neither Berg nor Zorn has missed a beat.
“Some might critique them that they’re not the prototypical 6’3”, 6’4” wide receivers that we’ve had in the past, but for them, it doesn’t matter,” Chapple says. “They’ll go get any ball. They both are extremely athletic, and they’re not afraid to go across the middle, which is something I love [in] wide receivers.”
According to Murphy, junior Matt Brown  has a shoulder injury and therefore will not be a factor for most of this season. In the spring, Murphy had expected Brown—who is also a member of the men’s basketball team—to play a key role offensively.
On the defensive side, senior Nnamdi Obukwelu and fifth-year senior John Lyon—both of whom received preseason All-Ivy nods—led a defensive line that dominated the Ivy League a season ago. In 2011, the Crimson allowed just 89.7 rushing yards per game, nearly 25 percent less than the second-best squad.
The biggest question marks defensively arise in the secondary. Perhaps the team’s biggest liability in the 2011 season, this year’s defensive backs lack much game-day experience.
“Because so few of them have played in varsity games, other than let’s say three guys, we’ll see,” Murphy says. “We’ll be tested early.”
One source for optimism, though, is sophomore Norman Hayes, who shores up the thin cornerback position.
“He’s the natural,” Murphy says of Hayes. “Tough, physical, instinctive, fast—faster than we thought.  And the kid can really play right now. He’s pushing [seniors Brian Owusu and D.J. Monroe] for a starting position.”
No Ivy League player has the ability to exploit the secondary’s potential vulnerabilities more than Cornell junior quarterback Jeff Mathews. Last year’s Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year, the Big Red gunslinger threw for 3,412 yards, including over 500 yards in each of the season’s final two contests.
“If he stays on the arc that he’s on, he’s not only going to get drafted, he’s going to go in the first three rounds,” Murphy says. “He’s special…a once-every-20-year quarterback in this league.”
Despite a decade of relative futility, the Mathews-led Cornell squad appears to be Harvard’s biggest threat to its campaign to repeat as Ivy champs. A year ago, the Big Red came closer than any of its Ancient Eight counterparts to knocking off the Crimson, and Harvard escaped Ithaca, N.Y., with a narrow 41-31 victory.
Before the Crimson and Cornell square off at Harvard Stadium on Oct. 6, the Crimson’s first league test will come on Sept. 22 in a tough contest at Brown. In that rivalry, the home team has won the last five times.
“That night game down in Providence, I know they get really jacked up whenever we play them, and they’re a really physical [team],” senior center Jack Holuba says.
After taking on Cornell, the Crimson plays the weakest portion of its Ivy schedule: at Princeton, which is pegged to finish last in most Ivy League polls, at Dartmouth, and against Columbia on Nov. 3 at home.
The Crimson heads to Philadelphia to meet Penn on Nov. 10, a matchup that could potentially decide what figures to be a three-team race for the Ivy crown between Harvard, Cornell, and the Quakers. Plagued by inexperience and youth a year ago, Penn returns a tougher team in 2012, led for the third straight campaign by senior quarterback Billy Ragone.
But for many players, the season’s biggest contest comes a week later against Yale. This year’s matchup has meaning beyond the history of The Game, which Harvard won in a 45-7 rout in 2011. The flight to Yale of four Crimson coaches following last season, including current Bulldogs head coach Tony Reno, amplifies the emotions surrounding one of the most storied rivalries in college football.
“It’s not only The Game now,” Chapple says. “It’s a little personal.... Ever since we heard that [the coaches were leaving for Yale] in January, we’ve had that game circled.”
“[We’re] hearing from some of the Yale players that it’s like night and day for their program...which should be good,” Holuba adds. “It was a little boring last year in New Haven.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 1912 season was a revolutionary one for college football.  A century ago, the NCAA implemented a number of rule changes to the then-77-school league that would change the game forever, ushering in the modern era of America’s most popular sport.
For the first time, teams were given four downs instead of three; the value of touchdowns was increased from five points to six; and the field was reduced from 110 to 100 yards, with two end zones of ten yards added instead. Among smaller changes, kickoffs were made from the 40-yard line rather than midfield, the ball was placed at the 20 rather than the 25 following touchbacks, teams were given much more leeway to use the forward pass, and the onside kick was abolished.
The new rules were implemented on Feb. 3, 1912 by a football rules committee composed of Harvard head coach Percy D. Haughton, Class of 1899, Yale’s Walter Camp, and Penn’s W.N. Morice. According to The Crimson, the changes were intended to “more nearly equalize the attacking and defensive powers.”
“During the past season it developed that if a team could not gain its ten yards in two downs it preferred to trust to the individual ability of a punter, rather than to risk losing the ball entirely,” the newspaper explained. “The change which gives a team four downs to make ten yards is expected to strengthen the offense.” The reasoning provided for the ban on onside kicks was their “generally unsatisfactory nature, and the possibility of injuries resulting from the efforts to recover the bounding ball.”
Ten months later, the first season under the new rules came to an end with Haughton’s Crimson at the top of the college football world. Harvard dominated its schedule and finished the year 9-0—its first of three straight unbeaten seasons—and earned its sixth national championship.
The story of how the team got to that point involves more than the coach who had been a two-time first-team All-American at defensive tackle for the Crimson from 1896 to 1899. It also encompasses a defensive end who would later shun Connie Mack, a fullback who found the game “not quite rough enough,” two interior linemen who would later become a chemist and a war hero, and one of the best drop-kickers in history.
TRAINING DAY
A few months after the new rules had been put in place, Haughton began preparations for Harvard’s season opener against Maine, which would take place at the nine-year-old Harvard Stadium on Sept. 28. Coming off a 6-2-1 season in 1911, the Crimson practiced for just two weeks upon arriving at school. During those practices, according to The Crimson, “shifting teams of men on the first squad were put against one another for practice in running through signals and formations against a defence [sic].”
Defensive end Samuel Felton and fullback Huntington “Tack” Hardwick battled against each other for the punter job, averaging 40 yards per punt in practice with a few 50-yard kicks as well.  A year prior, Felton had been one of the leaders of a Crimson squad that had opened the season 5-0, outscoring opponents 72-6 over that stretch. But the then-junior was seriously injured in that fifth game against Brown after being kicked in the side and developing a blood clot. Following the injury, the team was never the same and went 1-2-1 down the stretch. But with a new season on the horizon, The Crimson noted Felton’s recovery, stating that his “work in all departments of the game is excellent and it is fortunate that he will be able to play the entire season.”
The 174-pound Hardwick was known for his blocking skills. One reporter would later describe him as “perhaps the hardest blocker American football has ever known. A vicious, tireless interferer, Hardwick was never happy as long as a single enemy remained standing.” Sportswriter Grantland Rice would later deem the sophomore “the spirit of football,” describing him as “a big, fine-looking aristocrat from blue-blood stock,” who “loved combat—body contact at crushing force.”
Robert Storer lined up alongside Felton at defensive tackle. An upperclassman who had also played center the year before, Storer was well known for his special teams prowess, notably his ability to “[get] down the field under punts with the ends and [make] a sure tackle of the runner,” according to The Crimson.
As the team continued to prepare for the Black Bears, Haughton emphasized both field goal kicking and the newly important forward pass. 5’8” quarterback H.B. Gardener quickly began generating chemistry by throwing 20-yard passes to teammates J.A. Milholland and Albert Weatherhead.
Behind Gardener was halfback Charles Brickley, also a talented drop-kicker who had captained the freshman squad a year prior. Before arriving at school, Brickley had finished ninth in the triple jump at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm.  Frederick Bradlee also played halfback while Hardwick served as the fullback. “All of these men are heavy and fast, and are developing into sure ground gainers,” The Crimson wrote.
Members of the offensive line included Gerard Driscoll, a newcomer to the team who had been “showing up very well” during practices, the 185-pound Derrick Parmenter—described as “fast in charging”—at center, sophomore Stanley Pennock at right guard, and Weatherford, another sophomore, at right tackle. Pennock had played on the freshman team the year prior, and to that point, according to The Crimson, he had “yet to prove his value on the first eleven, though his work in practice has been good.”
THE GAMES BEGIN
Once the practices were complete, opening day finally arrived. Maine came to Cambridge fresh off a 38-0 defeat of Fort McKinley a week earlier, and the Black Bears, according to The Crimson, were “prepared to give the University a hard rub.”
The team Harvard put on the field for its opener was an inexperienced one, with a group of players that The Crimson stated “as a whole have had little experience in University football.”  Following the graduation of All-Americans such as end L.D. Smith and guard Bob Fisher, both Class of 1912, half of the Crimson’s starting lineup came from the previous year’s freshman team.
Despite its youth—which may have led to what The Crimson called a “distinct lack of team-play” in its first game—Harvard was able to shut out Maine, 7-0. Brickley scored the team’s only touchdown on an early 17-yard run. After bringing the ball to the Crimson 20, the Black Bears had the chance to tie the game on its next drive. On fourth down, Maine ran a fake field goal, but a pass missed a wide-open receiver in the end zone—instead hitting the crossbar directly in front of him—thus ending the Black Bears’ best threat.
Following a week of “hard scrimmages,” Harvard’s offense was much more in sync, as the Crimson topped Holy Cross, 19-0, in a contest dominated by the ground game. Harvard opened with 10 consecutive rushes that led to a Brickley score. Hardwick was featured in the second period, and a 35-yard gain helped set up his first touchdown of the afternoon. Before the period was over, Brickley had added his second score, and in the subsequent half, Harvard put in its bench players, who according to The Crimson “were weaker [than the starters] but far from bad.” Though Holy Cross made it down to the Crimson 12, the Harvard reserves successively forced the Crusaders’ running backs into a combined 15 yards in losses to preserve the shutout.
Reporting on the game the following Monday, the paper stated that Harvard “showed two things clearly; namely, that the changes in the rules which have been the cause of a good deal of skepticism among followers of football have not spoiled the game, and that the Harvard squad has on it men who may be depended upon to turn out a team well up to the standard.”
The Crimson cruised to another win on October 12, topping Williams 26-3. The Ephs’ points—the first of the season against Harvard—came as a result of what The Crimson called a “splendid” succession of forward passes in the second quarter. The following weekend, Harvard dominated Amherst, steamrolling to a 46-0 victory. The shutout came despite the absence of Wendell—who had suffered a cut behind his ear in practice that week—as Hardwick picked up the slack with a 60-yard touchdown run.
With its captain back, the Crimson played its first future Ivy League foe, Brown, on Oct. 26. The Bears—who, according to The Crimson came into the game outweighing Harvard 179 to 175 pounds on average—contained a backfield “composed of the hardest of line plungers.” But despite their size, the Bears were no match for Harvard, which cruised to a 36-10 victory. The successive wins to that point led The Crimson to note that “the early season games have conclusively proved that the 1912 team is well up to the average of Harvard football teams of former years.”
A DATE WITH THE PRINCE
As the calendar turned to November, Harvard was faced with its biggest challenge yet—the defending national champion and, to that point, undefeated Princeton, whom the Crimson had not defeated in a quarter century.
Before the contest, The Crimson stated that “whether [Harvard] is of championship calibre today’s contest will undoubtedly declare.” The game thus aroused “an extraordinary amount of interest” among students, who eagerly picked up $2 tickets at Cambridge locales like Leavitt and Peirce’s, Wright & Ditson’s, and the Co-op and also submitted manuscripts to a football song competition that was open to all members of the university. (The school was resolved to have "good singing at games this year, or none at all," according to The Crimson.) Though Princeton had scored far more points than Harvard—a much more conservative team that tended to punt on first or second down in order to get back on defense—the two squads had similar strengths and weaknesses.
“Both [teams’] backfields have displayed the same consistent, and at times spectacular, ability,” the paper explained, but each squad also “showed the same urgent need of more practice in tackling.”
As the big game approached, The Crimson noted that “predictions as to the result of a game between two teams so evenly matched are practically impossible; but there can be no doubt that it will be unusually interesting and spectacular. Our confidence in our team remains unshaken, for we realize its ability and fighting spirit, and we feel that the memory of last year's [8-6] defeat will help to arouse the players to their greatest efforts.”
On gameday, that was exactly what occurred. The Crimson took a 3-0 lead on a short Brickley field goal. Despite rushing for 109 yards in the first half, Princeton was only able to score via the air, as a 25-yard completion set up a shorter touchdown pass and gave the Tigers a 6-3 lead at the half.
But Brickley’s leg continued to shine, as the sophomore drilled another field goal in the third quarter and then a 47-yarder in the fourth to give the Crimson the lead. Hardwick added a late touchdown run and the extra point to put away a 16-6 victory as the Harvard defense held the Tigers to -9 yards on the ground in the second half.
“Contrary to the general supposition of spectators,” The Crimson noted that Brickley escaped the game with only a few muscle bruises, but Harvard’s coaches nonetheless gave him and the entire team a rest from practice the Monday following the physical match.
CHAMPIONSHIP FEVER
In its next contest, Harvard took on Vanderbilt, and its coaches, The Crimson noted, made sure not to underrate “this championship team of the South, and consequently [prepared] for a fast, light team with a versatile attack similar to that of Princeton.” It was the Commodores’ first trip to Harvard Stadium, and the paper, noting the economic and logistical difficulty of playing teams from outside the northeast, pointed out that “this intersectional rivalry cannot but result, in some degree, at least, in an increase of friendship and understanding.”
The Commodores had outscored their opponents 342-3 to that point, and seats were in high demand at $1.50 each between the twenty-yard lines and $1.00 outside them. When game day finally arrived, the home fans—except for the 205 students who couldn’t attend because they had resold tickets to previous games and were thus on the “Football Black List”—were rewarded with a 9-3 victory, despite the fact that the Crimson chose to play all of its reserves. It would be the Commodores’ only loss of the season, and they suffered a number of prominent injuries during it.
In its penultimate game on Nov. 16, Harvard faced a Dartmouth team that according to The Crimson arrived in Cambridge “full of confidence and determined to win.” The paper noted that “as this is the final game of the season for the Green, every energy has been utilized to build up a fast and aggressive team.... The Dartmouth eleven will put forth every effort and use every style of play it has mastered in order to gain the victory.”
But despite its will, the Big Green could not score against the vaulted Crimson defense, which helped Harvard earn a 3-0 win. The Crimson alternated simple line plunges and end runs throughout—also trying one of Vanderbilt’s passing plays from the week before—and the lone score came on a Brickley seven-yard drop-kick in the third quarter. Though Brickley missed his other three field-goal attempts, he made up for that by rushing for 68 of Harvard’s 190 yards on the ground.
In its final game of the season, Harvard, 8-0 to that point, traveled to New Haven to face a 7-0-1 Yale team. Despite the lack of losses on both sides, Harvard was considered a heavy favorite. Of the over 33,000 people who attended the game, 16,000 supported Harvard while 17,000 rooted for the Bulldogs, according to The Crimson. But Yale’s fans could not spur its team to victory, as Harvard capped a perfect season with a 20-0 win.
Storer scored the Crimson’s opening touchdown, the school’s first against the Bulldogs in over a decade. Brickley added a pair of field goals—the second set up by his own 40-yard run—and following a forced fumble by Hardwick, the sophomore added his ninth score of the year in the third quarter.
The Crimson capped the championship-clinching win with the “snake dance,” a victory celebration in which the Harvard fans joined hands and zig-zagged toward the goal post, over which they tossed their hats.
A WIDE-RANGING LEGACY
Following an undefeated season in which Harvard had outscored its opponents, 176-22, despite a challenging schedule, the championship team was honored at the Copley-Plaza Hotel with what The Crimson called the “largest Harvard dinner ever held in Boston.” Approximately 600 alumni were in attendance, including nearly the entire 1890 championship team as well as President Lowell.
At the year’s conclusion, Felton, Storer, Pennock, Gardner, Brickley, Wendell, and Hardwick all earned All-America honors and went on to a wide array of futures.
After graduating from Harvard, Felton declined a three-year offer to play professional baseball for Connie Mack’s Philadelphia Athletics valued at $15,000 per year with the option of unconditional release—then the largest ever offer to a collegiate athlete. He did so despite the fact that the normally-conservative Mack tried “as he has never before done” to sign Felton because Mack felt Felton could have been “one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game,” according to the Washington Post. The star athlete, from a wealthy family, instead returned to his home in Haverford, Penn., to pursue a career in business.
Storer, a Boston native, served as captain of another undefeated and untied Harvard football team in 1913—the last such squad until 2001. He would go on to fight in World War I, serving as a major and commander of Battery E of the 305th Field Artillery. In September 1918, he was noted for his bravery in saving a French officer while on a reconnaissance mission.
Storer’s fellow interior lineman, Pennock, was once again named an All-American the following two seasons. After graduating, he partnered with a pair of classmates and opened a chemistry laboratory, but he was killed in an gasoline-induced explosion at a chemical plant in New Jersey in 1916. At his funeral, six of his Harvard teammates, including his former roommate Brickley, carried his body to his grave in Syracuse. He was posthumously elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.
Brickley—from a family of athletes—is still tied for the Harvard record for field goals made in a season with the 13 he scored in 1912. His 94 points that year and 215 during the course of his career were school records that stood for 92 years, and his five field goals in the following year’s matchup with Yale clinched another national title for the Crimson. The kicker later became a coach, and after turning down offers from NYU and Penn State accepted the head coaching job at Johns Hopkins in 1915. He next became the head coach at Boston College and Fordham, but after ample legal trouble stemming from poor investments and illegal financial practices, he died of heart disease in 1949. Hours before his death, the former Crimson star, disappointed at his alma mater’s recent struggles, allegedly told a reporter that “what Harvard needs is a czar of football to get the game on a sound basis.” Numerous obituaries noted that Brickley “found the game of football easier than the game of life.”
Hardwick, a Quincy native who was a three-sport varsity athlete at Harvard, was later named by Rice as one of the five greatest competitors the writer had ever seen, along with the likes of Ty Cobb and Jack Dempsey. Like Storer, Hardwick also fought in World War I, serving as a U.S. Army artillery captain who commanded a trench mortar unit in France. He then went on to a successful career in business, helping found the Boston Garden in 1929. Hardwick died of a heart attack while clamming at Church’s Beach on Cuttyhunk Island off the Massachusetts coast in 1949, and Rice, in an obituary, wrote that “of all the college football players I’ve ever known since 1900, I would say he was top man in the matter of flaming spirit. He loved football with an intensity beyond belief.... If football had a weakness for Hardwick it was that the game was not quite rough enough.” Along with Pennock, the fullback was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.
HAUGHTON REMEMBERED
Finally, there was Haughton, who much to the relief of the student body signed a three-year extension to remain at Harvard through 1916. Prior to his hiring, it had been customary for schools to change head coaches every year or two, regardless of their record. Upon the contract’s expiration, Haughton served in World War I and in 1923 was named head coach at Columbia, a program that had been disbanded in 1905 following allegations of being too violent.  The coach died after suffering a heart attack on the Lions’ home field on October 27, 1924. He compiled a career record of 97-17-6 and 71-7-5 at Harvard—still the fourth most wins in Crimson history—and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951.
Following Haughton’s death, Hardwick remarked that “I came to Harvard placing Mr. Haughton on a pedestal. He was the idol of a boy’s intense hero worship. I worked three years under that idol, and I left college even a greater disciple of, not ‘Mr. Haughton,’ but my close friend ‘P. D.’”
A white stone memorial—designed by the Boston firm Walker, Walker, and Kingsbury and sculpted by Mary O. Bowditch for a cost of $10,000—was erected outside the Locker Building at Soldier’s Field on November 19, 1927. The largest tablet featured the coach, in uniform, in a characteristic crouch with one knee on the ground, and beneath it were the words “In Memory of Percy Duncan Haughton.”  The other two panels featured a punter and a tackler.
Dean L.B.R. Briggs, Class of 1876, Chairman of the Athletic Committee during Haughton’s tenure at Harvard, summed up his eulogy with a belief that is still widely held today: “I believe that those who know football regard Percy Haughton as one of the greatest coaches that the game has seen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year Harvard football scored 374 points, setting a Crimson modern era record.  This Saturday’s home opener against the University of San Diego Toreros will tell if Harvard can do just as well this season amid changing lineups.
Perhaps one of the biggest questions will be if newly starting senior quarterback Colton Chapple will permanently fill the shoes of graduated quarterback Collier Winters ’11.  Filling in for an injured Winters last season, Chapple won two Ivy League Player of the Week awards and became the first Crimson quarterback ever to throw for four touchdowns in consecutive games.
“You could literally say every good word in the book about Colton and his dedication towards the game,” said senior center Jack Holuba. “I love the way Colton plays. He plays within himself, doesn’t try to do too much, [and] makes the smart decisions.”
Another big change comes at wide receiver, where the Crimson graduated its top three players in Adam Chrissis ’12, Chris Lorditch ’11, and Alex Sarkisian ’12.
“Losing a lot of receivers always—it’s a concern. Whenever you lose a lot at one position makes it a concern,” said senior running back Treavor Scales last week.
Filling in the gaps will be players such as sophomore Seitu Smith II and juniors Andrew Berg and Ricky Zorn who are largely untested after seeing limited action last year.
“Most notably [making strides] was our receiving corps,” said senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk. “I think guys like Andrew Berg and Ricky Zorn...really, really improved this summer. I think they really benefitted from being here.”
Despite losing several key players, Harvard will return 17 starters and 47 letter winners. Two of those are the offense’s most productive players from a year ago—Juszczyk and junior Cam Brate.
Last year Juszczyk, who won the College Football Performance Award as the nation’s top tight end, caught 37 passes for 512 yards, while Brate added 25 receptions for 386 yards. The teammates also tied for the team lead with seven touchdowns each.
Another weapon on the offensive end is Scales, who finished last year with eight touchdowns and 816 yards on just 170 carries.
“Having Treavor Scales in the backfield with you doesn’t hurt you at all,” Chapple said. “The kid’s been All-Ivy since his freshman year. He’s a complete back who can carry the ball 20 plus times a game. He can catch out of the backfield. He can pass protect—he can do it all.”
Holuba, one of Harvard’s 16 players to be named to the Preseason All-Ivy Team, will be a steady force in the Crimson’s offensive line.
On defense, Harvard lost a number of stars as well, namely Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year Josue Ortiz ’11, alongside linebacker and former captain Alex Gedeon ’12 and cornerback Matthew Hanson ’12.
Despite losing Ortiz, the team’s defensive line still retains a lot of talent, starting with seniors John Lyon, Nnamdi Obukwelu, and Grant Sickle, junior Jack Dittmer, and sophomore Zach Hodges.
At linebacker, captain Bobby Schneider and seniors Alexander Norman and Joshua Boyd also return.
“Bobby is a warrior,” Holuba said. “He is the most technically sound football player I have ever seen in my entire life. [He’s] the guy who has been in exactly the perfect position at every moment on every play.”
On special teams, senior punter Jacob Dombrowski and junior kicker David Mothander will be back on the field as well.
The Crimson has won the last 11 home openers and beat 20 of its last 27 non-league opponents dating back to 2003.
Harvard has never before faced San Diego, but the Toreros have a 2-6 record against teams in the Ancient Eight. The last Ivy team to face San Diego was Yale in 2006, and the Toreros won 43-17.
Along with the Crimson, San Diego was ranked among the Football Championship Subdivision’s top 10 in winning percentage last season.
The Toreros have already played two games this season. In its most recent game, San Diego pulled out a 34-27 come-from-behind victory over Western New Mexico, but the Toreros lost their home opener, 41-14, to Cal Poly.
Going into Saturday’s game, the Crimson is a 21-point favorite and also the favorite to repeat as Ivy League Champions after receiving 13 of 15 first place votes in the Ancient Eight preseason poll.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After claiming two big wins on the road against Colgate and Quinnipiac, the Harvard women’s soccer team returns home in hopes of snatching another convincing victory, this time against local rival No. 5 Boston College.
When the Crimson (3-1-1) and the Eagles (5-0-2) face off on Saturday evening at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, the first meeting between these two programs in nearly three years, both teams will be playing for not just an early season victory against a top-tier opponent but also for bragging rights in one of the most hotly contested local rivalries.
“We definitely have a lot of respect for them as a team and as a program,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said.
“BC is a really strong team,” junior co-captain Peyton Johnson added. “Their program has done really well in the past so we welcome them as a challenge. We feel that we have nothing to lose but a lot to prove, so it should be a fun game.”
Harvard controls the all-time series against BC, leading 19-11-4 in 34 meetings. The Eagles, however, have won the last two recent meetings. In 2009, the Crimson and BC met in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, and the Eagles emerged victorious, 1-0, after an early second half goal. Earlier in the 2009 season, BC trounced Harvard, 4-1, dominating from start to finish.
But for this year’s Crimson squad, the memories of the program’s past struggles against the Eagles are the furthest thing on their minds.
“Right now we don’t have much institutional memory against BC,” Johnson said. “We are a pretty young team and for us each year is different, so we are looking forward to showing what we have this year.”
Harvard comes into this contest fresh off a commanding 3-0 victory over Quinnipiac on Wednesday. In its last two games against the Bobcats and Raiders, the Crimson was able to capitalize on early scoring opportunities and maintain possession of the ball in order to control the game.
To come out on top against a formidable Eagles team, Harvard will have to replicate its style of play from the last two victories, by finding its offensive rhythm early in the game and by keeping BC without the ball and as far away from the penalty box as possible.
Another important factor in Harvard’s success so far this season has been its strength in the net. In Wednesday’s game against Quinnipiac, sophomore goalkeepers Kanten and Cheta Emba combined for a shutout on the road.
So far this season, Kanten has registered 24 saves while allowing just six goals, good enough for an 80 percent save rate.
The Eagles visit the Crimson having opened this year’s season undefeated with six victories and two ties. BC has outscored its opponents, 18-7, and outshot them by a stunning margin of 127 to 63.
In the Eagles’ most recent game against No. 8 UCF, both teams battled to a 1-1 draw after two overtime periods. Leading BC in that match and so far this season is senior midfielder Kristen Mewis.
With her goal against UCF, Mewis extended her scoring streak to seven consecutive games while also maintaining the distinction of having scored a goal or delivered an assist in every game this season for the Eagles.
A deciding factor in this weekend’s contest will be how well the Crimson back line can contain the dynamism and play-making abilities of Mewis and the rest of the BC offense.
And with its first Ivy matchup of the season taking place on Sept. 21 at Penn, Harvard will look to use the game against the Eagles as its final tuneup before the start of conference play.
“The main thing that we are looking for [against BC] is to maintain a strong mentality going into next week’s game. That’s when our important games, our Ivy games, start for us,” Kanten said. “So the questions that we are going to have for ourselves moving forward are: Can we finish strong as a team? Can we stay positive? And can [we] continue to play our style and not allow other teams to control the game?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is not quite the same as The Game, but Saturday’s game between Harvard and Yale field hockey at Jordan Field will have no less significance to either team as Ivy League play begins for the both squads.
The Crimson (1-3) is coming off a weekend where it suffered two 3-0 losses, away at Providence on Saturday and home against No. 17 Boston College on Sunday.
To prepare for this weekend’s rivalry against the Bulldogs (1-2), Harvard has been focusing on making more efficient runs, passing, and ultimately finishing, having had limited success on offense thus far.
Sophomore midfielder Caitlin Rea leads the team so far with 12 shots and two assists, while sophomore forward Catriona McDonald and junior back Carly McNeill have a goal apiece.
Yale was recently shut out by Hofstra, 1-0, at home—the Bulldogs’ second shutout of the season after losing, 4-0, to Fairfield in its first game of the season. Yale’s lone win was against Quinnipiac last Saturday when the team scored three goals in the second half for a comeback victory.
“They were very strong on the ball and had strong tackles,” Crimson sophomore Sydney Jenkins said, "so we’re going to work a lot on our passing game, which [is what] we do best.”
Co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos provided a bright spot last weekend for Harvard, moving into third place all-time in program saves with 446.
“It’s really a blessing having [Tassopoulos] on the team,” Jenkins said. “She is really a powerful voice out there, and she reassures a lot of us.”
Despite three straight losses, the Crimson will look to improve entering conference play.
“We are looking forward to learning from the experiences we have had so far this season and just bringing all it together,” Jenkins said. “We are all really excited for Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last year’s edition of the annual Harvard-Yale cross country meet, the Crimson’s men’s squad dominated the Bulldogs, while the women’s team fell in decisive fashion. But as Harvard heads to New Haven on Friday, both races appear up for grabs.
On the women’s side, the Crimson is fresh off a victorious performance at last weekend’s Nassaney Invitational.
If Harvard hopes to knock off Yale this Friday, it will rely on similarly strong showings from junior Morgan Kelly and seniors Briana Jackucewicz and Samantha Silva, both of whom placed in the top five at the meet.
“We had a really strong season opener, and I know Yale did too,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “It should be fun to see how we match up against them.”
The majority of Harvard’s men’s team did not run the full race at last weekend’s meet. Instead, the squad ran the first five kilometers of the 8k course to get race experience and did not post a team score.
On the other hand, the Bulldogs’ men’s squad had an impressive season opener last weekend, winning the Fordham Fiasco meet.
Yale’s striking outing caused them to leapfrog Harvard in the rankings. Going into Friday’s meet, the Bulldogs sit in the No. 9 spot in the USTFCCCA Northeast region rankings, just above the No. 10 Crimson.
According to Saretsky, the formula for the Harvard men is simple.
“The key for the men is going to be discipline,” Saretsky said. “If we can run with discipline, we should come out on top.”
The ability of the Crimson’s runners to keep their poise will be especially important due to the competitive nature of the rivalry.
“Two teams line up on the starting line,” Saretsky said. “Time doesn’t matter. Everything is thrown out the window other than ‘Can you beat the person next to you?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team was nearly unanimously considered a favorite to repeat as Ivy League champions four days ago. After the withdrawal of co-captain senior Kyle Casey and the expected departure of Brandyn Curry, the team’s championship prospects have significantly diminished.
“From a purely Bball perspective, this season feels wide open now,” Ivy Hoops Online tweeted Tuesday night. “[Princeton] probably out front but anyone could crack top half this year. #fun.”
Basketball writer Andy Katz said that their expected absences create an opportunity for Yale and Columbia in particular.
The parity in Ivy League competition this year may be fun for Ivy fans, but players are not viewing the current situation that way.
“My heart automatically went out to [Casey and Curry] because they’re both good guys and good competitors,” Penn junior Miles Cartwright said. “I know it’s hard for both of them to go through this.”
Even from the perspective of a rival and potential benefactor of Harvard’s loss, Yale senior Austin Morgan believed the situation was unfortunate.
“Obviously we are inextricably linked, Yale and Harvard,” Morgan said. “As a competitor, I would never wish this on anybody.”
“Kyle Casey is a great player,” Morgan added. “He is one of the players that is most respected in our league. It is unfortunate that this had to happen during his senior year.”
Though both players showed sympathy for the situation players are in, they did not condone the alleged actions.
“When you’re super busy and you’re juggling a lot of different things, it’s hard,” Cartwright said. “But it should never come down to that point to take shortcuts.”
From a basketball perspective, Katz said that the potential loss of Curry would have a larger impact on the team.
“If Brandyn is gone, that’s a major, major blow,” Katz said. “One thing they don’t have is experience in the backcourt, specifically at point guard.”
Katz said that the loss will be most evident early in the year as Curry's and Casey’s younger replacements adjust to their larger roles. By the time the team reaches the heart of its conference schedule though, the team should look strong.
“I don’t think it affects them long term,” Katz said. “I think they’ve recruited well enough where I think they’ll be ok.”
Tom Stemberg ’71, the honorary chairman of Friends of Harvard Basketball, believes that the scandal will not affect the alumni support group nor its relationship with the team.
When asked to comment in an email about the impact, Stemberg wrote, “There will not be any. People make mistakes. They pay the price. Life will go on.”
Co-chair of Friends of Harvard Basketball Tom Mannix ’81 thinks it is still too early to understand what, if any, long-term ramifications the scandal will have on the program.
 
“Until  I really know how the decision was made, both in terms of why Kyle  [Casey] decided to withdraw and what [Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s] role  in that was, and how it’s going to be disseminated.... It’s impossible to know [the impact].”
Despite the withdrawal of Casey and the expected departure of Curry, Mannix remains optimistic about Harvard’s chances this season.
“I’m not going to belittle how big of a hole [Casey and Curry] will be.... However, there are a lot of really good players left, and Tommy [Amaker] is a leader and an inspiring leader,” Mannix said.
As for Cartwright, the Penn junior was hesitant to remove the Crimson from the conference’s mantle.
“They’re still the defending champs, so right now I guess you would say they’re on top,” Cartwright said. “I know from our standpoint, we’re still going to come out and compete because we feel like we had chance to win even before scandal, so we’re just going to come out and play hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a historic run through the Ivy League in 2011, the Harvard football team is the heavy favorite to take the crown once again this season.
In the first-ever Ivy League Sportswriters Football Preseason Poll—in which two representatives from each Ivy League student newspaper cast votes—the Crimson emerged as the clear favorite, tallying 124 points and 13 of 16 first-place votes.
While most believe the title will remain in Cambridge, some have pegged Penn (106 points) and Cornell (98), led by the reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year Jeff Mathews, to upend Harvard. All 16 first-place votes went to the Crimson, the Quakers, or Cornell.
Brown, Yale, and Dartmouth finished in fourth through sixth, respectively, a season after all three schools graduated their greatest offensive threats. The Bears lost quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero, quarterback Patrick Witt is no longer a Bulldog, and running back Nick Schwieger has left the Big Green.
Rounding out the rankings are Columbia and Princeton, both of which captured just one Ivy win last season. Both squads are expected to struggle again in 2012.
For all eight Ivy League teams, the season commences on Saturday. Harvard opens its campaign with a home contest against San Diego before its Ivy opener a week later at Brown.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
September 12, 1951: A Friend of the Students
"Harvard students have been giving me the business for 29 years," reports Benny Jacobson, Harvard Square's King of Kleaning. Benny is a self-admitted "University personality," and few would contest the point. Owner of the Gold Coast Valeteria at 30 Plympton Street, this former second-string halfback for Boston English High School is one of the biggest supporters of the Crimson football team.
Benny takes a personal interest in all of Gold Coast's 3,500 customers and is very anxious to get to know all of the new students entering this fall. "I used to visit the new men in their rooms, but now I ask them to drop by the Gold Coast so that they can see how we do business." Benny remains silent about his benefactions, but there are countless happy graduates, leading successful lives today, who Benny got out of jams while in College.
September 15, 1975: Dean Arthurs Finds Radcliffe a Harvard Home
Alberta Arthurs has only herself to blame for the fact that she is leaving her post as dean of the now-extinct Radcliffe Office of Admissions, Financial Aid and Women's Education to assume the deanship of Harvard's new Office of Undergraduate Affairs. After all, Arthurs has been hard at work for the last two years preparing the scenario for her own exit. Voicing her views "very noisily" on the Strauch Committee, Arthurs pushed for an admissions policy that would make her own Byerly Hall bailiwick superfluous. Now, with equal access and merged admissions offices a reality, she is sadly saying goodbye to what she calls "an independent, autonomous, happy office."
September 10, 1980: A New Varsity Takes the Plunge
"It's a first for everybody." So says senior John Hansen, co-captain and one of the prime movers behind Harvard's latest varsity sport—water polo.
For the first time this year, the men's water polo team—elevated from club status last April—will compete at the full varsity level. The years of borrowing cars for road trips, struggling to fill out a schedule with often mediocre teams and rallying friends to come out for the game are over.
"It's going to make a difference," promises rookie coach Stephen Pike, who served as adviser to the water polo club for the last two years. "There's going to be more of a commitment to water polo."
September 10, 1984: Harvard, IBM Offering Cheap New Computers
In the University's third cut-rate compiler deal in less than a year, Harvard and the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) have linked up to provide top-of-the-line computer's to students and staff at up to 35 percent off standard retail value.
Three IBM computers—the PC, the PC/XT, and the PC Portable—are now available from the Equipment Management Store on a first-come-first-served basis, officials said.
Earlier this year, Harvard struck deals with the Apple Computer Company and the Digital Electronics Corporation (DEC), under which the companies provide students with some of their best-selling models at similar reductions.
