After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands—I began my trip to Amsterdam as I do most trips, with some apprehension. The prospect of rowdy bands of men prowling the Red Light District in search of weed and women didn’t exactly excite me. At first, my low expectations proved true, and where I would normally delight a bit in the kitschy tourist culture, I was rather annoyed; the sex shops seemed like they were there more to scandalize American teenagers than as a sign of the city’s liberal spirit.
At night, though, Amsterdam fascinated me. After several beers (take this as a euphemism, or not) and a few cosmic coincidences, I finally got it. My one night there coincided with the Red Light Jazz festival, so some friends and I walked toward the music’s magnetic power and into the closest bar. There, a jazz quartet was playing their hearts out.
A few songs later, a burlesque dancer came onstage—the greatest chance encounter of all. I couldn’t help myself, staring and oohing along with everyone else as she stripped, teased and gyrated. How different was I now from the marauding men I had despised hours before?
I love the way that Amsterdam makes voyeurs out of us all, whether we buy into it (via two-euro peep shows) or just happen to stumble into a burlesque show. Whether the scenes terrify or excite you, one thing’s for sure: You can’t look away.

University President Drew G. Faust wrote that Harvard will “vigorously defend” its admissions policies in the face of an ongoing lawsuit claiming that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in an email to students Tuesday.
Faust wrote that Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action group bringing the suit, was “formed in part to oppose Harvard’s commitment to diversity” and wrote the school will stand by its admissions procedures that have previously been held up as a model for constitutionally sound affirmative action.
“As this case generates widespread attention and comment, Harvard will react swiftly and thoughtfully to defend diversity as the source of our strength and our excellence—and to affirm the integrity of our admissions process,” Faust wrote. “A diverse student body enables us to enrich, to educate, and to challenge one another.”
Students for Fair Admissions filed their lawsuit in 2014 claiming that the school’s admissions policies were discriminatory and illegal. The College has repeatedly maintained that it “does not discriminate against applicants from any group in its admissions processes.”
Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.
Faust, who will leave the presidency at the end of the month as Lawrence S. Bacow assumes his role at Harvard’s helm, reflected in her letter back on her final commencement last month.
“Tercentenary Theatre was filled with individuals from the widest range of backgrounds and life experiences,” she wrote. It was a powerful reminder that the heart of this extraordinary institution is its people.”
In early April, U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled that Harvard must make some redacted admissions information public as part of the legal proceedings. Court filings in May indicate that the trial is set for Oct. 15, 2018.
Faust concluded her letter saying that the school must defend its ideals.
“I am committed to ensuring that veritas will prevail,” she wrote.

Laura F. Hawkins and Monique A. Roy will be the next resident deans of Quincy House and Pforzheimer House, respectively, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced Tuesday in a letter to colleagues.
Hawkins will take over for Judith X. Flynn, who has served as Quincy’s resident dean for 13 years. Roy will replace Brigitte A. B. Libby, Pforzheimer’s resident dean for the past four years.
In her letter, O’Dair noted that Hawkins will bring experience in the Harvard community to her new role. She served as Quincy’s interim resident dean in the fall 2017, and was the Director of Special Projects in the College’s Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct this past spring.
She holds a D.Phil. from the University of Oxford in Assyriology and will live with her husband David T. Severson, a Medical School student, and her two cats.
Roy’s tenure as resident dean will mark her first Harvard-affiliated role. She previously served as a graduate resident assistant and teaching fellow at Boston University, an interim director of a French center at the University of Maine, and a community director at Dartmouth.
A graduate of Dartmouth College, she holds a Ph.D. from Boston University in French. She will live with her wife Julia Patten in Pforzheimer.
Libby announced in April that she would step down from her position as Pforzheimer’s resident dean to take on her current role as assistant dean for the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct.
Quincy began its resident dean search roughly one month before Libby’s announcement.
Both Hawkins and Roy will move into their houses in July.
