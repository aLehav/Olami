The Curls
Each year, Pitchfork uses its high-profile festival as an opportunity to bring attention to local Chicago-based musicians. They kicked off this year’s festival with Windy City natives The Curls, a fun, nostalgic sextet whose genre fluidity necessitates a string of hyphenated descriptors—“art-funk-jazz-psycho-punk-pop-rock” doesn’t even cover all the bases. Embracing kitsch rather than avoiding it, The Curls borrow their favorite little nuggets from every era of music. Back-up singers performed goofy choreographed dances with lead singer Anna Holmquist, completing a three-part harmony reminiscent of ‘60s girl groups, ‘90s Riot Grrrl, and modern punk bands like T-Rextasy. A hipster moustache-clad brass section swayed from side to side as they embellished songs with the grandest, corniest funky flourishes. Various band members channeled ‘70s punk by wearing t-shirts emblazoned with Sharpie slogans like “No Cop Academy” and “Fund Community and Schools,” while playing psychedelic guitar riffs that could have been written by Jimi Hendrix on songs like, “Prickly Feelings.” Even “Macarena” made its way into the performance. It all could have easily felt like a grown up version of Saturday Night Live’s “High School Theatre Show” if it weren’t so much fun to watch the band loving pop culture with such earnest, nerdy fervor.
Joshua Abrams & Natural Information Society
There’s one artist on every festival lineup that makes you wonder, “What the hell were they thinking?” This year’s chin-scratcher was the Dude Lebowski lookalike Joshua Abrams, former bassist for hip-hop legends The Roots, whose 50-minute set consisted of one song, a loop built around a three-stringed African lute called the guimbri. Abrams is not the first white guy to take inspiration from African music—although Vampire Weekend and even Peter Gabriel are a little more hip with the kids. That said, festival-goers enthusiastically sucked on their dab pens as they surrendered themselves to the enrapturing trance of Natural Information Society. The “song” (perhaps it would be more accurately described as an experience) droned on with a weird momentum that felt heavy and sticky like sludge, trapping you in and allowing you to truly get “lost in the music.” While most band members remained stone-faced (except for the occasional “I’m feeling this so hard” grimace popular with only the most devoted musicians), toward the end of the set, Abrams often broke into a grin as he plunked his guimbri, whose sound combines the richness of an upright bass with the bounce of a marimba. Was he laughing to himself about the absurdity of his presence? Or was he simply taking delight in the music he was making? There’s a lot about Joshua Abrams and the Natural Information Society that’s hard to explain.
Tierra Whack
It can’t be fun to have to replace Earl Sweatshirt, and rapper Tierra Whack did not try to hide her anxiety (“I was nervous as fuck backstage. Are you guys bored?”). Her gentle self-deprecation didn’t feel cloying, but refreshingly genuine, just like the 15 one-minute songs that make up her “Whack World,” her debut album, which includes a short film that oozes with fierce creativity. Whack, however, does not rely on the colorful visuals—her Pitchfork performance proved that her energy and cleverness are more than enough to charm an audience. Although the rapper arrived onstage 10 minutes late and left 15 minutes early (having a 15-minute long discography has its downsides), she made up for brevity with engagement, demanding audience participation with questions (“What song do you motherfuckers wanna hear?), prescribed dance moves (“If you know this song, put your hands up!”), and call-and-response chants (“When I say ‘whack,’ you say ‘whack!’”) With the audience adequately hyped, Whack’s uniquely imaginative and pleasantly addictive songs shone like the diamonds and pearls referenced in her song, “Hungry Hippo.” Along with tabletop games made popular by relentless advertisements, Whack sang with glee and goofiness about everything from fruit salad (à la The Wiggles) to her dearly departed do. And, to Whack’s delighted surprise, much of the audience sang right along with her.
Mount Kimbie
You might know Mount Kimbie as the guys who do the beats under a few King Krule songs. Though their set was relatively sparsely attended (most festivalgoers forewent the post-dubstep duo to see indie rocker Courtney Barnett), it was one of Friday’s best performances. Dominic Maker, Kai Campos, and the vocalist/synth player who joined them onstage stood their ground with an effortless cool that felt contagious rather than intimidating. When all three musicians turned their heads side to side with the beat, they looked so cool that many audience members felt the need to try out the move for themselves. Mount Kimbie’s audience also danced far more than at any other Friday set—while the average Pitchfork audience stands still and JUULs thoughtfully, Mount Kimbie’s delicious beats nudged his crowd into a smooth frenzy. To be fair, the vocals were nowhere near as iconic as those by frequent collaborators like Krule, Micachu, or James Blake, but this only highlighted the aesthetic beauty of Mount Kimbie’s melodies and the soft, bouncy synths, which flowed sweetly with the post-rain breeze.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early Friday afternoon at the Pitchfork Music Festival, Virginia-based indie rock darling Lucy Dacus took to the Green Stage. Under cloudy skies and light rain, she and her band arrived onstage to a quiet, yet eager and attentive crowd. “I’m really afraid of getting electrocuted,” Dacus joked about the showers. “But it’ll be fun!” The audience laughed as she jumped into her first song: “Addictions.” A popular single from her latest album “Historian,” “Addictions” quickly engaged the audience’s attention, with many fans chiming in and singing along to the song’s hook every time it came around. Dacus also played a few older songs off of her debut LP, “No Burden,” including two fan-favorites, “I Don’t Wanna Be Funny Anymore” and “Strange Torpedo,” both of which were impossible not to nod along to. Right before the latter, she shared with the audience how four years ago, she was a festivalgoer at Pitchfork herself. “I went to see Kendrick Lamar,” she chuckled, while the audience yelled out cheers of support. She and her band topped off their set with an electrifying performance of “Night Shift” from “Historian.” Dacus captivated the audience with her deep and lush vocal tone, and when the song reached its emotional peak, one couldn’t help but belt out Dacus’s heart-wrenching lyrics with her, as she repeated them over and over again: “You’ve got a nine-to-five, so I’ll take the night shift / And I’ll never see you again, if I can help it.”
A few hours later, Chicago-based rapper Saba, whose set was a definite highlight of the day, hit the Red Stage to a sizeable crowd of devoted fans. He burst onstage with an infectious energy, repeatedly asking the audience how they were doing before starting his set. His “how y’all doing?” grew louder and louder each time he asked it, building such an anticipation that, soon, the audience’s cheers drowned out Saba’s own question. At that point, he kicked off the set with an exhilarating performance of “BUSY”—a standout from his latest album, “CARE FOR ME”—then segued into a soulful rendition of “BROKEN GIRLS,” asking every girl in the audience to put her hands in the air. After a few welcome throwbacks from his debut album, “Bucket List Project,” Saba paused for a bit to speak directly to the crowd. “I’m from the west side of Chicago,” he shared. “This is the type of shit we dreaming about—look at how many people are here.” The audience roared in encouragement. Though there was never a dull or low-energy moment in the Chicago rapper’s set, the definite highpoint came towards the end, when after a 10-second quiet spell, the iconic bass line from “LIFE” burst through the arena, slowing down the tempo of the performance, but nevertheless taking the intensity of the energy exchange to a whole new level.
Soon after, Brooklyn’s Big Thief took to the Blue Stage and performed a captivating set, comprised of charming indie-folk songs from their 2016 record “Masterpiece” and last year’s “Capacity,” as well as a handful of completely new songs. Only two chords and roughly two seconds into the set, the audience roared in glee—it only took so long to recognize “Masterpiece,” the eponymous track and a standout from their 2016 LP. Watching lead guitarist Buck Meek and frontwoman Adrienne Lenker collaborating on stage was a mesmerizing thing to experience—both were co-founders of the band and have a long history of making music together, so the connection between them was palpable throughout their performance of “Masterpiece,” “Shark Smile,” and many other songs. A standout from their show was their live version of “Mary,” which found Lenker solo for the first time in the set. With only the golden tones from her guitar and her evocative, tender voice, Lenker quieted a crowd of hundreds as soon as she uttered the song’s opening lyrics. Her voice, though gentle and soft, proved to have that uncanny quality—the ability to stun an entire arena into silence for its tone alone. Even as the drizzles of rain from earlier in the day made a return, threatening to disrupt her performance, almost no one in the crowd reached into their bags to fumble for an umbrella or raincoat. As is typical for really any Big Thief performance, the audience remained completely transfixed until the song’s very end.
Rounding out the night on the Red Stage before headliner Tame Impala came out to perform was indie-rocker Courtney Barnett, who drew a sea of people so gigantic it was difficult to see its end. As the clouds cleared, the Aussie songwriter opened her set with a mellow rendition of “Hopefulessness,” then segued neatly into the upbeat “City Looks Pretty,” both taken from her latest record “Tell Me How You Really Feel.” Though the record only came out two months ago, that didn’t stop Barnett’s fans from yelling her signature tongue-in-cheek lyrics back to her, particularly throughout the deliciously wry “Nameless, Faceless.” Throughout her set, Barnett commanded the audience’s attention unfailingly, shredding up and down the fretboard and jumping on stage in infectious bursts of energy. As she darted from one song to another, the front lights painted her face a deep red, creating a real-time version of the album art from her latest LP. It was a gorgeous visual effect that only made the experience of seeing the songwriter in the flesh feel more surreal. By the time Barnett ended her set with a riveting performance of “Pedestrian at Best,” she had the entire crowd in the palm of her hand. “Give me all your money / And I’ll make some origami, honey!” Barnett howled, a sea of thousands howling right there with her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shouting “people over profits” and throwing pill bottles on the floor, more than 30 demonstrators held a “die-in” in Harvard's Arthur M. Sackler Museum Friday to protest its connections to a family they said spurred on the opioid crisis and profited from addiction nationwide.
Led by photographer Nan Goldin—whose works are displayed in the museum—protesters demanded Harvard refuse future funding from the Sacklers. They also urged the Sackler family to invest in the overdose reversal drug naloxone, safe injection facilities, and medication that can combat addiction. They charged that the family, which helps lead the multi-billion dollar drug company Purdue Pharmaceuticals, knew the pain relief drug OxyContin was highly addictive but downplayed its dangers when marketing it to doctors.
The Sacklers have drawn widespread criticism in recent years for the role some say the family played in spurring the nationwide opioid crisis. Though family members descended from Arthur M. Sackler—a philanthropist and drug marketer—do not have shares in Purdue Pharmaceuticals, his brother’s descendants have served on the company’s board.
The family has also donated extensively to Harvard, paying for the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, one of the museums that comprises the Harvard Art Museums and houses the University’s collection of Asian, Islamic, and Mediterranean art.
Medical School students and the Center for Popular Democracy’s Opioid Network—a band of more than 45 grassroots organizations that have formed in response to the opioid crisis—organized the demonstration.
Darshali Vyas, a fourth-year Medical School student, said she helped spearhead the protest because she thinks the opioid epidemic is “the emergency of our time.”
“This is a crisis, this is impacting our patients, they’re dying, and we want to help them,” she said. “A lot of deaths are very preventable, which I think I and a lot of my classmates have witnessed, and we feel that there is this need for urgent action.”
Robert Josephson, Purdue Pharmaceuticals’ chief director of communications, wrote in an emailed statement Saturday that the company shares Goldin’s “concern about the prescription and illicit opioid crisis,” is “committed to being part of the solution,” and feels that “more needs to be done.”
“Purdue’s led industry efforts to combat prescription drug abuse, which includes collaborating with law enforcement, funding state prescription drug monitoring programs and directing health care professionals to the CDC’s Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain,” he wrote. “In addition, we’ve recently announced educational initiatives aimed at teenagers warning of the dangers of opioids and we continue to fund grants to law enforcement to help with accessing naloxone.”
This is not the first time the Sackler’s donations have drawn criticism from Harvard affiliates. In January, Goldin urged the Art Museums not to accept donations from the family because of what she called their role in starting the opioid epidemic. Several members of the advocacy group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, which Goldin founded, attended Friday’s protest.
Darius K. Gordon, national field organizer for the Center of Popular Democracy, said it was “important” to hold a protest at Harvard because the University is “a very prestigious place.”
“I think just having the Harvard name attached really brings a lot of attention to the issue that is brought up,” he said. “The sooner that we can resolve this issue the better for everyone.”
Demonstrators said they attended the “die-in” both to protest the Sacklers and to call for immediate action to fight the opioid epidemic.
Mardge H. Cohen, a doctor at Boston Healthcare for the Homeless, said she came to the protest because she is “upset and horrified” about the number of preventable deaths from opioid misuse.
“As a physician, as a person in our society, as a grandmother who sees kids playing in parks, I just think we need to address people who are very marginalized, very stigmatized,” she said. “It’s the major public health problem in many many areas in our country.”
“There’s so much that money can accomplish that Harvard has, that the Sacklers still have, that Purdue still makes,” Cohen said. “There’s just so many ways they can make a difference and we’re insisting that they do that.”
Harvard Art Museums spokesperson Daron J. Manoogian declined to comment on the protests.
Correction: July 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Arthur M. Sackler played a major role in distributing OxyContin. In fact, Sackler died nearly 10 years before the drug came to market.
