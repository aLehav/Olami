After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Janet Jackson believes in reincarnation. The Panorama installment of her “State of the World” tour made it impossible for any reasonable watcher to disagree. Songs from across eras took on new life, reinventing samples with them. Present and past icons became larger than life and joined her in song onscreen. Jackson herself—a new mother at 50 whose pregnancy halted her “Unbreakable” album tour in 2016—came back dancing with the full force of her sexuality. Decades of art forms, and human flesh collided at high speed.
The show was part of the final stretch of Jackson’s tour and served as a daring Saturday headliner for Panorama, whose audience is mostly too young to have followed her career. Bookended by its strongest political statements, the show seemed perfectly designed to assert her relevance.
The first of many videos was a frightening compilation of quotes and statistics about gun violence, the US-Mexico border crisis, police killings of black civilians, and white supremacy. A graphic of the black power clenched fist was shown, with members of the endless crowd emulating the symbol themselves. At the tail end of her set, she sang two 1989 songs that call out social inequality: “Rhythm Nation” and “State of the World.” By combining the political convictions of her past work with dark warnings about the present, she underlined both the worth of her early work and the continuation of injustice. Compared to the vague “There are crazy things happening in the world right now, let’s all love each other” speeches heard during earlier acts (such as SZA’s), actually naming the issues and appearing to take a stand on each was bold and authoritative.
Her performance of “What About” tackled another issue: that of abuse. Scenes of domestic violence unfolded among the backup dancers, while Jackson, whose brother has described her previous marriage as abusive, displayed her most vulnerable acting and her most seductive anger. The story that played out onstage concluded in an emotionally significant act, with Jackson fighting back against one of the wrongdoers and pushing him off his chair.
Still, she did not need such a blatant show of force to convey her body’s power. Throughout the 90-minute set, every ponytail toss and hip thrust exuded sex and physical command—sometimes fury, always ferocity. Sweat poured down her temples.
As many issues as this tour was determined to confront, it also had to bear unexpectedly the weight of a personal sorrow. Jackson’s father, Joe Jackson, died prior to the start of her tour’s North America leg one month ago. In tribute, she projected photos of him over the stage during her performance of “Together Again.” She originally wrote this ballad-turned-bop to express her conviction that she would someday be reunited with her friends who died from AIDS. The song’s ability to dance through heartbreak has always been stunning, but in the context of her father’s death it was particularly breathtaking. Her vocals were creamy and youthful. She made heart hands at the audience, who took up the chorus. In response, she laughed and shouted “Oh! Oh! Oh!” in syncopation. While she sang, “I can see your star shining down on me,” a full moon and the images of her father lit up the field together.
She illuminated other artists, too. An enormous video of J. Cole filled in his verse on the sultry “No Sleeep” from her 2015 album “Unbreakable,” and the rendition of “Any Time, Any Place” included a bit of the Kendrick Lamar song (“Poetic Justice”) that samples it. Nicki Minaj was woven into “Nasty.” The audience was eager to sing the Joni Mitchell line (“Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone?”) that Jackson uses as a sample. She also allowed her dancers so much visibility that they could hardly be called backup dancers. The audience went wild for their solos. Alexandra Carson, one memorably talented dancer that Jackson kept close behind her, at times threatened to steal the spotlight.
But Jackson could not be stopped. She was powering through favorites, flaunting the fact that every part of every song was impossibly catchy, and she knew it. After a breakneck compilation of “Nasty,” “Feedback,” “Miss You Much,” “Alright,” and “You Want This,” during which she did not stop dancing for a second, she finally stood still, her hair blowing back, her eyes looking over the audience, and it seemed that they could have screamed for her forever.
However, when she said, sweetly, “That’s a lot of hits,” it was easy to imagine that there was some bitterness about her persecution by the music industry behind the smug words. Amid all the power and perfection of the night’s spectacle, some surprisingly unsettling moments came from Jackson’s struggles to pull her windswept hair out of her mouth. Though she radiated a superhuman status and appeared to have enough energy to live nine lives, the most incredible parts of the spectacle were the reminders, whether planned or accidental, of her humanity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated Sept. 6, 2018 at 12:50 a.m.
The Harvard Financial Aid Office website boasts that 20 percent of students’ families pay nothing to attend the College. The College likes to play up this statistic to encourage poorer students to consider applying. This claim makes it sound like low-income students can come here for free, but that’s misleading. While my family hasn’t been required to pay anything for me to attend Harvard, I personally will have contributed an estimated $18,400 to my education by the end of my time here, despite being on full financial aid.
Most of that cost comes from an annual $3,000 requirement called the “work expectation.”. Every student on financial aid, regardless of income or assets, is expected to work off this amount, according to the College’s Net Price Calculator. Most of the $3,000 contribution does not go directly to the College, but rather towards one’s own “personal expenses” — such as books and travel costs. For a low income student, that cost is burdensome.
Don’t get me wrong; Harvard’s financial aid is generous. Compared to other four-year nonprofit institutions, I am still paying much less than the national average. By the time I graduate, the HFAO will have gifted me over a quarter of a million dollars; I will never, ever, take that for granted. Nevertheless, the work expectation undermines low income students’ financial stability in an extremely regressive manner.
Unfair application of the expectation is the main culprit. Harvard’s wealthiest students are exempt from the work expectation. Instead, because their parents are deemed more able to pay, they pick up the cost, according to the College’s Net Price Calculator. Essentially, rich students are encouraged to pay the fee with their parents’ money, while poor students are expected to work for it.
This creates a subtle system of social stratification among Harvard students. The 45 percent of undergraduates that are wealthy enough to afford Harvard without need-based aid are not required to work; the College encourages them to spend their parents’ money to buy extra time for final clubs or extracurriculars or studying or sleep. Meanwhile, low-income students are compelled by the terms of their financial aid offer to work, whether they want to or not. Does this inequality reflect the real world? Sure. Is it something that Harvard should be deliberately exacerbating through official College policy? Of course not.
In the document that explains the work expectation, the HFAO states that “65% of all Harvard students chose to work during the year.” This is not true. For the 20 percent of students on full financial aid, there was little choice involved in the matter. Those students need to work during the year in order to fulfill the expectation and continue studying at the College. Some among the next poorest 35 percent, who are all on limited aid, are likely in the same boat.
The only choice the College openly offers low-income students is between taking out a subsidized student loan, searching for outside scholarship money, or dedicating an estimated 10 to 12 hours a week to work off the fee. Each of these options is doable, but it’s sad that any are necessary in the first place. A college as wealthy as Harvard doesn’t need to indebt its students, ask them to rely on outside charity, or force them into the labor market. These false choices only exist because the College, as it indicated in its own Net Price Calculator, has an expectation solely applied to the poorest 55 percent of its students.
Moreover, the concept of a work “expectation” is patronizing. While Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana is perfectly fine telling us “you all belong here,” the fee tells us “you need to earn your stay.”
I don’t need a reminder from Harvard that this education requires sacrifice; I accepted that fact when I left my chronically-ill single-mother and two little sisters alone, in poverty, halfway across the country. I don’t need the College to remind me that I need a job. The holes in my shoes do that just fine. The median family income at the College is ten times what my household earns; In the four years I’ve spent on campus, I’ve watched gentrification drive out the last few affordable restaurants in Harvard Square, struggled to pay for summer storage, failed to afford a ticket home for a single Thanksgiving or spring break, and taken countless classes without the required textbooks because it was cheaper to rely on online summaries.
And that’s why abolishing the work expectation is the number one thing Harvard can do for low-income students. Right now, the College is workshopping a program that would give those on full aid $2,000 at the beginning of their freshman year. These “startup grants,” while an important step, only go a fraction of the way toward covering student expenses over the course of a four-year education.
The College should put its poorest students on a more equal footing with its richest, and bolster its startup grant program to more substantially cover expected student costs. That would go a long way towards making the College a more affordable and more equitable place for people on my end of the income bracket.

Correction: Sept. 6, 2018
A previous version of this op-ed incorrectly indicated students on full financial aid pay the College the annual $3,000 work expectation. In fact, the requirement is intended to cover unbilled expenses including living and textbook costs.
