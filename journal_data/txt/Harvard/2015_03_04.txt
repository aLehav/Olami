The artists:
- Sean K. Rodan ’17, Music concentrator in Adams House; classical composer, singer, flautist, and music director of the upcoming Cabot House Musical, “Once Upon a Mattress.”
- Jiye Ha ’16, History of Art and Architecture concentrator in Dunster House, currently studying abroad in Paris, France; aspiring visual artist with experience in drawing, painting, and other two-dimensional art.
“Music is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music.” In saying this, German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe suggests a continuous exchange of aesthetic perspectives between music and visual art throughout history as well as underscores the different ways in which these two art forms treat time and space. Music is more temporally dependent than visual art, as time must pass in order for a musical composition to be heard in full; on the other hand, visual art is more spatially dependent, as drawings, paintings, sculptures, and buildings must be conceived in two or three dimensions. That being said, music also depends on space for sound to be transmitted to listeners’ ears, and the act of moving a pencil or paintbrush across a page is just as immediately temporal as the performance of a musical piece. Therefore, despite (or perhaps because of) their spatial and temporal differences, music and visual art are not entirely distinct disciplines, but are rather complementary, interlocking pieces in a holistic aesthetic puzzle. What brings Sean K. Rodan ’17 and Jiye Ha ’16 together is their mutual interest in exploring these different understandings and manifestations of time and space in art through interdisciplinary artistic collaboration.
The combination of time and space in the form of spacetime is an important topic in physics, but the concept also has an analog in the arts. One could call the artistic equivalent of spacetime “gesture,” a word already widely used in multiple artistic disciplines. A “musical gesture” can be defined as the combination of various sonic elements (volume, duration, pitch, panning) into a single phrase whose multilayered complexity gives it some perceived sense of physicality, while a “gesture drawing” in visual art is a drawing or sketch defined both by its rapid execution and by its attempt to capture an active or moving subject.
Jiye works primarily with drawing and painting, which often lack gestural connotations due to the reduced significance that traditional media assign to time. When viewers look at a static drawing or painting, they have the entire composition laid out immediately before their eyes—as opposed to a musical composition, which is unveiled gradually rather than momentarily. Despite this absence of an objective dimension of time in her work, Jiye understands visual art as fundamentally temporal and therefore gestural in its amalgamation of time and space. “All art operates on some bodily level,” says Jiye. “Even when you’re doing 2-D artwork, you have to use your arm to draw or paint, to make the art materialize.”
Gestures of notation, however, often become lost in their final presentation as a fixed canvas or object, potentially leaving the audience with an incomplete picture of the creative process. The disconnect between the action of input and the inaction of output in traditional art reinforces how the perception and communication of gesture depends not only on the artist’s actions and intentions but also on what the artist’s audience can see. For Jiye, then, what is exciting about interdisciplinary collaboration is the possibility of seeing the inherently gestural nature of her artistic process materialize in the final product. She hopes to work with another art form whose output not only fundamentally changes over time, but also visibly “uses the body to its extreme … [and] requires rigorous physical training to reach the level of perfection.”
Interestingly, Sean, a classical composer, understands music as the isolation, rather than development, of particular moments in space and time. Although music is arguably the most fleeting art form—after all, one cannot preserve sound waves in space—Sean sees music as a powerful means of preservation. “Music is like freezing emotions,” he says. “You have a memory, often a feeling of affection for something, and music is a way to freeze that feeling.” These thoughts on music as a freezing rather than flowing art form provide a striking reinterpretation of Goethe’s description of architecture as a frozen form of music. Sean remarks that collaborative musicians today face interesting creative possibilities amidst an increasing trend in the arts toward visuality and physicality. “We have access to lots of visual technology and media, and we are becoming a much more visual culture,” he says, citing film as one of his points of increasing artistic interest and exploration.
The influence that visuality and space exhibit on Sean’s creative process and the influence that more immediately temporal art exhibits on Jiye’s artistic outlook reinforce how music and visual art may be missing links for each other. Visual art can lend to music its facility for multidimensional spatial capture, while music can lend to visual art a more perceptible dimension of time and therefore the possibility of truly temporal delivery in the final output. The result of combining these two art forms could be a demonstration of space working in tandem with time to create a single, multifaceted work—a genuine artistic space-time continuum.

To the editor:
I write to respond to recent assertions in the article "Harvard Should Rethink Being Boston Olympic Bid Booster" (February 19, 2015) about Harvard’s position with regard to the Boston 2024 Olympics.
As members of the Boston/Cambridge community, we were part of the preliminary conversations regarding the possible use of certain sites across the region for the 2024 Olympics. And we were briefed on some of the high-level initial concepts being discussed by organizers. However, no Harvard official saw the official bid documents before they were made generally public. Nor have we made any decisions or given any commitments regarding the possible use of any specific venues.
As we move into the first meaningful phase of discussion, President Faust made clear several weeks ago that, while we are open to discussing ways in which our involvement might contribute to this effort, any participation by Harvard must remain aligned with our academic mission and long-term planning goals. No Harvard facilities, institutional funds or fundraising efforts will be diverted away from those goals for purposes related to the Olympics. ​
It is for the region and its elected leaders to decide if the Olympics will or will not be beneficial to Boston. If that question is decided in the affirmative, we will play our part as good neighbors and strong supporters of the communities we inhabit. But we can and will do so only in ways that do not compromise our institutional priorities.

Sheepdom is a malady no school can cure. And yet there is much hullabaloo about William Deresiewicz’s hypothesis that “elite” schools are producing “excellent sheep”—that these schools are failing their students by producing graduates hustling to land prestigious jobs with nary a second thought. I agree with Deresiewicz that graduates of so-called elite schools are excellent sheep, and that sheepdom is undesirable—though more for its impact on society than for its effect on the individual—but disagree with him that the schools are responsible for their graduates being sheep, or that the schools are failing their students.
Elite schools are elite in large part because their graduates go on to become leaders of establishments—and establishments welcome the conformity that sheep provide. Nevertheless, a debate has raged over Deresiewicz’s hypothesis not only in college newspapers, such as The Harvard Crimson and The Stanford Daily, but also in national newspapers, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times.
Among others, Professor Steven Pinker of Harvard joined the fray, arguing in The New Republic that Harvard’s faculty and students are each doing a commendable job meeting their goals, and that the problem lies with Harvard’s admissions process. I agree. Students are admitted for their likelihood of becoming famous, in any sphere, and that is the goal they work toward while the faculty imparts to them the facility to think clearly and rationally.
Deresiewicz’s lamentation that elite schools are failing their students appears to rest on two assumptions: One, students admitted to elite schools are willing to be molded into “non-sheep”; and two, elite schools can mold students into non-sheep. I disagree with both assumptions.
As I argued in The Stanford Daily last summer, holistic admissions to elite schools are intellectually unmeritocratic. Elite schools seek to admit potential leaders while taking into account not only academic merit, but also alumni parents, extra-curricular activities, donations to the school, and family prominence. Consider how despite their dismal academic records, scions John F. Kennedy '40 and George W. Bush were admitted to Harvard and Yale, respectively. When what binds students at elite schools is their desire to lead—and to lead any existing establishment, one must first “fit into it”—why wouldn’t students at “elite” schools want to be “excellent sheep”?
Establishments abhor challenges. Socrates faced death for corrupting Athenian youth. Galileo was put under house arrest for challenging the Church's teaching that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Martin Luther King, Jr., was denigrated for criticizing the Vietnam War. Given the hardship non-sheep face, most students everywhere would rather be sheep than stick their necks out.
Furthermore, sheepdom is so ingrained in society that no school can mold students into non-sheep at its choosing. Consider how most individuals follow the religion of their parents without ever questioning that religion’s beliefs, or how “sheep” refuse to shed their sheepdom even when they can without any hardship. For instance, as Professor Geoffrey Stone of the University of Chicago argues, notwithstanding their lifetime appointments, our Supreme Court Justices often prejudge cases ideologically—based on their sheepdom—rather than judge them “in a principled, fair-minded, and objective manner.”
Then, it is unrealistic to expect any school to remedy sheepdom, as Deresiewicz expects elite schools to do: The best any school can do is equip students to recognize sheepdom. The initiative to reject sheepdom, and to accept any ensuing hardship, must come from the individual.
Although I agree with Deresiewicz that sheepdom is an individual failing, what concerns me more is that sheepdom impedes societal progress and undermines democracy.
If no one challenges “common wisdom,” how can we discover the error of our ways? It was sheepdom that caused Aristotle’s assertion that heavier objects fall faster to remain unchallenged for almost two thousand years, until Galileo decided to check it.
Sheepdom also robs group judgment of its advantage over individual judgment, which in turn robs democracy of its advantage over an autocracy. In 1907, Sir Francis Galton related in “Nature” how the “middlemost estimate” of about 800 individual guesses of the weight of a fat ox at a livestock fair was far more accurate than its any one single guess, even by a “cattle expert.” Subsequently, James Surowiecki pointed out in “The Wisdom of Crowds” that such superiority of group judgment relies on independent and diverse individual judgments—of which sheep provide neither. Then, group judgment by sheep—of the “weight of a fat ox”—is no better than individual judgment.
Then, whereas Deresiewicz is correct in identifying sheepdom as a problem, he is grazing on the wrong pasture: The problem is not with the education elite schools provide, but with the society that nurtures sheepdom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 5, 2015, at 10:47 p.m.
On February 24, the British newspaper The Guardian published a shocking article called “The disappeared: Chicago police detain Americans at abuse-laden 'black site.’” The Guardian's reports of significant abuses of justice merit significant public and media scrutiny, particularly given our current national focus on police brutality and abuse of power. Unfortunately, the American news media have lagged behind in reporting to this shocking story, to the detriment of the public and the rule of law.
Starting this February, The Guardian began to publish a series of investigative reports on torture, evidence planting, and other abuses in the Chicago Police Department.  Sources ranged from victims and social justice advocates to criminology professors and lawyers. Reports centered on former detective Richard Zuley, who allegedly applied these illegal methods over the course of a 30-year career in Chicago before taking over an interrogation position in Guantánamo Bay in 2003.
The Guardian’s reports then moved to Chicago’s Homan Square, where victims allege they were shackled for long stretches without food, denied the right to see a lawyer, and locked in isolation in order to bring about psychological distress. While legal experts debate whether The Guardian’s comparison to CIA “black sites” is apt, it seems likely that Homan Square and other CPD holding centers were sites of serious miscarriages of justice. In response to the story, Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin called the CPD’s techniques “Gestapo tactics” and called for the Justice Department to investigate.
The allegations of torture and mistreatment at Homan Square feed a larger, painful national conversation about abuses in law enforcement. Since the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, cases of lethal force by police have filled the news and sparked protests and community conversations across the country, as well as on this campus. In recent days, protestors–some associated with the Black Lives Matter movement and the hacker group Anonymous–have begun to congregate around Homan Square. Certain elected officials have also demanded answers.
Sadly, the city of Chicago has not been forthcoming. The CPD responded to The Guardian article in a written statement that called the reports of abuse “unequivocally false.” Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former Chief of Staff to President Obama who is currently locked in a tight race for re-election, has also denied the allegations, and his office is referring inquiries to the CPD statement. Given the severity of The Guardian’s allegations and the questions they raise about Chicago’s police force, Emanuel’s refusal to investigate is outrageous. Homan Square should matter to all Chicagoans, including and especially the Mayor.
The American news media also deserves a large share of the blame for the city’s lack of accountability. Emanuel felt he could dodge the story only because major news organizations have been disappointingly slow to report on the topic, particularly outside of Chicago. The Guardian’s reporting was quickly followed by Salon, The Atlantic’s online edition, and the New York Daily News. But other major big-city dailies, such as The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, have not reported anything at all.
If we want the full story, we will have to demand it—not only from the politicians, but from the press as well. The issues raised by Homan Square are too large to ignore, and deserve far more attention from the fourth estate.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 5, 2015
An earlier version of this editorial misspelled the name of the police warehouse complex Homan Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in August, I trudged onto campus with a backpack that was bigger than I was and with enough worries to fill it. Yet when I returned from my First-Year Outdoor Program trip a week later, I no longer felt lost and uncertain. I was ready to handle any challenge Harvard threw at me.
Now it’s early March. It’s cold outside, I’m behind on my coursework, and my job applications have been trickling back in the form of we-regret-to-inform-you letters. I have lost my FOP self. Every day, my roommates and I return to our suite and pile our coats, hats, and complaints on the couch. “This routine sucks.” “I’ll be happy when it gets a little warmer.”
Regardless of the month, there’s always a routine. But there was a time when the conditions around me didn’t preclude my happiness.
At my last FOP reunion, my leaders presented our group with a surprise: The letters we had written to our future selves during our trip up the Appalachian Trail.
Immediately, I was hit with the memories that were made alongside that letter. I had just gotten back from a quick trip to the emergency room for knee and ankle injuries. All of our clothing and gear had been completely soaked in a storm, and several of us were huddled under a tarp at our makeshift campsite. But we were a happy sort of tired. We laughed while we wrote.
So in the middle of Leverett Dining Hall, I looked down at my pen-stained note and read what I had hoped to take with me to Harvard:
1.“Stay positive when you and the people around you are struggling. Optimism is more powerful and inspiring than cynicism; remember the hike up Mount Cube.”
For the last half of that trek, I was angry. I was annoyed at the rocks I kept tripping over, annoyed at my obligation to finish the trail, and annoyed at myself. I remember hoping that someone would corroborate my sour mentality and give us an excuse to give up. I would have latched onto the smallest shred of negativity.
But no one gave one. Everyone kept breathing heavily and talking up the mountain. When we made it to the summit, I was confident that I would not be there if it weren’t for the optimism around me—so eventually I embraced it.
I can’t help but realize that my summit self did not make it to my second semester at Harvard. By whining so frequently about my essays and applications, am I keeping my friends from reaching their highest peaks? Maybe this habit of commiserating with one another simply breeds more misery.
2. “It’ll all work out. Knowing that and staying calm will keep you and those who love you happier than if you excessively worry.”
Being sad when you’re sad is normal and healthy. Lamenting every small life puzzle or problem is not. There will be a summit and then another mountain. On FOP, you take them in stride. The night in the pouring rain where you don’t reach your campsite and you’re tied to a tree (true story) will end. Your clothes will dry in the morning. You’ll get that p-set in on time, and then there will be another one.
At Harvard, it’s not too hard to keep these lessons in mind for a month or two, but soon, the woods get farther away. Memories of resilience are replaced with fears of punch season. Judgment-free zones are easily forgotten when your best friend is welcomed into a club that did not want you. Your blockmates will probably not chant, “I like myself., I’m worth a lot,” with you as you climb Widener steps.
So how do we bring our FOP selves all the way to March? I think the answer lies in a simple but brilliant piece of trail advice that I stole from my leader, Hannah.
3. “Know your brain space, and fill it with what you want to.”
So even in the dead of winter, when powdered hummus and headlamps are the last things on our minds (or even if they’ve never been on your mind), let’s be conscious about what we allow to fill our brain space. Let’s quit competing for who has too much work, be at peace with the knowledge that we will complete all of our tasks, and clear the winter clutter from our brain space. Leave room for FOP.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Luke Morgan-Scott ’18, a 5:50 a.m. alarm makes winter days stretch longer than most. By sunrise, Morgan-Scott, the only freshman to walk on to the varsity men’s swimming and diving team this year, hits the water at Blodgett Pool. But it’s only his first practice of the day.
“By the time you actually get to Annenberg, it’s 9:15 or so,” Morgan-Scott said. “You eat with the team right afterwards until you have class. Normally you eat with the team during lunch, then you’re back in the pool at 2:45. After that, you’re hungry, so you go to dinner with the team again right after.”
The expansion of practice hours into team meals and down time is a work week ritual familiar to many athletes at Harvard. And at just over four months, the swimming and diving team’s season is one of the longest in the school’s Division I program, which includes 42 varsity sports teams.
Morgan-Scott knew this when he decided midway through high school that he wanted swim in college. “It was the first time I’d truly dedicated myself to a sport,” he said later. Months of practice, weekend meets, and team-filled days since, the swim team is “the biggest part of my life here,” he said.
He is not alone in recognizing that walking on to a varsity team changes life at Harvard. The choice to walk on to a Harvard sports team has major social and academic implications that non-recruited students might not anticipate before they join, influencing the make-up of their social circles and their course schedules. Those factors often combine to define walk-on athletes’ time in college in a way they did not originally plan.
The Hours Add Up
In the most tangible of ways, the structural limitations on walk-on athletes are no different than those of any student who was recruited to play a varsity sport at Harvard. They share demanding practice schedules, trips to and from away games, and obligations to comply with NCAA regulations.
Yet the contrast freshman walk-ons find between Opening Days and life on a roster offers a unique lens through which to view the scheduling demands of varsity sports. It’s uncommon for students who were not formally recruited to walk on to a varsity sports team at Harvard, especially on major sports such as football and basketball. Out of 117 members of the varsity football team, only 2 walked on last fall, according to Tim Williamson, the director of communications at the Athletic Department.
Morgan Brown ’06, whose path to baseball team captain and two-time All-Ivy recognition began as a freshman walk-on, still remembers that transition.
“All of a sudden, if you make it, you have 3 hours of practice a day,” recalled Brown, who now serves as the director of baseball operations for the Athletic Department. “That’s if you draw it up on a calendar.”
But practices for most team sports tend to pile up—take the dual-practice schedule of the swimming and diving teams—so, as Brown added, “it’s very easy to get lunch with teammates on the way to practice, and have dinner on the way back. The time extends to half of your day.”
“And for walk-ons, you’re not always anticipating that,” he added.
To walk-ons who arrive at Harvard with a range of academic and extracurricular priorities beyond athletics, the adjustment may be more jarring than that for recruited athletes, some walk-ons say.
“It’s a really big difference,” said Lucy E. Rogers ’18, now on the women’s varsity heavyweight crew team. “I think a large part of it is that I didn’t come to college expecting to be an athlete, or expecting to row, and so I had this vision in my head of what I expected college to be like and didn’t expect to include athletics in it.”
Rogers, who may study Earth and Planetary Sciences or Statistics, also had a formidable schedule to contend with.
“It’s a little challenging because it’s everything that I wanted, plus four hours of athletics a day,” she said.
Rogers is not alone in sensing the structural impediments joining a team impose on that “vision” for a varied college schedule. Often, according to some College administrators, students must choose between sacrificing their other interests or committing to their team. But walk-ons often have had the chance to explore other facets of college prior to increasing their athletic commitments, perhaps more so than their recruited peers.
As Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said, “It might be that [walk-ons] didn’t step up as early in the process. Some of those folks may not have made the same sort of commitment early on and,” for example, “have found themselves able to have a wider network of friends.”
Community or ‘Cult?’
That network, however, often has trouble weathering the storm of team-filled days on end. Brandon N. Wachs ’18, a standout prospect from San Diego who never doubted his intention to play college baseball but was not a formal recruit, was more surprised by the social limitations created by joining Harvard’s baseball team than by any changes to his schedule. Walking on to a team, for many students, means socializing primarily with other athletes.
“I think it limits you from meeting other people that you would meet when you’re part of clubs or the paper or other things that you can do on campus,” Wachs said. “With sports, it really limits you to one extracurricular.”
Reasons both structural and cultural contribute to this limitation. For Wachs and baseball, for instance, near-weekly team mixers changed the color of his fall social experience. According to Wachs, between mixers, practice, and traveling with his teammates, he spends much of his time with the same group of student-athletes. “There’s a little bit of exclusiveness,” he said.
“In the most positive way you can say the word,” added Morgan-Scott about the swimming and diving team’s atmosphere, “it’s like a cult.”
Indeed, for Wachs and Morgan-Scott, their participation in a varsity athletic team offers them a unique and nearly constant source of friendships and social activity. After freshman orientation, Morgan-Scott said, “nightlife turned into team parties.” He and his teammates planned social events within the athlete community, such as mixers with other sports teams.
“You always had a group of friends that were pre-designated to be your friends and people to be very close to,” Morgan-Scott said.
To Wachs, it would be difficult to “match the camaraderie with teammates outside of sports.”
“I don’t know what you would do to duplicate that,” Wachs said. “That’s a big upside to playing a sport.”
Yet as Wachs and others note, the underside of camaraderie can be social limitation. Students say that walking on can prevent students from making friends outside of their team. Team members arrange regular meals together, and often meet up after practice hours to do schoolwork, sometimes leaving little time to branch out.
To Dingman, this sometimes translates into athletes participating less in residential life. “We see it in the Yard. We see athletes exempting themselves from study breaks, just not being full participants,” he said. “I think they miss out on some of the rich diversity of the place.”
“It just has to do with the fact that you are putting so much time into [your team], and a lot of [teammates] aren’t branching out,” Morgan-Scott said. “Those who are more introverted—for whom it’s harder to go out, or [who] have gotten so close to people on the team and forgot to branch out at the very beginning—realize that once [they] start leaving [the social circle], they don’t have anyone else.”
Still, some teams are not as constant of a source of social commitment. As a freshman fall walk-on to the women’s heavyweight crew team, Mary M. Carmack ’16 noticed that her social experience did not drastically change after she walked on. Crew team members have diverse interests outside rowing, according to Carmack, “and so for better or for worse, it means that it’s not necessarily your whole social life.”
The fact that walk-on athletes start out at Harvard without the same level of athletic commitment also helps them maintain a social life outside of their team, more so than recruits, said Wachs, who said he has friends outside the baseball team.
“I think that walking on helped me have more connections outside of sports,” Wachs said. “I kind of like that, because in high school I’ve always loved baseball, but I’ve never been like, ‘I’m just a baseball person.’”
Student-Athletes
Joining a varsity sports team also creates academic hurdles to which walk-ons, unlike their recruited peers, did not commit prior to coming to Harvard. While administrators have discussed changes that might make schedules more flexible, classes that meet in certain time windows—particularly in the afternoon—conflict with team practice schedules and thus pose challenges for students devoted to a varsity sport.
Dingman, for his part, expressed concern about this potential academic pitfall for athletes, noting that freshman seminars in the afternoons, in particularly, can be “hard” for freshman athletes to take.
Beyond purely structural limitations, Dingman poses another worry: He has observed that some freshman athletes—including walk-ons—choose their courses based on suggestions from their teammates rather than due to genuine interest in the subject.
“Sometimes the upperclassmen, thinking they’ll be helpful, suggest courses where they had the experience of being able to cut corners and felt that the load was lighter,” he said. “But that’s not particularly helpful [to their teammates].”
Still, some walk-on athletes say they have not encountered serious issues balancing the academic rigors of Harvard with their athletic schedules. It just requires more planning than it would have had they not chosen to walk on to a varsity team.
For Brown—who upon graduation traveled on a Michael C. Rockefeller Fellowship, which he helps administer at Harvard today—it was simple. “I loved school,” said Brown, who was also a finalist for the Rhodes Scholarship. “That was the reason I was here.”
Brown said his team had structural regulations in place—including team rules against meetings during shopping period and a ban on practices at certain hours during common class meeting times—to allow athletes more latitude for academic exploration.
Today, walk-on athletes on campus navigate such regulations to balance academics and their team, an effort that sets them apart from their non-varsity peers.
“Athletics makes you a workhorse academically,” Morgan-Scott said. “Academically, during the year you don’t notice it, but you don’t have nearly as much time as the people around you. You’ll leave practice, go to eat, work until you sleep. Crank it out, do what you need to do.”
Despite efforts to balance social and academic changes—however they may vary between individuals and teams—student-athletes walking on to a varsity sport necessarily make a team a large priority.
This choice does not bear lightly upon the fabric of Harvard residential communities that, according to the Harvard Athletic Department website, are composed of nearly 20% varsity athletes. But ultimately, as Brown puts it, walking on is an individual choice with individual social and academic consequences attached.
“How you divide up your time doing some of what you need to do, some of what you want to do, and finding the balance where you’re comfortable is such an individual thing,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—After a months-long process, eighteen jurors were selected in the Boston Marathon bombing trial of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Tuesday afternoon. Opening arguments for the trial will begin on Wednesday at 9 a.m.
Eight men and 10 women will determine the fate of Tsarnaev, who has plead not guilty to 30 charges in connection with bombings that killed three and injured more than 260 at the Boston Marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. Tsarnaev is also charged with the fatal shooting of MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013.
Seventeen of the counts carry the possibility of the death penalty. Tsarnaev attended Wednesday’s hearing at the Moakley Federal Courthouse in Boston and sat in the front of the courtroom, writing on a notepad and speaking with his legal team.
“He looked tired to me,” said Nancy Cederholm, who was cut from the jury in the last round.
The jurors selected—12 members who will take part in deliberations and six alternates—include a restaurant manager, an air traffic control operator, a social worker at the state Department of Developmentally Disabled, and an auditor who was recently laid off from his job. All of the jurors are white, with one man of Iranian descent, according to the Boston Globe.
At the final jury selection in the in the courthouse, the 18 jurors, out of a pool of 64, were selected within 40 minutes. Both the defense and prosecution were entitled to eliminate 23 potential jurors each without having to provide justification.
“It was nerve racking,” Cederholm said. “No, I didn’t want to get on the jury… I can go back and do my job.”
U.S. District Court Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. along with both prosecution and defense lawyers started to narrow a list of 1,373 prospective jurors in early January. Among a pool of 256 potential jurors selected for in-court interviews, at least two are affiliated with Harvard, according to the Boston Globe. While neither of those two individuals will serve on the jury, it remains unclear if any of the chosen jurors are affiliated with the University.
A couple of minutes before 1 p.m. on Tuesday, individuals who were not selected to serve on the jury filed out, some chattering amongst themselves about returning to work, others in silence.
Despite repeated requests by Tsarnaev’s defense team to relocate the trial outside of Boston, O’Toole maintained that the trial could be judged fairly in the district. Dismissed juror Hazel Graham said she thought the jurors could remain open in this case.
“I don’t know that a fair trial could have been held anywhere,” Graham said. “Perhaps the fairest trial would be here.”
The trial will be held in two phases: in the first, jurors will determine whether Tsarnaev is guilty of the charges held against him. If they convict him of charges that carry the death penalty, the jurors will then weigh whether he should receive life in prison without parole or the death penalty. O’Toole has said the trial could last through June.

The construction of Winthrop East, a planned five-story addition to Winthrop House’s Gore Hall, will likely begin prior to the summer of 2016, when renewal construction for the House is scheduled to begin, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith.
Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, which has been underway since 2012, previously included a planned one-year break in construction during the 2015-2016 academic year, ahead of Winthrop’s projected renovation. Administrators have previously said that they will use that time to evaluate the renovation of other Houses, including Quincy, Leverett, and Dunster. They have said that results may inform plans for Winthrop.
In an interview, Smith said administrators, including Winthrop’s House masters, are currently discussing whether some of the House’s residents will have to live in swing housing next year to accommodate construction on the addition.
“Because we’ve got a little time as we do this assessment, we can get started on the plans that are around for Winthrop East, for the new part,” Smith said. “That way, from Winthrop’s point of view, they will be in the construction phase for more than 15 months.”
Harvard will begin replacing windows and chimneys and make other minor alterations to Winthrop this June.

$14,000 worth of lab or research equipment was allegedly stolen from the New Research Building late last week, according to Harvard University Police Department logs.
The alleged theft was reported to the Harvard University Police Department last Thursday morning around 10:42 a.m. The New Research Building, which houses over 800 researchers, is located at Harvard Medical School’s Longwood Campus at 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur.
When contacted by The Crimson on March 1 regarding the alleged theft, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said that this case remains an “open investigation,” and that he would therefore be unable to comment on the matter. Subsequent attempts by The Crimson to contact security at the New Research Building resulted in deferrals back to HUPD.
When contacted by The Crimson, researchers from several labs located in the New Research Building appeared to be unaware that the theft had occurred.
At press time on Tuesday night, the exact equipment reportedly stolen and the lab from which the equipment was reportedly stolen were still not known.

The Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy awarded the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting to journalists from the Miami Herald for their series titled “Innocents Lost” on Tuesday night. The other journalists that were finalists for the award were also honored for their contributions to the field.
The event seeks to honor journalists who promote “effective and ethical conduct of government” by exposing both corrupt and commendable government performance. Finalists are awarded $10,000, and $25,000 is awarded to the winner.
“Each year the Goldsmith Prizes are an inspiration to all journalists, and this is a banner year for inspiration,” said Alex S. Jones, director of the Shorenstein Center, during the welcoming remarks. After 15 years of serving as the director of the Shorenstein Center, Jones is set to step down from his position on July 1.
“Innocents Lost” is a series published by the Miami Herald that documents the deaths of nearly 500 children in Florida and examines the Florida Department of Children and Families’ accountability for these deaths. This investigation led to changes in Florida’s child-welfare laws. Carol Marbin Miller and Audra D.S. Burch, two of the co-authors of the series, were present Tuesday night to receive the award.
“The [Miami Herald’s] stories and the database put a human face to those children. And it rocked Florida,’’ Jones said.
Marvin Kalb, founding director of the Shorenstein Center and veteran reporter for CBS News and NBC News, was awarded with the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at the event.
Kalb spoke highly of those being recognized for journalistic integrity. He was critical, however, of some modern journalistic trends.
“[Journalists] are pressured into quick decisions by the demand placed by technology,” said Kalb. “Little priority is preserved for careful consideration of honesty.”
Quoting American journalist Edward R. Murrow, Kalb cited how technology has failed its audience because of its “evidence of decadence, escapism and insulation from the realities of the world in which we live.”
Thomas E. Patterson, professor at the Kennedy School, awarded the Goldsmith Book Prize to Daniela Stockmann’s Media Commercialization and Authoritarian Rule in China and Andrew Pettegree’s The Invention of News: How the World Came to Know about Itself.
The other finalists for the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Journalism included reporters from the Boston Globe, the Post and Courier, National Public Radio and ProPublica, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 4, 2015, at 2:45 a.m.
Administrators are responding to an incident involving an explicit email message that was sent over a student-run Currier House mailing list Sunday.
In an email to Mather House residents Tuesday, Mather House Dean Luke Leafgren addressed the incident, which involved a roughly 1,700-word message sent over the “Currier Underground” listserv from the email account of a Currier senior. The email included explicit language and sexual references addressed to another student in the House whose account had recently sent a short message over the list referencing Currier’s Ten-Man suite. The senior lives in the Ten-Man, according to the senior’s email.
The senior’s message was shared over a number of student group email lists and was reprinted by outside blogs this week.
Currier House administrators did not respond to a request for comment on the incident, but a Tuesday email sent over Currier's announce list referenced "a widely distributed e-mail that reflects very poorly on our community."
Leafgren’s note to Mather residents referred to the email as “so obviously inappropriate and a violation of our community’s standards” and indicated that “[s]uch harms can have disciplinary consequences at Harvard” and “legal consequences beyond.”
The “administration is looking into this incident,” Leafgren wrote.
Interim Administrative Board Secretary Brett Flehinger declined to comment on whether the body had opened a case in response to the incident, citing Ad Board confidentiality policy.
The senior who sent the 1,700-word email did not respond to a request for comment. The student to whom the email was addressed, who is an active member of The Crimson’s staff, declined to comment.
In his note to students, Leafgren also suggested that students “use this moment as an opportunity to reflect on the ways our actions both in person and online create the environment we share.”
“It is instructive to observe how easy it is to harm others and ourselves through an email or other online activity, whether careless or malicious,” he wrote.
According to a Currier House student who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want his name associated with the incident, the “Currier Underground” list is administered by students, not House administrators.

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences responded largely positively both to legislation detailing the format of an affirmation of integrity as part of the College’s first-ever honor code and to a proposal to implement a new concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media at their second meeting of the semester Tuesday.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented on behalf of the Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana legislation for an affirmation of integrity statement undergraduates would make as part of the College’s new honor code. Under the legislation, students would be required to affirm their awareness of the honor code each time they register for the semester and would be unable to register should they not make that affirmation. Students would also be asked  to do so during final exams and on final papers and projects—including theses— and on other assignments at the discretion of the individual faculty member.
Harris emphasized that when affirming their awareness of the honor code, students would not be required to agree with the values of the honor code but simply acknowledge that they have read it.
Additionally, incoming freshmen would be required to write a paragraph about integrity after accepting their offer to Harvard.
Faculty voted in approval of the College’s first-ever honor code, in addition to the creation of a new student-faculty/administrator judicial board to hear cases regarding the violation of the honor code, in May 2014 after years of discussion and planning. The honor code will go into effect in the fall of 2015, according to Harris.
Smith noted that the Faculty Council voted 15-1 in favor of the legislation on the affirmation statement, with no abstentions. Economics professor Jeffrey A. Miron, who was opposed to the legislation, said that such a statement was “misguided and a poor use of our resources and energy.”
“I think asking students to sign their name every time stimulates cynicism,” Miron said.
Computer Science professor David J. Malan ’99 said that he too was skeptical of effects that the affirmation statement might have.
“What problem are we trying to solve or reduce?” he asked.
English professor Martin Puchner—who has spearheaded the effort to create the concentration in Theater, Dance, and Media—presented preliminary plans for the concentration to the Faculty and emphasized that necessary infrastructure, including performance space and faculty members with backgrounds in theater history, already exist at Harvard.
“Really the basic building blocks are here,” Puchner said.
He noted that the concentration would not be housed in a particular department but would draw faculty from different disciplines spanning from English to Music, and would not include separate tracks for dance or media.
Faculty will vote on the proposal at their next meeting on April 7, according to Harris, and should they approve of the new concentration, the concentration’s governing committee—the Standing Committee on Theater, Dance, and Media—would be created July 1.
In an interview after the meeting, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith cited the University’s strength in theater as well as the increasing use of varied media in theatrical performance as rationale for the lack of tracks.
“It has really always been thought of as an integral [area of study], not as things that we are stitching together,” Smith said.
Smith also noted that the $5 million in seed funds given for the concentration by Faust’s office will be used to finance concentrators’ productions, meet certain instructional needs, and hire administrative staff to run the concentration.
Multiple faculty members expressed support for the proposed concentration on behalf of their departments, including English department chair W. James Simpson, Music department chair Carol J. Oja, and Romance Languages and Literatures director of undergraduate studies Mary Gaylord.
Gaylord spoke on behalf of the  Department of Romance Languages and Literatures, saying that she hoped there would be opportunities to collaborate with the new concentration, should it be approved.
“We have multiplied circular efforts in the area of performance, and I hope that this will be a multilingual affair as well as a multi-medium,” Gaylord said.
At the beginning of the meeting, Faust asked to make a statement on Harvard’s role in Boston’s 2024 Olympic bid.
Saying that recent media attention has “often been misleading and outright inaccurate,” Faust reaffirmed that Harvard has “no commitments at this time or offered any proposals to the Olympics committee regarding our engagement” in the 2024 Olympic bid.
“Any Harvard involvement must remain aligned with our academic mission and our long term planning goals,” Faust said.

Harvard Law School students offered strategies and tips for navigating discussions about rape law in criminal law courses during a workshop event Tuesday. The discussion, hosted by the Women’s Law Association each year as criminal law courses begin covering rape and sexual assault, also explored what they described as myths associated with rape.
Unlike most other criminal law subjects, sexual assault is an issue that law students are more likely to have personally encountered and should be approached with more sensitivity, Lana R. Birbrair, a third-year law student who led the event, said.
“Whatever your views are of what rape law ought to be, the reason that we’re here is because it can be really hard to talk about it,” she said.
In particular, students discussed the possibility of emailing a professor in advance of a discussion on rape law to ask not to be called on during class. They also talked about supporting each other’s contributions during class.
Additionally, the student-led event covered a list of six misconceptions they said were often associated with rape and are present in some class discussions. In particular, students focused on the perception that women often lie about having been raped. Birbrair said that more time is spent discussing false accusations of rape than is spent discussing false accusations of other crimes.
“The way we talk about sexual assault and rape law is just not the same as the way we talk about fraud,” she said.
The workshop follows another recent Law School event on rape law. Last month, in a discussion sponsored by the Women’s Law Association and the Federalist Society, Law School professors Jeannie C. Suk and Andrew M. Crespo ’05 discussed whether or not the subject should even be taught in criminal law classes. While they said that some professors nationwide have stopped teaching rape law because of the sensitive nature of the topic, both Suk and Crespo ultimately advocated for its place in a criminal law curriculum.
Both events come during a time of contention among the Law School faculty about academic freedom and the discussion of subjects like rape law under Harvard’s new University-wide definition of sexual harassment. Law School professors have argued that Harvard’s policy provides insufficient provisions for protecting academic freedom when discussing sensitive topics, leaving professors and other students vulnerable to potential claims of verbal sexual harassment.

The annual overnight count of Cambridge’s homeless population took place last Thursday morning from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m., postponed nearly a month after the scheduled date for similar censuses across the nation due to extreme winter weather conditions, according to social service worker Mary Shannon Thomas.
Called “Point-in-Time,” the census counts both homeless individuals residing in shelters and those unsheltered. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development requires areas that receive funding to conduct the census annually during the last week of January.
For the first time in Cambridge, volunteers conducting the census underwent formalized training, said Thomas, who specializes in homelessness cases. She added that a need to maintain the “safety and dignity of the volunteers,” prompted the training.
However, the February snowfall not only postponed the census but hindered volunteers from fully covering the local county.
“I think it would be very fair to say that the snow complicated our efforts because there were areas we couldn’t get to because of the accumulation of snow,” Thomas said.
The results of the annual count will be released in the upcoming weeks. According to the census data from earlier years, Cambridge has seen a growing number of homeless people, both sheltered and unsheltered. In 2013, the count was at 537 homeless people, which increased to 551 in 2014.
Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said that he remained hopeful for the future of the homeless community in Cambridge.
“Prior federal programs were in some senses unrealistic and certainly did not end homelessness,” Mazen said. “We can [now] think realistically how to approach this problem and what we are doing as a city.”

­Last weekend was a big one for the Harvard men and women’s track and field teams, as the women provided a performance to remember, taking home a third straight Ivy League title, while the men gritted out a fifth-place finish at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
The competition proved to be fruitful for various individual Crimson athletes as well, as several took the stage by storm and left their respective marks on the meet.
Competing in their last rendition of the Ancient Eight Championships, multiple Harvard seniors went out triumphant, claiming gold in their individual events.
Among those seniors was men’s co-captain Jarvis Harris. The Ama, La., native won the 60-meter hurdle race with a 7.94 second finish, just a day after running a school-record 7.93 during the preliminaries.
The senior had broken the Crimson record once this season, a feat almost two years in the making. After first claiming the record as a sophomore, Harris was unable to improve the record as a junior.
Coming back from an injury this past November, the senior opened his last indoor season by breaking the record, a feat which he attributes to technical improvements on his race.
“One part of my race which has got significantly better is my start,” Harris said. “Doing some readjustments…I was able to find the perfect set up to push out very well and get me into the race.”
Harris wasn’t the only Harvard senior to shine, as classmate Danielle Barbian ended her indoor career on a high note as well. Competing in front of family and friends sporting “Team Barbian” apparel, the Sussex, Wis., native didn’t disappoint.
The success started in the preliminaries, where the senior broke her own meet record with a 7.43 second mark in the 60-meter dash. The next day, Barbian improved on that performance, claiming the title by breaking her Ivy League record with a 7.40 performance. The day, however, didn’t end there for the senior.
Barbian continued in the 200-meter race, where the senior sprinted to a 24.03 second finish in the first finals heat, establishing herself as the leader before being forced to play the waiting game for one more heat.
Ultimately, Columbia’s Ashley Cunningham fell short of catching Barbian, clocking in at 24.09 in the second heat. The result handed the Harvard sprinter her second title of the day.The result was a surprise to the senior, who before this year had struggled with the race, and helped her ultimately take home the Track Athlete of the Meet award.
“I was definitely shocked,” Barbian said. “I got to about 150 meters—that’s normally when you feel the girls—and I didn’t feel any of them. I [thought] ‘wow, this is happening.’”
The accolades were not just limited to sprinters, as women’s co-captain Erika Veidis helped clinch the women’s title with her performances in the 80-meter run and 4 x 880-yard relay.
Despite injuries which had left her out of the HYP Meet two weeks prior, the senior competed in the 800-meter run, one of the most anticipated events of the meet, as Veidis and Princeton’s Cecilia Barowski both came in ranked in the top 30 in the nation.
The race proved to be a tight one, with Veidis falling just short, placing second with a time of 2 minutes, 7.53 seconds, less than a second behind Barowski. While Barowski took home the crown in the 800, Veidis would end up with the last laugh.
Both competitors competed in the 4 x 880-yard relay, but Veidis was the one standing on top of the podium with her teammates. She ran the third leg of the relay in a time of 2:10.97, the fastest time of the 32 competitors, including Barowski. The race ultimately clinched the title for Harvard, with the Sparta, N.J., native contributing 18 points for the Crimson.
With the indoor season behind her, Veidis hopes to return to full health in preparation for the outdoor season and the future.
“I want to be able to race for the win regardless of how the race plays out,” Veidis said. “I want to get really strong this outdoor [season].... Hopefully, that will bode well for next year, because I hope to continue running.”
The seniors weren’t the only ones with outstanding performances.  Sophomore Nikki Okwelogu continued to stake her claim as the best shot putter in Ivy League history, winning the event with an Ancient Eight-record 17.12 meter throw.
The mark was the first throw over 17 meters in conference history and placed the Fresno, Calif., native at ninth in the nation, putting her in prime position to contend at  NCAA nationals later in the season. The sophomore was awarded the Field Athlete of the Meet award.
Okwelogu has had a season to remember, placing as the highest collegiate competitor in all six competitions she has partaken in this season while rewriting the Ivy record books three weeks in a row.
The sophomore is confident that she can improve even further on what she’s accomplished.
“I’ve been having really good practices, really consistent,” Okwelogu said. “If I can hold it, keep my health and routine up, there’s no reason I can’t do it again.”
With Heps now behind them, the Harvard athletes now turn to the IC4A Championships, NCAA Nationals, and the outdoor season, hoping to leave their mark on those competitions as well. However, there is little doubt that the special performances of these individuals made the competition a memorable one for the Crimson.

The score was tied at 9-9 when the Harvard men’s lacrosse team entered the fourth quarter in a game against Quinnipiac Tuesday evening.
However, the Crimson (2-1) ran away at the end by scoring five consecutive goals within three minutes, beating the Bobcats by a five-goal margin, 17-12.
Harvard emerged in the fourth quarter with new energy and aggression, as sophomore Austin Williams scored the second goal of the quarter directly from the face-off, notching his first goal of the season.
This drive was matched by his fellow teammates who ended any hope of a Quinnipiac comeback by scoring three more goals to finish the game with a tally of eight goals in the final quarter.
“We realized we had to work for it,” junior midfielder and co-captain Sean Mahon said. “We had to lock it down and put the full effort in, and played a lot better.”
The Crimson, ranked No. 13/16 nationally, entered the game owning a 6-0 record historically against the Bobcats and was 3-0 on its home turf in Cambridge.
It seemed like history would repeat itself easily when junior midfielder Ian Ardrey scored two goals early, assisted by junior attackman Devin Dwyer. This prompted a succession of two more from the junior attackman Will Walker and junior midfielder Sean McDonagh, leaving Harvard up, 4-1, after 10 minutes.
But the Crimson would not be able to pull away. Despite Harvard’s taking almost twice as many shots at goal and winning more groundballs than the Bobcats in both the first and second quarter, it wasn’t enough to finish off the Bobcats.
Quinnipiac responded by locking in two more goals in the first quarter and outscoring the Crimson 3-1 in the second, leaving Harvard trailing, 6-5, at halftime. The sudden resurgence by Quinnipiac served as a wake up call for the Crimson.
“We came out really hot, and I think we just felt that it was going to keep happening,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “It’s a good lesson that you have to earn everything and go out and take it. It’s not going to be a 4-1 run each time.”
The Crimson returned from halftime a completely different team, first catching up to the Bobcats by outscoring them 4-3 in the third quarter and then leaving Quinnipiac far behind with its performance in the fourth.
The fourth quarter streak was highlighted by goals from Walker, junior attackman Deke Burns, freshman midfielder Joe Lang, McDonagh, and Dwyer. Dwyer would finish the game with one goal, five assists and the highest point total for Harvard. The sophomore led the squad with 47 points last season, and has already racked up 14 in the Crimson’s first three contests of the year.
“We were moving the ball, spinning the ball, and not taking the first shot because we...were expecting [the shot to be] covered,” Mahon said.  “But once we started taking…the first [shot] right away, we started scoring a lot more.”
Guided by its newfound aggressiveness on offense, the Crimson proceeded to see many more of its shots at goal find the back of the net. Harvard scored on eight-of-12 shots made on goal in the fourth quarter compared to only one-of-10 in the second.
“At halftime, we made a couple of adjustments and the guys really adjusted,’” Wojcik said. “I really felt like ‘enough’s enough here.’ I said that it was crunch time and we really needed to start playing our brand of lacrosse. It wasn’t a schematic change, it was simply a maturation of the team. It was important for us to play well in that fourth quarter as this past Saturday we got outplayed by Duke in that fourth quarter,”
This change was embodied by the performance of Lang, who scored three times and made two assists in the second half.
“He was a real kind of burst of energy,” Wojcik said. “He made some key plays.”
Despite having a shaky start, Harvard gained both a win and a lesson that it will take with it for the rest of the season.
“We learned a lot from it,” said Dwyer. “At any other game we play this year, we’re definitely not going to take any team for granted.”

Harvard (1-1, 0-0 Ivy) fell to No. 8 Virginia (3-2, 0-1 ACC) in Charlottesville, Va., on Tuesday night. Although the teams headed into halftime tied, 5-5, the Cavaliers outscored the Crimson 8-4 in the second frame to clinch the victory, 13-9.
During the opening minutes of both halves, Harvard came out strong, putting numbers on the board before the Virginia offense could execute. Within the first three minutes of the beginning frame, freshman midfield Julia Glynn found the net for her second goal of the seasonafter a feed from sophomore attack Megan Hennessey. Sophomore attack Marisa Romeo, who led the team with three goals, then tallied an unassisted score for the Crimson and gave the team to a two-point lead.
Harvard had another opening surge in the second frame, holding a lead for 12 minutes after putting up three consecutive goals within the first few minutes. The Cavaliers then answered with three goals of their own, tying the score at 8-8 midway through the half.
“Overall, I was really proud of the way our team played,” junior co-captain Tory Waldstein said. “We proved that we belong on the same field as a top ten team like UVA. I thought our attack was really composed, and our defense made them work for a lot of their goals.”
After two alternating goals led to another deadlock at 9-9, the Virginia defense held the Crimson scoreless for the duration of the match while netting four more goals for the win. The Harvard offense went zero-for-five in free position opportunities, and the Cavaliers edged out the Crimson, 13-11, in draw controls, 11-7 in ground balls, and forced seven Harvard turnovers.
“Towards the end I think we got a little tired and made a couple mistakes that let them pull ahead,” Waldstein said. “Hopefully we will get another shot at them in NCAAs.”
Hennessey led the Crimson in assists, caused turnovers, and ground balls with two apiece. Her registered total three points came in crucial moments for the Crimson. She participated in both opening goals in each period and tallied an assist to sophomore midfield Maeve McMahon to tie the game, 5-5, heading into halftime.
Freshman midfield Nekele McCall recorded her first career point after taking advantage of a pass from captain junior midfield Audrey Todd. Her goal was the ninth and final goal for the Crimson.
“Tough loss yesterday, but it is still really early in the season,” said junior co-captain and goalie Kelly Weis. “We have time to improve.”
Virginia’s junior attack Kelly Boyd led both teams with four goals and three ground balls. Three of her four goals came in the final six minutes of the matchup.
“We are a young team,” Weis said. “So being able to go toe-to-toe with a top 10 team like UVA gives us some confidence moving forward this season.”
Weis recorded eight saves for Harvard, and the Crimson defense executed eight of nine clears.

“You must be so uncomfortable: you’re on a date, and your date starts undressing…”
Ahh, if I had a dollar for every time a date had said this to me. I’d only be a dollar richer, but I could probably get a bar of chocolate at CVS.
Luckily, Datamatch didn’t actually set me up with a male stripper, and Alexander J. Rohe ‘17 was just making a joke while he took off his sweater.
But let’s rewind for a second– back to the Monday after Valentine’s Day, when the Flyby writers decided that we all collectively would ask out our Datamatches.  My top match politely turned me down, probably because he was intimidated by my beauty, and definitely not because he didn’t want to be written about online. So naturally, I turned to the desperate act of Facebook stalking the rest of my matches. It was at this point that I realized that some of my friends actually knew these guys. Perfect.
So, like all great romances, my Datamatch date was orchestrated through texts with a mutual friend:
“okay, so i write for flyby and all the staff writers are trying to go on dates…so we can write about the ~datamatch experience~…i saw you were a mutual friend and i was just wondering if you knew him well enough to ask him if he would be willing to partake”
#desperate. But what’s more attractive than an inability to communicate effectively without emoticons?
After a couple of cancelled dates (one thing we have in common: we’re both super busy/did not know our schedules when trying to pick a time!) we finally agreed to meet at Clover for dinner.

Taking some advice on timing from my good friend and Crimson Staff Writer Ignacio Sabate ’18, I rolled up fashionably late. My date was already there. We ordered and made small talk while trying to listen for our names.
He ordered the rosemary fries. I ate the rosemary fries.
I had a good time talking to Alex, and we had a decent amount in common, like our music tastes and the fact that we both have done scientific research.
Admittedly, we’re no Chuck and Blair, no Rachel and Ross, no Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. And while we weren’t exactly ready to jump into the 36 questions to make us fall in love, I did enjoy getting to know him. Datamatch, unfortunately, isn’t magic, but it’s at least a conversation starter.
And hey, I got back to my dorm and my entire entryway was asking about my date (I conveniently had forgotten to mention that it was for an assignment…but a fake social life is better than none, right?) And I’ll take any excuse to not have to eat at Annenberg– even if I have to endure a striptease or two.
