After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the start of the new school year, the days have become just a bit breezier, the libraries have found new residents, and the Yard is once again teeming with tourists and wide-eyed first years. Both excitement and anxiety have swept over the student body as many students come prepared to conquer their school year resolutions. We all come in with vastly different goals for our personal paths for success at Harvard, but we would encourage you to look beyond your professional goals and academic anxieties. We hope you will stay informed on the issues that affect people beyond the Harvard community while continuing to prioritize your friendships and your well-being.
To stay true to the mission of Harvard College and become “citizen-leaders for our society,” students must  stay educated about the world beyond Harvard. Our Harvard bubble is permeable to the many current events and political decisions that affect our diverse student body. Be aware of the ways that discourse affects your peers on campus.
That said, the Harvard bubble can seem inescapable at times. We're very often surrounded by people who agree with us, whether it be politically or culturally. It creates a tendency to be inattentive to perspectives people hold outside of our gates. To better engage in difficult discussions, seek out opinions that challenge your perspective this year.
With this in mind, we hope that all of you will make, or continue to work to make, Harvard your home. Difficult discussions have a place here, but so does every  student, regardless of background. To those who may have an easier time settling into this place of privilege than others, we encourage you to work to make Harvard a better home for all.
A simple way to make this happen is to be proactive in our kindness. Offer help even when someone does not ask for it, in both subtle and large gestures. Everyone is incredibly busy, but even a simple “How are you doing?” or “How can I help?” can go a long way in showing someone you care. In the same vein, do not be afraid to receive kindness or ask for help when you need it.
These acts of respect will help us to better connect with those around us, be it blockmates or people you meet for the first time in section this year. It is all too easy to get caught up in academics and extracurriculars, but do not lose yourself and the relationships you make at Harvard. The friendships you make are the things that will last you a lifetime, not your problem set grade.
Perhaps most importantly, take ownership of your life here. Harvard is replete with wonderful opportunities (sometimes too many!) and amazing people. Pursue your passions, and prioritize your happiness. Don’t stress too much about what others are doing. Sometimes things will not go your way, and sometimes things are just out of your control—but that’s life.
Whether this fall semester is your your first (welcome, Class of 2021!), last (almost there, seniors!), or somewhere in between, we wish all of you a smooth start to your year. Have fun, make the best of it, and welcome back to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is part three in a series of op-eds by members of Harvard student groups welcoming the Class of 2021 to campus.
To the Class of 2021:
The Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition welcomes you to a new and exciting phase of your life. Away from the familiar communities you call home, this may be the first time you will need to actively think about who you are in the broader context of the world, a process that will necessarily include conversations about race and ethnicity.
As the academic year starts in earnest and the humid summer camp memories of Opening Days gradually fade, you and other first years will be left with the lingering promise that “Community Conversations” are just a primer for the many transformative conversations you will have in the years to come. The intention and thought that the administration has put into the “Community Conversations” programming is evident with the inclusion of foundational works by scholars and writers like W.E.B. Du Bois and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. However, as was discussed in a 2016 town hall, these types of incisive discussions and reflections on issues of race and ethnicity are only formally initiated once in a student’s academic tenure at Harvard.
Institutionally, Harvard does not have dedicated space for continuing these conversations, a space typically provided by a program for Ethnic Studies.
As Becina J. Ganther ’20, a Crimson editorial editor, writes in her work “Becoming,” “The world needs more stories, more experiences, more perspectives. That’s how we learn about ourselves and, equally importantly, those around us. And that’s also how we learn about the ways that oppressive structures such as racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, and xenophobia advantage certain people over others.”
At the heart of this quote is an endorsement for Ethnic Studies: the critical examinations of power and privilege necessary for understanding the complex racial landscape of our communities in the US and the implications of that racial landscape on the rest of the world. You are all coming from different walks of life for an education that should ultimately prepare you to walk out of these gates once more.
Professor Gary Y. Okihiro, founding director of Columbia’s Center for the Study of Ethnicity and Race, confirms that “Ethnic Studies is not identity politics, multiculturalism, or an intellectual form of promoting affirmative action for people of color,” a conflation which “trivialize[s] the political claims of the discipline, reducing the analysis of power relations and their interventions.” Particularly in our current political climate, understandings of the oppressive structures which brought us to this moment are critical in the classroom and beyond.
Generations of Harvard students and faculty before you have long been committed to moving past “Community Conversations” as a starting point, including 11 proposals for Ethnic Studies at Harvard in the last 45 years. You are part of a long legacy of student action, and the need for thoughtful conversation about race and ethnicity is greater now than it has ever been before. This is a moment for change. In a political climate that encourages ignorance and bigotry, the choice to take ownership over your education is revolutionary, whether by formally pursuing and advocating for Ethnic Studies, taking classes by your excellent faculty of color, attending student-led teach-ins, or hosting educational/political events with your cultural organizations.
Finally, you are certainly not alone in pursuit of your education. The Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights has long supported students pursuing Ethnic Studies at Harvard, providing a secondary field for undergraduates, structured programming such as their Student Advisor Council, and working groups in Asian American and Latina/o Studies for faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. Furthermore, the Ethnic Studies track new to History & Literature this year provides an exciting opportunity for students to pursue Ethnic Studies in a concentration and also provides another formal pathway for bringing Ethnic Studies faculty to our campus.
The Ethnic Studies Coalition will continue to advocate for a robust and interdisciplinary Ethnic Studies program at Harvard, with the goal of upholding that lofty promise of continuing these crucial conversations in our communities and beyond.
Sally Chen ’19, a co-coordinator of the Task Force for Asian and Pacific American Studies and an inactive Crimson editor, is a joint concentrator in History & Literature and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality in Winthrop House. Andrew Perez ’20 lives in Mather House. Anwar Omeish ’19 is a Social Studies Concentrator in Lowell House. They write on behalf of the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What’s your favorite color? If you like blue, you’re in good company. But, if you like yellow, you won’t find many others who share your preference. A 2011 study found that yellow is the least liked color, and only 5 percent of people have yellow as their favorite color. So, are people who like yellow a minority?
Well, yes and no. Numerically, they are a minority. After all, there aren’t many of them. But they aren’t a minority in the same way that we think of people of color or LGBTQ+ people as minorities.
Are women minorities?
If we’re looking purely at numbers, I’m not sure. The 2010 census states that 50.8 percent of Americans are female, but that’s inaccurate since much of the data is based on gender assigned at birth rather than actual gender. But even if we pretend that women are indeed the numerical majority, the question still stands: Are women minorities?
And that’s how the premise of solely using numbers and population percentages to determine minority status falls apart. Having fewer numbers doesn’t directly translate to less power, and having greater numbers doesn’t directly translate to greater power. Liking the color yellow does not lead to oppression, and being a woman or being a person of color in a majority nonwhite class does not lead to privilege.
Yes, it’s a problem if an institution is completely comprised of cis straight able-bodied white men. And yes, it is better to include more women, LGBTQ+ people, people of color, and people with disabilities. But that’s only part of the puzzle. Even if there are more women than men, or more people of color than white people, or more LGBTQ+ people than cis straight people, or more people with disabilities than able-bodied people, the oppressive structures that marginalize women, people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities won’t just magically disappear.
Having more people of color in a Harvard class doesn’t change the fact that 81 percent of faculty members are white, or that only 25 percent of Counseling and Mental Health Services clinicians are people of color.
There might be more women in America, but that doesn’t change the fact that only 21 percent of the US Senate is comprised of women, or that only 6.4 percent of Fortune 500 companies are run by women. Oh, and 0 percent of US presidents have been women. And even if more women attained positions of power, they still face many other barriers. Assertive women are called “bossy”, women are slut-shamed for their clothing choices, and women are expected to be responsible for most of the housework and childrearing while advancing in their career. Now, these problems aren’t specific to just women—certainly, people of all genders can face these issues. But, historically and presently, these social norms and expectations harm women more than men in ways that have been systematically set in place by power structures.
Diversity initiatives that purely focus on increasing the number of people from oppressed groups rather than working to change the system that creates oppression in the first place are just putting a band-aid on a gushing wound.
The overemphasis of the concept of majority versus minority could help explain why we see some pushback from privileged groups on women’s schools and historically black colleges and universities. Some cry reverse sexism or reverse racism, claiming that these schools create an unfair environment where men or white people are suddenly in the minority. But they forget that the rest of the world outside of these institutions is dominated by men and white people. And they forget that the reason why many of these institutions exist in the first place is because women and people of color were denied access to existing schools. And they forget that even today, most schools that are supposedly co-ed and racially integrated are still predominantly run by white men and cater to the needs of white male students. It’s easy to forget about power structures when looking solely at numbers supports a privileged worldview.
Speaking solely in terms of majority versus minority also ignores intersectionality. For example, 4.1 percent of Americans are LGBTQ+, and 13.3 percent of Americans are black. Thus, LGBTQ+ people and black people are numerical minorities and structurally oppressed groups. But just looking at these numbers ignores the fact that there are black LGBTQ+ people who face both queerphobia and racism. Moreover, the simple categorization of LGBTQ+ people as minorities because there aren’t many of us ignores the power structures that many LGBTQ+ people benefit from and perpetuate. A great example of this is white queer men perpetuating racism and misogyny by appropriating culture from black women. It’s not enough to simply say you’re a minority—we need to all recognize that being oppressed from one power structure doesn’t prevent us from oppressing others in different power structures. Being a minority doesn’t absolve anyone of problematic behavior.
I would love to see the language we use to shift away from just majority versus minority. While some people understand the majority versus minority dynamic to be shorthand for the complex ways we all interact with intersectional power structures, too many are missing the point.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four days after the Class of 2021 gathered in Tercentenary Theatre for a class-wide welcome to campus, hundreds of first-year students filled Memorial Church Saturday for Harvard’s first-ever Black Convocation.
The event, hosted by the Black Students Association, was attended by freshmen, upperclassmen, graduate students, and faculty alike. Following a performance by the Kuumba Singers, black upperclassmen and Lawrence D. Bobo—chair of the African and African American Studies departmentdelivered remarks.
Speakers discussed challenges that came with being black at Harvard, and welcomed freshmen from similar backgrounds to campus.
Hakeem O. I. Angulu ’20, for example, told freshmen to celebrate their place at Harvard.
“I know that my presence on this campus and your presence on this campus is not a mistake. It is a victory. It is a victory over the systems that have kept you, I, and people that look like us down for so long,” he said.
Kacey E. Gill ’20, an intern at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, paid homage to former Foundation director S. Allen Counter, who passed away in July.
“Dr. Counter and I didn’t always agree on how to best support students of color, but what we did agree on and what his actions and his leadership always reminded me of was that this work has to be grounded in love for everyone always,” Gill said.
Freshmen who attended said they found the event to be a sign of support.
“Even though there aren’t people with names like mine etched into the wall, there’s not photos of people that look like me in the halls, I have a community nevertheless and I will be supported no matter how outside I may feel,” Priscilla S. Samey ’21 said.
The majority of the attendees adhered to the all-white dress code, which event organizer Najya Williams ’20 set in place.
“I just envisioned all of us coming together in varying shades of white, in different hues, just coming together, making that type of statement I felt would be really cool,” Williams said.
She said she decided to encourage the dress code in order to “show the community, show the incoming students, show even Harvard on a larger scale that we take up space as people of color. We belong on this campus. We have a purpose. We can look beautiful.”
Williams said she was pleased at the event’s turnout, and she hopes it will signal to freshmen that they belong at Harvard.
“When I came to Harvard last year, I didn’t really feel that... black students were made to feel as welcome as they should, so it really important that we had events that made sure that was the case,” she said. “It all came together so beautifully today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, students concentrating in History and Literature can take a course on fashion and slavery—and receive credit toward the concentration’s newly-created Ethnic Studies track.
The course’s professor, lecturer Jonathan M. Square, is one of a new set of History and Literature instructors who will be teaching courses in the concentration’s Ethnic Studies field, one of seven “focus fields” available to students studying Harvard’s honors humanities concentration. According to an email sent to concentrators when the field was announced in April, the Ethnic Studies track examines how “slavery, diaspora, migration, and colonialism” shape cultural and social movements.
Square, who has an academic background in both Latin America and the fashion industry, said the History and Literature committee has been “welcoming.”
“That’s one thing I’m really excited about being in the department. In the past, at different institutions, I’ve gotten pushback on studying the topic,” he said. “Hist and Lit was very welcoming and really encouraged my creativity as a scholar.”
The University has long had a fraught relationship, though, with scholars and activists who have for decades pushed for more comprehensive ethnic studies offerings, including in Latino and Asian American studies.
“I was also a Harvard undergraduate before I started teaching here,” said Marina S. Magloire ’11, a new  History and Literature lecturer who is teaching a class on the African diaspora. “At the time, Ethnic Studies was something students were campaigning for not in History and Literature, but for the wider university.”
Last December, a group of students circulated a petition calling on Harvard to establish an Ethnic Studies department, create a center for research in the field, and hire more faculty. And though some advocates for the field say the History and Literature is a step in the right direction, some say they would like to see even more offerings in the field: Sally Chen ’19, a History and Literature concentrator and ethnic studies activist, said she was disappointed that no dedicated courses in Asian American Studies were being offered this fall.
Genesis De Los Santos ’19, a History and Literature concentrator focusing in the new field, said she hopes the Ethnic Studies track will eventually consolidate into its own department.
“It deserves its own department,” De Los Santos said. “There aren't that many courses that necessarily are solely offered by the History and Literature department. A lot of the ways that you can complete your requirement are through the African and African American Studies department, the History department or the English department.”
Students and faculty said the courses labeled as ethnic studies have, anecdotally, popular during the College’s course shopping week. Newly-hired History and Literature lecturer Emily K. Pope-Obeda, who is teaching an introductory course on the history of deportation in the United States, said that her first class meeting garnered a lot of interest.
“I think [Hist and Lit] is really responding to a lot of student interest in learning about these subjects,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the storm water inched higher, eventually engulfing her neighborhood and seeping into her home, Priya Amin ’19 was struggling to find an internet connection to email professors about classes. Outside, helicopters whirred, evacuating her neighbors as Hurricane Harvey smashed into southeast Texas.
“I was responsible for emailing professors and letting them know that I want to get in their classes and filling out application forms while I don't have electricity for the most part,” Amin said.
A native of Port Arthur, Texas, Amin—who was stranded in her home for five days with intermittent power and water—was one of several Harvard students who saw their neighborhoods flooded and struggled to arrive on campus for the start of the semester. The nation’s first major hurricane in 12 years, Harvey has already caused an estimated $150 billion in damages and claimed over 60 lives as it tore through Houston and communities across south Texas.
Between delayed flights, damaged property, and struggling family members, the storm has taken a toll on many Harvard students from the region.
After originally scheduling a flight for August 26, Bushra Hamid ’20 decided to reschedule her flight at the last minute in anticipation of the storm.
“I had to pack [in] five hours and leave. I couldn't say bye to my friends or family,” Hamid said. “I had to escape.”
Many students who did make it on campus before the storm hit were still affected by news of their family and friends back home. Eric F. Gao ’20 said he called home after he arrived on campus, only to find out the first floor of his house was flooded. Due to the floodwaters, his family will have to tear out drywall and throw away ruined furniture.
“Emotionally for me it was difficult because I had to leave home in a hurry, and I was thinking about the furniture and valuables and even my home, that it would be completely different the next time I saw it,” Gao said. “I wanted to be back in Houston with my family to help.”
Many affected students said that their peers and advisors reached out in support. Karen L. Yang ’20 said she and her family braved high floodwaters as they drove more than a hundred miles so she could catch a plane to campus. She said the Winthrop Faculty Deans were “super supportive,” encouraging her and other Texans to take care of their affairs at home before worrying about school.
On campus, the Harvard College Texas Club has led efforts to fundraise for victims of the storm. Friday night, dozens of students attended a candlelight vigil held by the club in support of those who had been affected by the storm.
One of the organizers and speakers at the vigil, Sara S. Surani ’18, cited her friends as motivation for holding the event. A resident of Corpus Christi, Surani was in constant communication with her friends who had been directly impacted by the hurricane.
“I was probably texting and calling upwards of twenty people every hour just to make sure they were alive, and every time I wouldn’t hear back I would be terrified that they didn’t make it or that they were trying to get out of their house,” Surani said.
According to Trey Sexton ’19, co-president of the Texas Club, the organization plans to facilitate Harvey relief donations in the Science Center from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. through Thursday of this week and is working with the Phillips Brooks House Association to collect in-kind donations for victims.
Many of the affected students stressed the importance of continual donations. Due to the high amount of damage caused by floodwater, restoration efforts will likely take years, according to Amin.
“Once the news stops covering it, people forget about it. But it’s not over,” said Amin.

As College administrators move to stem the rapid proliferation of student organizations on campus, thousands of students flocked to the Quad Friday for the annual showcase of Harvard's hundreds of undergraduate groups—the Student Involvement Fair.
Eager first-year students navigated the crowded lawn with handfuls of flyers, while upperclassmen jostled in front of tables passing out sweets and sweet-talking students into joining their clubs. Dining halls closed for the College-wide affair and Harvard University Dining Services served their annual “Taste of Boston” themed dinner on the Quad Lawn.
Alexander R. Miller, associate dean for student engagement, said he was “excited” about the annual fair and praised the high turnout. Miller works in the College’s Office of Student Life, which hosts the activities fair.
With 442 student organizations officially recognized by Harvard College, however, Amelia A. McLaughlin ’21 said she felt a bit “overwhelmed” by the sheer number of activities available and had trouble navigating the plethora of booths.
“I think that it was a bit confusing to find the clubs,” McLaughlin said. “There should definitely be a bit more maps around the lawn rather than a just few big ones.”
Ethan Harradine ’21, who is originally from the United Kingdom, said the event felt like being in an “American college movie.”
“You walk in and there’s tons of different activities and things to look at,” Harradine said. “It’s been really cool so far to see the diversity which there is here at Harvard and what you can do during your time here.”
While students praised the myriad offerings at the activities fair, College administrators have expressed concerns in recent years about the priority that many students place on extracurriculars—often at the expense of academics.
The Office for Student Life last year elected to suspend and revise the recognition process for new clubs, citing concerns that new student groups tended to have short lifespans and overlap with each other. No new student organization has been approved since September 2016.
Under new rules passed in March, undergraduates themselves will now have broad new authority to approve and regulate student organizations. The Undergraduate Council will have the power to approve or deny applications from groups seeking College recognition before the Committee on Student Life, a student-faculty committee, provides their “rubber-stamp” blessing.
In February, a committee tasked with the implementation of the College's social group policy suggested that the College also review recognized student groups to "assess their contributions to the campus community." The Office of Student Life conducts an audit of existing student groups every five years, according to Miller.

The Undergraduate Council established a Black Caucus on Sunday, marking the body’s second formalized  caucus after its Latinx Caucus formed this spring.
Until April, the UC did not recognize any caucuses, with some members arguing that they would add “complex bureaucracy” to the College’s student government. Shortly after the Council passed a piece of legislation formally allowing caucuses, a group of representatives came together to form its Latinx Caucus.
On Sunday, a motion to establish a Black Caucus passed unanimously amongst the Council’s executive board, comprised of the President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer of the Council, as well as chairs of its standing committees.
Victor C. Agbafe ’19, a Dunster House representative and a member of the Black Caucus, said the group of students had already begun its outreach to the student body.
“We’ve already done substantive work meeting with groups to collaborate with the [Black Students’ Association] and we have plans to collaborate with other groups within the black community to get to work here,” he said.
This Wednesday, the Black Caucus and Black Students’ Association will co-host an event protesting Charles A. Murray ’65, a sociologist who previously stirred violent demonstrations at Middlebury College and is set to speak at Harvard.
Also at Sunday’s meeting, the UC amended its governing documents to ensure its budget for the upcoming year will be voted on by members of the soon-to-be elected 36th Undergraduate Council instead of the 35th Undergraduate Council.
Previously, budgets were passed during the UC’s last meeting of the year. Under the new system, the budget will be proposed during the UC’s first meeting with members from the Class of 2021 on Sept. 17.
Speaking to a room of UC members and prospective freshmen interested in hearing more about the student government, Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said that under the Council’s old timeline, new members would not have the opportunity to have a say on the budget.
“The bylaws, as they currently stand, require the Undergraduate Council to pass a budget at the very first meeting of the fall semester which is a problem,” he said. “Many of you, for example, will be held to a budget which you had no hand in making, because we would have to pass it at this meeting right now.”
Candidates for the UC can declare their candidacy starting on Monday morning and election results will be announced on Friday, Sept. 15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been over a year since the College unveiled a policy that will penalize members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. The unprecedented policy took effect a few weeks ago, when the Class of 2021—the first class subject to the social group sanctions—entered Harvard Yard.
Formulated and revised behind closed doors by two separate committees, the policy has been met with protest, resistance from some members of the Faculty, and—for over half a dozen unrecognized student groups—changes in membership policies.
But this summer, the future of that policy was thrown into question when a faculty committee proposed that Harvard ban membership in all social groups, co-ed or otherwise.
Now, with the future of both the existing policy and the proposed ban in question, Harvard students and administrators alike are grappling with the uncertain future of undergraduate social life at Harvard. Here’s a brief explanation of Harvard’s various efforts to reduce the influence of social groups at Harvard.
Breaking from the College’s near-three-decade-long pattern of administrative distance towards its unrecognized social groups, University President Drew G. Faust made the historic move in May 2016 to accept Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s recommended policy to regulate Harvard’s off-campus social life.
The policy—affecting all members of the freshman class—bars members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities from holding leadership positions in recognized student organizations, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
In short, it is a revision—and expansion—of the original policy.
In January, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the creation of a committee that could “revise or replace” the policy penalizing membershing in single-gender social groups. Many professors had argued that they had not been properly consulted in the policy’s formation; the new committee was meant to provide them the opportunity to have input on the College’s efforts to reshape undergraduate social life.
In July the “revise or replace” committee released its preliminary recommendation: that all social groups on Harvard’s campus—including gender neutral groups—be “phased out” by May 2022. In a 22-page report, the committee explained that the social group ban would replace the current sanctions and would take effect beginning with the Class of 2022. Other colleges like Amherst and Bowdoin, which have banned Greek life, provided inspiration for the committee’s recommendation.
Again, the recommended ban is just that—a recommendation. Faculty and students will have the opportunity to chime in on the ban this month before the committee delivers its final recommendations.
Since before they were even announced, Harvard’s efforts to penalize social group membership have been controversial. Shortly after Faust’s announcement, the original policy garnered national attention and sparked strong opinions across campus; many students, faculty, and outside observers opposed it, while some professors, varsity coaches, and members of the Harvard Corporation publicly stated their support.
Unsurprisingly, the clubs themselves have harshly opposed all proposed regulations: the proposed ban also fed speculation that final clubs would potentially sue Harvard.
More than anyone else, though, it has been opposition from professors at Harvard that have most shaped the debate. In particular, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and eleven other faculty members drafted a motion opposing the sanctions in May 2016, resolving that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”
That motion divided professors for months, ultimately prompting Khurana to create the committee to revise the policy. And the opposition is only set to become more intense this semester after Lewis proposed an additional motion aimed at nullifying both the original policy and the potential social group ban.
Seven social groups have changed their membership policies since Harvard announced it would penalize social group membership: the Bee Club, the Delphic Club, the Oak Club, the Sabliere Society (now the “Sab”), the Seneca, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and Kappa Sigma (now KS).
In the months after the sanctions were announced, the Oak Club, the Sablière Society, and the Seneca announced plans to go gender-neutral. They joined the Spee Club, which allowed women to join in the fall of 2015.
Alpha Epsilon Pi, was the first fraternity to go gender neutral and disaffiliate from their national chapter in the spring of 2017. Kappa Sigma went gender neutral in September 2017 and subsequently was “unanimously expelled” by their national chapter.
While the changes in membership policies may make the gender-neutral organizations from the College’s current policy, students in those social groups would still be penalized under the proposed ban.
Thirteen social organizations continue to operate as single-gender. Six out of eight of the all-male final clubs remain all-male. The Fox Club, briefly  welcomed nine women membership in the fall of 2015 on a “provisional” basis before revoking their membership this summer.
Harvard’s other three fraternities—Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon—remain all-male. None of Harvard’s four sororities—Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma—have made changes to their policies.
In the next few months, the Faculty and University President Drew G. Faust will decide whether to continue with the existing policy, adopt the social group ban, or try something else entirely.
Suzannah Clark and Khurana, who led the “revise or replace” committee, wrote an email to Faculty members in August detailing plans to revise their recommendations by September 25, following opportunity for faculty and student input. The committee plans to hold three drop-in faculty-only discussion sessions on Sept. 11, Sept. 14, and Sept. 15 in buildings across campus.
After that committee prepares its final report, it will make its recommendations to Faust, who will make the final call on banning membership in social groups. It’s unclear when Faust will make her decision.
Meanwhile, Faculty are poised to spend another fall semester debating Harvard undergraduate social life. Lewis’ motion could be introduced at the October Faculty meeting or the November Faculty meeting. Professor David L. Howell, a member of the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest elected body, said that it was likely Lewis’ motion would not go to a vote until the December meeting of the Faculty.
If the Faculty side with Lewis, and vote in favor of his anti-sanctions motion, it would deal a significant blow to Khurana’s policy—but it would not unequivocally kill it. However, the Faculty has historically been a formidable opponent to administrators who disagree with them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine months after bowing out in the NCAA Final Four, No. 10 Harvard men’s water polo opened 2017 play at home in the Bruno Classic.
The event was hosted jointly by the Crimson and Brown, with games split between Blodgett Pool and the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center. However, all of Harvard’s contests took place on campus.
On Saturday, the Crimson hardly felt at home, dropping two games. But Harvard rebounded on Sunday with two wins to finish out the tournament. Several freshmen scored for the Crimson to commemorate their collegiate debuts.
“It’s early in the year, so [the record] isn’t too concerning,” co-captain Harry Tafur said. “We have a long road ahead of us, a long season. Overall, we did pretty well, but we still have a lot of things to work on.”
HARVARD 14, WAGNER 9
After facing two tough opponents on Saturday, Harvard maintained a healthy lead for the entirety of the match against the Seahawks. Freshman Dennis Blyashov, junior Nick Bunn, and Tafur all recorded hat tricks for the Crimson.
“We were all definitely motivated after a tough loss Saturday night to Pepperdine,” Tafur said. “We wanted to...get some good outcomes.”
Between the posts, junior goalkeeper Anthony Ridgley recorded 14 saves. The hosts advanced to 4-0 in all-time matchups with Wagner.
HARVARD 19, MCKENDREE 5
Harvard began day two of the Bruno Classic with a dominating performance against McKendree. The Crimson demonstrated its depth, as seven different players—including junior Grayson Judge and sophomores Austin Sechrest and Charlie Owens—scored against the Bearcats in the first half alone. By intermission, Harvard held a 12-1 advantage.
“Sunday definitely [brought] games that we knew we should win and wanted to win by a lot,” captain Harry Tafur said. “We really wanted to go in and just fix the things that went wrong the night before.”
Freshmen continued to make a splash in the pool. Rookie Ben Wagner scored his first collegiate goal against McKendree and ended the game with three goals and one assist. Bylashov and classmate Bruno Snow combined for six assists in the match. Owens led the team offensively with six goals to choke out McKendree, 19-5.
“It was cool to see our freshmen get in there and get their first college action,” Sechrest said. “All four of them scored over the weekend, and two of them dropped hat tricks. That was fun to see.”
PEPPERDINE 16, HARVARD 7
Seeking to overcome an opening loss to Stanford, the Crimson instead dug itself deeper in the second game of the day.
In an afternoon battle against No. 7 Pepperdine, Harvard struggled hard to improve on the morning performance. Bunn led the charge with a hat trick against the Waves, and Sechrest also netted two goals. Co-captains Tafur and Colin Chiapello also propelled the offensive game with three assists and one goal, respectively.
However, that effort proved fruitless, as the high-powered visitors outscored the hosts.
Sunday provided a tough challenge for the Crimson, as their first two matches of the season came against highly ranked teams from the West Coast.
“We have a lot of freshmen in the lineup, so it’s just taking us a while to play well together,” Tafur said. “I think that is where we had most of our pitfalls.”
STANFORD 21, HARVARD 5
The Crimson’s first game of the season was a tough match against West Coast powerhouse and third-ranked Stanford. Snow and Bylashov scored their first career goals, while Bunn led the way with two score, once during play and then a second time with a penalty shot in the fourth quarter.
Ridgley and sophomore Nikhil Suri split time in the net. Ridgley notched five saves, and Suri recorded two.
“Saturday, we were playing two of the top teams in the country,” Sechrest said. “It was tough. We definitely learned… We know that there is a long way to go, and we saw how much hard work it takes to get where we want to be last year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (0-2, 0-0 Ivy League) has impressive talent in place for the 2017 season.
Not only does the Crimson return most of its leading scorers, but also the team has added six new freshmen. Throw in extended rest time before the start of competition, and Harvard seems poised for a dominant opening.
What will become of the season remains to be seen, but for now it appears that the Crimson is still trying to find cohesion amongst individual talent. This difficulty in finding tempo resulted in a slow start this weekend, as Harvard dropped its first home and road matchups.
UMASS LOWELL 3, HARVARD 0
With one game and numerous practices under its belt, the Crimson had a reason for optimism heading into its second non-conference game of the season against UMass Lowell (3-0, 0-0 America East) on Monday. Any hopes fell flat, however, as the River Hawks cruised to a two-goal win.
Although Harvard didn’t score in the first half, the team put up a physical defensive effort, picking up several fouls as a result.
UMass broke the stalemate in the 52nd minute, with defender Chase Reichenberg catching the Crimson by surprise with a quick rebound. He scored after senior goalie Kyle Parks had saved a shot just seconds previously.
For the next 10 minutes, the Crimson stepped up the pressure and found itself in the attacking third often. While the team had two successive corner kicks, neither effort found the back of the net.
The River Hawks were quick to mount a counterattack after the second Crimson corner kick. Midfielder Dario Jovanovski scored off a through ball from the left side to put up UMass, 2-0.
Harvard quickly went back to work after conceding Jovanovski’s goal. Sophomores Taner Dogan and Matthew Glass gave the offense new life with creative play in the midfield. This offense was not enough, though, to put a point on the scoreboard. Nor could the players prevent UMass from scoring again in the 90th minute.
For the second game in a row, Parks recorded six saves. While the offense was stronger, it still was out shot by the River Hawks 12-6, with only one of its six shots on target.
“I think there were a lot of things that were just off here and there, and it added up to not a great rhythm for the group,” head coach Pieter Lehrer said. “In training, it’s really intense, and it’s sharp. I think it’ll come. We’ve got to maintain the lack of frustration and keep going.”
XAVIER 3, HARVARD 0
Three days earlier, Crimson found itself struggling with both first-game jitters and finding a rhythm in a 3-0 loss to Xavier (2-1, 0-0 Big East) at Ohiri field.
The Musketeers dominated from the starting whistle, immediately putting pressure on Harvard. The high pressure paid off, with midfielder Simen Hestnes making a diving header to find the back of the net in the 11th minute.
Ten minutes later, Hestnes and Xavier’s forward Matt Vasquenza struck again, with Vasquenza connecting with his teammate for the second time to extend the Musketeers’ lead to 2-0. The Crimson stepped up its defense for the rest of the half but could not answer with any goals
Harvard regrouped during halftime, and came out stronger in the second half. The team found itself in the attacking third more often but failed to connect passes or capitalize on any opportunities.
Towards the last half-hour, the hosts started to tire. The Musketeers, which had time to get into game shape in their previous two games, took advantage. Forward Samson Sergi buried a ball from 15 yards out to make the score 3-0.
Despite struggles with finding a flow, players performed on an individual level. Parks made six saves for the Crimson, and freshman Paolo Belloni-Urso led the offense with four shots. Co-captain and defender Eric Gylling tallied the other three of Harvard’s total seven shots.
“It felt like we were a bunch of individuals out there today,” co-captain and defender Justin Crichlow said. “It felt like we weren’t playing as a team completely, but it is our first game. It’s really just a learning experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team will have to wait another weekend for a shot at its first win of the season.
The Crimson (0-3) hosted the Harvard Invitational at the Malkin Athletic Center over the weekend, settling for fourth place in the tournament after losses to Stony Brook, Sacred Heart, and American.
“Obviously, starting off the season with three losses was not what we were hoping for,” senior hitter Paige Kebe said. “But we are still in the process of integrating everyone in the team and finding their positions. Our lineups were all over the place, and I think we did a good job of being adaptable.”
Despite the result, Harvard saw excellent individual performances from several team leaders, including co-captain and blocker Christina Cornelius, who earned all-tournament honors with 13 blocks and 27 kills.
AMERICAN 3, HARVARD 1
Despite a first-set victory for Harvard, the Crimson fell off in the three ensuing frames, settling for a loss in the final match of the tournament.
American outside hitter Aleksandra Kazala dominated the offensive game for the Eagles, finishing with 25 kills off 39 total attempts. Harvard struggled much of the contest to stop the American offense, succeeding on only four blocks.
After the first set, the Crimson failed to keep pace, as the Eagles broke away with large leads at the end of sets. Only in the start of the last set did the hosts manage to hold onto a tight score before allowing a stronger American team to take charge.
SACRED HEART 3, HARVARD 2
Seeking a bounce-back victory Saturday afternoon, Harvard fell short in a narrow defeat against a fellow New England college.
“This was definitely a learning weekend,” Cornelius said. “We learned so much and focused on two things—resiliency and grit. We had some really great moments of that over the weekend and are heading in a good direction.”
Like Stony Brook, the Pioneers (2-4) already had one tournament under their belt before coming to Cambridge. Sacred Heart was also seeking its second win of the season before facing the Crimson.
The two teams traded set points in the first four games, leading to a critical tiebreaker. The back-and-forth play continued in the last set, as the Pioneers and Harvard were tied up five times during the frame.
However, Sacred Heart pulled away late, topped off by two kills to end the game. While the Pioneers had a lower hitting percentage and block totals than the Crimson, the visitors relied on slightly better dig totals and aces to edge their opponent.
Harvard’s defense hinged on freshman libero Sydney Vach, who recorded a team-high 17 digs.
Hitter and fellow rookie Mindie Mabry also impressed on the offensive side, delivering nine kills and 11.5 total points for the Crimson.
“The freshmen did great for their first tournament.” Kebe said. “ They were able to stay composed under the pressure, and we are really proud of their performance this weekend. Volleyball-wise, they definitely have some great skills.”
STONY BROOK 3, HARVARD 1
The Seawolves (3-4) captured their second win of the season on Friday night, defeating the Crimson in four sets.
Harvard’s lone game win came in the second set, when a match-high 18 kills and .444 hitting percentage allowed the Crimson to edge out Stony Brook, 25-22.
In that set, sophomore blocker Sope Adeleye earned four of her six total kills in the contest, while Cornelius ended the set with six finishes. A crucial attacking spree by Cornelius in the middle of the frame allowed the Crimson to break away from the Seawolves and earn the point.
However ,Stony Brook bounced back from the second set, defeating Harvard 25-16 in the third set and 25-19 in the fourth. While Cornelius’s nine kills marked a team high for the Crimson, four players on the Seawolves managed to end the night with double-digit kill totals.
Leading Stony Brook was junior blocker McKyla Brooks, who earned the Seawolves 17 points through her attacking prowess.
Searching for the season’s first victory, Harvard will travel to Dayton, Ohio, this weekend as it plays in the Holiday Inn Invitational against Midwest foes Wright State, West Virginia, and Texas Tech.
“Winning the Ivy League is our main overarching goal this season, something we haven’t done for a long time.” Kebe said. “Since we have such a young team, being able to work together and be adaptable in multiple positions will be really important for the team to be successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following last Tuesday’s shutout loss to Northeastern, the Harvard women’s soccer team came back with a vengeance, posting twin 1-0 wins this Labor Day Weekend. With the pair of victories, the Crimson (3-1-0) left New Britain, Conn. with the CCSU Tournament crown ahead of three other teams.
Freshman forward Murphy Agnew was the star in Friday night’s opener against host Central Connecticut State, scoring her first career goal in the 69th minute past junior netminder Ashley Cavanaugh. Sophomore goalie Kat Hess, meanwhile, kept the Blue Devils off the board for 90 minutes—her first career solo shutout—to preserve the 1-0 scoreline.
Two days later, in Sunday’s day game against St. John’s, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi punched home the golden goal in double overtime to give Harvard its second 1-0 victory of the weekend. Fellow veteran Dani Stollar provided the game-winning cross in the 105th minute.
“We knew we’d have to play Friday and Sunday, which we haven’t done all year, with one day’s rest,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “It was a new challenge in multiple ways for us, but I was really proud of how we responded.”
HARVARD 1, ST. JOHN’S 0 (2OT)
Harvard’s second match of the first-ever CCSU tournament was the title-decider, and it took double overtime for the Crimson to squeak by a stout St John’s (3-1-1) team. After nearly 105 minutes of scoreless play, Mohammadi poked in a cross from Stollar into the lower left corner of the net, and the Harvard bench was quick to explode in celebration.
“We kept attacking and attacking and finally we had our opportunity,” Hess said of the marathon victory. “We all banded together and sprinted out onto the field together—one of the best celebrations I’ve ever had.”
Mohammadi’s goal was her second game-winner of this young season—she also provided all of the Crimson’s scoring in its 1-0 season-opening win over Providence. An important contributor to last year’s Ivy-winning squad, the veteran has already matched her goal total from last year (two) just four games into the 2017 season.
Junior netminder Danielle Etzel also tallied her first career solo shutout, making three saves in 104:57. She benefitted from a staunch Harvard defense, which laid claim to its third of the field and never conceded a corner kick.
The combination of positional control and sturdy last-line defense completely shut down a Red Storm offense that had powered St John’s to a three-game winning streak prior to encountering the Crimson.
Mohammadi took it upon herself to keep the pressure on the Red Storm, recording a team-high five shots, while Stollar and freshmen Sammy Murrell and Lauren Raimondo each tallied one apiece. Mohammadi, Stollar, and the rest of the upperclassmen will look to synergize even further with the freshmen as the season progresses.
Given that both Harvard and St. John’s were winners on day one, the Crimson’s victory guaranteed it the tournament crown.
HARVARD 1, CCSU 0
Harvard has had CCSU’s number as of late, including a 3-0 win last season. A visit to the Blue Devils’ home turf didn’t lessen the Crimson’s typically strong play.
While it was the upperclassmen who starred in Sunday’s game, the freshmen started the fire against the CCSU. Their spark was especially important in the rainy conditions on Friday night.
After 68-plus minutes of scoreless play, Harvard was able to break through on the skills of their newcomers. Freshman midfielder Maria DiMartinis fed a short pass to fellow rookie Agnew, who rocketed a 25-yard shot into the back of the net for the tie-breaking goal. The score held up, as Hess shut out the home team the rest of the way.
“[Agnew’s] been working hard, she’s been dangerous, [and] she’s been creating some good chances,” Hamblin said. “It was going to happen, and it was a wonderful finish.”
Hess made three stops in goal in the 90 minutes of play, and the sophomore goalie is now 2-0 on the season.
“We’ve got a really strong backline of experienced players,” Hess said. “They made me look good. They made my job very easy, and it’s really exciting to be able to play with them.”
Though both Etzel and Hess played supporting roles last year behind graduated goalie Lizzie Durack, both returning players have made the most of their time in goal this year.
“They’re both under the spotlight, and we’re really confident in both of them,” Hamblin said. “We’ve had three shutouts in four games—credit to not only them but also our defending, front to back.”
DiMartini’s assist and Agnew’s goal were both career firsts. Mohammadi, meanwhile, peppered in four shots on goal for the game.
“It’s exciting because the strength of our team doesn’t come just from our juniors and our seniors,” Hess said. “We’ve got some strong players in the freshman class, as well. At the end of the day…we all contributed.”

After spending a good three months in Cambridge this summer, Flyby has had a lot of time to reflect on Harvard’s hometown. The following are some questions (of varying importance) that we found ourselves asking.
What is Cambridge without Harvard? What is Harvard without Cambridge?
Cantabrigians love to say that Cambridge exists beyond Harvard. But is it really true that if University President Drew G. Faust were to pack up the Yard, put it in her back pocket, and hit the road, the city would remain the same? When people think of Cambridge, their first thought isn’t the Porter Square T Station or Longfellow House. They think of Harvard University, with its brick buildings and crimson scarves (or MIT, if they’re nerds). So, this summer, we had to ask ourselves what Cambridge really means without the briefcased professors and exhausted students.
While the greater Boston area has its fair share of summer activities (which you’ve hopefully read about on Flyby every week), events that actually take place in Cambridge often revolve around Harvard or MIT. Cambridge is a college town, albeit not your typical college town. Our ultimate conclusion, though, is that just as Cambridge is inescapably tied to Harvard, without Cambridge, Harvard might not have Felipe’s (among other things that a functioning city government and solid infrastructure allow). So, it’s a mutually symbiotic relationship.
Are tourists who wear matching gear better or worse than normally dressed tourists? 
Worse. Definitely worse.
What are the pros and cons of riding the T? 
There’s nothing like the moment when the AC hits you as you clamber aboard a bus you’ve been chasing, the feeling when there isn’t a line to add money to your CharlieCard, the painful-but-endearing screech of the train as the Red Line hurtles from Central into Harvard. But are these fleeting instances of satisfaction with the MBTA worth making a habit of riding the bus/train?
After all, the MBTA gives us the Green Line. That speaks for itself. Maybe the biggest blessings are in the little things, then, like the view of the Boston skyline as the Red Line crosses the Longfellow Bridge—there’s a transitory beauty to this perspective of the Charles, a perspective unique to a ride on the T.
Is the choice to take the T a simple matter of necessity, or does our decision to (somewhat begrudgingly) participate in a flawed system say something deeper about who we are? We haven’t found the answer to this one yet, but it’s food for thought next time you’re making a commute with the MBTA.
What have we accomplished since June?
Very little.
Is Cambridge a good place to spend the summer?
When you’re spending your summer in Cambridge, you’re not really just spending your summer in Cambridge. No city is an island—we’re surrounded by towns and linked by colonial history, a common spirit, and the T. What is Cambridge if not next to Boston? What is Boston without Brookline? What is Brookline’s purpose if JFK isn’t mentioned every few blocks? As Carl Sagan once said, we are all connected. 
So our answer to this one is a definite yes—where else can you leave the gates of Harvard, sail the Charles, and take a walk through history, all in one sunny day? If you stay here for the summer, you’d be surprised by what you might learn about the greater Boston area...and maybe even about yourself.
