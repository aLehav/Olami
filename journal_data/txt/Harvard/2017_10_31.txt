The year after Alice Munro—a Canadian short story writer—won the Nobel Prize in Literature, my family moved back to Toronto. In a used bookstore downtown, I discovered an entire shelf of “Canadiana”—a large portion of which was occupied by Munro’s books. Drawn by the title, I picked up “Who Do You Think You Are?” (published in the U.S. as “The Beggar Maid”) and began to read.
The collection of short stories chronicles the protagonist Rose’s upbringing in a poor town in Southern Ontario, under her practical but parochial stepmother. In the third story, “Half a Grapefruit,” Rose enters the local high school “across the bridge,” where she encounters a divide between the well-off students from the town and those from the country. The well-meaning but naïve teacher “asks what [students] had for breakfast, to see if they were keeping Canada’s Food Rules.” The country students ate “tea and porridge,” and on the other side of the classroom, the town students “claimed to have eaten toast and marmalade, bacon and eggs, Corn Flakes, even waffles and syrup.”
Munro wrote, “Rose had stuck herself onto the back of a town row. West Hanratty was not represented, except by her. She was wanting badly to align herself with towners, against her place of origin, to attach herself to those waffle-eating coffee-drinking aloof and knowledgeable possessors of breakfast nooks.”
She proudly announces that she ate “half a grapefruit”—the fanciest breakfast item she could imagine—thus becoming the subject of scorn from her country classmates. But Rose can’t deny that she wants to escape her rural origins to become a member of the cultured elite. As she finds a home in the thick books that she brings home from school (much to her stepmother’s dismay), she increasingly aspires to the life she finds in books such as Katherine Mansfield’s “The Garden Party.” Upon hearing someone shout, “Well, I guess yez wondered where I was,” Rose thinks, “Katherine Mansfield had no relatives who said yez.”
This story conjured memories of the social unease I felt growing up, in small talk and classroom conversations about what I had done during summer vacations. It is an unease I experience even now, when upon finding out that I moved around so often, people ask if my parents are professors or diplomats. One possible solution, as Rose demonstrates, is to embellish and overcompensate in a desperate attempt to “fit in”—in my case, packaging instability as mobility and worldliness. But this leads one to vacillate between being ashamed and being guilty for feeling ashamed. As Rose’s story shows, there is a delicate balance between bettering oneself and staying true to one’s roots, between doing things and being able to explain them to people from back home. In the titular story, Rose’s teacher admonishes her, saying, “You can’t go thinking you are better than other people just because you can learn poems. Who do you think you are?”

Because October is the month of horror movies, it seemed appropriate to defend the quality of the documentary-style horror film “Paranormal Activity” (2007). The film has been received with a healthy dose of skepticism: film critics question if it can be as successful as “The Blair Witch Project,” and audiences criticized the film’s reliance on jump scares. However, there are some genuinely terrifying characteristics to watch out for as the bedroom door slowly creaks open.
The horror factor to some extent depends on how far the viewer is willing to suspend disbelief.This film has scenes that may confuse the viewer. Do not reject them. One of the best terrors in “Paranormal Activity” is the fact that not everything is explained. The later films in the franchise work a little too hard to try to explain things, which is a defensive (and misguided) reaction to the critiques of the first film.
The casual atmosphere in the film allows it to recreate some of the successes of the “Blair Witch Project.” The duo of actors were not famous celebrities were therefore unknown to almost everybody watching. The lack of any framing introduction to the film gives it the feel of found footage. It was shot in an actual house, implying that the haunting could happen to anybody. Even in the credits, in which we’re supposed to be given the comfort that this is just a movie, it is revealed that the actors used their real names in the film. This just takes one more step towards being scarily close to invading our own lives.
Speaking from experience, the best way to prepare for watching the movie is simply to convince oneself of the scary nature of the film. Immersion can come by being tricked by an older brother that the movie was in fact found footage and sitting truly horrified throughout the whole film until the credits roll (again, speaking from experience). No matter how it’s done, a viewer should allow themselves to fall into the atmosphere of “Paranormal Activity” in order to witness the high-quality horror that the hour and 26  minutes has to offer. Just be sure to be careful of what lurks at the bottom of the stairs.

Feverish screams and cheers filled the Lowell Lecture Hall as Robert Rush ’18 and Janae A. Hughes ’18, directors of Expressions Dance Company, came onto the stage of their sold-out show, “Expressions: EXposed.”
“As per tradition, we are going to ask you to scream,” Hughes said. “So if you see something that you do like, you should scream. If you see something you don’t like, you should scream. If you see something, you should scream.”
Throughout the two shows on Oct. 28, the company promised contemporary music, quality dancing, and an all-around party. It delivered on all of that. The show started off slightly out of sync and seemingly unsure, but improved with each performance. Throughout the night, the dancers deliberately interacted with the audience and successfully used the music to portray emotion and keep pace.
The dancing itself started off a little weak, but built up in strength and synchronization as the night wore on. At first, the dancing was often not together and the dancers seemed unsure of their movements. The first-time performers in the “Company Piece” changed that, however, bringing a bundle of energy and incredible moves. The best parts of the night were “Too Much Sauce,” in which the motions were strong, sharp, and together, and “EXP: L$D (Love. Sex. Dreams)” which displayed fluid hand-and-footwork, fast twerking, and emotive energy. The dancers also effectively made use of the entire space. They moved from tight formations to long lines across every corner of the room. During one sequence, the dancers spread out and covered the ground with their bodies, lying in rows across the entire room. Then, they slowly got up through a series of backbend-like movements, with grace and impressive technique. Other incredible tricks included back handsprings, a handstand twerk, and several jump splits, all executed cleanly. The performers successfully created an awe-inspiring piece.
The atmosphere was exciting and sexy, and the interactiveness of the show made it enjoyable. From the beginning of the show, the energy from the dancers radiated from the room. The dancers interacted with the audience by dancing in front of them. In the second part, “Daddy’s Home,” the dancers chose three people to sit in chairs on stage where the performers danced around them. During an intermission, three other audience members showed off their moves. The Emcees, Nani Redford ’19 and Hasani Hayden ’19, were particularly relaxed and humorous. All of this contributed to a fun, light-hearted, and energetic atmosphere.
The music in the show fit very well with the dancing, incorporating many contemporary popular hits. In moments where the music turned psychedelic, the dancers slowed down and moved in connected, fluid motions. Other times, the dancers successfully matched the pace of the music. Some of the titles included “Humble” by Kendrick Lamar, “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee ft. Justin Bieber, and “Bodak Yellow” by Cardi B.
Other components of the performance, like the strobe lights and the costumes, deliberately added to the show, but did not take away from the dancing. Often, the dancers’ dress was all black or just a solid-colored shirt. The outfits brought attention to the moves that the dancers’ bodies were making rather than distracting from them. The strobe lights added to moments of tension in which the dance moves became sharp with fast transitions.
Although the show began unsteadily, by the end the company put on a magnificent show that featured quality dancing, music, and atmosphere. The dancing was energetic, mostly in sync, and entertaining. The vigorous atmosphere and trendy music definitely contributed to the show’s experience. The music, lights, and costumes made it possible to highlight the actions of the dancers. Together, this created an illusion of a big party, leading up to the last number, which was indeed “Lit AF.”

On Oct. 25, Glenn Lowry ’76, director of New York’s Museum of Modern Art, came to the Harvard Art Museums to deliver the annual Henri Zerner lecture, entitled “In Between Places: Making Contemporary Art in the Middle East.” Lowry, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art since 1995, received both his master’s and doctoral degrees from Harvard in the history of art. His talk surveyed several contemporary Middle Eastern artists to demonstrate the nature of the space in which they work, which he terms “in-between.”
Lowry began the lecture by deconstructing the notion of the Middle East, arguing that the Western understanding of the Middle East—and its associated terms—might be overly limiting, excluding parts of the world inhabited by Muslim immigrants. He argued that the past century has seen a trend of “deterritorialization,” or, the disassociation of people of various cultures from their home countries.
The talk revolved around the theme of “in between-ness,” as Lowry argued that the Middle East ought to be a case study for self-identity and location in a changing world. He connected various artists to issues of place and belonging, arguing that the artists each used distinct methods to rationalize the constant change in geography in the Middle East. “Anxiety needs to be incorporated into the object of critical attention,” Lowry remarked. “Anxiety is the effective address to the world that reveals itself as caught up in between frames.”
Lowry discussed the representation of space in modern Middle Eastern art, invoking the example of Oraib Toukan, a Lebanese artist who created an exhibition called “The New(er) Middle East.” The piece engages the audience by allowing them to re-arrange countries to create new maps of the Middle East. Lowry sees this piece as an example of ways in which Middle Eastern artists complicate the notion of a fixed definition of the region. Lowry also drew upon the work of Jananne Al-Ani, an Iraqi artist known for her ongoing collection “The Aesthetics of Disappearance: A Land Without People,” a critique of media representations of the Gulf War. Lowry argued that Al-Ani’s work develops the notion of belonging in space. He noted that her works, which typically depict desolate locations that are no longer inhabited, demonstrate the possibility of preservation and survival in response to war and destruction.
Lowry developed the theme of diaspora by discussing the work of Bouchra Khalili, a Moroccan-French artist whose work “The Mapping Journey Project” was featured at the Museum of Modern Art in 2016. “Khalili succeeds at making these stories intensely personal, while allowing us to follow each person’s journey without seeing their face, and allowing us to understand their journey as part of a larger migration,” Lowry remarked.
The talk integrated paintings, sculptures, film, and emerging forms of digital art. Lowry discussed the Saudi Arabian physician and artist Ahmed Mater’s work “The Desert of Pharan,” which seeks to uncover the hidden story behind the restoration and modern construction of Mecca. “Mater’s photographs take us from dramatic aerial views of Mecca to the forgotten corners of the city, from the Quba to the desolate,” Lowry said. He argued that the project might serve as an “unofficial history” of the city, one that does not overlook the lesser known buildings that hold religious salience in the Islamic tradition.
Lowry concluded by arguing that the artists he had discussed use strategies familiar to European artists, but deploy them to speak about issues of colonialism and space. He ended with his description of the space these Middle Eastern artists are working in. “Liminal space, the in-between space, at times metaphoric and emotional or spiritual, where these artists balance the contingency of settlement with the reality of itinerancy,” he said.
Winston Robinson, a Cambridge resident, commented on the breadth of the talk. “I didn’t expect it to be in depth, but I don’t think anyone could have covered it in more depth really, since the whole point of the talk was that the art is evolving and that it’s not just one thing, but a whole bunch of things,” he said.
Charles S. Krumholz ’18 remarked on the lecture serving as a much-needed platform. “I think it was powerful to use the voice of the director of MoMA to focus on an area of the world that isn’t focused on as much in art museums, and I’m hoping that opens up future opportunities for intellectual discourse about the region,” he said.

Within the past ten years, a swarm of creepy characters have been born and reborn in the horror genre, from the makeup work used to create Pennywise the Dancing Clown in “It” (2017) to the chilling technical effects in “Lights Out” (2016). But paranormal beings aren’t the only villains in these movies. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best movies with the most unsettling monsters in horror: humans.
5. You’re Next (2011)Newcomer Erin (Sharni Vinson) and her boyfriend Crispian (A.J. Bowen) quickly become victims of a murder mystery at Crispian’s wealthy family’s reunion. After the first arrow flies—quite literally—the group panics and tries to figure out the motive of the animal-masked people picking them off. Erin is a badass protagonist who thinks on her feet and makes her own rules.  Aside from Erin, the elaborate plot and hidden motives of the attackers in “You’re Next” make this film a great start to our list.
4. The Strangers (2008)Speaking of masked villains, “The Strangers” takes a bad date night to the next level. Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) return home from an unsavory dinner only to be tormented by masked people who show up in their front yard. Throughout the night, we get fragments of what happened during the date and grow attached to this unlucky and terrified couple. The plot in “The Strangers” is structured like a dance, and the eerie use of sound in the movie sends goosebumps up the skin, from the silence of the masked antagonists to the unsettling whine of a record player.
3. Hush (2016)Reeling from a recent breakup, Maddie (Kate Siegel) moves to a home in the woods to finish her next novel. But in the first 15 minutes of the film, Maddie’s friend visits and is murdered. A cat-and-mouse chase ensues over the course of the night between the culprit and Maddie. This jarring start sheds light on the fact that Maddie lost her hearing and voice, and doesn’t hear her friend screaming in peril, right outside her home. Maddie’s identity as an author comes into gradual play as she retaliates and uses her creative skills to sort things out. Eventually, we begin to ask: Who is the cat and who is the mouse?
2. Get Out (2017)Eight months after its release, “Get Out” has easily found its way into the horror movie genre. When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his girlfriend Rose’s (Allison Williams) parents, he finds more sinister layers to the casual racism of her affluent white family. The film is a powerful blend of witty humor and social commentary. “Get Out” bubbles with anxiety with its disturbing unsettling characters.
1. The Invitation (2015)A hidden gem of sorts, “The Invitation” takes the cake for the best horror movie with human antagonists. Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) are reunited with Will’s old friends during a house reception put together by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard). With no evidence of an ulterior motive, Will is unable to convince his friends that something is wrong with Eden’s invitation. All good horror films strive to craft an atmosphere of suspense. “The Invitation” does so by creating a story without trust, in which we the audience become skeptical of everyone involved. It holds its suspense artfully, breaking it only to show just how horrifying people can be.

On Oct 24, Harvard’s English Department brought together three prominent writers on campus for “Fact or Fiction: Writing Journalism, Writing Literature.” Claire Messud, Lorraine Adams, and Jill E. Abramson ’76 each offered opinions on the art of storytelling, drawing on their professional experiences in the journalism and publishing industries.
Messud, Senior Lecturer of the English Department and New York Times bestselling author, served as moderator, asking Adams and Abramson a series of questions. Adams, a former investigative journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, opened her story with Watergate. Watching the events unfold, she was inspired to pursue journalism, turning a historic political debacle into the story that launched her career. Being a teenager at the time of the scandal, Adams became more and more in love with the idea of journalism and cracking cases, she said.
However, becoming a journalist seemed like a fantasy that would stay a dream.“The thought of being a journalist was unthinkable for me. I was so shy,” Adams said.
Abramson also found a source of inspiration for journalism through tumultuous events in history. Nixon’s administration proved a critical moment in her journalistic career. While she was an undergraduate student here at Harvard, Abramson said that she wrote as a stringer for Time Magazine, covering the 1976 presidential race. After graduation, she continued to pursue journalism seriously and worked towards the top, eventually becoming the first female Executive Editor of the New York Times.
Both women spoke on their experiences becoming journalists and learning to love what they do. Adams said that she realized there was so much wrong with the world and so much to be done for the people who would never be able to speak for themselves. “I started being a voice. I was unable to be shut up,” Adams said.
Adams and Abramson both touched on the less glamorous sides of journalism, discussing the harshness of revealing facts to the public. As Abramson said, “The mission is to uncover the truth.”
This point drove many of Adam’s examples as well, and she hinted that the journalism industry did not always do a good job of sticking to this mission.  She said that it’s significantly easier to write about subjects that mean very little than to write about subjects that can change lives. “Newspapers have to be more awake to the ‘unthinkable,’” Adams said.
Transitioning out of their endeavors in journalism, Abramson and Adams discussed what it meant to write literature and author their books. Abramson described it as a completely different sense of writing. Adams elaborated on this point, emphasizing that she wanted to express her style more.
“I became increasingly dissatisfied with journalism,” Adams said. “I feel what I write is getting at things that are new. What I wanted to do, and what I couldn’t do in the newsroom[,] was show individuality.”
Adams also went on to encourage students to pursue writing, be it journalism or literature. Though she addressed many of each form of writing’s distinctive qualities throughout the talk, she commended the importance of writing as both an art and a powerful tool for social change. She said, “I think we should write, but I can’t be the [only] one to do it.”

Although some of the show’s basics have changed in The CW’s “Jane the Virgin,” Season Four’s premiere is a reminder of why the show is so addicting and fulfilling. To recap, it has been several years since Michael’s death. Jane and her son, Mateo, are still living with Jane’s mother and grandmother. Rafael has been kicked out of the hotel by his sister, Luisa, who is still helping her lover Sin Rostro, a notorious drug lord. Despite the comedic flaws of the episode, the newest character—Adam (Tyler Posey)—and the changed love triangle make for an enthralling watch.
The season continues the unreciprocated romance between Jane and Rafael that has existed since the beginning. This grows tiring and repetitive as the writers attempt a subtle build-up of Jane and Rafael’s relationship, only to shut it down.
But the new love triangle between Jane, Rafael, and Adam is compelling. Adam represents a new beginning in Jane’s love life. He lives in a studio apartment and spends his days working as an up-and-coming comic book artist. Compared to the other male characters in the show, Adam is average. His friendliness goes hand-in-hand with the fact that he appears to have no baggage and no drama. Again, this is a brand new trait amongst Jane’s love interests, breaking the show away from its previous monotony.
Jane’s father Rogelio once again carries the show with his humor. His ego and self-centeredness is dramatic and a beloved trademark of the show. But at this point, I wish the show would get past that. The humor should be much more interspersed throughout the episode, rather than just reliant on Rogelio’s thick accent and flamboyant personality.
Despite this minor issue, “Jane the Virgin” still shines through in its commitment to an aesthetic. In every episode, the clothes of the characters are matched to their scene’s backgrounds, allowing for a soft, mellow, and easy feeling with the show. Prior to Adam, the show has been big on pastels and nautical colors. However, since Adam, there has been a new aesthetic added that is full of reds, blues, and denim, going for a harsher look. These aesthetics surprisingly balance each other out, helping introduce a grittier city setting to the otherwise summery world of “Jane the Virgin.”
While all the other characters are dealing with drug deals, hotel drama, and sibling hostility, Adam seems to be living a simpler life that is refreshing for a telenovela. With the possibility of an interesting love triangle, the season still promises to be worth the watch.

Sufjan Stevens once described his music as a clash between high art and low art to the point where the listener has to ask, “Is this good music? Is this good writing or is this just silly?” Many musicians who try to keep their music lyrically simple can bring up similar questions, especially those whose lyrics suggest vague notions of love and positivity. Of all of the folk-type music I’ve heard that attempts this, Bob Marley is the only musician who doesn’t come off as corny. Marley was the rare artist who, at least in appearance, sincerely bought into the substance of what he wrote. It’s one of the reasons his live shows were so revered. His emotional sincerity, however, is especially clear on “Exodus,” an album that stunningly meshes activism with spirituality and love.
“Exodus,” which turned 40 this summer, always felt like Bob Marley’s ultimate studio album in that it fully realized him as a musical force. It was only Marley’s third album without Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, the other leading members of The Wailers. While his previous album, “Rastaman Vibration,” had higher US chart success and his first “solo” album, “Natty Dread,” is a classic in its own right, “Exodus” always felt more spiritual.  It is very much a political album and “Exodus” has the urgency that such an album requires, but the passion melts into joy for being alive.
The circumstances behind the recording of “Exodus” are now legend. In the 1970s, Jamaica’s political climate was something of a battlefield. The Jamaican Labour Party and the People’s National Party were at odds: The People’s National Party under Prime Minister Michael Manley pursued socialist policies and an alliance with Cuba, and the Opposition Labour Party pursued more conservative policies and an alliance with America. The two parties used gangs to fight their ideological opponents. Marley felt the need to hold the “Smile Jamaica Concert” to promote peace and unity. Two days before the concert, however, Marley and his wife were shot. Both survived and performed at the concert, turning what was supposed to be a one-song performance into 90 minutes. Shortly after, Marley moved to London and recorded “Exodus” there.
“Exodus” has a stronger British influence than The Wailers’ previous albums, incorporating rock, funk, and a variety of other genres popular in England. What makes “Exodus” so distinct, however, is not the influences but the album’s unconventional structure. Rarely in music are albums as back-loaded as “Exodus.” While both sides of the album are political and spiritual, the first side deals with these ideas in more religious terms and the second side uses more mortal themes, like partying, sex, and love. This second side includes the most captivating songs on the album. But out of context, songs like “Jamming” and “One Love/People Get Ready” don’t carry the same weight. Part of the reason those songs feel so fresh despite their well-tread topics is because “Exodus” features a distinctly inward progression. “Natural Mystic” focuses on the masses, while “So Much Things to Say” and “Guiltiness” focus on the oppressors of the people.  “The Heathen” acts as a sort of transition to the oppressed, and “Exodus” and “Jamming” follow. Marley continues to narrow the lens to two people in “Waiting in Vain” and “Turn Your Lights Down Low” and to the self in “Three Little Birds” and “One Love/People Get Ready.” “Exodus” is an album that calls for change in Jamaica, but the progression of the album implies changes from outside in. In the context of the album, loving one another isn’t just a bland, vague sentiment. Instead, it means actively ensuring that the impoverished and oppressed are properly fed and aided. This is why Marley’s proclamations of love and peace never felt as hokey as those of many other artists. There were strong convictions behind these sentiments because he at least appeared to genuinely believe in the power of love and understanding to help the poor and the hungry of Jamaica.
“Exodus” doesn’t just work because of its structure, however. The music is brilliant. The Barrett brothers’ percussion is key to the spiritual feel, and Junior Marvin and Al Anderson’s guitars on the title track and on “Turn Your Lights Down Low” are thoroughly seductive. “Jamming” is one of the funkiest tracks I’ve ever heard. The I Threes’ vocalization is stunning, especially on “Three Little Birds” and on “One Love/People Get Ready,” where they’re essential to the uplifting power of the songs. Above all else, however, Marley’s voice shines and coats each track with a sort of passionate exuberance. As a protest song, “So Much Things to Say” has no right to be nearly as bubbly as it is, but Marley makes it oddly joyful. Similarly, “Waiting in Vain” is song of unrequited love, but when Marley sings, he sounds so happy just to be able to feel so strongly about someone. The exuberance might come partly from having survived his assassination attempt and partly from just caring about his source material.
Forty years later, “Exodus” is one of the most uplifting protest albums ever. The spirituality and positivity work to energize the album and instill a sense that love and peace really can save everyone. Marley was never able to recapture the energy of “Exodus,” but the album’s motivational power is timeless.

“The only exciting thing about 2002 is that it’s a palindrome,” declares Lady Bird McPherson (Saoirse Ronan) in the driest tone possible, as if making  a vocal frown (as any properly angsty teen should), while clearly looking proud to have come up with such a clever maxim.
Through these viscerally recognizable high school moments—from the question “How do you know when it’s working?” to a montage of horrible school play auditions, to nuns demanding “six inches for the Holy Spirit” from affectionate slow dancers—the teen drama comes of age in Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird.” The film is a dazzlingly realistic representation of American teenagerdom, and its poignancy hurts like growing pains all over again.
The sepia glow of golden California sunshine illuminates much of the film, which serves as a love letter to Lady Bird’s (and Gerwig’s) hometown of Sacramento. By her teenaged years, Lady Bird is sick of the place where she’s lived her whole life, and constantly complains about the city’s blandness. However, Gerwig juxtaposes Lady Bird’s grumbling with romantic shots that reveal the beauty of busted up convenience stores and Spanish-style churches. It’s not until Lady Bird enters the blue-grey landscape of New York City that she truly loves and misses the rolling Sacramento highways.
Lady Bird’s love-hate relationship with her hometown is not unique, because everything is a love-hate relationship when you’re an emotionally volatile teenager. Lady Bird’s relationship with her mother, Marion McPherson (Laurie Metcalf), is especially touching. Their dynamic constantly switches between infinite tenderness and infinite loathing. One moment, they’re tearing up as their audio cassette of “The Grapes of Wrath” winds to a close. The next, Marion is yelling, “You’re not even worthy of state tuition!” and Lady Bird jumps out of the moving car, breaking her wrist. “Lady Bird” demonstrates especially well how any situation can go from being the best thing that’s ever happened to being the end of the world: All it takes is your mom yelling at you to pick your clothes up off the floor.
This film is a comedy, but its humor comes from naked moments of painful relatability, rather than elaborately contrived premises or jokes. So many of the distressingly awkward conversations in this movie are hilarious not just because they’re distressingly awkward, but also because Lady Bird is far from the first one to greet her crush with “Come here often?” upon running into him and his family at the local supermarket. Characters try so hard to be cool or witty or impressive or funny, and they always fail even harder.  Lady Bird’s dark and broody crush, Kyle (Timothée Chalamet), is both ridiculous and recognizable in the way he doesn’t believe in money (“I’m trying to live by bartering alone,”) or cellphones (“It’ll be a matter of time before they’re in our brains,”) or store-bought cigarettes (“I only smoke hand-rolled. Never industrially produced,”), and the triteness of these statements make them funnier and more endearing.
“Lady Bird” is primarily focused on the white teenage experience, like most teen movies, but does a good job of incorporating important issues like class, mental illness, sexuality, and race into its narrative. Unconsciously hurting her parents, Lady Bird often often says that the McPhersons live on the “wrong side of the tracks,” but the family unquestionably must deal with financial stress. Lady Bird shops exclusively at thrift shops not just for the sake of being indie, but because her family can’t afford clothes that aren’t secondhand. Marion is almost perpetually worn out by her long shifts at odd hours, and the chronic stress about money contributes to her husband’s bouts of clinical depression. Lady Bird’s romantic pursuits are messy, just as they are in real life, as Lady Bird and the people around her come to terms with their sexual identities. When Lady Bird finds out that she didn’t get into UC Berkeley, she implies in a fit of rage that her brother only got in because he is Latino, alluding to an affirmative action debate that is still happening today.
Sometimes, Lady Bird is a little brat who doesn’t seem to know how to use her brain properly. She is undeniably cringeworthy, but also so lovable and observant and perceptive. All the characters in this film, like all the characters in real life, contain multitudes. “Lady Bird” is real life projected on the big screen, and the ugly parts are as painstakingly reproduced as the beautiful ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ninth annual Boston Book Festival took place on Saturday, Oct. 28 in Copley Square. The event celebrated reading, writing, and other less traditional forms of literature. The festival was reminiscent of an amusement park—especially for those who enjoy reading and writing—enlivening Copley Square in a welcoming, warm, and exciting way.
Live music permeated the Square, playing in the background of the free event, and tents filled the space. These tents housed publishing houses from both the Cambridge/Boston area and Massachusetts. Additionally, well-respected authors came to sign books, including Tom Perrotta, Jacqueline Woodson, Maureen Dowd, and Harvard University’s Claire Messud, some of whom spoke at the festival as well.
Though the entire festival was star-studded, it was less about the authors themselves and more about what the gathering meant for the city of Boston and its surrounding areas. Catherine Gaggioli, a Boston resident, said, “I’m not a writer, just a reader.” She added, “It’s been really great, because this is sort of the most literary event in the city. It’s such a city full of writers, and there are so many writers in Boston that write about Boston. It just makes me feel really good. So many people from all over this place write so many stories that make Boston what it is, and this event does a good job of celebrating this. It’s like my dream. I love it a lot.”
The true beauty of this event lies in how personable the authors were. Anyone could easily strike up a conversation with a recently published author, bridging the distance between the reader and the author behind a book. [Weike Wang ’10, the author of the recently released book “Chemistry,” gave her insight on what it means for her to be a writer: “When I started off as a freshman in college, I was wondering how writers did it. Now that I’m here, you don’t know that you’re doing it, when you’re doing it, you just end up there. It’s very heartwarming.” She gave a suggestion for aspiring writers: “Harvard has really great writing workshops. My passion for writing actually started and ballooned from there. When I was at Harvard, I didn’t know I would never have the same resources again.”
The event successfully showcased how writers and readers alike can thrive and prosper. Lasting several hours, it had multiple workshops for current and aspiring writers as well as discussions about different types of novels and types of writing, from Young Adult writing to writing from privilege.
Children were also prominently featured throughout the festival. Dana Eger, a member of the marketing team for Candlewick Press, said, “It’s great to actually see the kids who read our books. I don’t normally get to see the kids who read our books.”
An event filled with the hope of writers, intellectual vitality, and the innocence of childhood, the festival thrived. The Boston Book Festival was an accomplishment that successfully showed writers how to grow and be where they wanted to be, all while connecting readers to the creators of their favorite books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Victorian collaborators W. S. Gilbert (librettist) and Arthur Sullivan (composer) fit many details into their operettas, including their well-known “Pirates of Penzance: Or, The Slave of Duty.” The show features absurd twists and turns, pokes fun at blind British loyalty to the Queen, and crams in a multitude of tongue-twisting musical numbers that often leave singers breathless. There’s much for a cast and crew to explore.
To this already complex premise, however, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ staging of “Pirates,” which runs Oct. 27 through Nov. 5 in the Agassiz Theater, fast forwarded to the 1940s, keeping Gilbert and Sullivan’s music and lyrics but ditching pirates for mobsters with Brooklyn accents (“the Famiglia Pirata Mafia”).  Stage director Patrick Cressler ’20 also added a film noir varnish, using a foreshortened black-and-white set with pops of red in the main characters’ costumes. The over-the-top production asked much of its vocally talented and committed cast, and their performances, coupled with a skilled orchestra, triumphed. The production, at best, provided an evening of ridiculous comedic fun and, at worst, overwhelmed with the sheer pandemonium it presented.
In a nutshell, “Pirates” tells a story of Frederic (Samuel Rosner ’20), who is mistakenly apprenticed to a band of pirates/mobsters by his nurse, Ruth (Anna M. Schuliger ’20). At the end of his apprenticeship, on his 21st birthday, Frederic believes that his duty is to leave the mobsters and their buccaneering behind. He soon falls in love with Mabel (Arianna N. Paz ’19), but ensuing encounters with her father, General Stanley (Aaron A.G. Slipper ’18); the mobsters; and the police make it difficult for the lovers to sail sweetly into the sunset—or, in this case, to settle down in a Brooklyn brownstone.
The cast handled the knotty plot—all the more demanding because of the 1940s spin and requisite mobster accents—with compelling joy and pizzaz. Starting with her expository number, “When Fred’ric was a Little Lad,” Schuliger stole many of the show’s scenes with her bewitching command over the mobsters, her stealthy movements, and her excellent elocution. She didn’t take herself too seriously, making it easy for the audience to connect with her performance and the instructions which she misinterpreted to set the show’s events in motion:  “A sad mistake it was to make / And doom him to a vile lot. / I bound him to a pirate—you! / Instead of to a pilot.” Paz’s sparkling soprano and spunky take on Mabel shined in classic catchy songs like “Poor Wand’ring One” and “Stay, Fred’ric, Stay.” Slipper, too, seemed to be cut from G&S cloth and managed the verses of “I am the Very Model of a Modern Major General” with well-articulated finesse and comical calisthenics (which became increasingly strenuous as the song proceeded) in between verses. The ensemble’s vocals bolstered the production. Indeed, the stage often seemed too small for the boundless energy of the cast, not to mention their dance breaks (which were interspersed humorously, albeit unevenly, throughout the production).
“Pirates,” when done right, is a night of good fun. The show was lighthearted and enjoyable, but the disconnect between Gilbert & Sullivan’s Victorian dialogue and this production’s 1940s gloss was often distracting. In sections of Act II, for example, mobsters sometimes dropped their Brooklyn accents without rhyme or reason. And 1940s one-liners—“Never made a cannoli, am I right?” said Richard, a Pirate/Mobster King (Ryan Kapur ’20)—were funny but seemed slapdash, mismatched, and incidental to the story. The cast’s successful comedic timing, impressive vocal range, and dedication to their performances ultimately did not address this disconnect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Undergraduate Council released a survey to the student body in an effort to gauge student opinion ahead of the upcoming faculty vote on social group sanctions. However, the survey the UC has chosen to administer is so fundamentally flawed that it will do more harm than good in actually representing student opinion. In the best case, the release of this survey is grossly irresponsible; in the worst case, it is deliberately misleading.
My first concern is that the sampling method used in the survey is non-probabilistic: It has been sent to every undergraduate, each of whom must opt-in if they wish to take it. Since no demographic information is collected besides gender and class year, it will be impossible to turn the sample frame taken by the survey and generalize it to the overall student population. This will result in what pollsters call “sample frame error,” which alone would be enough to stop any good social scientist from trying to draw conclusions from the resulting data.
More worryingly, the UC survey is vulnerable to the phenomenon of “non-response bias,” which occurs when the respondents to a survey differ fundamentally from the non-respondents. Members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, a group which includes the UC president, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18, likely have significantly more motivation to fill out this survey than students who are not. Additionally, the fact that these groups are organized means that they can encourage participation among like-minded individuals and suggests that any results will be biased. Non-response bias can be mitigated in two ways: either with a representative, probability based sample or by achieving a response rate near 100 percent.
Since this survey does not employ a probabilistic sampling method, and does not collect nearly enough demographic information to accurately generalize its results, we must turn to the latter. The two most recent analogous surveys, in terms of the method of administration, are UC elections and the fall 2016 UC referendum on USGSO sanctions. UC elections have seen chronically low participation, and the fall 2016 referendum saw less than 50 percent turnout. There is no evidence that this survey will be immune to the same non-response bias.
Each method of minimizing non-response bias presents its own solution. The UC could conceivably sample from the student population randomly instead of through an opt-in method. Though a 100 percent response would still not be reached, the fundamental difference with this approach is that the responses and non-responses would both be randomly distributed. The current survey presents a way for institutions, like USGSOs, to amplify their voice relative to the rest of the student population in a way that would be impossible with a random sample. The other solution is to have the College make a survey question like this a part of spring check-in, thus making it mandatory for all students, and forcing a higher participation rate. With the faculty vote scheduled for November, this is currently untenable, but this could be an effective way to measure student opinion in the future.
Considering that Sachee is a member of a final club, and that both she and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 concentrate in Government, a department that mandates its undergraduates learn about good survey design (through either a Statistics course or department equivalent), the average student could be forgiven for viewing the survey’s methodology as a tactic to intentionally bias the results in a certain manner. I still believe it is important to assume best intentions. Sachee and Khansarinia’s goal is indeed admirable: The student voice must be heard in this debate. My apprehension lies not with their intentions, but with their methods.
The UC survey is so fundamentally flawed that it cannot produce the “updated pulse on what students want with regard to social groups” that it intends to measure. The faults are so blatant that Sachee and Khansarinia even mentioned them in a footnote to the email releasing the survey. The results might be biased towards pro-USGSO sentiments, but in an unmeasurable way. As such, the UC should cancel the survey and look into scientifically sound ways to measure student opinion. If none can be found, then no survey should be administered. Student voice is important, but only if it is accurately represented. If data cannot be trusted to accurately represent what students want, then it at best adds no value to the ongoing debate, and at worst it obscures the truth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, one of my classes was studying sexual orientation. Our required readings were laden with stereotypes about flamboyant gay men and butch lesbians, and ways to tell if your child is a “pre-homosexual.” There was even a joke about kids getting kicked out of the house thrown in at the end for good measure.
Naturally, I was not looking forward to section. Our Teaching Fellow started class with the disclaimer, “Assume best intentions, and say whatever’s on your mind.” Many students took his advice and spoke exactly what was on their minds, including bi-erasure, a strict gender binary, and the link between homosexuality and mental illness.
During a lull in the discussion, our TF proposed a thought experiment. The question was, “If scientists discovered that homosexuality is innate, does that mean that homosexuality is then moral, and that gay people deserve equal rights?” Yep, the thought experiment was on the completely unrealistic and inconceivable topic of the morality of LGBTQ people and our right to equal protection under the law. Never debated that one before. Luckily, someone piped up, “Shouldn’t they deserve equal rights anyway?” to which the TF responded, “That’s not what I’m asking.”
I’m sure that for some cis straight people in that room, this was just a fun little thought experiment about the circumstances under which equal protection applies. Was the topic sensitive? Sure. Was it still valid? Eh, probably.
But not for me, and probably not for any other queer people in the room. I’ve debated this for hours with family members. I’ve cited statistics, provided personal anecdotes, and looked up Bible verses. I’ve sobbed in despair over this and celebrated even the smallest victories. This is anything but a fun little thought experiment for me. It’s my life, which should not be up for debate. In the same way that it’d be ridiculous for the TF to ask our class whether women deserve the right to vote or whether black people deserve the right to own property, it’s ridiculous to ask whether LGBTQ people deserve equal rights. The answer is yes; end of debate.
I’ll bet most cis straight people left class feeling a little uncomfortable, but mostly fine. I doubt that many spent much time dwelling on it. That’s the thing about privilege: Those who have it often don’t realize it. (If you think you don’t have any privileges, think a little harder.) But, for every moment where privileged people have been comfortably unaware of their unearned benefits, marginalized people have felt unwelcome and unsafe. Every day, privileged people benefit from the oppression of the marginalized and often perpetuate this oppression in their words and actions, even without realizing it. But that’s not to say that we should all just feel guilty for our privileges. Guilt won’t break down structural oppression. Intentional actions will.
Allyship isn’t a state of being; it’s a state of doing. If the thought of speaking out against oppression or conceding space at the table makes you uncomfortable, you’re probably on the right track. Allyship isn’t meant to be comfortable. No one gets brownie points for doing the bare minimum by staying in their comfort zone. And the convenient thing about allyship is that you can choose to back out of that discomfort any time. Marginalized people don’t get the privilege of backing out of their own oppression.
So what are some concrete ways to work towards better allyship? For starters, listen more. Too often, privileged people are used to having their voices heard, and that can lead to an echo chamber where they only hear from those like them. If a marginalized person is talking about their experiences, listen to understand, not to immediately offer solutions or opinions.
Paired with knowing when to listen is knowing when to speak up. It can be exhausting for marginalized people to have to constantly defend their existence, so it’s a big help when allies point out problematic behaviors and help educate other privileged people. That’s not to say that allies should be at the forefront of any movement for equality or talking over marginalized people—there’s a fine line between standing with someone in solidarity and taking up space in a movement not centered around you.
Always be willing to improve. If someone points out that you’ve messed up, take the feedback and change your actions accordingly. Don’t get defensive and excuse your behavior by claiming, “But I’m an ally!” There’s always room for improvement, and we should all be actively seeking out ways to become better allies. If we remain stagnant in our allyship, we’ll become complicit in the very systems we want to change.
Allyship must happen everywhere, including the classroom. If a professor, TF, or student says something oppressive, speak up. Some people are upfront about their disagreement; others “push back” by providing a different perspective, or ask pointed questions to encourage them to reconsider their initial statements. However you address it, know that letting an oppressive statement slip by perpetuates the normalization of marginalization and makes targeted students feel unsafe. Students who feel unsafe may not feel like they’re in the position to speak up, which makes it even more important for allies to use their privilege and say something.
I’m incredibly grateful for the student who pointed out the problem with my TF’s thought experiment. While I don’t know whether the student was queer or an ally, it was comforting to know that there was someone else in the room who also felt disturbed by the idea of a class debate on the legal rights of LGBTQ people. For that brief moment, I didn’t feel pressured to be the sole person to defend my existence. I felt a little bit safer and a lot more welcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, sent out a survey to the undergraduate body hoping to measure student opinion on the administration’s handling of Harvard’s social club penalties.  This student input would then be relayed to the Faculty as another source of information as they deliberate on the recently proposed policy to prohibit all students from joining such a group.
First and foremost, we appreciate this effort to gauge student opinion.  As these proposed policies will primarily affect students at the College, it makes sense that we should have the opportunity to voice our opinions on the subject.  Indeed, the fact that this responsibility has fallen to the UC demonstrates the administration’s failure to seriously consider the input of the student body.
However, it is important that these results accurately reflect the views of undergraduates. We urge Sachee and Khansarinia to take into consideration the statistical limitations of their survey and to be completely transparent with the results. Data about response rates and the demographic distribution of their survey should be made public.  We also hope that they will present to the Faculty and others a balanced assortment of qualitative responses that most accurately represent the views of the student body.
The statistical consequences of the methodological approach to the administration of their survey should also be considered as the UC evaluates the results.  As Sachee and Khansarinia admit in their email, by polling the entire student population, those with a vested interest will be more likely to respond.  It is important that the UC understand and admit these limitations.
Finally, we hope the UC leadership will continue to consider and assess the opinion of the student body, perhaps in ways that enable students to provide still more nuanced feedback.  Though the survey’s option for open-ended feedback is appreciated, the hard statistics are produced by a severely restricted set of multiple choice questions.  With only three proposed solutions and three possible responses, students are limited in their ability to express their views.  The gravity of this issue requires a more rigorous approach in evaluating student opinion.
We are glad students can express their thoughts on an issue as serious as the sanctions. To the end, this survey will be most effective with a larger response rate, so we encourage all students to take it.  And we encourage the UC to understand the consequences if many students do not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee searching for Harvard’s next president is narrowing its hundreds-strong candidate pool and has started compiling a select list of potential presidents, according to two individuals with knowledge of the search.
The 15-member committee has received more than 600 total recommendations for candidates to date, according to an email sent over the Harvard Latino Alumni Alliance list summarizing a meeting between Latino alumni leaders and Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow.  While the committee is still accepting nominations, the two sources said the group is now honing in on a smaller list, though they could not confirm its exact length.
Although the search committee has repeatedly declined to comment on the search’s progress, several prominent donors and professors at Harvard say there are four likely contenders from within the University: Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation declined to comment on the number or identity of candidates the committee is considering.
Michael T. Kerr ’81, one of the co-chairs of the Harvard College Fund Executive Committee who said he knows many search committee members “very well,” named the four as candidates the committee will likely consider closely.
“From what I can tell those are the names that everybody thinks are on the shortlist of the internal people, and we’ll see what list comes beyond that,” Kerr said, referring to Nohria, Allen, Smith, and Garber.
“In this type of search, there’s always a shorter list that’s more obvious,” Kerr added.
More than a dozen alumni and professors mentioned Nohria as a potential frontrunner. Nohria became the dean of the Business School in 2010; since then, he has helped raise more than $1 billion for the Business School’s capital campaign and has overseen a drive to increase gender equity at the school.
Nohria declined to comment on whether he is interested in serving as successor to University President Drew G. Faust, who announced over the summer that she plans to step down in June 2018.
When asked whether Harvard’s next president should have a background in engineering, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III said no—but, unprompted, pointed out that Nohria has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who said he is very close to Nohria personally, declined to comment on whether he thinks Nohria would be well-suited for the presidency in an interview last week. He also declined to say whether Nohria has ever expressed interest in the position.
“That question is best addressed toward Dean Nohria,” Khurana said.

Allen, who heads the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, became a University Professor—the highest honor bestowed upon a Harvard faculty member—less than two years after arriving at Harvard. In recent months, she has assumed increased responsibility on campus, serving as co-chair of a high-profile University task force focused on diversity and wading into the ongoing debate on undergraduate social life.
“I think there’s no question she would be a strong candidate,” Kerr said of Allen.
When asked about the presidency, Allen laughed. “I’ve got the perfect job,” she said. “That’s my comment.”
Donors said Smith and Garber, both high-level Harvard administrators, are strong contenders for the position and are widely respected by Harvard affiliates. Faust appointed Smith, a computer scientist, to the position early in her tenure. He has overseen major projects like the renewal of Harvard’s undergraduate Houses and the expansion of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
In an interview last month, Smith said he did not know if the search committee is considering him for the job.
“You’d have to ask the search committee,” he said. Smith said that when the search committee meets with the Faculty Council, FAS’s highest governing body, he and other administrators are asked to leave the room.
Garber, who taught medicine and economics for two and a half decades at Stanford before returning to Harvard, has served as University Provost since 2011. He did not respond to a request for comment.
As the committee begins to whittle down its list of candidates, members are traveling to cities across the country to meet with local alumni associations. During the 2000 search, the search committee publicly announced at a news conference that they had developed a list of 400 candidates. This time around, though, the committee has proven more tight-lipped.
“We have no indication that there will be any such public announcement this time around,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an email.
A member of the committee met with leaders of the capital campaign, Harvard’s record-setting fundraising effort, on Oct. 17 in New York City to discuss the search, according to Kerr.
“They’re doing those meetings with alumni in small groups—particularly with the alumni which are highly active,” Kerr said.
Kerr said the search committee member leading the meeting did not name individual candidates under consideration. He said the purpose of the meeting was to define which issues alumni and searchers should focus on.
Presidential search experts and Harvard affiliates have said Harvard’s next president will need to tackle several different challenges as he or she assumes office—including reshaping social life at the College, lobbying the federal government, growing Harvard’s engineering profile, and managing the University’s embattled finances.

As Amazon scours North America for a site for its second headquarters, Harvard experts in urban planning, technology, and sociology say the tech titan's potential landing in Boston would have likely deep ramifications for the city—both good and bad.
Harvard plays a prominent role in Boston's pitch to Amazon, with the city touting its "intellectual infrastructure" and sizable supply of skilled workers. University President Drew G. Faust, in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, further entreated the e-commerce giant to select the Boston area for its $5 billion "HQ2."
Some Harvard professors and administrators said they support the city's bid, noting that it could bring many new jobs to the Boston area and spark new collaborations with Harvard's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Others, however, worried that the firm’s presence in the area could drive up real estate prices and drive out longtime residents.
SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said he was “without a doubt” excited by the proposal. One of the supplementary sites proposed for Amazon’s new headquarters in Boston is located near Harvard's future science and engineering complex in Allston, set to open in the fall of 2020.
“I’ve had some nice interactions with Jeff [Bezos]’s team and other interactions that really have served to bring us closer to Amazon and more importantly get us on the radar of Amazon as a place to recruit our students for internships, for regular jobs, and to get our faculty connected on research projects,” Doyle said. “So I think we will be doing, independent of where Headquarters 2 lands, we will be doing more in closer collaboration with Amazon.”
Monica G. Tibbits-Nutt, a freshman proctor who sits on the board of the MBTA, said she was optimistic that the arrival of Amazon could bolster the economy of Boston more broadly.
"For Massachussetts, any time you can bring a company of that size headquarters to the city, from an economic development standpoint that’s an amazing opportunity," Tibbits-Nutt said.
But other faculty members were less enthusiastic about the bid. James G. Stockard Jr., a lecturer on urban planning at the Graduate School of Design, argued that the creation of 50,000 jobs from HQ2 could put a major strain on housing in the area.
“I’m quite sure there won’t be 50,000 brand new people, but if it’s only 25,000 people, that’s still a rather huge number of new residents in the Boston area and our state suffers quite dramatically from a shortage of housing that’s affordable in all but the very highest income ranges,” said Stockard.
Stockard said that if Amazon were to locate its offices in Boston, the city would need to overhaul its approach to affordable housing so that Bostonians will not be priced out of their homes.
“It’s simply unhealthy for a metropolitan area like Boston to not provide adequate housing for the people,” he said. “If we don’t supply homes for those people, we create a questionable economy in the long run.”
Amazon has received 238 proposals for its second headquarters, and has said it expects to reach a decision next year. And while Boston faces steep competition from cities like Denver, Colo., Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C., sociology lecturer David Luberoff said the city has a good shot at landing HQ2 if Amazon prioritizes human capital.
“I’d be very surprised if Boston doesn’t make it through—at least to the very next round,” Luberoff, who teaches a course on Boston, said. “If the major issue for Amazon is access to talent, then this is a very serious bid. If the major issue for Amazon is going be the cheapest cost… then Boston doesn’t have a shot. And Boston knows that."

Trumpeter and composer Wynton L. Marsalis improvised some blues with the Harvard Jazz Band before reflecting on the value of education for both the arts and society with University President Drew G. Faust in a crowded Sanders Theatre Monday night.
Marsalis was celebrating the video release of “Music as Metaphor”, the first in a series of six combined lectures and performances he gave at Harvard between 2011 and 2014. The world-renowned artist has won nine Grammy Awards for both his jazz and classical performances.
English professors Stephen J. Greenblatt and Jorie Graham introduced the event with praise of music education and its advocates, specifically mentioning Faust and Marsalis.
Greenblatt welcomed Marsalis as “one of the most intellectually exuberant and generous of the great artists who has contributed so much in recent years to Harvard.”
Following their comments, Yosvany Terry, a Music lecturer and Jazz Ensembles director, brought up six undergraduates to play for the audience and then joined in himself, beating a drum and singing along to a traditional West African song.
Marsalis then took the stage, greeted the members of the Jazz Band with hugs, and surprised the audience by taking out his own trumpet to accompany trumpeter Miranda Agnew ’21 in improvisational blues.
Beginning their conversation, Faust recapped Marsalis’s previous appearances at Harvard then asked questions about the value of music and education.
"The value of education and of knowledge is that you become aware of things and ways you can become more powerful," Marsalis said.
Throughout the event, Faust played clips from videos of Marsalis’s previous lectures.
“There are essences in our music that testify to a single national identity and it took generations of struggles to bind them,” Marsalis said in one clip. “Meaning is the essence of the art, and art is the essence of the people.”
Marsalis also talked about the impact of technology in education and society, and noted its effects on the music industry.
“A lot of people aren’t even playing; they've all got earplugs in,” he said. “They’re musicians. What do you need earplugs for if you’re a musician? You need to hear. Then they hire people to fake like they’re playing.”
At the beginning of his talk, Marsalis joked that he would never get a job at Harvard. After thanking him for his contributions over the years, Faust joked in kind and said, “you’re hired.”
Marsalis has won awards including the National Humanities Medal, the National Medal of the Arts, membership in the British Royal Academy of Music, and membership in the French Legion of Honor. Harvard awarded him an honorary doctorate for his contributions to the field of music in 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council discussed the search for Harvard’s next president with Shirley M. Tilghman, a member of the presidential search committee, on Oct. 25.
In an interview Monday, UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said Tilghman—Princeton's former president and a member of the Harvard Corporation—updated both himself and UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 on the search committee's progress. The UC has also engaged with the search's Student Advisory Committee, meeting with three of its members during Sunday night’s general meeting.
Echoing other members of the search committee—a 15-member body composed of Corporation members and Overseers—Tilghman told UC leaders that the search for University President Drew G. Faust's replacement was still in an information-gathering phase, according to Khansarinia.
“They've been meeting across the country with lots of different stakeholders,” he said. “They have a lot of great people that they’re considering and they've just been meeting and getting suggestions from very many people.”
Khansarinia said the two shared names of candidates they’d like to be considered with Tilghman, though he declined to comment on the particular names. The pair also spoke about the characteristics they hope to see in Harvard’s next president.
“We said that we wanted the next president to continue President Faust’s amazing kind of reckoning with Harvard’s history and focus on diversity, inclusion, and belonging in the way that she has handled issues of, for example, slavery or undocumented students or minority students,” he said. “We hope that the next president will kind of pick up that torch and carry it forward.”
Khansarinia also said that he and Sachee emphasized the need to maintain Harvard’s leading status among universities.
“We hope that the next president will continue to keep Harvard as number one. Obviously there are other peer institutions that are increasingly getting better, but the president's job is to keep Harvard the best universtiy it can be,” he said.
Khansarinia said he and Sachee identified key “challenges” Harvard could face in the coming years, including issues surrounding free speech on college campuses, the Allston campus expansion, and the “One Harvard” initiative.
Days after the meeting with Tilghman, the UC at large met with the three undergraduate members of the student advisory committee—Federico Roitman ’18, Nathaniel Vincent ’20, and Nina Srivastava ’18.
Numerous members said they wanted Harvard’s next president to value diversity.
“An opportunity for the next president going forward will be to really carry the torch of making institutions of higher learning across America inclusive places,” Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 said.
Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman '20 said she hopes the next president will build a multicultural center on campus, a long-standing priority for some students. Rules Committee Chair Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said he hopes the next president will emphasize the need for public service across the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students enter the basement of Quincy House this Halloween, they’ll find something even scarier than juniors cramming for midterms: Since Sunday, the space has been transformed into “A Nightmare on Plympton Street.”
Four roommates in Quincy—Jonas M. Aranda '18, Louis J. Colson '18, Garrett Wen '18, and Max Y. Hsiao '18—organized an event that transformed the basement into a haunted house.
Sheets dyed with fake blood hang from fishing wire divide the room, cobweb-covered exam practice books sit on a desk, and spooky sound effects play in the background.
“It's a dorm room-theme haunted house, so you get to go visit a living room, a bedroom, a study hall room;  there are a lot of Harvard jokes in the room as well—part of it is like the MCATs are coming,”  Wen said,  referring to notoriously difficult medical school entrance exam.
Aranda said that he and his roommates developed the idea because they enjoyed scaring Wen.
“We thought it be a cool idea to scare other people in the basement; so far it’s gone really well,” Aranda said.
Quincy Faculty Deans Deborah J. Gehrke and Lee Gehrke hosted a “spooky open house” Sunday night in their residence when the basement haunted house was only open to Quincy residents. According to Colson, the Gehrkes helped them market the haunted house by sending people down to the basement from the event.
“They really thought about it. They’re hanging sheets, they put blood in the right places, they put music in the right places, they come out and scare you in the right places,” Deborah Gehrke said. “It is scary.”
Students who passed through the haunted house seemed to agree: Jillian A. Scyocurka '18 described the experience as “nail-biting, teeth-chattering," and Charlotte H. Davis '19 added that it was “earth-breaking, never-done-that-before, one-of-a-kind.”
Wen said that he had previous experience working with haunted houses.
“In high school, I used to volunteer in a haunted house in my town, so I had a lot of experience with designing rooms, and hidden compartments, and ways to scare people,” he said. “We were able to turn a very small room into a complex maze.”
But Aranda said the group had to readjust after the first night.
“We had to make some renovations because someone pulled everything down. They were too scared,” he said.
Wen said that he hopes the haunted house becomes an annual tradition.
“We really want as many people to stop by—just have a good five minutes of fun,” Colson said. “We just want as many people to come down and enjoy themselves.”
The haunted house will close at 11 p.m. on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a year when most institutional investors rode out robust public markets, Harvard’s 8.1 percent investment return for fiscal year 2017 placed it last among Ivy League endowments.
Dartmouth, which has one of the smallest endowments in the Ivy League at $4.96 billion, did the best during the year. Its 14.6 percent return, buoyed by strong growth in public equities, grew its endowment to the largest it has ever been.
Yale, often the leader of Ivy League endowments, came in seventh place this year with an 11.3 percent investment return. Experts attribute it to the university’s heavy investment in alternative assets which, they argue, buffer Yale from an unexpected swings in the market or financial crashes.
While most Ivy League endowments were able to capitalize on the bull market in fiscal year 2017, Harvard’s performance was weighed down by a series of high-value markdowns it took on some of its investments. The University’s financial report, released last week, detailed a nearly $10 billion markdown on domestic fixed income assets, which include investments like treasury bonds, junk bonds, and corporate bonds.
It was a surprisingly high markdown for Charles A. Skorina, a financial headhunter who often analyzes the performance of institutional investors. He said the size of the markdown indicates that Harvard Management Company’s new CEO, N.P. Narvekar, has recognized that the portfolio was poorly constructed.
“You seldom see that,” Skorina said. “We usually see markdowns when the market crashes. If they’re writing down stuff, there must’ve been just awful stuff in their portfolio.”
Skorina added that Narvekar likely “bit the bullet,” intentionally setting the markdowns in his first year of leadership so any damaging assets won’t affect future years of performance.
“Narv’s smart. Better to take the big write off now and have nice returns after,” Skorina said. “Everyone will forgive you for the early years if you perform well.”
Narvekar said the firm will spend the next few years “repositioning” its portfolio in his annual endowment report. In some cases, that might mean selling off assets, as HMC has done with some private equity and natural resources investments. In others, the firm might simply mark down an asset. For the fiscal year, Harvard marked down its natural resources portfolio by $1 billion.
The changes are part of an ambitious restructuring Narvekar has launched since he started his tenure in January to address “deep structural problems at HMC.”
David E. Kaiser ’69, an alum who has regularly criticized the firm and pushed for it to become more transparent, said Narvekar’s letter was “the first time that anybody in authority at HMC or the University has admitted that something is seriously wrong, which had been fairly clear for some time.”
These returns mark the first under Narvekar’s leadership, but because he took the helm of the firm in the middle of the fiscal year, next year’s returns may provide a fuller picture of HMC’s performance with him in charge.
Narvekar led Columbia University’s endowment during the first part of the fiscal year. It returned 13.7 percent, the third best in the Ivy League.

When Tommy Amaker took a job as the head coach of the men’s basketball team, he was the first black head coach at Harvard in 16 years.
A decade—and several March Madness appearances—later, Amaker is one of only four head coaches across the University’s 42 varsity teams who are people of color. And while the department has added two African American senior administrators to its ranks in recent years, minority representation remains low among the more than 80 assistant and volunteer coaches in the department. The Athletics Department does not release specific demographic data on its staff.
For Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise, there’s clear room for improvement.
“We are disappointed at the lack of progress we have made in improving diversity in the athletic department,” Scalise wrote in an emailed statement. “We are working to address any inequities, recruit and retain a diverse staff, and create an environment where all our student-athletes feel supported and our coaches and staff feel respected.”
But as the Athletics Department takes new steps to build a more diverse staff—and reflect a student body where the majority of the freshman class is nonwhite—it faces a series of challenges that coaches, players, and administrators alike said slows progress.  A combination of low compensation for assistant and volunteer coaches, the high cost of living in Boston, and a certain “stigma” associated with Harvard have kept hiring among nonwhite coaches low, they said.
“I think being recruited, you definitely take into account: ‘Who am I going to be surrounded by in most of my time?’ because you do spend a majority of time with your team, and in the Athletics Department,” said Sydney E. Skinner ’19, a member of the women’s basketball team. “So I definitely did take that into consideration.”
Not that Harvard is the only Ivy League athletic department that has grappled with issues of diversity.
In a recent report on women’s collegiate athletics produced by the Tucker Center for Research on Girls and Women in Sport and The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, the Ivy League was one of four athletics conferences to receive an “F” for racial diversity—according to the report, only 8.6 percent of coaches of Ivy League women’s teams were nonwhite.
According to Richard E. Lapchick, director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, this was the first year conferences had received an “F” in the history of his organization’s reporting.
In an October interview, Scalise said there have been few open head coaching positions in recent years, making it difficult to hire a more diverse cadre of coaches. Still, he praised the progress to department has started to make.
“We haven’t had a lot of positions open up that are possible, I’m actually very pleased that we’ve made good progress,” he said. “We have James [Frazier]. We have Tommy [Amaker]. We have Ted Minnis and no one has a person of color coaching water polo in the country. We have Traci Green who is a female African American head coach in our league. Again, I think we are doing better than most of the other places in our league.”
Amaker, Minnis, and Green declined to comment for this story. Minnis coaches both men’s and women’s water polo, while Green heads the women’s tennis team.
Scalise said the department aims to hire more minority candidates in assistant coaching, volunteer, and senior administrative roles.
“We have a few assistant coaches, but I’d like to see more assistant coaches, have more diversity there,” he said. “Two of our senior staff members are African Americans, and I think that that, in a sense, is good progress but it’s not enough progress, so that’s why I’m disappointed.”
The Athletics Department does not release data on the demographics of their staff. Unlike the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, both of which regularly publish detailed demographic data, Scalise said the department “informally tracks” staff diversity.
“We also look at diversity in very broad terms,” Scalise added. “So yes, we do look at ethnic diversity, but we look at diversity very broadly.”
Scalise also said that Athletics will be coordinating with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ human resources office to broaden the department’s future job searches.
Harvard’s head of strength and conditioning James L. Frazier, who has been involved in a number of staff search committees, said that while Athletics tries to cast a wide net, many minority candidates “don’t seem to be interested in coming.”
During his nearly decade-long time at Harvard, Frazier said he has only had two minority interns within his own program, adding that most minority candidates went on to take jobs at bigger schools with larger athletics departments. Frazier also pointed to a “stigma” around Harvard, as a historically predominantly white institution, as a possible detractor for minority candidates.
Scalise acknowledged that Harvard’s reputation as a predominantly white school could undercut minority recruitment efforts.
“We’ve made a couple of offers to candidates of color, and they’ve turned us down,” he said. “In the backs of their minds that could be something they’re considering.”
Scalise also pointed to the relatively high cost of living in Boston and the relatively low wages available for coaching positions.
Women’s basketball head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said recruiting diverse coaches at the assistant and volunteer levels remains a challenge largely because of financial considerations.
Delaney-Smith explained that much of the department’s hiring happens internally, with unpaid interns or volunteers eventually moving up into assistant or senior roles. However, Delaney-Smith said, attracting candidates from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to unpaid or lower paying positions to begin with is difficult.
“It’s hard for my volunteers over the years to live in one of the most expensive cities in the world,” she said. “And honestly, and Bob [Scalise] knows this, but I think salaries need to get better because sometimes we’ll have really quality coaches that we can’t get because we aren’t competitive with the other schools that we are recruiting against or we can’t keep them long.”
According to publically-available statistics from the U.S. Department of Education, assistant coaches for Harvard men’s teams made $53,983 on average in the 2015-2016 year. The average assistant coach for a women’s teams earned $39,006.
Delaney-Smith also pointed to a lack of of benefits for assistant and volunteer coaches, explaining that some of her coaches do not have access to parking at the Athletics complex.
The department is currently conducting a review of the way it compensates its coaches. Starting in November, the department will also begin unconscious bias trainings for its staff and coaches, following a department-wide cultural review.
In the meantime, a lack of diversity in coaching may also affect recruiting: Several athletes said they considered departmental diversity before committing to Harvard.
Chris E. Egi ’18, a member of the men’s basketball team, echoed Frazier’s concerns about a certain “stigma” around Harvard, crediting Amaker with battling these perceptions.
“So there’s a little bit of that stigma of this elite kind of institution that doesn’t necessarily fit into basketball culture, and I think that’s a stigma we’re still battling today,” Egi said. “But I think Coach Amaker has really done a great job of challenging that and showing that Harvard can be a place for anybody regardless of socioeconomic status, race, and where you’re from.”  
Amaker is known for his monthly “breakfast clubs,” during which he meets with a number of predominantly African American scholars, entrepreneurs, and professionals from throughout the Boston area to talk about current events, politics, and sports.
“Having a black man in a position of power like that, especially the way our coach in particular interacts with the community here, I think it means a lot in terms of pushing boundaries and taking those steps,” said Egi.
Skinner—who, along with Egi and football player Tanner J. Lee ’18, praised the department’s diversity efforts—pointed out that while some sports are traditionally less diverse than others because of costs or a lack of opportunity in certain regions, having greater representation of people of color is key to supporting student athletes across the board.
“I think increasing the amount of exposure that people of color do have in higher places of power in the Athletics Department is always a good thing to see,” she said. “I think it’s beneficial to the school and athletes themselves because as a person of color, having people who look like me and have similar backgrounds to me, makes my experience and how I feel about the sport I am playing so much better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a series that began on Sunday and will continue through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. Coming in at No. 12 is Holy Cross.
No. 13: MIT
Holy Cross
2017-2018 Matchup: Thursday, November 16 at Hart Center, Worcester, Mass. (7:00 p.m)
2016-2017 Record: 15-17 overall, 9-9 Patriot League
2016-2017 Matchup: Holy Cross, 63, Harvard, 52
Head Coach: Bill Carmody (3rd season)
Key Returning Players: junior forward Karl Charles (team’s top returning scorer (9.4) and rebounder (3.3)), junior guard Patrick Benzan (averaged nearly 30 minutes a contest off the bench a season ago, the undersized Benzan will likely take over as the team’s lead guard)
Stat to Watch: 15.9: The Crusaders forced an average of 15.9 turnovers per contest last season, including 19 against Harvard. Charles and Benzan lead a strong perimeter defense for a team that will struggle to score.
Overview: Holy Cross handed Harvard arguably its most embarrassing loss a season ago and the Crusaders have been a thorn in Amaker’s side in recent years (the Crimson has dropped the last three matchups). This year’s Holy Cross roster does not feature a single senior and has nine underclassmen. As always, the Crusaders’ slow pace will make Harvard grind this one out. However, if Harvard can score 60 points against Carmody’s young bunch, it may prove to be too much for the hosts.
