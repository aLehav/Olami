After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Complete with a picture from one of the many car rides my family and I take together, this playlist reminds me of something my dad always says, “Home is when the five of us are in this car together.” Home is a complicated word in my family because none of us has quite felt it. Born in the UK, with an American accent, of a Palestinian and Italian heritage, I have never felt I belonged to a place. I’m out of place in London with my generic American accent; I’m out of place in America with no citizenship; and Palestine and Italy are distant and unfamiliar to me. For me, home is on the road with my family.
The songs in this playlist aren’t necessarily associated with the word “home,” but they bring me memories of bickering in the back seats, frustration with missed highway exits, and a distinct Sousou car smell of coffee and mentos. When I was little, my brothers and I sat obediently in the back seat wishing for top pop chart songs by Taylor Swift and Sean Paul, but little did we know, we were being musically educated by the great names of the musical world.
Creedence Clearwater, Fleetwood Mac, and James Taylor are three of many artists that I slowly learned to appreciate, and soon enough, love. Whenever “Susie Q” by Creedence Clearwater came on I would roll my eyes, but my parents would crank up the volume, belt the lyrics, and hum the instrumentals.
Fleetwood Mac’s "Rumors" would always, without fail, be prefaced with my father saying, “I would listen to this album on repeat in college.” At the time, I wanted to listen to the angst on Avril Lavigne’s album “The Best Damn Thing,” but now “Rumors” is an album I often turn to for comfort.
Roads is a playlist that signifies home. The classics on the playlist will always be the five of us driving anywhere on the road feeling like we belong to Creedence Clearwater, Fleetwood Mac, James Taylor, the Eagles, Neil Young, and many more.

John Hancock – graduate of Harvard College Class of 1754, revolutionary leader, president of the Second Continental Congress, and first signatory of the Declaration of Independence – was also the Treasurer of Harvard University beginning in 1773.
Hancock was in charge of the University’s financial accounts and was supposed to give then-University President Samuel Langdon reports on the state of the treasury, especially for the semiannual meeting of the Overseers of the University.
But once his patriotic duties came calling, barely a year after his appointment, Hancock abandoned the post without officially resigning. He took with him large sums of money, about £15,000 in cash and securities, and important information about the University’s financial accounts, sparking a back-and-forth between Hancock and Langdon that would continue for several years.
In November 1774 and January 1775, Langdon sent Hancock two letters reminding him of his duties as treasurer, but to little avail – Hancock didn’t respond until months later in March 1775.
Hancock may have been involved in the fight for the creation of our nation, but Harvard wanted its money and its report on the treasury.
At first, Langdon was relatively understanding of Hancock’s critical role in the Revolution and dealt with him patiently. “We are very unhappy in being again & again disappointed of an opportunity of setting our Treasurer’s Accompts,” Langdon stated in a letter to Hancock in April of 1775. “We know your Patriotic exertions in your Country’s cause, & are willing to allow much to this plea for the delay of our affairs hiterho.”
But if Hancock did not back down to the power of the British Empire, he certainly would not give up easily in a fight with a mere university president. Just days before the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired in April 1775, Hancock found the time to scribble a response to Langdon’s complaints.
“He is much surprised & astonished at the contents of the President’s letter as the doing of the gentlemen present, which he very seriously resents,” Hancock wrote, referring to himself in the third person.
By March 1776, the Revolution had arrived at Harvard in full force. By this time, it had been over a year since Hancock had abandoned his role as treasurer, and Langdon was fed up. He penned a letter to Hancock describing the damages inflicted upon the University and imploring his return so that the financial situation could be addressed.
​​​​​​
“The buildings are stores & barracks, their beauty is defaced, & it will be so long before the wastes, breaches, & ruins can be repaired...” Langdon wrote. “But, for want of access to our Treasury, nothing can either be receiv’d or pay’d out for defraying the current expenses of the Society.”
Hancock, preoccupied with the burdens of helping lead a country in its revolution, did not immediately reply. Langdon sent a follow-up letter a month later, reminding Hancock of his duties to Harvard and “renewing his urgent request to hear from [Hancock] speedily.”
Hancock responded with a flourish of platitudinal apologies, and offered to have another interim treasurer installed while he organized the forces of the Revolution. Langdon responded gravely: "you yourself, Sir must judge how far it may be consistent with your other Employments to continue in so important of Office of the College."
The stalemate in the battle between Hancock and Langdon pressed on. As Langdon became increasingly frustrated with Hancock’s dismissal of his responsibilities at Harvard, Hancock was signing America into independence and managing the Continental Congress as the British seized New York. By February 1777, Langdon was so infuriated that he wrote a 24 page letter to Hancock detailing all the ways he had failed to fulfill the job’s requirements.The game Langdon had been playing with Hancock was over — he was ready for an all out fight.
Hancock was not amused. Punctuating his irreverent letter with liberal underlining, he began by calling out “... the Corporation of Harvard College, of which I was once respected as a member.” Hancock made clear his displeasure with Langdon and the Harvard Corporation in a sophisticated clapback: “Surely I did not run away with the Property of the College,” he wrote, “no gentlemen, I sowed it.”
Hancock ultimately gave more than £16,000 back to the University, but did not pay interest on the money he had held nor did he turn over all of the treasury records. The Corporation was enraged.
In January of 1778, almost a year later, the Harvard Corporation received a curt letter from Hancock, who had recently learned from a newspaper notice in another state that Ebenezer Storer had been appointed as Harvard’s treasurer.
“A few days ago before my departure from Congress,” Hancock wrote to the corporation, “a Boston newspaper announced my dismission from the honorary appointment of College Treasurer...”
This advertisement, he wrote, “is the only information I have ever had of my dismission.”
His anger is only barely contained by his heavy handed script. It is hard to decide which is more unbelievable: that Hancock didn’t anticipate his removal or that Harvard waited over a year following their altercation to enact it.
Harvard’s financial records may not have had the same nationwide impact as the Declaration of Independence, but his famed signature still graces them both. And while he may have created a new country through the Revolutionary War , he didn’t escape the watchful eye of Samuel Langdon unscathed.

“Please indicate how you identify yourself.”
A version of this request appears on standardized tests, government forms, and medical questionnaires. To some, this is little more than another bubble to fill on a fifteen-page form or test. But do these multiple choice options oversimplify the nuances of one’s racial identity? Since the introduction of the Data Equity Bill in January —officially called Massachusetts Bill H.2681 — Massachusetts advocates have debated this question.
Most recently, this debate continued at the first hearing for the Data Equity Bill on Oct. 15 at the State House. Filed by Representative Tackey Chan, the bill mandates state agencies to collect additional racial demographic data by giving survey takers the option to further specify their racial identity⁠—including options like Vietnamese, Cambodian, Chinese, Puerto Rican, or Dominican. The bill aims to provide additional information that nonprofit organizations and official agencies can use to better allocate their funds toward specific populations’ needs.
Chan proposed the bill with the goal that it will facilitate better representation for Asian American constituents. As a Chinese American, Chan said he has experienced the consequences of the model minority myth — the generalized assumption that Asian Americans have higher socioeconomic success — first-hand. Chan explains that aggregate data “will show, for example, that [Asian Americans] have higher educational attention levels but, in reality, when you break into those subsets, the Vietnamese and Cambodians have lower graduation rates and access to higher university.”
“These stereotypes only hurt us,” says Chan.
Without more specific data, government programs are unable to fulfill the particular needs of the communities they serve, Chan says. For instance, Meals on Wheels, a program that delivers daily hot meals to seniors who are unable to prepare their own meals, serves seniors the same meal regardless of their cultural backgrounds and tastes. Chan explains that many Asian Americans have petitioned to the program to be sensitive of culturally-specific palates.
“Everyone deserves the same equal treatment, but we don't have cultural competency and knowledge of our different segments as well as the identification of need,” he says.
Following in the footsteps of states like California, which passed a similar bill in 2016, Chan intends for the Data Equity Bill to be inclusive of every demographic so representatives can better identify the specific areas of need in their districts. In the long term, he believes that increasing available data can be used to discern “patterns” that will help combat issues like racial profiling and police brutality.
For many, however, the effort to accrue and index more information about race poses a question about what the government will do with this data. According to an article from the Patriot Ledger, one speaker at Tuesday’s hearing was concerned that the bill would give the government “new [race-based] labels to apply” that could further racial discrimination.
Senator Dean A. Tran, a major voice of opposition against the bill, believes it will only further divide and segregate an already disconnected Asian American community. A Vietnamese American who emigrated to the United States at the age of four, Tran explains that this bill is an issue close to heart. “The one thing I’m most proud of is that I represent the entire Asian American community.”
If Asian American is split into multiple, disparate identities through data representation, Tran worries that the amount of aid money given to Asian American groups won’t increase, but that each newly divided subgroup will get a small, insufficient portion of it.
“The reality is that [a subgroup] is not going to be recognized,” says Tran. “Our goal is to make the Asian American community stronger and more influential, and this bill does the opposite.”
“You can break one chopstick, but you can’t break multiple chopsticks,” says Tran, referring to a Chinese proverb that emphasizes strength in numbers.
As the debate surrounding the Data Equity Bill continues, Tran, despite his stance, implores Massachusetts to carefully consider both sides of the argument before deciding where they stand on the issue.
“I hope the younger generation educates themselves on the pros and cons of such a bill, and not just the talking points from either side.”

Something about freshman dorms compounds messiness. Maybe it’s having less space, or multiple roommates, or no parents. Maybe it’s something else.
I remember learning about entropy in my high school chemistry class: Iit’s something about the scientific tendency of a system to move toward chaos. I guess I’ll blame the messiness on that.
Allow me to set the scene: Mmy common room is cluttered with laundry baskets and overfilled trash cans. Long hair congregates in the corners and under the sink. The air smells, at first whiff, like Febreze, and, at second, like ramen and inertia. A little gross, but probably just your average level of entropy.
But entropy has recently been upending my life in more insidious ways. I folded my laundry yesterday, but later, found the basket tipped over, my clothes re-wrinkled and dust-crusted. I searched for the dustpan, which I could’ve sworn was right under my bed. Turns out it was buried deep inside the closet, as if it didn’t want to be found. Entropy is’s turning out to be more powerful than I thought.
Or consider what happened this morning. My roommates and I always close the windows before bed. But today I found them fully open, cold wind stirring up a mini-tornado of sorts of all the remaining dirt the dustpan had missed.
I started wondering if I was hallucinating, so I went to ask my roommate if she had noticed these phenomena — but then realized she was gone for the weekend at a Bible retreat. Even worse, when I went into her room, I found her window open, too, and all her empty Poland Spring bottles blowing about in a five-pointed star-like formation. In a cold sweat, I googled ‘entropy pentagrams’ and found a WikiHow article about performing burnt sacrifices.
Now nearly hysterical, I ironed and neatly folded my roommate’s Class of 2023 Day of Service t-shirt, then burned it in the shower. Bad idea. I had to call Yard Ops to come open my door because it was completely blockaded by an eight-foot-tall stack of Day of Service t-shirts.
Entropy is just mocking me now, and it’s getting kind of terrifying.
Cleaning up is futile. I somehow navigated around the t-shirts and located the mop. It iswas spontaneously vaporized by a pulsating ball of chaotic energy.
I don’t remember much chemistry, but this entropy seems like it must be greater than 1. Or less than 1 — or whatever the value is that means it’s really goddamn powerful. It almost feels karmic. Am I being punished?
Ok. I’ll admit it. I lied on the roommate questionnaire. Maybe I am more of a 7 on the messiness scale. Fine, 8. Entropy, I surrender. You can’t see me because I’m buried under dust and t-shirts, but I’m waving a white flag. What more do you want?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 25, 2019, at 11:39 p.m.
Harvard’s graduate student union passed its strike authorization vote Friday by an overwhelming majority — with more than 90 percent of voters in support — granting its bargaining committee the power to call a strike when it deems necessary.
Cheers erupted around 10:20 p.m. Friday in Emerson 210, where union members spent more than five hours counting the ballots.
Of the 2,682 members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers who cast ballots in the election, 90.4 percent voted in favor of the strike, according to an email sent to union members late Friday evening.
“We hope that this should be a sign to the administration that student workers are really serious and we're committed to fighting together and doing what it takes to win a strong contract,” bargaining committee member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15 said in an interview outside the vote counting room.
Under the rules set out by the United Automobile Workers Constitution, the union needed a two-thirds majority of voting members to authorize a strike.
HGSU, which represents graduate research assistants and student teaching fellows across Harvard, recently entered its second year of negotiations with the Harvard for its first contract. Organizers started bringing ballots cast across the University to Harvard Yard around 5 p.m. Friday, where the union members counted them in a closed room.
While the union’s voting members offered strong support for strike authorization, the union’s bargaining committee reiterated that they see calling a strike as a “last resort.”
“Striking is an absolute last resort and our intention here is to achieve a fair contract,” said bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16. “This 90.4 percent shows that we are willing and able to do so if the administration doesn't come to the table with a fair deal.”
Yumusak declined to comment on when a strike may take place, but said that the union will be holding “town halls” with its members to inform their planning, such as setting a strike deadline.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement Friday evening that administrators believe a strike is “unwarranted.”
“The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith and has offered substantive proposals that address the concerns raised by HGSU-UAW throughout these negotiations,” Swain wrote.
The union and the University, which have thus far reached a consensus on 11 proposals ranging from workplace resources to intellectual property rights, have not been able to reach tentative agreements on economic issues such as student compensation and health benefits. Two days after voting on the strike authorization began Oct. 17, the two sides agreed on two contract provisions, one regarding international student rights, as well as one on workspaces and materials.
The strike authorization vote brought “energy” to negotiators during the session, according to an email from HGSU bargaining committee member Jennifer K. Austiff to members. She characterized the tentatitive agreements as “significant wins.”
University and HGSU negotiators, however, remain at odds over key harassment and discrimination greivane procedures. The union has proposed that members be allowed to pursue third-party arbitration, which Harvard has repeatedly opposed. Sexual misconduct is currently adjudicated through the Office for Dispute Resolution, which investigates formal Title IX complaints.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in an interview Thursday that Harvard respects the union’s right to strike, but reiterated that the University believes it has approached the bargaining process fairly.
“There's a large number of substantive issues on the table and I think that the discussions have been useful,” he said.
Garber said Thursday it would be “premature” to specify the measures the University plans to take in the event of a strike, but noted that Harvard is looking at other universities’ historic responses to strikes.
Associate Provost Doreen Koretz and University Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email to faculty on Oct. 15 that it is “critical” that faculty begin to plan for how they would continue running courses in the event of a strike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s and women’s cross country posted mixed results on Friday in the prestigious Nuttycombe Invitational, a race considered by many to be the most competitive regular season meet in the nation. Running against most of the top teams in the NCAA, including No. 1 Northern Arizona and No. 5 Stanford on the men’s side and No.1 Arkansas and No. 4 Stanford for the women, the men finished 28th out of 32 teams and the women finished 32nd out of 36.
Both Crimson teams also faced off against conference rivals, with the men falling to No. 23 Princeton, who finished 17th, and beating 32nd-place Columbia. On the women’s side, the team came in behind No. 24 Columbia, who also placed 17th.
In the Men’s 8K, Harvard was once again led by senior Kieran Tuntivate, who crossed the line in 24:21, good for 57th place. The defending Ivy League champion, who narrowly missed All-American status in 2018 with a 47th place at NCAAs, led the crowded field at the halfway point before faltering slightly down the stretch. Tuntivate eventually found himself 26 spots behind Princeton senior Conor Lundy, who Tuntivate beat at last year’s HEPs.
Finishing one second behind Tuntivate was first year Colin Baker, who passed dozens of runners in the final half of the race to secure 60th place in his college debut. The South Carolina native and eighth place finisher at last year’s Foot Locker high school National Championships looks to be a vital part of the Crimson’s postseason hopes in 2019.
Rounding out the scoring for Harvard was senior Will Battershill, Harvard’s third runner at HEPs in 2018 (12th overall), who finished 166th in his season debut, and freshman Acer Iverson and junior Matthew Pereira, who finished 191st and 200th, respectively. In a concerning development, junior Hugo Milner, the junior out of Derby, England who finished 65th at the NCAA Championships last year, dropped out of the race after 4000 meters.
Overall, the meet, which provided an opportunity for the Crimson to make a statement on the National scale, ended in disappointing fashion, but according to captain Charlie Davis, the team’s goals have not changed.
“We are definitely capable of more as a team than what the Wisconsin results show,” said Davis. “Heps, regionals, and nationals have been our main focus the entire season, so I’m excited for us to get on the line and execute the races we’re all capable of.”
The Crimson hope to get the entire team healthy and ready to run in two weeks as they look to knock off Princeton to win the Ivy League and make a run at qualifying for NCAAs for the first time since 2013.
On the women’s side, Harvard ran an incomplete squad but still turned in stellar performances, showcasing a depth that should help them come November.
“The race went well,” said co-captain Gillian Meeks. “We had good races from a lot of the team who did race, which puts us in a good place when we add back in key scoring members.”
Without senior Lisa Tertsch, junior Abbe Goldstein, and junior Anna Juul, Harvard’s first, second and fifth finishers at 2018 HEPs, the team saw strong performances from its younger runners. Freshman Iz Sagar continued her outstanding rookie year, again pacing the Crimson with a 21:08 6K that put her in 75th place. Sophomore Maya Rayle and Freshman Shaked Leibovitz also scored, placing fourth and fifth on the team and 183rd and 242nd overall.
“It’s great to have our younger members doing so well,” remarked Meeks. “It can be really difficult, especially for freshmen, to adjust to the higher level of competition and just the bigger races in general. I’ve been really happy to see some of the younger members really stepping up and having some gritty performances.”
Veteran contributors junior Brooke Starn and Meeks also turned in solid races, finishing second and third on the team, separated by just three seconds and six spots at 121st and 127th. The team now turns their focus to continuing to train and let injuries heal before the postseason.
Noting that the Crimson women have not run their full championship squad all year, Meeks expressed confidence.
“I think we’re going to surprise people and are capable of a great team performance,” said Meeks.
Harvard’s next race is the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships on November 1st at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, N.Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the summer before her junior year of high school, Kirby Porter ’18 came to a stark realization: There is more to life than basketball.
Sidelined by a torn ACL, Porter, then a standout player at the Bullis School in Potomac, Md., found herself having to think beyond the game for the first time in her life.
“Each athlete comes to that moment at a different time,” Porter says. “For me, it was a torn ACL heading into what was the biggest season. That moment enabled me to think a little bit differently about my career.”
That summer, Porter interned at the NFL Players Association, which “provided the grounding” for her current passions beyond the game. But her playing days were far from over: The six-foot-one-inch guard went on to play four years of varsity basketball at Harvard before graduating with a degree in sociology last spring. During her time at Harvard, Porter interned with the New England Patriots, Under Armor and PepsiCo, where she works today.
Throughout her time at those companies, Porter says she developed a passion “for fan-building, for storytelling [and] for impacting people and athletes through the outfit of my work.”
“That was the foundation that I first found way back when I was in high school, when I had the game taken away for a second,” Porter said. “And I think that was reconfirmed each step of the way throughout my four years at Harvard — on the court, off the court and through the work experiences that I had.”
Those passions inspired Porter to create Court to Corporate — a digital platform that aims to “amplify the journey of athletes in corporate America to provide the mentorship, tools, and connectivity for the next generation to succeed,” according to the organization’s website.
Porter says she was frustrated by the “negative portrayal” of what athletes do outside of their playing career. She says that watching “Broke,” an episode of the ESPN documentary series “30 for 30” that explores how and why many athletes go bankrupt after retirement, was an eye-opening example to her of how athletes’ post-playing career endeavors are portrayed in a negative light. (The trailer for “Broke” opens with a jarring 2009 estimate by Sports Illustrated: After two years of retirement, 78 percent of ex-NFL players “have gone bankrupt or are under financial stress because of joblessness or divorce.”)
But according to Porter, that narrative is changing today, thanks in large part to Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, who created the platform Uninterrupted, which aims to empower athletes through storytelling. Last fall, James traveled the globe as part of the “More than an Athlete World Tour.”
“I think a lot of the narratives that you saw with athletes beyond the game were previously in a negative light, and [Uninterrupted is] shifting that,” Porter said.
But James’ work revolves mostly around professional athletes. Enter: Court to Corporate.
“As I was looking at these narratives evolving, I thought, ‘why is there not a space to go to where this narrative is applied to the 98 percent of athletes who don’t go on to play professionally?’” Porter said. “With that, Court to Corporate was really about amplifying this journey of athletes who go through the same exact process: leveraging their skillsets, their intangibles, their personal brand, their power and their identity to excel beyond the game, but just through a different lense — through their careers. And when they leverage it the right way, it empowers them and can accelerate their journey beyond the game. There hadn’t really been visibility to that.”
Porter launched Court to Corporate as an Instagram page on January 6. In March, she put out the first episode of her Podcast, “Court to Corporate: The Athlete’s Playbook in the Business World,” which is now available on most major podcasting platforms. The show features discussions with current and former college athletes, many of whom are now businesspeople, as well as inspirational speakers, coaches and entrepreneurs.
For some student athletes, who dedicate much of their time in college to a sport, the transition to life beyond athletics can be turbulent. Court to Corporate exists to provide those athletes a blueprint for success.
“What’s really hard as varsity athletes is we dedicate so much time to our sport in the summers, in the offseasons and we’re not able necessarily to take advantage of work opportunities,” said former Harvard women’s ice hockey player Chelsea Ziadie ’18. “Once we graduate, it’s kind of like, ‘OK, I dedicated all of these hours and all of my time — 18 years of life — to this sport, but now how do I transfer those skills? Or am I too late? Did everyone already get that job that I wanted because I was at practice?’
“I think hearing about how other people become successful in that is really important and that’s what [Porter is] allowing people to do.”
Ziadie, who was interviewed on Porter’s podcast in April, now plays in the Professional Women’s Ice Hockey Association, in addition to working full-time at Morgan Stanley. Ziadie says she wakes up at 4:40 a.m. every morning in order to make it to the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., for practice. She then commutes to New York City to start work at 9 a.m.
Ziadie, who was named the women’s ice hockey team’s Most Valuable Player in 2018, is full of praise for Porter’s initiative.
“We prioritize the things that are important to us, and she’s making this the priority in her life, and I think that speaks to how passionate she is about it,” Ziadie said. “She doesn’t have to do this — she has a job. She’s already on her path and her career. The whole goal of this is to give back to others and help others understand what maybe we didn’t understand when we were younger, or what we wish we knew.
“She’s very charismatic, she’s very intelligent and I think that what she’s doing is wonderful. When someone doesn’t have to do something but they’re going out of their way and making time to prioritize that in their life, I think that speaks volumes as to who they are as a person.”
For Harvard sophomore Sofie Fella, who plays varsity rugby, the Court to Corporate podcast has been “super helpful” in discovering non-athletic passions.
“I know that when I’m done with college, if I’m not able to play rugby anymore, that’s not the end of the world,” said Fella, who interns with the Harvard Athletics Marketing team. “I have something else that I can wake up and be excited for every day. That’s a message that’s really important to educate a lot of athletes on that could prevent people investing their entire lives into a sport and then not knowing what to do after college.”
Porter has plans to expand Court to Corporate. She says that “a big priority No. 1 of Court” is to “meet the athletes where they are right now and bring this conversation offline.”
“Ultimately, we want to bring this to people in-person,” Porter said. “I think building that connection on the ground is so important and is the natural evolution for Court to Corporate.”
Regardless of what’s next, Porter’s message remains the same.
“I think athletes are sometimes left out of the conversation, and I think there needs to be a space for athletes to be able to learn from those who come before them in the corporate world,” she said. “That’s really been the inspiration behind Court to Corporate — to amplify this journey of athletes in corporate America, provide the platform for current and former athletes to share how they’re leveraging their playbook beyond the game. It’s to reinstill that sense of community.”
