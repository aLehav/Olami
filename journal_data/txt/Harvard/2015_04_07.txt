After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A once-intimate relationship unravels; at the same time, two young people discover love. In any show this contrast in the two love stories would be striking. In the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Last Five Years,” it carried an even heavier weight, as the two couples were one and the same. Depicting the events that lead to a failed marriage between the play’s only two characters, writer Jamie (Joe Viola ’17, Boston Conservatory) and actress Cathy (Julia I. Biedry ’17), the musical presented two narratives side-by-side: One starts as their romance blossoms while the other begins at the very end of their relationship. Although this distinct form of storytelling might normally present difficulties for the cast and crew, “The Last Five Years,” which ran April 2-5 at the Adams Pool Theater, ultimately transcended any of the potential challenges of its script to create a production of masterful acting, staging, and music that reflected the trials of a disconnected love.
The musical’s narrative style—in which the characters rarely interact with each other and instead sing alternating soliloquies—demanded a high degree of deftness and precision from the actors. They met the challenge with gusto. Biedry and Viola gave strong performances that brimmed with emotion. This effect was emphasized by the production’s heavy focus on the minute details in the actors’ expressions and actions. During the opening song, “Still Hurting,” Biedry emoted her character’s pain at her marriage’s failure through teary eyes and expressive eyebrows that raised at key moments of frustration in the song. The impact of Biedry’s performance was further enhanced by Eva S. Monroe ’18’s phenomenal lighting design; the stage was shrouded in darkness, except for a sole spotlight on Biedry that highlighted even the most minute changes in her visage. For his part, Viola matched Biedry in demonstrative skill. When he entered on stage at the beginning of “A Miracle Would Happen/When You Come Home to Me,” his aggravated look and a tap of his wedding ring finger on a beer bottle indicated his frustration at being unable to pursue women after marriage, even before he sang. Such powerful acting allowed the performers to bring their characters and the turbulent emotions in their relationship to life, despite being unable to interact with each other.
The force of Viola and Biedry’s performances was strengthened by their powerful singing. The two hit their high pitches almost perfectly and drew out their notes with ease and intensity. Their vitality was matched by the orchestra that accompanied them—reflecting the sentiments on stage, they duplicated the actors’ sudden crescendos and changes in tone perfectly. Most notable was the production’s music director, Melanie J. Rucinski ’15, on the piano. During Biedry’s part in “A Miracle Would Happen/When You Come Home to Me,” Rucinski’s playing complemented Biedry’s character’s shifting emotions. As Biedry sang her character’s thoughts about the audition, the piano produced a harsh, terser sound; the music grew slower and lighter as she made the instantaneous shift to singing her audition piece, a love song.
The overall accomplished execution created a production that poignantly dramatized the motifs of detachment and disunion—a theme already implied by the narrative structure but effectively reinforced by the production’s staging by director Steve Kunis ’17. The set, designed by Aidan C. Campbell ’17, was simple: a bed, located center stage, framed by a wood-paneled room and a white-walled space. This layout created a spatial divide between the actors; Biedry and Viola performed on their respective sides, making the detachment between the two more evident. When the actors were in a scene together, such as in “The Schmuel Song” and “If I Didn’t Believe in You,” the non-speaking actor—Biedry in both of these instances—had her back turned to the audience. This blocking decision hid Biedry’s expressions, producing a sense of distance from her and her character. As Jamie’s timeline moved towards his marriage’s demise in “If I Didn’t Believe in You,” Viola, too, sang to Biedry’s back, suggesting his isolation was the same as the audience’s. Contrasted with their open postures during “The Schmuel Song,” which occurred during a moment when their love was blossoming, this blocking choice made the growing fracture in the couple’s relationship more evident. In this way, the production projected the growing disconnection that the characters felt within their relationships beyond the actors’ performances and into the staging itself.
Ultimately, HRDC’s production was a testament to the power of expressive actors, an adroit orchestra, and thoughtful staging. Through these combined forces, the performance skillfully studied the complexities of love and probed into the lack of understanding that can result in the destruction of a once-thriving relationship. The result was a show that surpassed its potentially difficult source material to create a product both evocative and reflective.

Brief introductory music booms with a steady drumbeat and a wild, jungle-esque quality as a deep voice crashes through the theater: “Thus begins the story…wrought with danger, adventure, and a clash of mortal enemies—but above all the story of relationships that transcend all barriers.” Shortly after, a trumpet sounds unexpectedly offstage, echoing the wild sounds of the forest. Adorned with ivy climbing across the walls and dim lighting in earthy hues, the theater transports its audience to another world. From the set design and music to the dancing, Harvard Ballet Company’s “The Jungle Book”—which opened in the Loeb Ex on April 3 and runs through April 11—is executed exceptionally well.
Based on Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book,” the performance tells a story of adventure and relationships that overcome barriers. It chronicles the life of Mowgli (Angelina R. Massa ’18), a human being raised by wolves in the jungle. With the help of Bagheera (Ellie Y. Underwood ’18) and Baloo (Juan J. Aparicio ’15), Mowgli interacts with a variety of animals as he grows up. He learns to adapt to life in the jungle, evident in his successful fight against the tiger Shere Khan (Gabriella D. Czarniak ’17).
The dancing is incredibly precise and technically consistent, even on the level of a professional production. Some of the dances are performed on pointe and others are not, allowing dancers to display a wide array of techniques. The choreography, which was created by several company members and guest choreographer Karen Gayle, challenges the dancers not only to mimic actions of animals through their mesmerizing dancing but also to tell a captivating and plot-driven story—a challenge they meet.
Despite the technical proficiency of the dancing, the show truly becomes a wild success due to the innovative directorial decisions of Lilly C. Riverón ’17 and Catherine J. Qin ’17. The production uses the Ex to its fullest extent: For example, at one point dancers playing the roles of monkeys climb around the ledges of the second-tiered balcony. The set design is fairly simple, though it teems with intricate details that give it the wildness of a jungle. The consistency of the background, which does not change throughout the show, yields attention to the contrasts occurring in front of it as the story’s characters and plot developed. Additionally, the performance merges live, student-created music with pre-recorded music, both of which add authenticity. The live music lends an additional layer to the depth of the jungle theme; though the sounds are at times unique and unexpected, the music combines technical accomplishment with thematic interpretation. Additionally, narrative interludes cut through the silence between music to add words to the story being told through dance. This allows for audience members to connect more concretely to the plot of the story.
All in all, Harvard Ballet Company’s “The Jungle Book” is a compelling exploration of a traditional story innovatively interpreted. From its technical precision and immersive setting to its engaging choreography and music, the production is a strong contribution to ballet on the Harvard campus.

Near the beginning of “Furious 7,” Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel, gives a little drag racing advice. Do not push the engine into the red, Toretto warns, or it will blow, losing the race. “Furious 7,” the latest installment in Universal’s “The Fast and the Furious” film series, takes its own advice—but only barely, escalating the action just short of absurdity. As it is, the film is a thrilling piece of work, but a few more punches, crashes, and engine revs, and “Furious 7” would have blown out its engine and come to a sputtering, undignified halt.
The film opens on a close-up of Deckard Shaw, played by Jason Statham, with his face turned away from the camera. In a calm, measured voice, Shaw reminisces about his brother’s childhood habit of starting fights before vowing to finish his now-deceased brother’s vendetta against Toretto and his associates. Then, just before Shaw’s surprisingly poignant monologue might have prompted the viewer to think about the obligations of brotherhood or the nature of vendetta, the camera pans out to show that this and the surrounding rooms are completely carpeted with bodies—Shaw has apparently just defeated a small army. This is the film’s way of warning its audience that realism and meaning will be taking a backseat.
From this start, “Furious 7” goes as fast as it possibly can, with little regard for details like plot or characterization. How does Deckard Shaw so reliably cause so much trouble? Who cares? To evaluate the plot is to miss the point. The car chases and fight scenes are not a part of the plot; the plot is a vehicle for delivering those chases and fights. The same goes for characterization. Though there are convincing character arcs—the send-off for Paul Walker’s character Brian was very well handled, especially in view of the actor’s death during production—and bad ones—amnesia has not been an interesting cinematic device since Hitchcock—the purpose of character development in this film is primarily to give the audience a chance to catch its breath before “Furious 7” floors the accelerator again. The movie delivers on its promise to excite. This is a film in which cars battle helicopters and Predator drones, drop out of midair planes, and jump from skyscraper to skyscraper. No one with eyes and adrenaline glands could watch “Furious 7” and walk away unimpressed.
Yet director James Wan stops just short of the point at which unbelievability might keep the audience from caring. He handles hand-to-hand combat particularly well. Though the characters throw and take a few too many punches for any human, the sickening crunches when hits land, the brief pauses for breath mid-fight, and the disorienting rotation of the camera that accompanies a character being picked up and slammed into the ground all work together to maintain engagement and conviction that viewers are watching people and not cartoon characters.
In all but medium, however, “Furious 7” is essentially a cartoon. Walker’s Brian struggles with the decision to retire from his fast-paced life; in the context of the movie that decision makes a lot of sense. The world of “The Fast and the Furious” is a fantasy of the highest order, filled with fast cars, underdressed beautiful women, and life-threatening excitement that is not actually threatening—so why leave? Only when the film has come to an end can the audience return to reality.
“Furious 7” will probably be very financially successful, and the film deserves it. It set out to deliver a thrilling spectacle, and it undoubtedly succeeded. “Furious 7” delivers as much excitement as the franchise can reach without becoming ridiculous. Thanks to the allure of a valuable brand, Universal Pictures may be planning an eighth movie—in interviews, Vin Diesel and producer Neal Moritz have already hinted at the possibility.The rules of escalation will demand still more excitement from the sequel: If cars fell from the sky in “7,” they will fly in “8.” At that point, the paper-thin illusion of realism might tear. Regrettably, “Furious 7” will probably not be the franchise’s final movie. It may, however, be its best.

“It can’t be ruled out that for László, imagination was stronger than reality,” muses the narrator of “Between Generals,” the fifth in a collection of short stories by the late Italian author Antonio Tabucchi. This statement does double duty to affirm the power of “imagination.” Both the narrator and the protagonist are absorbed by possibilities—how a story might end, how one would explain themselves to a friend, where a lost romance would have led. This keen interest in one’s mental world of theories and memories is threaded throughout the collection, titled “Time Ages in a Hurry.” The book is hugely diverse in its range of characters, settings, plots, and storytelling techniques, yet its nine stories are linked not only by their underlying concern with the passage of time but also by Tabucchi’s incredible ability to represent consciousness and his care for the everyday.
In almost every superficial aspect, the stories in “Time Ages in a Hurry” are widely varied. They are peopled by Italians, Hungarians, Romanians; they are located in Berlin, Tel Aviv, Crete. Even more colorfully, the stories are told in many different ways. The plot of “Clouds” is entirely driven by the dialogue between a young girl and a middle-aged man who strike up a conversation while sitting on the beach. “The Dead at the Table” follows a man walking the streets of Berlin alone deep in thought. “Between Generals” and “Against Time” call attention to the process of storytelling itself and nearly span whole lifetimes as they do so. In their distinctness, each of Tabucchi’s pieces feels like a treasure, a small gift or sweet to be unwrapped gleefully.
But the particular selection of works is far from random. The most obvious unifying feature of the stories is thematic: Each, in its own way, explores the nature of time and memory. While the protagonists come from a wide range of professions—from writer to soldier—a majority of these men (and occasional women) are retired from their former careers. The plots, then, while focused very concretely on the present moment, depict the experience of looking back on actions and events that were carried out or took place in the past. The collection, then, may be a wide-ranging exploration, but it is nonetheless acutely driven.
Tabucchi’s time metaphors alone are arguably worth the price of admission. The main character in “The Circle,” for example, compares herself to a child holding a balloon that is suddenly punctured. The balloon seems to have been stolen, “but no, the balloon was still there, only the air had been stolen. So that’s how it was, time was air and she’d let it exhale from a tiny hole of which she was unaware?” In “Bucharest Hasn’t Changed a Bit,” a man who appears to be manifesting symptoms of dementia tries to justify to his son his refusal to take the pills he’s been prescribed. Memory, he explains, “takes the shape it wants to according to the moment.” It can’t be represented as the doctors would like: “They want to make it trigonometrical, that’s the right word, so it’s easily measured, like dice, this is reassuring for them, a die has six sides, you turn it over and can see them all, does memory seem like a die to you?”
Tabucchi doesn’t merely sum up time and memory in words—he also demonstrates their protean nature in his representations of consciousness. The action in these stories takes place largely in the mental worlds of the characters, but the tales are by no means claustrophobic. Some of Tabucchi’s most vivid scenic imagery comes from imaginary landscapes that enter a character’s mind, as when the protagonist of “Drip, Drop, Drippity-Drop” likens a dripping sound in his head to rain falling on a lakeshore. Likewise, the most meaningful conversations in the book are often those a character only imagines he might have with an unspecific figure from his life, revealing “internal monologue” to be in fact internal dialogue. Later in “Drip, Drop, Drippity-Drop,” for example, the same man considers calling a woman, possibly his half-sister, “and then he’d say: I know very well you can’t wake up someone at this hour after not calling him for three years.” Several of the short stories in “Time Ages in a Hurry” revolve around just this sort of hypothetical interaction in a nominally vague but emotionally specific relationship.
In this honest and gentle depiction of an individual’s private perception of reality exists a clear appreciation for the minute, even the mundane, which is transformed by Tabucchi’s linguistic caress into something dewy and new. In particular, his work is unafraid to engage with the contemporary. He is democratic in his description, lending fresh language to a set of car keys, a branded café napkin, the magazine in an airplane seat pocket. This was an author who understood that a great part of life is spent not doing but envisioning what one could do and remembering what one has done. “Time Ages in a Hurry” is a collection that showcases not only Tabucchi’s intelligence but also his wisdom.

Although Harvard is the alma mater of renowned directors ranging from Terrence F. Malick ’65 to Damien S. Chazelle ’07, it did not have an official student film festival until last year, when the Harvard College Film Festival was founded. In April 2014, the student-run organization first screened student films submitted from around the country, organized lectures by panelists, and gave nine awards (including Best Directing and Best Cinematography) to films across four categories of submissions (Experimental, Documentary/Social Change, Fiction and Super Shorts). This year, the second Harvard College Film Festival, which will run from April 13 to 18, hopes to expand its scale and influence.
Whereas the first Harvard College Film Festival ran for only one day, this year it will last for four days and include more speeches and social events, in addition to more screenings. According to Panchi Simeto ’17, one of the festival's directors, this year’s theme will be “Young Visionaries: The Different Faces of Film,” which seeks to explore the ways young filmmakers have a sweeping, creative impact. The festival plans to achieve this by focusing on three different categories in its program: the artistic, the political, and the comedic. To highlight the first two elements, the festival will not only present the student films in the competition but also host a special screening of “American Promise,” winner of Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2013. To emphasize its comedy component, the organizers will also collaborate with The Immediate Gratification Players, On Harvard Time, and the Harvard College Stand-Up Comics Society for an event on Friday. “Our main focus this year is how can we grow it [and] how can we just make it more known,” says Hannah A. Nunez ’15, co-director of the film festival.
This year’s longer festival is also expanded through its larger number of more diverse submissions. Boosted by the experience and connections from the first film festival, the organization reached out to many other Ivy League schools and colleges with eminent film departments and received very positive feedback. “We have a very good PR team this year…. [Compared to] our submissions from last year, [submissions this year] almost doubled,” Simeto says. These films will be reviewed by a panel of judges that consists of professional filmmakers and professors from universities, including Harvard and Emerson, and the selected films will be shown at the student screenings portion of the film festival.
The organization’s short history presents many challenges, especially in terms of money. “Being a new organization and having little information...from last year in terms of being able to get funding is the biggest challenge for this year’s fundraising team,” Simeto says. “Luckily…the UC and the Office for the Arts have been very generous, and the event finally worked out well.”
Regardless of such challenges, Simeto hopes the film festival will connect film lovers at Harvard and help them explore the industry. “My whole goal with the film festival has been to bridge a community of young filmmakers at Harvard that seems at times a bit refracted,” she says. “There are a lot of different organizations that are smaller...but beyond that, there’s not a unifying group on campus that can combine a lot of people’s interest in film.”
Simeto further believes that it is important for young filmmakers to meet new people who share similar interests, so, apart from film screenings, the film festival also organizes social events and workshops that are open both to those eager to enter the industry and those who simply enjoy watching films. Another goal of the festival is to expose young filmmakers at Harvard to the works of their peers at other universities, from Yale to NYU to USC. “We want to see what [other] people are doing, what people are excited about, and kind of open up the community to not only Harvard students but beyond,” Simeto says.
Ultimately, it is this desire to connect the film community that drives the mission of the film festival. “[We want it] to be something that the film community could be excited about and what Harvard can be excited about,” Nunez says.

As a Harvard sophomore, Sam Wu has already made contributions worldwide to music, composition, and conducting. He has arranged pieces for the Melbourne, China National, and Shanghai Symphony Orchestras, among others: at Harvard, he is assistant conductor of the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra and assistant music director of the Mozart Society Orchestra. In November, Wu premiered the “TEA” suite with the River Charles Ensemble, featuring pianist Cherie Z. Hu ’17.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get started with music and composing?
Sam Wu: My first real connection with music was when I was seven—I played violin, and soon after I also started piano. But it was more something I did outside of schoolwork.… Middle school…was the turning point because it was the first time I joined an orchestra, and the teamwork aspect of playing with an orchestra and how together you can have so much more fun with music…was so magical for me. A few years later I also started writing music. I saw my music teacher back in middle school using a typesetting program called Sibelius to do arrangements.… I thought it was so magical; it was like a video game to me.… Throughout I became more interested in composing and conducting than [playing] the violin, and at some point I just didn’t have time [for both].
THC: How do you balance music with other commitments at Harvard?
SW: I’m a Music and East Asian Studies joint concentrator. All my extra-curricular commitments are always related to my music and my aspirations to be a professional musician, so in that regard, it’s quite hard to prioritize because everything’s equally important. I actually do have an issue with overcommitment. It’s a learning process for me too, to gauge how much I can really do.
THC: What was it like composing “TEA” for the River Charles Ensemble last November?
SW: It was wonderful. We [had] talked about a piece since last January, so I had a lot of months to have it inside me before I could put it out. I think that piece…really encapsulates my interest in humanities as well as music and also is a musical projection of what I’m interested in academically—of tea being a microcosm of a larger picture of the Silk Road or how ideas, religions, and philosophies travel throughout the Asian mainland.
THC: Who is your greatest inspiration—either in music or in general?
SW: One of my greatest inspirations would be my music mentor, Tan Dun—he composed for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” He’s someone whom I’ve known since my junior year of high school, and we have this wonderful mentorship relationship where I feel very comfortable [seeking] advice from him and engag[ing] in frank and illuminating conversation about anything from conducting to composing.
THC: What are your plans for the future?
SW: I hope to go to grad school for music. In the immediate future, this summer…I will do some research in Hong Kong about the Southern Chinese ritual opera tradition, which I’m really interested in because that’s near where I’m ethnically from. It’s also potentially a project I could really be inspired from to write a senior thesis or some sort of theater ritual opera piece. On April 10 I’m going to Yale to give a premiere of another very interesting collaboration I’ve never done before, which is a piano solo and paint[ing]—like performance art [with] the music…in dialogue with the painting.
THC: What is your greatest piece of advice for aspiring musicians and composers?
SW: Make friends, because friends are…a great source of inspiration—your greatest sounding board. As musicians you can face the challenge [of] being stuck for so many hours in the practice room, or you’re stuck in your own room writing. You can feel somewhat isolated, and I feel like that’s the opposite of how I want to feel. I think it’s being connected with the world around you that allows you to really create work that’s meaningful.

Spring has finally arrived at the Museum of Fine Arts. To celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the museum’s Department of Asian Art, the MFA has planned a tribute to Japanese culture with an extensive, season-long event referred to as “Japanese Spring.” On April 5, two exhibits will open to kick off the program: one an ambitious retrospective of the iconic nineteenth-century Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai, the other, titled “In the Wake,” a highly selective exploration of artistic responses to the three-part Japanese disaster of 3/11.
The MFA has been committed to perpetuating a dialogue surrounding the interaction between Asian and American culture since 1890, when it became the first museum in America to establish a department dedicated solely to the preservation and study of Japanese art.“We really love the fact that our museum is so critical a voice in Japan-U.S. art dialogue,” says Anne Nishimura Morse, the museum’s senior curator of Japanese art. One way that the MFA will moderate this conversation in the coming months is by presenting their collection of works by Hokusai, which is largely unmatched in its variety of media, scope of his career, and largesse.
Because of this, the museum did not seek to procure works from other institutions for the showcase. “The point of this exhibit is very much to brag about what the MFA owns,” says Sarah Thompson, the curator of the exhibition. “We are enormously proud of the fact that we are the only museum in the world that could do a Hokusai retrospective of this scope entirely based on our own collection. So we deliberately did not ask for loans.”
The “Hokusai” exhibition features over 230 pieces by the artist and explores seven major themes that imbue his oeuvre—delineated by Thompson herself—in a range of media from paintings to paper lanterns to his most famous woodblock prints, the latter of which were the focus of the tour given by Thompson to the press. The exhibit features Hokusai’s best-known print series, titled “Thirty-Six Views of Mt. Fuji,” along with other renowned works. These include: “Phoenix,” an ink drawing that spans an eight-paneled folding screen; his so-called “Large Flowers” series; and a delicate, decorated fabric that would have served the same purpose as gift-wrap, featuring Hokusai’s imagined rendition of a lion.
According to Thompson, this rendering of a lion is interesting not only because of its unique medium but also because it evidences Hokusai’s creativity. “Since there weren’t any lions in Japan, he just made up what it might look like,” she says. In this vein, Thompson created a separate theme in the exhibition whose function is to pay homage to Hokusai’s creativity as well as showcase the diversity and depth of the museum’s collection. “There is one section that I called ‘Ingenious Designs,’ and that is precisely the oddball things,” she says. “It’s a very assorted group of things, and yet all of them show Hokusai being very clever and not just as a visual artist working in two dimensions.”
Meanwhile, an exhibition that explores a vastly different aspect of Japanese culture is opening in a nearby wing of the museum: “In the Wake” is as different in structure and size from “Hokusai” as it is in subject matter. The exhibition, which culls 100 digital reactions to the “Triple Disaster” of 3/11—the earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent nuclear disaster at Fukushima on March 11, 2011—features the works of 17 artists, most of whom hail from Japan. According to Morse, who co-curated “In the Wake” with Anne Havinga, senior curator of photographs, and Japanese art research fellow Tomoko Nagakura, the exhibit aims to enrich the global understanding of Japanese art by presenting varied responses to its culture.
By simultaneously opening “Hokusai” and “In the Wake,” the MFA will provide visitors with a more holistic impression of the country than they would from a single exhibit. “Our department has always been really committed to telling the whole story of Japanese art,” Morse says. “Hokusai is probably one of the most well-known figures in Japanese art, but we also want to show that our museum is not just stuck in one period…. That is one of the reasons we’re doing ‘In the Wake.’”
Through its “Japanese Spring” program, the MFA attempts to create a sampling of Japanese culture that represents diverse histories and experiences. “You can go to collections and have the great art, but if it doesn’t have a community that’s built around it or raises certain issue or gets people to look closer [at art], like an artist like Hokusai, then it’s—to me—not as much fun,” Morse says.

The enigma of Don Draper has attracted countless paragraphs of prevaricating think pieces and hours of discussion, little of which has done more than simply pose the question, “How can someone so manifestly flawed manage still to be so engaging, so likeable?” Though Jon Hamm’s work on “Mad Men” is certainly exceptional, to focus so single-mindedly on Don’s character is not only to miss a great deal of what is appealing about the show but also to ignore what ultimately makes him deserving of sympathy.
By far the most compelling episode of the first half of season seven, “The Strategy,” revealed more of Don’s psychology to the viewer than had ever been evident previously—and it did so via his relationship with Elisabeth Moss’s Peggy, a connection that has always, ultimately, constituted the show’s emotional core. Certainly, the pair have had their ups and downs, most recently through the tension caused by Don’s return to Sterling Cooper & Partners as Peggy’s underling. But it is Peggy, working late into the night with Don in a callback to the similarly outstanding season seven episode “The Suitcase,” who gets Don to admit the fears he harbors: “That I never did anything, and that I don’t have anyone.”
Don is flawed and scared, and so is Peggy, but somehow, in these occasional moments when the viewer sees them alone, they are able to keep each other afloat. When Don dances with Peggy to “My Way” a few moments later, in one of the most lasting images of the season thus far, it is not quite paternal, nor is it quite romantic. There is simply some indescribable quality about Don and Peggy’s relationship that makes it somehow crucial, somehow perfect, despite each character’s manifest imperfections. And it is moreover perhaps this aspect of “Mad Men” that gives it so much stronger a sense of truth and reality than perhaps any other show has ever been able to achieve.
Show creator Matthew Weiner understands how two human beings may come together to create something greater than themselves and how it is that something that grants them their humanity. Don is a character who can keep afloat a 7-season television show not because of any quality of his own but because of how he does, ultimately, care—for his children, for Megan, and, above all, for Peggy. When Don accepts the apparent end of his time at SC&P and has Peggy present to Burger Chef in his place so that at least she may advance her career, and when the two embrace in season seven episode seven when both Don’s position at the firm and the account are assured, they are both the best versions of themselves. “I worry about a lot of things, but I don’t worry about you,” Don tells Peggy in “The Strategy.” And why should he, when his regard for Peggy is the best part of himself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald Draper is a man among men. Underneath his suave exterior is a truly complex character who never fails to surprise. What makes Don such an alluring and mysterious figure, as well as one of the most compelling leads in television today, is his volatile unpredictability. Many admire him for his handsome looks, fine taste in alcohol, and sharp wardrobe. Yet it is the moments that complicate his persona that make him more than another Don Juan. His acts of disruption, ever reflecting the tumult of 1960s America, have kept “Mad Men” compelling for seven smoke-infested seasons.
Cynical Don
“What you call love was invented by guys like me...to sell nylons.”—Don
The show’s pilot introduces Don as a rising hot shot in one of Madison Avenue’s finest ad agencies. Like any other ad man, he has a knack for conceiving catchy phrases to associate good feelings with commercial products. One would like to think that these concepts come from a good place, but it is apparent that Don does not truly believe in his own ideas. He speaks of the very societal conventions he is paid to promote with disdain. Don’s integrity is compromised by his own incessant cynicism. All the while, he confidently blends into and inhabits the very society he mocks. Don’s cynicism provides many reasons to hate him, and yet it becomes the very reason why he is so fascinating; contention is just more interesting to watch.
Genius Don
“Nostalgia—it's delicate, but potent...It's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards... it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called the wheel, it's called the carousel. It let's us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.”—Don
In one of the greatest moments in “Mad Men,” Don delivers a pitch about a [Kodak wheel-shaped projector. He coins it “the Carousel” and delivers a heartfelt speech about nostalgia over pictures of his wife and children. The pitch room is Don’s zone, and he inhabits it with confidence. In light of the introduction to Cynical Don, one wonders as to whether or not he actually believes his own touching words. Don’s genius is not just in his poetic finesse in selling a product but also his ability to sell himself as a loving, family man—in fact, his entire adult life has basically been a lie. Appropriately, the entire room buys into him as they have already done with the product. His coworker leaves in tears because of the “genuine,” raw emotion emanating in the air. The irony underlying this scene is the contrast between the sentimentality of the photos and the possibility that Don is completely faking it. This disconnect is addressed many seasons later during the infamous “Hershey’s Pitch,” where, in a moment of weakness, he confesses to the clients that his entire pitch was a chocolatey, sugar-coated lie and instead reveals his true sob story. Unfortunately for Don, he should have remembered that the advertisement industry thrives on happiness, not sadness.
Angry Don
“You embezzled funds and you forged my signature…I’m going to need your resignation.”—Don
Firm, staunch, and blunt, Angry Don does not have time for bull. Nobody screws with Angry Don.
Drunk + Flirty + Platonic + Chivalrous Don
“Congratulations for getting divorced.”—Don
“I like being bad and going home and being good.”—Don
Don knows how to have fun, too. However, this side of him only appears after a couple of drinks. Alcohol, it seems, is the only remedy for his cynicism…but what a remedy it can be! In this bonding moment between Don and one out of two of his only platonic female friends, he confides in and consoles Joan after her divorce. In this state, Don’s charm and wit are on full throttle. Talking sweetly over Doris Day’s “The Christmas Waltz” in the background, Don redefines sexy.
Sensitive Don
“I worry about a lot of things, but I don’t worry about you.”—Don
“What do you have to worry about?”—Peggy
“That I never did anything, and I don’t have anyone.”—Don
Sensitive Don is a drink away from becoming a Wrecked Don. He does not often become vulnerable for the sake of somebody else. As Peggy (his other platonic female friend) has emotionally consoled him before, Don opens himself up and offers to have a serendipitous dance with Peggy to Frank Sinatra’s “My Way." The dance recognizes her astounding progress in the workplace as a woman and allows them to show each other a mutual respect long in the making. It is a beautiful moment between two colleagues-turned-friends that builds on their 7-season history together. They have truly done it their way.

We write on behalf of Harvard College Act on a Dream, an organization created in 2008 with the sole mission of passing the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, a piece of legislation that would provide a pathway to citizenship to qualifying youth. Since then, we have educated our peers on the complexity of our broken immigration system, we have written to our members of Congress, and we have lobbied for immigration reform in Washington, D.C. However, we find that there remains a crucial piece missing in our fight for immigration reform—the DREAMers of Harvard University are not receiving sufficient support from the university itself. Prior to the announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, undocumented Harvard graduates returned home with their degrees only to be employed by the underground economy. Few found no other option but to move to their native countries, places they had only seen as children.
Before DACA, DREAMers were continually excluded from Harvard experiences such as studying abroad or completing a fellowship. With the announcement of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, qualifying DREAMers can now live without fear of deportation for a period of two years and have the opportunity to seek temporary employment. Nonetheless, DACA does not provide a pathway to citizenship and thus leaves them and their communities at the mercy of politics. Furthermore, while DACA protects DREAMers from deportation, it does not protect their parents.
With the announcement of Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, some protection can now be extended to our communities. However, this protection is currently imperiled by one of the most conservative courts in our nation. On February 17., a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against Obama’s executive action.
This gives Harvard the opportunity to lead.
If President Drew Faust publically addresses the issue of DAPA and announces Harvard University’s support of such a policy, the immigration dialogue could shift. We do not claim that Harvard University alone can guarantee fair immigration reform. However, as one of the world’s most progressive institutions, it can certainly do its part in guiding America to this goal.
We called on our peers to aid us in our goals, and they quickly demonstrated their support via the UC Referendum in 2013 in which 80% of voting students voted in favor of Harvard University openly supporting comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Comprehensive immigration reform goes even further than DAPA or DACA, fixing our broken system and granting a pathway to citizenship to millions of undocumented individuals.
Now, in this time of pivotal change, President Faust should once again take the lead.  In 2009, she publicly voiced her support for the DREAM Act, shifting the dialogue in favor of DREAMers. She said, “I believe it is in our best interest to educate all students to their full potential—it vastly improves their lives and grows our communities and economy.”  Again, in 2015, President Faust voiced her support for DREAMers by writing to Massachusetts' Congressional delegation, discouraging the defunding of DACA, and succeeding in making sure the program that has benefitted so many of us remains funded.
While we thank President Faust for her previous efforts, the road to immigration reform is not over, and the next step is now in front of us. Drew Faust should stand with us and our families. She should stand with the computer science major whose father was deported last semester. She should stand with the student whose hometown has decided to build an immigrant detention center to house his family members. She should stand with the student who was forced to take time off school in order to help support a struggling family. President Faust should stand with our families. Harvard should call upon Congress to work together with President Obama to protect the 12 million undocumented individuals who call this country home. DAPA is simply the next logical step; President Faust should support us by publicly endorsing DAPA and thereby setting a precedent for other schools and institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two weeks ago, Germanwings flight 9525 crashed in southern France, killing all 150 passengers, pilots, and cabin crew aboard. Four days ago, al-Shabab affiliated gunmen stormed Garissa University College in eastern Kenya, murdering 147 primarily Christian students. The difference in media coverage has been stark: a quick search of the New York Times website reveals over 300 separate pieces about the crash; a similar search for the Kenya attack returns far fewer. To be sure, an aviation accident is serious news—it wreaks destruction on human lives and affects a mode of transport that over 650 million people use annually in the United States alone. Yet fundamentally, as Americans, as people, and as college students, we should care just as much about 150 people who die in East Africa, in China, or in the Ukraine—especially when they are students—as we do when the tragedy involves 150 air travellers.
The juxtaposition of these two events of such similar death tolls and at such similar times makes the contrast even clearer. The Kenyan incident would seem to have all the markings of a riveting breaking news story: terrorism, a school shooting, and a bloody outcome. Were this same tragedy to befall an American or European university, it’s hard to imagine any other story so much as making the evening news. Indeed, if 12 murders at Charlie Hebdo could bring two million Parisians and dozens of world leaders to the streets of Paris, what would the deaths of 147 students do?
As we have opined in the past, not all terrorist attacks and major crises are treated equally. To the credit of the Western press, the attack on Garissa University has been given some degree of prominence. Still, the balance is far from ideal. It is imperative that equal coverage be given to equally significant events.
Ultimately, however, the problem lies with us. As consumers of media, our clicks and views decide where news agencies go, where they devote their coverage, and what they highlight. In an era of BuzzFeed and Upworthy, when CNN devotes an entire month to endless where-is-MH370 speculation, and where even the The New York Times posts a post-Germanwings crash article devoted solely to begging readers to write in the comments section about their personal feelings on air travel, news organizations know that the surest route to our page views is through sensational news.
News agencies are motivated by advertising dollars, and advertising dollars are motivated by us. When society clamors for minute-by-minute updates on Germanwings, that it shall get.  We must be less parochial in how we view the world, instead caring just as much about far-flung injustice as backyard drama. If we want investigative journalism instead of top ten lists, we must read it. If we want serious international coverage instead of a 75-to-1 ratio of Germanwings to Kenya coverage, we must subscribe to it. And if we want journalistic depth instead of clickbait, we must opt to click on the substance. The differences between the coverage of Kenya and Germanwings are just a microcosm of the broader media landscape, but they offer an opportunity for a way forward: an equal focus on similarly tragic events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Ferguson, Missouri will be holding its first city council elections since Michael Brown was shot and killed last August. The city of Ferguson has been around for 121 years; during those first 120 years, only three black candidates ran for city council. This year, there are four black candidates for the Ferguson city council. This is no coincidence. Many of those in Ferguson realize that to prevent the next police officer’s bullet from killing another unarmed, black teenager, they need the ballot.
Yet, fresh off the heels of the 2014 midterm elections, which saw the lowest voter turnout since World War II, I am still worried. I am worried that our generation is losing sight of what it means to even have the right to vote. I am worried that not enough young people, people of color, and people who care about social justice are participating in the political process.
I understand that low voter turnout is more complex than mere apathy. Despite the great strides made in the past century—from the extension of suffrage to disenfranchised groups, to the democratization of the nomination process, to campaign finance reform—political participation is still a costly act, and the single mother working two jobs might understandably be thinking more about making rent than the platform positions of city council candidates.
However, many of us choose not to exercise our right to vote even when economic hardship is not the issue. Some of us may live in solidly blue or solidly red states, so we feel like our one vote won’t make a difference. Others may have once cared about civic engagement, but have now become disengaged because it seems like it doesn’t matter who gets elected. After all, our federal government seems to be more divided than ever and in December, the 113th Congress just narrowly missed becoming the least productive Congress in history. I understand these frustrations because these are the same cynical thoughts that often run through my mind.
But toward the end of last semester, after an open discussion about U.S. politics and race relations in the Junior Common Room of Winthrop House, I realized that I should never stay home on Election Day. At the discussion, there was an emphasis on the lack of local political participation that produces such non-indictments.
For example, despite a worthy write-in effort, Ferguson prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch ran unopposed in his general election and was reelected in November, just three months after Michael Brown was shot and killed. Legal scholars, including Winthrop House’s very own House Master Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr., have observed that McCulloch played a critical role in the grand jury’s decision not to indict Darren Wilson.
Even though the federal government receives the lion’s share of the media’s attention and the people’s blame when the system produces results that run contrary to justice, if we really want to effect systemic change, we must focus our efforts on the more immediate political and structural conditions that are producing injustice. What happened in Ferguson and Staten Island does not begin with the president. What produced those non-indictments begins with a district attorney. In some cities, it begins with a police chief. In others, it begins with a mayor, or the city council. All of these are locally elected offices that are instrumental in the carrying out of justice, yet they receive too little attention in our political discourse.
That is why it is imperative that those of us who care about social justice do the things that keep those who are locally elected accountable to the principles of justice, equality, opportunity and freedom that we expect them to uphold. This means that we must vote in local elections. It means encouraging those who we know will represent us to run for elected office. Like the four black candidates running for city council in Ferguson, it might even require us to run for office ourselves. There’s a reason why the Constitution begins with three simple, but vital words, “We the People.” It is not only some people who should have a say in what direction our country goes in. Rather it is we, the collective people, who have the power and responsibility to shape this nation into the nation we know it can, and should, be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was 15, my father enrolled my brother and me in an etiquette course. For 60 dollars a head, we enjoyed a three-course gourmet dinner while learning the rules of fine dining. While I’ve since forgotten some of the finer points, like how to position one’s spoon between sips and when it’s appropriate to tilt the bowl, I remember the air of silence that pervaded the room. Dishes appeared and disappeared like magic around us as the servers reacted to our barely perceptible signals. One configuration of fork and knife allowed the diner to pause for conversation—another resulted in the unfinished course being silently whisked away. Dropped silverware was immediately replaced. Wine glasses were refilled instantly, the waiter pouring a constant stream until the diner inclined his head to signal he’d had enough.
Early in the meal, I made the mistake of saying “please” and “thank you” as each of these events occurred until I caught the slight frown of the hostess. Ideally, the transactions between server and served should occur with a minimum of verbal interaction. It occurred to me that this silence helped us to take these workers for granted. Without please and thank you, it was possible to assume that dishes arrived and disappeared because that was the natural order of things, or perhaps because the servers loved their work, and not because they needed the money to put food on the table for their own families.
As a rule, the norms of polite society tend to obscure the experiences of marginalized groups. When speaking about his experiences with racism, Barack Obama talks about being mistaken for a valet. Oprah talks about being told she couldn’t afford a purse. Obama could never mention being called a nigger, although it has almost certainly happened. Oprah would never mention the innuendo that black women face simply walking down the street. Although these forms of violence are commonplace, it is not in good taste to mention them.
Censorship is disproportionately directed against the experiences of women and LGBT people. While the “C word” is considered somewhat offensive when referring to male genitalia, the female “C word” is considered downright unspeakable. Movies that allude to a male receiving oral sex frequently escape with a PG-13 rating, while depictions of female pleasure are usually reserved for restricted audiences. Even in 2015, it is rare to see a same-sex couple kiss on shows directed at a “family audience.” While same-sex couples are more and more frequent on TV, their love is often represented through hugs and fond looks. Movies about same-sex couples tend to receive the MPAA’s harshest ratings, regardless of actual sexual content.
Every few months, a controversy emerges, calling into question the “community standards” upheld by major social media platforms. Many of the most important, though quotidian experiences of women, including breastfeeding and menstruation, are routinely excluded on the basis of arguments that they might offend the average viewer’s sensibilities. In order to defend the comfort of the privileged, disempowered populations are expected to keep their most intimate stories to themselves. Until fairly recently, even the word “pregnant” was considered a bit too vulgar for polite society. Like the dishes at dinner, babies were simply “expected,” with no thought given to why or how they came to be.
Perhaps it is time we radically overhaul the concept of good taste. Maybe we should welcome more interruptions into our pleasant evenings of polite conversation and take the limits off our conversations. Instead of devoting our energies to blocking out things we would “rather not think about” we could learn to integrate them into a holistic experience of life.
Perhaps when we go out for dinner, we should experience a moment of discomfort, however fleeting, when we meditate on the arbitrary stroke of luck that separates the person serving from the person being served. In doing so, we would stand to learn a lot about the populations that the conventional rules of etiquette tend to silence.

Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business’s second annual WIB Week will feature a keynote speech by food industry entrepreneur Jennifer Iannolo and a talk about issues of diversity featuring Deborah Elam, president of the GE Foundation and GE’s Chief Diversity Officer.
The week’s programming, which began on Monday, will also include social events, talks, and workshops about equal opportunity, empowerment in the workplace, and entrepreneurship.
According to WIB Co-President Rosalie H. Nathans '16, the group has expanded its programming this year and has added new events to the week.
“A key initiative this year is increasing diversity among our membership and in the types of programs we offer, so we’ve added a specific diversity event,” Nathan said. “We want to make sure our programs are really open to everyone on campus.”
The week will also include a resume review and a meet-and-greet with female entrepreneurs who have developed innovative marketing tools and products.
According to Nathans, the week’s events aim to introduce students to a broader range of career options in business.
“We’re really interested in encouraging students to consider diverse careers, outside of the usual consulting and finance paths,” Nathan said.
WIB members distributed flyers, snacks, and “WIB”-emblazoned sunglasses to passers-by in the Science Center Plaza on Monday, the first of five days of programming.
According to Sadie R. McQuilkin '16, WIB’s communications chair, WIB Week plays an important role in increasing the organization’s visibility on Harvard’s campus and attracting new members.
“People who aren’t actually involved in WIB tend not to know what we do,” McQuilkin said. “We especially want to reach women in their freshman and sophomore years who might not know about us, but who could comp next fall and have the time to really contribute to the WIB community and to gain valuable experience themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 7, 2015, at 12:08 a.m.
Environmental activism group Divest Harvard said Monday that it will attempt a weeklong blockade of Massachusetts Hall from April 12 to April 17, focusing on barring administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, from entering the central office building.
The “Harvard Heat Week” protest, which organizers originally promoted as a sit-in, aims to bring students, faculty, and alumni to Harvard Yard to demand that the University divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels. Divest member Ben D. Sorscher ’18 said the protest would not disrupt the 14 freshmen who live in Mass. Hall and that Divest members had individually notified each freshman of the plans and scheduled one-on-one meetings with them.
Protesters intend  to form a circle around  Mass. Hall and camp out at night, according to Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15. She added that “hundreds” of advocates of the movement, including dozens of students, are willing to be arrested. The activists have said that they will need 50 to 100 participants in the sit-in each day.
“The time for dialogue has passed. The time for action is now,” Maxmin said to a crowd of 30 people gathered for a Divest teach-in on Monday afternoon.
Sorscher said that at the end of the protest, the activists hope for “a change in stance of the administration from the outright opposing [of divestment] they have right now.”
“We have to be disruptive and...demonstrate that the support is there and that it’s a deep support, that people are willing to take action on this type of movement,” Sorscher said.
“Heat Week” will also include action training, teach-ins, and nightly vigils, according to protest leaders. The movement has already garnered support from students, faculty, staff, and notable alumni, including former Colorado Sen. Timothy E. Wirth ’61 and activist-author Cornel R. West ’74, both of whom will be speaking at events throughout the week. Some students have said they will miss the entire week of class to protest, according to Sorscher.
Divest Harvard has targeted Mass. Hall in the past, previously occupying the building for roughly 24 hours in February and blockading the building last year, when one student was arrested. Harvard did not press charges against the student, Brett A. Roche ’15.
Despite the activists’ demands, Faust has repeatedly argued against divesting from fossil fuels. She has consistently said that Harvard can contribute to environmental sustainability and reduce fossil fuel dependence through research and teaching. Faust has also said that she is wary of making a political statement with Harvard’s finances. On Monday, one Divest member discussed that reasoning.
“Maybe they’re worried that divesting will alienate really huge donors, or maybe they actually do shy away from what they think is only making a political statement by divesting,” Divest member Sidni M. Frederick ’17 said at the teach-in. “They’re making a political statement being invested in the fossil fuel industry.”
Faust has spoken about her own activism in college, when she skipped midterm exams to join a protest in Selma, Ala. Still, she said last month that she does not support the disruption of Harvard business by demonstrators.
“Peaceful protest is absolutely a part of our campus, and they have every right to peacefully protest,” Faust said, referencing the Divest group. “They don't have the right to stop University business.”
Faust said the “breach of perimeters” in the February occupation made her and her staff consider the security issues surrounding Mass. Hall. Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said in a March statement—before the news of the blockade—that HUPD was aware of Divest Harvard’s plans to conduct further protests.
“As always, HUPD will work to safeguard the rights of Harvard community to express their views, while also ensuring the ability of other community members to continue conducting University business, including teaching, learning, research, and administration,” Catalano said at the time.
Faust could not be reached on Monday night. Her spokesperson, Jeff Neal, wrote that he hoped protesters would allow “others the freedom of movement and expression necessary to pursue their lives and work.”

The Harvard Square location of Penti, a hosiery and lingerie shop on JFK St., was closed March 1 by its former owner Haluk M. Ozek in order to consolidate the store’s merchandise with the nearby boutique Monella on 29 Brattle St.
Penti is an international Turkish franchise that opened in Harvard Square three years ago.
According to Ozek, the owner of both the former Penti store and Monella, the consolidation offers a more streamlined and complete customer experience.
“The aim is to create a better retail store, where the customer can have a better shopping experience,” Ozek said.
According to Ozek, moving Penti's products to Monella, which carries clothing and accessories, gives customers a more comprehensive selection in one place.
“When the customer comes in to buy Penti products they may take a look around and see if there is anything [in Monella] they like.” Ozek said.
He added that consolidating the two stores also eliminates the need to pay rent on two locations.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she currently does not know what business will replace Penti.

UPDATED: April 6, 2015, at 10:58 p.m.
The Bureau of Study Counsel, currently a part of Harvard University Health Services, will report administratively to Harvard College starting in July.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced the change in a community email Monday morning. Created in 1947, the BSC has functioned in tandem with other offices, including the Accessible Education Office and the Advising Programs Office, designed to assist students with their academic and other problems, according to Harris. Since those offices operate individually, all “with distinct mandates,” the lack of coordination has been a “source of some frustration” for administrators, he said.
Under the umbrella of UHS for the past 11 years, the BSC has created additional organizational difficulties for administrators, Harris said.
“The Bureau was brought fully under the umbrella of UHS, and that meant it was not part of the College, even as, of course, most of its work was with College students,” he said. “We’ve been thinking for some time now  of how we can, first of all, bring the Bureau back to the College, so that it can be much more a part of this academic support team but also how we can coordinate all of these services better.”
By bringing the BSC under the purview of the College, academic administrators also hope to collect better academic aggregate data for better targeted student services and future programming, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education for Academic Support Ann Gaylin said.
“It has been very hard to understand who needs what, in a broad sense, and this will enable us to get a better handle on who are our students who are experiencing challenges and what kinds of resources can be deployed to better support them,” Gaylin said in an interview attended by Harris, BSC Director Abigail Lipson, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane.
Lipson agreed with Gaylin that better targeted aggregate data will enable the Bureau to reach out to students in need, including those who “feel shy about coming in and seeking services,” Lipson said.
The BSC, as it was conceived, had hired professional counselors who focused both on academic and mental health support, according to UHS Director Paul J. Barreira, who spoke to The Crimson Monday afternoon with a spokesperson, Lindsey Baker, present.
“It was...a hybrid model,” Barreira said. “It provided both the academic learning center activity and counseling, as in professional counseling activity. And people had viewed that as value-added for students.”
Barreira said that this model, however, does not reflect the current needs of students.
“Maybe the time has come that the hybrid model has sort of had its moment, its long moment, in history, and to better provide the academic support to students, it’s time for the Bureau to return to the College exclusively as an academic support, learning center office,” he added.
Without BSC counselors under its purview, UHS will be moving some mental health-related offices to its fourth floor, currently the home of the Stillman Infirmary whose overnight care facility will close at the end of this academic year. In addition, UHS will increase its personnel to provide counseling services for students who previously had received professional counseling from the BSC, Barreira said.
At the same time, since BSC staff members will no longer need clinical licenses, the Bureau will expand to include other professionals focused on mitigating students’ academic difficulties, Gaylin said.
When separated, the BSC and UHS’ Counseling and Mental Health Services still may operate in a “bidirectional” way, with staff members referring students to the appropriate resources, Barreira said.
Administrators also are looking to change the name of the BSC to clarify its mission as an academic support office, they said.
Two options on the table are the “Center for Learning and Academic Support (CLAS)” and “Academic Life Learning Office (ALLO).” To discuss new names and other aspects of the BSC, Harris invited undergraduates to participate in a town hall meeting in the Phillips Brooks House Association parlor room on Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates at the College spread far and wide during the summer months, and as the number of computer science concentrators continues to grow, a group of students aims to foster relationships for those signing onto internships in the San Francisco area, where both large companies and start-ups attract students.
Spearheaded by Tomas A. Reimers ’17, Gregory M. Foster ’17, Nicholas J. Mahlangu ’16, Roger M. Zurawicki ’16,  and Aran Khanna ’16, most of whom are part of the board for student organization Hack Harvard, "Summer Camp," as the group calls it, originated from a perceived lack of Harvard community among undergraduate interns in San Francisco.
Reimers, who previously interned at Yelp, said that while the company itself had a well-established intern program, there were far fewer opportunities to meet Harvard students in the Bay Area.
“I would go to events for various tech companies over the summer and would discover that there were other students who I didn’t know were in the city,” Reimers said. “I wondered why we hadn’t all met up.”
According to the program’s student leaders, the group hopes to partner with several tech companies for networking events, but they will place greater focus on giving students the opportunity to form their own social connections with fellow Harvard undergraduates.
“There are always tons of things going on in San Francisco, like street fairs and free concerts, that will be much more attractive to go to if people know other students that are willing to go with them,” Foster said.
In particular, the group intends to aid College students in the process of finding housing. Reimers said that searching for housing across the country can be daunting. He added that he experienced this first-hand prior to his San Francisco-based internship, and a last-minute switch led to him rooming with Foster.
“Knowing about the various neighborhoods in the city and finding other people to live with is very important when trying to find housing,” Reimers said.
The "Summer Camp" leaders noted that they already received more than 50 responses to a questionnaire they distributed over email lists to locate undergraduates relevant for the program. From these responses, they are in the process of developing a roommate search tool, according to Mahlangu.
While the group may expand the program to other colleges in future summers, for now it is focused on helping Harvard students build connections with each other and alumni in the area, Foster said.
“There’s a whole Harvard network that we’re hoping students can plug into through this program,” Foster said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor spoke about the challenges of long-term political decisionmaking in an address at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Monday.
The event, moderated by Shira T. Center, a political editor at the Boston Globe, comes a little less than ten months after Cantor’s primary loss to Randolph-Macon College economics professor David Brat in the race to represent for Virginia’s 7th congressional district in the House of Representatives. Cantor currently serves as vice chairman and managing director at the investment bank Moelis & Company and is one of the IOP’s spring visiting fellows.
Throughout the discussion, Cantor emphasized that the incentive to respond to the “siren of short-termism” is a powerful political force that deters long-term solutions.
“Although one who offers himself up for elected office does so with a long-term vision in mind, to affect some good, there are some forces in work in our electoral system that tend to be much more short-term in nature,” Cantor said. “Just the very sense of a two-year term as a member of Congress tends to be something that is powerful.”
Cantor cited heavy short-term pressure from conservative interest groups as one reason that comprehensive immigration reform has yet to be achieved, stating that there was “very little prospect” of further movement on the issue until after the 2016 presidential election. Cantor said he personally supports granting citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants, despite the fact that many conservative groups would label such an action as “amnesty.”
Cantor alleged that the refusal of the far left to discuss potential improvements to the Wall Street reform bill known as Dodd-Frank was an example of a similar lack of the spirit of compromise on the liberal end of the spectrum.
“Honestly, there’s no perfect law or legislation—anything can be improved,” Cantor said. “And there’s instances where one wants to improve Dodd-Frank to make it work better, but yet some on the extreme left would say ‘we’re not touching it.’”
Cantor also criticized President Barack Obama, saying that the president’s lack of effort in engaging with the Republicans “on a personal level” and inability to “recogn[ize] political sensibilities” was at least in part responsible for the lack of bipartisan cooperation in Washington.
“What’s missing is the human element, that above all else can at the end of the day force or at least prompt someone—if they’re at all reasonable—into solving problems, risking taking steps that may not be totally what one wants but…could bring people together,” Cantor said.
Regarding his failed bid at reelection, Cantor said that a political miscalculation was to blame, combined with his support of various initiatives that he said did not gain unanimous support from his Republican base.
“The mistake made in my primary was the assumption that we had Republicans only voting,” Cantor concluded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu ’07 walked into a coffee shop for an interview one bright afternoon in February carrying a diaper bag and her bundled-up four-month-old son, Blaise.
She was visibly tired. Wu, the youngest member of the City Council and the first Asian-American woman to serve as a councilor, had a resolution and two measures in the works. To add on to that, as she explained, she had not exactly been sleeping well, newborn and all. She had lost her voice and could barely be heard above the quiet chatter of the coffee shop.
Blaise, quiet through most of the conversation, started crying in irritation.
“You’re coming out, you’re coming out,” she said in Mandarin as she tried to wriggle him out of his blue and yellow striped onesie. She switched back to English and apologized. “I really think I have to change his diaper.”
One of the measures that Wu had on her mind was a plan to introduce paid parental leave for City of Boston employees. The ordinance, which has garnered the support of Mayor Martin J. Walsh and was co-authored with Councilor Tim McCarthy last month, would give six weeks of paid parental leave to both men and women, same-sex couples included, who have worked for the City for at least one year. The proposal faces a hearing on April 22.
The idea of parental paid leave ordinance, for Wu, began when she became pregnant and was not able to obtain paid leave. She realized then the difficulties that City of Boston employees face, she said, as they try to juggle work life and family life.
Drawing on personal experience is not an unusual policy tactic for Wu. In her first term on the Council, Wu a Harvard College and Law School graduate who once started a small business and is the daughter of immigrants, has fought for greater language access, and to make it easier for small restaurants to obtain liquor licenses.
From rearing a child to struggling to support a family under stress—it is Wu’s personal history that has shaped much of her political trajectory.
FROM CHICAGO TO BOSTON
Born the child of Taiwanese immigrants, Wu moved from Chicago to Cambridge, Mass., for college in 2003. At Harvard, she took heritage speaker Chinese and concentrated in Economics. She tap-danced, and, on the weekends, crossed the river to teach citizenship classes in Chinatown.
But after she received her undergraduate degree, her mother became ill. Wu, the oldest of four siblings, was forced to leave her consulting job and go back to Chicago. There, in a difficult time, she—with the help of her boyfriend and now-husband Conor Pewarski—helped her mother through treatment, took care of her two younger siblings, and started a mom-and-pop tea house to support the family financially.
She moved back to Cambridge in 2009 and attended Harvard Law School. Her start in politics began with an internship with former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino. Then, when her professor and mentor Elizabeth Warren ran for senate in 2012, Wu found a job on the Warren campaign.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, the president of Harvard College Democrats, still remembers the speech Wu gave to the Harvard Dems at a Warren campaign kick-off rally in 2012.
“She’s someone I think a lot of people on the [Harvard College] Dems admire immensely,” he said. “I think she’s done a really good job of engaging Harvard students, to the degree that students in Cambridge feel connected to a councilor in Boston.”
Wu announced her campaign for City Councilor at Large a few months after the Warren campaign. Then, it was to the streets—running on a campaign platform of increasing access and connecting families to opportunities, Wu garnered almost 60,000 votes in a victory that had some calling her the future of Boston politics.
But her councilorship got off to a rocky start. In December 2013, she backed South Boston Councilor Bill Linehan’s bid to become the next council president over a younger, more liberal contender, and some accused her of betraying her progressive image. “Michelle Wu’s base could crumble over council president vote,” a Boston Globe headline read.
“I’ve always said that I would be thoughtful in my decision-making and be transparent about my reasoning,” Wu wrote. “[I] ask all my constituents to judge my performance based on my record and accessibility.”
HERE TO STAY
As a City Councilor, Wu has advocated for language access, small-time business owners, and divestment of state retirement funds from fossil fuels. She helped reform an antiquated permitting system, and introduced “Bring Your Own Bottle” to make it easier on small restaurants that could not afford a liquor license. She fought for the continuation of the late-night T on weekends.
“Many students after they graduate college immediately think about going to [other cities], so what we need to do as a city is do a better job of retaining the talent that comes here,” she said earlier this year. “Part of that is that Boston needs to be more welcoming place for young people, and having an exciting, accessible nightlife, is a big part of that.”
Her latest initiative—to bring six weeks of paid parental leave to Boston city employees—has put her in the spotlight. The proposed measure would give eligible city employees 100 percent of the salary for the first two weeks, 75 percent for the next two, and 50 percent for the final two.
For Wu, the first councilor to give birth while serving in office, fighting for paid parental leave is the latest in a series of measures that she has taken since her election to advocate on behalf of those she says are underrepresented.
“The very people who might have the most stake in changing the system aren’t able to have a voice,” Wu said, referring to parents with newborns. She added that the burdens of child-rearing can often leave parents too busy to advocate for their households at the political table.
The ordinance has seen the support of the mayor, who co-wrote an op-ed in the Globe with Wu endorsing the paid parental leave measure.
“This is something that the mayor has...been working hard on [even during his campaign] and realized very quickly with Councilor Wu that both parties wanted to see go forward,” said Daniel A. Koh ’07, Walsh’s chief of  staff. “I think this is a first step in a larger effort to really set an example to say that this is something other companies should really be doing.”
For Wu, Boston has become a permanent home. And even as she has to take care of a newborn and her younger sister—in addition to helping run city government—Wu said that life is a lot more manageable now that her mother’s condition has stabilized.
As for the future, Wu said that she hopes to encourage more young people to enter politics and remain in the city of Boston. The twice-over Harvard grad said she aims to engage Harvard students in the hopes that they, like her, will fall in love with the city and stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After scoring just four runs last Monday against Penn, the Crimson bats came alive, erupting for 37 runs in four games against Ivy foes Princeton and Cornell over the Easter weekend.
Though senior outfielder Mike Martin went 5-for-8 and sophomore infielder Drew Reid went 4-for-8 at the dish in the doubleheader against the Big Red, it was a new face that shone brightest for all four games—freshman infielder John Fallon.
Though the Houston native entered Harvard’s first Ivy homestand with just three hits in 14 at bats, with just one run batted in, Fallon clearly showed that past performance isn’t necessarily the best indicator of future performance.
“Opportunities are scarce, so I had to take advantage of every opportunity I get,” Fallon said. “I guess this weekend was a pretty good showing for me.”
A “good showing” might have been quite an understatement. The freshman infielder went 11-for-15 in the four weekend games and also had five runs scored and eight runs batted in to boot.
“I think [it was] just being comfortable up there hitting, seeing the ball real well, getting some good swings off earlier in the count,” Fallon said. “The guys that were on the field with me were great...on base getting the pitcher nervous.”
Tiger and Big Red pitching staffs struggled all weekend to get the ball by Fallon, with the Crimson’s number seven hitter now batting .667 in Ivy play with a .778 slugging average.
The performance was a feat that did not go unnoticed by more veteran players on the team.
“I remember back in my freshman year…. It’s always hard for freshman to adjust to their roles on the team,” senior infielder Jake McGuiggan said. “I think that it’s definitely hard for a situation with John where he didn’t play a lot early on in the season. it’s been great over the last week to see him not only in the game against Holy Cross, but [also] in the four games these weekend and step up and be a huge addition to our offense. The more he gets comfortable having that role as a freshman, the better he’s gonna be off individually and the better of our team is gonna be.”
Despite the prominent role that he has quickly claimed as a part of the batting order, Fallon had a rough go-around at the beginning of the season. The 6’3” Texas product went 0-for-3 with a strikeout in the Crimson’s first game of 2015, way back on Feb. 27 at Wofford.
After that first game, Fallon did not see his name penciled into the starting lineup until seven games later in the Crimson’s 7-1 loss to Mercer on March 8. And just as his first start, Fallon went hitless in three plate appearances—but did have a walk.
Then, from March 15 to the second game of the doubleheader against Penn, Fallon watched from the bench as the Crimson first had a five-game win streak and then a four-game losing streak before he made his way back onto Harvard coach Bill Decker’s starting lineup card.
After this four-game weekend of dominance at the plate, one has to wonder what the Crimson offense may have missed out on with Fallon not in the lineup.
“Anytime [John] can get on base three-fourths [of the time] on average, that’s just incredible, because that paces the rest of the offense,” McGuiggan said. “I think it’s huge for us offensively to have John playing so well—he’s been very steady at third base and shortstop over the last week. He has a strong arm which can make some plays for us, we’re definitely excited to see what he has in store for us.”
Even before Fallon came to play for the Crimson out of high school ball in Houston, the coaches and players could see that the recruit had potential that can extend past a single weekend.
“I think it’s one of those situations where he needed a chance to get in there and play on a consistent basis for all that talent to really show,” McGuiggan said. “I think that over the last week or so he’s been able to get some consistent reps out there, not only defensively but [also with] plenty of outback plays—I think that’s really important for any baseball player whether you’re a freshman or anyone else—to get that consistency and get in the groove. I think he’s definitely found his groove this week.”

From traditional cultural dance to modern hip-hop, “Eastbound” presented a full array of entertainment to its audience this Saturday. The show, presented by the Asian American Dance Troupe, celebrated another year of dance with over 100 participants, which is one of the largest group of performers to date. The captivating dances and spellbinding precision may have absorbed everyone’s attention, but this Roving Reporter still attempted to converse with performers and audience members.
Ding Zhou ’16, audience member
RR: What was your favorite dance?
Ding: I liked Fade to Black.
RR: Could you dance like that?
Ding: No, I can’t.
RR: How many hours do you think AADT put into this show?
Ding: I assume they’ve been practicing all year.
Vi Nguyen ’15, performer
RR: How much time did you put into this?
Vi: Every week until two weeks before, we had around two to three hours of practice each [week]. Two weeks before the dance, we had around an average of four to five, and we also had a really long dress rehearsal and tech rehearsal.
RR: What was your favorite part of “Eastbound”?
Vi: My favorite part was seeing it come all together at dress rehearsal because we practiced all on our own, so it was really nice to see the progress everyone made.
RR: Did anyone mess up?
Vi: I think a lot of people did…. But I think everyone has fun with it, and because we have fun with it, no one notices and we don’t notice.
Ping Yuan, parent
RR: What brought you all the way from Michigan?
Ping: We just wanted to represent our family and give [our daughter] more support. This is very important.
RR:What have you thought of the show so far?
Ping: It’s very nice, even the little ones [referring to a dance with young performers from Westwood Chinese School].
RR: Has your daughter been dancing since she was that young?
Ping: Yeah, since she was five. She started with ballet.
Melissa C. Lee ’17, audience member
RR: What have you thought of the show so far?
Melissa: It’s been great. I’ve had a lot of friends in the production, and I’ve listened to them talk about AADT, and they’ve worked really hard. It’s really nice to see that all the hard work has become such a great show.
RR: What was your favorite dance so far?
Melissa: The one just now [Hyde]. There was something about the energy.
Roland M. Salatino ’16, MC and performer
RR: Do you think you’re funny?
Roland: I hope so! When I'm writing MC scripts and I think of something that cracks me up, I write it down. Hopefully everyone else likes it too.
RR: What’s the worst part of being an MC?
Roland: The worst part of being an MC is memorizing lines or taping together notecards with the script on them.
RR: What was the most awkward moment in the show?
Roland: The most awkward moment in the show.... I don't know! I had fun with the whole thing. Even the parts where my co-MC got to make fun of me a little were really funny, and I even helped her write some of those parts.
Tina Q. Huang ’18, performer
RR: What was your favorite part of “Eastbound?”
Tina: I think my favorite part of “Eastbound” was being able to show all our friends and family what we’ve been working on for the entire year. Our dance group had really become a little family; it was really awesome to all be on the stage together.

The Intrinsics, a Harvard-based soul band started two years ago by Rachel S. Horn ’14 and Ethan I. Simon ’16 will be opening for Yardfest on April 24th. The band will play alongside another Harvard opening act, Black Tie Affair, after winning “Battle for Yardfest” on March 27th. As our campus community gears up for what is likely to be a crazy weekend with a Jessie J concert followed immediately by Visitas and a series of house (and freshman!!) formals, Flyby caught up with one of our opening acts to hear about their experience as a band and what they want Crimson readers to know:
Flyby: So who is in the band? 
The Intrinsics: We’re a whole variety of years, and not all of us are students at Harvard. Our band leader is Ethan Simon ’16 who plays keys, our lead singer is Nadia Urrea ’17, Jeremy Sabath (currently on leave from Harvard) sings and plays the trombone, Ben Sobel ’15 plays tenor sax, John Tournas ’16 plays alto baritone sax, Alex Graff ’17 plays the guitar (“Alex is effortlessly the best musician I’ve ever heard” says Sabath), Mateo Gold plays drums and is class of ’15 at Berklee along with Jordan Lagana (bass) and Tree Palmedo (trumpet).
Flyby: What type of music do you play?
Jeremy Sabbath: We are primarily a soul music band, so we focus on the classic sounds of Southern soul with motown, R&B with influences from James Brown, Otis Redding, and Etta James. We love the music we play, and the idea is for our body of work to be unequivocally fun music. Sometimes, we choose a new song because someone texts the group chat and says, “I’d love to play this,” and that’s how we choose what to learn next.
Flyby: What is it like to be in this group of people?
Mateo Gold: We’ve been in this band for two school years, and sometimes it feels like ten years, because it’s like a relationship. We go through times when it’s really rough and also times where it’s really, really fun. At the beginning of this school year, we had a four-month long rough patch where we were like, ‘we don’t like this.’ And we were honestly pretty close to breaking up. But I think we’ve stuck through with it because we all fundamentally love the music that we play when we’re together.
Flyby: The Intrinsics have released three new songs recently, with five originals. (You can find them here). What is the songwriting process like? 
Ethan Simon: Well, Rachel (one of the other original founders of my band), was my writing partner, and so I was working on this tune, and then I emailed her and got some feedback, and I’ve been working on it for about a year. I think Tree writes songs to write songs - ours are both not about anyone in particularly. Ben went through a really rough breakup, so his song, “I’m Stepping Out,” is a little angrier. But overall we want the songs we write to be unpretentious and fun to listen to it.
Nadia Urrea: They just feel good when you play them, like a lot of our songs. And don’t let them fool you, it’s not easy to write music.
Flyby: What is your favorite part of working with these group of people?
Ethan Simon: I think it’s been cool for me because if you ask our typical audience member if they like the type of music that we play, most of them won’t say “soul” is something they typically listen to. But no matter what event we play at, people love it and dance. Like at Battle for Yardfest, no one on their own would have chosen soul music, but there is something innate to the human experience about the way that it sounds. Everyone understands it. And from our side, everyone in the band wants our music to be fun and very good. Having this type of music in our life is important to all of us.
Flyby: What do you hope for as the future of the band? 
The Intrinsics: We’d really love to be able to bring our music to more people, and take our band (although we love the Harvard fanbase) to clubs in Boston, for example, and out of a single college market. One of our band values is to be valued for what we do, and it would be amazing for us to play more frequently at places where people love our music and come just to hear our sounds.
