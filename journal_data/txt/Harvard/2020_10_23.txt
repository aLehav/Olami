After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the election draws closer, I’ve got one number on my mind: 114 climate deniers sitting in the United States House of Representatives.
Young people alone have the power to oust 96 of them.
Young Americans overwhelmingly care about the environment. We’re going to pay the price if today’s leaders refuse to act aggressively against catastrophic climate change. Flipping those seats should be a top priority for young organizers, because although the presidential race gets most of our collective attention, it’s actually up to Congress to enact the policies on climate change adaptation and mitigation that could save our planet. Young voters can play a crucial role in voting climate deniers out of office — but only if we vote, and vote all the way down the ballot.
Unfortunately, voter turnout among younger Americans drags miserably behind every other age group. After five years of living in extreme drought conditions in California, it was clear to me and my friends that climate action was on the ballot in 2016. I was crushed to watch half of eligible 18-29-year-olds stay home that November, America’s second warmest November month on record.
In the 2018 midterms, a follow-up climate referendum, young voter turnout surged 16 percentage points from the previous midterm election, when it stood at an embarrassing 20 percent; that energy was rewarded by aggressive legislation in Congress, including the Green New Deal.
Now, climate change is back on the ballot in 2020 — just ask anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area, where an epic rash of wildfires is taking its toll, triggering more loss of life and livelihood, and producing another respiratory epidemic as we struggle to contain COVID-19.
At the presidential level, climate voters have a clear champion: Joe Biden has the most progressive climate agenda of any major party nominee in American history. But is that platform, buried under the pageantry of the Democratic National Committee, enough to get climate-conscious young people to the polls? For all but the most politically engaged, I’m not so sure.
If we want down-ballot turnout in support of Congressional candidates who accept climate science, we need to stop relying on Biden’s coattails and start telling a better story of how your vote can make a difference. Here’s the message that young people need to hear to know that their vote will move the needle on climate action: Come November, 18-29-year-olds will constitute a large enough voting bloc to kick these climate deniers out of office.
In 96 of the Congressional districts represented by a climate denier, the incumbent’s 2018 margin of victory falls short of the number of 18-29-year-olds in the district, according to combined statistics from the Cook Political Report and the U.S. Census Bureau. In these target districts, a wave of youth turnout could prove decisive and send a sitting climate denier packing.
And we don’t need 100 percent turnout before young voters start making a difference — each marginal vote counts. If an additional two percent of 18-29-year-olds get fired up in each district and march to the polls, three climate-denying incumbents could lose their seat. If an additional 20 percent cast ballots, up to 23 climate deniers are underwater.
And that’s an attainable goal: According to the Institute of Politics’ Harvard Youth poll released last month, 63 percent of young people reported that they would “definitely” vote in November, up more than 20 points from this time in 2018.
As young voter turnout goes up, so too will the number of seats in play. A 50 percentage-point increase in turnout in each district could jeopardize the seats of a whopping 57 climate deniers — and all of this even before the additional voting power of adults 30-and-up tip the scale.
It may seem a fool’s errand to bring climate messaging to the center of mainstream get-out-the-vote efforts in this strange, strange year (although organizations like Environmental Voter Project and NextGen America are doing tremendous work to activate single-issue climate voters). But nothing happens in a vacuum. Climate policy and COVID-19 policy are inextricably linked: The unwillingness to accept scientific consensus on climate change is akin to the rejection of public health guidance on containing the pandemic.
Likewise, young voters are acutely aware that climate justice is racial justice: Those of our generation who turned out in droves, to the street or in spirit, to protest systemic racism know that the burdens of climate change are disproportionately borne by communities of color.
The stakes are high, and not voting is a vote against climate justice. Unless we make a concerted effort to mobilize young climate voters around Congressional elections, Joe Biden won’t have the support to enact the climate agenda we need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While our world seems all too dystopian in the era of COVID and the general chaos that is 2020, Instagram insists utopia is alive and well. We scroll through our feeds to see a world altogether different from our own, as if somewhere beyond, an alternate reality exists. Even though we see illness and unrest on the news, smiling faces and pretty colors in neat little squares are on our phones. It’s jarring, even grotesque, to notice this disconnect — to both observe and participate in a tacit whitewash of reality.
So why do we fabricate a world that is only half authentic? Evidently, we want to appear better than we are (likely) feeling right now. It’s a thin veneer and we’re probably well aware that singular posted moments of happiness and glamour aren’t entirely representative of our actual lives. However, the self-advertising appeal is unresistable, partly because we competitively seek to prove that we’re just fine despite the world falling apart around us. But also on some level, to console ourselves.
Within the COVID-era social void, Instagram offers an alluring sense of belonging and connection. These are, according to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, among humans’ greatest urgencies after all. To see our friends, even just on a screen, numbs the pain of isolation at least superficially. Moreover, Instagram provides validation we crave. Psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman affirms that stability is contingent on self-esteem, but it cannot be mastered like levels “until you’ve ‘won’ the game of life,” as Maslow’s scheme suggests. Rather, Kaufman contends that the hierarchy of needs is more like a sailboat in which connection and self-esteem constitute the boat itself, and which must continuously navigate “a vast ocean” of life. In other words, as we sail, we repeatedly attempt to overcome our insecurities to achieve steadiness. And for many, positive affirmation online feels like the way to do it.
But this dependency quickly morphs into obsession and addiction. We go to great lengths to “do it for the gram,” some literally sacrificing their lives for it. Since 2011, more than 250 people have died from selfie-related accidents just to capture postable moments.
Clearly, Instagram goes beyond addiction. It’s a way of life — a religion. It influences how we live and who we chose to be. The content we post is nothing short of prophetic; we’re telling stories and creating narratives through appealing photos to convince others we are attractive, desirable, content, okay even though times are tough and we may not be. We’re delivering the message that we have a good life — that we have chosen “the good life” and will lead “the right life” — according to some divinely ordained cultural standard.
Jesus, Mohammed, and Abraham sought followers to further their faithful missions. And our objective isn’t so different from theirs. We draw attention to ourselves to gain a following because it lets us know our lives are important. Posts amassing many likes are treated as gospel and individuals with many followers are worshipped. Through these life affirming statistics, of course, we believe redemption is possible. As a result, we preach about ourselves in the name of convincing others that we are acceptable.
Most impressively, our ability to persuade holds immense power. Following the rules, we can change how others perceive us. And if we can convince others, we can convert them. Instagrammers partake in mob mentality through blind faith. They solidify an unwritten Instagram scripture we are to follow, and full disclosure, I’m following it too – even if I’m not sure why.
We have created complex rules and taboos that accept some and reject others. In a non-spiritual fashion, Instagram religion doesn’t welcome everyone into its community. Those who don’t conform are heretics while pious posters are rewarded. But why is it a sin to post a picture the masses don’t find “aesthetic?” Why do I have to wear less clothing to receive more praise?
This system of purification seems antithetical; a platform designed expressly for connection makes us feel ostracized or even more isolated than we already are. The line between religion and cult seems to be a fine one. But the prospect of disaffiliation is equally threatening; for many right now, it’s one of the only ways to stay in touch with others.
One of the biggest problems here is that we have profound goals which we are trying to achieve within a superficial system. Let’s face it, we are young and we just want others to like us, maybe even love us. We want to talk to friends. We want to relate to others and be told what we care about matters. Even if we are just angsty, these are healthy human feelings. So when we emotionally and psychologically invest so much in a fundamentally inhuman system and try to distill these sentiments into likes and follows, we close our apps feeling unfulfilled. Likes simply expose whose attention we have caught in the moment, but aren’t necessarily signs of faith or loyalty. And followers are certainly not disciples. We’re all just preaching to each other — only sometimes convincingly, and even so, the conviction isn’t necessarily lasting or profound. The old cliché may still be right; a picture is worth a thousand words (or a thousand likes?). Nevertheless, a thousand words isn’t nearly enough to sum up a person or a life.
What we should realize, then, is that we’re sacrificing ourselves on the wrong altar. Instagram is religion gone wrong. It divides more than it unites and encourages competition rather than support. Instead of arriving at self-acceptance, we repeatedly give others power to validate or reject what we find valuable. We’ve lost track of the fact that Instagram is exactly what it sounds like: instant. And instants only. Instants are important, but they’re far from life in its entirety. We shouldn’t let mere snapshots dictate our self worth or expectations. Believe it or not, Instagram won’t grant us salvation. Our generation needs to internalize this sentiment in order to reassess our priorities. To get in touch with everlasting fulfillment or a true sense of belonging, we should turn away from the dogma. Being iconoclast will be more rewarding in the end.

Researchers at Harvard and Northwestern University derived the first tight limit for the spin of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
The recent location of 40 new “S-stars” near the Sagittarius A* black hole prompted the research, according to Astronomy professor Avi Loeb, co-author of the study and researcher at Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics. Loeb and his co-author developed a measuring technique based on the spatial distribution of those stars around the black hole.
The pair — who published their work in the Astrophysical Journal Letters earlier this month — used the stars’ unique geometry to measure the black hole’s spin. Loeb said that his research builds on the work of Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the mass of the supermassive black hole.
“It’s just like if you know the first name of a person and you don’t know their last name, then you can’t really identify them or how they grew up,” Loeb said. “In the same way astrophysical black holes are characterized by two numbers: mass and spin. So if you know just one of them it only gives you partial information.”
The spin of the black hole is extremely slow, said co-author Giacomo Fragione, a researcher at Northwestern’s Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics.
“We realized that we actually can use these geometrical configuration[s] to constrain the spin,” Fragione said.
Black holes are generally characterized by their mass and spin, provided that their charge is neutral and therefore negligible. Measuring the mass of a black hole is relatively straightforward, but determining the spin is more complex.
Loeb and Fragione, however, used the recently discovered S-stars and their close proximity to Sagittarius A* to estimate its spin.
The S-stars that orbit the supermassive black hole are dispersed throughout two disks; stars in each disk rotate in opposite directions around the supermassive black hole. Examining the stars’ positions relative to the black hole allowed Loeb and Fragione to determine an upper limit for the spin.
They reasoned that if the orbitals of S-stars stabilize over time, there must be a constraint on the magnitude of the spin. The spin of the supermassive black hole must be less than 0.1, per their calculations.
“We now have a tight constraint, and we know that it has a low spin. Why is that important? It says something about how this black hole grew to become what it is right now,” Loeb said.
Loeb said he hopes scientists will discover more stars near black holes and use their orbitals and the unique geometry they form to estimate the black holes’ spin.
“If there are stars closer in, one can put even tighter constraints on the spin, as long as they reside in the same orbital plane as the stars farther up. So hopefully more stars will be found,” Loeb said. “These stars not only enable us to test Einstein’s theory of general relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity, but they also allow us to set tighter constraints on the spin.”

In the wake of renewed conversation on campus about academic freedom and inclusion, Harvard’s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston said she encourages students to “think about calling in, versus calling out” individuals with whom they disagree.
Last week, Charles A. Murray ’65 — whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center terms “racist pseudoscience” — spoke to affiliates at a webinar hosted by Government Department preceptor David D. Kane, provoking widespread dissatisfaction among department affiliates.
“What I would love to see us do is embrace more opportunities to really engage in dialogue across difference, which is not necessarily about the specific incident but speaks more broadly to this question of, how do we engage when we vehemently disagree with people who are on the opposite side of an issue as us?” Charleston said in an interview with The Crimson on Wednesday.
She said she is “struck” by what she described as a “cancel culture” among some students, and encouraged students instead to “think about calling in versus calling out,” which she described as engaging in “genuine inquiry.”
“It means I’m going to engage with you in genuine inquiry to figure out why you think the way that you think and in listening to you and learning from your perspective,” she said. “Perhaps I challenge it, perhaps I reject it, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that I exclude you from public debate in the public forum just because I don’t want to hear it,” she added.
The question of who should be allowed to speak “in a public forum” — specifically, on college campuses — is neither new to Harvard nor to higher education.
In the 1980s, protests erupted in response to controversial speakers on campus, including former Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger and Nicaraguan Contra Jorge Rosales. The last time Murray spoke at Harvard in 2017, some students said he should not be allowed a platform on campus.
Though the Faculty of Arts and Sciences adopted formal Free Speech Guidelines in 1990 to protect the “right to express unpopular views,” the issue remains far from settled on campus.
In fact, the final report of former University President Drew Faust’s Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, released in 2018, named the “union of academic freedom and a culture of mutual respect and concern” as one of its “four goals for inclusive excellence.”
The report also established the post that Charleston now holds, tasking her with implementing its recommendations.
Charleston said she believes “academic freedom, freedom of speech, [and] academic inquiry” are “core to the mission of higher education.”
“Sometimes that means that we will have vigorous disagreement around those who might be present within the context of higher education,” she added.
Her comments on academic freedom and free speech echo those of other administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
At the same time, Charleston also said she recognizes the importance of students feeling safe on campus.
“I do think that we have a responsibility on campus to be thinking about how we make sure that our students feel safe, how we make sure that our students feel protected,” she said. “This is your home, and that is par for the course.”
She said she believes that responsibility is sometimes fulfilled by helping students “develop the tools to critically engage, challenge [and] disagree” with individuals whose views they abhor, a belief she credits in part to her background as an attorney.
“There is a part of me that truly does believe in this process through which we can vigorously disagree, and we can dissent, and we can debate, and through that process, we would hope that the best arguments and the truth would rise to the top,” she said.
Charleston also said it is important to give others “the space and the grace to be able to grow and change their ideas about things, as opposed to cutting them off at the knees.”
“We can do that at the same time that we take unequivocal stances that there are some things that we won’t tolerate,” she said.

More than a dozen scientists — including faculty from the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School — called for greater transparency and reproducibility in clinical artificial intelligence models in the scientific journal Nature last Wednesday.
The group submitted the commentary in response to a study published in Nature in January 2020, in which a deep-learning model was found to screen for breast cancer more effectively than human radiologists. Led by researchers at Google Health, the study used datasets from the United Kingdom and the United States to assess the model’s performance in a clinical setting.
Commentary co-author John Quackenbush, who chairs the School of Public Health’s Biostatistics Department, said novel technologies like the breast cancer screening model should be reproducible on independent data sets.
“If we have this method that finds the scans or finds breast cancer tumors and characterizes them in these scans, whether we run it on their original data set or another data set, we should be able to verify and validate,” he said.
Quackenbush noted that many previous experiments have used AI technologies with great success. He cited the use of diagnostic models for breast cancer and genomic data for predicting different cancers’ drug responses as notable examples. However, these experiments released neither their data nor the codes used in their models, according to Quackenbush, leading to doubts about the data's robustness and dependability.
“We should be able to take the same methodology and run it on independent data sets and test whether or not we can reproduce the results,” he said. “These are real hallmarks of reproducibility in science.”
Quackenbush said clinical trials demand a higher degree of transparency and reproducibility because an integral part of the scientific method is being able to independently replicate data.
“The lowest bar for investigational studies was: could an independent investigator take the same method and the same data and reproduce the analysis? But once you went into a clinical setting, there was a much higher bar,” Quackenbush said.
“If we’re actually talking about clinical applications, you have to make the code available. You have to make the models available,” he added.
Quackenbush also underscored the importance of maintaining scientific integrity despite the excitement of scientific breakthroughs.
“People get excited about the bright, shiny things,” he said. “And, you know, sometimes they get distracted from the hard, blue-collar science that we’ve all got to do to really make sure that our results are reproducible and reliable, which is particularly important when it’s going to impact how I’m treated or you’re treated or anybody else.”

Visualization scientist Kimberly Kowal Arcand from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and collaborators from science-art outreach project SYSTEM Sounds created a new sonification technique that translates cosmic images into music.
The team’s goal was to develop a new strategy that would make space imaging more accessible to blind and visually impaired people. Through a process called data sonification, SYSTEM Sounds co-founders Matt P. Russo, Andrew Santaguida, and Dan Tamayo worked with NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory to convert space images into sound based on solar systems’ distinct features.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Arcand built 3D models that enabled the visually impaired to experience space images through their sense of touch. With all in-person programs halted this year, Arcand decided to collaborate with SYSTEM Sounds to create a new type of digitally accessible space image.
“I had some datasets that I was hoping to work on, and Matt and Andrew from SYSTEM Sounds are both complete pros about it,” Arcand said. “It was very, very easy to work with them, to communicate the type of information.”
Arcand added data sonification layers to the 2D images of space to create a multimodal experience that incorporated both visual and auditory fields.
Arcand and SYSTEM Sounds created the music by translating custom Python scripts and Logic Pro data into corresponding notes and rhythms. They initially generated an intensity map where the widest features of the 2D image were the most intense and the narrowest features were the least intense.
“It’s all about what is the essential feature of that system and what’s the most clear and interesting way to communicate that through sound,” Russo said.
The scientists then labeled each intensity level on the image with a specific musical instrument and then formulated the output into cohesive harmonies and rhythms designed to appeal to the ears.
“We wanted something that not only makes sense for the science but also sounds good,” Arcand said.
The translation of the cosmic images into music has yielded increased accessibility for people of all visual abilities. Robyn L. Rennie, an artist with low vision, said she was inspired when she first heard the music for Saturn’s rings after being unable to see the night sky for years.
“It really helped me to conceptualize in my mind what those images were,” Rennie said. “The show resonated with me because I do the same thing in my own art, using the alternative media to create an accessible show.”
Arcand and Russo said they were surprised by the positive response to the music they developed. SYSTEM Sounds plans to continue their collaboration with NASA to create the cosmic music.
“I was quite shocked, in the best way, at the sort of emotional response that I received from the data sonification,” Arcand said. “That was a really special moment for me, that it had an immediate impact.”

UPDATED: October 30, 2020, 4:01 p.m.
Experts discussed policy strategies to improve youth outcomes and combat gaps in educational resources in a Thursday virtual event hosted by the Local Children’s Cabinet Network, an advocacy body co-managed by the Education Redesign Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, the Children's Funding Project, and the Forum for Youth Investment.
The Network is composed of agencies both inside and outside government that convene across the country to share data, develop policies, and work toward the collective goal of improving the overall lives of youth.
Elizabeth Gaines, founder of the Children’s Funding Project and moderator of the webinar, said children’s cabinets are important foundations of a child’s support system.
“There are many different public agencies that touch the lives of children in their own ways,” she said in an interview prior to the event. “A children’s cabinet is a way for leaders in a community to bring those different systems together.”
Gaines listed an array of present-day challenges regarding childhood development and education, which she said have exposed long-standing inequalities.
“We’re talking not only about a pandemic, not only about a recession, not only about racial injustice, and now also about a climate crisis,” she said.
Paul Reville, the founder and director of the Education Redesign Lab and former secretary of education for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, posited that the urgency of these joint crises, however, could spur change.
Reville shared ideas on concrete action that can be taken to remedy the damage to childhood education resulting from COVID-19, specifically pointing to families as essential components of children’s support ecosystems.
“Families are really and truly at the center of the learning enterprise,” he explained. “We need new connective tissue, new people who do the work of hooking up with the school system and the families — people like AmeriCorps service members and the National Youth Service.”
Karen Pittman, co-founder of the Forum for Youth Investment, added that another key component of this ecosystem includes the relationships formed in school not just with educators, but with all staff who interact with children.
“I am really struggling with how hard it is to get educators to even acknowledge all the people connected to school. I mean the bus drivers, the cafeteria workers, the counselors, the security guards,” Pittman said.
Both Reville and Pittman also highlighted the importance of personalizing education as a means to move children along productive trajectories into adolescence. They said they hoped educators could design success plans that are specific to the needs of individual students.
“How do we build cradle-to-career systems of child development and education that give every child — and all means all — a chance to succeed?” Reville asked the audience to consider.
To support their claims, both speakers outlined specific examples of successful educational ecosystems. Pittman described the success of the Wallace Foundation Summer Learning Initiative in Pittsburgh, a public school project that tested out the integration of academic, social, and emotional skill development.
The project’s success with “coordinating horsepower” through partnership-building gave it a network with which to manage shocks to the system during the COVID-19 crisis, according to Pittman.
Despite the multi-faceted challenges of the current moment, the speakers ultimately expressed hope for the future of the education system.
“Disruption creates opportunity,” Pittman said. “Let’s acknowledge the disruption and let’s build forward together.”

A researcher at Harvard's School of Public Health teamed up with researchers at the Yale School of Public Health to develop a model for understanding and making projections about COVID-19 disease spread at a local level.
Updated daily with the newest available data, the model combines information on reported deaths, disease stage duration, and severity and mortality risk to estimate the spread of COVID-19 across all 50 states and more than 3,000 local counties.
Assistant Professor of Global Health Nicolas A. Menzies, the Harvard researcher involved in the project, worked with several Yale-affiliated researchers on building the model by developing its original statistical estimation.
As more data and new evidence become available, Menzies will also continue to oversee efforts to keep refining the model’s approach.
A perceived shortage of reliable data inspired the researchers to develop their own rigorous model, he said.
“In the US, it was clear that deficiencies in routinely reported data made it hard to make good planning decisions, so this project was an attempt to fill in the gaps,” Menzies wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Menzies said that the model’s local approach makes it unique among other COVID models.
“In our work we feel that a lot of individual and public decisions about COVID-19 require local estimates, and we are one of the only efforts providing these modelled results at county-level on a daily basis,” he wrote.
Users can download files containing all the local and state COVID data, a function born out of the researchers’ desires to make the data accessible. The researchers also attached a “covidestim R package” to the home page of the model so public health officials and other researchers can run the model using their own data.
The model comes as Massachusetts has seen a renewed uptick in COVID cases, reaching a positive case rate of 1.3 percent on Oct. 22. Cambridge’s positive case rate has stayed at only 0.13 percent as of Oct. 14.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School have discovered an increased persistence of certain protective antibodies in patients who survived increased severity cases of COVID-19.
The research — published in Science Immunology earlier this month — identified antibodies that persist in blood samples four months after COVID-19 infection.
Jason B. Harris, an associate professor of pediatrics at HMS and co-senior author of the study, said the antibodies the researchers observed are broadly classified into three types: IgA, IgM, and IgG. The researchers were especially excited to find that IgG — which often serves as a neutralizing antibody that can block the virus from entering a cell — showed signs of longevity.
“For a lot of viruses, neutralizing antibodies predict whether you are protected from future infection,” Harris said. “Because COVID-19 is a new infection we are still learning about, we were especially interested to know whether that infection resulted in long-lasting immune memory. The persistence of antibodies, specifically IgG, is a very encouraging sign that COVID-19 does induce long-lasting immunity.”
Harris also said having antibodies such as IgA and IgM that demonstrate shortened persistence can be helpful to clinicians to identify both whether or not a patient might have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as the timeline of infection.
“As a doctor, I see many people who want to know whether or not they have had COVID-19, even if it was in the past or recent past, because people might get sick but not know why they got sick,” Harris said. “Unless you’re testing them really early in the disease, PCR tests might not be as helpful in determining later on if someone was infected with COVID-19.”
Anita S. Iyer, a postdoctoral research fellow at HMS and first author on the study, said while the study provides promising findings, some questions still remain. The current study tracked antibody persistence over four months, follow-up studies will aim to track persistence over a year.
In addition, many of the blood samples within the study came from patients with severe COVID-19 infections who had been hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital. Iyer said researchers have yet to discover how antibody persistence might differ between severe and mild cases of infection.
“Since patients with asymptomatic or mild cases were able to mount resistance against infection, these patients must also have produced antibodies, right?” Iyer said. “However, we have yet to track more mild infections, and it is possible we might see a difference in persistence of antibodies produced in response to a mild infection compared to a severe infection.”
Richelle C. Charles, an assistant professor of medicine and co-senior author of the study, said while she believes patients with COVID-19 can develop immunity, scientists still do not know “exactly what the full protective immune response to COVID is.”
“I would say that neutralizing antibody titers is a protective response, but I would also want to look if there are other protective responses that might in addition be important in protection against subsequent infection,” Charles said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of Diving With a Purpose, a nonprofit dedicated to ocean conservation and maritime archaeology, spoke about their organization’s history, mission, and community outreach at a virtual panel event hosted by the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture Thursday night.
Albert José Jones and Jay Haigler, lead diving instructors, were the founding directors of Diving With a Purpose when it first became a nonprofit in 2004. DWP is an international organization made up of hundreds of divers.
“Our motto is restoring our oceans, preserving our heritage,” said Erik Denson, another lead instructor and the Chief Electrical Engineer at the NASA Kennedy Space Center.
Part of DWP's mission is to focus on increasing racial representation in the field of maritime archaeology.
“We have a special focus on the protection, documentation, and interpretation of African slave trade shipwrecks, and the maritime history and culture of African Americans, who formed a core labor and expertise for America’s — and even the global maritime enterprise,” Haigler said.
He emphasized how DWP also offers training and certification programs for both adults and students — the latter, he claimed, were often better than the former.
Ayana O. Flewellen, a diving instructor for DWP and anthropology professor at the University of California, Riverside, said the organization provides young people of color the opportunity to see themselves reflected in the archaeology profession.
“Less than 1 percent of archaeologists are folks of African descent here in North America,” Flewellen said. “So the work that they’re doing is really providing this space outside of academia that challenges the representation of what archaeology is, and who could be an archaeologist and how that person looks.”
In addition to documenting slave-ship wrecks, DWP has been involved in numerous missions, such as finding the remains of one of the Tuskegee Airmen’s planes that crashed during training in Lake Huron, Mich. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black aviators in the U.S. Army Air Corps.
Haigler spoke about the discovery of the plane’s wreckage and its call box, which was a particularly well-preserved artifact.
“Now this is an enlarged picture of the radio call number: 221226. The importance of that number is this: it’s like a signature. In the Army Air Force, when a pilot is assigned a plane, he is given a unique radio call number, and that radio call number belongs to that particular pilot,” he said. “When the radio call box was found, this was in pristine condition, as if Second Lieutenant Frank H. Moody's signature was on that radio call.”
In the Q&A session after the panel, Jones noted the sobering aspects of the organization’s work, particularly when divers uncovered artifacts from slave ships.

“The shackles that were made for children, I would say, is one of the artifacts that really, really gets to you,” Jones said. “It’s tough to do because it’s not like a job, not something you can train for, because it involves your heritage; you’re a part of this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Multiple peer counseling groups at the College have teamed up to provide virtual group support services for undergraduates this semester after discontinuing one-on-one sessions.
The groups developed and implemented revised services under the supervision of Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services. Last spring, CAMHS suspended peer counseling services after students were sent home mid-semester.
Peer counseling groups normally work closely with CAMHS supervisors to ensure they are providing “appropriate” care to students on campus, CAMHS chief Barbara Lewis wrote in an email in April.
Since groups cannot receive this supervision remotely, Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach co-directors Chloé L.M. Georgeaux-Healy ’22 and Marlena E. Skrabak ’22 said ECHO was required to discontinue its titular hotline service and one-on-one drop-in office hours this fall.
“We can’t do the same confidential individual counseling, but we still really deeply wanted to be able to connect,” Skrabak, a Crimson design editor, said.
To that end, they said ECHO will partner with peer counseling groups Response and Indigo to co-host group support sessions this semester. Skrabak said those sessions will consider the “overlap” between the three groups’ specializations.
“There is a lot of overlap. Your body doesn’t exist outside of your identity, and it doesn’t exist outside of your relationships,” she said. “It’s really ECHO, Response, and Indigo all in one.”
ECHO has also tailored its Body Talk Workshops — which foster student conversations about combating negative body talk and explore the concept of the “ideal Harvard student” — to an online group format. The workshops will also address new eating concerns brought on by the remote semester for students on and off campus, especially for first-years and athletes.
“What does it mean to go back home and eat at home again under parent supervision, or in your childhood home, or where you might have experienced past trauma with food and with body?” Georgeaux-Healy said. “What does it mean to be a first-year and have every single meal be a bagged meal and lose the social element of food?”
“For athletic teams, I know it’s just been a huge struggle in terms of not having practice anymore and having to deal with body changes and not working out on such a strict schedule,” she added.
Similarly, Contact — a peer counseling group focused on serving Harvard’s BGLTQ undergraduates — launched group counseling services last week after “revamping” its resource binder for students, according to director Alexandra R. Zaloga ’21.
The group sessions, devised by Contact and CAMHS, are each one hour long and held weekly on Friday afternoons.
“The counseling is the same as we would do in our typical one-on-one sessions, meaning that it’s non-directive, non-judgemental, confidential peer counseling just as you would see on campus, except now it’s in a group format on Zoom,” Zaloga said.
Peer counseling groups Indigo and Room 13 did not respond to requests for comment.
Skrabak said although confidentiality “doesn’t exist in the same capacity” for peer counseling sessions this semester because of the group format, the student counselors “set norms” for respecting all participants.
“Anything that happens stays in ECHO,” she said. “We take it really seriously.”
According to Skrabak, “several groups” have reached out to ECHO expressing interest in the Body Talk Workshops. She said she recognizes, though, that engagement may be “different” during a remote semester.
“As long as ECHO is serving at least one person and one person feels supported, I would be happy to be able to be doing that job,” Skrabak said.
“And not even really a job — a desire,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard professors discussed the evolving role of religion in the 2020 presidential election in a lecture hosted by the Divinity School Thursday.
Moderator Catherine A. Brekus ’85, a Divinity School professor who studies the history of religion in America, situated the conversation in a status quo moving to accommodate new religious trends, particularly the emergence of religious “nones,” or non-believers.
American History professor James T. Kloppenberg and Visiting Professor in Religion and Political Culture E. J. Dionne spoke about newly emerging trends of highly Christian populations expressing their disappointment with President Donald J. Trump, some even going as far as casting the ballot for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.
“Joe Biden might actually win not only the Latino Catholic vote by a large margin, but he may actually pull off a victory in the white Catholic vote,” Dionne said. “And I think that’s partly because of the same disillusionment with Trump that other groups are feeling.”
Dionne mentioned growing discontent among conservative Catholic and Christian voters with the president’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He cited John Carr, founder and director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life and Georgetown University when explaining this rationale.
Carr “made the point that if you are pro-life, it is not just about what happens before birth, it’s not just about what happens in the womb,” Dionne said. “I am hearing this language, which is traditionally liberal-Catholic, liberal-Christian language, now coming from an awful lot of more conservative, anti-Trump Christians.”
Brekus wrote in a statement to The Crimson after the event that pollsters are “inherently interested” in how white Catholics vote.
“Trump won their vote in 2016, but Biden himself is a white Catholic, and he is trying to win their vote (Hispanic and black Catholics support Biden by a large margin, so even if Biden doesn’t win white Catholics, he might win the “Catholic vote.”),” Brekus wrote.
Kloppenberg highlighted the longstanding role of religious pluralism in U.S. history, referencing the formation of American democracy itself.
“It’s important to acknowledge that the divisions that E.J. talked about have been present in America since before there was a United States,” he said. “Americans had to learn to live with diversity, and that diversity carried over into the new nation. And so seeing the divisions that we see across liberal and conservative blocks is nothing new.”
Both professors discussed how the Trump administration has evolved the role of religion in American politics, first referencing the legacy of former President Barack Obama and his efforts to embrace religious pluralism.
“Obama both personally embodied that sense of being different from the presidents who had come before him and the welcoming sense that there was something precious about the American tradition of welcoming difference and embracing difference,” Kloppenberg said. “And so I think the signals he was sending out to the world are as antithetical to the signals that we’ve gotten from the Trump White House as it's possible to imagine.”
Dionne said that Trump uses religion in a more “aggressive” manner than Obama.
“Now, what you’ve got with Trump,” Dionne said afterward, “is weaponizing religion in a very aggressive way.”
Brekus wrote in a statement after the event that Trump’s efforts to prioritize the voices of white evangelicals contrasts the religious pluralism that has defined American democracy.
“Trump’s greatest effect on religion has been to privilege the voices of white evangelicals, who have supported him in huge numbers because of their hope that he will restore something that they feel has been lost—namely, the white, Protestant identity of the United States,” Brekus wrote. “In contrast, both Jim Kloppenberg and E.J. Dionne noted that religious pluralism has strengthened American democracy.”

Roughly a third of Harvard undergraduates strongly or somewhat strongly favor proposals to abolish or defund the Harvard University Police Department, according to a September survey conducted by The Crimson.
An investigation published by The Crimson in January found a pattern of racism and sexism within the department. The investigation prompted HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley to launch an internal review into the department. Less than a month after the review’s launch, the department reckoned with fresh criticism over allegations of police brutality leveled against one of its officers, Anthony T. Carvello.
The University also launched an independent review of HUPD after its officers drew criticism for their presence at a June protest following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police in May.
Of 877 undergraduates who filled out The Crimson’s 2020 College Survey, 35 percent favored proposals to abolish or defund HUPD, while 46.8 percent strongly or somewhat disfavored such a proposition.
Eighty-five percent of respondents who identified as very conservative reported viewing abolishing or defunding HUPD as strongly unfavorable, while 40.9 percent of very liberal respondents viewed the proposals as strongly favorable.
Nearly a quarter of respondents indicated that they attended protests against police brutality and systemic racism this summer following Floyd’s murder. While 40.5 percent of students who attended these protests indicated that they strongly favored proposals to abolish or defund HUPD, only 10 percent of students who did not attend the protests felt similarly.
A majority of respondents indicated that they support proposals for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels and companies tied to private prisons.
Divesting from fossil fuels garnered strongly or somewhat favorable views from 73.4 percent of respondents. Divesting from companies linked to private prisons won a similarly large margin of support, eliciting strongly or somewhat favorable opinions from 73.5 percent of respondents.
Opinions on divestment were split along political lines, however. Though 96.2 percent of those who indicated they are very liberal also hold favorable views of fossil fuel divestment, 75 percent of very conservative respondents view fossil fuel divestment as unfavorable. Similarly, 94.6 percent of very liberal respondents have favorable views of prison divestment, compared to the 60 percent of very conservative respondents who deem prison divestment strongly unfavorable.
On another contentious campus issue — social group sanctions — 41.2 percent of respondents reported that they strongly or somewhat favored Harvard’s decision to drop its policy penalizing students who join single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. In contrast, 31 percent of students said they viewed the move strongly or somewhat unfavorably.
University administrators drew mixed reviews from students.
Nearly 50 percent of respondents reported viewing University President Lawrence S. Bacow strongly or somewhat favorably, while 27.5 percent view him strongly or somewhat unfavorably.
Respondents held relatively neutral views about Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh and University Provost Alan M. Garber, with 51.5 percent viewing Claybaugh neither favorably nor unfavorably and 57.6 percent viewing Garber neither favorably nor unfavorably.
Most respondents indicated positive views of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, with 62.4 percent viewing him strongly or somewhat favorably and 18.4 percent viewing him strongly or somewhat unfavorably.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the beginning of the move into the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston less than two weeks away, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III confirmed progress is on-track and discussed “silver linings” of the current move-in timeline in an interview Thursday.
The SEC obtained its Certificate of Occupancy in September. Phased move-in will begin the first week of November and will stretch into February 2021, with the complex slated to open to undergraduate students for the 2021-2022 academic year.
SEAS faculty are currently in the process of packing up their belongings and equipment, according to Doyle. His own Dean’s office, for instance, is already prepared for the move.
“I have already gone back to Oxford Street. I have boxed up and packed the Dean’s office,” Doyle said. “Forty boxes later and a little bit of a sore back, that office was all wrapped up. And now I will unwrap those 40 packed boxes the second week of November.”
While his own move-in process will be relatively straightforward, moving certain pieces of scientific equipment to the SEC — including the Mark I computer that used to sit in the lobby of the Science Center — may prove more complicated, according to Doyle. He added that SEAS will adhere closely to public health and social distancing guidelines throughout the move-in, which may slow down the process.
“We have to be a little more thoughtful about timing the moves. Pre-COVID, we would have just said, ‘Let’s avoid traffic jams in the hallways.’ Now, we’ve got to maintain social distancing, density in the building, things like that,” Doyle said.
But the slower move-in timeline in place comes with benefits, according to Doyle. In particular, SEAS has been able to take its time through the transition and work on fine-tuning details, including the shuttle system that will connect the Quad to Allston as well as dining options for students.
“I’m a big believer in the silver lining; I’m a ‘glass is half-full’ kind of guy. So, having a little more time to be methodical and thoughtful, as opposed to what otherwise would have been a carefully choreographed, but a rather intense schedule over the summer, is now going to be drawn out over the year,” Doyle said. “And that, to me, is a silver lining.”
Doyle also noted the overall efficiency with which progress on the SEC was able to resume at the beginning of the summer after pausing in mid-March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
“If anything, I have been positively impressed at how quickly the University and the contractors rebooted the process, got things back on track when we shut down all things — research, teaching, and the building construction — back in the spring,” Doyle said. “I thought it could be a very long, protracted shutdown, but in fact they did reboot relatively quickly.”
Though the “serendipitous collisions” between SEAS affiliates that the SEC was designed to foster may be limited due to the pandemic, Doyle said SEAS still hopes the building attracts visitors while adhering to COVID-19 regulations.
“That was the idea — to really get people bumping into each other. And now in COVID times, that's a very bad idea,” Doyle said. “But we also wanted traffic coming through the lobby, we wanted visitors from the Allston community, we wanted visitors from the Harvard community to flow through the lobby of the building. So we are planning a number of displays. There's some very interesting dynamic artwork in the lobby that will draw our community, but we’re going to do this under the safety COVID protocols for now.”
In addition to its impacts on physical access to the SEC, COVID-19 has also disrupted research, limiting lab occupancy and undergraduate students’ ability to join research teams. Currently, only registered seniors are able to conduct in-person research in SEAS laboratories, which are still operating at 50 percent density, per local mandates.
Doyle said he is working in his capacity as SEAS dean to safely re-open labs to more undergraduate students.
“We're having conversations with the College, trying to loosen some of those restrictions in the future, but a lot of that depends on decisions the College and the FAS are going to make about the spring semester,” Doyle said.
Despite these restrictions, Doyle said SEAS affiliates can still maximize their research experiences by utilizing rotating shifts in the lab while maintaining 50 percent density. Registered underclassmen are also eligible to conduct remote research with faculty.
“If you use seven days of the week, if you play the shifts, those who are hungry and eager to get into labs can actually — even with a 50 percent rule — get very close to full productivity,” Doyle said.
