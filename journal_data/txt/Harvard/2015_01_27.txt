After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Harvard freshman receives “The Unofficial Guide: Your College Bucket List,” a little red and black book detailing the top 100 activities every college student should attempt. Although many detail storied traditions (“celebrating” on the John Harvard statue or running naked around the Yard before finals), the 31st recommendation is a little different: “Date Someone: It’s harder than you think.” As the opening line quips: “You might think you have four years to find your soul mate at Harvard. You don’t. You have exactly one week: It was at Orientation, and if you didn’t fall in love then, you never will.” The writers are joking, but the analogy that “dating at Harvard is just about as common as getting C’s” does not always seem far from the truth. A recent Crimson survey found that one in five undergraduates never dates during college here. Having a consistent, labeled relationship is not for everyone. But if, as some recent reports have suggested, the alternative hookup scene leaves many “deeply dissatisfied,” why don’t more people date?
According to Dr. Lisa Wade, a sociological professor at Occidental College who spoke at Harvard’s first Sex Week, students look for pleasure, connection, and empowerment in their sexual and relationship-based pursuits. So many don’t date because it’s unnecessary: They can find these qualities in the low-commitment, much-discussed hookup culture. It’s easier to stimulate short attention spans, and the lack of commitment means less time and emotional investment. We’re young, we’re smart. Why waste time building a relationship when we can get what we need (or at least finish stat homework on time) without the untidiness of feeling?
Moreover, social avoidance and compartmentalization are a part of the campus culture. The demands of psets, clubs, sports, and friends do not always allow for extra time in the murky world of dating. Committing to a single person is also giving up the opportunity to speak or interact with others—our beloved networking is lost when we dedicate ourselves to only one pursuit. In addition, most Harvard students wouldn’t be here if they hadn’t learned what it meant to prioritize studies or extracurricular commitments over relationships. When you’ve spent your entire life winning robotics contests and swimming competitions, why would you risk rejection—or even distraction—in another person?
Choosing to make our academic and social lives mutually exclusive may be the simplest path, but is it the one we should choose? As a Crimson writer lamented in 2010, “Everyone here puts their work first, believing that in the long run, an on-time Gov 20 paper will be more beneficial than a potentially-awkward date with last Saturday’s hook-up.” The key word is “potential.” Although it sometimes seems like there just aren’t enough hours in the day or storage in our hearts for the uncertainty of pursuing and caring for someone else, we may lose out on promising possibilities when we refuse to take the risk of putting ourselves out there. And if the date fails, how bad, really, is the resulting “awkwardness” or a week’s worth of lost pride, especially in comparison with what we stand to gain?
Many of the reasons for not dating in college reflect a tendency to see a relationship as a zero-sum game, but much like the time spent with friends or even napping detracts from our work, these “distractions” also serve as necessary “recharge” activities. No one can work all day without some detriment to their health and even their academic progress. Because relationships are the most common cause of our strongest positive emotions, they can provide a truer, fuller experience despite any accompanying uncertainty.
It is said that the most valuable experiences at Harvard often take place not in the classrooms learning from venerated professors but from time spent with peers. Casual friendships are easier to come by, but relationships can offer deep emotional support and experience. Refusing to take that risk because of scheduling or potential failure is to forget how this time spent can benefit our mental health and even academic performance. Consider again Wade’s words about what most look for in their time at this school: Pleasure, connection, and empowerment. With any well-established norm, it’s worthwhile to periodically consider if our current actions are achieving that goal. For dating on this campus, breaking the Harvard mold may be worth it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an early Thursday morning on January 15, I received a phone call from my father, who was supposed to be working in Boston as a fire lieutenant. I quickly learned that he couldn’t drive to work that morning because Interstate 93 (Massachusetts’ main expressway into Boston) had been “turned into a parking lot.” A handful of protestors affiliated with the activist group Black Lives Matter had chained themselves inside of 55-gallon barrels that were filled with concrete, blocking the expressway in protest. I could not believe what I was hearing.
Traffic backed up for hours until the protestors were cut free by emergency responders. Until then, many simply had to wait in a standstill, leaving most commuters extremely late to work. An ambulance carrying a trauma patient headed to Boston Medical Center even had to be diverted to a local hospital that lacked a trauma center due to the backup.  This winter, protests swept the nation mainly in response to the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The phrase “Black Lives Matter” became commonplace, and many demonstrations took place by Harvard students and throughout Cambridge. But there is a difference between a protest that has the right cause and a protest that, regardless of the legitimacy of its cause, has the right implementation. What happened on the I-93 certainly lacked the latter characteristic. That is not the way to protest.
While the 1-93 protest certainly gained publicity, it was wrong for protestors to block a busy highway during the heart of a morning commute. While some might argue that it only caused minor, negligible inconveniences in comparison to the cause, I disagree.
First, the initial moments when the protestors hopped onto a busy highway could easily have created a pileup during the early morning commute. Not only would this have been a major inconvenience, but any resulting injuries could have put lives in danger—a rather self-defeating result from an attempt to protest a loss of lives. Second, creating a diversion of the city’s emergency responders is irresponsible. It is costly, and what's more the pure time that fire trucks, police cars, and ambulances had to stay on the scene took away from their availability elsewhere. In emergency response situations, every minute counts, and the protestor’s actions could easily have made the difference between life and death.
Finally, and most importantly, the forced ambulance diversion demonstrates exactly why our society has certain structures that protestors should think twice about before disrupting. Richard McGrath luckily survived his single car crash with only a fractured neck and broken ribs, but if he had died, a new tragedy would have arisen. If McGrath had not been able to access the level one trauma center at Boston Medical Center in time, the protestors would have held the blame. Again, it would have been inexplicable, tragic, and hypocritical to have caused an unneeded death by protesting unneeded deaths.
29 arrests were made that day, and rightfully so. There are times and places to protest, and there are times and places in which it should certainly not be allowed. We all came out of that Thursday with only enraged commuters and irritated emergency responders, but if something like this were to happen again on an equal or perhaps an even higher scale, we may not be so lucky.
No matter how genuine the cause, protests simply cannot happen without reflective planning. Protests like the one on I-93 only polarize the very people they are trying to recruit, and bring well-warranted backlash on the protestors themselves, instead of the causes they support.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A college education is becoming increasingly essential in the modern-day economy. While many jobs do not require a college degree or certificate, studies show that educational attainment correlates directly with higher earnings and lower unemployment rates. According to one study by Georgetown University, by 2018 two-thirds of all jobs will require at least some postsecondary training. In short, a high school diploma is simply not enough anymore, as today’s economy calls for workers with skills and training that require at least 14, not 12, years of formal education. A college education was once an added benefit; now it is a prerequisite.
Given the growing importance of higher education, President Obama’s call to eliminate community college tuition across the country is laudable. As two-year institutions that open access to postsecondary education, serve as a pathway to a four-year degree, and provide workforce development and skills training, community colleges are an essential component of the American education system. In particular, they offer traditionally underrepresented communities such as minority, low-income, and first-generation students a chance to pursue a college education.
For many of these students, tuition is a barrier to pursuing higher education, as the demands of term-time employment and other expenses interfere with school. Fortunately, programs like the President’s plan have had success in keeping students in school and in improving the high dropout rates at community colleges. One pilot program in New York City that the President cited in making his proposal led to a significant increase in graduation rates, with 57 percent of enrollees graduating in three years–an increase of 41 percent from the current 16 percent rate.  If implemented, Obama’s plan could save students an average of $3,800 annually, no small sum for students struggling to pay for their education. In addition to saving students money and improving graduation rates, the Obama plan would also improve the employment prospects of students. In short, Obama’s proposal could take away the financial barrier that keeps many students from pursuing education beyond high school, and ensure that those students see the fruits of their educational labors.
Like all political creations, the Obama proposal is not perfect. New York City’s pilot program, for instance, provided funding for textbooks and commuting as well as tuition, costs that the President’s plan omits. Eligible low-income students will be able to use Pell Grant money to pay for those expenses, but they may still be left with significant sums to produce on their own. Moreover, the President’s proposal is not likely to pass a Republican Congress; despite its resemblance to an already implemented plan in Tennessee, Speaker of the House John Boehner and Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee have signaled their opposition.
Despite these flaws, however, President Obama’s plan has crucial symbolic significance, and has raised the subject of community college into the national spotlight, where it belongs. By directing the national conversation to community colleges, President Obama is taking a bold step in the direction of reforming American public education. In the State of the Union, the President said that community college should be “as free and universal in America as high school is today.” As Harvard students, we can only support such a vision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2015, at 8:49 p.m.
Harvard will suspend all operations Tuesday for non-critical personnel in anticipation of a looming blizzard that may bring more than two feet of snow to the Boston area.
As snow began to fall Monday in advance of a storm that the National Weather Service has called “crippling and potentially historic,” individual schools geared up to close. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has canceled all Tuesday courses and sections, according to an emergency email communication sent to FAS affiliates early Monday afternoon. Harvard Extension School canceled classes Monday night and Tuesday. Graduate schools, including Harvard Law School, the Graduate School of Design, and the Graduate School of Education, also canceled classes.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris told undergraduates in an email that the College’s deadline for submitting course study cards on Friday will not change in light of the blizzard, which interrupts course shopping week. Harris instructed students concerned about meeting the deadline to contact the deans in their Houses or freshman yards.
In advance of the storm, the weather service issued a blizzard warning from 7 p.m. Monday to 1 a.m. Wednesday, cautioning that travel would be “impossible and life threatening” during this time. In Massachusetts on Monday, Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 declared a state of emergency for the state, banning all non-essential motor vehicle travel, effective at midnight. The MBTA will also be closed Tuesday.
At Harvard, FAS Libraries, including Widener and Lamont, will close at 10 p.m. Monday, the first day of the spring term, and stay closed Tuesday, and Harvard University Health Services has canceled regular Tuesday appointments but will remain open for urgent care, according to an email to undergraduates from Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. University transit and fleet services will operate fully until 12 a.m. Tuesday, according to Carl A. Tempesta, associate director of transit, fleet, and charter services. Transit staff will “[assess] the storm as well as the conditions of the streets” and “will pull the vehicles” once streets become unsafe, he said.
Dining halls, meanwhile, will function at normal hours Tuesday, although menus will be modified slightly, with no grill options at lunch and dinner, altered entrees, and extra soups, according to Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin. Martin wrote in an email that Harvard will house HUDS staff and managers on or near campus Monday evening and that dining halls will feed grounds staff who clear snow.
The impending storm spurred a number of event cancellations on campus and in Boston. Memorial Church canceled its mornings prayer services for Tuesday and Wednesday, and two exhibitions of plans for the Smith Campus Center, scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, will now occur next week.
Declaring a snow emergency, the City of Cambridge enacted a parking ban at 4 p.m. Boston’s Logan Airport will cancel domestic flights as early as 7:30 p.m., according to The Boston Globe, and Boston Public Schools will close Tuesday and Wednesday.
Historically, Harvard has only closed for a select few major weather events. In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world,” although the University closed for the blizzard of 1978. More recently, 2012’s Hurricane Sandy and 2013’s winter storm “Nemo” prompted the University to close.
Monday, as administrators busily prepared for the University’s upcoming closure and Massachusetts’s state of emergency, undergraduates readied plans for snowball fights across campus.
Dorm Crew’s incoming supervisor, Paul L. Belmonte ’10, said the cleaning crew will provide shovels for students who want to assist with paid campus snow removal.

HarvardX for Alumni, a program that offers online course content specifically to University alumni, drew 25,000 registrants in its first iteration last March, thousands more than initially expected, but received mixed responses from those who enrolled.
The initiative is a partnership between the Harvard Alumni Association and HarvardX, the University’s branch of the online learning platform edX. Philip W. Lovejoy, executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, said that he anticipated only a few thousand to enroll when the program began last spring.
“When we launched the program, I was sort of thinking that if we had ten thousand registrants, we’d do really well,” said Lovejoy. “We actually ended up at close to 25,000 alumni, including their guests.”
Lovejoy said that he considered the registration number extraordinarily successful in comparison to other alumni programs, adding that he could not think of a single other program for Harvard alumni with the same level of participation.
Despite the high number of registrations, alumni responses to the quality of the program were mixed.
Robert A. Lue, faculty director of HarvardX who first conceived of the alumni-specific program, said that reviews were split half and half between those who enjoyed the course and those who did not. For instance, some participants wanted more from the modular content, which combined smaller segments from a variety of courses rather than representing a single course.
“Our alumni had a diversity of what they were hoping for from the experience,” Lue said. “I think what some of them didn’t realize is that you can go and take the full course if you wanted to,” he said, referring to HarvardX course offerings on edX, an open courseware venture first founded by Harvard and MIT in May 2012.
Lovejoy said that the complexity of registration might also have contributed to negative reviews. Users first had to register through a Harvard alumni community portal and then complete a separate edX registration, he said. According to Lovejoy, slightly more than 10,000 people finally registered and activated their enrollment on edX, less than half of the initial 25,000 who registered on the University’s alumni website.
In addition, some alumni found the edX platform challenging to navigate, Lue said.
“We spent more time than expected helping our alumni figure out how to take a course online,” Lue said. “Not only do they have a variety of aspirations, [the alumni] have a variety of levels of comfort and experience with using the internet.”
Despite technical issues, Lovejoy said that alumni reported in post-program surveys that they gained a better understanding of the edX and HarvardX experience and felt more connected to Harvard. In that sense, the opportunity for alumni to hear from faculty firsthand about how online learning can transform teaching in the classroom made the program a very successful experience, he added.
According to Lue, HarvardX and HAA are collaborating on the next iteration of HarvardX for Alumni. That process will include both the planning of a new set of modular courseware as well as a strategy to reconcile the diverse interests of those who prefer the modular format with those who want a full course.
Lue said that he also hopes future iterations of HarvardX for Alumni can continue to reconnect the University and its graduates in new ways.
“The goal is to connect not just with Harvard content, but with Harvard,” Lue said.

A new 24-hour CVS store at 6 JFK St. is projected to open in early April in the heart of Harvard Square in the space previously occupied by Citizens Bank. The new location will replace an existing CVS across the street.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that she was excited about the new store because of the business that the new central location—directly across from the Harvard Square MBTA stop—and longer hours would bring. The CVS location that will be closing, which is located at 29 JFK St., is only open 14 hours each day.
Jillson said she did not know whether the current 24-hour CVS location on Massachusetts Avenue, located a little more than 300 feet away from the new CVS location, would continue to operate on its normal schedule.
Construction is currently underway at 6 JFK St. with an anticipated April opening.
CVS employees declined to comment on the record, and public relations representatives of the company did not respond to requests for comment.

UPDATED: January 26, 2015, at 7:19 p.m.
Matriculated Harvard undergraduates can request and view the notes and comments penned by admissions officers on their applications because of a 1974 Department of Education act that holds that the documents must be accessible under federal law, according to Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70-’73.
McGrath wrote in an email last Tuesday that Harvard’s practice "has long been to furnish [summary sheets] for an enrolled student's review upon request.” Students who submit requests including their name, date of birth, and House may read the sheets, which contain comments from admissions officers as well as other demographic information, in the Admissions Office within 45 calendar days. Only students who have matriculated at Harvard are eligible to request their documents, McGrath wrote.
“[The summary sheets] include an awful lot of information about students’ background, their test scores, their high school information, and notes from the readers,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke said.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, or FERPA, has attracted attention in the media in recent weeks after The New York Times reported that an anonymous group of Stanford students had invoked it to successfully access copies of their records from the university, including written assessments and numerical scores assigned to them by admissions officers.
The group, which produces a newsletter called the Fountain Hopper, published its method online for requesting academic records, prompting students nationwide to also appeal for their files.
At Harvard, the summary sheets can only be read by appointment with McGrath or her assistant at the Admissions Office. The bulk of a student’s educational record—including test scores, transcripts, and letters of recommendation—is housed at the Registrar’s Office and at the House Offices and is accessible under FERPA.
“This is nothing new; the law has been on the books since 1974,” Burke said. “What we try to do is, because student information is stored in such a vast array of places, we try to say, ‘What is it that they are looking for?’ And then we try to find that.”
Although publicity surrounding the Fountain Hopper has only recently arisen, colleges have long been prepared for FERPA appeals, according to Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at the University of Virginia.
“Schools have been aware of FERPA laws for a long time, and as a result of that, a lot of schools would purge their paper files,” he said. “With electronic files, it’s a little more complicated than that. But I think that every school that hasn’t updated its technology to purge stuff will be doing it now.”
Burke said that Harvard now maintains its applicant files for four years after they are processed. A 1991 Department of Education ruling, following a complaint by former Crimson editor Joshua A. Gerstein '91, mandated that the Admissions Office release student summary sheets. The Admissions Office did allow some students to view their documents but said that others had already been destroyed.
Muth said that students are unlikely to find major revelations in their files.
“99.9 percent of the applications for students who are getting in are going to be saying good things,” he said. “Admissions officers are candid, but they’re not snarky. I think it’s pretty unlikely that you’re going to find almost any negative comments.”

With an anticipated snowfall of more than two feet looming over the Boston area, local Cambridge homeless shelters are working to extend their resources to accommodate as much of the area’s homeless population as possible throughout the period of severe weather.
According to Nicky N. Guerreiro ’16,  administrative director of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, the shelter stays open all day when the City of Cambridge has declared a snow emergency, as the city did Monday. “Guests from the previous night may stay until the evening, and new guests may come in earlier than our usual opening time of 7 p.m.,” she wrote in an emailed statement on behalf of the shelter.
Other shelters throughout Cambridge are taking precautionary steps as well. Although the Salvation Army located in Central Square is at capacity every night during the winter, Lt. Michael Harper said the shelter will not turn anyone away during the snowstorm, which the National Weather Service has called “crippling and potentially historic.”
Harvard has decided to suspend operations for all non-critical employees Tuesday, canceling classes and a number of events in anticipation of the blizzard.
“Once all [Salvation Army’s] beds are full, we’ll open our drop-in center with table and chairs to give people at least a warm place to stay for the night,” Harper said. “Our typical capacity is 36 beds, but on weather like tonight we can probably accommodate closer to 130 to 140 people.”
The Cambridge Police Department, meanwhile, will coordinate with area shelters to ensure the safety of Cambridge’s homeless population, facilitating “proper transportation if needed,” according to Jeremy Warnick, a CPD spokesperson.
Members of Harvard Square’s homeless population prepared for the increasingly inclement weather Monday. “There’s a few [homeless people] that I wonder where they’ll go, so I hope they go somewhere. It’d be tough to be outside in this,” Harper said.
Some preferred to brave the winter weather rather than stay in a shelter. Don, a 65-year-old man who usually panhandles in the Square and declined to give his last name, said he has had experience with sleeping out in the cold. Don has taken what precautions he can for the coming blizzard, such as acquiring warm clothes, a sleeping bag, and a propane stove, as well as choosing a strategic spot to sleep. He said he personally believes that sleeping outside is safer than sleeping in a shelter.
“A former friend of mine and I camped out once… when actual temperatures were below 20 degrees for three days in a row and we had snow on top of that,” he said.
“You basically just have to think on your feet,” Don said. “You just gotta depend on yourself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of course shopping week was disrupted by the cancellation of all Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday courses and sections in anticipation of a “potentially historic” snowstorm. Despite the interruption, Friday’s study card deadline will not be extended, and while some undergraduates said Monday that they appreciated the day off, others worried about the more limited time to determine their course schedules.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris told College students in an email Monday afternoon that the study card deadline would not be postponed, acknowledging the challenges the week’s scheduling disruptions might create.
“[W]e are mindful that this deadline may present you with difficulties, especially if you were thinking of enrolling in a course that meets on Tuesday only,” Harris wrote in the campus-wide email.
In a separate email to The Crimson, Harris wrote that the deadline will not be adjusted because of campus-wide, logistical plans.
“We are keeping the listed deadline because there is a good deal of work that needs to be done over the weekend to adjust section sizes, rooms assignment, etc.,” Harris wrote. “If we waited until after next Tuesday we run the risk of delaying section meetings for a week, processing TF appointments, and getting courses into the right rooms.”
Without sampling Tuesday courses, some students raised concerns about how they will work out the details of their academic semester.
“My whole Tuesday-Thursday schedule is thrown off,” Nyamekye E. Coleman ’17 said.
Kevin H. Xiong ’17 echoed Coleman’s sentiment, saying that he will not be able to shop overlapping courses.
“I was planning on splitting up my schedule by shopping one course on Tuesday and a course that met at the same time on Thursday,” Xiong said.
Students who plan to enroll in cross-registered courses face an additional burden since Harvard’s other schools do not have the same shopping week structure as the College, prompting some to worry about staying on top of course material.
“It feels harder to catch up because we’re already well into the course reading,” said Caitlyn E. Hayes ’15, who is shopping several classes outside the College. Hayes said that she hopes the Registrar extends shopping week because she wants to attend a cross-listed course which meets only on Tuesdays.
Other students, however, are pleased by the snow day and the free time they have gained.
“It just gives us an extra day to ease back into things,” Claudine S. Cho ’15 said. “It’s senior spring for me, so it’s not too big of a problem.”
Since many classes already have sections set, Tasnim Ahmed ’17 said that her shopping week plans will not change too much.
“I think most people are happy with the day off and are not too concerned,” she said.
Harris told The Crimson that students should not fret about the study card deadline. “We want students to take the time to pick the classes that interest them the most,” he wrote. “If they are interested in any Tuesday-only class they should feel no pressure to enroll in something else. Their Resident or House Dean can guide them.”

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office has compiled a Tumblr blog to serve as a running list of classes that are canceled or rescheduled due to the University’s suspension of operations in response to a snowstorm that the National Weather Service has called “potentially historic.”
According to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke, the website will be updated as professors notify the office whether they will hold their courses on Wednesday. He said that “it’s important that students know that [the website is] a resource.”
“We expect that there are going to be some faculty members who can’t make it in,” Burke said. “That’s why we are planning to spread the word as much as we can.”
In light of the decision that the course study card deadline, scheduled for Friday afternoon, would not be postponed despite the interruption to shopping week, Burke reiterated that students concerned about missing Tuesday-only classes should talk with their advisers and deans.
“It’s an unfortunate disruption; obviously there’s not much we can do,” he said. “If the University were to close on Wednesday, we’re obviously going to reevaluate our situation.”
To that end, administrators will hold conference calls and monitor the weather throughout the day Tuesday, according to Burke. All course updates and new information will be posted on the Tumblr page, but he suggested that students also check in with course iSites and Canvas course websites.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last 10 years, three Harvard men’s ice hockey players have scored more than 15 goals in a season. Alex Killorn ’12 netted 23 in 2011-2012. Dan Murphy ’06 had 18 in 2005-2006. And junior forward Jimmy Vesey has 17 in 2014-2015.
The biggest difference between Vesey and the graduates? Killorn and Murphy did it in 34 games. Vesey has accomplished it in 18.
Midway through his third season, Vesey has already posted MVP-level totals. At No. 15/13 Colgate on Saturday, the first-line left wing netted two highlight reel goals and added a pair of assists to move into the NCAA Division I lead in both goals (0.94) and points (1.67) per game.
Throughout a difficult winter recess in which the No. 4/4 Crimson struggled with injuries, Vesey was a beacon of consistency. He scored three or more points in each of Harvard’s three wins, and he scored the team’s first—occasionally, only—goal in each of the team’s three losses.
With the help of a postgame stat correction following Harvard’s 5-1 loss to St. Lawrence last week, Vesey is the only Division I player this year to register at least one point in each of his team’s games. His 18-game streak is tops in the nation.
Vesey sees the flashy offensive stats as a reward for individual and team-wide hard work. Over the summer, he spent extra time in the weight room, trimming fat and adding muscle. This season, he has skated alongside junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo and sophomore centers Alex Kerfoot and Tyler Moy—a formidable cast of playmakers who are also having career years.
Vesey’s impact extends the full 200 feet of the rink and beyond. He has improved in his defensive game and has become an important part of the Harvard penalty kill. Off the ice, the upperclassman has stepped up as a team leader.
“He’s been great for us all season, and certainly led us tonight, I think, not only on the ice but also in spirit,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said Saturday. “I thought he was really positive on the bench and really competitive. We certainly needed that kind of effort from him.”
A shot at the big league may be coming sooner rather than later for Vesey, who has launched himself into this year’s Hobey Baker discussion alongside Boston University freshman forward Jack Eichel, a projected top-two overall pick in this summer’s National Hockey League entry draft.
Vesey, a 66th overall pick himself via the Nashville Predators, recognizes his recent strides toward becoming a more complete professional prospect.
“I’m not just a one-dimensional, offensive player,” Vesey said. “I’m playing in all situations…. I think I’ve kind of developed into more of a pro-style player this year.”
On Saturday, Vesey looked like a pro among amateurs. His first strike was a goal-scorer’s goal—a top-shelf finish off a rink-length rush. His second goal was video game-like in quality, as the junior duked and weaved through the Colgate defense before sneaking one past the left glove of sophomore goaltender Charlie Finn.
It is far from certain whether this season will be Vesey’s last in a Harvard uniform. The Charlestown, Mass. native believes his game still has “a little ways to go” before he would feel comfortable signing away his NCAA eligibility, and he has a number of team-related goals on his to-do list, like bringing a Beanpot title back to Cambridge for the first time since 1993.
With star players like junior defenseman Patrick McNally and sophomore center Sean Malone sidelined, the Crimson will be counting on Vesey more than ever to deliver, and his recent play suggests that he is up to the challenge. NHL aspirations aside, Vesey is focused on the present, and enjoying the journey.
“I think that at the end of the year, I’ll see where I am,” Vesey said. ”But I feel good about where I’m going.”

With forecasters predicting that the Boston area will be obliterated with up to 3 feet of snow this, starting now and lasting through early into Wednesday, administrators all over Massachusetts are preparing for the end of the world. The national weather service issued a blizzard warning from this evening through Wednesday, Massachusetts governor Charles D. Baker ’79 declared a state of emergency, and Harvard’s very own executive vice president for snow Katie Lapp sent an email alerting us that the University “will suspend all but core operations” this Tuesday.
School’s cancelled wooh!!! A special congratulations to all those Californians who will finally learn the joys of a snow day. However, Harvard students clearly earned this much needed break. After an awesome first day of shopping period—waking up, coming to class, taking notes—a day off! For those of you in the quad, think about taking two days off for the roads to clear. Remember you can never watch too much Netflix.
