After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martha Minow, a long-time Harvard Law School professor, will become
the school’s next Dean on July 1, University President Drew G. Faust announced
Thursday, ending a secretive search process to replace former Dean Elena Kagan.



In the last few weeks of the search, Minow emerged as a top contender along
with acting Dean Howell E. Jackson and Professors John F.
Manning ’82 and David Wilkins ’77, according to individuals on the
faculty familiar with the search. Faust made the final selection.



Minow’s candidacy was boosted by her central role in the Law
School’s curricular reform process, a key element of Kagan’s legacy.
Minow's experience there made her the preferred choice of some on
the faculty, who said the curricular reform would require further
attention from the next dean if it was to become a lasting part of the
student experience. Those reforms are seen as one of the key
reasons for rising student happiness at a school that a few years ago
was all too well known for its neglect of student life.

But while Kagan's deanship was marked by expansion, the beginning of Minnow's tenure is almost certain to reflect the opposite.

She will start her job shortly after the University asked the Law School to
cut 10 percent from its operating budget in order to cope with a precipitous
fall in Harvard's endowment. And though much of the budget for the
coming fiscal year will have been written by Jackson, the acting dean,
tough economic times are likely to continue, and Harvard has said
support from the endowment will fall still further in the following
fiscal year.


That will mean hard choices for Minow, who now takes on the task of determining where to slash.

This responsibility falls on the shoulders of a professor with
little experience managing large budgets, said several faculty members
at the Law School who worry about Minow’s ability to quickly assess and cope with the
school’s financial situation. Though she has spent nearly three decades at the
school, Minow has had few major budgetary responsibilities during her time there.

One faculty member, who requested anonymity to preserve their relationship with the incoming dean, said that Minow's critics say she is not sufficiently able to “say no”—a dangerous quality at a time when hard
decisions will have to be made about what programs will be downsized or cut. 

But the same faculty member said Minow in many ways resembles
Kagan when she ascended to the Deanship—exhibiting a disregard for political
ideology, an interest in others’ work, and a deep concern for the Law School.

Minow inherits a different set of circumstances, however, than Kagan, who led the school during a time of soaring endowment growth that allowed her to focus on the issues that have won her wide acclaim—bridging
divides among a polarized faculty, reinvigorating student life, and poaching
big-name academics for the school’s faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School professor Lee O. Fleming is pleading not guilty to charges of assault and battery after police arrested him last week for allegedly throwing hot coffee at an individual during a parking dispute.
Fleming's lawyer, Paul R. Mastrocola of Burns & Levinson LLP, said that the professor "looks forward to addressing these allegations in court." He and Fleming both declined to comment on the specifics of the incident and court proceedings due to the pending criminal charges, but Mastrocola added that they are confident the professor will be vindicated. He did confirm that the dispute took place on a Cambridge public street.
According to the Cambridge Police Department's online Daily Public Log, Fleming and another individual got into an argument on June 1 about a parking situation, after which Fleming "threatened the victim with a thermos and threw hot coffee all over the victim." He was arrested at 8:43 a.m. for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (hot coffee) and by means of a dangerous weapon (thermos).
Cambridge Police Department spokesman Frank T. Pasquarello said that the investigation is ongoing and that both parties have been cooperating with police. He declined to disclose the identity of the victim.
Media write-ups of the altercation based on a police report state that Fleming called police after finding a car parked in front of his driveway. The situation reportedly escalated after the car's owner came out to move the vehicle, although Fleming is said to have apologized for his actions after he cooled down.
Pasquarello said he did not have the police report on hand but said that it was based on the testimony of both parties. A magistrate will likely hear both sides' testimony in a couple weeks to determine if there is probable cause to justify a hearing in front of a judge, he added.
"Hopefully things get resolved so that both people are satisfied with the outcome," Pasquarello said.
The Cambridge District Court declined to share information on the case's scheduling and proceedings over the telephone.
Fleming, who earned his doctorate in organizational behavior at Stanford, competed on the U.S. National Cycling Team in college, according to his Web site. His research examines ways that managers can help their organizations make breakthroughs through collaboration and scientific strategies, and he teaches a multidisciplinary course that brings together students from business, science, engineering, and medicine to work on science commercialization projects.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake referred questions about University censure for the professor to the Business School, and James E. Aisner '68, a spokesman for HBS, declined to comment on the incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University has announced that a total of 531 staff members chose to participate in its Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program, or roughly a third of the 1,628 members that were eligible.Participation rates throughout the University's schools and units ranged from 7 to 41 percent, according to the figures presented in the June 2009 issue of Harvard Resource, the University's employee newspaper. The majority of staffers accepting the incentives came from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Central Administration, which respectively contributed 156 and 177 workers--acceptance rates of roughly 30 percent and 34 percent. Harvard Business School had the highest rate, with nearly 41 percent (42 out of 103) of eligible staff members accepting the buyout.University spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to characterize the results of the program in any way, saying that the participation rate speaks for itself. He also declined to comment on the costs or savings achieved by the program, but noted that it was primarily funded through assets set aside for the University's defined-benefit pension plan.Harvard's financial report for fiscal year 2008 showed an apparent surplus of nearly $300 million in the University's pension-plan assets after subtracting away benefit obligations of roughly $600 million, suggesting that the University may have been able to pay for the retirement incentives without its increasing near-term costs.The Program was a key cost-cutting initiative devised by the University this past year in response to a planned 30 percent drop in value of the endowment over the fiscal year, which has also caused an 8 percent drop in the amount paid out from the endowment to the University's schools next year. Because compensation costs comprise nearly half of Harvard's annual $3.5 billion operating budget, University officials have long alluded to the need for further layoffs, which have been rumored to take place by the end of the summer.Galvin said that it is "premature" to predict when workforce changes will take place. He also said that discussions are continuing about the feasibility of a similar early retirement incentive for faculty members, but said that creating such a program is "a complex proposition that will require extensive deliberation by the deans and University leadership."Similar staff early retirement incentive programs have been used at Dartmouth and Cornell in recent months as well. At Cornell, 423 staffers applied for and received buyouts out of approximately 1,300 eligible workers, representing a yield of roughly 30 percent--nearly double the 10 to 15 percent that had been anticipated by administrators there, according to the Cornell Daily Sun.Harvard's Program was implemented in two waves: first for FAS, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and then for the remainder of the University's units. While FAS and HMS account for the largest fractions of the University's endowment, Galvin said the two-phase design was purely for administrative reasons. In each wave, eligible staff--participants in Harvard's Defined Benefit Plan aged 55 and over with at least 10 years of service--were given a 45-day consideration period during which they could decide to accept the incentive, followed by a 7-day period during which they could reconsider. The first wave began on Feb. 17, and the second began on March 16.Galvin said that in addition to Harvard's normal pension benefits, staff members who accepted the buyout packages received a one-time retirement lump-sum payment equal to one year's annual salary, a "bridge benefit" of $750 per month until Social Security eligibility at age 62, and a waiver on the "rule of 75"--which stipulates that an employee's age plus service must equal 75--for retiree medical eligibility. He said that while most of the staff would leave the University by the end of June, some may remain for a few extra months in order to ensure a smooth transition.FAS Dean Michael D. Smith had announced in April that 153 out of 521 eligible staff in his school accepted the buyout packages--a slight discrepancy from the most recent figures possibly caused by the delayed delivery of packages, according to University spokesman John D. Longbrake. But in light of a looming $220 million FAS budget deficit over the next two years, only $77 million of which has been accounted for through the cost-saving measures that have already been announced, Smith and other administrators are now looking to conduct a broad-based restructuring of the University's largest school.--Staff writer Peter F.
