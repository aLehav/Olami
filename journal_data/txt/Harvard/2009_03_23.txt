After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Crimson wrestlers traveled to St. Louis, Mo. for the NCAA championships this past weekend and one proved more at home than the rest. Junior co-captain Louis Caputo took advantage of a supportive atmosphere in his native “Show Me State” to outwrestle his seed and claim All-American honors for the second time in his career.
The third-year grappler joined fellow junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor and sophomore Corey Jantzen as Harvard’s national championship representatives, but enjoyed by far the most successful tournament.
“I think Louis wrestled better than he ever has at Harvard,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I was really proud of the way he [competed].”
After spending his sophomore season sidelined with an injury, Caputo capped a healthy junior season with a stellar overall performance. The grappler entered the championships as the 11th seed, upsetting sixth-seeded Joshua Patterson of Binghamton before facing off against Purdue’s A.J. Kessel in the round of 12. This pivotal round distilled competitors into six All-Americans and six grapplers who return home without hardware. Fortunately for Caputo, he was up to the challenge, besting Kessel 2-1 to advance and extend the Crimson’s streak of honoring an All-American to four straight years.
“I’m really proud of [Caputo] for coming back from injury and wrestling better than his seed,” O’Connor said. “It’s just awesome; he’s a great wrestler and a great competitor.”
Despite the impressive run, Caputo could not top all of the vaunted wrestlers in the 184 lbs. weight class. The Harvard junior fell to defending national champion Mike Pucillo of Ohio State in the quarterfinals.
Dispatched to the consolation round, Caputo found himself face-to-face with growing nemesis Phil Keddy from Iowa. Caputo dropped two bouts this season to Keddy and NCAA’s brought a familiar result. Caputo suffered a heartbreaking 2-0 defeat, sending him to the seventh place bout, where he fell in a rematch with Patterson. But considering the difficulty of earning All-American honors in the wake of a devastating injury, Caputo expressed enthusiasm for the result.
“I’m actually very happy,” he said. “Last year was disappointing and I’m glad I haven’t lost too much ground. [Coming back from injury] is mostly mental and I’m glad I still have that edge.”
O’Connor and Jantzen did not fare as well. Attempting to return as an All-American at 157 after placing sixth last year at 149, O’Connor entered the tournament hopeful as the fourth seed. Unfortunately for the junior star, NCAA’s proved full of surprises. Considering the first round bid goodbye to 19 seeded wrestlers, O’Connor’s path to the round of 12 already marked a successful weekend. But the Harvard co-captain endured a frustrating 1-0 loss to Edinboro’s Greg Gillespie—a grappler he defeated twice this season—a decision that denied O’Connor All-American standing.
“I’m incredibly disappointed,” a disconsolate O’Connor said. “It’s probably one of my worst performances…I felt like I didn’t show up with my best and when you go into a tournament like that you have to show up every match.”
O’Connor could not recover in his consolation bout, falling 2-1 to Chase Pami of Cal Poly. The Crimson wrestler led 1-0 entering the third frame, but gave up a reversal and relinquished his riding advantage, dropping the bout and leaving the standout looking for an explanation.
“I don’t know what the answers are,” he said. “Obviously there were opportunities I didn’t take advantage of, but I guess it’s back to the drawing board.”
Despite O’Connor’s setback, Weiss put the difficult competition in perspective, insisting that his grappler’s effort was not without merit.
“That [157 lbs.] weight class was ridiculously hard,” Weiss said. “Going for third and fourth were two former national champions, that’s how difficult it was.”
The Crimson’s final competitor faced the hardest tournament of all, bowing out before he really got started. In Jantzen’s first bout, his opponent pulled around him in a takedown attempt as the sophomore’s ankle got caught in the mat. Jantzen had nursed a bad ankle throughout the season and this final twist proved too much for the joint to bear.
As the Harvard grappler fell to the mat, he not only suffered a match-ending pin, but was also forced to medically forfeit his consolation bout.
While two of the Crimson’s elite competitors expressed dissatisfaction with their season-ending performances, all three nationally-ranked wrestlers will return for Harvard in the fall, heading a talented squad and harboring ambitions of making another run at national titles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard fencing team continued its tradition of success by gaining a fifth-place finish at the NCAA Men’s and Women’s Fencing Championships this past weekend hosted by perennial fencing powerhouse Penn State.
The Crimson used a combination of experienced leadership and strong rookie performances to stay competitive on the largest stage of the season and improve from its 2008 sixth-place finish.
“We are very pleased to have accomplished our highest finish since we won the title in 2006,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It was also quite remarkable that we only sent nine fencers, and we were still able to compete and beat teams like St. John’s, who sent eleven. Doing that was special.”
The men’s fencing squad put Harvard in good position after finishing their portion ranked 10th overall. Co-captain Benjamin Ungar led the men by finishing third overall in the epee and garnering All-American first-team honors, his second All-American nomination. The No. 3 seed Ungar was in first place after the first day but fell to No. 2 seed Slava Zingerman of Wayne State in the semifinals. Ungar also helped extend Harvard’s streak of consecutive seasons with an All-American selection to four.
Freshman Valentin Staller also helped the Crimson by riding nine victories and 78 touches on his way to a 15th place finish in the sabre.
Despite having a young squad, the women’s fencing unit rose to the occasion to help lift the Crimson to its fifth-place finish. As a team, the Crimson finished with 116 victories, only falling short to national champion Penn State (195), Notre Dame (182), Ohio State (166), and Columbia (151).
The women’s unit was led by freshmen Noam Mills and Caroline Vloka, both of whom finished second overall in their respective events. Vloka, the No. 2 seed in the women’s sabre, posted a 20-3 record and amassed 105 touches in the preliminary rounds, but lost 15-4 in the final.
“I’m quite optimistic with world-class players like Vloka and Mills,” Brand said. “We are looking forward to having them play major roles on our squad for the next three years. Noam has continued to develop and is getting better both on the world scene and on our squad. They are both setting their goals for the 2012 Olympic Games, so it will be fortunate to continue to have those forces on our team.”
Mills, a 2008 Olympian with Israel, was the No. 1 seed entering the tournament. She posted a 21-2 record in the first seven rounds, but fell short 15-9 in the women’s epee gold medal match. Both Vloka and Mills were named All-Americans for their efforts. 
“I think that Noam was very disappointed to not win her final match, but she is a very determined athlete, and I certainly expect to see her back in the same position next year,” Brand said. 
Co-captain Emily Cross, a 2008 Olympic silver medalist with Team USA, won 21 out of 24 matches to qualify for the semifinal in the foil division. Cross lost a gritty 8-7 match to eventual champion Doris Willette of Penn State to finish in third place and earn her third career All-American selection. Cross also represented the fourth Crimson fencer of the tournament to make an event final four, setting a new Harvard fencing record.
“We were very disappointed that Emily didn’t go out on top after coming back from the Olympic games,” Brand said. “Emily is one of the best fencers that Harvard has ever had, and arguably the top fencer for Team USA. It’s amazing that she came back from the Olympic games and continued to fence for us.”
Harvard was also helped by the efforts of freshman Shelby MacLeod, who placed 17th in the foil, and senior Maria Larsson, who gained eight victories in the epee to also place 17th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For women swimmers in the Ivy League, the NCAA Championship is a big deal. Such a big deal, that this year only three female swimmers from all eight Ivy League schools attended.Two came from Harvard.Finishing the year off on a high note, junior Ali Clarke and sophomore Kate Mills received invites to the 2009 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships at Texas A&M after solid performances at this year’s Ivy League championships.Invited after placing first at Ivies, Mills was tapped to race in her signature event, the 200-yard freestyle. She also competed in the 200-yard butterfly event and the 500-yard freestyle event, for which she placed third at Ivies behind Clarke and Princeton’s Alicia Aemisegger. Aemisegger was the only other Ivy swimmer to compete at NCAAs. Clarke, racing in the 500-yard freestyle, also raced in the 1650-yard freestyle, which she qualified for after placing second at Ivies—once again behind Aemisegger.The championship, which started on Thursday, was a big change for both Crimson athletes.“I think the biggest thing that’s different is that there are just two of us, instead of the usual 20 that we bring to every meet,” Mills said. “It’s also different because we get to compete against all of these people that we normally don’t compete against in the Ivy League.”But both Mills and Clarke had some idea of the competition they prepared to face after having raced at NCAAs the previous year.“We weren’t that nervous [this year],” Mills said. “We both swam our best events—the ones that we like to swim. Everyone went so fast to get [to NCAAs] that we are all among equals, if that makes any sense. In most races everything was close.”In only the second event of NCAAs, both Clarke and Mills took to the water in the 500-yard freestyle preliminary race. Out of 64 athletes, Clarke placed 46th with a time of 4:47.47, while Mills touched the wall 47th with a time of 4:47.75. With these times, neither Clarke nor Mills advanced to the finals, where Allison Schmitt from Georgia placed first in a time of 4:35.17.For both athletes, these times were considerably slower than their qualifying times from Ivies, where Clarke raced the 500 yards in 4:42.84 and Mills in 4:43.41.Mills, however, was positive about the experience, since she was not even sure if she would race in NCAAs after undergoing leg surgery last year.“I think we both did well,” Mills said. “For me, I learned some things that I really need to work on. I didn’t have quite the leg strength that I wanted to. Of course I would have loved to have gone faster, but it was a very solid, very good meet for me.”On Friday, Clarke took the day to rest while Mills competed in the 200-yard freestyle event. Out of a field of 64 athletes, Mills tied for 37th with Texas A&M swimmer Marissa Jasek with a time of 1:47.35, less than a second slower than her qualifying time of 1:46.39.When the sun rose Saturday morning, Clarke stood ready on the starting block for her last race as a junior. In the 1650-yard freestyle event, out of 43 swimmers, Clarke placed 28th in a time of 16:19.17.Watching Clarke compete, Mills prepared to attack her final race of the season. In her third event of the meet, the 200-yard butterfly, Mills received the best placing for Harvard at this year’s championships, placing 23rd out of 42 with a time of 1:56.72. While not enough to qualify for the final, Mills was only five seconds off of first place in the preliminaries and .49 seconds off of her qualifying time.  Though neither Clarke nor Mills qualified for the finals—leaving Harvard off of the team scoreboard—the two Crimson swimmers learned about the persistence and strength needed to compete with the nation’s best.Both athletes returned home on Sunday, ready not only for spring break, but also for a chance to get back in the water and begin preparing for next year.“We were very happy when we left,” Mills said. “We realized what we need to work on to be All-American [top 16] next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard opened a string of contests on the sunny West Coast this past Saturday against the No. 1 Stanford Cardinals, followed by a match-up against Sonoma State on Sunday afternoon. The Crimson (5-7) dropped the contest against the Cardinals 20-2, but rallied with a hard-fought victory over Sonoma State, 8-7. The two contests mark the beginning of Harvard’s California Spring Break road trip, its longest road trip of the season.All week competition is played outdoors where Harvard faces a harsher environment than at home in Blodgett Pool.  “The ball does behave a little differently [outdoors],” Crimson coach Erik Farrar said. “So [the team] has to reacclimate to the conditions.” Harvard closes out the six-game week against Pacific, UC-Santa Cruz, No. 12 UC-Davis, and Cal State-Monterey Bay later in the week.“We’re looking for experience out here,” Farrar said of the Crimson’s goals for the week. “We’re playing six games against six good teams…and if we can play with them, even just for stretches in a game, it gives us a chance to know what we’re made of.” HARVARD 8, SONOMA STATE 7The Crimson rebounded from its loss to Stanford to outscore the Sonoma State Seawolves in comeback fashion on Sunday afternoon at Rohnert Park, Calif. With the win, Harvard advanced to 5-7 overall on the season and 1-1 to start its six-game West Coast trip.Sonoma State jumped to an early 3-1 lead in the first quarter with Harvard failing to convert on several initial opportunities. The Crimson still trailed the Seawolves 6-3 at the half.“It took us a little while to adapt to the officiating, and we got into a little foul trouble early,” Farrar said of the first half.In the second half, momentum shifted in Harvard’s favor. The Crimson defense put up a wall against the charging Sonoma State offense, allowing only one goal by the Seawolves the remainder of the game. Co-captain Nicola Perlman, who is also a former Crimson magazine chair, saved 11 shots, including two fired at close range from a mere five meters out.Harvard’s offense ignited in the second half. The Crimson outscored Sonoma State 4-0 in the third quarter and 5-1 overall in the second half of the game. “The team just took [Sonoma State’s] punch from the first half,” Farrar said. “Then [the girls] dug in and went right back at them.”Five different players tallied points for the Crimson on Sunday. Freshmen Monica Zdrojewski and Shannon Purcell recorded two goals apiece. Junior Kristina Bergquist and freshman Devan Kennifer added scores of their own. And, with 1:32 remaining in the game, freshman Lizzie Abbott netted the crucial goal to put the Crimson ahead of the Seawolves.NO. 1 STANFORD 20, HARVARD 2Harvard fell to the No. 1 Stanford Cardinal in its first game of a weeklong trip to the West Coast Saturday evening. Stanford held a 12-0 advantage over the Crimson until the third quarter when Harvard responded with two goals of its own. “By the third quarter of the game we didn’t let the fact that they are the No. 1 team get to us,” sophomore Patty Smith said. “We didn’t let them get to us and decided to play our game.”Junior Roxanne Pinto and Smith recorded Harvard’s scores against the tough Cardinal defense. On the defensive end, Perlman had six saves between the pipes for the Crimson.  Harvard dropped to 4-7 on the season. “This week will be a test of our endurance,” Smith said. “We’re playing almost everyday against some challenging opponents.”

Since the advent of dreadfully embarrassing sex-ed classes, American young'uns have been repeatedly told  (and awkwardly shown) to use condoms. Safe sex = wrap it up. Even middle schoolers grasped the message.
But the Pope has recently generated a media firestorm by questioning the effectiveness of rubbers in fighting STDs. And now,  the director of Harvard's AIDS Prevention Research Project has got the pontiff's back. So what's a college student on Spring Break to do? Is this the end of awkward banana demonstrations in middle school? FlyBy has your answer, after the jump.
Not so much.  According to Edward C.  Green, the AIDS project director, condoms can be ineffective or harmful in preventing the spread of AIDS in Africa. And while those  comments have drawn considerable controversy, Green says they only extend to the epidemic in Africa.  In America, where AIDS isn't as prevalent, he says condoms have been shown to be effective to an extent.
And according to UHS, they're the "best form of protection."  So as you let off steam during spring break, well, don't leave home without them.
