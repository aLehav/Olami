After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 2 Harvard men’s heavyweight crew won its 14th straight Adams Cup over No. 15 Penn and No. 9 Navy Saturday. The No. 1 men’s lightweights also had a strong performance this weekend. The team won its fourth-straight Goldthwait Cup at the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The men’s heavyweight team earned wins in the first eight, second varsity, and freshman race Saturday morning in excellent conditions on the Charles River.
The first varsity eight beat the Midshipmen and the Quakers with a winning time of 5:39.7. The Crimson was dominant from the start and stretched its lead to open water over the course of the race, ultimately beating second-place Penn by more than eight seconds.
“We were aware Navy and Penn would really try and drop the hammer around the 900-meter mark,” said senior Josh Hicks, the third seat in the first varsity boat. “We prepared for it and pressed our advantage off the start…. We didn’t really care where they were after a certain point and focused on our boat and putting together a complete race.”
The second varsity won what would be the closest race of the day, posting a 1.8 second victory over Navy.
Though Harvard won the majority of the races on the day, the third and fourth varsity races belonged to the Midshipmen. Navy completed the course in 6:03.6 to beat the Crimson by just over five seconds in the third varsity race, while the Midshipmen’s fourth varsity boat recorded a nine second advantage over the second-place Quakers.
Harvard ended the day on a high note with a win by its freshman boat in 5:52.4 to beat second-place Penn.
“We realize that a cocky attitude can cost you races that you should win,” Hicks said. “We try to avoid that attitude by looking back to tough races in previous years against Penn and Navy to get us fired up. We aren’t thinking about how we are undefeated or anything. It is always just ‘next practice, next race.’”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The No. 1 first varsity boat showed its dominance at the annual HYP regatta by defeating No. 2 Yale and No. 6 Princeton to earn the Goldthwait Cup in Princeton, N.J. on Saturday. The Crimson also won the Vogel cup for its team performance, winning four of the five races on the day.
The Bulldogs held the lead in the varsity race through the entire first half of the competition. However, at the 1,000-meter mark the Harvard varsity eight started to make its move. The Crimson was able to eke out the come-from-behind victory by just 1.4 seconds.
“We knew Yale was going to be fast and that we were going to have to work to reel them in later,” said junior Michael Wales, second seat of the first varsity boat. “We weren’t really expecting to be that far down at the 1,000-meter mark, but about that time is when I felt the boat really shift. I could tell that was the point we started to move on them, and that last 500 was some of the best rowing we have had all season.”
In the second varsity race, Harvard led for most of the way, but was challenged by a charging Tigers boat near the finish. Harvard was able to hold off Princeton for the win while Yale took third in the race.
The third varsity race also belonged to the Crimson as Harvard finished with a time of 6:15.2, a full five seconds ahead of the second-place Bulldogs. The lone loss for the Crimson on the day came in the freshman eight, as Yale took first and the Tigers took second.
In the first race of the morning, the two Harvard freshman fours started the day off strong with a one-two finish over Princeton.
“I think the whole team is pretty stoked about the results we had today,” Wales said. “Three wins across the board—it was great weather against stiff competition. It was a pretty solid weekend for all Harvard boats.”
As it is for many other Crimson sports teams, the HYP meet is an important meet with a long tradition. As of late, the Harvard lightweights have been nothing less than dominant in the annual event, winning eight out of the past 11 Vogel cups while pushing its streak of Golthwait Cups to four.
“The HYP is always a special event,” Wales said. “The rowers and the alumni really get up for it and the three programs are full of talented athletes year after year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of the night, every time Peter Russell went for an attack, it felt inevitable that it would garner another point for the Nittany Lions. Led by the junior outside hitter, Penn State defeated Harvard, 3-0, in the Crimson’s first ever EIVA finals appearance.
The Crimson’s loss to tournament host No. 14 Penn State (23-7, 13-1 EIVA) is only the second time Harvard (18-9, 10-4) has been swept by a conference opponent this season.
The matchup in the postseason finale marked the third time the Crimson and the Nittany Lions have met this year. During their two regular season meetings, each team won on its home court, with Penn State winning, 3-2, in the first meeting and Harvard winning, 3-0, at the Malkin Athletic Center. The trend continued in the playoffs as the home team came out on top once again.
With plenty of tape to study after their closely contested regular season games, both teams tried to make adjustments coming into the game based on what they thought the other squad’s strategy would be.
“I give Penn State a lot of credit,” co-captain and setter Rob Lothman said. “We spent a considerable amount of time game-planning them, and we thought we had them pegged. They came out and made a lot of adjustments we weren’t expecting, and that was the difference.”
Sophomore outside hitter DJ White and sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick led the Crimson offense on the evening, and each was recognized for his postseason play by being named to the 2013 EIVA All-Tournament Team.
White had a team-high nine kills to go along with one dig and one block, while Zimmick posted a .714 hitting percentage on six kills.
Harvard stayed close to the Nittany Lions throughout most of the third set, bringing the score to 16-13 at one point. However, a 9-3 closing run by Penn State completed the sweep for the home team and gave the Nittany Lions their 15th straight EIVA title.
“It was not for a lack of effort that we lost tonight—Penn State just came out and played really well,” junior co-captain and opposite hitter Nick Madden said. “They served really well and passed really well, and I think serving at their place just made them really comfortable.”
Penn State’s offense was led by strong performances from the Russell brothers. Peter Russell finished with an outstanding 14 kills on a .875 hitting percentage. Not to be outdone, Aaron Russell tallied 10 kills, eight digs, and three blocks.
The first set was back-and-forth to start, as Harvard was able to hang with the Nittany Lions, 16-13. But two 3-0 runs by the Nittany Lions down the stretch gave them the set, 25-16.
With Penn State’s offense clicking, the Crimson’s two captains led the defensive effort for the visiting squad. Madden finished with a team-high six digs to go along with six kills and one block. Lothman, meanwhile, handed out 25 assists and added five digs.
The second stanza went much the same way as the first for the Crimson, as it was able to stick around early before falling once again, 25-16.
Harvard’s biggest weakness on the night was its blocking, as the Crimson failed to record a block until the final set. And while Harvard did tally a few blocks in the third, it was too little, too late.
“They played really well in every facet of the game,” Lothman said. “On our side, I thought our blocking lagged a lot throughout the match. It is really hard to beat a team if you can’t stop them at the net.”
The first finals appearance for the Crimson in the EIVA final also marked the last game for the three seniors on the team: Lothman, setter Derek Jansma, and middle blocker Dan Martin. Lothman ends his career as the all-time assists leader in Harvard history with 3,043 over his four years.
Yet, as Lothman was quick to point out, the Crimson’s continuing rise in the EIVA was the season’s biggest story line and the biggest takeaway from the game. Just last season, Harvard made the EIVA postseason for the first time. Now, this year’s team has one-upped that feat by winning the program’s first postseason match.
“I think we have proven that we are here to stay,” Lothman said. “Last year it was just getting to the playoffs, and this year it was winning a game in the playoffs. Hopefully next year we can take another step and win two games in the playoffs and the championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the home stretch of their seasons, the Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight crews look to compete near the top of the national rankings.
The top-ranked lightweight crews defended the Charles against MIT, and as they have all season, the first and second varsity eights emerged victorious. Undefeated for the first time in over five years, the lightweights will head to Eastern Sprints and the IRA National Championships next to vie for its first ever national championship.
“We’re pretty used to being underdogs, so it feels pretty good to be the one that everyone’s chasing, with the targets on our backs,” said senior Emma Lukasiewicz, sixth seat of the lightweight first varsity eight. “Now that our expectations are higher, and we know that we’re capable of winning all of these races, we definitely put more pressure on ourselves, but I think we’re ready to rise to that challenge.”
The heavyweight crews also spent the weekend on their home river, taking on Northeastern and Yale on Saturday, followed by a bevy of Boston teams in the rescheduled Beanpot on Sunday. The first varsity eight lost a heartbreaker to the Bulldogs, who crossed the line just a second earlier, but the crew redeemed itself the next day with a convincing victory in the Beanpot.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe heavyweights ended their weekend on a high note, taking home a win in every race of the Beanpot on Sunday. The second varsity fours and third varsity eights began the racing, claiming six- and 14-second victories, respectively, over Boston College, Northeastern, Holy Cross, and Boston University.
The NCAA-qualifying races were next, in which the first varsity fours crossed the line 13 seconds ahead of BU. The first and second varsity eights displayed near identical results, with both boats besting Beanpot foes by about 14 seconds.
After taking down Yale and Northeastern in each of the earlier races on Saturday, the Radcliffe heavyweights sent their top boat to face the Bulldogs and Huskies. The crews got off to a clean start, but about 800 meters into the race, there was a collision of oars between the Black and White and Yale, which led to a protest of the results by Radcliffe.
“The Harvard-Radcliffe-Yale relationship dates way back to very early on, so it’s always a very exciting race, and Yale actually got quite a bit faster over the past week, so it was a really close race,” said senior Jess Mealia, sixth seat of the first varsity eight. “In rowing, when boats come into each other’s lanes, there’s often oar clashing. Yale was actually I think a little bit in our lane, but for some reason, the two boats converged for a few strokes in the race, which resulted in some oar clashing, and when things like that happen, the coxswain is allowed to protest the race, and we did that.”
The officials upheld the results, and the Bulldogs came away with the win, finishing the race in 6:20.3, ahead of the Black and White by under two seconds.
The second varsity fours started the racing on the day and finished with a commanding 11-second victory over its foes. The first varsity fours, rowing in one of the three NCAA-qualifying races, lined up next and won by three seconds.
The third varsity eights then took to the river and won by the largest margin of the day, 14 seconds. Continuing the winning streak was the second varsity eights, who rowed the 2000-meter course in 6:35.3 to cross the finish line six seconds ahead of Yale.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Displaying the blue and yellow of “Row for Boston” instead of the usual Black and White, the lightweight first varsity eights, unblemished all spring, pulled out a dominating open-water finish, rowing the course over 12 seconds faster than the Engineers.
“[MIT’s] a fast program that’s just getting faster and faster, which is really exciting to see,” Lukasiewicz said. “We had a really intense week of training, so it was nice to finish off that week with a good race before we head off towards Sprints, and a lot of this weekend was about our Row for Boston campaign, supporting the Boston Children’s Hospital, so it was really great to be out there with two really great Boston programs and wearing the same t-shirts to show our solidarity for our city.”
In the second varsity race that followed the contest between the top boats, Radcliffe displayed a similar result, with both the second and third varsity crews edging MIT’s second varsity boat by 20 and 10 seconds, respectively.
The novice fours represented the Black and White’s only loss on the day, as the Engineers bested Radcliffe’s novice ‘A’ boat by nearly 15 seconds, finishing the course in 8:17.5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing a do-or-die regular season finale against rival No. 15 Yale Bulldogs, a late rally by the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-8, 2-4 Ivy) came up just short. The team led 4-2 early on after three goals by junior attacker Peter Schwartz but a third-quarter flurry by the Bulldogs and senior Yale attacker Kirby Zdrill—who had four goals on the day—put Yale up 10-7, a lead that it would not relinquish.
“Our kids left it all out on the field and we just came up short,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “I think both teams played your typical Harvard-Yale game. The effort was great. Both ends thought it was a really even game throughout on shots and ground balls.”
A TALE OF TWO QUARTERS
The Crimson began by controlling play, passing the ball around the perimeter and probing the Bulldog defense for holes. Harvard went up 2-0 on a pair of goals by Schwartz and scored on two of its first three possessions of the game.
“We hit our shots early, simple as that,” Wojcik said.
The Crimson entered the game last in the league with just over 32 shots a game, while Yale was third with nearly 41 a game but the roles were reversed in the first quarter when Harvard outshot Yale, 5-4. Harvard, which shoots less than 30 percent on the season, made three of the five shots it took while holding the Bulldogs to 25 percent shooting on the quarter.
“I think we came out fast, really pushing the ball in the offense, just playing fast and really pushing the ball,” captain Jason Gonos said. “The offense was really pushing the ball and playing smart-aggressive. And the defense was making some stops. So overall, it seemed like we were clicking as a team.”
The third quarter was a complete role reversal, however. Yale outscored Harvard, 5-2, to go up, 10-7, with four goals in less than three minutes that took the game from a 5-5 tie to a 9-5 Bulldog lead. During that time, Yale converted on both of its extra-man opportunities after missing on both of its chances in the first quarter.
“That’s the nature of the game,” Wojick said. “You can’t commit fouls, and with a good man-up team like that, it’s going to hurt you. They capitalized on their chances…. After the first quarter they scored on all four of their man-ups. And when you score on man-up, you’re able to get on a run there.”
WINNING THE DRAW
After coming in as the fifth-ranked team in the Ancient Eight in faceoff percentage, winning only 48.6 percent of all faceoffs, Harvard won 18 of the 24 faceoffs in the game. Yale came in as the best team in the Ivy League, winning nearly 62 percent of its faceoffs coming in, but won only 25 percent against the Crimson.
In the last quarter, when Harvard made a late push, it won all five faceoffs to maintain possession and get extra possession. As freshman Ian Ardrey and senior attackman Jack Walker scored back-to-back goals that brought Harvard within one, the Crimson garnered extra possessions by winning faceoff after faceoff.
“I thought [senior midfielder Ricky Molé] did an unbelievable job,” Wojick said. “He had a great week, was very prepared, and he stepped up. A senior on Senior Day, he stepped up and won possessions for us. I thought it was a tremendous performance on Ricky’s part, throughout the game and in particular the fourth quarter where he won all five draws.”
OFF THE BENCH
One breakout star in the game for the Crimson was Ardrey. Having only scored five goals in his career coming in, the freshman scored four goals in the game for Harvard, none more meaningful than the unassisted goal with two minutes left that brought the Crimson within two.
Ardrey began his scoring with a goal before halftime that halted a three-goal Yale run to tie the game up at five before halftime. After Yale took a 9-5 lead in the second half, Ardrey had two goals—the second of which brought Harvard to within 10-8 with six minutes left in the game.
“[He] is just a very tough-nosed player, and he was just playing so hard [Saturday],” Gonos said. “He was running through the middle of the crease, taking hits, but he was putting balls in the back of the net, and that was huge for us. He’s going to do big things here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team sent a handful of field athletes to the historic Penn Relays over the weekend. With the Outdoor Heptagonal Championships taking place next weekend, the Crimson athletes who were in action turned in some strong performances, including personal-bests.
“Overall, we took a low-key approach to the weekend,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “This weekend isn’t necessarily the best barometer of where things are at for next weekend, because we had a number of our people not compete to kind of rest up and get ready for [Heps].”
On the men’s side, sophomore Igor Liokumovich threw a lifetime-best mark in the discus to earn fifth place. On the second of his six throws in the event, the sophomore registered a toss of 51.61 meters, his personal best at that point. But on his final throw of the competition, he bettered that effort by over a meter, finishing with a mark of 52.87 meters, the fifth best in school history.
“Igor is a talented athlete, and he’s shown some real flashes of brilliance,” Saretsky said. “It was great to see things really come together for him this weekend.”
Senior Mary Hirst tied her outdoor all-time best mark in the high jump. The veteran cleared the bar at 1.76 meters, which was good for eighth place in the event. Hirst’s outdoor mark stands as the fourth best in school history, just three centimeters below Kart Siilats ’03 for a spot in the top three.
“I was hoping and kind of expecting to get 1.80 again—that’s what I was going for and I was thinking I was going to get it, so I was kind of disappointed that I didn’t get that,” Hirst said. “But I’m happy that I went and was in competition with those girls that I’ll be competing with [at regionals and nationals].”
The meet, which is held at Penn’s Franklin Field, had over 22,000 entries this year, ranging from high school to the professional level. With an attendance of over 100,000 people, including 48,871 on the meet’s final day, it is the best-attended track meet in the United States each year.
“It’s like the kind of crowd you would get for a big football game,” Hirst said. “You get chills watching some of the races because the crowd gets so into it.”
After competing in the largest meet of the year, the Crimson is set to shift its focus to the most important meet on its calendar.
“I was really pleased with the student-athletes that did compete this weekend; they got in some good work,” Saretsky said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With spring ball over, the Harvard football team enters the summer with many questions left unanswered.
In Harvard Stadium on Saturday night, the Crimson showcased some of its offseason work in its annual spring game. With a 15-minute running clock in all quarters and changing lineups on both the “Crimson” and “White” teams throughout, both sides struggled to string together cohesive drives.
The first half was dominated largely by passing plays as both sides moved in a fast-paced offense, but the quarterbacks struggled to find a rhythm. On multiple occasions, there appeared to be miscommunication between quarterback and receiver.
Rising junior Connor Hempel, whom Harvard coach Tim Murphy currently lists at the top of the quarterback depth chart with rising senior Michael Pruneau still held out of full practice while recovering from a knee injury, led the Crimson team and finished 13-of-22 for 113 yards. While rising sophomore Tanner Wrisley called plays for the White team for much of the game, the fourth quarter saw a few snaps for rising sophomores Jimmy Meyer and Scott Hosch.
After missing much of the 2012 season with a hand injury, rising junior Seitu Smith became Hempel’s favorite target in the second half, hanging on to a 23-yard pass to start the second half. Smith, along with rising senior Cameron Brate and rising junior Tyler Hamblin, dubbed by Murphy as recently-drafted Kyle Juszcyzk’s replacement, led the receiving corps for the first-team offense. Along with rising sophomore Andrew Fischer, Murphy notes that the group brings speed to the wideout position and stability to the tight end spots, keys to the two-tight-end offense that Harvard ran with historical success last year with Juszczyk and Brate at tight end.
“We had the unusual luxury of having not one, but two great tight ends, two All-American tight ends, two NFL-caliber tight ends [last year],” Murphy said. “We thought we’d be going back to 11-personnel this year with guys like [rising senior] Andrew Berg, [rising senior] Ricky Zorn, Seitu Smith, but Tyler Hamblin has been so efficient in spring football…. He seems to pick up things so easily, he’s so conscientious, so I don’t know if we’re going to have the full effect that we had with Kyle, but right now, we haven’t changed anything because [Hamblin] has given us the luxury of just picking up where we left off.”
Both touchdowns scored in the game, which represented the only points tallied by either team, happened in the span of less than a minute during the second quarter on running plays. The White team, led by Wrisley, got on the scoreboard first. The rookie corralled a high snap from rising junior Anthony Fabiano and scrambled seven yards into the end zone.
Two plays later, rising sophomore tailback Paul Stanton Jr. showed off his speed in the open field, exploding on a 74-yard touchdown run to knot the score at seven apiece.
Rising junior Andrew Casten also displayed sparks of speed and power, running over rising sophomore Scott Peters on one scamper and breaking multiple tackles on other runs.
Zach Boden, who will likely be relied upon in the absence of outgoing running back Treavor Scales, did not play in the spring game.
“Do we have a Treavor Scales, a Gino Gordon, a Clifton Dawson?” Murphy said. “I don’t know, but we’re really bullish on guys like Zach Boden and Paul Stanton…so again, we feel very comfortable that we’re going to have a very solid running back corps.”
With Jack Holuba graduating, another question seems to come at the center position, where Fabiano and rising senior David Leopard looked to fill the role Saturday but struggled to consistently deliver snaps to quarterbacks in the shotgun formation.
On the other side of the ball, rising senior Luke Zelon excelled, recording 1.5 sacks and 9.5 tackles, pressuring quarterbacks on both sides into throwing the ball away and forcing throws into coverage. Coming off a successful sophomore campaign, rising junior defensive end Zach Hodges recorded four tackles Saturday.
“We’re not going to have the luxury of having the type of depth [at defensive end] we had a year ago,” Murphy said. “I think [rising senior] Danny Frate’s got the edge now, but guys like [rising senior]Austin Taylor, rising sophomore Dan Moody and others—Luke Zelon—are all going to be competing, but it clearly won’t have the type of quality depth that we had a year ago.”
Along the defensive line and throughout the roster, Murphy acknowledged that disjointedness is not rare in spring football as players begin filling new roles.
“You come out that first week, and 20-plus seniors are gone, the core of your leadership is gone, so it doesn’t just seamlessly translate early on,” Murphy said. “It seems like, ‘Wow, we’re really average,’ and then, slowly but surely, some of the question marks get answered.”

Recently, Harvard administrators initiated a community discussion on the possibility of instituting an honor code at Harvard. While the specifics of the code are still being figured out, we at Flyby thought we'd share our thoughts on the preliminary report by giving the Academic Integrity Committee some suggestions for honor code rules we'd like to see enforced. We're not sure how receptive the Committee will be—but hey, it never hurts to try!
 
 
1. All student work must be signed with a "declaration of integrity," though you are allowed to get your one friend with actual integrity to sign it for you.
2. Students shall not plagiarize another's work, unless the original author's name is difficult to spell and you're pretty sure you could have come up with that stuff he said anyway. 
3. Eligibility for expulsion is entirely dependent on a student's vertical leap; the higher the leap the less likely it is you'll get expelled. 
4. Any answers to assignments acquired through non-procedural e-mail searches are entirely acceptable. 
5. Students shall not take exams in place of other students, unless two students are doppelgangers, in which case they must take each other's exams.
