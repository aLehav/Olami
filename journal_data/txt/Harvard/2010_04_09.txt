After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert F. Kennedy ’48 famously asked America “What is the price tag on equal justice under law?”  America might want to answer that there shouldn’t be a price tag on the fairness sought in employment practices.  If so, it’s clear that the current trend in internships perpetuates inequality and must be stopped.  To best remedy this, the United States should eliminate unpaid internships, except for those at non-profits.
We advocate the restriction of unpaid internships because of the structural inequality inherent to acquiring these internships.  Since richer students have the means to forgo wages, socioeconomic class determines, in large part, one’s ability to procure an internship.  This unfair economic stratification means that poorer students and graduates often cannot afford to accept unpaid positions.
Worse, these same students later face de facto discrimination when applying for jobs for which an internship is deemed a stepping-stone.  The majority of firms expressly cited “relevant work experience in the form of internships” as the primary motivation to hire a recent college graduate.  As it stands, if you can’t afford work to without pay before graduating, you might not work at all afterwards.
Additionally, students’ unofficial understanding of the value of an internship skews their perspective on the conditions under which their work is important.  Those who perform menial tasks under the auspices of an internship often receive greater prestige than those who perform the same tasks for pay.  This magnification of an internship experience fails to give equal credit to those who do the same labor but need financial compensation for their work.
To make the transition away from such internships easier, federal funding should subsidize otherwise unpaid positions at non-profits. These organizations often cannot afford to provide their interns with wages, unlike their for-profit counterparts.  This funding would allow students of all backgrounds to consider opportunities outside of the profit sector, and most importantly, ensure that high net worth is not a prerequisite for considering public service as a career option.
While these reforms might result in fewer internship opportunities, this cost is worth the elimination of discrimination—specifically against those who cannot afford the opportunity cost of these internships, namely, working without wages. Employers should continue to value experience, but make it clear to students that it is no longer necessary to hold an internship to get hired.
An attitudinal shift among employers must go hand in hand with changed student focus.  Undergraduates should shift their approach toward other ways to learn skills, such as working for non-profits or volunteering. Additionally, meaningful work can be found in jobs that don’t offer fantastic compensation above minimum wage or the prestige of an internship.
It is also important to keep in mind that the number of opportunities for internships might not decrease as much as would be presumed.  Since unpaid interns still require resources from companies, the resources previously used for unpaid internships could be turned into wages. Moreover, companies will likely hire additional individuals to complete any work that is absolutely necessary.  Finally, those fields that traditionally require job applicants to have completed internships, like journalism, would have to pay students to work for them.  This prediction isn’t speculation—within less than a week of the Times article’s publication investigating the legality of internships, one media outlet discovered apparently previously unavailable resources to compensate all of their interns.
Crucially, this corrective would make employment practices more equitable.  After this change, the significance of a students’ employment history would no longer correlate with the significance of their finances, but instead result from a process of an open contest among all socioeconomic classes. Society can and should remove structural and economic barriers to employment, and firms will have no choice but to survive the increased demand on their resources. If the U.S. eliminates such obstacles, it will move one step closer to making RFK’s question a relic of the past.

“Thank you for your application. We regret to inform you that the position has been filled by another candidate. We wish you the best of luck with your future endeavors.”
What’s the problem with the above sentences? No, nothing’s spelled wrong. There are no grammatical errors. And there aren’t any of those tricky double-word optical illusions either.
The problem with that little paragraph is that I barely saw it during this past job/internship application cycle (and not because I was accepted to everything. We should all be so lucky). Chances are, if you were applying for jobs, you didn’t see it much either because many employers have adopted what can only be described as a silent treatment toward those less-than-worthy applicants. This means that applicants who are not passed to further rounds are never notified of their rejected status. This policy is unreasonable and disrespectful. Employers need to treat their applicants with due regard and grant them the courtesy of knowing where they stand in the job acquisition process. Not responding to an application is simply not acceptable.
The application process through which many employers put us is incredibly rigorous, designed to weed out both those who are not the most capable for the job and those who only “kinda” want it, and leave those who are both qualified and committed. This is not a bad thing, and of course in an ideal world, you would only need to apply for­—and get—jobs you really want. But because of the high probability of rejection these days, we often need to apply for multiple types of jobs, some of which we may be more qualified for than others. Of course, there are people out there who look so good on their applications, who are so incredibly qualified in their chosen fields, that they will never be rejected. But this is not the majority of us. A senior friend of mine has thus far submitted 42 (yes, 42) job applications, and has heard back from “not enough of them.” I myself, after applying for 12 summer positions of various types, heard literally nothing from nine of these organizations. These were applications into which I had poured several hours each, filling out endless forms, crafting cover letters, asking for recommendations, and writing essays. Time and effort that, for the all reaction I got, might have been better spent hanging with my friends or getting homework done. It almost makes you wonder if your application was even considered, even read, even opened in the first place.
This dearth of rejection letters can’t be because of a lack of time or an expenditure of unnecessary effort; it took me approximately 23 seconds and zero brainpower to type those above three sentences. The average employer could (and probably does, for those who still do this) staff that little email out to their current intern or secretary, who can easily send it en masse to however many applicants need to be notified. Therefore, it is just plain rude to not acknowledge an applicant’s desire for, and the often-considerable effort they put into, asking you for a job.
Rejection is a fact of life. I can handle rejection. What I can’t handle is a higher-stakes combination of being stood up by a date without a plausible reason and being given the cold shoulder by a group of middle school girls for no reason. Believe it or not, many of us have been rejected before, in ways more painful than by a job. Yes, it can be disappointing, frustrating, heartbreaking, and may even draw tears, but rejection is not always a bad thing, and can definitely make you a stronger person. So, dear employers, the next time the job application time of year rolls ‘round, please, oh please, if you’re going to reject me, just. reject. me.

The mushrooming number of undergraduates partaking in unpaid internships—up from nine percent in 1992 to 83 percent in 2008—has led many, including President Obama’s Labor Department, to question the legality and the advantages of such employment. Critics argue that the rise of unpaid internships has led to increased socioeconomic disparity, as lower-income students cannot sacrifice a summer salary to participate in such programs and are thus handicapped in the later race for post-collegiate jobs.
However, unpaid internships confer numerous benefits on employers and interns alike. All that President Obama’s restricting them will do is rob most students of valuable employment experiences while providing no added opportunity to low-income students. That said, many unpaid internships are indeed in violation of existing law, and the law therefore must be revamped to cement the legality of these internships.
Federal regulations that dictate which organizations can and cannot offer unpaid work do little to protect students from labor exploitation and much to deny them opportunity. Currently, an internship must meet six criteria to be legally unpaid. While most of these criteria are sensible enough, one that should be repealed is the stipulation that an internship must offer experience replicable at a vocational school or an academic institution, thus precluding a large number of industries from offering unpaid internships and limiting opportunities for jobseekers. Another worthy of repeal mandates that the employer cannot profit from intern labor. The latter criterion is the most often violated, demonstrating that interns view it as a fair trade to contribute to their employers’ profit margins in exchange for valuable work experience
Those who assert that employers exploit hapless students should recall that these very employers give many disadvantaged students the opportunity to develop a practical understanding of their desired field. They should also consider the possibility that internships are not merely superficial resume lining but often are a means of gaining nonreplicable hands-on experience, skills, and familiarity that students need in order to be hired full-time.
If employers were to heed the Obama administration’s wishes and honor the existing laws nominally banning unpaid internships, the number of opportunities available to students would dramatically decrease. Unpaid jobs would not suddenly change into paid ones; especially in this economy, the jobs would just go away. There is a reason why small companies with little capital are more likely to offer unpaid internships than the capital-laden behemoths of Wall Street.
Some opponents of unpaid internships argue that only non-profit companies should be allowed to hire interns, since they theoretically do not benefit economically from their interns’ labor. While many non-profits contribute admirably to the public good, this proposal is needlessly biased against those with interests outside of the non-profit sphere. The fact that an organization may profit from its services does not make it exploitative and evil. Doctors, for example, often practice for profit.
It is simply not the business of the government to cast normative judgments on different kinds of internships, be they profit versus non-profit or paid versus unpaid. Enforcing the ban on these internships, would even the playing field, but it would do so by reducing opportunity for all. Equality need not be bought at the expense of opportunity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tiger Woods is back. At least, Tiger Woods the golfer is back, roaming the fairways of Augusta National, where he is the betting favorite to win his 15th career major title at The Masters this week. Whether Tiger Woods the institution can ever return is still an open question.
Since he crashed his Cadillac into a fire hydrant last November—supposedly in an attempt to escape his golf club-wielding wife—Woods has taken one of the more dramatic nosedives in recent memory. With every turn, the story of his epic string of infidelities grew more sordid: sex with cocktail waitresses, sex with porn stars, sex on Ambien, and, most recently, sex with his next-door neighbor’s college-aged daughter. Important aspects of Tiger’s brand have suffered irreparable damage—the image of Woods as a paragon of discipline, mental toughness, and self-control that made him an ideal pitchman for corporate America is gone for good. Unsurprisingly, Tiger’s stable of sponsors has thinned accordingly, as everyone from Gatorade to Accenture has bid goodbye to the hapless golfer.
But one company has stood by him: Nike, a firm that is no stranger to controversy, refuses to write Woods off. Displaying its characteristic marketing savvy, the athletic powerhouse released a commercial featuring Tiger on the eve of his Master’s return, which has since enjoyed a flood of free publicity.
Rather than eschew discussion of Woods’s collapse, the ad engages directly with its star’s troubles. Filmed in black and white, the spot features Tiger staring into a camera that slowly zooms towards his sullen face. Meanwhile, a recording of the golfer’s dead father, Earl, plays in the background. “Tiger, I am more prone to be inquisitive, to promote discussion,” dad says. “I want to find out what your thinking was. I want to find out what your feelings are. And did you learn anything?” Tiger blinks under the weight of his guilt, a modern-day Hamlet confronted with his father’s ghost. The image fades to black as a Nike swoosh fills the screen.
Many have criticized Nike for its tawdry exploitation of family drama to sell shoes. And yet the commercial is undeniably powerful. Woods looks vulnerable, human—something that often eluded him even at his peak. He is recast from philandering athlete to prodigal son, ashamed to have let down dad.
Nike has not revealed what Earl Woods was originally discussing in the audio clip used for the advertisement, but his words present an interesting approach to his son’s troubles—one that contrasts sharply with the tone adopted by most other commentators.
On Wednesday, Billy Payne, Chairman of the Augusta National Golf Club, publicly admonished Woods in a press conference. Calling Tiger’s conduct “egregious,” Payne stated that Woods’s “future will never again be measured only by his performance against par, but measured by the sincerity of his efforts to change.”
This is the consensus—that Tiger is a deviant, a sinner, someone who needs to bring his conduct in line with notions of acceptable sexual behavior before he can think of acquiring any more athletic glory. Writing in The Washington Post, Thomas Boswell asserted that for Woods to “sin big and win big” by capturing a Masters title this week would be an affront to the justice of the universe.
The power of this puritanical camp has compelled Tiger to undergo a four-month-long mea culpa highlighted by a 45-day trip to sex rehab and a rediscovery of his Buddhist roots. Following the script perfectly, Woods has renounced himself in a flurry of tears and contrition.
I can’t help but feel for him. There is something sinister in the public shaming of anyone who dares transgress notions of bourgeois respectability, whether he be world-class golfer or influential politician. The obsession with holding our “role models” to particular standards of sexual conduct reflects an ugly, moralistic strain that holds too much sway over American public life.
Nike’s ad is effective because it reframes the entire scandal in the way it should be viewed. Tiger is a man with family problems. He should feel ashamed to face his father, not to take up a golf club.
The Masters is often associated with the coming of spring, as the azalea bushes of Augusta National supposedly suffuse viewers across the country with warmth and the promise of renewal. The symbolism couldn’t be more appropriate in this case. It’s been a long winter for Tiger Woods. Maybe now the nation is ready to move past its moralism and into the light.
One of the cruel realities of golf is that when 100 men head into a tournament, 99 emerge as losers. But one wins. So go get ‘em, Tiger.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We should study cultures other than the West, but not for the reason many students think.
The reason they give is we must be up-to-date. “[W]e are now two thousand years removed from the fall of Rome,” The Harvard Crimson opined, “and the academic occupations of modern scholars should necessarily be different from those of the ancients.” Harvard College agrees. Its website says, “The Program in General Education…[links] the arts and sciences with the 21st century world that students will face.” Our task, it seems, is to make sense of the here and now.
My quibble with this attitude is it mistakes the here and now for the one and only. Despite air-conditioning and iPods, our academic objective remains the same: to answer the question, “How should I live?” When we force our curriculum to be up-to-date, we forget that this question is debatable.
A debatable question has alternative answers. Unfortunately, many students see just one: modernity. Sure, they read Aristotle, but they see him as a step in the march of progress, not as a destination. “[N]o serious conservative can compare the modern world to ancient times, or today’s America to that of the 1950s, and honestly long for a restoration,” Sam Barr wrote in The Harvard Independent. “There might be some good traditions that we ought to bring back…But an argument has to be made for each…Nothing is good just because it’s old.”
I agree with Barr, but with one addition: Nothing is good just because it is new, either. The proper judge of these competing answers is reason. Here, some students’ stomachs churn. If reason is to judge alternative lifestyles, then it will favor some over others. This approach sounds like Western philosophy. It sounds like Western imperialism. “There are good courses and bad courses in Western philosophy. In the past, some courses told you your country had all the answers and you should go fight in World War I,” Professor Werner Sollors, chair of the Standing Committee on Ethnic Studies, told me.
I share this worry. But the fact that people misused reason in the past should not prevent us from using it today. We already do. On the Voice’s blog, Noice, Kathleen French enumerated antiquity’s faults: “slavery…Women not being able to vote…Ruthless imperialism.” She judged antiquity to be inferior to modernity for the former failed to recognize humanity’s inherent freedom. She was correct, but she also made a judgment based on reason.
Such a judgment promotes studies of other cultures; it does not discourage them. For if all cultures are equally reasonable, why bother? “If you imagine that you live on a cultural island where everything that matters is going on, you don’t care much about the other islands,” Sollors said. Under chauvinism, you think your island is all there is. Under relativism, you know there are other islands, but you are blasé; you get as much sunlight as they do.
Modern scholars have the same goal as ancient philosophers: to find the good life. “All fields in the arts and sciences emerged from philosophy,” said Sollors. So students should remember the premise of philosophy: Our civilization is inadequate. Socrates, the first political philosopher, began his quest for the good life after the Delphic oracle declared him the wisest man on earth. According to the city’s religion, Socrates should have been satisfied; the all-knowing god had spoken. Yet he questioned this authority because he discovered that the people—and thus the gods they worshipped—were ignorant. His city did not have all the answers.
As students, we pick up where Socrates left off. We study other cultures because we know the West is inadequate. It does not have all the answers. Similarly, modernity does not have all the answers; it should justify its assumptions about humanity as much as antiquity. Modernity assumes that all lifestyles are equally reasonable so that people can live in peace. In that peace, each individual is free to seek the good life as he sees it.
Students—particularly those with a liberal education—also seek the good life. But they should know that their search requires them to question the very assumptions under which they live.

More Harvard Square businesses have announced in the past month that they will accept Crimson Cash, a debit-based account that allows University affiliates to make purchases using their Harvard ID cards.
The new locations include Berk’s Shoes, Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe, Café of India, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Gnomon Copy, Harvest Co-op Markets, OM Restaurant and Lounge, and Shabu-Ya Restaurant.
Crimson Cash first entered the Square in 2003, when five local businesses began accepting the debit system by student demand.
According to Berk’s manager David Dasilva, his store adopted Crimson Cash to facilitate shopping for its customers after a 30-year presence in the Square.
“It’s always better to offer people who shop here other ways to buy things,” Dasilva said. “It’s easier for the consumer. It’s probably easier for the parents too. It’s easy for all of us, really.”
OM Restaurant signed up for the Crimson Cash program about a month ago, though their card-swiping machine only started working recently.
Solmon M. Chowdhury, the owner of OM, said that the restaurant adopted Crimson Cash because the majority of its clientele comprises Harvard faculty and students.
But he also said that he had placed several ads in local newspapers including The Crimson, before any customers made payments using Crimson Cash. Despite a slow start, he said that OM hopes to see 7 to 10 percent of all purchases paid for with Crimson Cash.
Several students said that the availability to use Crimson Cash would not affect their shopping—but the ability to use Board Plus would be an incentive to shop at certain businesses in the Square, they added.
“Honestly I don’t make any purchasing decisions based on Crimson Cash,” Micahel R. McKellar ’10 said. “I only put Crimson Cash on there for things like laundry services.”
Harvard worked in conjunction with the Harvard Square Business Association to push for the expansion, according to Harvard University Dining Services spokeswoman Crista Martin.
To use Crimson Cash, businesses have to pay a $175 one-time fee for equipment costs and 5 percent of any purchases made with Crimson Cash.

Several professors at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have taken a novel approach to teaching physics—cooking in class.
Using cooking techniques as physical demonstrations of scientific phenomena has garnered popularity among Harvard’s science professors as a way to make course subject material more accessible for a wider range of students.
Physics professor David A. Weitz—one of the creators of the new General Education course on cooking to be offered next fall, “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter”—described the blend of making meringue and studying soft-matter physics.
“You start with egg whites, a liquid, and you mix in air, a gas, and you end up with a solid,” Weitz said. “We try to figure out why that happens and understand it.”
The new course is just one incarnation of the food-science trend at Harvard.  Every year, SEAS offers a popular holiday lecture series, including topics such as “The Sweet Science of Chocolate” and “Squishy, Gooey, Stretchy: The Science of Making Pizza.”
“Promoting scientific literacy is important,” said Amy C. Rowat, a postdoctoral fellow who works in Weitz’ lab. “Students who have very little background in biological physics can relate to cooking.”
Rowat writes in her “Science and Food” blog that food is “an ideal medium to engage people in science: everyone eats.” She adds that various dishes exemplify scientific concepts ranging from phase transitions to fermentation.
Additionally, incorporating food in physics classes can raise the awareness of important health and nutrition concepts, Rowat said.
“I think there is a trend towards knowing and understanding more about the food we eat, ranging from sustainability to health and nutrition,” Rowat said.
Weitz added that he simply hopes the course’s entertaining approach will better engage students who may not have a background in science.
“Cooking is a creative art, and science also takes a great deal of creativity—as scientists we try to be as creative as we can,” Weitz said. “My motivation is to teach people science, but to make it real and exciting.”

A treatment accidentally discovered in the laboratory of physics professor Eric Mazur has the potential to vastly increase the effectiveness of silicon.
The newly discovered “black silicon” is created through a laser treatment inside a chamber filled with sulfur gases—a procedure that allows silicon to absorb a larger fraction of the solar spectrum, according to Meng-Ju Sher, a physics research assistant.
Unlike regular silicon, black silicon can absorb the infrared region of the light spectrum as well absorb visible light much more efficiently.
Black silicon has practical applications, such as cameras and night vision goggles, but Kenneth C. Hammond ’12—who works in Mazur’s lab—hopes to create more efficient solar cells with the new substance.
Though regular silicon does “a fairly good job” of absorbing the solar spectrum, black silicon is able to absorb a much greater percentage, and Hammond said researchers hypothesize that black silicon could create a more efficient solar cell.
“When you’re building a solar cell, you want to look for a substance that can absorb most of what the sun gives you,” Hammond said.
Mazur’s team is currently seeking to expand silicon’s absorption range even further—a task that requires a better understanding of how the sulfur gases affect the silicon and transform it into black silicon.
The researchers are also exploring the capabilities and limitations of black silicon, while Mazur’s company SiOnyx is working on prototypes of practical applications of the material.
The Harvard researchers had discovered black silicon by accident while Mazur was researching the properties of platinum and semi-conductors. Mazur had arbitrarily chosen silicon to study—a random vial of sulfur later, black silicon was born.
“I think it shows that serendipity has a role in science,” Mazur said. “If you experiment, you’re bound to discover surprises that nature has in store for us.”
“Some people think of science as a straight paved road to a goal but that’s not the case,” he added. “Often it’s the most expected things that give the biggest surprises.”

Over the past week, members of Harvard Men Against Rape have been encouraging other men to don the white ribbon as a symbol of their support for the fight against sexual assault.
Their efforts are part of the nationwide White Ribbon Campaign recognized at Harvard this week, organized in concert with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response for Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April.
“The Campaign is a visible sign of men’s support against violence against women,” OSAPR Prevention Specialist Seth D. Avakian said. “Our goal is to help men become part of the solution instead of part of the problem by engaging them as active bystanders.”
Director of OSAPR Sarah A. Rankin expanded on the role of the active bystander, noting that men’s involvement is crucial to preventing sexual assault.
“Being a bystander is about educating yourself and knowing what you can do when someone is about do something risky or stupid,” she said. “Most men are typically going to respond better when it’s another man challenging their ideas that it’s acceptable to have sex with a girl who’s unconscious.”
Matthew P. Vollenweider ’11, a member of HMAR, also said that making other men think about the issue of sexual assault is a primary goal and added that he had observed two principle reactions during this week’s Campaign.
“Some people think it’s good that we’re talking about this in a public setting, and other people say that it’s a noncontroversial issue,” Vollenweider added.
The latter group of people questioned the need to raise awareness for sexual violence, arguing that its occurrence is already acknowledged as a problem.
But Vollenweider said that the Campaign still made students stop and think.
“If we weren’t out here talking about it, you wouldn’t have just thought about it,” he said.
Abbas Jaffer, a Divinity School student active in HMAR, said that many men become involved in assault prevention because they are close to women who have been affected by sexual violence.
“Even a partial connection can give men the impulse to advocate against sexual violence,” he said. “When they see something beyond theoretical ideas and statistics, something that touches their hearts, they want to do right.”
According to Jaffer, members of final clubs, fraternities, and athletic teams who are involved with both HMAR and the Campaign are taking a proactive approach to combating the stigma that much sexual assault is perpetrated by men in these organizations.
“This is a stereotype where a lot of anxiety about sexual violence comes from,” Jaffer said. “But their strong and sincere presence makes me optimistic.”
Jaffer said that a limited time frame is the most challenging aspect of efforts like the week-long White Ribbon Campaign and the few weeks of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
“We want to start a continuing effort and conversation by thinking of creative ways to engage more students on this issue outside of this one month of events,” he said.
But Jaffer added that the Campaign has already reached a lot of men throughout the week.
“We’re almost out of white ribbons,” he said.

UCLA film professor Chon A. Noriega examined the life and works of the Latino artist Raphael Montañez Ortiz in the latest of the Latin American Leventritt Lecture Series held at the Sackler Museum last night.
Noriega, who is the Director of UCLA’s Chicano Studies Research Center, highlighted Ortiz as an often under-appreciated influence on modern art.
“Ortiz is an artist who is missing from art history, and is ... considered to be foundational for post-1968 avant-garde art in the United States,” Noriega said.
He added that Ortiz’s exclusion from major historical accounts underscores the gap in representation of artists of color in American art historiography.
Although Ortiz worked in all genres—producing recycled films and works in painting, sculpture, and performance—he was especially famous in the early 1960s for a series of works he called “Archaeological Finds.” In these works, he peeled away the outer layers of man-made objects such as mattresses, chairs, sofas, and pianos.
At the event, Noriega also discussed Ortiz’s life in reverse chronology and emphasized the search for identity that is central to Mexican-American work.
But according to Noriega, Ortiz has distinguished himself from other Latino-American artists in his concern for emotional roots.
Noriega said that this focus inspired the genesis of primal screen therapy, which influenced psychotherapy.
The creator of El Museo del Barrio in New York City—the first Latino art museum in the United States—Ortiz is known for his involvement in the destructionist movement, which attempted to address what it saw as the social detachment of the post-War avant-garde.
Noriega also discussed Ortiz’s writings, referencing Ortiz’s philosophy that “[destructivists] do not pretend to play at God’s happy game of creation. On the contrary, theirs is a response to the prevalent will to kill.”
“[Noriega] is a perfect example of how this particular field has grown in importance due to the efforts of a particular individual,” said Associate Harvard Art Museum Curator Mary S. Enriquez.
“It’s fascinating,” said Cheryl J. Vince, who attended the event. “The rage, in some ways, that comes from not knowing who you are, I think, feeds a lot of that destructivism in art that [Ortiz] made his life of expression.”

Vijay Jain ’11 has found a medium in which he can combine his two loves, chemistry and physics—he researches the effect of magnets on chemicals on the nano scale, looking to see how physical forces can influence chemical reactivity.
Chemistry and physics professor Adam E. Cohen ’01, who heads the lab where Jain works, said that the project was inspired by a phenomenon on a larger scale—birds’ ability to navigate using the magnetic field of the earth. While it is unclear how the birds detect the magnetic field, some scientists have suggested that a biochemical process in their bodies is affected by these forces.
“This is surprising because most magnetic fields interact very weakly with matter,” Cohen said. “Normally we don’t think about magnetic fields affecting chemistry.”
Jain, who is a chemistry and physics concentrator, is experimenting on the level of individual electrons. He has been attempting to use magnetic nanoparticles to catalyze chemical reactions, thereby increasing the rate at which the reaction occurs. He said that this area of research allowed him to combine disciplines without obvious connections, such as organic chemistry and quantum mechanics.
Though real world applications for these experiments are nebulous at the moment, according to Jain, he added that it would be interesting to gain a better understanding of how enzymes operate at a subatomic level.
Jain, who grew up in Long Island, said that he has been immersed in the sciences since childhood, since his parents worked in medicine and chemistry.
“Our dinner table discussions were certainly not like, ‘What’s going on on TV?’” said Jain, an inactive Crimson editor. “It’s more like, ‘Oh, do you really understand how your food is being digested and do you understand what’s going through your intestines right now?’”
In high school, he and a friend worked in a lab to build a biosensor to detect different biomolecules. Though Jain said he initially thought he would concentrate in engineering, he soon realized he preferred the basic sciences.
Jain said he plans to continue research in the sciences. He said that he was most interested in finding solutions to problems in society and the world that can be resolved using the tools of chemistry and physics.
Cohen said that Jain has been an “extraordinarily dedicated” student in the year since he joined the team of researchers, coming in to run experiments at all hours of day and night.
“By now he’s basically just like any of the grad students in the lab,” Cohen said.

Harvard has instituted a new policy that requires all science students conducting research to receive ethics training, University officials say.
Within the next month, the University will finalize plans for meeting the new responsible research training requirements mandated by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation for all researchers, including undergraduates, supported by NIH or NSF funding, according to Harvard’s Chief Research Compliance Officer Mark Barnes.
The University—which received two-thirds of its $559 million of federal funding from the two agencies in the fiscal year ending 2009—has purchased a subscription to an online ethics education course and is considering incorporating ethics training in regular coursework for undergraduates, Barnes said.
“We’re using this as an opportunity to put into place responsible conduct that is broader than what is required,” Barnes said.
“These requirements ... are really only outlining what is good practice anyway, that individuals who are engaged in research need to have education about responsible conduct of research,” he said.
To help implement the new policy, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research has created a task force comprising representatives from the four schools most affected by the change—the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Public Health, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Daniel I. Wikler, a professor of population ethics at the School of Public Health, said that teaching research ethics is increasingly important as the number of ethical violations increases nationwide.
“There’s kind of an epidemic of misconduct now,” Wikler said. “Often now we see situations where something bad happens and say, ‘Look—if we’d had a program in place where people know what to do in these circumstances, it would have been better.’”
Wikler, who co-teaches a course on ethical issues in health research, added that he thinks even basic ethics training at the science schools would be beneficial for students.
“One of the reasons misconduct is causing such consternation is because when someone has these charges raised against them, it can put a big cloud over their career for a while, and it’s often extremely hard to clear themselves,” he said. “This training is really in the self-interest of the trainee.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 10, 2010
An earlier version of the April 10 news article "Harvard To Institute Research Ethics Training" incorrectly stated that the University will finalize plans for meeting the new responsible research training requirements for "grant recipients conducting experiements on animals." In fact, the new policy applies to all researchers, including undergraduates, supported by NIH or NSF funding. The subheadline has also been changed to reflect the inaccuracy.

Life expectancy disparities among people of different socio-economic, geographic, and racial backgrounds can be explained by different modifiable habits and health issues, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health reported last month.
The study cited smoking, high blood pressure, obesity, and high glucose levels as the principal agents contributing to discrepancies in life expectancy and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancers within these different groups, which were dubbed the “Eight Americas.”
Smoking is a “modifiable” factor with the largest impact on an individual’s longevity. The habit subtracts 2.5 years from men’s life expectancies and 1.5 years from women’s, according to the study, which was led by Goodarz Danaei, a research fellow at the school’s department of epidemiology.
Among the various ethnic groups, Southern rural African-Americans ran the largest deficit in life expectancy due to these health issues, according to the study, which was published in PloS Medicine.
The team’s recent work builds upon Danaei’s report in April 2009 that determined the number of people who died from the preventable causes like smoking and high blood pressure.
In a 2009 press release, Danaei called the prevalence of premature deaths due to modifiable risk factors “shocking”—a predicament that should motivate a “serious look” at the efficacy of the public health system.

During a talk on diversity in higher education yesterday, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds advised graduate students to establish a wide range of mentors who can support them in their academic endeavors.
A three-member panel, comprising three African Americans at different stages in their academic careers, offered a range of advice on how to overcome the difficulties of being an academic. They also extolled the virtues of the occupation.
Hammonds encouraged students to actively search for advisers—regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sex—who can help them pursue their academic interests.
“I would not be here without mentors,” she said. “You have to have them.”
She said an academic commitment to a field of study could sometimes serve as a powerful bond between two people and could bring together otherwise dissimilar individuals.
Besides Hammonds, who is also a professor of History of Science and of African American Studies, two other panelists participated—Brandon M. Terry ’05, a fourth year doctoral student in political science and African American studies at Yale; and Christopher Wheat, an assistant professor of technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and strategic management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The panelists also emphasized the “autonomy” of academic work.
“No one’s asking me why I am doing [the work that I am doing,” Wheat said.
On the other hand, Terry pointed to one of the downsides of the freedom provided to graduate students.
It can be “very different” than studying as an undergraduate, he said, adding that life as a graduate student “can be a sort of abyss of freedom.”
Hammonds explained how her peers helped motivate her while she was working. Her group of peers would expect each other to write five pages of their dissertations each day, she said.
Sometimes she would be done by noon, other times it took all day, but her support group helped her stay dedicated, she added.
Shirley Sun, a research assistant at the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research, said the talk helped her realize the importance of being assertive when looking for a support group.
Coming from Los Angeles as a Chinese-American, Sun said she had been “reluctant” to go to others for advice, asking herself, “How could they understand me?”
But, she added, the panel—which took place at the Office of Career Services and was co-sponsored by several organizations on campus, including the Harvard College Women’s Center—encouraged her to be more open in her search for a diverse range of mentors.

Harvard and MIT researchers received $2.1 million in grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last Thursday to study the effects of climate change on public health and local ecosystems.
The grants—which are part of $17 million awarded to universities nationwide—will fund two projects at Harvard, the first of which will examine when and where pollen allergies are most likely to increase as a result of changing regional climate conditions.
In collaboration with a team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Harvard researchers aim to develop models and maps that will predict when and where allergy “hotspots” will occur in New England, according to the EPA press release.
Additionally, Harvard was awarded a second grant to improve an existing model to predict fires in shrub and grasslands in California, the Southwest, and other forest areas. The team will also work with NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies to assess the effects of climate change on the length of the wildfire season in North America.
“Emissions from wildfires can have deleterious effects on air quality. As climate change brings higher temperatures and perturbs rainfall patterns over the next few decades, the effects on wildfires and regional air quality could be large,” the Harvard/NASA GISS team said in the press release.
MIT researchers will work with Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, a Boston-based regional air pollution control organization, to assess the global and local impact of climate change on air quality by 2050. The study will analyze the costs and benefits of transportation technologies, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and bio-fuels, and their impact on both the economy and global health.
Researchers at Harvard, UMass Amherst, and MIT did not return requests for comment yesterday.

The Harvard Faculty Club was closed for a second time on Tuesday, amid renewed guest complaints of illnesses in the wake of a norovirus infection that affected Club guests just a week before.
During the two days in which the Club was reopened, approximately 100 people reported becoming ill, according to The Boston Globe.
Norovirus is a highly contagious gastrointestinal virus that is spread by direct contact with contaminated persons or objects, according to the University Health Services Web site. Some of the symptoms include vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and minor fever.
Exactly one week prior to Tuesday’s closing, several guests complained about such symptoms. Their illnesses were eventually linked to norovirus, and the Club was immediately closed.
A highly-specialized cleaning crew was subsequently hired to thoroughly disinfect the entire facility, said Harvard University Dining Services spokeswoman Crista Martin. The crew also screened Club employees for the virus.
These measures were deemed sufficient by the Cambridge Public Health Department, and the Club was then allowed to recommence services on April 4, Martin said.
Despite all these measures, the virus resurfaced two days later. Neither University nor public health officials have been able to determine the cause of either incidents, Martin noted.
She added that a slew of similar norovirus-like illnesses have been reported in the greater Boston area but that there have not been any such reports from other Harvard dining areas.
UHS Communications Officer Jennifer B. Anderson said she still encourages Harvard community members to take the necessary precautions to avoid getting the virus. According to the UHS Web site, the most effective preventative measure is regular hand-washing, preferably with warm water and soap.
People who start exhibiting the aforementioned symptoms are advised to avoid dairy products, drink plenty of water, and sleep.
Club officials are still working with public health officials to identify and eliminate the source of the virus, according to a statement posted on their Web site.
The Club has yet to determine a reopening date, Martin said.

Electronic medical record systems alone may not be enough to improve the quality of care and drive down medical costs, Harvard researchers say.
The findings, published Tuesday in the journal Health Affairs, reveal modest improvements at best in health care quality and cost efficiency with the adoption of electronic medical records systems in U.S. hospitals.
The team, led by Harvard Medical School professor Catherine M. DesRoches, surveyed more than 3,000 U.S. community hospitals to assess factors such as inpatient costs and mortality and readmission rates.
Hospitals with comprehensive electronic health record systems were compared with those with no or basic electronic systems, and the team only found slight differences in areas such as length of stay and surgical infection prevention.
Overall, the researchers determined that the technological systems, as currently implemented, do not have a significant impact on improving care and reducing costs, DesRoches said.
“Having a system is not enough,” DesRoches added. “We can’t expect that hospitals are just going to plug these systems in, and suddenly you’re going to see large improvements. The systems are only going to be as good as how people are using them.”
Though President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus package authorized approximately $30 billion in grants and incentives to encourage hospitals and health care clinics across the nation to adopt electronic health record systems, DesRoches said that the study’s findings suggest that health care providers may not be using the new technology to its full potential.
Harvard School of Public Health professor Ashish K. Jha, who is the senior author of this paper, emphasized the importance of defining “meaningful use”—the federal standard used for providing financial incentives.
“Ensuring that hospitals use these systems in a robust way will be critical to obtaining value from the large investment that the nation is making in health information technology,” Jha said in a statement.
DesRoches added that the study’s findings should not deter future technological advances in keeping medical records.
“With the amount of attention and money that the federal government is putting into this issue, I don’t think we can do anything but move forward at this point,” Desroches said,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Radcliffe chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society has changed its selection process for the final round of senior elections into the organization, PBK officers announced earlier this week.
In past years, students who were in the top of their class in each of the three areas—humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences—would be invited to apply for each round of elections. But starting this year, the students under consideration for the final round during senior spring will not be subjected to an application process. In fact, they will not be notified of their candidacy.
Instead of having each senior spring candidate upload a transcript and provide two recommendations as candidates did in the first two rounds, this new election process will seek consultation from the director of undergraduate studies for each relevant department based on academic records obtained from the registrar.
According to Logan S. McCarty, the organization’s vice president, this new procedure arose from student and faculty concerns about the nature of the final senior election, where half the number of invited applicants find out a week before Commencement that they have not been elected into the society.
“It’s basically a small honor,” said Ann M. Blair, president of Harvard’s chapter. “The act of not getting it shouldn’t be marring the experience of graduating.”
Blair estimates that roughly 90 students will be selected of the approximately 180 candidates this spring, which, along with the 24 selected in spring of junior year and 48 selected in fall of senior year, will make up 10 percent of the graduating class.
Blair added that practical considerations also went into making this change.
The timing of these elections, McCarty said, has always come at a busy time for students and faculty, presenting a challenge to obtaining the letters of recommendation.
Though this new procedure would put less pressure on both students and faculty, it will not change the thinking behind this chapter’s selection process, McCarty added.
“Many schools’ Phi Beta Kappa is determined solely by grade point average, and we have long felt that that is a narrow viewpoint,” McCarty said. “We want to look at academic excellence more broadly. The level of difficulty and the breath of academic experience that they show is more than a simple numerical calculation. We still preserve all of that in this process.”
Some seniors who are already members of the society said they support the idea of only announcing the new additions before Commencement.
“I think it’s a positive thing not to let down half the people who are nominated,” said Anthony C. Speare ’10, a sociology concentrator and a marshall for the society.
As it currently stands, once undergraduates are elected, they may choose to partake in deliberations for future rounds of selection.
Under the new guidelines, however, students will not be able to participate in deliberations for senior spring elections.
Daniel M. Bear ’10, a molecular and cellular biology concentrator in Adams House, said he feels that there is not much difference in being able to make the decisions.
“It’s nice to be a part of the deliberations,” Bear said. “[But] both of those groups are extremely accomplished groups of students, and [it’s] an extremely high honor to be in each of those groups. It’s a tremendous honor to be elected no matter what.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 is no stranger to working with technology. The computer science major and self-termed “CS nerd” has been making Web sites since he was 10 years old.
“I was a fifth grader that thought it was incredibly cool to be able to put something together in a matter of minutes that people could then access all over,” Hysen says.
To a large extent, it is this same recognition of the wide-reaching capabilities of a Web site that now seems to be driving many of the projects organized by the UC this semester.
Since Hysen and UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 took office in December, the Council has introduced four new Web initiatives: UC Rooms, Crimsonlist, Crimson Forum, and a Harvard for Haiti donation site.
The Council also voted in March to fund an online study guide library, but ultimately put the project on hold pending a more thorough investigation of academic and ethical implications, according to Bowman.
Throughout the apparent successes and setbacks, the UC is making an effort to target the Harvard undergraduate community through a noticeably increased Web presence.
CAMPAIGN PROMISES
During last November’s UC election, Bowman and Hysen ran on the policy of “Bringing Harvard Online” and identified Hysen’s background in computer science as an advantage that set the pair apart, Hysen says.
As they brainstormed innovative ways to benefit the student body, many ideas seemed conducive to a Web-based approach.
“We were looking for things that the UC could do itself without much administrative approval and that wouldn’t cost that much,” Bowman says. “And we realized one great way to do this was through new online projects.”
For inspiration, the pair looked at student government initiatives at other schools, including Princeton and Yale. Bowman says that these schools appeared “way ahead of Harvard in the online department,” noting that this trend might be the result of structural differences.
“Princeton’s student government has a whole team of online programmers—we have Harvard Computer Society,” he says. “It’s just organized differently.”
Princeton Undergraduate Student Government President Michael Yaroshefsky wrote in an e-mailed statement that Princeton’s USG “is constantly adding new features and upgrading current [applications].”
Last Wednesday, Princeton’s USG launched an “Integrated Course Engine”—referred to as “ICE 2.0”—which will allow users to read course descriptions, access student course reviews, and look at potential classes in a weekly schedule format all on the same site.
Yaroshefsky said the Princeton USG is also currently in the process of assembling several Web applications—including an undergraduate room guide and a textbook exchange site—into a single, accessible hub to be called “TigerApps.”
Hysen says Yale currently has a similar portal called “Yale Station” and that the UC eventually hopes to consolidate its online applications in the same way.
According to Bowman, the creation of “one online place” will help facilitate the accessibility and longevity of the UC’s multiple Web applications.
SMOOTH CONNECTEDNESS
In turning two of their newest online projects into reality, the UC has worked closely this semester with Legata, an independent, student-run company founded by Sasank Konda ’12, Kane Hsieh ’12, and Calvin McEachron ’12.
Legata—whose name alludes to the musical term to express smooth connectedness—currently hosts Crimson Forum, a message board site that aims to facilitate undergraduate discussion on a wide variety of topics, as well as Crimsonlist, Harvard’s version of the online classifieds Web site Craigslist.
Bowman says both Legata and the UC came up with the idea for Crimsonlist and Crimson Forum independently around the same time, but decided to collaborate to avoid competing models.
Legata developed the technology for the two projects, while the UC has primarily worked to generate publicity among the student body, according to UC Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11.
The UC also supports Crimson Forum by providing moderators to ensure the accuracy of information and the appropriateness of language on the Web site.
But Konda, who is also a Crimson business editor, emphasizes that Legata is independent from the UC.
“The UC and Legata have entered into a nontraditional relationship, where the former is a nonpaying client of the latter,” Konda says. “We are providing services to them for the good of the student body.”
While the UC did not pay McEachron, Konda, and Hsieh, who is also a Crimson photo editor, the UC hired student programmer Punit N. Shah ’12 to develop a UC Rooms site for $550, which is “incredibly low for a well done Web app like that” Hysen says.
Hysen coded the Harvard for Haiti Web site in February, but adds that while he helps supervise all the projects, he “doesn’t have time to build an entire site from scratch anymore.”
‘A SHIFT IN CULTURE’
Shah says that most student groups have been pleased with the convenience afforded by these new sites.
“If you build it, they will come,” he says. “The technology exists, and there is no reason for students not to have access to that technology to make their lives easier.”
Such seems to be the case with UC Rooms, which launched Mar. 23 and has since received 1,100 hits.
Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12 says that the site has earned positive feedback from all the student groups he has been in contact with, including the Institute of Politics, the Chinese Student Association, the Harvard Opportunes, the Society of Arab Students, the Harvard Black Student Association, and multiple PBHA program directors.
“It’s really refreshing to see, and it’s a really huge boost for us,” BSA President Spencer H. Hardwick ’11, an inactive Crimson news editor, told The Crimson when UC Rooms launched.
The Harvard for Haiti Web site experienced similar success in coordinating Haiti relief efforts between the UC and House Committees, as well as serving as the home page for the Harvard for Haiti Benefit Concert in February.
According to Hysen, around $25,000 was raised from Harvard affiliates through the site.
“I think it was all a great success, and I’m really glad the UC put the site together,” says B.A. Sillah ’12, the concert’s executive producer.
However, one of the more recent initiatives, Crimson Forum, hasn’t been “terribly successful” so far, according to Hysen. The site’s most recent post was on Mar. 22, more than two weeks ago.
Hysen says ensuring Crimson Forum’s success is a challenge because it represents “a shift in culture” from one that is currently “dominated by active House lists.”
The UC will aim to use the site to connect with pre-freshmen in the coming weeks so that current Harvard students can answer their questions, Hysen adds.
Crimsonlist might also be experiencing a lull similar to Crimson Forum, but, according to Fabrizio, this is understandable.
“I think that Crimsonlist will be much bigger in students’ awareness at the end of the year for senior sales,” she says, adding that the UC will make a renewed publicity push for the Web site at that time.
A VISION UNREALIZED
But in addition to the four implemented Web sites, another major component of the UC’s increased online initiative this spring has yet to come to fruition: an online class study guide library.
In February, the Council passed legislation to fund the creation of a study guide library‑only to suspend the effort a week later.
The re-vote was spawned by several academic and ethical concerns and an apparent lack of administrative approval.
“I think students working together to produce study guides can be a wonderful thing; I think students making use of a study guide produced two years ago is an awful thing,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris says. “It’s an expression of a certain kind of indifference to learning... a certain kind of laziness.”
But Bowman says that he views the study guide library as a means to give the same resources to all students. To Bowman, the initiative to take information spread out over campus and consolidate it in one place for all undergrads is a philosophy that has driven many of the other UC online initiatives.
Bowman, Hysen, and Harris will continue discussions on collaborative alternatives to the initial study guide idea, such as a student Wikipedia site where students could work together to craft entries.
MORE IN THE WORKS
According to Fabrizio, the UC will next work towards revamping of the events calendar currently available to students through the my.harvard.edu portal.
“It’s just a little overwhelming at this point,” Hysen says, adding that the UC is working with C.S. 50 lecturer David J. Malan ’99 to improve the site’s interface and search filters.
To incentivize student groups to make use of the my.harvard.edu events calendar, the SRC will raffle three $100 prizes in the pool of student groups that have uploaded event information by the end of the day today.
In addition to the event calendar, the UC also has long-term plans to re-vamp the UC Web site in an effort to make the UC more accessible and transparent to students.
The UC currently has a blog—entitled UC Juicy—a Twitter account, and Facebook page to connect with students on the Web.
Fabrizio says that the UC’s increased online presence is part of a larger push towards making the UC more relevant to the student body—a goal that also includes last week’s lacrosse tailgate and red Harvard shirt dispersal and the creation of the UC study breaks, which will pilot next week in Adams and Mather Houses.
“These online initiatives are really important, but they are not to replace face-to-face contact with UC reps,” Fabrizio says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The walls are bright pastels: green, periwinkle, red, and orange. In the center of the large room, two young children, joined by two Harvard undergraduates, laugh in unison, shaking a bag full of ice, cream, and vanilla extract and dancing to “Walk Like an Egyptian.”
This is the Harvard Allston Education Portal, a space that serves as a gateway for teaching and learning between the University and the community. The Portal, which is the brainchild of Director of Life Sciences Education Robert A. Lue, offers free mentoring and enrichment opportunities in science, math, writing, and public speaking for the neighborhood’s children, in addition to computer classes and a speaker series geared towards adults.
The Portal sits less than three blocks from a piece of land slated for the construction of the Allston Science Complex—a now desolate pit of concrete surrounded by scaffolding that has come to represent the tensions between Harvard and the community. But those involved with the Portal say that hostility between the neighborhood and the University seems to disappear at the Ed Portal’s glass doors.
‘BI-DIRECTIONAL DOORWAY’
The people interviewed for this article—Harvard administrators, the undergraduates who mentor children at the Portal, and parents who bring their children to learn in the one-story building—all echoed the same sentiment: The Education Portal is free from the tensions between the University and the community.
This is all the more surprising given the organization’s origins. Harvard created the Ed Portal in 2008 as a component of the legally-binding cooperation agreement that the City of Boston required the University to sign before it could break ground on the Allston Science Complex. As part of the agreement, Harvard pledged to distribute $25 million dollars over the next decade for community benefits.
But Lue, who created the Portal and now serves as its faculty director, says that the Portal is not intended to be a gesture of obligation. Instead, he says, it has served as a way for the community and the University to truly interact.
“I pitched the idea of the Education Portal as a really exciting opportunity to rethink how the community and the University come together,” Lue says. “It’s a bi-directional doorway, like a sandbox where the community and the University can collaborate and develop ongoing projects.”
In creating programming for the Ed Portal, Lue is advised by a committee that includes Allston residents so as to ensure that the space fulfills community needs.
And while disputes between the University and the community are largely absent from the project, Lue says December’s halt in construction on the Science Complex has had some negative effects on the Education Portal.
“I did have high hopes that when the building opened we would have access to facilities that would further support programming at the Portal,” Lue says.
MENTORING, NOT TUTORING
All the Harvard undergraduates who mentor children at the Ed Portal interviewed for this article say they have had positive experiences with the parents and children who they work with. Still, some mentioned the need to be mindful of tensions between the University and the community.
“As mentors, we all have to be aware of what’s going on,” says Sophie Rengarajan ’10, who has been mentoring at the Education Portal since it opened. “But once we’re inside the Portal we focus on science and nothing else.”
Qi Yu ’11, who has been mentoring for four semesters, echoes these sentiments.
“I’ve always had a good experience with the people of Allston,” Yu says. “The politics really stay outside of the Ed Portal.”
Lue emphasizes that the mentoring program is the heart of the Education Portal, where Harvard undergraduates work one on one and in small groups with first through 12th graders on math, science, writing, public speaking, and provide general homework help.
“It’s mentoring, not tutoring,” says Lue, adding that it is his hope that the undergraduates continue to work with the same students and families from semester to semester.
Each of the 17 mentors spends one afternoon a week at the Portal. Collectively, they work with more 90 local children.
Much of their work revolves around a discovery-based approach towards learning, with the children and the mentors designing and executing a variety of experiments.
Education Portal Coordinator Meaghan C. Fay also emphasizes the role the mentors have in fostering excitement about college among the young students it serves.
“It’s fantastic to have Harvard students introducing these kids to the idea of college at a very early age,” Fay says.
Many Allston residents say that the Ed Portal provides a valuable service.
Guoing Yan, the mother of a six-year-old boy who is mentored in science at the, says how much she enjoys the program.
“My son looks forward to this every week,” Yan says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Jean Yang ’08 arrived at Harvard in the fall of 2004, she was in many ways a typical, undecided freshman, contemplating concentrations ranging from economics to biology.
But after enrolling in CS50, Harvard’s introductory computer science class, she instantly developed a passion for the subject.
Yet in Yang’s early semesters of studying computer science, she faced challenges that she never expected. Having graduated from an all-girls high school, she was surprised to find herself in classes with fewer than 10 women, and she struggled with the persistent sense that she was unwelcome or unqualified.
“When you’re an undergraduate woman, and you don’t have a ton of self-confidence, you’re going to have to really assert yourself in a field where you’re being treated by others as if you don’t know anything,” Yang said.
Despite these difficulties, Yang decided to concentrate in computer science, and after graduating Magna Cum Laude in 2008, she is now pursuing her computer science Ph.D. at MIT.
But as some women interested in CS face similar challenges, few remain in the field long enough to experience the same success.
In fact, computer science is the most gender-skewed concentration offered at Harvard, with women comprising only 13 percent of undergraduate CS majors.
The proportion of female CS majors is similar at some of Harvard’s peer institutions—including Princeton, where it stands at 19 percent, and Stanford, where it is 14 percent.
But interviews with over a dozen women involved with computer science revealed no clear consensus on the issue. While some believe this disparity is due to the difficulties faced by female CS concentrators at Harvard, others say that they have found a welcoming environment in Harvard CS and ascribe the variance to experiences that women face prior to college.
AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP
According to statistics provided by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the gender imbalance within CS classes seems to grow with each subsequent course on the CS track.
While 34 percent of students in CS50 were female when the class was offered last fall, female enrollment in CS51 and CS61—the two classes that typically follow CS50—are 25 percent and 23 percent, respectively.
By the time students reach CS124, a class that usually comes later in the track, female enrollment drops to 18 percent.
Women are also more likely to concentrate in another coding-heavy field or to minor in CS than they are to actually concentrate in the subject.
According to data collected from the Registrar’s Office, 43 percent of students concentrating in Applied Math: Computer Science are female, 36 percent of students concentrating in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science track of the Engineering Sciences degree are female, and 25 percent of students pursuing a CS minor are female.
From this data, it seems that women are moderately likely to enroll in introductory CS courses. But subsequently, some women opt for CS-related concentrations or the CS minor, which require less intensive exposure to the subject, while most women abandon the field entirely.
AN EARLY START
Several undergraduate women involved in CS said that factors leading to the gender imbalance at Harvard include social pressures and men’s broader exposure to the topic in the time leading up to college.
“In high school, I think girls are more sensitive to peer pressure and don’t want to be perceived as ‘nerds,’” said Prajakta D. Jaju ’10, who has completed a secondary field in computer science.
Cansu A. Aydede ’11, who works as the head TF for CS50, said that the male “gamer” stereotype may also indirectly contribute to the gender skew.
“The people who come in with a strong CS background may be the types more interested in computer games...and so [they] may more often be boys than girls,” she said.
The high school disparity is evident among those who take the Advanced Placement Computer Science A and AB exams. According to data from the CollegeBoard, 84 percent of test-takers were male when the test was given in 2006.
According to many women interviewed for this article, the fact that females often come to Harvard with a weaker CS background leads fewer of them to try out the subject at all.
“There’s no real encouragement for women who are considering CS but aren’t sure,” said Nivedita Sarnath ’12, a current computer science concentrator who is switching to Applied Math for reasons unrelated to the gender skew.
And even for those women who do enroll in CS courses, some fear that they are somehow unprepared for the challenges of the concentration.
“I think there is always a sense that you are playing catch-up,” said CS concentrator Lee E. Evangelakos ’11.
WORKING TOGETHER
Multiple women also pointed to gender differences in college work habits that may also deter undergraduate women from concentrating in CS.
One widely reported issue was the difficulty in finding partners for problem sets in early CS classes.
“Freshman year, I found it really difficult to find people to work with,” Yang said, adding that she believed many males “wound up [living] with other guys who did math or physics or CS, and they all worked together,” but she lacked this option because her roommates were all studying humanities.
Sarnath agreed with Yang: “It is still true that guys tend to work with guys, and that makes it a little more difficult if you don’t know any other girls in your class, to find someone to work with.”
Some women also noted that collaborating on problem sets in larger groups often brought out gender-related differences in work habits and communication styles.
Evangelakos said that her interactions with male CS concentrators had sometimes led her to doubt her own qualifications.
“Even the guys who you take all your classes with will sometimes try to explain things to you that you already know,” Evangelakos said.
Jaju agreed, adding that group work could also lead to social discomfort.
“A lot of times, I felt like I didn’t fit in when people would have conversations about technology or gadgets [or] video games,” Jaju said. “Classes were fine and the work was fine, but talking in problem set groups made it hard to relate.”
FINDING CONFIDENCE
Several female CS concentrators said that they were able to cope with these issues and enjoy their coursework simply by having a high degree of confidence in their own abilities as students.
Batool Z. Ali ’10, a CS concentrator who will be working at Google after graduation, said she has “never felt disadvantaged” due to her gender but added that she is an “in-your-face kind of person.”
And Neena Kamath ’11, who plans to pursue a Ph.D. in CS, said that there are “many advantages to being in the field as a woman,” but that she, too, has a “strong personality.”
Both women acknowledged that the gender imbalance could be more intimidating for women who entered Harvard with less faith in their abilities.
“Walking in, you need to be able to deal with the fact that you are going to be in the minority,” Kamath said.
And even among women who reported few problems with feeling like “the only girl in the room,” some still expressed a desire to see more women in their classes.
“All the people I’ve worked with have been pretty much male. It doesn’t really bother me,” said Tiffany J. Au ’12, an engineering concentrator who is considering a switch to CS. “But it would definitely be nice to have more females.”
LOOKING FOR A SOLUTION
Despite the difficulties that some of them have faced, nearly every undergraduate woman interviewed for this article stressed that she had found the faculty in the CS department to be welcoming and supportive.
Several CS professors indicated that encouraging more women to study the subject was among their top priorities for the future.
“It’s something that we talk about a lot,” said Associate Dean for Computer Science and Engineering J. Gregory Morrisett. “We are coordinating with a bunch of departments around the world and are trying a lot of different things in the hopes that we will uncover some of the issues and correct for them.”
Morrisett said he hoped to increase the number of female CS faculty members, which currently stands at four out of 18, in order to provide role models for female students considering CS.
He also praised the efforts of CS50 Lecturer David J. Malan ’99, who has worked to make the introductory coding class more accessible to those without a CS background. Under Malan’s tenure, CS50 has attracted record levels of female enrollment, though this has not yet translated to higher numbers of female concentrators.
CS Professor Radhika Nagpal said that while she has grown “more and more puzzled” over the gender disparity, she believes that Harvard can look to some of its peer institutions to improve female participation in CS.
In particular, she highlighted MIT—where 31 percent of CS concentrators are now female—as a school where a concerted effort to improve gender ratios in CS had been extremely successful.
“It isn’t as if there is one factor [causing the imbalance], but that isn’t a reason to give up,” Nagpal said. “I think at Harvard, we have to find a solution. We have to find one that works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During next year's January Term, undergraduates will be allowed to return to campus eight days before classes begin, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced Friday.
The College will be closed to students from Dec. 22 to Jan. 15, 2011, but the campus will open for their return on Jan. 16—approximately a week before second semester classes commence, according to Hammonds' statement to the undergraduate community.
As was the case last year, students with specific needs—including varsity athletes, international students, thesis writers, and students conducting lab-based research—will be able to apply for permission to stay on campus during the period, according to Hammonds' statement.
But in a change from this year’s winter break—when students without explicit approval were not permitted to stay on campus—all undergraduates will be able to return to Harvard about a week before classes begin on Jan. 24. The administration is hoping to facilitate student group-initiated programming during that week-long period.
The College administration is planning to build an “online portal to encourage broad dissemination and participation in these activities,” according to Hammonds' announcement.
Before the announcement was made, groups such as the Institute of Politics and the Phillips Brooks Association House had articulated a desire to organize their own events over winter break.
The longer winter vacation, often referred to as January Term, was created as part of the University’s calendar reform, which took effect this academic year.

While the Harvard men’s volleyball team hopes to be alive in the EIVA playoffs long enough to still be playing in May, the team’s head coach Brian Baise already knows that he will be coaching in May.
From May 22-30, Baise will serve as an assistant coach to the USA men’s volleyball national team while it defends it title in the 2010 Pan-American Cup.
Last season, the United States team went undefeated, winning four matches in five days against the Dominican Republic and Canada. In the championship, the US rallied from a 2-1 deficit to capture the title over Canada in five sets.
Baise will join some familiar faces on the sideline. Returning to coach the national team for another season is Rick McLaughlin, head coach of UC Santa Barbara, a team that defeated the Crimson, 3-0, earlier this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Who knew that just a few games of soccer could help save hundreds of lives?
Tomorrow the Harvard men’s club soccer team will be hosting the “Kick Out Malaria” Tournament for the second year in a row. The competition will feature matches between the men’s club teams from Harvard, Boston College, Brown, and Northeastern in the hopes of raising money to prevent malaria in Sierra Leone.
The tournament started last year when the Crimson squad partnered with an international NGO called Global Minimum (Gmin), a volunteer-based organization co-founded by the Harvard club soccer team’s former co-president, David Sengeh. The NGO undertakes projects to help distribute insecticide-treated mosquito nets to households in Sierra Leone.
The Crimson, which has taken first place in the New England Collegiate Club Soccer League for two consecutive years, has had players travel to Sierra Leone to work with Gmin on some of its projects. But the squad wanted to find a way to help the cause a little closer to home.
Since the NGO also hosts a soccer tournament in Sierra Leone as part of its goal to educate citizens about the dangers of malaria and ways to prevent it, it made sense for Harvard to host a similar event here.
At the tournament, the teams will have a chance to play quality opponents and to become more educated about the fight against malaria. Crimson players will talk to the athletes from participating colleges prior to their matches about the disease and their efforts to prevent it.
The Swiss Consulate of Boston is sponsoring the event, and all profits will go towards helping Global Minimum pay the costs of organizing its educational tournament in Sierra Leone.
“We were obviously having a lot of fun from playing, but we wanted it to be more than that,” Sengeh said. “We wanted to have fun, but also [to] create value for others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bouncing back after a big loss is always tough, but the No. 15 Harvard men’s lacrosse team faces an especially tough task as it looks to rebound from its worst defeat in three years.
After a 14-5 thrashing last Friday night at the hands of No. 7 Duke, the Crimson (5-3, 1-1 Ivy) travels to Ithaca tomorrow to take on the defending national runner-up, No. 10 Cornell (7-2, 2-1 Ivy) at 1 pm.
“It’s definitely a huge game for us,” sophomore attack Jeff Cohen said. “They’re one of the teams to beat in our league, so we’d love to get them this year.”
To win, Harvard freshman goalie Harry Krieger will have to stop a high-powered Big Red offense that has scored over 18 goals twice this season. Despite giving up 14 scores, Krieger made a career-high 17 saves against Duke, earning him Ivy Rookie of the Week honors.
“Cornell plays a different system than Duke,” senior defenseman Ben Smith said. “They’re a little bit more free-flowing. It’s not as much about set plays—they kind of just feed off each other. It’s a little hectic and disorganized, so we’re going to have to communicate well, play very tough on ball, and make it difficult for their players to do what they want.”
The Cornell attack is led by senior Ryan Hurley, who has 26 goals on the year, and sophomore Rob Pannell, who has 15 goals and 26 assists.
Hurley is second in the conference with 2.89 goals per game, and Pannell is first with three assists and 4.67 points per contest.
The defense trying to stop that duo may be without its leader, co-captain Billy Geist, who is questionable after getting injured against the Blue Devils.
“We’ve got to play as a unit,” Smith said. “I think we’re going to try to simplify things a bit. We’re going to play to our strengths.”
Coming off a season-low in goals against Duke, the Crimson offense will need to recover if it is to keep up with a Big Red attack that averages a league-high 23.56 shots on goal per game.
“I think offensively we’re okay,” Cohen said. “What we really need to worry about more is getting the ball into the opposite end of the field, because that includes clearing the ball better, picking up more ground balls, [and] winning faceoffs. I think if we do those things we’ll be able to put up the big goals on offense that we’ve been putting up all year.”
Cohen (20 goals) and Dean Gibbons (19 goals) have led the attack throughout the season. Sophomore Terry White (six goals in his past three games) has helped pick up the slack, and classmate Kevin Vaughan has contributed five goals in his past four games.
Harvard’s 11.38 goals per game average is good for 13th in the country.
Trying to stop them for Cornell will be some combination of freshman AJ Fiore and junior Mat Martinez, who have split time between the pipes this season. Both have done well, with the Big Red leading the Ancient Eight in save percentage. Martinez holds the third-highest individual save percentage in the conference at .667.
One thing Harvard will especially focus on is getting ahead early.
The Crimson have been outshot 30-21 in the first period of games this season and have fallen behind by large margins in their past three games.
The Crimson trailed 6-1 against Brown, 9-3 against Dartmouth, and 9-0 against Duke, only coming out victorious against the Big Green.
Getting off to a good start will be no easy task against Cornell, which has outscored opponents 25-15 in the first period this season.
“I think we need to come out with more confidence,” Smith said. “We’ve shown in the second half that we’ve done really well, so we’ve got to come out flying.”
Neither team hurts itself with penalties; Cornell and Harvard rank 1-2 respectively in the conference in fewest penalties committed.
But while the Big Red is first in the conference with a .762 penalty-killing percentage, Harvard ranks dead last in the Ivy in that category, with a .478 percentage.
For all its impressive statistics, Cornell has only defeated one ranked team—current No. 18 Yale—so far this year. The team is coming off a bad game of its own, a shocking 8-6 upset loss to Dartmouth. The Crimson is 1-3 against ranked opponents in 2010.
Last season, the two teams played an extremely close game in at Schoellkopf Field, with the Big Red coming away victorious, 13-12.
Despite holding a lead for 44 minutes and getting up by as many as four goals, Harvard was outscored 4-1 in the contest’s final 20 minutes.
Hurley had both the game-tying and go-ahead goals in that game, one that has stuck in the Crimson players’ minds for over a year.
“We definitely had a bad taste in our mouth when we left Cornell last year,” Cohen said. “I think we could’ve had them.”
And despite the challenge the Big Red pose, Harvard believes it will be able to get its retribution.
“I’d say we’ve put the Duke game out of our minds,” Cohen said. “We’ve tried to move on. We had a good week of practice, so we’re all very confident going into next week. We all understand its probably the biggest game of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The oft-repeated repeated saying in sports is to go “Win one for the Gipper.” This weekend, the “Gipper” will be Alex Wawrzyniak, a three-year-old listed as a shortstop and right-handed pitcher on the Harvard baseball team’s roster.
The Crimson’s adoption of Wawrzyniak will be celebrated on Saturday, dubbed “Friends of Jaclyn Day” in support of a charitable organization that serves children with pediatric brain tumors.
“It’d be a kind of nice occasion to go out on Saturday and win for him,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said.
But in order to honor the team’s youngest freshman with victories in the first of the weekend's two doubleheaders, the Crimson (8-15, 2-2 Ivy) will have to hold off a Penn squad that is one of two Ivy teams with a 3-1 conference record.
The next day, it will have to face the other—Columbia.
“Really this is a crucial weekend for us,” junior captain Tyler Albright said. “It’s our last series against the teams from the opposite division, our chance to get ahead against teams in our division. It should be an exciting weekend.”
Against the Quakers (12-11), Harvard’s main concern will be keeping in check formidable hitters like seniors Tom Grandieri and William Gordon, who have combined for 61 hits on the year.
“With our starting pitchers and our relievers, we should be able to shut them down,” Albright said. “I have a lot of trust and faith in our starting pitchers, and we’ll have our best relievers.”
Getting the start against Penn will be sophomore Conner Hulse. The right-hander kicked off his season with seven strikeouts in a win over Notre Dame and recently registered a complete game without an earned run in a 1-0 loss to Sacred Heart.
“Conner’s had some nice starts for us,” Walsh said. “His experience from last year—being a freshman in the Iy League—will pay off this year, I think. He’s working on his breaking ball this year—hoping to see a little bit more of that this weekend. Last weekend he was fastball, change. If we get those three pitches going for him, I think he’s got a chance for a real good outing.”
Up next against the Quakers will be junior Eric Eadington, coming off a strong weekend against Princeton in which he held the Tigers to two earned runs.
“We are usually starting to watch his pitch count in the fifth or sixth inning; he’s usually approaching 100+ pitches,” Walsh said. “He got through eight innings last week right around that 100 mark. That just means that he’s throwing a lot more strikes, and he’s using his off speeds and inviting contact from the hitters, not going after the strikeouts. So I’m hoping to get a little bit more of that from him.”
The next day, the Crimson will take on a Columbia squad that shut out Brown in its first game last Sunday.
“Columbia is more balanced,” Walsh said. “They’ve got some guys that can run, they’ve got a bullpen, and I really like Columbia’s catcher, he’s tough to get a running game on.”
With senior Dean Forthun keeping Harvard’s baserunning in checking, the Crimson will need to get its bats going, something Walsh said that team has been working for all season.
“I’ve got confidence in the hitters,” Walsh said. “We just haven’t been getting that clutch two-out hit or having that big inning, scoring three or four runs, and you know that could happen this weekend, and I’m sure hoping it does.”
Harvard saw signs of the long-awaited offensive outburst last weekend against Cornell, especially from freshman Kyle Larrow, who exploded for five RBI.
But while the Crimson works to get its offense going against the Quakers and Lions, it will be able to fall back on strong pitching. Walsh plans to start a resurgent sophomore Brent Suter in either the third or fourth game.
“Last Sunday, Suter really got through his lower back problems,” Walsh said. “[He] really got the giddy-up back on his fastball and mixing that with a good change and curve, I’m more excited about using him on Sunday.”
Meanwhile, Walsh hopes to plug in junior right-hander Max Perlman as well as freshmen Joey Novak and Andrew Ferreira. Perlman, recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitched a scoreless first inning against the Big Red, and Walsh hopes he sees more action this weekend.
“He’s a guy that we’d like to have at the top of our rotation,” Walsh said.
And in the clutch, Walsh plans on turning to sophomore Will Keuper.
“This year, when the game’s on the line, he’s the one I want closing the game for us,” Walsh said. “He’s not your usual closer being a left-hander and more of a curveballer, but you just don’t seem to get a good piece off him, and he’s been pitching real well for us.”
And if Keuper and Harvard deliver, the team may be able to celebrate its youngest teammate with victory.
“Having Alex on the team brings a lot of joy,” Albright said. “We are looking forward to having a day for him. It’ll be a great day.”

It may now seem like the distant past to the Harvard men’s volleyball team, but little more than just a month ago, the Crimson stood at 0-9, still searching for its first victory six weeks into the season.
But things changed rather quickly.
Since then, Harvard (5-12, 3-1 EIVA Hay) has been on a tear, going 5-3 overall and 3-0 in conference play—good for second place in its division.
“I think this type of performance is something we’ve expected and been looking forward to all season,” said co-captain Gil Weintraub, whose team is currently riding a three-game winning streak. “We’re peaking at the right time.”
This weekend, the Crimson will have the opportunity to show just how far it has come.
Heading on the road to take on first-place Rutgers-Newark (10-11, 6-0 EIVA Hay) and NYU (4-17, 0-6 EIVA Hay), Harvard can go a long way toward challenging for the spot atop the division standings and securing one of two playoff berths.
“To have a chance to win league, we have to beat Rutgers-Newark,” said sophomore Matt Jones, whose team has only four conference games remaining. “Every game from here on out is huge. We have to go at least 3 for 4 [to make the playoffs].”
While the Crimson has just recently been experimenting with success, winning is something Rutgers-Newark has been doing all season.
In addition to their undefeated conference record, the Raiders defeated No. 9 Penn St. in four sets nearly two weeks ago.
“They’ve had a great streak recently,” Weintraub said. “For us to beat them, we have to put all the pieces to the puzzle together.”
Recent history is also against Harvard, as the Crimson was swept by Rutgers-Newark earlier this season.
In that contest, Harvard was broken down by a balanced Raiders attack, which saw three different players finish with double-digit kills.
Rutgers-Newark’s powerful attack is led by sophomore Marcin Midura, a strong outside hitter who averages 3.74 kills per set.
The Crimson plans to slow down its opponent’s attack by playing solid defense up the middle, while taking care to distribute the wealth on the offensive end.
“I think we need to be very balanced offensively because they’re a good blocking team,” Jones said. “The outside has been getting a lot of sets. We really need to be able to run a balanced offense, setting all three positions.”
Much of this burden will fall on the shoulders of freshman setter Rob Lothman, who has been having success as of late, averaging 50.3 assists per match over the past three contests.
But while the Crimson has been strategically preparing for its Friday contest, the team knows its second opponent, NYU, cannot be overlooked. Despite their winless conference record, the Violets are a dangerous team, having taken sets off of Princeton and Sacred Heart in recent contests.
“NYU always brings their best play for us,” Weintraub said. “I would argue that the NYU game is equally important if not more important [than the Rutgers-Newark game]. If we get to the playoffs we can do everything we want and more. Beating NYU is the first step to that.”
Harvard defeated the Violets earlier this season, taking the contest in four sets thanks to clutch play down the stretch from co-captain Erik Kuld. The win kick-started the team’s current winning streak.
The Crimson hopes it will have the services this weekend of its other co-captain, Weintraub, who paces Harvard with 2.17 kills and 6.88 assists per set. Weintraub sat out his team’s past two contests with a pulled groin.
According to the veteran, it is unclear which games, if any, he will be medically cleared for this weekend.
“[Having Weintraub play is] essential,” Jones said. “Obviously we can win either way but having Gil will help a lot. That’s an understatement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: 5:20 p.m.
Despite coming off a successful season, in which he won three national titles with the men’s and women’s teams, Harvard squash coach Satinder Bajwa will not see his contract renewed for next year, according to multiple sources.
The rationale behind this decision was still unclear as of this afternoon, with explanations ranging from claims that he has lacked the ability to develop community to allegations that wealthy alumni have opposed his tenure due to his race, according to Albert F. Gordon '59, who is a former Harvard track captain and a significant donor to the Murr Center, the squash team's home.
The men's squash team, which won eight straight national titles in the 1990s, has seen its performance decline recently, finishing fifth nationally in the last two seasons—its worst showing in at least 20 years.
Gordon said he raised the issue of prejudice to Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds and the Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann, who responded in an e-mail to Gordon that no instances of discrimination were found.
An individual familiar with Harvard squash who asked for anonymity said that "internal politics" played a larger role in the lack of renewal and expressed uncertainty regarding the alleged racial motive.
"I think that it was mainly internal politics that caused this. Whether or not race is something that affected those internal politics is hard to say," the individual said. "I'd say it's people butting heads based on cultural or other sort of clashes."
Bajwa said he was limited in what he could discuss in advance of an official announcement at the teams' end-of-season banquet tonight.
“I have to say that at the moment I am not at all in any position ready to comment on anything yet," he said. "I would rather just go to the banquet and enjoy it with both teams, because that's what's most important right now.”
“I want my teams to enjoy what they have achieved and for them to have a great banquet, and then I will focus my attention to what is happening,” Bajwa added.
Bajwa’s work over the past couple of years came to fruition in the 2009-10 season, when the women’s team won the Howe Cup as national champions as well as the Barhite Award, given to the team with the best dual record. Bajwa also coached freshman Laura Gemmell and co-captain Colin West to their respective individual national titles.
In his 11-year tenure at Harvard, Bajwa has coached four individual champions, has won two team titles, and has amassed a combined 175-61 record between the men’s and women’s squads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For diehard baseball fans, the stretch of time between the World Series and spring training is a veritable sports wasteland. Sure, there’s some football, a little basketball, maybe some hockey here and there, but none of it compares to America’s Pastime.
Thankfully it’s April, and baseball is back. With spring trainining over, the Major Leagues have kicked off the regular season and all is right with the world. The Harvard baseball team has also been back in action, and with the first weekend of Ivy play under its belt, the Crimson finds itself in an unfamiliar place (at least in the last few years): first.
At 2-2 against Ancient Eight opponents, Harvard enters this weekend’s doubleheaders against Penn and Columbia tied  at the top of the Rolfe Division standings with Brown and Dartmouth. With a strong weekend, the Crimson could break out in a big way and put itself on the path to the Ivy League Championship Series for the first time since 2006. It won’t be easy though, with Harvard facing tough competition around the ivies.
GEHRIG DIVISION
PENN (12-11, 3-1 IVY)
The Quakers are stacked as far as Ivy League teams go, with a deep lineup and enough serviceable pitchers to fill out a solid weekend rotation. Dan Williams leads the league with a .442 batting average and slugger Tom Grandieri was just named Ivy Player of the Week for his recent five-game tear.
Penn isn’t  as imposing on the mound, but with high strikeout guys at the top of the rotation who eat up innings, the Quaker hurlers do enough to let the team’s batters take care of business.
COLUMBIA (11-12, 3-1 IVY)
Along with Penn, Columbia will make life difficult for Harvard this weekend. Like the Quakers, the Lions let their bats do the talking and have pitchers good enough not to screw things up. Their humongous first baseman—6’6”, 225-pound Alexander Auricchio—leads the Ivy League with eight home runs and slugs at a .787 clip. The rest of the lineup isn’t exactly filled with slouches, so the Crimson pitchers better be on top of their game this weekend.
CORNELL (6-10, 2-2 IVY)
My football Around the Ivies column was never the same after Cornell’s Nathan Ford graduated, and this venture into scouting the Ivy baseball scene also lacks Ford’s presence. The trigger-happy quarterback was also a mashing second baseman, and was famously immortalized in The Office by Dwight.
Ford has been missed in the middle of the Big Red’s lineup—no Cornell batter has more than two home runs or 12 RBI in 16 games of play. The most intriguing player on the squad is starter Corey Pappel, who has 27 strikeouts in 23 innings and boasts a 2.35 ERA.
PRINCETON (7-16, 2-2 IVY)
The Tigers are pretty underwhelming, and are lucky to still have a fighting chance in the Gehrig. The only real threat in their lineup is Jon Broscious, a disciple of the cult of the Three True Outcomes with his six home runs, 23 strikeouts, and nine walks in 23 games.
ROLFE DIVISION
DARTMOUTH (9-10, 2-2 IVY)
The Big Green is very alive in the  race to the top of the Rolfe, which at this juncture seems to be the weaker Ivy division. But Dartmouth’s certainly not the dominant force that it once was. With marquee slugger Nick Santomauro in the New York Mets’ farm system and the rest of last year’s strong senior class gone, Dartmouth lacks punch in its lineup.
The team is kept afloat by its starting pitchers, especially the trio of Kyle Hunter, Kyle Hendricks, and Robert Young—a gritty bunch that gives up a lot of hits but manages to find outs at the right times to keep the Big Green in games.
HARVARD (8-15, 2-2 IVY)
At 2-2, the Crimson isn’t exactly flying high, but Harvard held its own against tough non-conference opponents during March and has the pitching to make a serious run at a Rolfe title.
In sophomore hurler Conner Hulse, the Crimson has a bonafide ace. In five appearances (four starts) Hulse has held opponents to a measly .218 batting average, striking out 26 in 30 innings. Junior Eric Eadington and sophomore Brent Suter have bloated ERAs but have been coming around and provide a nice supporting cast for Hulse. The real wild card for Harvard is junior Max Perlman, who is on the mend from Tommy John surgery but made his first appearance against Cornell last weekend and pitched a scoreless inning. If Perlman can return to the starting rotation, the Crimson could very well have the best pitching staff in the Ivies.
BROWN (5-15, 2-2)
The Bears aren’t capable of mauling much of anyone these days. Brown managed to escape from its first weekend of Ivy play at .500, but the team s going to have a hard time sustaining that record with its current cast of characters.
The Bears do have a true cleanup man in first baseman Pete Greskoff, who has seven home runs and 27 RBI. Ryan Zrenda can swing the lumber as well, but the Brown lineup falls off from there, and the team’s pitching staff is only something to write home about if you’re writing a horror story.
YALE (12-11, 0-4 IVY)
One of only two Ivy League teams with an overall record above .500, the Bulldogs ran into tough opponents and hard luck last weekend as they were swept by Columbia and Penn. Besides a 12-4 blowout at the hands of the Quakers, Yale lost each game by three runs or less.
Yale has a host of big-time hitters and a very deep pitching staff, so don’t expect the Bulldogs to roll over easily this season.

When most people think “marathon,”  they think “impossible”—and not without reason. The first-ever  marathon runner—Pheidippides in 490 BC—collapsed on the spot and died after  his 26.2-mile run.
But Scott C. Smider '01, general manager  of the Queen’s Head Pub and a freshman proctor in Wigg G, would disagree.  On April 19, when Smider reaches the starting line for  the world-famous Boston Marathon, he will already have completed three  marathons. At that point, for Smider, it will be 78.6 consecutive miles down, 26.2  to go.
Though this may seem crazy to some,  when asked about his race distance for next weekend, Smider said,  “104.8 [miles]. It should be a lot of fun.”
Smider, a member of the Dana Farber  Marathon Challenge team, plans to start his trek at 3 p.m. on Sunday, April   18 and run the Boston Marathon course four times through,  finishing the first three just in time to start the official race on  Monday morning.
Smider’s training for next week’s  race is generally composed of low-mileage weekday runs  in conjunction with higher mileage runs on successive days on the  weekends.  According to Smider, training for a 100+ mile race is very similar to  preparing to run a marathon. While long runs are key, it’s important  not to do too much on a single day. His long runs peaked in terms of  mileage a couple weeks ago with 30-mile, 20-mile, and 20-mile runs on  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday respectively. That’s right—Smider runs  marathons in training.
So why would anyone want to do this?
“A lot of people asked why and I  didn’t really have a good reason,” he said. “I figured if  I’m able to do this, I might as well do something good out of it,  so that’s why I’m trying to do a little bit of fundraising for a  good cause.”
Smider is running to benefit cancer  research at Dana Farber, in honor of his sister-in-law, Elizabeth, who  passed away on Dec. 24, 2008 after a long battle with breast cancer.
Donations to the cause can be made  here.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 10, 2010
An earlier version of the April 9 post "Alum to Run Over 100 Miles For a Good Cause" incorrectly stated that Pheidippides made his famous marathon in 546 BC. In fact, according to tradition, he ran it in 490 BC.
