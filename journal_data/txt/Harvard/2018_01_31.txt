After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his inaugural address as the new Mayor of Cambridge in January 2018, Marc McGovern laid out a case for unity to a city that has struggled for years to achieve it: “[D]espite being surrounded by world-class universities, being the innovation capital of the world and our AAA bond rating, we have far too many in our community who are not accessing the prosperity that surrounds us.” Mayor McGovern is a life-long Cantabrigian, and his vision for the city’s future takes its name from his former youth soccer team: Cambridge United.
We’re a city of dichotomies. Cambridge's population include 450 millionaires and 517 people experiencing homelessness. The Massachusetts Department of Education recently downgraded Cambridge Rindge and Latin School’s Accountability and Assistance Level ranking to Level 2 for “[n]ot meeting gap narrowing goals.” This means that while the overall number of students scoring above proficient met state standards, gaps in the results on the basis of race and socioeconomic status were too great. Crimson columns highlight the juxtaposition of homelessness and extreme wealth in Harvard Square. We have three Whole Foods locations, each in a census tract adjoining one of our three food deserts.
The division between Harvard affiliates and Cambridge residents is one of the most pronounced and entrenched. Former Mayor Alfred E. Vellucci once famously said,  “When Harvard’s for something, I’m against it,” and proposed turning Harvard Yard into a parking lot. In my 19 years living in Cambridge—two of them as a Harvard student—I’ve found that this animosity can be personal as well.
Frustration and anger at Harvard is common among many of my lifelong friends. People who are generally reasonable describe Harvard students from Cambridge as sellouts and shills, or say things like “Harvard is the worst institution in America.” The gap between these two mindsets is so stark that I frequently find myself talking to my local friends about being “away at school” or making plans to meet up “when I get home,” even if I’m meeting someone in Central Square, closer to Harvard than my home. My new home in the Quad feels separated from the Graham and Parks School, where I spent nine years, by a gap much wider than Walker Street.
I frequently tell people on both sides of this divide that they should be more open-minded. Cambridge residents should meet a few Harvard students before writing them all off as irredeemable. Harvard students should say less problematic things about Cambridge and its residents. I still believe this, but I’ve also learned a lot about the issues that affect all of us. Harvard expansion and Cambridge zoning may have created the economics that drive gentrification, but its effects hurt lifelong Cambridge residents and Harvard graduate students alike. Many Cambridge businesses rely on both students and resident customers to stay afloat, so these customers rely on each other to protect their communities and lifestyles. Both the Phillips Brooks House Association and the many beneficiaries of its Cambridge programs want the organizations to provide their services as effectively and respectfully as possible. Even on issues that seem clearly oppositional, like PILOT, the amount that Harvard sends to the city each year as payment in lieu of taxes, building bridges of understanding enables Harvard to provide effective non-financial benefits to the city where they are needed.
Many Cantabrigians refer to our city in passing as “the 'Bridge.” While it’s not much shorter than just saying “Cambridge,” the moniker conveys a lot about our pride. We’re the Cambridge, with a unique history, proud culture, incredible people, and transcendent high school basketball team. But our city wasn’t built in a vacuum. Harvard has shaped Cambridge just as Cambridge has shaped Harvard, and both communities need to understand this in order to move forward.
I hope that “the 'Bridge” can take on another meaning. There are many issues that connect Harvard and Cambridge in their origins and their impacts, and each has concrete action items that both communities can take. To start the process, Harvard students should read at least two articles from the Metro section of the CRLS Register Forum and one from the humor section. In turn, Cambridge residents should read at least one article from the Issues section of Fifteen Minutes and one from Flyby. Harvard's responses to five questions from the City in their annual Town Gown Report also offer some insight into both perspectives.
Some town-gown tensions might be entrenched, but they aren’t all inherent. The gates of Harvard Yard are almost always open, and people from every neighborhood and every house cross its paths heading to work, class, school, libraries, restaurants, and more. People on the way to CRLS or the Main Library and those leaving Sever or Widener pass by wordlessly; while the communities that they navigate are distinct, we can do more to acknowledge where they overlap.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ed Gillespie ran for governor of Virginia.
Ed Gillespie partook in racist fear-mongering.
Ed Gillespie lost.
Ed Gillespie was given a fellowship at the Institute of Politics.
During the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election, Gillespie’s campaign ran a television advertisement that blasted his opponent, Ralph Northam, for being the deciding vote “in favor of sanctuary cities.” Next to a picture of Northam were three tattooed Latino men. The men, the ad claims, are members of MS-13, a Salvadoran gang that has been responsible for a number of high-profile homicides in Virginia. Northam is to blame for the rise of the terrifying gang members shown in the ad.
A minor problem: the men pictured were not members of MS-13 at all. They were not even in the United States. The picture was taken in a prison in El Salvador, and the gang members belonged to Barrio 18, a completely separate gang. The advertisement prioritized shock-value over accuracy. Research shows that sanctuary status does not increase crime rates, making Gillespie’s campaign strategy nothing more than a disingenuous appeal to the fear of Virginia voters. Instead of appealing to voters with solutions, he catered to their innermost anxieties. Immigrants in Virginia were caught in the crossfire. Instead of being acknowledged as the soul of their communities, immigrants were smeared as gang members and criminals.
On the surface, a failed gubernatorial candidate who peddles in xenophobia does not seem like a  productive person to teach Harvard students, in his IOP study group, about “[t]he processes through which ideas become public policy.” Undoubtedly, his tactics do not deserve the sense of honor that comes with a Harvard fellowship. But, for today’s GOP, nativist rhetoric that scapegoats immigrants is just another part of the party’s playbook. Ed Gillespie was just following the lead of his party’s leadership.
In July, President Donald Trump gave a speech to Long Island law enforcement, in a region that has been dealing with a very real problem with MS-13. Instead of focusing on the specific issue of gang violence, he used a sensationalized version of the problem to justify his broad immigration policy. Trump claimed that MS-13 had “transformed peaceful parks and beautiful, quiet neighborhoods into bloodstained killing fields.” He argued that his wall, restrictions on immigration, and a harsher immigration policy than Obama (who deported more than 5.2 million people) would solve the MS-13 issue.
In fact, his immigration policy has done a lot to terrorize immigrant communities and little to eradicate MS-13. In 2017, ICE arrested 68,346 individuals for non-DUI traffic violations and 62,517 others for immigration related reasons. 1,886 individuals were arrested for homicide, only a percentage of whom could be linked to MS-13. More than ten percent of arrests were of individuals with no known criminal charges or convictions.
ICE has also arrested multiple American citizens and is attempting to destroy records documenting the abuse immigrants experienced while in custody, including instances of sexual assault and death. In short, enforcement policies target a much broader net than just gang members. They rip apart families, foster mistrust between law enforcement and the people they serve, and do not adequately fix the problems they claim to.
Ideas do become policy, and politicians’ baseless ideas about MS-13’s relationship to other undocumented immigrants has led to inhumane immigration policy. Ed Gillespie and the rest of the Republican Party must defend the way their campaigns have mixed fear and racism to garner votes, especially since their rhetoric’s damage outweighs its benefits.
Gillespie—with the help of Trump, Senator Tom Cotton '98, Stephen Miller, and company—has tried making resentment against immigrants an acceptable way of winning elections. A discussion of whether or not he is culpable of perpetrating white supremacy, fear-mongering, or xenophobia is beside the point now. It is not likely that the Institute of Politics will rescind his fellowship. After all, they tolerated Sean Spicer’s blatant dishonesty and Corey Lewandowski's constant misogyny.
It’s even less likely that a rogue question during a Q&A session will force Gillespie to atone for his sins. That makes it too easy for him to offer a politically calculated answer that sounds good but says nothing substantial. Instead, Gillespie’s liaisons should push him on the more unsavory moments of his campaign and organize a session dedicated to criticisms of his campaign. They should dedicate time to exploring the way politicians think and talk about undocumented immigrants, especially during election season.
Racist fear-mongering is not a fringe issue—it has become embedded in the fabric of the GOP’s political strategy. It’s critical that, short of rescinding their offer, the Institute of Politics push Gillespie to seriously address the way fictions about immigrants are being used to further political goals. The issue must be treated as the main affair, rather than a peripheral side-show.
Immigrants are the ones that pay for political recklessness. Asking that politicians, who constantly play with their fates, explain themselves is the bare minimum.

On Sunday, The Crimson reported that World Bank President Jim Yong Kim has been in contact with Harvard’s presidential search committee and is considering whether to accept the University’s top job, were he offered it. Kim’s prestigious track record demonstrates that he has valuable experience in many areas. In particular, his current work at the World Bank has prepared him well for the financial and political responsibilities of the University president, specifically as the role pertains to fundraising and overseeing Harvard's financials.
In the past few months, The Crimson has additionally connected Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, another likely candidate with demonstrable financial acumen, to Harvard's presidential search. Kim and Nohria's resumes suggest the search committee may be taking closer looks at candidates with significant financial experience. And while this background  is important, especially given the current state of the University's finances, we hope that the searchers prioritize other factors and skills.
We have previously opined that we believe Harvard’s next leader should be someone who has internal experience and a resulting understanding of the current problems the University confronts. In particular, given the pressing issues facing the College specifically, we would like to see a University president who has had past interaction with undergraduates, whether as a professor or administrator. Although Kim served as Dartmouth's president from 2009 to 2012, he faced strong criticism from undergraduates in Hanover concerning his inability to adequately address some of the most pressing problems that they faced, including sexual assault, hazing, and student mental health. We hope that Harvard’s next president will prioritize these issues.
Additionally, we believe that the next University president should have experience heading other international initiatives, as Harvard looks to take on an increasingly global role. Furthermore, the next President will likely need an established background in STEM to properly manage Harvard’s impending expansion into Allston and to ensure that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences flourishes.
Finally, we believe diversity must be an essential consideration for the search committee. Kim’s likely candidacy leaves open the possibility that unlike Harvard's previous 28 presidents, the University's next president could be its first ever non-white one. We believe it is important to consider diversity in candidates as a matter of representation, but we also hope the search committee will select a candidate who will prioritize issues of diversity on campus while in office.
Indeed, Harvard’s ability to commit to diversity is currently under attack from Washington. In coming years, it may become more difficult to offer an education to students regardless of their citizenship status, and financial aid resources may become increasingly strained due to the recently-passed endowment tax. As a result, we further believe candidates’ lobbying abilities and capability to communicate effectively with lawmakers should be considered vital for their fitness for the job.
We commend the search committee on their work thus far and appreciate their efforts to bring a candidate to Harvard who has the necessary experience to help improve the University’s financial situation. We hope, however, that the presidential search committee will also consider other factors—diversity, political acumen, international experience, and knowledge of STEM in particular.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Words leisurely unfold out of my mouth. They glide off my tongue with the smooth ebb and flow of the rolling blue Appalachian mountains I grew up on; the drawling vowels stretch long like valleys and consonants tumble down sloping ridgelines into reluctant contractions. My speech was sheltered: I heard the faraway celebrities and newscasters and their strange, crisp voices, but I grew up surrounded by the slow, beautiful dialect that, from my first word on, became my own.
I knew it was unique, a tongue confined to my small part of the world. I knew the stereotypes, the assumed ignorance and backwardness associated with verbal loll and drawl, and I knew the North didn’t hear many voices like mine. What I did not know, or rather, expect, was how my distinct accent would become my identifier, how it would immediately—and permanently—make me so boldly stand out when up until that point in my life it had made me belong. I did not expect to root myself in dissimilarity.I laud Harvard for its diversity, for its medley of race and religion and identity that I was never exposed to in my small, rural hometown. I love the atmosphere of inclusivity and the sense of belonging our college is so dedicated to achieving. I can’t help but notice, though, the glaring absence of Southern accents. I’ve heard it only once, and just in passing, during my first semester at Harvard. Have I just avoided it by bad luck and timing, or is it hiding?
I admit that I tried to conceal mine. My first week in the North—which consisted of many laughable miscommunications and several confused, wide-eyed waitresses asking “Can you repeat that?”—proved that the accent made me something of a novelty. Everyone I spoke to either asked or guessed where I was from.  (Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, and, bafflingly, Australia, were the most popular presumptions.) Then, when I revealed my home was in southwest Virginia—the heart of central Appalachia—I became even more of a curiosity. (I can’t imagine what the rest of the nation assumes about native Appalachians, but the shocked expressions made me think the worst.)
I disliked how the conversation almost immediately turned to Southern stereotypes: rural conservatism, Trump, poverty, the declining coal industry. Even though these were relevant topics, I was disappointed that this was all people knew about Appalachia and the only way they knew how to relate to me. I was annoyed when I was congratulated for “making it out,” as if Appalachia were a place to escape. I was most bothered by people who asked me to repeat words only to point out and break down my unique pronunciations: They were only fascinated, not making fun, but I felt ridiculed all the same. I quickly realized why Harvard is an amalgam of hundreds of voices, minus my own; when you hear an accent as backwoodsy as mine in the city, it tends to turn heads, prompt questions, and elicit old, tired conversations us Southerners are sick of having.So, in a desperate attempt to fit in, I tried to suppress the twang. I already felt out of place as it was, having transferred from a teensy-weensy, rural  Southern community college to an outrageously wealthy and prestigious university in a major Northeastern city, so I figured that vocal modification would be the first step to successful assimilation. The result was cringey—a strange mixture of over-enunciation and clipped, strained vowels in attempted replication of what I thought sounded like a neutral, made-for-TV accent. This laughable oddity unsurprisingly earned me even more quizzical glances and questions than before. I quickly abandoned that ship. At first, I was dismayed at my inability to forge a more inconspicuous accent. I’d hoped my identifying characteristic would be anything but the way I pronounced my words. Yet, interestingly enough, the more I was asked about my accent and, subsequently, culture, the more I began to appreciate my difference. There was no changing the drawl; that was painfully obvious. There was only embracing the accent—sink or swim, right?—in an attempt to maybe, hopefully, challenge and change stereotypes and perceptions.
I can’t pinpoint when the exact shift in perspective occurred, but by the end of my first semester I was almost excited to be questioned. As I became increasingly homesick, tired of this strange, loud, city life, I relished the opportunity to talk about my calm, quiet Appalachia. I simultaneously became more and less aware of my difference: The more diversity I saw and experienced, the more I realized the non-necessity of belonging and the beauty in standing out. That the uniqueness of the Southern accent is something to celebrate, not conceal.
Ask me about my accent. Let me tell stories about the South; let me flaunt this beautiful drawl.
You ain’t gonna hear many of ’em up here, ya know.

At first glance, you find it impossible to tell where brine ends and Van Holten’s Hearty Dill Flavor Dill Pickle begins. In fact, if it weren’t for the “CONTENTS: 1 PICKLE” emblazoned on the bottom right corner of the bag, you would miss the yellowish lugubrious form entirely.
The single-serve vacuum-sealed pickle you’re observing is one of many immersed in an ice bath in the back corner of Tommy’s Value. The pickles resemble alien fetuses preserved for government inspection, bobbing in salty amniotic fluid.
Although visually unappealing, the pickle has a satisfying handfeel under a hearty squeeze. Cold brine rushes around your fingers until they firmly grasp a perfectly smooth piece of Food. You grab two bags from the bath and take them to the cashier. In addition to Hearty Dill Flavor, you buy Zesty Garlic Flavor because you are feeling Fun and Flirtatious.
There’s an air of mystery to the Van Holten’s pickle—thousands of milligrams of sodium lie beneath a thin layer of plastic, concealing a cucumber that has been radicalized. After all, no bacteria could possibly survive under such toxic conditions. It could be buried and eaten in 100,000 years.
But your harsh and unforgiving editor demands 400-500 words of pickle copy on her desk by Friday, and you cannot afford to wait that long. You break the seal on the Hearty Dill bag with extreme caution: The Van Holten’s company includes a generous helping of translucent brine with every pickle, clearly inspired by the syrup that comes in single-serve fruit cups.
As air seeps in, the bag expands like a sprawling middle-aged man on the T. Brine rushes to fill new volume, exposing the rounded end of a waxy pickle. A small scar marks where a young cucumber once suckled on the vine. Oh, how things change! Jaundiced, pruned, and covered in warts, the pickle reveals its dark past—horrible things. It, too, was once Zesty.
You push the pickle up from the bottom, like a freeze-pop (note: the Van Holten’s company also sells frozen pickle pops). The pickle looks up at you expectantly. The whole occasion is unfortunately erotic. Swallowing your pride and the Freudian weight of the moment, you take an enormous and crunchy bite.
The flavor is somewhat buttery, with light dill accents and a fruit-forward mouthfeel. Alas, this innocuous taste is undercut by an ocean-like saltiness. You have tasted nothing saltier in your entire life, and you once ate salt directly from the shaker. It’s as if you licked the hot belly of a sweaty football player, but the football player is preserved in brine.
You sit down, confronted by your own weakness. You are small, human, dependent on delicate chemical balances. The salt that just entered your bloodstream has already condemned you to death by hypertension. Before the Van Holten’s Hearty Dill Flavor Dill Pickle, you are nothing.

Harvard’s recent pledge to spend $50 million to construct a transit station in Allston left some locals hopeful for the future; others, though, say they wish the University would do more.
In Oct. 2014, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority proposed connecting Allston to Boston and the surrounding area through a new commuter rail station called West Station, slated to be built on Harvard-owned land near Beacon Park Yard. Harvard committed at the time to pay one third of the building costs.
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation originally planned to complete West Station by 2025, but late last year announced it will instead begin construction nearly two decades later in 2040, in part due to financial concerns.
After state politicians and citizens raised an outcry over the delay, Harvard increased its funding pledge to $50 million, a significant increase. The University also offered to allot up to $8 million to help build an interim, “early action” transit station prior to the completion of West Station.
In the wake of the University’s pledge, announced last week, some Allston and Brighton residents said they were thrilled by the promised influx of Harvard money.
Daniel J. Daly, who lives in Brighton, said Harvard’s new funding commitment amounts to “saving that project that was disappearing.”
“I believe with Harvard’s increased pledge, the station will be complete before 2040,” he said.
Others were less optimistic. Allstonian Max Rome said he believes Harvard has the capacity to pledge even more money to West Station.
In a public letter sent in late January, state politicians called on Harvard to pay nearly the entire cost of West Station. Were the University to do so, it would have to fork over almost $100 million, according to the most recent estimates.
“I think that it’s their [Harvard’s] responsibility to help with projects like this especially given how much they’ve been able to take from this city,” Tony Arias, another Allston resident, said.
In a statement responding to the state politicians' letter, University spokesperson Brigid O'Rourke reaffirmed Harvard's commitment to footing part of the bill. 
“The University...remains committed to working with the Commonwealth, the City, MassDOT and all stakeholders towards a comprehensive vision that will contribute to the entire region," O'Rourke wrote.
Apart from his financial concerns, Rome also said he has reservations about West Station more generally, calling the plans “mediocre.”
Specifically, he said he thinks the proposed commuter rail station lacks “connectivity,” meaning it provides service to an inadequate number of locations.
“I would say that West Station is not the holy grail of doing a transit-oriented development. West Station is like the pathetic minimum that we should absolutely be locking in,” he said.
Rome pointed to what he called a lack of adequate public transportation in Seaport District, a recently developed neighborhood in South Boston, as a “mistake” to avoid in Allston.
He particularly stressed the importance of incorporating transportation into Allston developmental plans more broadly.
“I think the point is that it would be totally crazy to move ahead with this project without building the transit into this project,” Rome said. “If you build the transit now, then people who are getting jobs can build their lives around knowing that they can take the train to the job.”

The public lacks confidence in both government and business leaders, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria and Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an editorial for the non-profit media website "Project Syndicate" Monday.
Using examples of effective leadership from across the public and private sectors, Nohria and Elmendorf argued that leaders must demonstrate certain traits in order to regain the trust of their constituents.
Their editorial on leadership comes as Harvard searches for its 29th president—a role faculty and alumni say could be filled by Nohria himself.
The deans opened their op-ed with two statistics from the Edelman Trust Barometer, which measures public trust in governments, businesses, NGOs, and media organizations around the world. According to their 2017 poll, 63 percent of people globally consider CEOs not credible or only somewhat credible. This percentage rises to 71 percent for government officials.
Elmendorf and Nohria warned of the consequences of public distrust in societal leaders.
“Distrust leads to political polarization, widespread anxiety about the future, and uncertainty in domestic affairs and international relations. And these symptoms then reinforce the loss of trust, creating a vicious circle,” the two wrote.
The deans then offered suggestions for business and government leaders to reverse the downward trend in public confidence and highlighted several core qualities of effective leadership.
The best leaders, the deans argued, must value truth and evidence in decision-making. The authors cited billionaire Warren Buffett and former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill as individuals who showcased this truth and honesty.
Elmendorf and Nohria also wrote about the importance of respect for individuals of all backgrounds, citing the work of Apple CEO Tim Cook as an example of a business leader effectively creating an inclusive organization.
Another key quality, the deans wrote, is the ability of leaders to balance and learn from a variety of different and conflicting viewpoints in a civil manner.
In the fall, Elmendorf led the Kennedy School through several controversies surrounding contentious speakers, with protests at a speech by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and after the school withdrew Chelsea Manning’s fellowship following backlash from within and beyond the University.
Nohria and Elmendorf emphasized one final quality essential to effective leadership: the best leaders seek to improve the lives of their citizens or customers.
“Government officials must build and defend robust civic institutions and political processes that serve the public interest; and businesses must ensure that they are working effectively for all of their stakeholders,” Nohria and Elmendorf wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate student union organizers and University representatives are currently negotiating over the date when the University will generate the list of eligible voters for the upcoming second unionization election.
The timing could influence the composition of the list, as graduate and undergraduate students’ teaching status may change depending on when the list is generated, according to Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran.
In a letter to The Crimson, Curran wrote that the University aims to generate the voter list in mid-March, after most students have finalized their teaching and research appointments for the semester.
“On the November 2016 election: the University learned a lot and has taken steps to modify our processes in preparation for a second election. A clear lesson is that sufficient time is required to create the best possible list,” Curran wrote in the letter, published Sunday.
Andrew B. Donnelly, a Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers organizer, said the union wants the list to be generated in February in order to provide more time for HGSU-UAW to address any potential issues with the list.
The voter list was a point of contention in the original Nov. 2016 unionization election, when HGSU-UAW claimed that the voter list the University provided was insufficient. The subsequent legal battle and administrative deadlock stalled the unionization process for over a year.
In December, the federal National Labor Relations Board upheld a previous decision which found that the Nov. 2016 voter lists were inadequate, effectively mandating a second election.
“In the November 2016 election, Harvard gave its incomplete list to us three weeks before the election, which meant we didn't have time to discover the over 500 omissions,” Donnelly wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
“An earlier list means more time to check its accuracy. If a February list doesn't include all the eligible workers, Harvard can amend the list. Why wait an extra month, shortening the time for errors to be corrected?” he added.
In his letter, Curran wrote that the union’s proposed February deadline for the list would be “just after the add/drop deadline, when enrollments and teaching assignments are still in flux.”
Per NLRB procedure, Harvard and HGSU-UAW may negotiate over the terms of an second election to determine whether graduate students have the right to collectively bargain with the University. The two parties will present the product of their negotiations, an election agreement, to the NLRB’s regional officials.
Though the NLRB will ultimately set the terms of the new election, including its date, the Board will take into consideration any agreement made between the two parties.
The second election will likely take place in the coming months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As administrators postpone the roll-out of the long-awaited new Program in General Education, students continue to express confusion over how they will fulfill their requirements.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced last Monday that the revamped General Education requirements will take full effect in fall 2019, a year later than originally scheduled. Affected students—current freshmen and sophomores—have met his announcement with uncertainty as they struggle to determine what the changes will mean for them.
The overhauled system of General Education requirements will replace one that is “failing on a variety of fronts,” according to a report compiled in 2015. While administrators have yet to iron out all the details of the program, they have determined that students must take three courses in the Science and Engineering, Arts and Humanities, and Social Science divisions in addition to four General Education classes across a variety of fields.
Current freshmen and sophomores will graduate under the new requirements, though they may use current General Education courses to fulfill their requirements.
Many students—freshmen in particular—claimed they do not fully understand how the program works, and they said the delay has only exacerbated their confusion.
“I never fully understood the system in the first place, so moving forward, it’s [the delay] just going to make it even more unsure and confusing,” J. Caleb Stickney ’21 said.
Andrew D. Crawford ’21 said the timing of the announcement resulted in “a lot of stress” as he had to contend with a change in his initial concentration plans.
“I thought it was pretty weird, especially as I was coming into this new semester,” Crawford said. “I thought I knew what major I wanted coming in here, but last semester I found that wasn’t what I wanted to do. So I took a Gen Ed course, and it’s just confusing trying to figure out what transferred.”
In an interview last week, director of the General Education program Stephanie H. Kenen said that designing courses that will fit into the new system is taking longer than initially expected, and a delay will ultimately result in a stronger program.
Ava M. Hampton ’21 said she thought the new policies were “unclear.” She said she planned to continue taking old General Education classes due to a familiarity with the old system.
“I'm probably going to end up fulfilling the old requirements just because I understand what they are more clearly,” Hampton said.
Still, others remained unconcerned and even welcomed the delay.
John Schaefer ’21 said he felt “comfortable” with the transition and praised the flexibility in the requirements.
“To be perfectly honest, I’ve been taking classes under the impression that I’ll fulfill the requirements eventually,” Schaeffer said.
Brandyn H. Ulrich ’21 also said he was not overly concerned about fulfilling his requirements even though he found the transition to be an “inconvenience.”
“I think enough of it is similar to where I have a good enough understanding now, so I’m not too worried about what classes count for what Gen Eds,” Ulrich said.
Hampton said she recognized the importance of postponing the new system, which she called “a good first step.”
“Advisers will be able to give better advice because I feel like a lot of them weren't exactly sure what the new program required either,” Hampton said. “I feel like once there's more time to familiarize everyone with the new requirements, it'll be a much better system.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 31, 2018 at 7:06 p.m.
Rent for University-owned apartments will increase between zero and three percent for leases beginning in the 2018-2019 academic year, Harvard University Housing announced earlier this month.
Next year’s prices, which include utilities, will range from $1,332 to $5,106 per month. Last year, those living in University housing saw a 2.5 percent increase in rent for existing tenants and three percent for new tenants. At the same time, stipends for graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences increased by only 1.5 percent in response to poor returns on Harvard’s endowment.
Graduate students comprise one of several demographics that live in Harvard housing. Only GSAS Ph.D. students receive University stipends; students at the University's other professional schools—like Harvard Law School or Harvard Business School—do not get stipends, but may also live in Harvard housing.
To determine the rents for the approximately 3,000 University-owned apartments, an external contractor analyzes sources such as off-campus rentals provided by HUH and non-Harvard rental websites in order to gauge prices at competing apartment complexes in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville. Changes in rent are determined on a unit-by-unit basis, so not all tenants will see an increase.
The rents, which will take effect this fall, were endorsed by the Faculty Advisory Committee on Harvard University Housing.  The University’s policy on setting rents has been in place since 1983. In order to avoid potential conflicts with financial aid policies, HUH sets rents at market prices rather than at reduced rates for students, according to the announcement of the changes in the Harvard Gazette, a publication run by Harvard Public Affairs and Communications.
Slavic Languages and Literatures Ph.D. student Abigail Weil criticized the change in an email.
“In general I think a situation where your boss is also your landlord should be avoided whenever possible,” she wrote.
In the past, any changes to graduate student stipend rates have been announced later in the spring. The average rent in Greater Boston increased by 2.9 percent in the last year.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences held its second ever sophomore convocation Tuesday evening to welcome new concentrators and introduce them to career and extracurricular opportunities in their fields.
There are 378 SEAS concentrators in the Class of 2020, making up 37 percent of all SEAS concentrators at the College. SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said that over 200 students RSVP’d, most of whom attended the event, held in Science Center D. The number of sophomore concentrators and the total number SEAS concentrators are both record-highs for the school, according to Karoff.
Karoff said the convocation began as an initiative to generate a “sense of community” among SEAS concentrators, who are not usually brought together until graduation.
“One of the ways that SEAS as a school is structured is that we have these five concentrations, but they really overlap a lot,” he said. “We see that in lots of different ways in terms of how the faculty work together in research, you see that in terms of the graduate students and the work that they do, but at the undergraduate level, it’s just as true.”
In his opening remarks at the convocation, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said that though women make up one-third of the sophomore SEAS class, and 21 percent are underrepresented minority students, diversity remains a core area of focus for SEAS.
Comparatively, according to The Crimson’s annual freshman survey, 49.3 percent of  respondents from the class of 2020 identify as female and 26.4 percent of respondents identify as underrepresented minorities.
“We’re doing better, but in my mind, not good enough,”Doyle said. “We need to be more reflective of the total college student body here, and that needs to be more reflective of society. But we’re moving the needle in the right direction.”
Doyle then introduced three current SEAS undergraduates, Neel Mehta ’18, Jacob C. Scherba ’18, and Akshaya Annapragada ’20, who briefly shared some of their experiences with internships and research.
“We have the ability to help millions of Americans and millions of students around the world with the things we’ve learned in lecture halls like these,” Mehta said.
After the student presentations, Doyle moderated an alumni panel of five speakers: Nathan U. Blecharczyk ’05, a co-founder of Airbnb, Danielle A. Feinberg ’96, Director of Photography for Lighting at Pixar, Stephanie M. Kladakis ’96, a vice president at Carmell Therapeutics, Daniel H. Nevius ’11, a co-founder of Analytical Space, and Julia C. Winn ’12, a product manager at Google.
Panelists reflected on their experiences at SEAS and Harvard, covering a variety of topics including things they wish they had done differently, the most valuable parts of their college experience, and the challenges of being a woman in a STEM field.
Kladakis said interacting with a diverse range of people at Harvard, such as roommates who were pursuing creative art projects or discussing novels, proved valuable to her in the business world.
“Things like that give you a broader experience than just being an engineer and as you become a leader in these companies, being able to relate to many folks, not just the engineers, is so important,” she said.
Nevius said that he regretted not taking more risks as an undergraduate.
“I guarantee you will learn more by failing at something no one’s ever done before and trying it than succeeding at something people succeed at everyday,” he said.
After the panel, the convocation broke out into a reception, at which representatives of SEAS-focused student groups met with the new concentrators.

Twelve of the top 100 most-cited law professors of all time teach at Harvard Law School, according to the Social Science Research Network—and professors Lucian A. Bebchuk and Steven Shavell took the first two spots.
An electronic service that aims to make research papers and scholarly articles easily accessible, the SSRN contains over 650,000 documents by more than 360,000 authors. The service calculates the number of citations each author receives in other papers in the SSRN’s e-library. These citations only count for public, full-text papers.
The rankings are updated every year, and Bebchuk retained his spot at number one.
“The rankings reflect the significant impact that the Harvard Law School faculty has on policy research and the legal academy,” Bebchuk wrote in an email.
Law Professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75, who ranks in fourth place with 1,484 citations, said he thinks there is a significant benefit to publishing work on SSRN.
“I think it’s a good thing if you have a paper that’s published and that could benefit from the comments and criticisms of others,” Sunstein said. “You can send it to the Social Science Research Network and you’ll often get some very helpful reactions.”
The list also includes Law professors Louis Kaplow, Reinier H. Kraakman ’71, Mark J. Roe, Jesse M. Fried ’86, Alma Cohen, Allen Ferrell, John Coates IV, Oren Bar-Gill, and J. Mark Ramseyer.
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote in a statement he was impressed with the rankings.
“This extraordinarily strong showing attests to the Harvard Law School faculty’s deep commitment to research and the scholarly enterprise,” Manning wrote.
Sunstein previously placed high in a 2016 study by professors at the University of St. Thomas Law School examining the frequency of law review article citations nationwide. That study highlighted gender disparities in citations. Of the 12 Law School professors who ranked in the SSRN top 100, only one—Alma Cohen—is a woman.

UPDATED: January 31, 2018 at 11:22 p.m.
Lawrence H. Summers was long gone from Harvard Yard when he got the call.
Robert G. Stone Jr. ’45—chair of Harvard’s 2001 presidential search committee—phoned Summers to tell him he was the committee’s first choice to serve as the University’s 27th president. Stone later flew to make the offer in person, touching down in Washington, D.C., where Summers had recently wrapped up a stint as Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton.
A week later, Summers—who earned graduate degrees and  taught at the University in the 1980s—accepted. After 10 years away from Cambridge, he would return.
Stone’s foray beyond the gates of Harvard Yard marked a somewhat unusual move for a University presidential searcher. Past Harvard search committees have often stayed close to home, pulling the University’s next leader directly from the ranks of current employees.
Four of Harvard’s last seven presidents were already on the University’s payroll when previous committees handed them the keys to Massachusetts Hall.
Nonetheless, some experts say this year’s search committee should consider candidates external to the University, those who work far from campus. These analysts say Harvard might benefit from an infusion of new talent.
The committee—which began searching for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust over the summer—may be following that advice. In December, The Crimson reported the committee had whittled its candidate pool to under 20 finalists; at least three individuals external to the University may be on that shortlist.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said in a Dec. 2017 interview that he “expects” to see World Bank President Jim Yong Kim, University of Michigan President Mark S. Schlissel, and Broad Institute President Eric S. Lander on the under-20 list. Kim in particular appears to have caught the committee’s eye—sources close to the World Bank leader say he has been in touch with the committee and is debating the pros and cons of the University’s top job with friends and advisors.
Some analysts say an external choice like Kim affords a few key advantages: A candidate with top credentials in a non-Harvard role would bring a novel point of view and might be better able to navigate federal scrutiny while wielding global clout.
The search committee likely looked at external candidates from the beginning, according to John W. Etchemendy, a former Stanford provost who has advised past Harvard searchers. 
Etchemendy—a candidate in Harvard’s 2007 presidential search—said he thinks one of the group’s first steps involved compiling a list of provosts and presidents at other universities and combing through the document for hours.
He said he thinks seeking an outsider is a smart move.
“There’s always an advantage of bringing new perspectives, and that is a genuine advantage,” Etchemendy said. “I don’t think it swamps the disadvantage of not knowing the institution or not knowing the people.”
Some Medical School professors said they also think an external candidate would be a boon to the University. They pointed in particular to the fresh viewpoint Kim would bring to the job, if the committee selects him.
“He would create some new programs that the rest of us haven’t thought of yet,” said Marshall A. Wolf, who worked with Kim at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
John G. Meara, a professor of Global Health and Social Medicine, wrote in an email in January that he thinks Kim would likely have the “courage” to take a hard look at Harvard and make the difficult changes and decisions any large university might need.
Judging by their backgrounds and past interviews, some of the University’s 15 searchers might also prefer a president hailing from outside Harvard Yard. Some members of the search committee themselves lack educational or professional ties to the University.
For example, former Princeton president Shirley M. Tilghman and recent Corporation appointee and private equity mogul David M. Rubenstein joined Harvard’s highest governing body without attending or working at the University beforehand.
“I think if you’re as important to the country as Harvard is you probably need to take a look at whether you should only have Harvard graduates doing certain things,” Rubenstein said in a May 2017 interview. “Harvard has had a number of presidents, for example, who did not go to Harvard.”
“I’m not a Harvard graduate and I hope that they’ll think there’s a plus in that because I can bring to the table the perspective of somebody who didn’t go to Harvard,” he added.
Havard’s next president will inherit a bouquet of federal and legislative challenges, ranging from a Department of Justice probe into Harvard’s admissions practices to Republican legislation that could prevent the University from enforcing its penalties on single-gender social groups.
Faust spent considerable time during the final year of her presidency in the role of congressional lobbyist, traveling to D.C. to meet with lawmakers like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
It seems likely Faust’s successor will need to do the same. Some experts say the national political climate means Harvard’s next president must be politically savvy and experienced at navigating the legislative process. An external candidate with government chops could better serve this role, some said.
“A lot of folks in the elite liberal circles just don’t understand how we can be in this situation and I don’t claim to fully understand why we are—I’m amazed by it as well,” said Rudy N. Brioché, a former director of the Harvard Kennedy School Alumni Organization. “Being able to engage it and navigate it requires someone who has a certain level of comfort with the government, with the policy-making process, and to be very much a part of that.”
While familiarity with the government might be helpful, the University’s next leader also has to be somebody whose understanding and reputation extend beyond the borders of the United States, some professors and alumni said. These criteria, too, may be more likely met by an external candidate, according to analysts.
Brioché said he wants a “globalist,” someone who has spent a lot of time in far-flung locales around the world.
“You need someone who is a globalist because that is just the reality of the world,” he said. “Beyond whether we can retrench into our corners, it has to be someone who is willing to engage—not just with the federal government but someone who is truly a globalist and is able to engage the world.”
Arthur M. Kleinman, a professor at the Medical School, agreed. Kleinman said he wants a candidate who will “globalize” Harvard.
The next president should be “committed to taking on the major issues in the world,” he said.
The line between internal and external candidates is not always clear-cut.
Often, external contenders for the Harvard presidency—those employed outside the school during the search process—previously worked at or received degrees from the University.
Harvard’s 26th president, Neil L. Rudenstine—a top executive at the Mellon Foundation when he got the nod for the University’s premier job—taught at Harvard in his thirties. Nathan M. Pusey ’28, who preceded Rudenstine, earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University, though he was working as president of Lawrence University when he decamped for Massachusetts Hall.
Etchemendy said he thinks presidential candidates who can bring both Harvard and non-Harvard experience are most likely to fill the role well.
“Sometimes you do get cases where the person… went to Harvard, or spent half of his or her career on the Harvard faculty but then went someplace else and is coming back,” Etchemendy said. “Then you do get a little bit of the best of both worlds because the person knows the institution—maybe not current players—but at least knows the institution and also brings outside perspective.”
To others, the issue of internal or external is unimportant. Some search experts and professors said Harvard’s searchers should give little thought to the extent of candidates’ prior experience at the University.
Isaac Stein, who chaired the search committee that selected Stanford’s current president, wrote in an email that he thinks the Harvard search committee should take a broad view.
“I do not believe that internal vs external is the big issue. It is just one factor in the analysis,” Stein wrote. “Even with a great internal candidate, you would still go through the full search process.”
Jonathan M. Hansen, a senior lecturer in social studies, agreed, though he took a slightly more cynical view of the process
“I always think fresh blood is nice in all institutions, but it doesn't matter,” Hansen said. “We could get someone from outside who's a disaster, we could get someone from inside who's a disaster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and two former U.S. diplomats critiqued the Trump administration’s trade policies at an Institute of Politics panel event Tuesday.
Speakers included Michael B. Froman, who was the U.S. Trade Representative during the Obama administration, and Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns. Burns previously served as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs from 2005 to 2008.
A recurring theme at the event—entitled “The Revolution in American Trade Policy"—was President Donald Trump’s frequently stated interest in renegotiating and leaving international trade agreements.
“We are going to learn a lot from this administration in terms of confronting some of the assumptions we had about the international system,” Froman said. “As the Trump administration withdraws from agreements, withdraws from leadership in various areas, I think we will see political leaders in various areas saying this isn’t necessarily the right way to go.”
Froman also discussed the effects the Trump administration’s foreign policy might have on the reputation of the U.S. government overseas.
“I think we’ve gone from what Madeleine Albright used to call the indispensable nation to being  relatively isolated as a nation, and I worry we are on our way to becoming an irrelevant nation where other parties say ‘we’re just going to wait this administration out,” Froman said. “We can wait three years, maybe seven years, but at least three years, and see what the next administration’s policies are before we really engage.”
Summers, who gave the opening remarks, specifically mentioned the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Trump’s criticism of the agreement when introducing Forman.
“[Forman] was the leading champion of perhaps most notably, the Trans Pacific Partnership, an agreement that I believed had enormous potential to advance US economic interests, but it must be said, an agreement that was repudiated by the last four standing for President of the United States: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side, and Ted Cruz and Donald Trump on the Republican side,” Summers said.
TPP is a trade deal negotiated by the Obama Administration which included the United States, Japan, Mexico and various other countries.  During his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order removing the U.S. from the agreement.
Froman—who helped negotiate TPP—expressed optimism, however, over the long-term future of U.S. trade policy.
“I don't think damage is permanent. Damage to our reputation about being a reliable partner is hard to recover from, and I think it’s going to take several administrations to try and recover from that,” Froman said. 
Attendees said that they thought the event was informative and “detailed.”
Lillka Cuttaree, a graduate student at the Kennedy School who attended the event, said she was interested in the subject because of her international origins.
“I had a specific interest in that because I come from a very small country in Africa—Mauritius—so I’m a bit worried by the way the trade policy is shaped by the current administration,” Cuttraee said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time for the Harvard men’s hockey team to take it to another gear.
The squad is cutting it close, though. With only eight games remaining in its regular season campaign, the Crimson is still in the progress of “clicking.” After last weekend’s back-to-back shutout losses, Harvard risks dropping to .500 if it falls to Ivy League rival Dartmouth this Friday.
The Crimson (9-8-4, 8-5-3 ECAC) has already played two months of its schedule at or below an even record—from Nov. 10 to Jan 6—and will look to avoid returning there as it trips up to Hanover, N.H., to challenge the Big Green (9-11-2, 7-7-1) in its only contest of the pre-Beanpot weekend.
“For us, this game on Friday night is huge,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s time that we kind of take it to another gear, and I think this is about the time where we need to find our game.”
While the team cannot ignore its pedestrian 9-8-4 mark this season, it generally feels optimistic about its play.
“I thought early on we lost some games that we could’ve easily been on the other end of,” explained coach Donato when asked whether he thinks his team has outplayed a near-.500 record. “I don’t think we’ve fully hit our stride and been able to consistently come out and play great hockey…. Whether we think our record is worse than it should be, better than it should be, that’s really out of our control right now.”
Even with this optimism, coach Donato’s message of urgency and execution has reverberated within the Bright-Landry Hockey Center early this week. Practice has been focused, and the coaching staff has nitpicked in the spirit of attention to detail.
Frustrated at its scoreless weekend against now-No. 1 Cornell and Colgate, the Crimson has just one game to rekindle the offense before squaring off against the always talented Boston University in the Beanpot on Monday. Dartmouth enters Friday’s tilt in peak form, too, so righting the ship won’t be easy.
“You got to treat them as a different team,” said tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen, comparing today’s Big Green to its early-season form. “As much as has happened to us has happened to them as well.”
The Big Green has notched recent wins versus Colgate and at then-No. 2 Clarkson, not to mention a victory at Denver, also the two-seed at the time, back in December. Harvard, on the other hand, has yet to triumph over a ranked opponent all season. That being said, a telling performance against Clarkson back in mid-January remains fresh in the players’ minds—a sort of reassurance that the Crimson can hang with the best.

“At the end of the day, college hockey is wide open this year,” Ryan Donato said. “Teams that are unranked are beating top-10 teams any given night…. Two weekends ago: 6-6 game to Clarkson, which we definitely could have won. It just goes to show that we have that ability to play like that, but we just got to find it.”
On account of last weekend’s run-ins with hot goaltenders, Harvard has dropped to 27th in the Division-I PairWise rankings, the closet predictor of each program’s NCAA Tournament hopes. While not certain, it is likely that the Crimson will need to win the ECAC Tournament in March to gain a bid to the 16-team competition. At this point, Harvard’s at-large chances are slim.
If that’s the focus of coach Donato’s squad, then conference points are of the essence.
“We recognize that having a bye in the first round of the playoffs gives you a better opportunity to advance,” said coach Donato, before hedging his statement. “Ultimately, the game on Friday night isn’t going to determine our season, nor is home-ice going to determine our season.”
Harvard currently sits in fourth in the ECAC, ahead of Colgate and Dartmouth by four points, albeit having played more conference games than both. This positioning would give the Crimson a first-round bye in the ECAC Tournament, which coach Donato alluded to.
In recent seasons, the Harvard icemen have typically handled the Big Green with relative ease—the Cambridge-dwellers have posted a 5-1-1 record against Dartmouth over the past four campaigns. This time around, though, the Big Green are not to be underestimated.
Entering Friday night’s bout, Dartmouth is playing arguably its best hockey of the season. Moreover, last year’s matchup in Hanover remains fresh in the players’ minds: the home team stunned Harvard with an eight-goal performance at Thompson Arena, dealing the Crimson one of its rare losses (six all year) in 2016-2017.
Harvard will think twice before writing off Dartmouth, even if the Crimson has already toppled the Big Green, 5-0, this season.
“These games, ones that we usually handle, have been an issue for us,” junior forward Ryan Donato said. “Dartmouth is a great team this year and has some huge wins…. Obviously we’re a little sour about the way things went last year.”
Expect Dartmouth’s attacking effort to take a team-oriented approach, as no individual accounts for more than 11 percent of the team’s point total on the season. Senior Corey Kalk leads the way with 15 points (5–10—15) but also owns a team-worst minus-13 rating. The alternate captain has just two points (1–1—2) in six career appearances versus Harvard.
“Dartmouth is a team that kind of scores by committee,” coach Donato said. “Their goaltenders have been somewhat up and down but are certainly capable of having some great games…. They’ve always played us tough.”
For the visitors in Friday’s contest, the offensive objective is simple: get one, and end the drought.
“Get as many pucks on net as we can,” suggested Ryan Donato, when asked about the team’s approach to Dartmouth. “We got to score one, and the floodgates will open.”
Last weekend was the first and only time this season that Donato was held without a point in consecutive games. The Boston Bruins prospect shoulders much of the team’s offensive burden—his 29 points (20–9—29) pace the squad—and feels the extra onus to solve its scoring woes. Linemate and fellow junior Lewis Zerter-Gossage (7–12—19), who trails Donato by 10 points for the team lead, feels it too.
“I think, as someone who gets a decent amount of ice time, you kind of have to feel the burden when the team doesn’t score at all in a weekend,” Zerter-Gossage said. “When you’re getting more chances on the power play, things like that, and you realize that it’s your job to get shots and challenge the goalie…it is kind of disappointing. But I think guys like me or Ryan or [sophomore blue-liner Adam Fox] aren’t really too worried.”
Between the pipes, Friday’s opponents are both in search of more consistency. At points in the season, Madsen (6-6-4, 2.28 GAA, .920 SV%) has played to his fullest abilities, logging three shutouts and an additional three stingy performances that saw his save percentage eclipse .960.
The senior backstop, however, has struggled to maintain the consistency that he enjoyed in last year’s record-setting campaign, forcing coach Donato to replace Madsen with junior backup Michael Lackey (3-2-1, 2.56 GAA, .907 SV%) periodically. Watching games from the bench had become a foreign feeling to Madsen, who started all 36 tilts for the Crimson last season, so the emerging battle in the blue paint has required a bit of an adjustment from him.
“Last year, it was a bit of an anomaly, starting every game,” Madsen said. “If anything, this is pushing [Lackey and me] both harder, and the fact that either one of us can start pushes us both more in practice. Guys know they can win with either of us at this point. It’s a good situation.”
Ahead of the Big Green matchup, Harvard’s situation in net is still up in the air. Last weekend, Lackey started the “bigger” game against Cornell, and Madsen started the following night. Presumably, coach Donato is still searching for the hot hand, and since both net-minders ceded two goals without receiving any run support, last weekend provided little clarity.
For the green and white, net play has also been inconsistent. Through 17 games, Dartmouth’s normal starter, senior Devin Buffalo, has posted uninspiring numbers (8-8-1, 2.90 GAA, .905 SV%).
Granted, some of Buffalo’s sturdier performances have gone unrewarded, such as a 0-1 loss to reigning NCAA champion Denver. Nevertheless, the Big Green’s average of 3.18 goals allowed per game is good for ninth in the 12-team ECAC. In short, neither goaltending nor defense is the team’s strong suit.
Instead, Dartmouth is an opportunistic team, eking out one-goal wins against some premiere competition this season. Harvard’s main goal on Friday will be breaking out of its recent offensive funk, and the Big Green’s vulnerabilities, despite its opportunism, should provide an outlet to do so.
Whether the Crimson ultimately do take it to another gear, or whether they regress to .500 once again, a loaded BU team will be waiting for the squad just three days later in the Boston hockey classic.

The Harvard women’s basketball team moved into second place in the Ivy League, thanks to a two-win weekend anchored by Friday night’s season high 97-point performance against rival Yale.
Senior guard Taylor Rooks and junior guard Madeline Raster were the offensive catalysts for the Crimson in a 97-73 win, scoring 22 and 18 points respectively, and converting on a combined 15 of 23 attempted shots from the field.
Although Harvard (11-6, 3-1 Ivy) will not play Princeton—undefeated in division play—and defending Ivy League champions Penn for two weekends, jumping out to a 3-1 conference record is crucial to the team’s hopes for a run in postseason play.
Harvard is amidst a stretch of six consecutive home games, the final two coming next weekend against Columbia and Cornell, a trend that bodes well for a Crimson team that has not lost at Lavietes Pavilion since March of last year.
DISHING AND SWISHING
Effective passing was the key to the team’s biggest win of the season. The squad dominated the Bulldogs in assists, tallying 28 on just 38 made shots. On the flip side, Harvard was able to limit Yale (9-8, 2-2) to just 24 baskets, of which only 13 of those were assisted.
Quick ball movement and good transition play was integral to Friday night’s blowout win. The team’s 28 assists dwarfed the prior season high of 22, registered in a road loss at Temple.
Raster’s fast-paced guard play was crucial to the Crimson’s high assist total, as the junior guard tallied an impressive nine assists, one shy of a double-double to go along with her 18 points. The nine assists were a career high for Raster, surpassing her previous high seven assists against Eastern Michigan two years ago.
Sophomore guard Katie Benzan also played a key role in Friday night’s ball movement, chipping in six assists, two more than her season average. Friday’s performance was even more impressive for the sophomore from Wellesley, Mass., considering the foul trouble that limited her to just 25 minutes, well shy of the 33 minutes she has averaged this season.
LONG-DISTANCE CONNECTION
Harvard shot nearly 50 percent from three-point range in the first half, and a mammoth 64 percent for the game by the time the final horn had sounded. That mark far exceeded the previous season high of 48 percent registered in a road win at Northeastern.
Raster and junior guard Sydney Skinner led the aerial assault, combining to knock down 8-11 three-pointers. Skinner’s performance was particularly impressive, as she came off the bench to hit four of five three pointers, finishing the game with 18 points in just 23 minutes.
Rooks chipped in as well, converting both of her three-point efforts, a part of a 9-for-11 performance from the field. Despite her foul trouble, even Benzan got in on the act, knocking down three of her five attempts from downtown.
The Crimson’s sharpshooting accuracy was impressive on a night when Yale’s three-point shooting started with promise, but culminated in a 23 percent mark, one of the key differences on a night when Harvard beat Yale by 24 points.
BATTLING DOWN LOW
Friday’s contest pitted sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm against the Bulldogs’ star junior forward, Jen Berkowitz. The Yale forward, a native of Wayland, Mass., leads the Ivy League in shooting at 57 percent, a distinction she also held last season.
Although Berkowitz finished with a respectable 19 points in 30 minutes, the Crimson were able to limit her for most of the night, and many of her points came after the win was secure.
Boehm, who scored 10 points in a 20-minute performance, was able to stymie Berkowitz on the defensive end. Harvard was able to frequently double-team and disrupt the star forward, forcing her to commit three turnovers, and holding her to no assists.
Freshman Jadyn Bush also played a crucial role in limiting Berkowitz, coming off the bench and playing 15 minutes of tough, poised defense. Bush registered six rebounds in her limited spell, and she—along with Rooks who snared nine rebounds—were crucial in winning the rebound battle over the visitors by a 40-36 margin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not very often that Harvard women’s squash doesn’t come out on top. This week was no different in terms of the team’s outcome, sweeping games against No. 9 Drexel and No. 3 Trinity, but the entrance was new.
Due to weaker strength of schedule, the Crimson (8-0, 3-0 Ivy) dropped from its No. 1 position atop the College Squash Association (CSA) rankings and ceded ground to newly top-ranked Princeton.
This set Harvard up with a Monday afternoon away matchup at the Bantams home court, facing a team that had won three straight games the prior week against top-five teams in Stanford, Yale, and Penn. Circumstances did not favor the team from Cambridge carrying a 45-game win streak into the contest, with the Bantams (10-2) certainly angling to play the spoiler.
“It’s always a little bit more pressure just going into a new environment, that you just don’t really know what to expect,” co-captain Alyssa Mehta said. “But I think we kind of prepped for that in and of itself.”
HARVARD 8, TRINITY 1
Playing in an elongated fashion with only a couple of matches going on at a time, the Crimson quickly built up a 4-1 lead to put the Bantams in a deep hole. But as it went down, the Bantams could have looked to their own devastating loss earlier in the season to Princeton for inspiration. Trinity had built up its own 4-1 lead in that matchup, but the host Tigers swept the match’s third wave as part of its current undefeated campaign this season.
That hope would soon fade away as Harvard went to sweep the back half of the matches en route to a resounding victory over the Bantams, which boast their own set of four All-Americans to match the Crimson’s.
“Basically, I think what it came down to was mental preparation and just having a really hard-fighting attitude going into the match, and I think we covered the mental side of the game very well,” Mehta said.
Harvard’s top three—including juniors Sabrina Sobhy and Kayley Leonard and sophomore Gina Kennedy—took care of business easily, as each swept their respective opponents in three games. This dominant top of the lineup will present a special challenge against top competition. All three have played as the No. 1 in matches this season, and they are a collective 21-0 in individual matches.
But star power is only as good as the entire team. National finalists last year, Penn has languished to a 5-3 record this year even as two-time individual national finalist Reeham Salah has remained undefeated. The good news for the Crimson is that its depth has shown up consistently.
Co-captain Sue Ann Yong was the only Harvard player to lose, falling to first-team All-American Vanessa Raj after winning the first two sets, while playing in the sixth slot on the ladder.
No. 8 junior Sophie Mehta and No. 9 freshman Hannah Craig both swept their match-ups in three games. Three other matches went to four games, and the Crimson players were able to stave off their opponents in all of them. But it’s no coincidence that Harvard did well in its tightly-contested matches.
“So, we’ve been doing a lot of practice matches during our practice times to get us into competitive shape,” sophomore Eleonore Evans said. “It’s the best way to put us under the most pressure.”
Evans said that winter training put a strong emphasis on cardio and strength conditioning to set up the competitive season.
“We still have a lot of that work put in and so I think we are all in pretty good competitive shape,” Evans said. “This was the perfect opportunity to test it and I think we are all pretty pleased with how we looked out there.”
HARVARD 9, DREXEL 0
When a top-10 team comes into the building, you play attention. With a high-ranked team like the No. 2 Crimson, there is always the opportunity of an upset. Usually, at least.
In the niche of collegiate squash, however, that is not the case. There was no upset, there were no matches, or even games that Drexel (5-7) came away with. In a Sunday matinee, Harvard swept the Philadelphia, Pa., team in straight games across the board.
The Dragons were no match, putting up no more than eight points in any single game. The Crimson has had a lot of the sort recently. The skill level is just simply higher for Harvard.
As the number two ranking indicates, the Crimson has relatively glided through the season with easier opponents. They had a whole month between the first and second games of the season. There is a legitimate question to be raised about falling behind as the others battle forward.
But after beating the country’s third and fourth  ranked teams in Trinity and Stanford while dropping just one match combined, that has turned into a nonstarter. Harvard has reaffirmed that it is in a league of its own.
Next week, No. 1 Princeton looks to join that league as well.

Ever since Harvard imposed sanctions on “unrecognized single gender social organizations,” many groups have been scrambling to avoid the consequences and keep their membership stable with a healthy crop of sanction-scared freshmen.
Some groups have completely morphed from single gender to co-ed, such as Alpha Epsilon Pi’s shift to Aleph or Kappa Sigma’s change to KS. Others, however, have managed to slip out of reach of the sanctions while still maintaining a mostly single gender front. Kappa Kappa Gamma, now Fleur-de-Lis, bills itself as “female focused.” While it’s technically gender neutral, it’s not hard to guess about how many guys threw their hats in the ring this semester.
Flyby suggests a few other descriptions that could be used by groups who aren’t quite ready to give up their single gender status...because as long as you don’t technically limit membership based on gender, you’re good, right?
Brotherhood Bound
Sisterhood of the traveling pants? How about brotherhood of the barrel-chested sanction-battlers?
Bro-Based
This still sounds fratty enough that it might not get past admin, but it’s worth a try, right?
Matriarchally Managed
For the group that is straight up raising queens. Hey, if some guys want to come along and be knights, or, better yet, court jesters, we’ll take ‘em.
Masculine Minded
If “female focused” made it through, “masculine minded” might as well. The slogan could be “guiding guys since the sanctions’ rise.”
