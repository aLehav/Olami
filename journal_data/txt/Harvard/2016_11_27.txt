After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The line stretched along the Goodwill storefront; snaked around Burger Fi’s alfresco dining enclosure; extended past City Convenience, Blue State Coffee, and the Boston Playwright’s Theatre; and ended somewhere in front of Raising Cane’s. Had it been any longer, there would have been concertgoers in the middle of Harry Agganis Way, fighting off oncoming traffic. When the doors of Paradise Rock Club opened at 8 p.m., the people in line shuffled through, flashing IDs and receiving in return either bracelets or sharpied X’s on the backs of hands. They moved briskly into the shadowy main hall as feverish jazz spilled out of the speakers overhead, and they swarmed the edge of the stage, which had been fenced off for some unknown, worrisome reason. Onstage, what looked like two microphones muffled with cloth towered over the assorted instruments on tall, strangely angled stands. Even an hour before the show, Paradise Rock Club was packed, with many deeming the ground floor to be too crowded and therefore ascending to an upper level to watch comfortably.
They waited on Mitski, the New York-based singer-songwriter whose most recent album, “Puberty 2,” has caused anyone with ears to fall over and convulse out of awe and empathy. While Mitski has three other stellar albums to her name, her following has snowballed after the release of “Puberty 2,” primarily on the strength of its lead single, “Your Best American Girl.” An anthem about unresolvable longing, “Your Best American Girl” took ’90s alt-rock tropes (sonically, it’s just a slowed-down “Teenage Dirtbag” by Wheatus) and repurposed them into something more gorgeous and emotionally resonant than anything from that era. The rest of the album only goes in bolder directions. Full disclosure: “Puberty 2” happens to be this author’s Personal Album of the Year (PAOTY, pronounced “pouty,” or “peyote” for the more adventurous). Apologies for the gushing.
Mitski had two opening acts to warm up the crowd: Mal Devisa and Fear of Men. The former, stepping out with just an electric bass, enthralled the crowd the moment she began to perform. As her strums made ribcages and rafters rumble, Devisa sang words so weighty that they would not have been out of place at a slam poetry event. Her voice, however, was the true centerpiece of her set: At its quietest, it had a world-weariness that suggested ancient wisdom, yet it could abruptly shift into a piercing wail that transfixed everyone in the room. The second act had no such effect on the audience: Fear of Men comported itself sweetly with its shoegaze stylings, but its spacey soundscapes and lead singer Jessica Weiss’s twee vocal lines kept the audience at an emotional distance.
Two distinct half hours separated the three sets, and by 11 p.m., the crowd had grown ravenous for any hint of Mitski’s presence: Every time she scurried out to help set up the stage, she was greeted with desperate cheers, which quickly turned into laments once she retreated behind the curtains. At 11:15, Mitski finally strode out behind her drummer and lead guitarist. The muffled microphones turned out to be wrapped lamps, which the three tour mates switched on as they walked out; the blinding white light cast unusual shadows across the stage, lending it a thrillingly off-kilter feel. Mitski opened her set with a jam that drew from the Talking Heads’s brand of jittery punk before seamlessly segueing into a chugging rendition of “Dan the Dancer.” After a breathtaking performance of “Once More to See You,” she chatted with the audience, exuding calm and confidence. Holding up a medal, she explained that the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, had named her an honorary ’Poonster, before diving into “Francis Forever.”
One of the benefits of attending a Mitski show is the level of grittiness the songs attain live. On “I Don’t Smoke,” for which the white light of the wrapped lamps deepened into red, Mitski flew into her falsetto with a heartbreaking hoarseness, all while plucking heavy notes from her electric bass. With thunderous drum pad hits that seemed to physically occupy the entire club, the drummer, Casey Weissbuch, added an industrial punch to an already devastating song. Indeed, he was perhaps most responsible for fleshing out Mitski’s songs and bringing out something new and vital in them, adding an unbelievable urgency to “Thursday Girl” with his rapid fire hi-hat taps. Yet the most memorable moments involved Mitski unifying the audience through the feelings her lyrics evoked. For instance, when she belted, “Fuck you and your money” during “Drunk Walk Home,” so too did the audience, who then cheered and chuckled in pleasant disbelief. The same thing happened once more a bit later, with the line “I don’t know how I’m gonna pay rent” from “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars.”
The feelings Mitski takes as her subject are both the most dramatic and the most universal; she deals primarily with heartbreak, unhappiness, and the quiet triumph of learning to live with both. Much of the joy of experiencing Mitski’s music, especially live, lies in hearing someone give voice to such feelings so eloquently and acutely. Admittedly, a small part of the joy lies in the fantasy that if Mitski is human yet can produce such powerful art, maybe the rest of us can do the same. However, these explanations can only be arrived at later on; as one watches her in concert, any sort of thinking melts away, yielding to the overflow of emotions.
After “closing” her set with a solo performance of the always stirring “A Burning Hill,” Mitski returned with her band for an encore, a smoldering cover of “How Deep Is Your Love” by Calvin Harris & Disciples (not the Bee Gees, though that would have been fascinating). Having watched her depart once did not make the second time around any easier. If anything, the encore offered the hope that the experience might be prolonged for a good while longer. That it was already midnight and that everyone in the club had been standing for a knee-buckling four hours was irrelevant. Over the course of an hour, Mitski had offered a glimpse of the sublime, and it almost hurt to shuffle back out into the cold, dispersed now, moving towards different destinations. Yet to have had such a transporting experience superseded any subsequent sadness.

The very title of Netflix’s new series, “The Crown,” suggests the importance of the institution of the monarchy to the Queen as it is. Crowns are primarily interpreted as the physical object the ruler wears, although in her case not without difficulties. The first season of “The Crown” explores the private life of Queen Elizabeth II during the first few years of her reign. Created by Peter Morgan, the writer of 2006 film “The Queen” (which also focuses on the second Queen Elizabeth, albeit in the context of Princess Diana’s death), the sumptuously shot drama humanizes the monarch and paints a psychological portrait of the royal family that seems to capture its essence but is not exactly compelling.
“The Crown” boasts, for the most part, strong performances, an important aspect of a show that focuses largely on personal relationships and beliefs among the Windsors. Claire Foy’s young Elizabeth, played with restraint but less distance than Helen Mirren in her Academy-award winning turn in the same role, is outstanding. On the other hand, John Lithgow ’67 as Winston Churchill and Alex Jennings as Edward VIII both offer performances that fall on the campy side of the spectrum. There have been many good cinematic (or televised) renderings of the former British PM; Lithgow, in comparison, initially overemphasizes the mannerisms of the flamboyant politician, perhaps the most important character on the show beside the young Queen and arguably also the most interesting one. However, the cranky cartoonishness eventually develops into a truly complex figure, to which the penultimate episode, “The Assassin,” greatly contributes. Jennings plays the abdicated King Edward with enjoyable malice. Matt Smith of Doctor Who fame also delivers a good performance as the slightly laddish Prince Philip, whose relationship with his (higher-ranking) wife becomes increasingly strained as she takes on more responsibilities in her role as Queen. The gender dynamic between Queen Elizabeth and her powerful male contemporaries is one of the recurring themes of the show, and its treatment of the issue is laudable. “The Crown” seems aware of the tension, but it remains true to the Queen’s rather stoic character by mostly avoiding that tension’s verbal expression.
The royal family is a potentially fascinating subject, and “The Crown” is obsessed with the machinery of the monarchy. The show pays very cinematic, almost excessive attention to social machinery at the micro-level: It abounds in shots of countless operators involved in the flow of information travelling between dignitaries or their subordinates’ behavior. Perhaps the most telling such detail takes place off-screen, when removing a bit of fluff from someone’s jacket reveals the affair Princess Margaret is having with a divorced man (scandalous!). The extremely high production value contributes to such moments, which produce the same kind of pleasure as some Wes Anderson films, rather than rendering them tiring. Given the show’s enormous $100 million budget, the show’s aesthetic expectedly looks lavish, but the hazy blue tones through which the luxurious locations are shot reinforce the cold atmosphere of the royal family’s life.
“The Crown” also succeeds in exposing the human side of the often glamorized and still mysterious family. This grounding happens early on through shots of King George, Queen Elizabeth’s father, being operated on, in a scene reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh’s “The Knick.” The bodily aspects break up the antiseptic early atmosphere, but the show also focuses on Elizabeth’s deep dedication to tradition and her role as an impartial monarch who simply upholds the constitution under all circumstances. However, this impartiality to politics means that potentially more interesting subjects, such as issues of colonization and the Cold War, are mentioned just in passing—they were never something she actively got involved in. Although her decision not to intervene in almost any way results in less interesting television, it is historically accurate.
Unfortunately, the show is unconvincing and at times almost ridiculous when it tries to suggest that the importance of the Queen is ever much more than symbolic. It’s probably not entirely true that Churchill only stayed in power because of her request—the dedication to tradition in his case seems like a false claim.
One of the show’s episodes focuses on the issue of televising Queen Elizabeth’s coronation ceremony—Prince Philip correctly assumes the general public wants to know who the family is. Several decades later, however, much of their enigma seems to be gone. “The Crown” occasionally fails to convince the audience to care about the outcomes of crises beyond the personal that the Queen faced, since her influence did not seem to extend far beyond that.

Anna Kendrick, star of “Into the Woods” and “Pitch Perfect,” recently joined the growing club of celebrity authors with her debut memoir, “Scrappy Little Nobody.” Her edgy wit and instinctive sass (her Twitter account is living proof), however, beg to be recognized in their own right, separate from the world of ghost writers and self-admittedly semi-literate A-list actors. Still, is she ultimately just another celebrity posing as a novelist?
Kendrick is obviously not a writer: Odd attempts at wisdom close chapters of random anecdotes, sentence structure is often overly simplistic, and an outside hand (or thesaurus) seems to have thrown in obscure words in an attempt to refine the tone, making for some choppy passages and transitions. But these imperfections of her writing, along with her unabated candor and relatable frustrations with friends, boys, and money, make her memoir true to her and her voice. It overall succeeds in its purpose to humanize Kendrick as just a “normal” person, one who still gawks at the price tags of shoes, hides stains under rugs, and likes boys who don’t like her back.
She writes her memoir through a collection of autobiographical essays, starting with her childhood. With disclaimers that she is “not kool“ and “a very, very small weirdo,” she sets a consistent tone of playful self-deprecation. However, these initial chapters comprise the weakest part of the book. Her sarcastic interjections, meant to poke fun at the inevitable awkwardness that is adolescence, interfere with the content of her stories, which itself is interesting. When she recalls her experience playing Tessie from “Annie,” for example, she interjects, “We sang ‘It’s the Hard-Knock Life’! We did a dance with tin buckets and scrub brushes that was bursting with adorable scrappy rage! We got to embody the rollicking fun of being orphans!… So maybe I still had too much energy—they’re adding a TAP number?! Let’s go learn it!” Perhaps her humor does not deliver on paper as desired, or she attempted to match the immature banter of childhood (albeit with an abundance of expletives), but either way, her stories would have fared better without the added commentary.
But the beauty of her stories is Kendrick’s ability to normalize otherwise esoteric situations. Yes, she had an agent and a full-time acting job at the age of 10, but she also cleverly conveys both her unusual boldness at school and her normalcy among “crazy child actors”—a relatable sense of feeling different and not quite belonging. At age five, she got her start in acting when she performed a Shirley Temple classic at a recital but forgot the lyrics halfway through, stoically concluding to her mom, ”Well, that was stupid.” As she navigated the theatrical world full of “freaky” child actors—including a boy who complimented her name for its “syllabic symmetry”—she developed an aversion to precocious humble-braggers and arrogance. Her dislike of vain entitlement persists: After defending that she went to Payless to buy “respectable shoes” when she was 10, she apologizes, “I have been around rich people too long, and it has made me defensive.” Moving from theater to a movie career—a transition that could’ve used more explanation—her new celebrity status did not go to her head. Even as she donned thousands of dollars of diamonds on her neck, she still came home to a “squalid” apartment with Ikea furniture. She describes her double-life: “I grew more fearful that my filthy secret would spill out: I am—at best—a normal human, and this has all been a misunderstanding. A lot of people were devoting a lot of energy to maintaining the illusion that I was the ready-made ingenue. It made me feel disingenuous and guilty. I was participating in a con.” Here was a “normal” person who had somehow found her way to fame and was expectedly confused but was, in the public eye, just another celebrity.
Her fears of being “discovered” seem to stem from her intriguing attempts to cling to her humanness and all the struggles and mistakes that come with it. She writes, “I want to be a real person, even if that person wasn’t so great to begin with. I want to always be able to say, Hey, I’m not incompetent because I got famous, I’m incompetent because I’m a pathetic waste of humanity.” Thus, her memoir gives a glimpse of the diversity of the celebrity experience as she faces the repercussions of her own fiery independence and refusal to succumb to the norms of fame, including “being nice.”
Readers shouldn’t expect nor be disappointed by the lack of “good” writing, because in short, Kendrick is not a writer, nor does she pretend to be one. It is her alacrity to show herself in a realistic light that differentiates this book from the genre of celebrity glamor. Her final chapter, a satirical take on book club questions, epitomizes the interactive and lively nature of her book overall. The last question reads, “Anna makes a lot of bad decisions. Can you think of a time when you’ve made a bad decision? Oh wow, really? We’re gonna pretend you can’t think of a single example? YOU THINK YOU’RE BETTER THAN ME?!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allyson R. Perez ’17 was climbing into bed in her room on campus when the text message flashed across her screen at 1 a.m. Saturday: Fidel Castro was dead. Perez, who is Cuban-American, did not believe it.
“There have been so many false alarms over the years that I remember, so I was a little skeptical at first, and I waited to make sure,” Perez, a North Carolina resident, said. “But it was real. It was hard to go to sleep after that.”
Castro, who ruled Cuba as the country’s “Máximo Lider” from 1959 until 2008 and defied 11 American presidents along the way, died Friday. He was 90.
Among Harvard’s Cuban-American students and faculty, Castro’s death inspired reactions ranging from jubilation to ambivalence. 
Some in Cuba revere Castro as a revolutionary hero who guided the small island nation to global relevance, and as a strong leader who never submitted to the demands of the U.S. government. Others see him as a repressive and power-hungry despot who tried to control every aspect of Cuban life, down to the color of Cuban soldiers’ uniforms.
Castro inspired socialist insurgencies across Latin America and brought the Cold War to the Western Hemisphere with his successful overthrow of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Later, Castro nearly pushed the world to the edge of nuclear war.
To Marlon Seijo ’18, Castro’s death was cause for celebration. Seijo was back home in Miami, Fl. for the Thanksgiving holiday, attending a late-night reunion with a few high school friends, when he heard the news.
“We were all hanging out, and it came out at 12:41, some time around then,” he said. “People were excited about it, talking about it, people had gone out into the street.”
Thousands of Cubans–including Seijo’s parents and several of his grandparents–fled the island and came to America when Castro took power in the ’60s, fearing political retribution. Seijo said the vast majority of students at his high school were Cuban-American.
Seijo drove home early that morning and woke his parents to tell them Castro had died. Both had to check major news outlets before they believed him, Seijo said. Once Castro’s death “hit them,” neither could go back to sleep, so Seijo and his family stayed up to celebrate.
Seijo said the mood in the “Cuban exile community” in Miami was ecstatic Saturday. Though few expect immediate change in the Cuban government going forward, many Cuban Americans in Miami see Castro’s passing as a “symbolic victory” marking the beginning of a transition to a “new era,” according to Seijo.
“I think that’s mostly why people here are celebrating,” he said. “[My family] went to a Cuban restaurant for lunch, a Cuban cafe for breakfast. I think we’re all just being extra Cuban today.”
For other Cuban-American Harvard affiliates, Castro’s death led to mixed emotions. Both Perez and government professor Jorge I. Domínguez, who was born in Cuba and serves as the co-chair of the University’s Cuban Studies program committee, said Castro’s career and legacy permit multiple interpretations.
Domínguez said he learned of Castro’s death Saturday morning but had to double check because he is “used to fake news” nowadays. Deeming Castro a “world historical figure” of almost mythic proportions, he said Castro’s record can be polarizing.
“For many, he was a great leader who transformed his people, who adopted a variety of policies that were very successful in construction of a modern nation,” Domínguez said. “For others, he was a demon who ruled ruthlessly and sent tens of thousands of political prisoners to jail.”
“It’s not someone about whom one renders an easy judgment,” he added.
Perez agreed, terming Castro a “divisive” figure.
“There are people who will say that he is the worst thing that has ever happened to our country, and others who will point out all of the good things that he brought to Cuba,” she said.
Perez noted Cuba’s high literacy rate and its universal healthcare system as two of these “good things,” but emphasized she thought Castro was a dictator who “killed and imprisoned” people he disagreed with, including members of her own family.
Cuban-American Flavia Cuervo ’18, though critical of Castro and his legacy in Cuba, said she also felt conflicted in wake of his death. For Cuervo, the past day has been “strange,” surreal, and “weird.”
“It’s kind of a very anti-climactic moment, where there’s some sort of relief of, this is a great thing that has happened because now you feel kind of better about all the atrocities,” she said. “But then you’re also like, ‘Yeah, but I don’t feel better.’”
Perez said the most fitting word to summarize her feelings on Saturday is “complicated.” She paused for a minute, searching for a different adjective.
“It’s complicated,  it’s complicated,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 27, 2016, at 12:45 p.m.
With the way that freshman defenseman Adam Fox had been playing to start his first season in Cambridge, it was only a matter of time before he notched his first career goal. And on Saturday night, the breakthrough finally came as Fox, the assist leader for the Harvard men’s hockey team, opened the scoring against local adversary Bentley.
Fox found the back of the net during a power play, after the puck deflected out to him following a scramble in front of goal. His low wrist shot beat two defenders as well as the goalie before settling in the bottom right corner of the net, giving the No. 9 Crimson its first lead of the game and setting the tone for the remainder of the contest.
The rookie additionally went on to tally two assists to take him to a total of 10 for the season. Co-captain and center Alexander Kerfoot also had himself a night, recording a career-high four assists against the Falcons, giving him 10 on the year as well.
On the strength of Fox’s and Kerfoot’s playmaking, as well as another strong performance by sophomore winger Ryan Donato, Harvard (6-2-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) came away with a comfortable 5-2 victory in front of its home fans. Bentley (3-6-3, 2-4-2 AHC), which could not find the same intensity that produced impressive wins at UNH and Air Force earlier this year, will look to put the loss behind it when it resumes conference play next weekend.
“We didn’t want to take our feet off the gas pedal after facing BU and BC,” Kerfoot said. “It’s always easy to get up for those games, but I think the team responded well today, getting the lead early and holding it throughout the game.”
After sophomore winger Lewis Zerter-Gossage tacked on a second goal at the end of the first period, Harvard never led by less than two scores. The team made sure to deliver a swift response to the Falcons’ first goal too, as freshman winger Nathan Krusko tipped a Clay Anderson blast into the back of the net to make the score 4-1 right before the second intermission. Like Fox, Krusko was recording the first goal of his collegiate career.
“It was important to have an answer there to go back to the locker room at 4-1,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Their goaltender was making a lot of good saves in the period, and to convert one of our chances at the end there was mentally a bonus for us.”
The Crimson held its three-goal lead for a majority of the final period, but just as the story has been for much of the season, penalties hurt the team and threatened to make the game close. Four different Harvard players were penalized in a nine-minute span, giving Bentley multiple chances to get back into the game. The Falcons finally converted with less than three minutes remaining, but by then, it was too late to mount a comeback.
The Crimson did show improvements on the penalty kill, however, killing five of the six power plays it faced on the night. These situations included a minute of 5-on-3 play and another minute of 6-on-4 action. The team responded well both times, even adding an empty-net goal courtesy of senior Sean Malone during the 6-on-4 at the end of the game.
“It’s a work in progress, definitely,” Donato said. “It was frustrating to kill off the 5-on-3 and then come back to give up another one. It’s been small mistakes that have given other teams one opportunity too many, and we’ll continue to work on fixing those.”
On the other side, the power play was a strong point for Harvard, as was the play of the first line led by Kerfoot. The Crimson scored twice on the power play against Bentley and three times when the majority of skaters on the ice were from the first line. Ryan Donato was named the game’s First Star for his wrap-around goal and two assists.
After the comprehensive win, the team now has a week to review its performance and prepare for a difficult road trip. St. Lawrence and Clarkson await in upstate New York before Harvard can enter its December break.
“It’s good to get back in the win column heading into next weekend,” Kerfoot said. “Those two games will be huge, especially with how those teams have been playing. They’re definitely ones that are marked on our calendars.”
GAME NOTES
—Senior forward Phil Zielonka made his first appearance since Feb. 8, playing on the third line alongside sophomore Michael Floodstrand and junior Jake Horton. Floodstrand was making just his second appearance of the season.
—Junior goaltender Merrick Madsen made 32 saves, one shy of his season high.
—Both teams logged 34 shots on goal, but Harvard out-attempted the visitors, 68-57.
