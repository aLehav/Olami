After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, a bipartisan group of four senators introduced a bill that, if passed, could impact the lives of many in the Harvard College community.
The Immigration Innovation Act of 2013, unveiled on the same day that President Obama proposed a framework for comprehensive immigration reform, aims to increase the number of work visas given to foreign nationals with advanced degrees from 65,000 to 115,000. It also exempts holders of advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from the annual cap on green cards.
To start, the bill is plain good economics for the country. It is an indisputable fact that technology and human capital drive long-term economic growth. However, despite the United States’ dominance in high tech industries, the country’s education system falls behind other nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in STEM graduates. This gap between the supply and demand of highly skilled workers is filled by foreign workers, two-thirds of whom are STEM graduates. Before the education system can satisfy the labor market’s demand, the bill will, as the senators put it in a press release, “[ensure] the United States can maintain its competitiveness in the global economy” by keeping foreign talent in competitive fields.
The bill would also have tremendous effects on the personal lives of international students at Harvard. Under the current immigration laws, international students make large sacrifices in their careers. Since work visas typically cost employers more than $5,000 and have a high rate of rejection, only the largest and most resourceful corporations can afford to hire international students. As a result, international students with technical skills that are valuable to the economy often resort to taking offers in finance and consulting rather than with the engineering start-ups that their skills are more suited for. Some advanced degree holders are effectively enslaved by their employers, as their legal residence in the U.S. depends on their employment. Giving foreign advanced degree holders more flexibility in options will free them from this unbalanced employment relation and allow them to fully use their scarce and desired skills in the economy.
Despite the great benefits of increasing visas and lifting the green card cap for advanced degree holders, Senate Democrats rejected a bill with similar intent after it passed the House vote. The disagreement was over another part of the bill that aimed to eliminate a lottery visa program, which randomly selects the same number of visa applicants from countries with low immigration rates to ensure a diversity of new Americans. The bill also drew official opposition from the White House for not meeting the objectives of President Obama’s comprehensive immigration reform plan. Even though there was no opposition from either party to keeping more foreign advanced degree holders in the country, this sensible bill fell apart in the midst of partisan bickering.
The failure of the previous bill showed a lack of commitment to this issue by both parties. This is perhaps because foreign students, with no votes or resources for lobbying, hold no power in national politics. The most vocal champions of immigration reform for skilled workers have been technology companies in dire need of employees. The list of beneficiaries, however, would extend far beyond the giants of Silicon Valley. Harvard is home to no fewer than 4,400 international students, who make up 20 percent of the student population. For many international students, staying in the U.S. after graduation is a viable and often desired choice. However, under current immigration laws, international students will be denied entry if they declare an interest in staying in the country after graduation. Such schizophrenic bureaucracy can potentially turn away many capable students, who would make Harvard a more diverse place, both academically and culturally. These international students, who leave familiar environments to seek academic opportunities, already possess the intelligence and courage that characterize successful entrepreneurs. If these students stay in the country more often, they will surely contribute to the reputation and success of the University in the long term.
The Harvard community has been an advocate of social progress for the least emancipated members of society. It is time that Harvard takes an active stance on immigration policy to ensure a more stable future for its students who do not (yet) have the right to vote. With the support of Harvard and other educational institutions, politicians will hopefully take these issues more seriously. With friendlier policies in Washington and a public reputation as a place that cares for its international students, Harvard could be an even more attractive place for the world’s brightest.

It is a modern American truism: College is too expensive. Four years of Harvard College tuition costs roughly triple the median American’s 2010 net worth. And yet, according to the federal government’s newly unveiled “College Scorecard,” a Harvard education is comfortably cheap. That conclusion stems from a net-cost analysis (tuition minus grants and scholarships) for students receiving financial aid: an average tally of $18,277. Unfortunately, while that calculation anoints Harvard as the Ivy League’s cheapest school, this case proves one in which popular knowledge (that college is too expensive) outdoes the raw numbers’ suggestion. Harvard’s net cost is one bright but flickering spot, cast against a grimmer backdrop of painful college expenses, a challenge that the federal government should address.
Before launching into that discussion, the accomplishment behind the $18,277 number deserves some plaudits. A genuine round of applause for a concerted effort by the College and alumni to make a Harvard education affordable and for a recent trend of decline in average net price—15.5 percent over 2007-2009. A round of applause for keeping student debt at a minimum, $88.61 per month versus other Ivy League figures all in the triple digits. And a round of applause for beating Yale.
But bear in mind that those numbers miss the makeup of the Harvard student body, one of the nation’s richest. U.S. News places Harvard sixth among its Top 25 Universities in Pell Grant percentage, a useful proxy for economic diversity. Yet that ranking says little about a school in non-relative terms. Zooming in on Harvard, per the Admissions Office’s factsheet, 20 percent of students’ families have incomes below $65,000, an automatic trigger for full financial aid. That means incomes in Harvard’s bottom quintile span the United States’ bottom three (the third tops out around $62,000), something less than a paragon of equity. Harvard’s Scorecard cost is as much a function of its students’ circumstances as it is of institutional efforts or innate munificence.
Not every American college shares those circumstances. Instead, nationwide growth in college costs have consistently outpaced inflation. The typical American student graduates with nearly $27,000 in student loan debt; the typical Harvard aid package contains no loans, with grants in lieu of them. This is not to gush over Harvard’s progress—it is to show that, nationally, something needs to be done. In particular, the U.S. federal government should prioritize investment in education.
In pared-down economic terms, that investment makes sense. Research here at Harvard has found that in recent years, labor market demand for college graduates has outstripped supply. The historically high college wage premium is a sure call for more graduates, which federal funding can engender. Education investment is a key element for long-term economic growth.
Beyond supply and demand curves, however, education funding can also address inequality and opportunity. Specifically, Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, authors of the study above, attribute 60 percent of the growth in wage equality between 1973 and 2005 to increasing returns for education. Investment, of course, is needed long before college (rich-poor achievement gaps originate much earlier), but it should certainly persist throughout. And as an additional sign of potential, research suggests that college’s benefits are strongest for poorer students.
Socioeconomic mobility has long stood as a storied American promise. Today, education, not merely legal protections, is the modern bulwark against ossification. Our government’s budget should better reflect that.

News about government policy is usually dominated by reports of debt crises, health care bills, or congressional gridlock. Every news story seems to foreshadow inevitable, lurking catastrophe, and every policy decision and government directive is undermined by negative connotations, debate, and future prospects. Government appears broken, dysfunctional, and without any long-term vision.
But every now and then, we will hear about an initiative that should transcend petty political complaints and deep-seated differences. In his State of the Union Address on February 12, President Obama announced the Brain Activity Map project, a proposed $3-billion research project to explore the workings of the human brain. Initiatives like BAM are emblematic of the kind of lasting legacies political leaders can leave, with intangible, yet powerful effects. BAM and other scientific endeavors should hold more authority as policy initiatives that could dramatically impact health, social, and political policies for decades to come.
The Brain Activity Map is modeled off of the Human Genome Project, which revealed new insights into genetic code and yielded valuable research techniques and potentially landmark implications for the treatment of diseases. In a similar manner, BAM seeks to create the first comprehensive map of the human brain and the signals and neural networks that make it function. The project, if successful, would not only bring us closer to understanding some of the most enduring mysteries of human existence, but a brain map could also help us develop new scientific fields like neural nanotechnology and help scientists better understand the circuitry of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer’s, depression, and schizophrenia.
Some remain skeptical that the initiative is a wise investment. The proposed budget is expected to call for $3 billion to be spent over the course of a decade. Many question the economic wisdom of investing so many federal resources in one research project, and some scientists worry it will come at the expense of funding for other valuable scientific endeavors. The project’s goals, they argue, are too lofty, their focus too vague, and their potential yields uncertain.
However, a centralized federal effort to understand the brain is the way to unite policy and science and promote human progress beyond the immediate and proximal concerns of most political debates. Beyond helping us satisfy our innate human desire to understand the nature of our thoughts and the secret, mysterious processes of our minds, this research could have lasting impact on the lives of every citizen. We can develop better treatments and policy measures to help an aging population cope with dementia. We can devise new approaches to mental health care and to how we deal with mental illness. Some have even suggested that BAM could help us form more effective policies to win the war on drugs by exploring the brain of an addict. The possibilities and implications are vast.
Social policy isn’t the only policy realm that would be impacted by BAM. Like the Human Genome Project, BAM also serves as an economic stimulus. The Human Genome Project cost $3.8 billion over 13 years, but it more than compensated for the expense by generating $796 billion in returns and 310,000 jobs. Not all scientific studies enjoy the success and economic impact of HGP, but researchers working on BAM believe economic returns are likely, especially considering that research techniques could lead to improvements of technology and potentially lower technological costs in the future. Harvard biologist George M. Church, who will be heading the BAM project, expects the brain map to be as profitable as HGP, if not more so, and the research could jumpstart new, job-creating fields in science and technology.
Intrinsically, humans are explorers. It is part of our nature to delve into the unknown, to search for answers and to reach for unseen heights. We should not forsake the future for the present. As President Obama said in his State of the Union address, “Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.” The social and economic promises of a project like BAM are enormous, and they hold symbolic value, as well. We have cured diseases, traveled to the Moon, worked to unravel the very essence of our genetic makeup, sent a rover to Mars, and seen pictures of a planet surface 130 million miles away. The brain is the next, perhaps most important, frontier, and investment in exploration, scientific understanding, and progress is exactly the kind of legacy our government should seek to leave behind.

Besides their ages, Philip Roth and Pope Benedict XVI would appear to have little in common. The mischievous, secular, and oft-profane Jewish-American literary provocateur and the sophisticated theologian, the staunchly traditional Bishop of Rome, seem cut from entirely different cloth. But each of these men recently made rather surprising announcements that were remarkably similar: They were retiring, stepping down and away from occupations that have historically been considered lifetime positions. In so doing, they have forced us to reconsider basic assumptions about vocation, career, and the management of a life.
Sometime in the late summer or early fall of this year, Philip Roth detached a Sticky Note from its fellows, scrawled a note to himself, and stuck it on his computer. For those responsible enough to utilize such mnemonically responsible props, they can help remind us to send e-mail, or meet a friend for coffee, or start thinking of the first chapter of our thesis. For Roth, it was a different kind of reminder, not to do something, but to stop doing what he had been doing for nearly half a century, nearly better than anyone else: writing fiction. In an interview with Charles McGrath of the New York Times, Roth read the note out loud to an America whose fictional sense of itself he helped fashion. It read like this: “The struggle with writing is over.”  Such renunciations of literary activity are more common than they might appear to be. Shakespeare famously retired back to Stratford-upon-Avon after writing “The Tempest” in 1610-11, and Harper Lee has not written a book since “To Kill a Mockingbird” in 1960.  The Pope’s play is a little more unusual, not having happened in 600 years or so.
Of course, Roth, like Shakespeare and unlike Lee, was no one-hit wonder. From “Goodbye, Columbus” to the epochal “Portnoy’s Complaint” and through the Zuckerman trilogy and such late masterpieces as “Sabbath’s Theater” and “American Pastoral,” Roth has had an illustrious career. But what interests me is this notion of a “career,” and more specifically what our writers, celebrities, and spiritual leaders owe us.  Most recently and infamously, the NFL quarterback Brett Favre was widely denounced for continuing to play past his prime, for mistiming his exit cue and imposing his eroding skills on a public weary of his waffling career plans. Michael Jordan somehow managed to retire both too early and too late, leaving to play baseball at the peak of his NBA career and then returning to play basketball when he was no longer the same player. Perhaps we react so strongly to these decisions because they are tied to the body’s capacities and failings. We understand that to succeed as a professional athlete requires a breathtaking measure of grace, coordination, and strength, gifts vouchsafed to the young. The decline in those metrics that comes with age can be unseemly and can seem terrifyingly tangent to our own fears of hurried mortality.
In some ways, Roth’s decision to “hang up” his computer or Benedict his staff is analogous to the proverbial spikes. Just as much as shooting a basket or throwing a pass, the qualities of inspiration and composition and spiritual fervor tend to favor the youthful. The glories of both Wordsworth and Whitman date to an initial effervescence of creative force. Keats was dead at 25, and John Kennedy Toole wrote “A Confederacy of Dunces” before his 30th birthday. William Butler Yeats and Wallace Stevens both produced substantial poetry late in life, but they are the exceptions that prove the rule. We expect writers to write continually. They owe us their insights and their books at regular intervals, to read and write papers about or maybe just place on our bookshelves.
Benedict and Roth thought differently, however, realizing that the profession of immortal truths is contingent on the possession of bodily strength, a perishable commodity. At moments when purpose and ability converge, the world feels commensurate to our aims, and its scale is congruent with our own. Both Roth and Benedict began to feel the balance tipping in the other direction, and the receding overlap between who they were and what they hoped to accomplish. It is fortunate that both of them thrived in fields that were always somewhat adjacent to inactivity; the still of prayer and the solitary isolation of the consumed reader always undergirded their more public iterations. Both faith and art are things you do alone and hope others can share. Finally, they both ask of us a final measure of devotion that is also a valediction.
I vividly remember a visit by the Nobel Prize-winning author V.S. Naipaul to campus last year. Naipaul’s “A House for Mr. Biswas” is among my favorite novels. I asked the 80-year-old writer a question about the experience of writing the book. He refused to answer, a decision I only later understood. For me, the book was powerfully and emphatically in my present, reaching and teaching me with a powerful immediacy. For Naipaul, the book was an artifact 50 years old, a lifetime ago. Great works of art or the spirit can partake in a perpetual contemporaneity. Unfortunately, the men and women who make them adhere to a less leisurely chronology. Sometimes, one, or two, of them might want to step away from it all, leaving us a little in the lurch, but also a little in awe.

As extreme weather dominates the headlines, a recent report co-authored by environmental science professor Michael B. McElroy suggests that climate change is a threat to national security.
The report, co-authored by McElroy and D. James Baker, a former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, examines the short-term implications of climate change on the existing infrastructure and the impact of a polarized political dialogue on national security overall.
“If the richest country in the world regards the climate issue as the matter of a vote, a left-wing or right-wing vote, and is not prepared to talk about the facts, then we are not prepared to provide the leadership this world deserves,” McElroy said about environmental policy disagreements among lawmakers.
The other issue highlighted in the report is the government’s lack of preparedness for severe weather conditions.
In the report, New York governor Andrew Cuomo emphasized the importance of having reliable infrastructure when Hurricane Sandy left significant damage to the Eastern seaboard last October.
“We have a new reality when it comes to these weather patterns,” Cuomo said in the report. “We have an old infrastructure and we have old systems, and that is not a good combination.”
The publication also described the increase in high-impact weather conditions and unusual climate phenomena, saying “their extent is worldwide, affecting people where they live, where they draw upon fresh water resources, and where they grow food.”
“In the case of New York City, did anyone really predict that a storm surge of more than 20 feet could envelop lower Manhattan?” McElroy said.
Part of the report focuses on the Hadley Circulation, a weather system in which air travels north after losing much of its moisture to precipitation in tropical areas.
“What seems to be happening in recent years is that the input of new energy to the climate system due to what we are doing by burning fossil fuels, in particular, is energizing the system,” McElroy said. “It is more energetic than the tropics, so it is going higher and further north than it normally does.”
The result of this new energy input is an extension of the desert environment, which could potentially envelop Spain, Italy, Greece, Israel, and the Mid-Western United States.
“I’m hoping that by what I do at Harvard—talking about this issue with undergraduates who are going to be policy leaders—we can make a difference,” McElroy said. “Scientific literacy is important for people who are going to be Economics, English, or whatever concentrators. We all need to have an understanding of the world, where it came from, and where we are going.”

Students can now download an unofficial version of their academic transcript to send to summer internship or graduate school programs.
Each student can now access their unofficial transcript under the Campus Resources tab on the my.harvard website, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke. The document, which can be downloaded as a PDF file, looks just like a student’s official transcript, but does not have Burke’s signature. Unlike the online student record that is also available under the Campus Resources tab, the new unofficial transcripts will list full course titles instead of abbreviations.
Udai Bothra ’16 said that having access to transcripts online would save students time when going through application processes, especially since most students request one by the end of their sophomore year.
“It’s a good idea,” Bothra said. “It will just be a lot more convenient.”
Before this change, students seeking transcripts had to order an official copy from the FAS Registrar. The Office of Career Services said that students often resorted to using the online student record file when applying to summer internship or fellowship programs.
“The issue is that [this student record] is not really designed for the outside world,” Burke said. “People wouldn’t see the course titles, and they saw all this code about whether you’re meeting your requirements.”
While the online student record contains symbols unrecognizable to individuals outside the University, the unofficial transcript clearly indicates how many courses have been passed.
The move to make unofficial transcripts available online was prompted by students from the Undergraduate Council and Graduate Student Council, who suggested the idea to Burke when he was first appointed as FAS Registrar in Jan. 2011. Since his appointment, Burke has said that improving online services would be a priority.
“This is a great example of collaboration between the administration and student advocates,” said UC Education Committee Chair Darragh Nolan ’15.
Though the new feature was officially released early this month, Burke said that the Registrar did not immediately announce the news to the student body so that they could first ensure its functionality.
Though no formal announcement has been made, Burke said 652 students have already accessed their online unofficial transcript since it was launched.

With only a few days left for Congress to avert sequestration, University President Drew G. Faust will travel to Capitol Hill this week to sound the alarm about across-the-board budget cuts that would likely slash millions of dollars in funding for Harvard researchers.
“What made the trip feasible and timely was the threat of sequester,” said Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications.
Congress has until Friday to reach a deal to avoid sequestration, automatic cuts to the budgets of both defense and non-defense federal agencies. Without such a deal, Harvard’s researchers, who received a total of over $650 million in fiscal year 2012 from the federal government, will be forced to find ways to offset the drastic cuts to their sponsored revenue.
Starting on Wednesday morning, Faust will meet with Congressional leaders and freshman representatives from both parties. She will also lobby members of the Obama administration, including military officials.
In these conversations, Faust will warn leaders of the harmful effects that she believes research funding cuts have on the nation’s intellectual and innovative vitality, which she has said in the past is closely linked with the health of the economy.
Sequestration threatens to trigger “a 10-year reset of American priorities,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications.
Casey said that in addition to arguing against sequestration, Faust will push for a “growth agenda to help innovate our way out of the deficit.”
“Research universities might be providing a resource that is part of the solution,” said Casey, who is Harvard’s chief lobbyist. “We like to be a resource to members across both sides of the aisle.”
Faust’s research advocacy trip to the Capitol this week will be far from her first. In 2008, after five years of stagnant research funding from government agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, Faust testified on the Senate floor against reduced federal funding for academic research.
Faust’s previous visits to D.C. have also included conversations with business leaders and executives from other universities intended to “broaden our work in coalitions,” according to Casey.
In addition to her talks with politicians this week, Faust will attend an event at the Library of Congress, an announcement of a Civil War project by the American Repertory Theater and the National Theatre, and a lecture and question-and-answer session at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

The Cambridge Police Department has released new details about a Saturday morning report of a gunman on MIT’s campus that authorities now believe was a hoax.
In a Tuesday press release, CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello confirmed that the department received the false report via an internet relay, an instant messaging service usually utilized by people who are unable to communicate by regular telephone.
Riviello added that CPD has since been in contact with Sprint, the service provider of the internet relay, which helped CPD to identify a preliminary suspect. According to Riviello, that initial suspect has been cleared of suspicion.
CPD is continuing to investigate the origin of the suspected hoax, and is prepared to press charges against the originator of the false report if that person is found, Riviello wrote.
Riviello also wrote that CPD has been in communication with the MIT Police Department, the FBI, the United States Secret Service, and the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office as it proceeds with its investigation.
On Saturday, the report of a man with a “long rifle and body armour,” as described in an MIT emergency alert, prompted a campus-wide lockdown. After receiving the report at  7:28 a.m., CPD responded by scouring the building in the Main Group complex on MIT’s campus where the gunman had reportedly been spotted. But after the room-by-room search yielded neither a gun nor a gunman, CPD called off its hunt, and the campus lockdown was lifted at 10:45 a.m.

Panelists Sean Penn, former Haitian Prime Minister Michèle D. Pierre-Louis, and General P. K. Keen headed a discussion Tuesday night about post-earthquake recovery in Haiti at the Harvard Kennedy School JFK Forum. The panelists, moderated by Public Policy Professor Mary Jo Bane, agreed that although Haiti has made much progress in the three years following the disaster, it still needs more time to reach and surpass its former level of economic development.
Pierre-Louis started the discussion by remembering Haiti before the earthquake. “If you look at the figures, Haiti was climbing gradually,” she said.
Still, all three panelists expressed optimism about the nation moving forward.
“The difference between the Haiti I landed in and the Haiti today is extraordinary,” Penn said. “More miraculous is the fortitude of the Haitian people.” J/P Haitian Relief Organization, the non-profit  organization for which Penn serves as CEO, employs over 300 Haitians, runs one of the largest camps for displaced civilians, and works to remove rubble from destroyed areas.
“There is not a begging culture—the main thing they’re gonna ask you for is a job,” Penn said, adding that the little money most families spend generally goes toward schooling their children. Monetary investment in education would have the largest impact on economic growth and recovery, Penn said.
Keen commented on the need for the United Nations to establish a national police force that Haitians would respect as a symbol of authority. That said, he and the other panelists admired the recent peaceful transfer of power—something that happened for the first time in Haiti in 1996—even in the midst of such a devastating event.
Pierre-Louis also raised the issue of college-educated Haitian citizens leaving the country upon graduation. She insisted that there was social mobility in the country and encouraged expatriates to return to and improve their country.
Penn responded to questions that implied his organization is interfering too much with rebuilding affected areas, and that J/P HRO should leave tasks such as the rebuilding of the National Palace to the Haitian people. Several times throughout the discussion, he stressed that the image the media painted of J/P HRO’s work and the lack of progress of the country as a whole was incorrect. The organization’s work, Penn said, is aimed at “sustainable change” to mobilize Haitians to improve their cities, and that first-hand accounts like his own are “the only unequivocal evidence.”
Penn closed by saying that three years is still too soon to properly gauge the recovery.
“The realist will look at the next 15 years,” he said.

Students gathered for Harvard Speaks’s first event of the semester on Tuesday night, where undergraduates delivered presentations on topics ranging from disaster in Madagascar to a time management iPhone app. Harvard Speaks—a speaker series that hosts undergraduate students to speak to each other about their passions—was founded last semester.
“Every student here is so incredible with a wonderful story to tell,” co-founder Eliza L. Malkin ’13 said. “This is a chance for Harvard students to get an opportunity to be heard, to grow as a community, and get a sense of their fellow students’ passions.”
In addition to giving students a platform to speak about issues, Harvard Speaks was also created to spread awareness of charity organizations. Every student speaker chooses a charity to support, and ties their speech into the charity’s mission. The group hopes to have an event each month this semester.
Danamona H. Andrianarimanana ’13, the first speaker, talked about her home country of Madagascar. After recent political strife left the formerly flourishing nation in crisis, Andrianarimanana got involved with organizations to help rebuild and rejuvenate her home country.
“It is easy to destroy. Rebuilding is harder, whether you’re rebuilding a project, a dream, or a country,” Andrianarimanana said. “No matter what happens, I will never stop trying,” she added.
After Andrianarimanana, speaker Jalem D. Towler ’15 addressed the issue of self-love in a spoken word performance.
“We’re all struggling with something. A lot of that for me was love,” Towler said. “Love lifted me, and it can lift everyone else in this room.”
Another speaker, Peter G. Machtiger ’14, gave a presentation on Team Rubicon—a veteran service organization that uses disaster response to help reintegrate veterans into society. According to Machtiger, inadequate disaster response and inadequate veteran reintegration are two problems that can solve each other.
Former speaker and event attendee Kristina Saffran ’14 said Harvard Speaks brings valuable perspective to participants.
“It’s a really great way of getting to know your fellow students and being reminded of how impressive your peers are,” Saffran said.
The event ended with group leaders thanking all attendees and encouraging people to apply to be speakers.
Every speech that is given is videotaped and uploaded to the Harvard Speaks YouTube channel for others to enjoy. Students can apply to speak themselves or fill out an application for a fellow student they would like to hear speak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior Gary Power and the Harvard Men’s Squash team clinched the victory in the CSA semifinals on Saturday, earning him the title as Athlete of the Week. Here in Cambridge, however, some other Crimson athletes were able to compete to a level good enough to merit recognition by The Back Page as Athlete of the Week Runners-Up.
 
Adabelle Ekechukwu, Women’s Track and Field 
 
For the first time since 2000, the women’s track and field team was victorious in this year’s Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Junior co-captain thrower Ekechukwu broke the 2002 record for women’s weight throwing by more than two meters on the first day of competition with a 20.83-meter throw. Additionally, Ekechukwu was awarded the Field Most Outstanding Performer award by the Ivy League this weekend.
Nico Weiler, Men’s Track and Field
Weiler beat his personal best and 2012 meet record of 5.3 meters in Saturday’s meet when the senior pole vaulter cleared the bar with a 5.38 meter jump. Out-vaulting his competition by more than half of a meter, Weiler helped lift the men’s team to third place in the Heptagonal Championships.
Ben Glauser, Men’s Track and Field
The sophomore thrower brought in 16 points for the Crimson this weekend when he came in third in the shot put and first in the weight throw. In the weight throw, he surpassed his competition by nearly a full meter. Though short of the meet record, Glouser’s weight throw topped his 2011-2012 personal best by just under two full meters.
 
Victoria Lippert, Women’s Basketball
 
After scoring 24 points against Brown on Friday to help Harvard to a 77-71 win, the senior forward put up 19 points the following night against Yale. Lippert’s 24 Saturday points were just four points shy of her career-high that she set in her sophomore season against Colombia.
Christine Clark, Women’s Basketball
 
Clark achieved the first double-double of her career Saturday against Yale with 20 points and 13 rebounds. The Crimson defeated the Bulldogs, 69-66, in a sold-out showcase at Lavietes Pavilion. The night prior, the junior guard added 16 points against the Bears. Women’s basketball has won its last eight games played at home, four of which were Ivy League contests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the sun set on Tuesday evening over Soldiers Field Stadium, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team gained an early lead and held on tight, defeating Holy Cross, 16-12, for its first win of the season.
Offense won the day for the Crimson (1-1) as it made its biggest mark in the first quarter, with goals scored by senior midfielder Alex White, junior attackman Peter Shwartz, freshmen attackmen Devin Dwyer and Sean McDonagh, and midfielder Brendan Newman, all of which went unanswered until the last minute of the quarter. With 34 seconds left in the frame, Crusaders sophomore attackman Clay Haarmann scored his first of seven goals (1-2), just four fewer than his total goal count last season.
Shwartz collected two assists and four goals in the game for Harvard, leading his team in scoring en route to his first collegiate hat trick.
White, who had a hat trick against UMass on Saturday, repeated the feat on Tuesday with three goals and two assists.
“Offensively, we were spot-on in terms of shooting,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “We rode very hard. We won face-offs, played hard all over, and buried our shots.”
But things didn’t stay positive for Harvard in the second frame. The team’s 10 shots on goal in the first half fell to seven in the second, while Holy Cross jumped from two in the first to 17 in the second. The Crusaders outshot the Crimson for the rest of the game, finishing with 39 shots on goal to Harvard’s 32.
“We had trouble defensively slowing them down,” Wojcik said.
“We were erratic in our clearing game,” he added, noting the Crimson’s 11 successful clears in 17 attempts.
Harvard’s defense also struggled to keep Holy Cross out of the box, as Haarmann, sophomore midfielder Terry McKenna, and senior midfielder Myles Gillespie combined for six goals in the second quarter alone.
Haarman totalled three unanswered goals at the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second, putting the score at 6-3 with 13 minutes left in the half.
While it had fewer turnovers than Holy Cross in the first quarter, Harvard more than doubled the Crusaders in turnovers in the second, finishing the game with 24.
“It was definitely a pretty sloppy game,” captain Jason Gonos said. “Offensively, we put goals up, [but] defensively, we didn’t do a good enough job of stopping them.”
Gonos added a tally himself at 12:49 in the second quarter when he grabbed a loose ball from the midline and drove up, uncontested, for an unassisted goal, the first of his career.
“I just kind of shot and it luckily went in,” Gonos said.
Shwartz added an unassisted goal for the Crimson, which was quickly answered by a score from Gillespie with the assist coming from Haarmann, who then went on to score twice more in a four-second span. McKenna finished off the Holy Cross run with an unassisted goal at 0:29 in the half, making the score 9-7.
Going into the second half with a fragile lead, Wojcik knew what needed to be improved if his team hoped to secure the home victory.
“We had trouble with one vs. one [scenarios], combined with us turning the ball over in the clearing game, [and] giving the ball back [to Holy Cross],” he said.
The Crusaders came out fired up after their five unanswered goals, a streak which continued with an unassisted goal from McKenna through senior goalkeeper Harry Kreiger’s legs. But with the score 9-8, Holy Cross would get no closer.
 
Harvard converted on third-quarter goals from junior attackman Daniel Eipp, White, Shwartz, Dwyer, and junior midfielder Brian O’Toole, who, along with Newman and Gonos, scored his first career goal on the day.
“We have a big roster of talented players,” Wojcik said. “We wanted to get more guys more game experience.”
Harvard is currently in in the midst of a three-game, eight-day stretch, so keeping first-string players healthy and rested remains a high priority.
Gillespie added two goals for the Crusaders in the third frame, sending his team into the fourth quarter trailing, 15-10.
The final frame was low-scoring for both sides. Holy Cross added two more goals from Haarmann, both unassisted, while Eipp added one last goal for Harvard to make the final score 16-12.
“We had a strong defensive game [on Saturday], and today I thought offensively we were strong, but we weren’t who we are defensively,” Wojcik said. “We have yet to play a complete game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 7 Harvard women’s ice hockey team closed out its regular season with a fifth straight win over Yale, 3-1, to clinch a share of the Ivy League title on Tuesday night at Bright Hockey Center.
The Crimson (21-5-3, 17-3-2 ECAC), which last won an Ancient Eight championship in 2009, will split the conference title with Cornell.
“You have opportunities to win things throughout the year,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “It doesn’t just happen through February—it happens in every game you play. We put ourselves in a position to win an Ivy title and share it with Cornell. That’s a great thing for us. It’s nice to have that for our seniors and everyone else in the program.”
The Bulldogs (5-21-4, 4-15-3 ECAC) were held to just 12 shots on goal, the same number that they registered when they hosted the Crimson in a 4-0 Harvard shutout on Nov. 3.
Knotted at 1-1 after the first two stanzas, Stone’s team knew the third period would be crucial in determining if it would finish the season on a positive note.
“Everyone was pumped in the locker room going into the third [period],” freshman forward Mary Parker said. “We knew we were tied and it was a big moment. We had 20 minutes left to make a statement and roll into Dartmouth this weekend. We were all excited and wanted to work hard and do our best.”
Four and a half minutes into the closing frame, sophomore defenseman Michelle Picard found senior forward Kaitlin Spurling on the left side of Yale’s attack zone. Spurling drilled the puck, off Picard’s assist, past Yale goaltender Jaimie Leonoff for a one-point advantage.
Leonoff made 35 saves through a contest during which she found herself under a constant stream of shots from Crimson skaters.
“Their goaltender played really well for them, hat's off to her.” Stone said. “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of good looks at the net. There were scrambles in front, so she did a really nice job managing her area.”
Nearly 14 minutes later, in front of an empty goal, Parker slapped a fast shot from the neutral zone and found the back of the net to put Harvard up, 3-1, with just 92 seconds left in the contest.
“[Parker is] playing hard and she’s earning everything she’s getting and that’s great,” Stone said. “Sometimes you get those empty netters, but for sure she earned her empty netter tonight because she played with a lot of grit. She killed a lot of penalties and she played great d-zone.”
The goal was Parker’s second of the night and fifth this month. Almost six minutes into the first period, the rookie sent an unassisted puck flying into the goal past Leonoff from the top of the right circle.
“[Before] the first goal, I was coming off the bench,” Parker said. “[Junior] Lyndsey [Fry] and [co-captain] Jillian [Dempsey] were working really hard in the corner and the puck popped out. I just went in and tried to get towards the middle and take a shot. I was pretty lucky there.”
The Bulldogs responded about six minutes later with a goal of their own. Senior forward Natalie Wedell tried to slip the puck in past the Crimson’s senior goaltender Laura Bellamy. Bellamy rebuffed her attempt but was unsuccessful at stopping Bulldog forward Patricia McGauley, who was assisted by Wedell and sophomore defenseman Madi Murray.
The puck stopped there for Yale, which went scoreless for the rest of the contest. The rest of the team’s play was dominated by an inability to penetrate Harvard’s offensive zone and a rash of penalties.
The Bulldogs picked up four penalties, while the Crimson notched five infractions. Neither team was able to convert on its power play opportunities.
“It was a hard fought game today,” Stone said. “We had to really dig in at the end and find a way to win. Certainly we’re psyched. Our kids have been earning this all season so it’s nice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kicking off its non-conference season at the Florida Atlantic Classic this weekend, the Harvard softball team has big shoes to fill.
The reigning back-to-back Ivy League champion made its mark at the end of last season, when it became the first team from the conference to win a game in the NCAA tournament since 2005.
But when the Crimson takes the field in Boca Raton on Friday, it will be with a decidedly different—and younger—starting lineup.
After graduating pitcher Rachel Brown—who led the Ancient Eight in strikeouts—and infielder Jane Alexander—who started all 50 games and closed out the season with a team-high .381 batting average—Harvard will look to its 13 freshmen and sophomores to fill the void.
“That was a really strong senior class,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “There was strong leadership and they had just grown so much. This team is an underclass-heavy team…but probably one of the hardest working and fighting teams I’ve ever had.”
Of the six teams participating in the Classic this weekend, Harvard is the only one that has not yet begun its season. Florida Atlantic University (5-9) has participated in three tournaments since the beginning of February and this will be the third consecutive competition it hosts.
Taking the field on Friday morning, the Crimson faces Jacksonville (10-4) and Ball State (6-3) in back-to-back games. The Dolphins jumped out to a strong start at the Panhandle Invitational and have suffered their only losses at the hands of nationally ranked opponents. The Cardinals have participated in two tournaments and hold a winning record, relying on a strong offense that has outscored its opponents, 77-31.
“We kind of have an idea of a couple of lineups that we’re going to want to look at this weekend,” Allard said. “We hope to give everyone some experience playing. I think the goal in the first weekend is to get out there and compete and see what we still need to work on.”
On Saturday, Harvard will have a more balanced schedule, playing Eastern Michigan (2-3) in the morning and host Florida Atlantic University in the evening. The Crimson’s match-up against the Eagles will be only the second in program history, with the first coming in a 5-1 loss in 2009. Eastern Michigan has looked to seniors Katy Blaharski and Courtney Nicholson—each batting .429—for a majority of its offensive output thus far this season.
Despite their losing record, the Owls have been in a number of close games and, along with Michigan State, have the most on-field experience since opening their season in early February. Sophomore pitcher Samantha Messer—fresh off a two-hit complete game last week—leads a strong Florida Atlantic pitching staff that has held its opponents to a .259 batting average.
In its first tournament of the year, Harvard will look to explore its pitching options. Coming in without an established rotation, the Crimson has a number of options to replace Brown, including returning sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz, freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula, as well as senior Jess Ferri—a utility player who pitched as a freshman.
“[Ferri has] made some really good adjustments this year,” Allard said. “We’re hoping to get some work out of her. We don’t necessarily have a starting rotation, but we have four pitchers ready to go who can help the team.”
Before returning to Cambridge on Sunday, Harvard will face Michigan State (8-6) in the final game of the weekend. The Spartans have come away with winning records in their last two tournaments behind starting pitcher Kelley Smith, who leads the team with a 2.20 ERA.
The five-game tournament will be an opportunity for the Crimson’s six freshmen to play at the collegiate level for the first time. In addition to the two pitchers, the class includes catcher Rachel Halperin, outfielder Zoe Galindo, and infielder/outfielders Haley Davis and Alyssa Siegman.
“They’re a competitive class,” Allard said. “They came in a little unassuming, but when they were bought into our off-season training program and our conditioning and our lifting program, they had so much improvement and growth.”
Traveling south to warmer weather, Harvard will be able to play outside for the first time this season.
“I think we want to just work well together as a team and just feel what it feels like to play a game again,” said junior co-captain and outfielder Shelbi Olson. “We’re mostly just excited to get on a real field and play on the dirt and the grass, in the sun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matt Birk ’98 faced long odds to achieve NFL stardom and reach the top of the football world. Harvard had produced just 15 NFL players since 1935, and even after the Minnesota Vikings selected him with the 173rd pick of the 1998 NFL Draft, he faced an uphill road to success in a league nicknamed “Not For Long.”
Fifteen years later, Birk beat the odds and went out on top, announcing his retirement on Feb. 22 after making more Pro Bowls—six—than all but four players drafted in 1998 and winning Super Bowl XLVII on Feb. 3 as the starting center for the Baltimore Ravens.
The two-time All-Pro is arguably the most successful NFL player to play for the Crimson and is just the second Harvard player to win a Super Bowl.
Crimson coach Tim Murphy, who coached Birk during his time at Harvard, saw his success coming.
“I’m not surprised at all that Matt made it in the NFL,” Murphy remarked. “What is truly amazing, though, is that he has become one of the best players at his position on the planet.”
JOE MAKES HIM PRO
Hailing from St. Paul, Minn., Birk arrived in Cambridge to a team that had gone 3-7 the previous season. Murphy came to campus the same fall and the pair helped engineer a turnaround that culminated in a 9-1 record and Ivy League title in Birk’s senior season in 1997.
“Matt probably improved more as a player and an athlete in his four years than any other kid I’ve ever been around,” Murphy said. “He basically willed himself to become an NFL-caliber player.”
The center took his game to the next level entering his senior year, and he credits much of his improvement to a new offensive line coach, Joe Philbin, who is now coach of the Miami Dolphins.
“Going into my senior season, I thought it would be the last time I’d ever play football,” Birk said. “So I really rededicated myself that off-season, but the biggest key was that they hired Joe Philbin as the offensive line coach. I learned so much from him.”
Birk progressed so far that he began to catch scouts’ eyes.
“One day, I asked a scout, ‘Do you really think I have a shot at this?’” Birk recounted. “He said, ‘Yes, you do.’ So that’s when I really decided to go for it and went full speed ahead.”
At the season’s end, Birk earned All-Ivy League and All-ECAC first team honors and became the first Crimson offensive lineman to be drafted since Roger Caron ’85 in 1985.
HOMETOWN HERO
After his hometown Vikings selected him, the sixth-round draft pick spent his first two seasons as a backup on the squad’s offensive line, where he learned from the team’s stars.
“The Vikings didn’t need me to play right away as they had a great offensive line with multiple Pro Bowlers,” Birk said. “I got to develop and learn, and then [before the 2000 season,] All-Pro center Jeff Christy went to Tampa Bay, and it was an open competition for the starting center position. And I won it.”
Once Birk broke into the lineup, he never looked back. He was selected to the Pro Bowl and the All-Pro team in his first season as a starter.
His success was especially sweet because he made his mark as a member of his childhood-favorite team.
“It was a dream come true to get my shot with the Vikings,” Birk said. “It [was] already a dream to play in the NFL, but when you’re playing in front of your hometown and your family and friends, it makes it that much better.”
The Harvard alum made six Pro Bowls, tying Mick Tinglehoff’s franchise record for a Minnesota center, in seven seasons spanning from 2000 to 2007—he missed all of 2005 with an injury.
In 2009, it was time to move on, and the veteran signed with Baltimore. He made 112 consecutive starts with the Ravens to end his career—the last of which came in Super Bowl XLVII.
MAN OF THE YEAR
Birk has also made a large splash off the field through his community work.
“To me, the thing about Matt is not the football accolades,” Murphy remarked. “It’s what everybody thinks about him as a person. To be named NFL Man of the Year among all of his peers tells you that what he does outside of football has had even more impact than what he’s done on the field.”
Birk is highly respected by his former teammates—he was named Minnesota Vikings Man of the Year every year from 2002 through 2007. In 2011, the center received the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year award for his promotion of literacy among at-risk youth through his HIKE Foundation, which he founded in 2002.
The foundation partners with school districts to promote literacy through programs that reward kids with incentives for out-of-school reading and ensure that children are provided with books.
Birk understands the opportunity he was given to make an impact in the community.
“The platform that football provides you in front of young people is pretty unique,” he said. “I thought that there must be a way to try and do some good with it…To be recognized with an award named after Walter Payton was a huge honor.”
“ALL THE STARS LINED UP”
The NFL’s physical game eventually wears every player down, and entering his 15th season this past fall, Birk was ready to soon retire.
“We were texting towards the beginning of December when the Ravens were in a slump,” Murphy recounted. “He told me, “Coach, you always said that if I was going to hang it up, you would want to know when. I feel like this is the time.’”
But the Ravens had plenty of fight left in them to ensure that the careers of legendary linebacker Ray Lewis, who also retired this off-season, and Birk did not end with a whimper.
They began an improbable roll through the playoffs, eventually reaching Super Bowl XLVII, where they withstood a furious second-half comeback by San Francisco to hold on for a 34-31 triumph.
“That’s the way you want to end your career,” Birk remarked. “To be on a team that had what it takes and to be able to accomplish that goal in your last year—it’s like all the stars lined up right.”
But part of the Pro Bowler was not entirely sure whether to retire, and he didn’t make his final decision until the post-parade confetti had settled.
“Every year you re-evaluate how you feel, where your family is at,” he said. “I was torn a little bit, but I just followed my heart. I considered myself to be a blessed man and that it was time to move on.”
According to Murphy, the next stop for Birk will be the Harvard Athletic Hall of Fame, which he will enter this spring.
For now, Birk is a free man—free from grueling off-season training and free to spend time with his familyand has no regrets.
“I’m just going to pour my time and energy into my family right now,” he said. “I’m just fortunate to have played with so many great players. Being able to win the Super Bowl is as good as it gets and it’s a heck of a way to end my career.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2012 was not an easy year for the Harvard baseball program.
The team went just 12-30 during the regular season, finishing second-to-last in the Ivy League.
On July 31, Joe Walsh, who had coached the Crimson for the previous 17 seasons, passed away from a heart attack in his New Hampshire home, leaving the community in mourning.
And now, three of Harvard’s four top hitters from a year ago—junior shortstop Jake McGuiggan, senior second baseman Kyle Larrow, and junior outfielder Jack Colton—are no longer on this year’s roster. Their departure has cost the squad a pair of All-Ivy standouts in the former two players—who respectively hit a team-high .352 and .350 last season—while Colton was second on the team with 49 hits.
The other of those top four hitters and the Crimson’s only first-team All-Ivy recipient, senior infielder Jeff Reynolds, graduated and was drafted into the New York Mets organization.  Also absent from this season’s squad is junior Steven Dill, who had the fourth-most at bats for Harvard last year.
On the pitching side, things are not much better. The team’s 2012 appearances leader, junior Zack Olson, is no longer on the roster, nor is classmate Joey Novak, who was second in innings pitched and games started a year ago. Senior starter Brent Suter graduated and was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers, while sophomore captain Andrew Ferreira left the squad after being selected by and signing with the Minnesota Twins.
“It’s been a rough year for us,” senior Robert Wineski said. “[But] the team has really responded well. I think it really brought us closer together. It’s a very tight-knit group this year, more than any other team since I’ve been here. We’ve got [26] guys and we’re all pulling on the same rope.”
Indeed, 2013 marks a fresh start for a squad whose makeup is very different than that of its predecessors.
“The team is very excited,” junior infielder Carlton Bailey said. “We have a lot of new guys [and] talent, and with a new coaching staff, we’re really excited to see what we’re capable of.”
The changes start at the top, where Bill Decker takes over the program following 22 seasons at the helm of Trinity.
It will undoubtedly be a challenge for Decker to win in his first season at the Division I level, as his roster features just three seniors and 10 freshmen amongst its 26 players.
But Bailey said that since taking over, the new manager—who won a Division III National Championship with the Bantams in 2008—has instilled a work ethic that the Crimson did not previously have.
“We’re held accountable for what we do at a higher level,” Bailey said. “Coach Walsh was great. He was a great guy [and] all of us loved him, but Coach Decker reestablished a disciplinary code that all of us hold ourselves to.”
That code will be tested by a daunting non-conference schedule that kicks off this weekend against Bucknell and No. 22 Virginia, the latter of which has started its season 7-0. The calendar also features non-conference games against Ohio State, No. 12 Rice, and Houston, among other opponents, before Harvard moves into league play.
“All it does is help us, coming into Ivies, that we’ve seen top-caliber Division I teams,” Bailey said. “It really prepares us for [conference play].”
Bailey, who hit .304 in 92 at-bats last season, ranks among the team’s most accomplished returning players. Sophomore outfielder Mike Martin led last year’s squad with 12 steals and 26 runs and tied for the team lead with three home runs.
On the mound, sophomore Baron Davis—third on the squad with 13 appearances in 2012—and senior Matt Doyle, second on the team with 14 games pitched last year, registered respective ERAs of 3.14 and 3.57.
The Crimson is thus focused on looking towards the future and the players it now has, rather than the past and the ones it has lost.
“Yes, we miss those guys, but at the same time we have to do our own thing with what we have, and we all think that what we have is definitely strong enough to win,” Bailey said.
“We’ve been working really hard in the bubble the last few weeks,” Wineski added. “We have a great chance to be very successful this year, and the team’s very excited. We’re just ready to go outside and play baseball.”
The Class of 2016 is expected to make an immediate impact as well.
“Since we don’t have the numbers we usually have, they can’t sit back and develop for a few years,” Wineski said. “They’re all going to get a lot of playing time.”
The new talent and the unity that has grown out of the past year’s adversity has led Harvard to believe it can compete in 2013, despite the losses it has endured.
“People are writing us off,” Wineski said. “But we’re going to surprise people.”

Harlem Shake: if you've seen one, you've basically seen them all.
Well, not quite.
Over the past few weeks, the Harlem Shake has been making its way around the Harvard community. But the current viral videos stem from an original Harlem Shake, choreographed by a dancer named Al B. It was first known by that dancer's name—"the Albee"—before being christened the "Harlem Shake."
We checked in with some of Harvard's experts to learn more about the original Harlem Shake.
"It was a dance, not a song," said Glenda R. Carpio, a professor of English and African and African American Studies at Harvard.
Kellie C. Jackson, Harvard College Fellow in the Department of African and African American Studies, remembers the real Harlem Shake as something different from the current viral videos. "It was a shoulder shake dance," she said. Jackson referred to the reinvention of the Harlem Shake as "wild, chaotic, and crazy."
For Carpio, what strikes her the most about the original Harlem Shake is the connection between the dancers. "There is a real sense of community in that there are individuals performing and having solos while the rest of the group watches and takes turns, very much like any hip hop street dancing," she said. "I think in the parodies, what is lost is that sense of community."
Pfoho begs to differ.

With blocking form submissions just around the corner, the next week will be a very stressful time for many freshmen. In order to try and help combat the unavoidable blocking anxiety, here are a few dos and don'ts that every freshman should follow.
 
Do: Rank your potential blockmate on a numerical scale from one to ten. Make sure to take into account a variety of components that factor into their overall value as a person. Some factors to consider are their personality, their sleep schedule, their physical appearance, and whether or not blocking with them will increase your street cred. It is also advisable to post these rankings in a public place—such as your entryway's bulletin board or your Facebook status—just to ensure everyone is on the same page.
 
Don't: Be accepting of your possible blockmates' weird living habits. These "quirks" such as skyping their dog and speaking to it in a Mickey Mouse voice or having a public appreciation for the band Nickelback may seem tolerable or even charming. But when the sounds of these pastimes transform into the haunting and torturous soundtrack that you fall asleep to at night, you will think differently.
Do: Present your possible blockmates with a series of tasks and critically assess their performance. Ask them to prepare you a meal, give you a back massage, or tell you a joke. Ask them what tricks they can do. The importance of knowing what each blockmate really brings to the table is paramount—you don't want to be surrounded by mediocre comics, subpar chefs, and people who can't properly execute a standard cartwheel for the next three years.
Don't: Foster hope that people will change. This concept is a lie that has been told to freshmen for eons in order to pacify them into submission. The flawed creatures you see before you are as good as they will ever be. Lying to yourself will do you no favors and probably result in a slow and painful realization process in the (possibly very near) future.
Do: Seriously consider floating. If it feels like your only hope, it probably is.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
WHAT IT IS
According to the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), Vassar College gives new meaning to the term "liberal" arts. The religious organization (frequently referred to as a hate group) has dubbed the private college in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. an "Ivy League Whorehouse" and is set to protest there tomorrow (February 28). An announcement on the WBC's website, tactfully entitled "godhatesfags.com," proclaims that the group will protest the school for being "champions of whoredom" and having partaken in a "fag agenda."
 
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
The WBC may fight their battles with nasty name-calling and picket lines, but college students have one of the most impervious weapons known to the 21st century: social media. Current students, alumni, and LGBTQ allies worldwide have taken to the internet to defend the liberal arts "whorehouse," referring to it as such themselves in an attempt to lighten the otherwise rather grim situation. Even though the protest isn't set to happen until Thursday, online media outlets took note of the commotion following its announcement earlier this month. Buzzfeed published 22 of the best tweets and statuses made in response to the WBC's announcement. My personal favorite: "Finally realizing that the Latin on my diploma reads 'Ivy League Whorehouse.'"
 
Enterprising Vassar alum Josh De Leeuw took the opportunity to solicit donations for The Trevor Project with a goal of $4,500—$100 for every minute the WBC plans to protest. At time of writing this article, the Crowdrise page had garnered more than $92,000. The Trevor Project, which draws its title from a 1998 short film, provides crisis intervention services for LGBTQ teens around the country. 
 
Recent instances of intolerance at Vassar, a former women's college that is generally considered to be a very tolerant school, have inspired students to fight back against the WBC's intolerance with a vengeance. In December, incidents of overt sexism and racist graffiti shook administrators and students alike, sparking "Teach-Ins" and committees to facilitate open conversations about the incidents. 
 
"Everyone is frankly very excited for this [WBC] event," said Vassar sophomore Claire Ashley. "I actually found out about it as soon as Facebook started going crazy with the news that the WBC had added Vassar to their protest agenda, because a friend of mine busted into my room. In light of recent racist and sexist occurrences on campus, it seems like the Vassar community is especially anxious to unite against a hate group like the WBC."
 
The WBC also protested Harvard Hillel in 2010, prompting a "Surprise Absurdity Protest," a counter-protest in which students made ridiculous signs to signal that they found the WBC's message and actions to be irrelevant and pointless. 
 
 
SO WHAT?
In 2013, it seems that our country is slowly but surely accepting gay marriage and, with it, the basic equality of all sexual orientations. The fact that the WBC still fights with such vigor, then, is extremely disheartening to me and my peers. However, the response of the Vassar community is a beacon of hope. In some ways, the prospect of the WBC's protest has led to many good things: open conversations about hate and bigotry, an onslaught of donations for notable causes like the Trevor Project, and a renewal of a sense of community throughout social media and on campus itself. College students may be notorious for being self-absorbed and superficial, but even students at so-called "whorehouses" who subscribe to a "fag agenda" care and love each other enough to defend their school and classmates when they are attacked. 
 
THE TAKEAWAY
While college students 50 years ago rallied around the Civil Rights movement, one of today's most important campus causes is that of sexual orientation equality. Harvard does plenty to support the sexual identities of its students: we have Room 13 and the Queer-Straight Alliance, and HUDS even serves us rainbow cake on National Coming Out Day. However, the fight for equality in this realm isn't a constantly prevalent matter among the entire student body. In some ways, the WBC's impending protest is a positive, then: It's re-ignited the spark we all need to donate, to counter-protest, and to put ourselves out there instead of passively agreeing that everyone deserves to be who they are, live their individual lives, and maybe even get married.
Even though groups like the WBC still exist and, under the Constitution, are allowed to peacefully protest for their ideals, the United States as a whole is taking an overwhelming step towards equality. As someone who has many friends in the LGBTQ community—as do most Harvard and college students across the country—it's hard not to look at pictures of couples finally tying the knot on the first day of legalized gay marriage in Seattle and not agree that everyone, no matter their sexual orientation, deserves to have love and happiness. 
 As of now, the WBC still plans to protest Vassar "for following the satanic Zeitgeist by professing the soul-damning lie that it is 'OK to be gay.'" They have, however, been known to cancel protests before. After the internet group Anonymous threatened action if the WBC protested the funeral of Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz, the WBC ultimately chose not to. Even if they do carry out their plans tomorrow, if Vassar students and their supporters continue their trend of tolerance, we can only hope that groups like the WBC will one day cease to protest, if only because there is no one around to propagate their hateful cause.
