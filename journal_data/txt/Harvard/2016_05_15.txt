After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Cinema replaces our gaze with a world in harmony with our desire,” says journalist Michel Mourlet—a quote that opens Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963 hit “Le Mépris (Contempt).” Fifty-three years after the film's release, Festival de Cannes pays tribute to the now-classic with a poster remastered from a still in the film, in which Michel Piccoli ascends the stairs to a roof overlooking the sea. If you come to Cannes now, you'll see this poster hanging triumphantly at the front façade of Le Palais des Festivals, where the festival is held. To its left are the stairs leading to Grand Théâtre Lumière, the biggest theatre in Le Palais, covered by the red carpet awaiting the stars. And if you climb all the way up these stairs, you will get a great view of the sea just as Piccoli did. The metaphor is clear: Through cinema we ascend to that “world in harmony with our desires,” and Cannes declares itself as the very place where this magic happens.
However, Cannes is never only about films. It's also about celebrities showing off the new fashion trends up north in Paris, millionaires hosting wild parties along the beach, businessmen making deals with artists, and actor- and actress-wannabes wandering the streets vying for the attention of producers. This year, The Harvard Crimson has sent two writers—Tianxing V. Lan ’18 and Steven S.K. Hao ’18—to the French Riviera to cover the festival, maintaining a daily blog and reviewing selected movies.

It’s not an uncommon situation: a chaotic family meal in which relatives reluctantly gather together and pretend they absolutely adore each other. Everyone prepares the food, yet no one is cooperating with anyone else; somebody is late, and somebody is too early; somebody is complaining, and another continues discussing political issues with which only he or she is concerned. But what if such a meal is in memory of the family patriarch, during which dirty secrets of both the passed and the living are revealed? What if these disputes are also somehow related to the history of a country? Director Cristi Puiu’s “Sieranevada” tells such a story.
The family in focus comprises protagonist Lary (Mimi Branescu); his wife; his sister and sister-in-law; his brother; his aunt, uncle and cousins; and his mother. They all convene for lunch in memory of Lary’s late father, but instead of tying the family together, the meal develops into a suffocating burden to all involved. For Lary, maintaining a normal life is already a full-time job—on his way to the gathering, he quarrels with his wife over whether he bought the correct dress for his daughter’s school performance and whether they should go to the department store Carrefour before the meal or afterwards. When Lary gets to the feast, things get even worse. He has to worry about the cooking, the priest being late, incessant family drama, and his own weariness.
Sometimes the unbearable burden of these trivial matters is portrayed in a distinctly visual way: In one scene, Lary is supposed to keep the kitchen door closed, but people keep coming and going, and different people have different opinions about whether the door should be open or closed. In a single long take fixed on the door frame, the audience sees Lary confused and annoyed over the lack of a resolution. Many other shots of the film are long takes, with the camera revolving around a fixed position and probing into different rooms in which all kinds of family dramas are being stirred up. After the simple idea of a memorial evolves into the logistics of putting it together, organizing the event becomes the most banal and most torturous work that hardly seems connected to its original purpose anymore. The contrast between the ideal and the actual is best illustrated by a scene where the priest, immediately following a touching ceremony, hurries to the restroom.
The film does more than depict the ugliness and indignity of everyday life. It also connects it to all the chaos that has taken place in Romania, the home country of both the characters and Puiu himself, with the rise and fall of the Communist Party in the last thirty years. The characters make casual references to historical events at lunch table and sometimes argue about ideologies. Indeed, there is a strong sense that politics is just a scaled-up version of the family drama: Everybody fights endlessly with each other without achieving anything or knowing whether they intended to achieve anything in the first place. This inefficiency applies not only to Romanian politics but rather to politics in general—one of Lary’s cousins attempts throughout the course of the meal to share YouTube videos of 9/11 conspiracy theories with the rest of the family.
However, if both everyday life and political activism are so tiring and useless, what can we do about them? The characters don’t know, and, it seems, neither does the director himself. The biggest weakness of “Sieranevada” is its complete lack of resolution following three hours of largely unvarying quarrels and frustration. What is the point of the film if it is just a representation with no ideal or conclusion? Or maybe the film does provide a salve to all the problems in the world: “You’ll be surprised by how calm people get after their bellies are full, and how quickly you forget about 9/11 after you get laid.”

In “Café Society,” his 47th directorial effort, the ever-prolific Woody Allen pays homage to the halcyon days of Hollywood, a bygone era during which the average American visited the theater at least once a week and movie stars were truly larger than life. The result is a charming and enjoyable, if thoroughly unspectacular, ode to the Golden Age of American cinema—one that teases at a return to form for Allen but ultimately falls just short.
Anchoring the film’s large ensemble cast is Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg), a young, characteristically neurotic New Yorker who, at the start of the story, moves from his home to Los Angeles in hopes of joining the ranks of the rich and powerful. There, he becomes entangled in an unfortunate and arguably incestuous love triangle between his uncle; a powerful talent agent (Steve Carell); and his uncle’s secretary the beautiful and alluringly down-to-earth Vonnie, deftly portrayed by Kristen Stewart. Such a winding and admittedly tragic narrative, filled to the brim with dramatic irony, seems right up Allen’s alley. In its execution, however, “Café Society” fails to live up to its lofty potential.
The film suffers from its considerable usage of third-person narration, provided by the director himself. What was surely an artistic decision by Allen—intended, along with its old-fashioned title cards, to give “Café Society” throwback credentials—ultimately feels like a trope, stilting the movie’s plot and jerking viewers back and forth between the action and blatant exposition. Such is particularly difficult pill to swallow given Woody Allen’s distinguished status within the romantic comedy genre; one cannot help but imagine that a veteran and master like Allen could have opted for a subtler and more seamless technique to develop his characters and his plot.
The film’s other Achilles heel is its sprawling supporting cast. Despite boasting an impressive who’s-who of comedy heavyweights, most of the film’s characters play largely tangential roles and only serve to disjoint the plot with aimless comic relief. There is Ben (Corey Stoll), Bobby’s womanizing and criminally inclined brother who kills just about everyone who offends him and buries his victims’ bodies in cement. Also present in the latter half of the film is Veronica (Blake Lively), who, despite marrying Bobby, remains shamefully undeveloped as a character. Her main contribution to the film is a short and admittedly amusing sequence in which she delights in Bobby’s Jewish heritage, describing Jewish men as “exotic.”
All of this is not to say, however, that the film is a failure by any stretch of the imagination. “Café Society” is at its strongest and most heartwarming when Eisenberg and Stewart share the screen. The two actors, having previously co-starred in a romantic capacity in both “Adventureland” and “American Ultra,” possess undeniable chemistry and showcase it superbly. Eisenberg in particular is tailor-made for the role of a Woody Allen comedic lead. His nervous and frantic eccentricity perfectly embodies Allen’s idiosyncratic brand of humor and is indeed reminiscent of the director’s own performances in his earlier films.
Courtesy of noted cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (“Apocalypse Now,” “The Last Emperor”), “Café Society” is also visually stunning, boasting the same bright and otherworldly camerawork found in other comparable period works. But the film’s many redeeming qualities are not enough to elevate it to greatness. “Café Society” is vintage Woody through and through—just not Woody at his best.

Steven S.K. Hao ’18:
For ardent fans of film, making the trip to the annual Cannes Film Festival has the air of a religious pilgrimage—a sort of cinematic mecca nestled on the beachy shores of southern France. I say this, of course, at the risk of sounding overly sentimental, but I trust that few who have had a chance to behold the affair in all of its pomp and circumstance will find reason to dissent.
At about 2 in the afternoon, I arrive at the Palais des Festivals—a sprawling waterfront convention complex and the home of the Cannes Film Festival. By then, the festivities are already in full swing—Woody Allen’s “Café Society,” the opening film of this year’s festival, had made its first press screening at 10 in the morning, and reviews are already pouring in. Walking along the beachfront, I make my way past rows of classy brasseries and brand-name retailers before arriving at my apartment. Even during the day—and an overcast one at that—the otherworldly razzmatazz of Cannes is undeniable.
Upon ridding myself of my baggage, I quickly proceed to registration. I am handed my press badge—the key to Cannes—before queuing up for the afternoon re-screening of “Café Society.” I am almost an hour early, but I have been told that such measures are more than necessary: Not all journalists are equal at Cannes, and the yellowish hue of my own badge betrays my unenviable membership in the lowest rung of the press hierarchy. Mercifully, I am allowed entrance, and as I take my seat among a sea of critics, I have lost all semblance of composure. Fidgeting in my seat like a schoolboy, I am giddy with excitement. Cannes, here I come.
Read more in Steven’s review of “Café Society”: “The result is a charming and enjoyable, if thoroughly unspectacular, ode to the Golden Age of American cinema—one that teases at a return to form for Allen but ultimately falls just short.”
After the screening, I linger for a while, hoping to gawk at some of the industry’s best as they stride up the red carpet toward the official evening premiere of Woody Allen’s film. Alas, it is not to be—far more prepared media crews have set up long in advance, armed with stepladders and crane-like apparatuses. I manage to take a photo of the back of Justin Timberlake’s head and call it a day.
Read Steven's review of "Money Monster": "'Money Monster' is a largely unambitious film that does little new. What it does do, however, it does reasonably well."
Tianxing V. Lan ’18:
My train from Paris arrives at 7:30 p.m., and I manage to complete my registration two minutes before the press office closes at 8 p.m. Without eating dinner or surveying my apartment, I leave my suitcase in luggage storage and immediately head to the evening screening of Romanian auteur Cristi Puiu’s three-hour-long “Sieranevada.”
Yes, the first in competition film shown in this year’s festival runs three hours long. As if the length is not daunting enough, the slow-paced realist family drama is almost solely composed of stationary long takes. Even for the journalists at Cannes—some of the greatest film connoisseurs in the world—it proves a challenging watch. A number of audience members leave halfway through the screening or keep checking the time on their phones; by the film’s conclusion, the theater is half-full. Those who do stay to the end, though, give the film a warm round of applause.

As the holy temple of cinematic art, Cannes is always open to controversial experiments, pushing the border of what films can portray and the extent to which they can portray it (for reference, see our review of “Love” from last year’s Cannes). So when the audiences at Cannes are shocked by a film’s graphic nature, that’s saying a lot—but French director Alain Guiraudie’s new film, “Rester Vertical (Staying Vertical),” manages to achieve just that. The absurd and haunting dark comedy features explicit sex, a close-up long take of childbirth, and other audacious artistic choices certain to polarize audiences.
It does take some time to realize that “Staying Vertical” is a comedy; at first, the film is just perplexing. The characters do not have clear backgrounds or motivations. They simply meet each other; wallow in awkward silence or talk about nothing of significance; and sometimes have sex. By the film’s conclusion, almost every character has had sex with another, with couplings between both the same and the opposite sex, similar age and those much younger or older. However, not a single sex scene is shown as erotic: They seem almost to be taken out of educational videos, and many times, they confuse the audience with regard to why they happen. This portrayal is in tune with the rest of the film, in which the protagonists’ actions simply occur, leaving little space for empathy or explanation.
Still, as the plot progresses, the audience is provided some background about the characters. The protagonist, Léo (Damien Bonnard), is an untalented screenwriter severely pressured by his agent to finish a script he has been working on for as long as the film is concerned. When he sets out to the countryside, perhaps to find inspiration (the film never specifies), he meets a bored shepherdess (India Hair), with whom he soon strikes up a sexual relationship, and a young man whom he wants to cast for his film but who has no interest in cinema. Throughout “Staying Vertical,” Leo travels in Sisyphean circles to deal with these two people and their aged guardians. Cowardly and sheepish, he is never truly able to persuade anyone to make definitive choices. Instead, he discovers that everyone has a confusing dark side.
To some extent, this film is a biopic of the most impotent coward in the world, a man who has as little control over his life as the audiences watching it. However, while being such a person would be quite miserable, witnessing Léo’s life is unexpectedly fascinating. He is a completely original figure, and every time he inches toward relatability, he takes a surprising direction with his life. It is the same with the others in the film: They are all bizarre, but each in his or her distinctive way, and it is tempting to wonder what will befall them.
The title “Staying Vertical” seems (again, it is never clear) to refer to Léo’s stoic attitude towards the world––that no matter what happens, the best solution is just to stand tall, look tough and pretend to know what is going on. Manifestations of this philosophy make up the film’s most bizarrely funny moments. Although unsettling occurrences take place all the time, everyone is seemingly fine with them; in the rare moments where they have to react to anything together, they look into each other’s eyes with great calmness and do nothing—or have sex. At times, it is questionable whether the characters actually know more than the audience about what they are doing. While this lack of awareness could be a nightmare to many viewers, to the rest, the film is a funny, creative and daring aesthetic experiment that both shocks and entertains.
At a philosophical level, “Staying Vertical” raises the question: Does a film have to be relatable? The film’s inherent, unapologetic weirdness is exactly the charm of it. Guiraudie is surely resolute in following the path of Kafka and Beckett to continue the tradition of the absurd. Regardless of whether a mainstream audience can accept the its style, “Staying Vertical” is definitely a success in its chosen path.

Tianxing V. Lan ’18:
Having slept for less than six hours, I get up at 7 a.m. and rush to the line for the 8:30 a.m. press screening of “Rester Vertical (Staying Vertical).” If I am still half-asleep when I arrive at the Grand Théâtre Lumière, the film immediately wakes me up—and not in a completely pleasant way. The absurdist French comedy features very graphic, matter-of-fact sex scenes, as well as one involving childbirth, earning a reception equal parts applause and confused murmurs as the credits begin to roll.
Read more in Vincent’s review of “Staying Vertical”: “When the audiences at Cannes are shocked by a film’s graphic nature, that’s saying a lot—but French director Alain Guiraudie’s new film, 'Rester Vertical (Staying Vertical),' manages to achieve just that.”
After “Rester Vertical,” I am able to catch up on Woody Allen’s “Café Society.” Most films in Cannes’s official selection have three rounds of screening—an advanced press screening, the official red carpet premiere, and a second-round screening after the premiere––so even though I missed the first two screenings the day before, I am still able to attend the second-round screening today. I find the film very sweet and adorable, one of Allen’s finest since “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.” After “Café Society,” I am finally able to pick up the suitcase I left at the Palais the night before and take a break back at my apartment to enjoy a well-deserved bath. The weather on the French Riviera is warm and lovely, and from the terrace I can see the whole town spreading along the gorgeous coastline.
Of course, there isn’t much time for me to rest. At 4 p.m., I’m back at the Palais again for “I, Daniel Blake.” Directed by English realism master Ken Loach, the film focuses on an unemployed but optimistic working-class hero as he fights against bureaucracy and helps others in need.

Bruno Dumont’s period piece "Ma Loute (Slack Bay)" is a freak of nature, shifting seemingly at will between silly slapstick, twisted black comedy and God knows what else. Fortunately for audiences, the cast and crew have arrived well-prepared for this exercise in chaos. Stylish, hilarious and undeniably absurd, the newest entry in Dumont’s filmography is a fun-filled, laugh-out-loud romp—even when it’s not quite clear what’s happening.
Set during the Belle Époque on a picturesque island in France, “Slack Bay” witnesses the collision of three distinct cohorts of characters, each one odder and more unbelievable than the last. First, there are the Bréforts, a clan of ferrymen whose main source of income involves physically carrying wealthy tourists across a river for a modest payment—a curious notion considering that they own a perfectly functioning rowboat.
On the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum are the Van Peteghems, a hopelessly inbred family of wealthy socialites who are vacationing in their summer villa. The patriarch, André (Fabrice Luchini), is a bumbling hunchback with an inexplicable penchant for gesticulation and verbal repetition. He is joined by a large extended family that includes, notably, his sister and ex-lover, the vain and histrionic Aude (delightfully portrayed by Juliette Binoche).
Finally, we are acquainted with two police officers—a small, red-haired fellow named Malfoy (Cyril Rigaux) and the rotund police chief, Machin (Didier Despres), who can scarcely bend over to investigate something without needing be helped back up. They have come to the island in search for a pair of missing persons who, it turns out, were killed by the Bréforts as part of an occasional and ridiculously nonchalant venture into cannibalism.
It should be patently clear by now that everything about the film is terribly bizarre. Try as the viewer may to make sense of the plot in “Slack Bay,” he will, by design, undoubtedly fail. The film’s charm is not in the details but in its holistic sense of reckless absurdity. Dumont’s characters are purposefully cartoonish in their oddities: They fall flat on their faces for no apparent reason, and towards the end of the film, a few of them simply take to the air and begin to fly. Understandably, enjoying a film like this requires a considerable suspension of disbelief. Those who are able to accept the work for its aimless and whimsical escapism, however, are in for a real treat. Surreal and strange but ultimately a laugh-out-loud affair, “Slack Bay” is a creative revelation.

Tianxing V. Lan ’18:
Films at Cannes are divided into several categories; some even have their own subcategories. The most influential of these is “Official Selection,” which includes “in-competition” films—the films running for the Palme d’Or and other awards given at the end of the festival. While these are usually the most high-profile and high-quality films at Cannes, they make up just a small part of the official selection. “Un Certain Regard (A Certain Regard)” is intended as a stage for rising filmmakers, while “Out of Competition” is for excellent films that do not necessarily meet the festival’s typical taste—for instance, last year’s “Mad Max” was too much a blockbuster for the art-house-oriented Cannes competition but was granted a place in Le Palais thanks to the category. A particular filmmaker often associated with “Out of Competition” is Woody Allen. Despite the public love affair between Allen and France, the director is opposed to the idea of a group of people deciding whether certain films are good or bad; he therefore insists that his films always be shown out of competition, including last year’s “Irrational Man” and this year’s “Café Society.” Partly for this reason, Allen holds the current record of having as many as three opening night films (which are usually out of competition) at Cannes.
For the last two days, Steven and I have been focusing on in-competition films, but starting from now we will also search for gems in other units. Today we watched both the highly anticipated (among French cinephiles, at least) in-competition film “Ma Loute (Slack Bay)” and the Un Certain Regard piece “(M)uchenik (English: The Student),” about which Steven and I knew nothing before walking in. Directed by Bruno Dumont, whose mini-series “P'tit Quinquin” stunned art-house cinema circles, “Slack Bay” features probably the strangest performances from some of the biggest stars in French cinema, including Juliette Binoche and Fabrice Luchini, and had its own press conference immediately after the screening (which I went to, and where I was able to get Binoche's autograph). On the other hand, the director and cast members of “(M)uchenik” are internationally unknown, and the film is more of a traditional drama than the crazy auteur-ish tale that “Slack Bay” is. Both, however, possess great qualities.
Read more in Steven’s review of “Slack Bay”: “Stylish, hilarious and undeniably absurd, the newest entry in Bruno Dumont’s filmography is a fun-filled, laugh-out-loud romp—even when it’s not quite clear what’s happening.”
Read more in Steven’s review of “Uchenik (The Student)”: "In 'Uchenik (The Student),' Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov paints a haunting picture of a student’s violent descent into religious fanaticism and the horrific consequences that follow. To call the film an impeachment of religion or even religious fervor, however, would not be entirely accurate. 'The Student' is not a cautionary tale against piety—it is an admonition of obsession, and a powerful one at that."

As I return to my apartment, I read from Twitter that the other film in “Un Certain Regard” today, “La Danseuse” (in which Lily-Rose Depp made her acting debut), received overwhelming critical acclaim, as did the Peruvian biopic “Neruda” in La Quinzaine des Réalisateurs (Directors’ Fortnight) and Cambodian teen movie “Diamond Island” in Semaine de la Critique (Critics’ Week). These two so-called “parallel units” were first established by groups of directors and film critics (hence the names) to counter the tastes of the official selection and to aim to find good films overlooked by the festival’s juries. With such checks and balances within the festival, it is almost guaranteed that Cannes is able to showcase the best of cinema in any given year. The tradeoff, though, is that sometimes there are just too many good films to see. Alas, tomorrow Steven and I will try to catch up on the good films that we missed today while trying to keep up with all the new ones.

There’s not a whole lot of originality to be found in actress-turned-director Jodie Foster’s “Money Monster.” The Wall Street-themed hostage thriller follows the genre playbook to a tee, reveling in well-trodden conventions and largely familiar plot devices. In light of all of this, the end product is an entertaining and—for the most part—gripping affair. “Money Monster” is a largely unambitious film that does little new. What it does do, however, it does reasonably well.
George Clooney, in a mild departure from his usually dignified (if not always morally scrupulous) roles, plays Lee Gates, a gaudy, high-energy television personality and the host of a show that gives financial advice: the titular “Money Monster.” Gates is, for all intents and purposes, a charlatan. His show, replete with vulgar dance sequences and dangerously sensational language, takes “style over substance” to new extremes.
One day, a dissatisfied viewer (Jack O’Connell) shows up on set. He brandishes a pistol and proceeds to outfit Gates with a suicide vest—one that will detonate as soon as he takes his hand off the dead man’s switch. The man in question, a working-class truck driver named Kyle Budwell, lost everything when he invested in one of Gates’ much-hyped stock picks and is demanding an explanation for why Gates was so wrong. The ensuing action is timely and topical, plunging viewers into a disturbing financial conspiracy and exploring the tenuous line between legality and morality.
O’Connell, best known for his well-received turn in 2014’s “Unbroken,” plays the role of the hostage-taker well. His character isn’t totally compelling, but perhaps that’s the point. Unlike villains of comparable films, Budwell isn’t a criminal mastermind; he’s merely angry and desperate. Clooney is similarly steady in his portrayal of Gates, a man who gradually realizes the folly of his ways and begins to redeem himself accordingly. Last but not least, Julia Roberts lends a commendable performance as Gates’ producer and the prototypical “negotiator” of this particular hostage flick. Her character is hopelessly
static and not particularly insightful, but once again, this flatness is likely intentional—addressing a hostage situation is simply not in her daily job description.
Unfortunately, “Money Monster” falters when it attempts to extend itself further. One particularly ill-advised venture into pathos occurs halfway through the film, when the police locate and patch in Budwell’s pregnant girlfriend, Molly. Furious at her boyfriend for blowing their savings, she unleashes an obscenity-laden tirade on live television, thoroughly humiliating an already distraught Budwell. Unfortunately, what was intended to generate sympathy succeeded only in being comical—a trend that persisted throughout most of the film. Also lacking in finesse was the film’s somewhat pedantic ending, an intensely moralistic climax that valiantly highlighted real problems facing society today but did so in a painfully forced manner.
Thankfully, such brief lapses fail to derail the entire film. Most of the way through, “Money Monster” succeeds in being an effective and well-oiled white-knuckle ride, well worth the audience’s attention and time.

UPDATED: May 15, 2016, at 6:57 p.m.
In his last year as the head of public markets for the Harvard Management Company, Stephen Blyth—now the CEO of Harvard’s investment arm—earned $3 million less than he did the year before, making about $8.3 million in the 2014 calendar year compared to $11.5 million in 2013.
University President Drew G. Faust saw a pay increase—though her compensation was again dwarfed by those of top HMC executives—taking home $1.2 million over the course of the year, roughly $91,000 more than she received in the previous year. The figure includes $810,884 in salary and $153,460 in benefits such as her residence at 33 Elmwood Ave. in Cambridge, according to recent Internal Revenue Service tax filings. Still, the presidents of other peer institutions often make much more than Faust; Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, made $4.6 million in 2013, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education database. Amy Gutmann ’71, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, made more than $3 million that year.
Faust and Blyth’s compensations are among the earnings of several top Harvard officers the University makes public as part of its Form 990 tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service. These are required of all tax-exempt organizations.
In 2014, Blyth was outearned by Andrew G. Wiltshire, who made $10.4 million in 2014 and has since retired as the the head of alternative assets at HMC, and Daniel W. Cummings, who earned $8.7 million in 2014 and is the company’s real estate portfolio manager. Compensation for HMC executives investment  is tied to performance.
Jane L. Mendillo, who resigned as CEO of HMC in 2014, earned $13.8 million in the 18 months leading up to her departure from the investment company.
HMC has consistently returned less on the University’s investments compared to peer institutions in recent years. In fiscal year 2015, Harvard returned 5.8 percent on its endowment investments, while Yale, Princeton, and MIT doubled Harvard, returning 11.5 percent, 12.7 percent, and 13.2 percent on their respective endowments. Blyth has promised to make several changes to HMC’s investment strategies to improve the investment company’s performance, including a new compensation model to tie more of portfolio manager compensation to aspects linked to the company’s overall success.
