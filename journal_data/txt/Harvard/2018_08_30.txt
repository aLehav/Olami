After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bureau of Study Counsel director Abigail Lipson will retire in mid-September, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to students Wednesday.
Lipson’s retirement comes after 13 years in her current role, and a total of 28 years working at the College. Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Sindhumathi Revuluri will serve as the bureau’s interim director this academic year.
During her tenure, Lipson helped oversee the BSC’s move from Harvard University Health Services to the College. In addition to her work leading the BSC, Lipson has served as co-coordinator for the Success-Failure Project — which encourages students to discuss moments of “success, failure, and resilience,” per the BSC website — and BSC liaison to Adams House.
In his email, Khurana wrote he is “deeply grateful” to Lipson for her work as BSC director.
“Abigail has been central to the BSC mission of promoting students’ capacities for meaningful and effective engagement with academic life and learning,” he wrote. “I want to thank Dr. Lipson for all her efforts in supporting you, our students.”
In an email to colleagues yesterday in which she first announced her retirement, Lipson wrote the BSC has been a “home for my heart” and she feels “great gratitude” to her co-workers.
Revuluri’s new role as interim dean at the bureau will not entail a drastic shift from her current work. As associate dean, she oversees the BSC and the Accessible Education Office and works to make academic support services available to all students, Khurana wrote.
In an email Wednesday, Revuluri wrote she is “so grateful” for Lipson’s leadership of the BSC, and for her “partnership” during the transition.
“I’m excited that Rakesh and Amanda have asked me to serve as interim director, and I look forward to getting to work,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ambassador Wendy R. Sherman, the former U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, will lead the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership and become a professor of the practice of public leadership at the school beginning in January, according to a Tuesday press release.
Sherman will continue to serve as a senior fellow in the school’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. As a professor of public leadership, Sherman will head courses and advise students on leadership development.
“Ambassador Sherman has a stellar track record in the public sector and is known for her deep commitment to principled and effective public leadership,” Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said in the press release. “We are very fortunate that she has agreed to lead our Center for Public Leadership at this crucial time in U.S. and global history.”
Sherman will succeed former White House advisor David Gergen as the director for the Center of Public Leadership — a role Gergen has held since the center’s founding in 2000. According to the press release, Gergen will continue to play a role in the center and serve as a professor of public service.
“I also want to extend my profound gratitude to David Gergen for his exceptional leadership as director of the Center for Public Leadership for the past 18 years,” Elmendorf said in the release. “His commitment to the future of public leadership — and to the crucial role that the Kennedy School can, and should, play in creating that future — have transformed the center and the Kennedy School in very important ways.”
While working as an undersecretary in the State Department — a position that made her the fourth-ranking official in the Department — Sherman served as the lead negotiator of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2015. She was awarded the National Security Medal by former President Barack Obama in recognition of her role in the negotiations.
Prior to that position, she worked as the director of EMILY’s List, the director of the state of Maryland’s office of child welfare, and the founding president of the Fannie Mae Foundation, the now-closed charitable wing of the housing finance company.
In her new role, Sherman will be responsible for the Center of Public Leadership’s strategy and collaborations with Kennedy School faculty and students.
“Effective public leadership is essential for ensuring security, freedom, and prosperity for all people,” Sherman said. “The Kennedy School is a preeminent training ground for public leaders from the United States and around the world. I look forward to directing the Center for Public Leadership and to preparing our students to exercise leadership in a world that faces an array of social, political, and economic challenges.”
Sherman’s appointment comes at a time when the Kennedy School has faced criticism from faculty, students, and alumni over the resignation of top female leaders at the school and what some students have called a lack of gender and racial diversity at the faculty and administrative level.
Gergen said in the release that Sherman will find a “community” at the Kennedy School that is “enthusiastic about working with her.”
“From being the first director of Child Welfare for the State of Maryland to leading the U.S. team in negotiating the nuclear agreement with Iran, Wendy has been a highly distinguished, wide-ranging, and passionate public leader,” Gergen said. “Her appointment will help lift the Center for Public Leadership to a new level of impact by supporting our faculty and preparing a new generation of leaders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article has been updated.
The United States Department of Justice said in a court filing Thursday morning that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies perpetrate “unlawful racial discrimination” against Asian American applicants.
“The record evidence demonstrates that Harvard’s race-based admissions process significantly disadvantages Asian-American applicants compared to applicants of other racial groups — including both white applicants and applicants from other racial minority groups,” department officials wrote.
The Justice Department’s criticism came as part of a “statement of interest” it filed in the ongoing admissions lawsuit that alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Its filing is meant to oppose the University’s earlier motion that the suit be dismissed before it goes to trial.
Harvard spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that the University resents the department’s interference. She added that Harvard continues to deny all charges of discrimination.
“We are deeply disappointed that the Department of Justice has taken the side of Edward Blum and Students for Fair Admissions, recycling the same misleading and hollow arguments that prove nothing more than the emptiness of the case against Harvard,” Cowenhoven wrote.
Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions first brought suit against Harvard four years ago. Helmed by conservative litigant Edward Blum, the group argues Harvard is trying to "racially engineer" its student body. SFFA's ultimate goal is to end the use of race in college admissions, a mission experts say the lawsuit may accomplish if it reaches the Supreme Court.
The suit has already had some consequences. Over the course of summer 2018, hundreds of pages of internal College documents related to the admissions process became public as part of the summary judgment phase of the lawsuit.
Department lawyers specifically pointed to various revelations that proceeded from the documents’ release — including the discovery that College admissions officers consistently gave Asian-American applicants lower scores for their personal traits — as proof that Harvard’s admissions policies are discriminatory.
“The evidence… shows that Harvard provides no meaningful criteria to cabin its use of race; uses a vague ‘personal rating’ that harms Asian-American applicant’s chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias; engages in unlawful racial balancing; and has never seriously considered race-neutral alternatives in its more than 45 years of using race to make admissions decisions,” department lawyers wrote.
The lawyers cited Harvard’s receipt of federal funding as justification for the Justice Department’s involvement in the suit. Referencing an earlier Supreme Court opinion, attorneys argued the department must work to ensure that tax dollars “do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press release announcing the filing that the department is intervening in the case to defend the civil rights of the American people.
"No American should be denied admission to school because of their race," Sessions said. "As a recipient of taxpayer dollars, Harvard has a responsibility to conduct its admissions policy without racial discrimination by using meaningful admissions criteria that meet lawful requirements."
The memo, signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General John M. Gore, heavily cites the testimony of Harvard admissions officers— including Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 — as well as internal University research which the Justice Department says reveals how the school's admissions process “harms” Asian-American applicants.
Harvard’s research office concluded in a series of reports circulated among top administrators in 2013 that the College’s admissions policies produce “negative effects” for Asian Americans. But the reports were never made public — until the lawsuit required their release — and did not spur College officials to take significant action to address the situation.
In their filing, Department lawyers specifically took Harvard to task for failing to act on that report.
“Harvard admits that, on average, it scores Asian-American applicants lower on the personal rating than white applicants,” lawyers wrote. “Yet when an internal Harvard report pointed out that the personal rating may be infused with racial bias and sought authorization to study the issue further, Harvard buried it.”
This is not the first time the Justice Department has intervened in the suit. The department requested the unsealing of previously confidential Harvard admissions documents and data in April.
It is also independently conducting a Title VI investigation into Harvard in response to the allegations that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Lawyers for the department wrote in Thursday's filing that that probe is active and ongoing.
The Trump administration is tackling affirmative action in other quarters, too. In early July, the Justice Department and the Department of Education penned a "Dear Colleague" letter notifying universities that the government was withdrawing Obama-era recommendations that encouraged race-conscious admissions.
At the time, a University spokesperson said that Harvard plans to ignore the retraction of the old guidance and "will continue to vigorously defend its right, and that of all colleges and universities" to consider race as a factor in the admissions process.
Blum wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that SFFA is pleased with recent events.
“Students for Fair Admissions is gratified that, after careful analysis of the evidence submitted in this case, the US Department of Justice has concluded Harvard’s admissions policies are in violation of our nation’s civil rights laws,” Blum wrote.
Harvard student groups and legal organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union also filed amicus briefs Thursday, though theirs argued in support of Harvard and its admissions policies.
The case is set to go to trial in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15.
