After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not every day that a popular sitcom references John Rawls and Ariana Grande in the same episode. Yet “The Good Place” regularly alternates between registers academic and pop cultural. Created by Michael H. Schur ’97 and starring Kristen Bell, William Jackson Harper, and Ted Danson, the show will air its fourth and final season premiere on Sept. 26 on NBC. 
Looking ahead to the upcoming premiere, Schur and Harper stopped by WBUR CitySpace in Boston for a discussion of the show’s philosophy moderated by Colby College philosophy professor, Lydia Moland. Backstage at CitySpace before the Sept. 17 event, The Harvard Crimson sat down with Schur and Harper for a conversation on representation, dense philosophical rants, and controversial comedy. 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
The Harvard Crimson: Michael, many of the shows you’ve created seem to take the form of ensemble comedies, or are set in workplace conditions. What is particularly interesting to you about that environment?
Michael H. Schur: About a workplace setting? I mean, a couple things. My first job was on "The Office," and that was kind of the ultimate workplace show. And that's how I learned to write.… There's something very American about setting a show in an office because it's a place that feels universal. Everybody has to go to one, or most people do, at some level. And also, I'm a white man from suburban Connecticut, and I have a white wife and two white children, and there's nothing interesting to say about my family life at all. There just isn't. There have been so many TV shows about every version of my family… So a workplace, like a police precinct, or a local government office, or essentially, what amounts to the afterlife, means anyone can be there. You can get people from everywhere. They can look however you want them to look, and the possibilities are greater for me personally, because there's nothing interesting about my life.
THC: It’s interesting that you bring up diversity, because it’s such a pertinent question in comedy at the moment. “The Good Place” is an exemplar for diversity, from race to sexuality. Has that been at the foundation of the show since its inception? Has it taken on a new light recently?
MHS: That idea of that being important has been around in my life for a lot longer than this show, but there were a couple of important things to me about the beginning of the show. Because we were saying, “This is just a sample of good people on earth, people who won the ‘good job award’ for being good,” we had a bunch of rules in the beginning. In the casting of the main characters, I was like, there's gonna be one person from North America, one person from South Asia, one person from East Asia, one person from Africa. That was a rule now. There was a little bit of a trick because the Buddhist monk from Tibet turned out to be a Filipino dirtbag from Jacksonville. But still the main premise held. But then also in the background, the people milling around… We broke down very roughly the demographics of the world. 40 percent of the people you see walking around in fact are actually East Asian, or Asian, including South Asian. Because if you lumped all of the people on earth into a room and picked them at random, that's what you would get, right? So we did stuff like that, because it was important to me, that it not seem like anyone had an advantage. It's like a "Moneyball" universe where anyone can achieve. It's just about your actions and not about what your starting block level was, right? So we did that.
In the pilot, Eleanor says, "Who was right about all this?" And Michael says, "The Jews were five percent right, the Muslims are five percent right, the Christians, right, everyone's like, five percent right. Right?" So we were trying to signal like that. This is a system that's mathematical, that has nothing to do with people's beliefs or anything on Earth, except for your actions, because anything else starts to get religious or cultural. And I really wanted this to be purely ethical… You couldn't do this show if you had four people from, you know, suburban Massachusetts.
THC: Will, what extent of creative freedom did Michael give you with the character of Chidi?
William Jackson Harper: [jokingly] None. You know, I feel like we're all allowed in the show to get pretty weird and make really odd choices… You never really felt straitjacketed. But I think just because the narrative is so specific and so tight — you know, I think that myself, as well as the other actors on the show — we really wanted to get it right. We really wanted to just see if we can, you know, fulfill our mission. But you know, also, it's just that there's not a lot of room to just sort of, go for it. Because there's things that are very tightly plotted that we have to do, we have to make sure play later, and … our job is to be in that world as fully as we can, rather than just like...
MHS: Freelance.
WJH: Yeah, freelance. Just making up stuff.
MHS: It would've been funny to see you guys try to improvise.
WJH: There's no way. You know what I mean? Like, I have no idea what I'm talking about most of the time. So if I start improvising, you'll know very quickly.
MHS: Just do a tight, 10-minute Hume.
THC: Right, there are so many philosophical rants on the show. How did you prepare for those rants?
WJH: Actually, you know, it's weird, I usually would take the language and just [organize] it by ideas. There's the way that it's printed out in a screenplay format, and I would just basically take the ideas … I'm trying to get across, and put those on a line by itself.
MHS: Did you actually retype it? I didn't know that.
WJH: Especially when I had something particularly dense, I would have to do that just so I could map out the ideas more clearly, individually for me for myself, so I could actually play with them and play the scene a little bit more effectively, rather than just trying to get it out, you know, by rote.
MHS: I know people who have hand-written their lines out. Yeah, there's something about having a tactile connection to actually writing the language.
WJH: Yeah. I know a lot of actors that do that, actually. But for me, I needed to get the ideas put together. And that helped me pretend to have some kind of grasp what I'm saying.
MHS: It's cool, man.
THC: Do you think that being so immersed in this dense philosophical material has had any effect on your personal life? Do either of you think it has made you become more civically engaged?
MHS: People really want to know that. We get asked that a lot.
WJH: [jokingly] Yeah, um, I'm still trash. But I do. It’s funny that you say civically engaged, because I think that I'm actually a little bit more engaged civically and politically than I have been before.
MHS: Really?
WJH: Yeah. You know, there's a platform that this show has provided me, but on top of that, the ideas do sort of work their way in a little bit. Especially the climate we live in now, it seems like there's a sort of iteration of an antihero type… I find it irksome, and I feel like I need to resist that in some way. And so I found myself in positions where I'm going to protests and, you know, making calls and doing that sort of thing that I never did before.
MHS: I wonder if you hadn't been on the show, if the culture would have done that to you, by itself.
WJH: Maybe, but you know, I think the show does put a lot of those ideas front of mind now.
THC: “The Good Place” occupies such an interesting place in the pop culture landscape right now because it interrogates how to be an ethical person. Political correctness is an important conversation that's happening in comedy at the moment. For instance, Shane Gillis recently got fired from “Saturday Night Live” for his remarks about Chinese people. Last spring, the Lampoon was censured for publishing a sexualized image of Anne Frank. What is your approach when it comes to writing about or performing potentially sensitive matters? Is that something that you think about a lot when you're writing?
MHS: The people that I make TV shows with and I have a policy that has been reduced to the simple idea: No assholes. That's the idea. Don’t hire assholes. It’s remarkably effective.… And as a result of that policy, it's a pretty fun place to work, right? It's pretty loose and pretty nice. Everyone treats each other with kindness and respect and dignity, at a level that we shouldn't be patting ourselves on the back for treating people with respect and graciousness and dignity. That should be a baseline of how humans interact with each other… There's the backlash from, you know, the “cancel culture,” “the mob is coming for you.” It's like, you're being an asshole. Look... If you're the only guy in the world, who can fly a spaceship and land it on the asteroid and drill a hole in the asteroid and put a nuclear bomb and blow it up to save Earth, you can say whatever you want about Asian people, because we don't have a choice, right? But if you're one of three new people who's joining a 46-year-old sketch show, and you do that, then you're an asshole, and go away. We don't need you.
There's this weird mentality when people do stupid things that are offensive, and then what happens is first, they say, “Well, that's what comedy is, and comedy needs to be combative, and it needs to push boundaries.” It's like, all right, settle down. You made a joke. That dude made a joke that was old and tired and offensive 50 years ago. The idea that that’s somehow cool and edgy and groundbreaking — that's the same shit that people have been doing for decades and decades and decades. And so, that argument doesn't work.
And then the other argument is, "Well, can you say anything? You can't say anything nowadays!" No, you can. You can say whatever you want, as long as you don't treat people horribly disrespectfully, in a way that's reductive and stupid and asshole-ish. I'm just so sick of the backlash. He did the bad thing. And then people are like, “Yeah, that's bad.” And then he gets offended, and other people defend him and get offended. Don't defend that guy. Defend good people. There's a lot of good people who don't do shit like that. I'm cursing a lot, but I just don't understand it... The idea that there's some purity in being able to say whatever you want or that you're stifling creativity — no, you're not. That's not creative. That thing that he said is so boring. It's so boring. Everything he did is so boring. It's been boring and offensive and old for hundreds of years, so forgive me if I don't think that you're a revolutionary Lenny Bruce genius for saying the same shit that people have been saying forever.
THC: [to Harper] Anything to add?
WJH: Not really. I think to piggyback on what you're saying, it's like, A) it's lazy. B), It's never funny. It's never funny. It's one of those things where, as a black dude, someone will make a joke that throws black people under the bus, and then I don't laugh at it. It's like, “Oh, you're offended.” No, I'm not. I'm actually not offended. The joke was bad. I'm a little bored and disappointed. That's annoying. You know, it's because I guess for me, a lot of those things are less hurtful and more just like — it's more like a mosquito that keeps buzzing by your ear. Like, "Oh, stop it." Stop.
MHS: Let someone who's had a new thought in the last 180 years walk in and join the conversation.
WJH: You completely lose the element of surprise when you go to that sort of boiler-plate, offensive stuff. You know, it's because it's not surprising. These are the things that everyone's, you know, racist grandparents have said a million times over. It’s boring.

Recently, the 27th annual Cambridge Carnival, which celebrates Afro-Caribbean culture and identity, was called off after a string of gun violence near the Boston Caribbean Carnival Parade in August, and after Cambridge Police Department received intelligence that the festival was under possible threat of gun violence. This news also comes five years after a deadly shooting at a 2014 Caribbean festival in Dorchester where an innocent bystander was shot and killed.
The Cambridge Carnival offers a lively celebration of the culture and traditions of Cambridge’s Afro-Caribbean community. It is both an important event for that community and its sense of identity, as well as an important way for it to represent itself to the greater Boston area. We are saddened to see such a lively cultural celebration shut down due to recent acts of gun-related violence in the Boston area.
We recognize the necessity of canceling the event for the sake of the safety of festival goers. Certainly, violence should be avoided at all costs. But we grow ever more conscious of the degree to which gun violence not only threatens the physical safety of our communities, but also their proud expression of identity.
Time and time again, cities and towns across the country have felt the need to succumb to the fear of gun violence. With the rise of gun violence in neighborhoods and school districts across our country, it’s become commonplace to fear such heinous acts which only keep citizens from expressing their cultures, traditions, and heritage. We urge members of the greater Boston area to stand up against the culture of gun violence in their own neighborhoods and to stand up for their respective cultures and identities.
While the carnival could not be held on its originally scheduled date, we hope that festival organizers and CPD officials work together to ensure that the celebration will eventually take place this year, in an environment where Afro-Caribbean Cambridge residents can feel safe to express their identity. Going forward, we hope that citizens of Cambridge’s many diverse neighborhoods do not have to give in to a fear of gun violence, and change plans and traditions due to threats of weapons and conflicts.
We also caution government leaders not to give in to fear tactics that may be created in the spirit of hate and cultural repression. Our city cannot shut down in the face of threats; it has to find ways of protecting itself and its traditions. How tragic would it have been if the Boston Marathon had never been raced again? How tragic would it be if the Afro-Caribbean Carnival ceased to exist?
We remain outraged by the gun violence that has become a defining feature of American society. It is not just acts of terror that silence voices. It is often the violence seeping out of our own nation that stifles celebrations of American identity in all its many shapes and forms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few years ago, my life was changed forever when my youngest brother took his life. I know I am not the only one in our community who has lost a loved one to suicide.
There are others — too many others — in the Harvard community who have lost a child, a parent, a sibling, or a friend to suicide. The outpouring of support for my family after my brother died was immediate and impactful. But after a loss, time passes, families and communities move forward, and we stop talking about suicide.
We need to keep talking. Those who are suffering from depression and other mental illnesses need our support every day, not just when they are in crisis. We need to be comfortable listening when someone is expressing ideas that their life is not worth living. We need to let them know that they matter and then try to get them the help they need.
I am grateful to the many people on this campus who work tirelessly to offer this support. We are fortunate to have so many dedicated student leaders at the College — from the many peer counseling groups to the Student Mental Health Liaisons to all peer advisors focused on wellness working to promote a healthy, supportive student community. I stand in awe of our College and University faculty and staff, including the faculty deans, resident deans, proctors and tutors, and our Counseling and Mental Health Services therapists for all that they do to connect our students to vital resources, to provide treatment, and to offer educational or prevention-based support across the University.
And yet, we still need to do more. We need to keep working until every member of this community is able to take advantage of the information and resources available to them. There isn’t a day that goes by when I don’t think about my youngest brother. But we shouldn’t have to experience enormous loss to recognize that we are all in each other’s worlds, and that we need to take care of each other.
September is National Suicide Prevention Month, which prompted me to share my own experience. But we should be having this conversation all the time. We need to work together to normalize the conversations about mental health, to use the word “suicide” and not be afraid. I am no longer afraid to talk about this. Let’s start talking right now.
Please, if you are having thoughts of suicide, counselors are available at Harvard University Health Services and can be reached at 617-495-5711 or online. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.

“Wait, you’re from American Samoa? Like as in the island in the Pacific?  Wow, that’s really exotic, but guess it makes sense… you look like an exotic island girl.”
It was during my first year here at Harvard that I first heard someone use the word “exotic” to describe me. Now, I’ll be honest. The first time one of my classmates said this to me, I was extremely flattered. In fact, I was more than flattered. As a lost, struggling freshman thousands of miles away from home, I clung to the thought of someone thinking that I was beautiful, unique, and intriguing — because initially this was what I equated the word “exotic” with. I would come to realize, however, that the word “exotic” meant something quite different.
Being “exotic” can mean a lot more than just being  “stunning” or “beautiful.” In fact, the word is used to signify that you are, not just different, but deviant. The more and more I heard people at Harvard use it to refer to me, I realized that the reason they called me exotic was not so much because they thought I was beautiful. It was because I did not quite fit the white standard of beauty. My hair was a feisty, brown frizz-fest that ran down to my waist — not a silky straight blond strand in sight. As I stood nearly six feet tall with size eleven feet, I was constantly reminded that I was too tall or that I had outrageously large feet for a woman. And as my curves bulged out from under my tight clothes (since a lot of clothes are not really made for women like me), I knew that I was called “exotic” because my body was being oversexualized due to its divergence from the standard white petite feminine body.
And this idea of exotification has haunted Pasefika women for centuries. In her book “The Pacific Muse: Exotic Femininity and the Colonial Pacific,” Patty O’Brien talks about the history of the fetishization of island women. Her research examines the accounts of explorers, missionaries, whalers, etc. from as far back as the late 1700s and reveals their oversexualization of Pasefika women. White men created and enforced this stereotype of exotic femininity onto Pacific island women — one that represented, and continues to represent us, as the “little brown gal,” “ hula girl,” and one who is “unself-consciously naked, physically perfect, passive, and pleasing.”
This representation continues to haunt us today. Just watch any vacation advertisement trying to entice tourists to the Pacific islands, and you’ll see what I’m talking about. They’ve probably thrown in a Pasefika woman somewhere — whether it be a Hawaiian hula girl or Tahitian dancer — in the background, dancing and trying to please white tourists, as they shake their bodies in small sarongs and coconut bras. And though historically a lot of Pasefika women were not fully covered and the act of shaking your hips is an integral part of a lot of traditional Pacific dances, it becomes a problem when our bodies, our cultural wear, and traditional dances are only ever displayed in the context of entertaining and bringing pleasure to outside onlookers. When we are only ever presented as objects of pleasure, our bodies are rendered as commodities and our minds as primitive.
This presentation of Pasefika women isn’t just something that offends us. It’s something that very much negatively impacts the way we are perceived and can literally put is in physical danger. In fact, the UN reported in 2011 that 60 to 80 percent of women and girls across the Pacific Islands will experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetimes. There are obviously a lot of social and cultural factors playing into the physical and/or sexual violence that Pasefika women endure. But if we are constantly represented as oversexualized, “exotic” objects that need to be conquered, little by little our humanity is stripped away and our abuse then becomes even more justified.
And the effects of exotification extends beyond just Pasefika women. It affects all women of color. Indigenous women are portrayed as primitive or “savage.” Asian women are likened to delicate flowers and are presented as fragile and submissive. Black women have historically been depicted as animalistic.  And Latinx women are often referred to as “spicy”.  This exotification not only negatively and wrongly represents all women of color, but perpetuates a white standard of beauty and fails to recognize that beauty takes the form of different hair textures, heights, shapes, and sizes.
With these uninformed stereotypes circulating the media and the public sphere, it comes as no surprise to me as to why, every time I wear a flower in my hair or hang a shell necklace around my neck or wrap a lavalava —  no, not a skirt — tightly around my waist, I am labeled the “exotic” island girl. But I don’t want to be the exotic island girl. I don’t want my culture appropriated and my body oversexualized for not fitting a widely — but very wrongly — accepted ideal of beauty. But most importantly, I don’t want to be afraid that my status as “exotic island girl” increases my chances of physical and/or sexual violence.
So, please, stop calling us exotic. Because in doing so, you are literally putting us in danger.

A number of gates on Harvard’s campus that mark the entrance to University-owned space mysteriously bear the insignias of various Harvard final clubs. But since 1984, when nine all-male clubs officially severed ties with the university, all such social organizations have remained formally disaffiliated from the school. So what’s the deal with the logos? In an exclusive interview with [redacted] Fate bearing [redacted] final club logo, FM investigates. 
FM: Hey, [redacted] Gate bearing [redacted] final club logo. Thanks for agreeing to this interview.
Gate: ...
FM: Okay, cool. So, I guess, like, the first thing I wanted to ask was like, why, um, sorry, let me pull up my notes, why, like—
Gate makes judgmental gated reaction about FM’s use of “like” and “um”
FM: Sorry, I’m just a little nervous to be interviewing you, if I’m being honest. Just like, you’re kind of a big deal, [Redacted] Gate.
Gate is flattered.
FM: Right so anyway. Let’s just dive in, I guess. Why is there a [redacted name of final club] logo branded into your… I’m sorry, I’m not super familiar with Gate anatomy… I guess it’s your external shell?
Gate: ...
FM: Skin?
Gate is weirded out; Gate definitely does not possess skin, and resents being anthropomorphized.
FM: Okay sorry just like, I didn’t know—
Gate recuses gateself from this interview.
FM: Wait, no! Come back!
Gate is confused by this command, seeing as Gate never left, as Gate is a Gate and cannot physically move.
FM: What I mean is, can you please un-recuse yourself from this interview?
Gate: …
FM: Come on, [redacted] Gate. Help me out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched an online platform this semester to give faculty and staff tailor-made web pages with articles, events, and other information from University sources based on their academic interests.
The platform, called “Harvard Link,” bills itself as a tool that “empowers” faculty and staff to “make new and smarter connections with other colleagues, organizations, events, news, and courses across Harvard,” per an online project overview.
Developed by the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning, the site uses faculty and staff’s professional websites to fill their dashboards with personalized information from existing Harvard web pages and databases, according to Zachary Wang, who works at the office and helped create the platform. Staff and faculty can also enter keywords to customize their pages.
“While there have been other things in the past that sort of aggregate information or that are directory services — which we built upon — nothing has really gone that next step to personalization, and nothing has aggregated as many different data sources as Link has done,” Wang said.
Government professor Dustin Tingley, who serves as deputy vice provost for advances in learning, said the idea for Harvard Link stemmed from the Harvard Syllabus Explorer, a search engine launched last fall by his office that allows students to search syllabi of current and previous courses.
“Other ideas started to layer on top of it, like, ‘Well, if we collected… faculty’s professional public websites, we could then recommend different people to each other, not just a syllabus to someone,” Tingley said.
One of the platform’s main features is a “nearest neighbor” tool designed to help professors better understand the interests of students enrolled in their classes, Tingley said. The tool provides faculty with information about their students’ past and current course enrollments to facilitate coordination among professors who share the same students.
Tingley said his office plans to add a feature to the platform that recommends research funding opportunities to faculty.
“We are working with a vendor that basically collects a database of research funding opportunities, and then we're going to then be able to pipe in sort of recommendations that draw from that database,” he said. “That's going to be something that's really exciting.”
Multiple professors said they would consider using the new dashboard, but had to learn more before making a full judgement about its usefulness.
“It looks pretty interesting, even interesting enough that I will probably go back to it,” Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall wrote in an email.
Tingley said his office is currently consulting undergraduates to potentially expand the tool to students in the future. He added that he hopes to formally coordinate with the College.

Spyce, a Boston-based restaurant chain offering meals engineered by robot chefs, will debut in Harvard Square in early 2020.
The new Cambridge location is set to open in One Brattle Square in the space previously occupied by fast-casual Mexican chain Chipotle, which closed in January.
At Spyce, robot chefs prepare a variety of grain bowls and salads. The dishes are then examined by a “garde manager” — or a “garnish employee” — who adds final ingredients and checks the dish for its presentation, according to its website.
Spyce was founded by four MIT graduates, who built their first prototype robot in the basement of their fraternity and branded themselves as the “Spyce Boys,” according to its website. The group opened their first location in Boston in May 2018 after teaming up with Michelin star chef Daniel Boulud.
Kale T. Rogers, the chief operating officer and co-founder of Spyce, said when the group devised the concept for the restaurant, they were motivated by a mission to provide more people with access to healthy, affordable food.
“There’s a lot of ways in which a restaurant can affect people,” Rogers said. “That’s really allowed us to land on this mission of enabling people to live fuller healthier lives.”
With its robotic kitchen, Spyce employs fewer human employees, enabling the restaurant to make their food more affordable, according to its website. Rogers said Spyce aims to provide healthy food in an “accessible, easier, customizable” way to its patrons.
“There’s an onus on the new styles of restaurants to really make sure that you’re taking people’s best interests in mind through health and the food that they’re eating, but also the way that you treat the team members that you have at the restaurants, the way that you treat guests, customers as they come in, and even your suppliers,” Rogers said.
Prior to opening, Spyce is still awaiting approval from the Cambridge Licensing Commission to serve alcohol and remain open until 2 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday and until 4 a.m. Thursday through Saturday. Though they were supposed to come before the commission Tuesday, Roger said their hearing was rescheduled for Oct. 23 due to a scheduling conflict.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, called Spyce a “fun” addition to the neighborhood.
“I love the idea that they’re going to be open late,” Jillson said.
Rogers — a Cambridge resident — said he is looking forward to opening a location in Harvard Square.
“As someone who went to school just up the road, I’ve always loved Cambridge,” he said.
Georgia K. Steigerwald ’23 said that she was interested in the concept of the restaurant.
“It’s very Harvard, I guess, bringing technology to other aspects of life,” Steigerwald said. “It seems like it would have good food, so I would definitely be willing to try it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 20 members of Divest Harvard and climate group 350 Massachusetts convened in Harvard Yard Tuesday to criticize University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Mass. Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 for a “lack of urgency” on climate change issues.
The groups held a 30 minute-long mock press conference featuring puppets depicting Bacow and Baker; members of both groups acted as assistants to criticize what they say has been the leaders’ inaction on climate change issues, including Harvard’s financial ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Craig S. Altemose, executive director of Better Future Project — a Cambridge-based climate group that oversees the 350 Massachusetts group, stood as Baker’s “assistant” as members of Divest Harvard and 350 Massachusetts asked questions like “Why won’t you guys divest?” and “How many more cases are you prepared to lose?” referring to court cases filed against the Massachusetts government regarding environmental issues.
The event Tuesday is part of a tour 350 Massachusetts is taking around the state — dubbed “Charlie's Climate Catastrophe Tour” — to criticize the governor for being a “climate failure” in the wake of the Sept. 20 climate strike.
“When he came into office, he largely has continued many of the policies that the [Deval] Patrick administration set in motion, but hasn't really called for any deepening of ambition in any really big way,” Altemose said.
Spokespeople for Baker did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday evening.
Despite criticisms, Baker has not been silent on climate change issues, calling for a tax hike on real estate sales to raise money to combat climate change in June. The Republican governor testified before a Congressional committee in February, calling on the federal government to take significant action in response to climate change.
Divest Harvard member Ilana A. Cohen ’22 spoke on behalf of the group — which advocates for the University to divest its endowment holdings in the fossil fuel industry — along with Altemose.
“We've been demanding that Harvard University disclose, divest and reinvest its fossil fuel holdings by Earth Day 2020 for a while,” Cohen said.
“But this is a promising sign seeing these figures, our very own governor and University president out here,” she added, referring to the puppets.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to previous statements regarding Harvard’s position on divestment. Most recently, Bacow published an article in Harvard Magazine articulating his view on climate change and how to combat it.
“We may differ on means. But I believe we seek the same ends—a decarbonized future in which life on Earth can flourish for ages to come,” Bacow wrote.
On coming together for Tuesday’s event, Altemose said his group has been a “longtime supporter” of the Divest Harvard movement and saw an opportunity to collaborate.
“I think we just noticed some parallels between both Governor Baker and President Bacow not really living up to the leadership that's demanded of them in this moment,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has signed onto the Cool Food Pledge, an initiative aimed at slashing food-related greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent by 2030, the University announced Tuesday.
The initiative follows a commitment from the University to become fossil fuel neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel free by 2050, a goal set by former University President Drew G. Faust in 2018.
Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said in a press release that the pledge was a method of creating a “more sustainable food system” for the school.
“Addressing the emissions associated with our food choices is a focal part of Harvard’s holistic approach to using our campus as a testbed to address climate change and sustainability,” Lapp said. “This pledge gives us a common science-based collective target and a way of learning together with institutions around the world as we strive to create a more sustainable food system.”
The Cool Food Pledge helps dining facilities at places like hotels, restaurants, and hospitals minimize emissions and develop dining plans that reduce their carbon footprints. Other signatories include Boston Medical Center, Morgan Stanley, and the University of Maryland.
Walter C. Willet, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-chair of Harvard’s Food Standards Committee, said in the release that Americans are some of the greatest contributors to climate change due to their diets.
“Among the many changes we need to make, including a rapid shift to green energy, is a change in diet to a more plant-based way of eating,” Willet said. “The actions of every individual are important, but because Harvard intends to be a leadership institution and educates people who will be leaders, steps such as the Cool Food Pledge can be particularly impactful.”
Since taking office, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has stressed that the University should contribute its scholarship to combatting the effects of climate change. Last week, the Harvard Management Company signed onto Climate Action 100+, a group of investors working to push greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change initiatives.
For years, the school has fielded calls to divest its investments in the fossil fuel industry and faced sharp criticism from activists. On Friday, students, faculty, and staff participated in the Global Climate Strike and urged University leaders to withdraw its holdings from fossil fuel companies.
Bacow has repeatedly refused to divest, maintaining that the endowment should not be used as a mechanism for social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fourteen members of the class of 2020 were named as Senior Class Marshals Tuesday following two rounds of elections.
The Marshals collectively make up the Senior Class Committee — a student group responsible for organizing class-wide events leading up to Commencement in May. The committee also plans post-graduation reunion events and leads the fundraising effort for the Senior Gift.
The class of 2020 elected Eric J. Cheng ’20 and Angelina Ye ’20 as the First and Second Marshals, respectively.
Cheng said his primary focus in his new role will be planning inclusive events for his class in addition to traditional senior events such as Senior Soirée.
“In the process I really want to emphasize our sense of community before we all head out into our separate paths,” Cheng said. “We want more intimate conversations and reflective experiences that go beyond what we see everywhere, where people can sit down and look back at their last four or four plus years and think about what their Harvard experience means.”
Ye said she is “really excited” for her new role and to work with this year’s class committee.
“The people on class committee this year are awesome in that we all have so much energy — that’s going to be so valuable,” she said. “This year’s class committee is really diverse. I think that’s something that will play to our advantage a lot.”
Kyle A. Sanok ’20, one of the six elected Program Marshals, said he will prioritize the execution of the traditional senior class events in his role. The Program Marshals are those who place third through eighth in the election process.
“I want to execute [the old events] really well, because I know that people get excited about the boat cruise, about Last Chance Dance,” Sanok said.
In addition to the eight marshals, six seniors were appointed Gift Marshals by the Harvard College Fund after an application and interview process.
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 — one of the elected gift marshals — said she would like to dedicate the senior class donations to bolstering financial aid, mental health resources, and undergraduate house life.
“There are a lot of things that happen in the day-to-day life here that are easy to take for granted, and we can encourage people to take a step back and see how important all those aspects are to our day-to-day here,” Palaniappan said.
The full list of seniors selected for the Senior Class Committee is below:
First Marshal
Eric J. Cheng ’20 (Quincy)
Second Marshal
Angelina Ye ’20 (Lowell)
Program Marshals
Urshella N. Hishaam ’20 (Leverett)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three 2020 campaign reporters shared stories from the presidential primary campaign trail at an Institute of Politics event on Tuesday, the first in a series of events in the lead-up to the 2020 election.
The discussion, moderated by IOP Senior Fellow and Washington Post Chief Correspondent Daniel “Dan” J. Balz, featured reporters Chelsea Janes from the Washington Post, Musadiq Bidar from CBS News, and Marianna Sotomayor from NBC News.
The conversation took place just hours after Speaker Nancy P. Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced that the United States House of Representative would launch a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. As moderator, Balz acknowledged changes in campaign coverage that might occur in the wake of the current whistle-blower debate.
“We don’t know where [the inquiry] is going to end, we don’t know quite about what will play out, but I think what what we do know is that, for everybody on the campaign trail, it’s going to change their lives somewhat — if not the very field,” Balz said. “It will become the central issue in the presidential campaign.”
Sotomayor, who covers presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden, talked about how his campaign is reacting to Trump’s accusations of his corrupt dealings with Ukraine.
“This is definitely totally different territory for him, something he is going to have to get a bit adjusted to, because this is going to be the new reality,” Sotomayor said. “We are going to be asking him about this all the time.”
Biden’s campaign is going into “overdrive” trying to get out his version of the story and counter Trump’s tweets, according to Sotomayor.
In addition to developments in Biden’s candidacy, the reporters also discussed the status of other Democratic frontrunners like Senator Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Senator Elizabeth A. Warren (D-Mass.).
Janes, who has spent time covering Harris, said that the senator’s initial momentum in the polls is dwindling.
“She was sort of seemingly on paper built for the moment,” Janes said. “A woman of color at a time when, you know, there is so much clamoring for some of these inequities of gender and race to be fixed.”
But according to Janes, Harris has been “lost in the shuffle” because her platform is somewhat nebulous – especially compared to what she characterized as Warren’s clear messaging.
“It just seems like she’s tried to thread this middle needle,” Janes said. “Especially when you have people like Sanders and Warren — whose positions are just so clear, and, you know, their stated purpose is so well known — any time you start shifting, fairly or not, you look noncommittal.”
Bidar, who has covered the campaign trail in Iowa, attributed Warren’s success so far in part to a robust team of organizers and volunteers.
“When I moved to Iowa in June, one of the first things that we kept hearing from everybody we talked to is the incredible ground game she’s built there,” Bidar said. “Every time we talk to voters, her name comes up a lot.”
After the event, Balz commented on the unique challenges faced by the embedded reporters in this election cycle.
“Numerous readers are much more critical of what we do,” Balz said. “So, I think it is harder right now to do the job the way we’ve always been used to doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some international students at Harvard report confronting additional hurdles in visa processing under Trump administration policies, complicating their efforts to get to campus, study abroad, and work over the summer.
 Students navigating complicated visa application processes say they now face longer processing periods — delays which can affect their ability to arrive on campus each semester. They must often start necessary paperwork months in advance. Some create backup plans in case they are unable to get to campus in time for classes.
Visa processing delays, denials, and cancellations have become more common under Trump administration immigration policy for citizens of certain countries. Ismail B. Ajjawi ’23, a Palestinian resident of Lebanon, recently made national headlines when he was detained at Boston Logan International Airport and turned away from the United States.
A border official allegedly subjected Ajjawi to hours of questioning about his religion upon his arrival at Boston Logan on Aug. 27. Ajjawi told The Crimson the official searched his phone and laptop and then informed him that she had found anti-American political posts by his Facebook friends. She then told him that his visa would be cancelled and that he would have to return to Lebanon.
Harvard affiliates and international organizations swiftly condemned the decision to bar Ajjawi from the country and petitioned for his return. He eventually made it to campus 10 days later, likely aided by Harvard’s name and University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
In 2017, at least four graduate students were also turned away. The Trump administration had implemented a ban — which was later reversed — on travel from seven countries with a majority Muslim population. The students eventually arrived in the United States several weeks later, though one did not make it to campus until eight months later.
International students accepted to Harvard receive visa documentation from the Harvard International Office and apply for visas through the United States embassy in their country of origin. Multiple students said delays in processing those applications have become more common in recent years.
M. Soheil Sadabadi ’20, who is an Iranian citizen, said he has applied for visas to study at Harvard twice, once before his freshman year under the Obama administration and again this year. He said this year State Department officials asked him to supply links to his social media accounts, reflecting a Trump Administration policy announced in June.
“The first time I got my visa — when I was a freshman — my visa took, I think, two or three days,” he said. “However, this past summer, when I applied for my visa in Singapore because I was interning abroad, it took my visa around two and a half to three months.”
Sadabadi added that, much like Ajjawi, he was unsure whether he would be able to begin classes on time this semester.
“I even made plans for study abroad in Russia in the meanwhile, so that I could continue and graduate on time,” he said. “I knew the visa would arrive. It's just that for some Iranians it ends up taking months, sometimes six months, seven months, who knows.”
A State Department official wrote in a statement that student visa policies have not changed, and that the Department supports international students.
“There has been no policy change regarding student visas. National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications,” the statement reads. “Every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes extensive security screening. If an applicant requires additional screening for whatever reason, we will not issue a visa until that screening is complete.”
Once students arrive in the United States, some face further barriers in seeking approval for work authorization.
If they accept a summer job offer in the United States, international students have the option of participating in two programs offered by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services — Optional Practical Training or Curricular Practical Training. CPT covers school-sponsored work; OPT covers professional summer work related to a student’s area of study.
Woodbridge International Society Co-Presidents Paula R. A. Chappel ’20 and Nicolas Weninger ’20 said they help the Harvard International Office advertise events informing students about CPT and OPT. Weninger said the latter has created more problems for students in recent years.
“The issue with OPT is that legally, you can only apply for OPT three months before the start date of that authorization,” he said. “Processing times are taking longer than three months, even though [international students] can't start applying for the application until three months before."
“For summer jobs most people are advised to do CPT and Harvard's really efficient at processing those through,” Chappel said.
HIO also employs a team of advisers that provide pre-arrival information and answer students’ questions.
“Once visa related documentation is issued by HIO, it also provides the recipient with information on the next steps they need to take in order to apply for their visa at the US consular office nearest to them,” Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement. “The recipient also is informed who their HIO advisor is to make them aware of his or her contact information, office hours and other ways they can be contacted.”
HIO’s assistance only reaches so far, though; only federal officials can actually approve visas.
“The International Office has been helpful, but their hands are tied so far as, for example, getting visas, where international offices are basically powerless — they can't do anything,” Sadabadi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s rugby team sent an intimidating message by massively overpowering its Ivy League foe Dartmouth at its home opener last Saturday with a score of 50-32. The match was highly anticipated after the Big Green beat the Crimson to win last year’s National Intercollegiate Rugby Association (NIRA) Championship.
“This was a big game for us,” sophomore Erica Jarrell said. “We work with a headspace coach during preseason and that teaches us to not let any loss or getting scored on affect us negatively. That prepares us for situations like these. Dartmouth is always an important one on the schedule.”
In form with their defending national champion status, Dartmouth opened with the first try of the match. However, it didn’t take long for Harvard to interrupt Dartmouth’s early momentum. Junior Gabrielle Fernandopulle had her first career try which was followed by 26 Crimson points scored by seniors Emily Prentice and Dominique Cantave, and freshman Achele Agada, all for which Dartmouth had no answer.
Part of what helped the Crimson earn their revenge on Saturday were contributions made by new freshman talent. The team’s count of eight freshman makes it the largest recruiting class in the program’s history and the benefits manifested clearly on Saturday.
“We knew we had such great talent coming in this year,” Jarrell said. “With such a high percentage of freshmen we do have to work on chasing the cohesion we had last year. We definitely are starting to emulate that as a team though, and the promise of the new talent that we’ve been excited about for a while has been coming into fruition.”
The second half included more pressure from the Big Green. Emily Prentice opened the second half with another try which was quickly matched by a successful Dartmouth effort. Three consecutive Crimson tries by Agada, Jarrell, and sophomore Cassidy Bargell increased the lead to 50-12.
Dartmouth had multiple tries towards the end, making the final score of 50-32 slightly less lop-sided then what was displayed on the scoreboard for most of the game.
“We had mental and physical edges over them, and when we used these to our advantage in the first 60 minutes or so we definitely outpaced them,” junior Robyn Beese said. “Towards the end we started to let things fly that we didn’t earlier on and we are definitely going to work on being consistent throughout.
The Crimson improved its record to 3-1 on the season and will take on Quinnipiac at home on Saturday, October 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off two straight weekends of tournaments, both the men’s and women’s teams are looking to maintain their momentum after a hot start to the year. The women’s team spent the two weekends in New York City at the Columbia Fall Invite and at home for the Harvard Fall Classic, and on the men’s side, the team competed at the Napa Invite in Napa Valley and at the Ivy Plus tournament in Princeton. New and old faces on the team had their chance to hit the courts and see how their off-season training translated into in-season performance. And for many, the hard training paid off.
On the women’s side, the team captured two tournament wins at the Columbia Fall Invite on the weekend starting on Sept. 13th. Harvard freshman Mihaela Marculescu capped off her inaugural collegiate performance with a defeat of Columbia’s Jennifer Kerr (7-5, 2-6, 10-7), while in doubles, the duo of sophomore Rachel Lim and senior Jenna Friedel defeated a Columbia pair in the final round of flight A, with a score of 6-4.
This past weekend at the Harvard Fall Classic, a number of Crimson athletes came out with a win from their singles matches in straight sets, while the duo of Friedel and senior captain Natasha Gonzalez won their doubles match in a resounding 6-3, leading the way to a team victory on the weekend.
This year’s team comes in fairly young, bringing in a sizable freshman class of five.
“It’s really cool to see them come in with a lot of new energy, a lot of passion,” said Gonzalez, who’s on her final year with the team. “The freshmen did really well both weekends, and then the upperclassmen came in ready to start working again. So the season’s looking really good so far.”
While matches in the fall season are mostly about finding doubles partners, Gonzalez noted that this is the time for the team to grow together and push themselves, hopefully setting the tone for a successful year. Next up for the Harvard women is the ITA All-American Championships on Oct. 5th.
On the men’s side, the Crimson came flying out of the gates with a solid performance in Napa Valley, collecting excellent results coming from their three first-years. Henry von der Schulenburg defeated a USTA athlete 6-2, 6-1, Alan Yim defeated a Michigan athlete 6-3, 6-4, and Ronan Jachuck defeated another Michigan athlete 6-2, 6-4.
While the three freshmen have stepped up to the plate, it’s still been a bit rocky for Harvard.
“It’s been a difficult start to the season because we have four or five guys right now, including myself, who have had little injuries,” said senior captain Logan Weber. “But everyone who’s been playing has been absolutely crushing it.”
The following weekend’s Ivy Plus Tournament at Princeton was highlighted by two Crimson players, Yim and sophomore Harris Walker finishing undefeated in singles play. Walker defeated a Columbia athlete in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, while Yim followed with a 6-3, 7-5 win over a Delaware athlete.
As for what’s next, Weber is confident the team has the potential to be great.
“A lot of the things that we can do to get better has to do with us, merging our different cultures or different backgrounds and figuring each other out and figuring out how to help each other on hard days,” said Weber. “I think that’s really how we’re going to improve because at the end of the day it’s about everyone figuring out how they best compete on court.”
The team has set its targets on a Top 25 placement, NCAA tournament berth, Ivy League championship, and more. And with the high-caliber talent on the team this year, these goals seem far from long shots.

September is almost over. You’ve chosen which clubs you want to comp and which ones to leave. You’ve met up with those friends from last year and promised to hang out just as often even though you don’t have class together anymore or one of you lives in the Quad. Now that everything has settled into a monotonous rhythm, you’re left wondering what happened to all the things you wished to change this year. Maybe campus just isn’t as exciting as it used to be. Regardless of class year, if any of these has been your experience this semester, read on for advice about how to beat the blues.
Talk to People 
At a time when you’re figuring out who you are and the sorts of goals you have for yourself, it can be really stressful to make big decisions like choosing a concentration or joining a new organization. Reach out to friends, family, advisors, and deans and talk about what’s on your mind. The more you put your conflicted feelings into words, the more you will be able to deal with them. The House community is another resource available to you this year, as well as Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services and the Bureau of Study Counsel. It’s a cliche, but comparing yourself to others doesn’t work since everyone is coming from a different place. Try to compare yourself to who you know you used to be, see how much you have grown, and assess how you can grow even more.
Take the Initiative Academically
If you feel like freshman year did not go the way you planned, don’t worry. You can always improve. Take the initiative by going to office hours when you’re confused sooner rather than later, and start assignments early to feel like you have a bit of a grip on things before midterm season. Meet with concentration advisors and students to try to map out your future semesters in your concentration. There are lots of good options, so choose something you like and remember that many Harvard students change their concentrations a couple of times before graduating. Plus, it’s still not too late to drop a class.
Holding on to your friends 
Sometimes relationships are hard to fall back into at the beginning of a new semester. Especially after freshman summer, people have changed and so have you. Maybe it was hard to keep in touch or find common ground on non-Harvard aspects. Still, this is not to say you should abandon last year’s friendships; be honest with your friends, and don’t be shy about texting them to meet up. Scheduling a weekly lunch, dinner, or psetting date can help ensure that you see them. Give it some time to settle back to normal, and remember you will inevitably be meeting new friends too.
Escape the Harvard Bubble
This is often something we plan on doing but have a hard time actually budgeting time for. It’s worth it to escape the Harvard bubble and venture into the outside world. Plan out your semester in terms of papers, presentations, and midterms to determine afternoons or weekends where you can spare a few hours to leave campus. Explore Cambridge and Boston; many museums are free with a Harvard ID, and you can check Facebook for events in the area. Remind yourself that you have a life apart from Harvard to relish and look forward to.
It’s okay to feel worried and anxious as you enter your sophomore year, and if you’re slumping, it’s not the be-all and end-all of your Harvard experience. Know that there are actions you can take to get out of the funk, and even if you can’t make them this semester, there will be many opportunities in the future.

On a warm Saturday afternoon, the streets around Union Square in Somerville were closed to cars and filled with people eating marshmallow fluff. Somerville, Cambridge’s neighbor, boasts the title of home to Fluff. The marshmallow spread was created there in 1907. In order to celebrate their famous creation, Union Square Mainstreets and the Somerville Arts Council hosted the 14th annual What The Fluff? Festival on Sept. 21. The event ran from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. and boasted a variety of fluff-related food and games.
Containers of Fluff were a common sight amongst the vendors at the street festival. Fluff is a marshmallow spread that is common in “Fluffernutter” sandwiches. Fluffernutters are made with peanut butter and Fluff.
Students from Somerville High School walked through the crowd selling their own homemade Fluffernutters in order to raise money for their school’s music department.
The "Dept. of Shenanigans Stage" hosted a variety of Fluff-related games throughout the day. Fluff jousting involved two people balancing on a balance beam and hitting each other with pool noodles covered in Fluff. The goal of the game, played by both children and adults, is to knock your opponent off the balance beam. Other games included a “Fluff Lick-off,” “”Fluff on the Nose” and “Fluff Musical Chairs.”
Children could also play Fluff-related lawn games, including “The Great Fluff Shoot Out,” which entails throwing Fluff lids onto ledges.
In addition to classic Fluffernutters, a wide variety of fluffy food was available for purchase. Jennifer Lee’s Bakery — a gluten, eggs, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame-free bakery — sold treats including caramel sweet potato fluff cake jars and s'mores cinnamon buns.
Gracie’s Ice Cream, an ice cream shop in Union Square, was selling Toasted Fluff Cones for festival goers looking for a cold marshmallow treat.
Fluff was not the only food item for sale — many local food vendors offered their fares at the festival. Food options ranged from Argentinian to India cuisines, with plenty of savory plates.
For those looking to take home souvenirs with a shelf life longer than marshmallow spread, the festival also included Fluff-related merchandise. Fluff keychains, pillows, shirts, hats, and magnets were among the items for sale.
The annual festival attracted attendees of all ages. As the sun began to sink low in the sky, small children peppered the audience as adults battled with pool noodles onstage. Another day in Somerville.
