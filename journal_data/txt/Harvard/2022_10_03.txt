After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here’s a quotation from one of Harvard’s many committees. Try to guess the year it was written.
“Grades A and B are sometimes given too readily — Grade A for work of no very high merit, and Grade B for work not far above mediocrity … One of the chief obstacles to raising the standards of the degree is the readiness with which insincere students gain passable grades by sham work.”
This is from the “Committee on Raising the Standard” in 1894. Ever since letter grades at Harvard were established, perhaps as early as 1883 according to school archives, there's been concern around the way they’re distributed.
There’s still a lot of talk around Harvard’s grade inflation problem today. It’s hardly a surprise to anyone who studies or teaches here that grades have risen over time. But grade inflation is inextricably linked to a worse problem, one that is seldom discussed: grade compression, where GPAs stop increasing and instead stabilize in the 3.8 to 4.0 range.
To understand grade compression, we first need to understand grade inflation. Looking at a graph of student GPAs since 1889 is sort of like looking at a graph of Harvard’s endowment: It only goes up. In 1950, when Harvey Mansfield was but a freshman at Harvard, the average GPA was estimated at 2.55. Now, it’s much closer to 3.80. Keep in mind these numbers are estimated from Crimson surveys that represent only a part of the student body, combined with third-party analyses of Harvard records, so try to focus on the long-term trend rather than specific GPA averages at any point in time.
In addition to GPA, Harvard uses several grade classifications like summa cum laude or the lesser known Dean’s List. In fact, the Dean’s List used to be a brag-worthy achievement. Harvard President Nathan Pusey, according to Harry Lewis’ “Excellence Without a Soul,” boasted in 1954 that Harvard students “may take pride in the fact that last year forty percent of all Harvard undergraduates were on the Dean’s List.” By the time Harvard moved to abolish the Dean’s List, 92 percent of students qualified.
Harvard is not alone in rising grades. Most universities have experienced grade inflation, according to retired Duke Professor Stuart Rojstaczer’s research at gradeinflation.com (not to be confused with gradeinflation.net, which redirects you to Harvard’s homepage — not a joke).
Importantly, the pace of grade inflation – i.e. the rate of grade increases — needs to be distinguished from rising grades. In other words, grades may still increase for the foreseeable future, but will they do so at a slower or faster rate than in the 2000s or 2010s?
It is probable that Harvard’s grade inflation will soon peak and level out in the next decade or two. Unlike the price of a Jefe’s burrito, which has no theoretical limit, GPAs can only go so high: 4.0. If grade inflation continues at its 2021-2022 pace, for example, the average GPA of the Class of 2028 would be over 4.0. I don’t think Harvard would let this happen, so I predict we’ll see grade growth rates slow.
Because grades are being pushed against the 4.0 ceiling, the grades of the student body will converge more and more, a phenomenon called “grade compression.” Think of a bell curve getting tighter and taller, as more and more student GPAs get closer and closer to around a 3.8 or 3.9. Recent data support this view, as grades are increasingly compressing around 3.85, meaning there’s less grade variation between students.
Why is this a problem? Grade compression stops students from making the best pedagogical choices.
When grades weren’t as inflated, a stray C+ or B- was to be expected. As A-’s become the new default and grades stabilize at the upper end, any lower grade is seen as a failure. Because most students receive consistently high scores, the cost of experimenting with hard classes or new subjects substantially rises.
A study of Duke students found that they were more likely to take classes from professors who graded more easily. Harvard students, who can be very risk-averse and afraid of failure, will certainly err towards easier classes or departments.
Grade compression ultimately perverts the liberal arts education, which should center on risk-taking and pushing oneself intellectually instead of sheltering in “easy-A” classes. Harvard hopes that its “liberal arts and sciences philosophy encourages students to step outside their comfort zone,” but how can students ever exhibit genuine curiosity or experiment academically when the potential damage to one’s transcript is so high?
Further, the social economy of grades, in which students receive more praise for getting an A in a gem than they would if they chose to struggle through a truly challenging course and get a B, has taken on a life of its own.
There’s no easy solution to either grade inflation or grade compression. Other colleges have experimented with grade deflation or rationing of As, but changes as radical as those are unlikely to be implemented soon.
Instead, I think sunlight is the best disinfectant. Harvard should immediately release annual grade distributions (they stopped doing so in 2006), allowing greater understanding and analysis of the problem. We can’t, after all, confront a reality we can only understand through extrapolated estimates.
More importantly, if average grades for classes or departments were released, then students’ transcripts could be put into greater context. You may have gotten a C in Math 55 but your potential employer could see the average grade was a B+. Curious students would no longer have to fear pursuing a harder class or concentration.
The damage of grade inflation has largely been done as there’s no hope of returning to a grading scheme where a C is average. But we can still resolve the growing threat of grade compression before it wreaks further havoc on Harvard’s education. Maybe it’s time for another “Committee on Raising the Standard” — 128 years later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I downloaded TikTok in August 2020. After a year and a half of refusing to download the app, I finally acknowledged that I was no longer above TikTok. Three months before that, in high school, I was laughing with my history teacher at the notion that the “app is free and therapy is not,” a line in a Washington Post article.
But one week later, I wholeheartedly agreed: Tik Tok is in fact free! Therapy is not!
As my roommate this past summer worded it, quarantine was a “yellow wallpaper” experience; it was at times so bad that I honestly wished the walls would talk back to me. At that point, anything that could turn my mind off, I’d take. So I downloaded TikTok.
It didn’t take long for me to be shuffled onto Neurodivergent TikTok. The app knew with certainty I belonged there, even if I didn’t consciously know it myself. In between the Kiss Me More videos and Haikyuu animated dances, I saw creators who looked like myself talk about niche experiences I could relate to, from doom boxes to hyperfixations to extreme perfectionism. They shared a language to understand my experiences — the language of neurodiversity. Although it would be another year before I received a formal ADHD diagnosis, I began to realize that I wasn’t alone. Moreover, importantly, there were ways for me to help myself navigate the world, with or without an “official” piece of paper that validated a lifetime of talents, quirks, and struggles. There was a community’s wealth of information at my fingertips, increasingly personalized with every additional second I scrolled.
Considering how Neurodivergent TikTok exploded over the pandemic, it’s safe to say that I’m not the only one who happened to be swept up in its rise. As Kris B. King ’24 explains, with the pandemic, there was a “systemic intersection of factors that led to a massive increase in what we know to be true about neurodivergence.”
For one, professional mental health resources, such as the DSM-5, at best largely lack nuance. For example, behavioral research, including research on autism, relies predominantly on male samples from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies. Needless to say, it’s wholly unsurprising that countless individuals who are not WEIRD males go undiagnosed. And that’s assuming that one has access to professional mental health resources, which are often extremely inaccessible.
“It's not equitable. It's not community driven. It's certainly not centering women. It's certainly not centering trans people. It's certainly not centering low-income people. It's certainly not centering folks of color, and we know how all of these factors influence your mental health outcomes,” King emphasizes.
On the flip side, “we know as a community — a much broader scope of neurodivergent characteristics, of autism characteristics, of allistic neurodivergent characteristics, than mental health professionals are prepared to reckon with,” King continues.
Enter the pandemic: As Tik Tok continued to grow in cultural relevance, the world shut down. With many more people at home, its user base grew massively and content production crescendoed.
As dalgona coffees and self-improvement trended, like everyone else, neurodivergent users (knowing and unknowing) found themselves on the app. And, “in part driven by the isolation and time that neurodivergent people now had on their hands,” the “lower stress of not being required to socialize imparted on those folks,” and the convergence of overarching systemic and cultural factors, there was “a huge surge in neurodivergence related information being spread on Tik Tok,” King tells me.
“Whether or not this information was verified by a mental health professional or not, it didn't really matter because this is a community that has, in essence, in the last 20 years, been responsible for itself,” King notes. Its leaders, primarily “Black and Indigenous women” are heavily involved “in the community doing their own theory work” and consequently, are intimately “familiar with the nuances of neurodivergent presentation and needs across society” providing “a huge equity component” for neurodiversity information on platforms like TikTok.
Suddenly, “a lot more people are now aware of their narrative origins in a way that they weren’t otherwise,” says King, before continuing on: “And I was certainly in that pool. I woke up in December 2020. And was like, ‘Oh shit, I think I'm autistic.’”
Kendall I. Shields ’24 shares a similar experience: “Before the pandemic, I didn't really have the language to describe my own neurodiversity. I definitely didn't know what the word like ‘neurodiversity’ meant,” They continue. “I definitely didn't have the language to describe how my brain works differently than other people’s. And I think I noticed a lot of things like for example, after coming home from school every day, I would just be so overwhelmed from all of that socialization, and I would almost just come home and cry in my room every day as just a way to decompress.”
Shields says that on social media platforms where anyone can become a content creator, marginalized voices can be amplified.
“That’s part of why we saw increasing public understanding of what it means to identify as disabled, what it means to identify as neurodivergent,” they say.
For Shields personally, who has a genetic disorder that’s highly associated with autism, hearing “different people talking about their experiences being autistic,” particularly from “autistic girls and women who might have displayed autistic traits in different ways that were not recognized by kind of the medical establishment,” they began to relate and feel like the things they had experienced that made them think they were just “broken or weird” could have “been the results of autism.”
It was comforting, allowing them to seek out resources to handle situations and feelings that they didn’t have the language for prior.
“Realizing that the experiences I was having were shared and that I wasn’t the only person going through this made me feel like I could be easier on myself,” Shields says.
The neurodivergent movement itself may seem niche, but when the fad of feigning wellness and 32 new hobbies faded, many found solace in the emergent pandemic-era mental health movement. Whether you knew it or not, that movement is one of disability justice, pushed forward by BIPOC advocates who remain overshadowed and under-credited.
Two years later, I still have TikTok. I’ll be the first to admit that the app was my introduction to the neurodiversity movement and broader disability justice. It allowed me to find solace and solidarity with my own neurodiversity and identity. It let me know that I had a community, both online and off.
Because of them, to them, and for them, I share our stories.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I can picture it now. You and your best friend sit in a secluded corner of the dining hall, catching up between bites of Veritaffles, Red’s Best Catch, or some other HUDS classic. Maybe it’s midterm season, and the pile of papers or excess of exams has been gnawing away at your happiness. You start to rant about how hard life has been recently. Before you know it, the floodgates are open. That toxic thing your parents did or the unluckiest day of your life so far is unearthed. Seeing your friend’s shell-shocked stare and palpable discomfort, you realize that you just trauma-dumped.
Not to be confused with ranting or venting, trauma dumping is much more serious. It often involves oversharing intense information without consent, in the wrong place or at the wrong time, with a person who is not prepared to absorb the information — which could explain your hypothetical friend’s uneasy reaction. This definition makes it seem like trauma dumping only strains your relationships with others, but it can also nourish them. Being vulnerable and spilling your guts can bring people closer, making trauma dumping an essential part of friendship-making for some people. Trauma dumping doesn’t have to be awkward or upsetting, like the common definition suggests. With just a few simple steps, you can pull off a better version of a trauma dump: one that maximizes positive vulnerability and sharing, without triggering any embarrassment, shock, or discomfort.
The first step for better trauma dumping is to determine why you want to overshare. There’s surely some deep psychological reason for why you’re looking to unload your life story in general, but what are the social cues of a given moment that make you feel inclined to let the emotional avalanche out? Did your friend just now share a story about their childhood? Did they just finish trauma dumping themself?
The answers to these questions may show that you’re engaging in unhealthy trauma politics. Trauma politics at Harvard, where many students arrive having already sold their life before Harvard as a tragic essay for the admissions office, are complicated. For students that come from less privileged backgrounds, hardship can feel like their only distinguishing factor against wealthier, more well-connected peers. If hearing about your friend’s childhood evokes a strange sense of covert competition before the urge to trauma dump, you might be using your trauma to prove your worth. Although these manifestations of impostor syndrome are powerful, do your best to ignore them. You have value outside of your trauma; you don’t need to relive pain to justify your existence here.
The only right reason to trauma dump is for your own benefit. Perhaps you hope to find catharsis or believe your friend can help you cope. As long as the motivation for trauma dumping centers on you, and you alone, proceed to step two.
Now that you have looked inward and believe that trauma dumping will help you, look outward and consider how trauma dumping will impact your friend. The classic definition of trauma dumping has you oversharing without consent, but a better trauma dump necessitates getting permission before beginning to dump. Today, trauma is a nebulous concept: For some people, it constitutes minor inconvenience, but for others, it carries a much heavier significance. Give your friend a sense of the gravity of your incoming trauma, and ask if they are prepared to listen.
It is possible that your friend is not ready. Listening to another person’s intense emotional experiences can be draining, especially when one is already low on emotional bandwidth. Perhaps the subject you want to talk about is one of your friend’s triggers. If your friend declines to listen, for whatever reason, be understanding and do not push the issue. At this moment rife with strong emotions for yourself, it’s important to have empathy for others’ emotions as well.
Now, imagine that your friend agrees to hear you through. You divulge the details of something in your life. The trauma dump ends. But even though you finished speaking, guilt grips you. You are seized by the impulse to apologize for oversharing.
Stop. You trauma dumped for the right reasons. Your friend declared their willingness to participate. The final step of a proper trauma dump is to not apologize.
Vulnerability is scary: Opening up your insecurities to the greater scrutiny of more eyes feels shameful and thus impossibly difficult. These feelings can protect you from harm in uncertain social situations, but they can also isolate you. If you trust your friend enough to have made it this far in the guide to trauma dumping, do not give in to the temptation to take it all back. You can be open, honest, and authentic around the people you trust without owing them an apology. If you absolutely feel that you have to say something, try gratitude: Instead of apologizing for yourself, thank your friend for their kindness and patience in listening.
With that, a successful trauma dump ends, avoiding any awkwardness, uneasiness, or thoughtlessness. You have gained the benefits of trauma dumping without the harms associated with the typical process. If you want bonus points (and you’re a Harvard student, so I’m sure you do), a final, final step is to be kind to yourself. You are on the cusp of childhood and adulthood, navigating classes and relationships, and still figuring out how to synthesize your experiences to become a capable, functioning member of society. If trauma dumping responsibly while eating Veritaffles makes that any easier, go right ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 said Wednesday that HMS is “more financially stable than at any time in recent history” after recovering from pandemic-era financial stress.
Speaking at his first in-person State of the School address since Covid-19, Daley said HMS balanced its books in fiscal year 2022 “despite all the pandemic challenges, and more than a decade of recurring budget deficits.”
Daley said HMS broke even on discretionary cash flows in fiscal year 2022 for the first time since 2009 — a milestone it was not projected to hit until 2023 because the Medical School waived fees for its affiliate hospitals due to the pandemic.
The school’s Office for External Education brought in $17 million in net revenue in fiscal year 2022, Daley said. HMS also saw increases in its commercialization revenue and sponsored research funding, according to the address.
Daley said HMS worked to invest in research and education in fiscal year 2022 by providing $203 million to subsidize researchers and $30 million to improve educational offerings.
In 2017, Daley launched the Dean’s Innovation Award, which has provided $24 million in extra funding for 92 research projects. Daley lauded the program on Wednesday, saying it would act as a catalyst for additional funding. He pointed to HMS faculty members Gary Yellen and Nathalie Y. R. Agar, who received $500,000 through the Innovation Award program.
“They have since secured nearly $2 million in follow-on funding from the National Institutes of Health,” he said. “That’s what the Innovation Awards program was meant to do.”
Daley also said HMS is “reimagining” the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology curriculum to prepare students “to be the physician-innovators of the future.”
Daley said the school’s investments in two avenues for research funding — the Blavatnik Therapeutics Challenge and the Quadrangle Fund for Advancing and Seeding Translational Research — are “predicated on the core principle that we have an obligation to make our science relevant.”
Daley also discussed the school’s efforts to improve diversity and inclusion on Wednesday, highlighting the school’s Black Staff Caucus, which he said seeks to address the “shared goals and challenges of staffers across HMS.”
“Our community investments are building better pipelines, too,” he said. “We have expanded our faculty promotion criteria to include significant supporting activity for diversity and inclusion.”
Overall, Daley said, investments over the last year in research, teaching, and culture have continued to elevate HMS as a “leading institution,” but that there is always room to grow.
“We cannot rest on what we have done to date,” he said. “We have to continue to strive to become even more responsive to the world’s emerging threats and challenges.”

Crime on Harvard’s campus dropped to its lowest level in over a decade last year, with 37 fewer crimes reported than in 2020, according to a report released by the University on Friday.
The number of crimes reported on campus fell to 142 in 2021, according to data disclosed by the University under the Clery Act — down from 179 in 2020. The drop marks the fourth straight year crime has fallen at Harvard.
The crime data was released Friday in the Harvard University Police Department’s annual security report, which included 2021 campus crime statistics and other general safety information. Colleges and universities that receive federal funding are mandated by the Clery Act to distribute an annual security report to affiliates by October each year. The figures in the report only cover crimes the University is required to disclose by the Clery Act, which was signed into law in 1990.
Harvard saw a sharp decrease in reported burglaries, according to the report. The school’s campus experienced just 17 reported burglaries in 2021 — down from 58 reported incidents in 2020.
Reported motor vehicle thefts on campus spiked to a total of 37 reported incidents last year, more than three times as many as 2020.
Twenty-two rapes were reported on Harvard’s campuses in 2021 — up from 16 the previous year. All but one took place on campus property.
HUPD officers made just four arrests around Harvard’s campuses in 2021, including one near its Longwood campus in Boston and three in Cambridge. Three arrests were related to weapons violations, while one was for a drug violation, according to the report. The department also issued nine “disciplinary actions” — eight for liquor violations and one for a drug law violation. The 2021 arrest total was down from six in 2020.
The department reported four bias-related crimes on campus last year, with three occurring in Cambridge and one in Longwood. One incident of “vandalism motivated by religion” and two assaults — one motivated by disability and another motivated by race — took place in Cambridge, according to the report. One “act of intimidation motivated by race” was reported in Longwood, the report said.
The department’s crime analysis covers the first five months of police chief Victor A. Clay’s tenure. Clay assumed HUPD’s top post in July 2021, promising to reform a police force that has been rocked by allegations of workplace toxicity, sexism, and racism in recent years.
While preparing the annual report, HUPD requests crime information from the Massachusetts State Police and some municipal departments, including Cambridge, Somerville, and Boston.
The Harvard Environmental Health and Safety Department also released its annual report on fire safety on Friday, in accordance with the Higher Education Opportunities Act. One fire was reported in 2021, up from none the previous year.

Allston residents expressed opposition to the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s rezoning plans for the Western Avenue Corridor at a public meeting on Thursday.
Rezoning for the Western Avenue corridor — the area between Barry’s Corner and Leo Birmingham Parkway — would permit the construction of taller buildings of greater density, allowing for more housing units. The provisions are meant to incentivize developers to create more affordable housing.
During the meeting, some Allston residents raised concerns that the proposal could result in rising housing costs and increased traffic.
Paula Alexander, a longtime resident of Allston, questioned the proposal’s ability to decrease housing costs.
“How can you look at us straight in the face, straight in the eye, and say that the density and height equals lower rent when it doesn’t?” Alexander said.
Other attendees raised concerns about the plan’s impact on congestion in the area.
“How can you claim that this is good planning if you are allowing developers to build huge buildings and you know that we may only end up with two, one lane of traffic roads?” Eva Webster, a meeting attendee, asked.
Joseph Blakenship, senior transportation planner at the BPDA, discussed the plan’s goals to increase public transportation and access to sidewalks and bike lanes by 2030, starting with the creation of protected bike lanes along Western Avenue.
Still, Webster was skeptical of the plan’s focus on cyclists and pedestrians over drivers.
“There is a certain mindset right now that dominates development issues in city hall,” she said. “That makes things really good for bicyclists, but bicyclists are only 5 percent of the road users, so how can you possibly turn your back on motorists?”
In response to ongoing resident concerns, Blankenship said the plan draws on the views of multiple stakeholders.
“No plan can build 100 percent consensus, but I think we’ve done a pretty good job of hearing as many perspectives as possible and crafting a vision of this plan that we think is sound,” Blankenship said.
The new zoning plan comes after three years of conversations between the BPDA and residents.
Thursday’s meeting began the final phase of the planning process. After receiving input from local stakeholders, the plan will be considered by the Boston Planning and Development Agency for approval.

Harvard is set to launch a campus-wide mental health awareness campaign, along with a slate of new wellness resources, the University announced Thursday.
The new initiatives are spearheaded by the Implementation Committee on Student Mental Health, led by Provost Alan M. Garber ’76. The committee is charged with implementing the recommendations made by Harvard's Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health, a group convened by Garber in 2019 to analyze the state of student wellbeing at Harvard.
“Strong mental self-care is essential to the long-term success we hope for all our students,” the task force wrote in its 2020 final report.
The new mental health awareness campaign, which was among the recommendations produced by the task force, will be called “We’re All Human.” University administrators wrote in an email Thursday that the school has also developed a virtual learning module, which offers information on “self-care management skills, opportunities to engage in wellness activities, support services offered by the University” and other guidance.
“Across the University, we are committed to changing culture when it comes to our wellbeing and mental health,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email announcing the initiatives to College affiliates. “Harvard should be, and can be, a community that embraces prioritizing wellbeing and eliminates existing stigmas around mental health and seeking care.”
The online learning module marks the first step in kickstarting the University’s campaign.
Students from all of the University’s schools will have access to the module throughout their time at Harvard and can complete the course multiple times. Students are not required to complete the module, but it is recommended.
The “We’re All Human” campaign was developed with input from both undergraduate and graduate students, alongside faculty and staff, O’Dair wrote in her email.
“The Dean of Students Office and many offices within the College and University look forward to working with you and every member of our community to change the culture around wellbeing and mental health,” she wrote.
The University also plans to make wellbeing and mental health resources more accessible by increasing the capacity of its Counseling and Mental Health Service. In March, wait times for new patients to receive an appointment with CAMHS reached roughly six weeks, per Chief of CAMHS Barbara Lewis.
“Intellectual growth and academic achievement should not come at the expense of wellbeing,” the “We’re All Human” campaign website said. “Together, we can create a culture at Harvard that embraces the importance of mental health and wellbeing.”

Convening for its general meeting Saturday, the Harvard Undergraduate Association allocated money for a gender-affirming transition fund and unveiled its newly appointed election commission.
The meeting also saw the appointment of several new team members and representatives, including a director of visual communications, director of grants, and finance administrator.
During the meeting, Brit G. Shrader ’23 presented plans for an HUA-sponsored “Social Transition Fund.”
Starting as early as October, the project would provide grants to subsidize gender identity-affirming products to students who face financial barriers in their social transition.
The since-dissolved Undergraduate Council previously offered a similar fund, which distributed over $6,000 last year, per Shrader’s presentation.
According to Shrader, the simple and anonymous application process of the UC’s analogous program instilled a sense of comfort in those applying.
“We want to prioritize limited bureaucracy, simplicity and privacy above all,” Shrader said Saturday.
HUA leaders also revealed a list of students appointed to the Election Commission at the meeting. The HUA executive board assembled the commission after the Association was forced to nullify their first referendum vote last month because they had not yet appointed the body.
The following students will serve in the commission: Marcella R. Ruppert-Gómez ’23, Thomas O'Neil ’23, Adreanna E. Dillen ’25, Victoria T. Li ’25, Ekene "Ek" Chukwueke ’25, Anna Mikhaylyants ’26, and Vincent Gao ’26. Ruppert-Gomez will serve as the chair.
The commission will facilitate the HUA’s spring officer elections and would oversee any non-constitutional referendums that take place before then.
Eunice S. “Euny” Chon ’25, the HUA’s newly appointed Director of Visual Communications, also spoke at the meeting to review the Association’s strategies for effective social media outreach.
Two new Finance Team positions — director of grants and finance administrator — were also introduced and assigned to Corbin C. Lubiansky ’24 and Salvatore Valentino ’25, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers published a report last week analyzing how European fossil fuel, car, and airline companies use social media to market their work as environmentally friendly.
Geoffrey J.S. Supran, a research fellow in the Department of History of Science, led the project in collaboration with the Algorithmic Transparency Institute. The research was commissioned by the Netherlands branch of Greenpeace, a global environmental advocacy group.
The report defines greenwashing as a form of marketing in which a company tries to make itself appear more environmentally friendly than it actually is, a practice the report describes as “talking ‘green’ but acting dirty.”
The team identified 2,416 social media posts between June 1 and July 31 — a time when Europe was experiencing record-high heat — and reviewed the text and visual components of the posts for signs of greenwashing, “from outright climate denial, to discourses of delay, to narratives of misdirection.”
The team found that 72 percent of social media posts by the oil and gas companies investigated as part of the study engaged in greenwashing, compared to 60 percent of posts by car manufacturers and airlines.
“We interpret greenwashing by the fossil fuel industry to be most blatant, whereas that by airlines is notably subtle,” the report states.
Some social media posts by fossil fuel companies include “subtle imagery of nature” in order to boost public perceptions of the companies’ social responsibility and draw attention away from environmentally unfriendly business practices, the report says.
Supran wrote in an email that the results of the paper point to a shift in the social media communications of fossil fuel companies. Rather than highlighting positive examples of direct engagement with climate change, the companies now prefer to use “deliberate and proactive marketing” to shape public perception “through language and visuals that establish green, innovative, charitable brand identities,” Supran wrote.
The report determined that the presence of nature imagery in social media posts had a statistically significant correlation with the use of marketing language focused on environmental sustainability.
“This probably seems intuitive, and yet to our knowledge this definitely demonstrates for the first time how fossil fuel interests are strategically appropriating the beauty of nature to strengthen their green messaging,” Supran wrote.
He added that cases of climate denial were prevalent especially in the late 1980s and mid- to late 2000s, when fossil fuel companies left a trail of “smoking gun documents” that detailed explicit campaigns to emphasize the uncertainty of climate change and chart rebranding strategies.
Supran wrote that the research will continue to aid congressional investigations and state, county, and city lawsuits against fossil fuel companies for “their decades of climate damages, denial, and delay.”
The report comes amid calls for a ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in the European Union.
Greenpeace EU and 40 other organizations have launched a European Citizens’ Initiative petition — a special type of petition to which the European Commission is legally required to respond if more than one million people sign in less than a year — urging the Commission to ban all advertising for fossil fuels and transport services that use fossil fuels. The petition has obtained just over 350,000 signatures since October 2021.
“Companies need to stop treating the climate crisis as a PR issue that can be fixed with glossy press releases and clever ads,” Supran wrote.
“There’s nothing wrong, of course, with companies communicating their decarbonization commitments and actions to the public,” he added. “The issue here is that they are misrepresenting themselves and misleading the public by generally not putting enough money where their mouths are.”
