Employees at Hobby Lobby no longer receive free insurance coverage for certain contraceptives, despite the recently passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act specifying that such health plans must provide coverage for “all Food and Drug Administration…approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity as prescribed by a provider,” per the Health Resources and Services Administration’s guidelines.
 
Although we respect individual objections to emergency contraceptives, we don’t think a non-religious corporation ought to be legally regarded as having religious beliefs that can be compromised. The Supreme Court will soon be ruling on this issue, and we urge them to restore coverage to employees of Hobby Lobby.
 
In Hobby Lobby v. Sebelius, a majority of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit granted an exemption to Hobby Lobby from the Affordable Care Act, stating that “the First Amendment logic of Citizens United” could be extended to reason that the corporation, as a person, had its free exercise of religious belief infringed upon by the federal government.
 
Hobby Lobby’s core legal argument is based upon the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which stipulates that the federal government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.” But the court and Hobby Lobby are both wrong in believing that the Affordable Care Act is burdening free exercise of religion.
 
It is not, for multiple reasons. As the Department of Justice notes in its brief on the matter, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act carries “forward the existing distinction between non-profit, religious organizations, which may engage in the exercise of religion, and for-profit, secular corporations, which may not.” A church can legitimately claim to have religious beliefs as a corporation, but Hobby Lobby cannot. Additionally, providing access to health plans which offer contraceptives (to employees who may or may not share the religious beliefs of the company’s leaders and who are capable of making belief-based choices on their own) is difficult to construe as a “substantial burden” on anyone’s personal exercise of religion.
 In Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the majority stated that the speech of corporations is equivalent to the speech of “citizens, or associations of citizens.” The 10th Circuit Court is guilty of egregiously flawed logic in attempting to take this idea and extend it to imply that a secular corporation can be regarded as having religious beliefs.

In the theater of the absurd that often becomes of Birthright’s trips for Diaspora Jewish youths to Israel, few moments are stranger than the detour into the Negev desert to the now-canonical “Bedouin tent.” Pitched by businessmen for tourists, stocked with modern comforts, and designed with intra-Jewish coupling in mind, the airy tent becomes a romantic stand-in for the experience of the Negev Bedouin, one of two varieties of “Good Arab” in the official Israeli imagination. “You see, hevre,” I imagine a guide explaining to a bunch of clueless American Joshes and Jeremies, “the clannish Bedouins don’t want trouble like other Arabs—they’re loyal to the State of Israel, and serve as excellent scouts in the army!”
  
What he says nothing about, I imagine, is the fact that within a matter of months, the Israeli government will be expelling between 30,000 and 40,000 Bedouin citizens of Israel from their traditional villages, razing their homes, and resettling them in state-built townships according to its own semi-private master plan. 
  
Although the Israeli parliament voted by a substantial margin to approve the Begin-Prawer Plan—said by its supporters to be a remedy for the rural squalor in which many Bedouins live—at no point did a single one of the potential deportees get a chance to vote on his future. This should come as no surprise: Ethnically and geographically distant from the Israeli Jewish elite and long seen as a slow-to-anger, apolitical constituency, Bedouins have experienced nothing like the equal citizenship described by Birthright’s “Good Arab” mythmakers. But as anywhere between one-seventh and one-fifth of the Negev Bedouin population is forcibly transferred, it is easy to imagine that the Israeli state will once and for all lose the support of a substantial minority population—transforming the Negev into a problem region (politically speaking; it already is one in economic terms), while forcing young Adam and Rachel to find another tent in which to mate, their Bedouin hosts sufficiently disillusioned. 
  
Before you begin to shake your head in exasperation with “the Zionist settler-colonials,” dear reader, consider the following: It has happened in America—more often, more recently, and closer by than you think. In the mid-20th century, “master builder” Robert Moses asserted non-governmental control over the planning show in New York City, advocating for large-scale displacements to make room for his massive, Progressive-minded infrastructural projects. Speaking in the name of New Deal reformism but shot deeply through with contempt for African-Americans and ethnic immigrant whites, he set into motion the shattering of entire neighborhoods, including my grandparents’ in the Bronx, in order to make room for such projects as the Cross-Bronx Expressway and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Say what one will about his insensitivity, but there’s little doubt that Robert Moses’ infrastructural colossi made getting around core and metropolitan New York easier, faster, and more economical. 
  
For whatever impulse toward ethnic cleansing might underlie the Begin-Prawer Plan, its stated purpose—one not terribly unlikely to be achieved—is the improvement of Bedouins’ material standard of living by getting them on the infrastructural grid and into the loop of government services. Provocatively posing the benefits of the resettlement plan to a left-liberal audience, Meirav Arlosoroff writes in Ha’aretz that Begin-Prawer commits the state to spending 2.5 billion shekels ($711 million) on new and existing Bedouin townships—and will finally force the state to deliver services to a sector frequently neglected because of the state’s very refusal to recognize its communities as legal. Ms. Arlosoroff might possibly be right—the benefits of aggressive development might well outweigh the moral revulsion of forced population transfers—just as Robert Moses might in some sense have been instrumentally right to have displaced my grandparents. 
  
But there is reason to doubt the wisdom of authoritarian government solutionists, convinced that communities will at the end of the day be grateful to the bulldozers that demolish them. This was the overarching theme of "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," a 1961 masterpiece by Robert Moses’ archrival, Jane Jacobs. If you enjoy Greenwich Village or SoHo, know that it is due to the strenuous objections of Jacobs to Robert Moses’ doctrine of top-down urban planning that a Lower Manhattan Expressway doesn’t exist in these neighborhoods’ stead. Crafting a bold theory of urban social capital, she argued that without eyes on the street, urban planners failed to appreciate the harm that heavy-handed reshaping of the cityscape wrought on the social and economic productivity of neighborhood communities—bringing about crime, disillusionment, and flight in their attempts to engineer perfect cities. 
  
The Jacobsian conservative argument against the Begin-Prawer Plan couldn’t be clearer: Shattering long-established Bedouin communities for the sake of putatively efficient allocation of land and services will devastate social capital in an already marginalized, impoverished community on the fringes of Israeli society. If the Bedouin and Jewish development townships alike are any indicator of the likely outcome of mass settlement projects in the Negev, would-be Robert Moseses ought to take pause: No intensity of flow from the government spigot has seemed to be able to quench the problems of crime, delinquency, and disillusionment that result from being herded into shabby, boring, and artificial places. 
  
These concerns about the practicality of Bedouin resettlement must be coupled with the moral case against deportation—lest Israeli planners continue down the hazardous road of Moses in the desert.

There was recently an addition to the general frenzy that is Annenberg Hall, against the cacophonous background of clattering dishes and freshmen’s shouts. With lots of emphatic gesticulations and alternating expressions of both approval and disbelief, a friend of mine and I were engaged in a conversation, contentious to the point of farce, about the proper civic and legal channels for revitalizing the American political system.
Normally, I would not consider my personal conversations worthy of being repeated, let alone shared with an audience of readers, but since this one addressed—as much as any conversation between two freshmen could—the causes and symptoms of the current American political dysfunction, some parts will be (not too painfully, I hope) recapitulated here.
He and I, who both identify as liberals and have the same political agenda, asserted very different philosophical interpretations of the roles of law and civic engagement as they pertain to American politics. The discussion began amicably, with our pinpointing the same source of political corruption: the systematic legitimization, by the Supreme Court, of unfettered campaign contributions. 
The Court has retreated from its rulings in the 1989 case Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the 2003 case McConnell v. FEC, in which it upheld the constitutionality of campaign finance restrictions as measures not only reasonable but also necessary for protecting against actual corruption and the “appearance of corruption.” Now rejecting this interpretation of Congressional regulatory powers, the majority of the Court has asserted, most notably in the 2010 case Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, that money is political speech, protected by the First Amendment. The Court has said that all sources of independent expenditures, whether issued from a single “speaker” or a corporation, must be granted equal latitude as “speech.” Political speech, publicly spoken and expressed through democratic channels, is now on equal legal footing with private, anonymous financial donations to Super PACs and the like.
While my friend acknowledged the effects of campaign finance deregulation upon the practice and character of the American system of government, he argued that the present state of political gridlock and discordance was less a symptom of deregulation and more of voter ignorance and disengagement. The strength of government, he argued, was contingent upon civic engagement, and the strength of civic engagement upon education. 
I entirely agreed with this point. As Horace Mann, the champion of free and compulsory public education, wrote in 1848, “It may be an easy thing to make a Republic; but it is a very laborious thing to make Republicans; and woe to the republic that rests upon no better foundations than ignorance, selfishness, and passion!” 
Similarly, Alexis de Tocqueville described in 1835 the American political process as a “science” perfected through common experience and practice. “The most democratic country on the face of the earth is that in which men have, in our time, carried to the highest perfection the art of pursuing in common the object of their common desires and have applied this new science to the greatest number of purposes. Is this the result of accident, or is there in reality any necessary connection between the principle of association and that of equality?” With the language of civic equality made manifest in both its founding documents and in its political structure, American government requires the continued “diffusion of education,” as Horace Mann put it, to enable citizen engagement. 
But this vision of this interaction between the citizen and the law, described perhaps most cogently by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in “The Social Contract,” can only apply to a system of governance in which the “general will” that directs the course of political affairs originates from within the citizenry and not from a private, external source.
If voters were made aware, my friend argued, of the extent to which monetary contributions influence elected officials, then surely citizens would take it upon themselves to find potential candidates among them to return civic character and public function to American political offices. Representative—in the true sense of the word—democracy would be restored. While this would be ideal, the candidate with the greatest financial resources will be the one who captures the election, for his own gain and also on behalf of the interests he represents. His election will help to ensure that the status quo—deregulation and the disproportionate influence of private interests that it engenders—remains in place.
The influence of money must be removed from American law and politics. Representative democracy is contingent upon the notion that citizens are of equal standing; their collective will should be made manifest in law. If financially powerful groups are allowed to capture entire political institutions for themselves, then, in effect, representative democracy is supplanted by an oligarchic system of influences. Financial prowess can and will drown out the political speech of a popular movement; the latter cannot overcome the immense resources of the former. For this reason, it is only through the judicial system that the capacity for political expression can be restored to its rightful speakers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Wandering alone though downtown Washington, D.C., on a Friday night, I stumbled upon a brass band on a street corner in Chinatown. There was a tuba, two trombones, a few trumpets, and a man on a drum set, bopping and sliding, smiling and swaying, playing out upbeat, brassy tunes for the whole city to hear.
 
It can be easy to ignore street performers, but this band grabbed the attention of almost every pedestrian walking by. The tune was so infectious, so delightful, that everyone who heard the band swerved toward the music and began to dance along. The crowd of dancing, happy people grew so big that the police showed up. Instead of breaking up the act (as I half expected them to do) the policemen mobilized to block off the street so that the growing crowd of dancers could spill off the sidewalk onto the asphalt. Within half an hour, hundreds of strangers were dancing together, unprompted, in Chinatown’s lamplight.
 
As I jived to the beat and surveyed the crowd I thought about how these performers had achieved a huge success. Tonight, they had made the lives of many unsuspecting strangers more joyful, more memorable. The world was a brighter place because these musicians had set up their brass band on a street corner.
 
As I play with ideas about what I will do after college, I worry that my post-graduate career may never get close to achieving the sweet, staggering success of those performers on that summer night. I could go to work every day, work hard, push myself, make progress, get promotions, and never discover the far-reaching consequences of my actions for people in rural North Dakota or metropolitan Hong Kong. I could go to work every day, work hard, and have no clue as to whether my efforts were objectively making the world a better place.
 
Of course, not every contribution to society will spark instantaneous joy. Enduring improvement is just as valuable, and many would argue more valuable, than the momentary bliss that comes from lighting up a street with brassy melodies for a few evening hours. But though the flicker of a grin on the face of a passerby is ephemeral, few can deny that the musicians birthed something valuable that evening.
 
The street corner musicians knew the impact they wanted to have on their city, and the smiles and dancing that erupted around their act proved that their impact had been realized. But for many of the jobs we will seek after graduation, the impact that our efforts have on our communities, our cities, our nations, and the world is less clear.
 
In going to work at a non-profit, one could be helping to fight against a major world inequality or one could be putting a bandage on a more systemic problem. By choosing to become a reporter one could help make marginalized voices better heard, or one could inadvertently exploit someone’s words for a purpose the speaker never intended. We could start doing wrong before we realize the consequences of our actions. When a job is embedded in a large, multi-faceted institution or a massive world issue, the far-reaching implications of our work will likely be obscured for much of the time that we are employed, if not forever.
 
Even though we may never know how the things we do ultimately transform the world, we can recognize the values we hold and commit ourselves to working towards them. For example, I care about having a diverse array of experiences that help me better relate to people from different backgrounds. I care about doing something that someone will remember because it affected his or her life positively. I care about being financially independent and having time to devote to people and relationships. I hope to do more good than harm.
 
The professionals profiled in my column this semester could articulate what they valued, and they achieved fulfillment when they found ways to steer their work so that it aligned with their value system. Ernest L. Greer ’88 believes in racial inclusivity, so he spends as many hours fighting for enhanced inclusivity in Atlanta’s arts and education circuits as he does working in law. Anne Taintor ’77 devotes her artistic and business skills to making tokens that will make people laugh while encouraging them to question public representations of women. Dan M. Pallotta ’83 finds ways to transform ambitious adventure and athletic pursuits into financial support for causes people care about, and Meg B. Swift ’93 bases her career around the people and organizations that she feels best support the needs of those less fortunate.
 
None of these Harvard alums would have been able to chart their future paths as seniors at the College, but they probably would have been able to articulate what they valued and thought deserved attention in the world.
 
Fulfillment will come when we identify our values and act towards them. Whether we are aiming for smiles on the street, tweaks to a system, or a more inclusive discourse, it matters not so much what we do as a job but rather how our work can ultimately strengthen and support our beliefs. In our four years at Harvard each of us has continued to construct and rehearse a unique set of values. When the real world hits us, let’s perfect those values by ensuring our jobs put them into practice.

A student was dismissed from the College in late November after multiple instances of alleged sexual misconduct, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced at the faculty’s monthly meeting on Tuesday.
Smith told faculty members at the meeting that “the student had violated the Faculty’s policy on sexual assault and other sexual misconduct by engaging in multiple incidents of serious and persistent unwanted sexual contact.” He did not name the student, who Smith said has been notified of the decision. FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal also declined to identify the student, who was dismissed after a vote of the Faculty council on Nov. 20.
Smith said on Tuesday that 12 members of the council voted in favor of the dismissal, with none opposed and two members abstaining.
Dismissals from the college are rare. The last known dismissal was in 2010, when the Faculty council voted to dismiss an undergraduate accused of hacking into the online accounts of the teaching staff in his courses.
According to the Harvard college Handbook for Students, dismissal does “not necessarily preclude a student’s return,” but reinstatement requires another vote of the Faculty council and is “granted rarely.” An expelled student, on the other hand, cannot be offered readmission.
Cases of potential dismissal or expulsion are first heard by the Administrative Board, which can vote to require the student to withdraw from the college. The Ad Board can then recommend to the Faculty council that the student be dismissed or expelled.
FAS voted to delegate its review authority over dismissals and expulsion within the college and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to the Fac- ulty council in October 2009. Prior to the change, a dismissal needed to be approved by a vote of the full faculty. The change was one of many originally proposed by the committee to Review the Administrative Board in its April 2009 report.
Beyond the 2010 hacking case, students have been dismissed from the College in the past in cases involving offenses such as rape and assault. Neal declined to provide more information about offenses in past cases that have resulted in dismissals.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 7, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the outcome of the Faculty Council vote to dismiss the student accused of sexual misconduct, due to erroneous information from Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal. In fact, the Council voted 12 in favor, none opposed, with two abstaining for the student's dismissal.

Former Governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa discussed the challenges facing his country’s economy and defended past economic policies in the face of criticism from world leaders and the media at the Harvard Kennedy School on Thursday afternoon.
Shirakawa, who served as central bank governor from 2008 through this past March, presided over some of the country’s most challenging economic times in recent history, including the global financial crisis in 2008 and a tsunami and earthquake that ravaged the country in 2011. 
Although many have criticized Japanese economy as poorly-run, Shirakawa explained the origins of Japan’s economic difficulties and compared them to other developed countries. 
“Japan is treated as unique in the world and as having a struggling economy that resulted from policy failures,” Shirakawa said. “Japanese politicians are not infallible, but it’s important to know that there were other factors as well.” 
Another myth Shirakawa sought to dispel was the notion of Japan’s ‘lost decades’—a phrase that economists and other commentators have used to label two decades of economic stagnation in Japan after a gradual crash in asset prices in the late 80s.
According to Shirakawa, the phrase ‘lost decades’ is misleading because the country’s economic difficulties were very similar to the ones Western nations are experiencing today. 
“Japan’s economy in the 1990s was the direct result of the bursting of an economic bubble,” he said. “This is very similar to the burst in the West post-2008, and in fact, the growth rates of Japan’s GDP per capita were about average among developed countries at the time.” 
Although bubble bursts are universal, Shirakawa expressed concerns about Japan’s rapidly aging population and hopes that economists and policy-makers would address this problem. 
“Japan has to increase labor productivity in the workforce, and specifically among women,” Shirakawa said. “The decline in the number of workers has direct correlations on Japan’s economic growth.” 
Shirakawa also emphasized the importance of the central bank’s ability to stabilize the economy through proactive measures with an example from the 1990s, when the BOJ supported the economy by intervening in the stock markets. 
“The Bank of Japan purchased bank stocks to prevent huge economic collapses,” he said. “In this way, we were able to prevent massive unemployment.”
Finally, Shirakawa noted that Japan’s economic situation provides lessons for the international community, especially now that Western countries are experi- encing similar economic difficulties.
“Japan’s experience offers a lot of implications for other countries,” he said. “We have to take into account global commonalities and unique so- cietal features when making policy recommendations.”

The majority of young adults disapprove of current healthcare reform efforts and their approval rating of President Barack Obama is at its lowest point since 2009, according to Institute of Politics poll results that were released Wednesday.
The national poll, conducted biannually by the IOP, surveyed 2,089 members of the millennial generation—young Americans aged 18 to 29—on a range of political and economic issues, including perceptions of government officials and opinions on the federal deficit. 
According to the IOP’s report, 41 percent of young adults surveyed approved Obama’s performance, an 11 percent drop from last year, and 52 percent of respondents aged 18 to 24 said they would choose to remove him from office if given the chance. Similarly, the report indicated that support for members of Congress has dropped since last year, with approval rates for Democrats and Republicans at 35 percent and 19 percent, respectively.
“I’m surprised by the way in which the relationship between Obama and the millennials [has] soured,” said Director of Polling for the IOP John D. Della Volpe, who led the study group of undergraduates who conducted the survey. “If you asked me four or five years ago, I don’t think I would’ve predicted this. Millennials are beginning to answer more like preceding generations over time.”
The report also revealed that over half of all respondents disapprove of the Affordable Care Act, with over three-fourths of respondents saying that they believed their quality of care would stay the same or get worse under the Affordable Care Act.
Some of this disapproval, according to IOP Director C.M. Trey Grayson ’94, stems from the media’s coverage of problems with the government’s health- care website and the impact of the ACA on young adults. 
Survey respondents also weighed in on student and federal debt. The poll indicated that millennials across the political spectrum classify student debt as a “major problem,” with 42 percent of respondents believing colleges and universities are most responsible for rising student debt. Thirty percent attributed the problem mainly to the federal government. On the issue of decreasing the federal deficit, 69 percent of respondents endorsed the Buffett Rule, which would require those making over $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, and 71 percent supported slashing foreign economic aid in half. 
Della Volpe said that the millenials’ general disapproval of the government results from their “passion” for solving current issues. 
“They’re passionate about government, they’re passionate about America, and they want to go to work and solve the issues that are facing this generation and future generations,” he said. “They’re upset with Washington today, but they care deeply about their country and the role that government can have in helping solve the problems of the future.” 
Grayson added that the IOP has witnessed a “significant reengagement” of young adults in the political process since the first poll was taken in April of 2000. Nearly 68 percent of millennials are registered to vote. 
Della Volpe said that he hopes the poll results will encourage politicians to engage with young Americans. 
“I’m hoping that Democrats and Republicans in D.C. look at the study and realize that there’s a very serious issue of trust between government and younger Americans,” Della Volpe said. “In order to heal that fracture between young people and government, both sides need to be more collaborative, work together, and listen to younger people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a quiet night in Lowell House dining hall, one Harvard senior—who agreed only to be identified by the pseudonym Ivar—smiled reluctantly and glanced at his hands as he recounted a conversation he never expected to have.
“I get this call from my mom, and she’s like, ‘Why the hell are you going to a LGBT dating event?’” he said. “She was going through this whole thing like, ‘Please don’t do this, please don’t do this to me!’”
Ivar, an international student who identifies as queer, was inadvertently outed to all of his Facebook friends a couple of years ago after deciding to RSVP to his first queer dating event on the site. Unbeknownst to Ivar, the event showed up on his profile and was visible to confused family and friends from his hometown, where he said talking about queerness is “taboo.”
Ivar, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he is not out to everyone in his hometown, said that he was “shocked” and “upset” that all of his Facebook friends could see the post. He wanted to hit a ‘delete’ button, but realized he was too late.
“It was suddenly a test of emotions,” said Ivar, who immediately began questioning himself after the incident. “‘Why are you doing this? Why is this happening? You’ve come so far, don’t do this to yourself,’” he told himself.
Ivar is not the only Harvard student who has been inadvertently outed via Facebook—several other students shared similar stories of how their sexuality was exposed via the Internet. These incidents reveal a constant danger with social media use—despite the privacy settings sites offer, the difficulty of keeping information private remains.
Queer students, especially, have found that ‘the closet’ on the Internet does not provide a very good lock.
A Latch Left Undone?
As social media blurs the lines between home life and academic life, Harvard students interviewed said that those who are still coming to terms with their sexuality may have a particularly hard time keeping their identity secret until they feel ready to come out.
Fred, a sophomore who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because people in his hometown do not know that he is queer, was not out to his family when he joined Queer Students and Allies at Harvard.
“My dad used to be really, really, really unaccepting of queer people, like he hated them,” Fred said. 
Fred’s Harvard friends posted on his Facebook page about BGLTQ groups, and his family and friends saw the posts before he could censor them. His sudden outing provoked a harsh reaction from his dad. 
“My dad asked me, ‘Why are you a homosexual?’” Fred said. 
Understanding Facebook’s privacy settings can be challenging, particularly due to frequent policy changes. Because of incidents like these, students said that they have become more cautious when using social media sites. 
“I know a lot of people who are very careful about how they use social media during that process between realizing that they’re queer and deciding to fully come out,” said Allison Gofman ’14, a leader of the queer Jewish organization BAGELS. “I certainly did that too during the process.” 
Since his inadvertent coming-out, Ivar said that he has been particularly mindful about his presence on social media. 
“Now whenever I post stuff like, ‘I’m going to this event,’ or I post, ‘I’m very happy that gay rights is legal here,’ I’ll usually make it visible to certain friends,” Ivar added. 
Queer Confidential 
Most of the BGLTQ groups on campus have varying forms of privacy clauses in their constitutions that allow students to hide or censor their membership to preserve confidentiality. 
“Some [queer groups] are especially focused on being safe spaces where people can kind of explore themselves and come to terms with themselves,” Gofman said. “It’s important that you feel free to have people to talk to without having that go out to the whole world.” 
QSA, the largest queer student group on campus, goes to great lengths to ensure students’ privacy by instituting policies regarding posting photos or recording names of members who speak during meetings. They also allow club officers to go by aliases on their website. 
“In the end, because it’s such a sensitive topic, I think [confidentiality] is something we always need to take into consideration in everything that we do,” QSA Co-Chair Neimy K. Escobar '15 said.
Though these organizations have taken conscientious measures to preserve confidentiality, concerns about being outed over social media persist, and student group leaders said that they will continue to go to great lengths to ensure that their members feel safe. 
“You may not talk to members outside of QSA about queer-related things if you don’t have permission beforehand, because we don’t want to out anyone,” QSA Political Co-Chair W. Powell Eddins '16 said. 
Doors Wide Open 
Although Ivar and Fred said that their initial experiences of being inadvertently outed were traumatic and stressful, both ultimately embraced their sexuality and reconciled with their families. 
Upon the insistence of his stepmother, Fred’s father gradually became more accepting of his son’s sexuality. 
“It was a little bit awkward because he makes hard comments sometimes or is completely inappropriate, but for the most part he’s been supportive,” Fred said. 
Ivar said that his mother has also “gotten used to” his sexuality. He then later came out to his father, whose initial resistance turned into acceptance over time. 
“Maybe it was good that I pressed ‘Attend’ [on that Facebook event] because I found out that even people back home, despite the social stigma of [homosexuality], are really supportive,” Ivar said. 
Meanwhile, Harvard administrators have made strides in making the College a welcoming space for queer students. In 2011, the College established the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, which offers more support for queer students by providing queer resources, hosting events, and maintaining a safe space in Boylston Hall. In 2011, the Office of Student Life initiated a pilot program for gender-neutral housing in six undergraduate houses. 
Despite the challenges of confronting one’s sexual identity at school, students now said that they feel more comfortable expressing their sexuality and exploring their identities at Harvard. 
“Should I not be free to express myself regardless? Back home I can’t do it, but while I’m here I feel I at least should have the opportunity to express myself in a place where it’s permitted,” Ivar said.

The American media now portrays Muslims with the same negativity that it does North Korea and Moammar Gadhafi, founder and CEO of Media Tenor International Roland Schatz told a crowded CGIS auditorium Thursday.
Schatz, whose company specializes in global media content analysis, was one of six panelists gathered to discuss a program titled “Perceptions of Muslims in the West: Discourses after the Boston Bombing and the Woolwich Murder.” 
Panelists commented on topics that ranged from the reliability of American media outlets to the proliferation of Muslim organizations. Those organizations, panelists said, can dispel misconceptions about Islam. 
Panelists also highlighted the use of social media during the Boston bombings and subsequent lockdown last April. 
Maria Ebrahimji, a former executive editorial producer for CNN, tracked tweets during the bombings and lockdown. At the time, many Muslim account holders worried that the bombers would turn out to be Muslim, feeding the already negative portrayal of Islam by the American media, she said Thursday.
Indeed, reporting during the April lockdown included “a lot of misleading and a lot of misreporting,” Ebrahimji said. Premature stories aired that misidentified suspects and played into racial stereotypes. 
Academia, she said, can help improve the portrayal of Muslims in the media. 
“Terrorists are not born. They’re made,” said Diane Moore, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Divinity School. According to Moore, academics can help examine the cultural context in which some Muslims are radicalized. 
Panel attendee Rachel Foran expressed optimism about the beneficial impact of academia, where she said she 
sees an opportunity “to incorporate academic narratives about Islam” into conversations about public policy. 
Panelist Suhaib Webb, an imam at the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, disagreed. “Masses of Americans are not concerned with what is happening in academia,” Webb said. “The media, however—they definitely have a lot of power.” 
Webb noted that a growing body of organizations that advocate for Muslims have begun to leverage the media to change public opinion about the Islamic community. For example, the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a think tank whose research focuses on public policy in relation to the the U.S. and the Muslim community, has launched a campaign to address misperceptions about Islam utilizing op-eds and press conferences. 
These campaigns, Webb said, can help destigmatize the Muslim community in media. 
“It is our voices that will make the difference in this conversation,” he said.

Transgender art provides an important framework to reflect on gender and identity, panelists said at an event dis- cussing and showcasing transgender and genderqueer arts on Wednesday.
“Art isn’t inherently trans or genderqueer, but it might deal with some of the implications of some of those experiences,” said panelist and doctoral student Michael M. Weinstein. 
The event included performances by queer artists including Kate Bornstein and a panel discussion on the impact and implications of transgender and genderqueer arts. 
Panelists noted that trans arts can help amend traditional ideas about the transgender experience. 
For example, they debated whether the transgender experience known as “passing” could itself be seen as performance art. Passing refers to being perceived by others, particularly strangers, as the gender you identify as. 
Women, Gender, and Sexuality professor Michael Bronski argued that if one views passing as a form of street theater or other theatrical performance, then success or failure to “pass” can pro- vide commentary on gender in society. 
Panelists also noted that trans art has the potential to create a more flexible image of gender. 
“I want to see in trans art, not that gender needs to be destroyed, but that we need more frameworks to see gender,” panelist Kat M. Baus ’15 said. “That it can be a serious part of someone, but also something fun.” 
Jacqueline Hargrove, a doctoral student at UMass-Boston who attended the event, agreed. 
“[Transgender art] just helps to question your own identity, and understand your own biases about who you are and how you see other people,” she said. 
Hargrove was particularly enthusiastic about the performance by artist Kate Bornstein. 
Bornstein performed her signature piece On Men, Women, and the Rest of 
Us, which incorporates stand-up comedy, theatrical monologues, and slam poetry to reflect on her transgender experiences. 
Alicia Ortiz, a community organizer who works on BGLTQ advocacy, said that she believed Kate Bornstein presented an important and universal message. 
“Everybody should hear and experience [the performance] and realize that all of us have work to do to do with ourselves to understand our experiences in this world.” Ortiz said. “Our gender, our sexuality–none of that is a given, and it’s important to think of that, no mat- ter what our path around those things might be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard College under national scrutiny after Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris revealed Tuesday that students at the College are more likely to receive an A than any other grade, faculty members told The Crimson that they do not have to meet a particular grade distribution and that they are not overly concerned about the potential consequences of high grading averages.
At Tuesday’s monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harris said that the median grade at the College is an A- and the most commonly awarded grade is an A. The information cast Harvard into the national spotlight and prompted allegations of soft grading standards at the College. 
Yet multiple professors defended their grading practices in interviews with The Crimson on Thursday.
“We use the evaluation process to promote learning. Unless there is a feeling among the faculty—and I don’t think there is—that students aren’t learning, than I don’t think we will be too concerned about grade distribution,” said Andrew D. Gordon, a professor of history and East Asian Languages and Civilizations. 
Gordon said that in the departments in which he teaches, professors are not instructed to grade to a certain distribution. Computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 and chair of the mathematics department Benedict H. Gross ’71, two former deans of the College, said that their departments also do not mandate certain distributions. 
“I try to give everyone the grade they deserve,” said Lewis, who is also the director of undergraduate studies in computer science. “The students vary from year to year, the assignments vary from year to year, sometimes there are exam questions that no one can solve. It wouldn’t make any sense to have a fixed correlation of raw scores to letter grades.” 
When asked if he believed rising grades meant that Harvard was getting easier aca- demically, Lewis responded firmly. 
“No. Not in my part of Harvard,” he said. 
Since the news of the grade distribution broke, many have echoed a claim made in 2002 by former University President Larry Summers that inflated grades might hurt Harvard graduates when they search for employment or apply to graduate school.
Professors interviewed by The Crimson, however, said that grade point average, while sometimes important, is only one of many factors that influence post-Harvard opportunities. 
“If the only thing that people looked at when our graduates went on to other things were the grades, then it might be a problem,” Gordon said, adding that employers and graduate schools consider standardized test scores, work experience, and faculty recommendations in their decisions as well. 
Lewis expressed a similar sentiment. 
“For applications to graduate school, what the faculty say about you is a lot more important than what the grades say,” he said. “Those things tend to be correlated, of course, but it’s not the grade, per se.” 
Some of Harvard’s peer institutions, including Princeton University, order instructors to award A-range grades to only a certain percentage of students. Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, whose question at Tuesday’s FAS meeting compelled Harris to share the distribution data, told The Crimson on Wednesday that he believes Harvard should have a “firmer” grading system with caps similar to Princeton’s. 
None of Harvard’s top administrators have commented publicly since news of the distribution broke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a long-standing research partnership at the University and a family that boasts five Harvard degrees, visiting professor Kay Schlozman does not have a hard time navigating the Harvard landscape.
Schlozman has served as a visiting professor six times since 1987, filling student demand for a variety of specific courses in both the Government and Women, Gender, and Sexuality departments. This fall, Schlozman has returned to teach a new course for undergraduates, Government 1545: “Gender and Politics.”
But Schlozman’s connection with the University goes beyond her academic work. Her two children—Daniel A. Schlozman ’03 and Julia E. Schlozman ’09—hold five degrees in total from the University. After attending the College, Daniel went on to earn a master’s degree and Ph.D. in political science, and Julia graduated from Harvard Law School this past spring.
Despite her substantial academic and personal investment in Harvard, Schlozman’s allegiance remains with Boston College, where she serves as the assistant chair of the political science department and where she will return following her visiting professorship.
In her dual roles, Schlozman has spent this fall trekking back and forth between the two schools, filling holes in Harvard’s academic curriculum while fulfilling her roles as a mentor and administrator at Boston College.
FILLING A NEED
As Harvard continues to tighten its budgetary belt, visiting professors such as Schlozman have become a mainstay on campus, filling departmental needs without necessitating additional faculty. This year, 41 visiting professors were welcomed to campus, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
“Visiting faculty help ensure that we can offer a diverse range of classes and perspectives to both undergraduate and graduate students,” Neal wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Harvard reached out to Schlozman last spring after a student movement called for a course on gender and politics—an area which some students claimed was missing from the government department’s curriculum.
“It’s an issue that needs to be addressed—it’s an important course to have,” said Valentina I. Perez ’15, who is currently taking the class.
Although Schlozman’s research has focused more on participatory inequalities of American politics, her broad repertoire of teaching experience and knowledge of Harvard made her a perfect fit.
“There is nobody really on the [Harvard] faculty who can [teach this class],” said Schlozman, who has taught the same class at Boston College.
While the student movement cited a significant demand for the class, only 14 students—all of whom are female—enrolled in Government 1545 this fall. As a result, Schlozman adapted the class from a lecture format to a more discussion-oriented experience.
Schlozman said that the absence of men in her course is not particularly problematic. “There are clearly women who find it a home for intellectual questions that are not getting answered elsewhere,” she said.
Perez echoed Schlozman’s sentiment, adding that Harvard still has room to grow in terms of exploring the relationship between gender and politics. To her, Schlozman’s class is a step in the right direction.
Perez said that Schlozman always ties class discussions back to Harvard, which makes the discussions relatable.
Despite the fact that Schlozman is a visiting professor, Perez said “she has an understanding of what goes on at Harvard” which has added to the experience of the class.
FROM MENTEE TO MENTOR
As a student at Wellesley College in the 1960’s, Schlozman once played former leader of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev in a cold war simulation. Across the table sat a young Hillary Rodham, playing the role of Mao Zedong, according to Schlozman’s son, Daniel.
Schlozman, who described herself as “a child of the [Chicago] suburbs,” said that Wellesley was the springboard for her academic career.
After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley in 1968 with a degree in Sociology, Schlozman enrolled at the University of Chicago, where she began her doctoral work in political science.
Professor emeritus Sidney Verba, former head of Harvard’s Government department who was an assistant professor at UChicago at the time, served as Schlozman’s dissertation advisor. The two followed separate paths to Boston, where they maintained a longstanding collaboration that has produced numerous articles and four books over the years, according to Verba.
Most recently, the pair published “The Unheavenly Chorus: Unequal Political Voice and the Broken Promise of American Democracy” with Henry E. Brady, Dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley. The 728-page book, which Schlozman called a “big, red doorstop,” is the most exhaustive examination of participatory inequality published yet, she said.
Just as Verba mentored Schlozman at the UChicago, Schlozman personally mentors a number of Boston College students, even this year as she maintains her full-time job at Harvard. Schlozman said that she has spent a great deal of time this fall writing letters of recommendation and advising students considering graduate school.
“One is hardly aware of her absence,” said Susan M. Shell, the chair of the political science department at Boston College.
AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER
At Boston College, Schlozman has been a “seminal force” in creating innovative teaching methods and researching prolifically, Shell said.
During her time at Boston College, Schlozman developed a sophomore tutorial program that won the Rowan and Littlefield Award in Innovative Teaching from the American Political Science Association.
“She’s a very significant figure [at Boston College],” said Verba, who described Schlozman as a leader in her field and a “superstar” in Boston College’s political science department.
Schlozman’s notable career has been characterized by her research regarding the inequalities of America’s political system.
“Her motivation is a civic one,” said Verba, who pointed to Schlozman as an academic who, without sacrificing objectivity, has contributed to the betterment of society.
Schlozman has moved through her career with “a commitment to understanding the way inequalities affect American life,” said her son Daniel, who is currently an assistant professor of American politics at Johns Hopkins University.
“She always gives 120 percent,” said Shell, who has worked with Schlozman on various administrative tasks at Boston College. In addition to her work ethic, Shell praised Schlozman’s “extremely gracious and cooperative” attitude.
While her professional life is filled with accomplishments, her daughter, Julia, described her as a mother who loved two things: reading the New York Times and cooking.
“The only books of hers that I’ve read have been her two compilations of family recipes,” said Julia, with a laugh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether they are working in the library, in cafes, or even with mops in strangers’ bathrooms, more than 65 percent of Harvard undergraduates are student employees—balancing academics, extracurriculars, and the additional responsibility of term-time employment.
Student-employment is a diverse and rich experience that, despite its challenges, offers both a paycheck and life skills. With positions ranging from a part-time bathroom custodian to the president of a multimillion-dollar company, student employees take away much more from their job than an estimated average pay of $11.50 an hour. Many students said that the experience in the workplace provides a crucial connection between the classroom and the real world, preparing them for life after college. 
GETTING PAID 
It may come as no surprise that most student-employees are primarily concerned with cold, hard cash. Office of Career Services Director Robin Mount said that most Harvard students who work during the academic year do so to earn money. Still, in recent years the increase in Harvard financial aid has led to a shift in the specific financial reasons students continue to sign up for work. 
Harvard Student Agencies President Patrick S. Coats ’14 noted that many HSA student employees are using their paychecks differently than they did in the past. 
“HSA was paying tuition 20 years ago,” he said. Today, many students use their paychecks for personal spending money. 
Meg B. Swift ’93, the director of stu- dent employment, sees this as a positive trend. 
“We’d love it if your job during term time pays for your trip to Pinocchio’s rather than billed expenses”, Swift said. 
According to Swift, upperclassmen who receive financial aid are expected to contribute around $3,500 per year towards their billed expenses, which include tuition, books, and travel expenses. James R. M. Watkins ’16, for instance, said he has his job at the Lamont circulation desk as part of his financial aid plan but his paycheck is for “snacks and weekend spending money.”
Student employment can be a good way to keep the mini-fridge stocked. The limits for the Federal Work Study Program are $9.50-12.50 an hour, with some other jobs—both on and off-campus—paying even more, Swift said. 
“On-campus jobs pay really well compared to jobs I’ve had in the past,” said Claire B. Fitzgerald ’14, an employee at Lamont Café.
OUTSIDE BENEFITS 
While money is often cited as the reason for having term-time employment, student employees said that there are many other benefits. These range from learning responsibility to building self-esteem, Coats said. 
“Managing work on top of school is definitely a useful thing to know how to do,” Fitzgerald said. 
In fact, employers highly value these skills in the workforce, according to Mount. 
“You definitely need to pick up work experience, whether it’s term-time or summer, unless you’re going to graduate school,” Mount said. “It doesn’t need to be paid, but in this competitive economy most employers really don’t want to teach you how to get up on time.” 
Other students said that the benefits of working extend beyond professional benefits. Some said they find their jobs relaxing and enjoyable. For Tara Dankel, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the general manager of Café Gato Rojo, work offers a break from academic life.
“It’s a great counterbalance to school because it’s so social, and if there’s a problem I fix it, whereas the rest of the time I’m in the library,” she said. 
Student managers also expressed enthusiasm about spending so much time at work. According to Alec D. Yeh ’14, the assistant manager at Cafe Gato Rojo, one of the best parts of his job has been the chance to be part of “a social space that’s so accepting, especially on a campus where we value exclusivity.” 
Examples of the café’s willingness to mix individual interests with work include an employee-led push to stock local honey and the recent themed “drag day” at the cafe, which included costumed baristas. 
Students are equally enthused by more professional aspects of their jobs. For Coats, as president of a company with a multimillion-dollar budget, the future job opportunities and alumni connections have been extremely valu- able parts of his experience. 
“It’s really cool to have an endowment, a board of directors, and four spaces in Harvard square,” Coats added. 
JOB HAZARDS 
Despite all of the benefits of working a term time job, it also comes with many downsides. 
“Time is Harvard students’ most precious commodity,” Mount said. Others echoed her sentiment. 
According to Fitzgerald, balancing academics and employment can detract from her attention in either area. “There have been times where I wish I could work a little harder on a paper or study more for a midterm, but I had to be at work. It’s the same on the other side,” she said, adding that academics has interfered with her ability to focus completely on her job. 
In addition to time management, there are other challenges that come with being invested in a job. For Coats, being a student manager in charge of about 500 employees comes with its share of stress. He and Yeh both said that there are unique challenges to dealing authoritatively with one’s peers.
Each place of employment has its unique set of challenges, especially when it comes to hiring. According to Yeh, students often come in with a lack of work experience. “We [as students] focused a lot on school when we were in high school,” he said. “It’s a steep learning curve learning how to work in customer service.”
At Café Gato Rojo, the constraints imposed by the Federal Work Study Program are also a source of frustration. The federal government is responsible for approximately 50 percent of student wages at the cafe, which helps keep costs down but also limits the applicant pool to a specific income bracket.
“It’s really negative for us because we spend a lot of time and resources training people and then they lose their work-study [eligibility],” Dankel said. 
Gato can only hire work-study employees, and with Harvard’s updated financial aid program, Dankel noted difficulty in finding enough work-study eligible employees to hire.
Watkins also noted the difficulty in scheduling work shifts in advance. “Because student plans are always changing, it’s tough locking down a compatible shift,” he said. Whether a student spends two or 25 hours working, employment does necessitate a certain time commitment.

Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister surprised students yesterday with another email in their inboxes—this time telling them that they looked like they could “Use A Cupcake”—and that same day, an anonymous samaritan publicly celebrated the dean’s quirkiness by creating a Facebook fan page in his honor.
 
According to the description of the page—which is aptly titled “Dean Pfister”—it exists to celebrate “the words, wisdom, and fungal knowledge of our well-loved interim Dean of the College.” So far, over 90 “Pfister Pfans” (check out the page’s URL) have liked the page. 
The Facebook page’s first post references Pfister’s Thursday email to undergraduates—one of several this semester. Some of Flyby’s favorite musings from the dean’s emails include mystery novel recommendations, descriptions of Harvard trees, and most recently, allusions to the possibility of his distributing cupcakes as a reading period snack.

UPDATED: Saturday, Dec. 7, 2013 at 4:56 p.m.
The end of the semester is a stressful time, and we all need to remember to relax every now and then. Flyby is here to help! This is the second installment in our Seven Days of Reading Period series, inspired by "The Twelve Days of Christmas." Stay tuned for more!
On the (evening of the) second day of reading period, Flyby gave to me two poignant reminders that college isn't everything and finals aren't the end of the world.
First, in the wise words of Beyoncé, "Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?"
Secondly, if ruminating about your GPA is getting you down, just think about Ellen DeGeneres. The world-famous comedian dropped out of college, and as she told the audience in her 2009 Tulane University commencement address, "I'm not saying you wasted your time or money, but look at me, I'm a huge celebrity."
IN DEBT? NOT FOR PRINCETON. As it turns out, student debt varies drastically depending on a student's state and university. (Delaware is the state with the highest student debt in the whole country.) A report published this week by the Institute of College Access and Success names Princeton, California State University-Sacramento, and Howard University as three of the twenty schools with the lowest student debt after graduation. Schools like Kentucky State University and Trinity University were listed as "high debt" schools.
CATCHING FIRE. Are the odds really in your favor? The Los Angeles Times reports a smaller number of expected high school graduates nationwide, meaning better chances of getting into college due to a smaller applicant pool. The catch? Highly selective schools such as Harvard will probably not see a dip in applicant numbers.
NEW SAT GETS DELAYED. The new SAT test won't be debuting until 2016, a full year later than planned.
