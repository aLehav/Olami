After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who left their jobs, rearranged their schedules, and even sold their cars to pay for an education at Bay State College in Back Bay, Boston, will now have done it all for naught.
Last week, the New England Commission of Higher Education rejected an appeal of an earlier January decision to strip the for-profit school of its accreditation. Beginning August 31, Bay State students will lose access to federal financial aid funds; their credits may not be transferable to other institutions.
Featuring errant charges of up to $2,000 on tuition bills, last-minute cancellations of the programs that motivated students to apply, and an inability to meet commission standards on institutional resources and organization, Bay State appears to have entirely failed to fulfill its promise of a quality education that prepares its students for the professional world.
While the commission’s denial may come as unwelcome news for the school’s administration, it is undoubtedly the students who will get the short end of the stick. This decision may spell the end of the pursuit of higher education or the need to monumentally restructure career plans for these students, as they struggle to find alternate schools that will accept their credits and the resources to finance their transfers.
These are also broadly students for which the transfer journey is already onerous. As of 2016, 75 percent of undergraduates at for-profit colleges were below middle-income. In addition, many of these students are on non-traditional paths; they go to great lengths to attend their schools, often banking on the promise of bolstered expected earnings post-graduation.
For-profit colleges are often considered the most viable options by students making difficult decisions at the crossroads of educational and professional development. Educational disruptions due to non-transferrable credits set students back not only financially, but also personally — in their life plans, hopes, and dreams.
Given estimates that at least 70 percent of revenue at all for-profit colleges comes from federal sources — which includes taxpayer money — the actions of for-profit colleges must not go unchecked. Highly regulated review processes are prudent to hold these often exploitative institutions accountable.
When for-profit schools risk losing accreditation, the highest priority is ensuring that students are able to continue with their education. Warnings must be given as early as possible. As soon as for-profit colleges are even placed on probation, students — current, former, and future — must be informed, so that they have ample time to navigate their alternatives. Schools should only operate as long as their students have the ability to transfer out, and government officials should design specific policies to ensure that such transfer processes are straightforward and painless.
We are glad that Bay State quickly informed students of the initial de-accreditation decision and their plans to develop degree completion or transfer plans for those impacted by program changes following the first commission decision in January. But that still wasn’t enough time for students to truly sort out their transfers, especially since student testimony suggests this transfer advising was practically nonexistent. Bay State is responsible for directly overseeing smooth transfers for its soon-to-be former students, as initially promised.
In considering their options, community college offers a suitable alternative to many of the students whose non-traditional education paths have attracted them to for-profit colleges. As we have previously written, community college is an underutilized, cost-effective, quality educational system — without many of the security flaws of for-profit institutions.
But most materially, for-profit colleges like Bay State that lose their accreditation must reimburse students for non-transferable credits. For all that Bay State has put their students through over the past year, it must pay them back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Kurds in the homeland and diaspora, the scent of apples is one that, especially during the month of March, revives scars from the past. For those of us who grew up hearing stories about the Halabja Massacre of March 16, 1988, we are familiar with the narrative of late dictator Saddam Hussein’s use of chemical weapons, which smelled strongly of sweet apples, to gas this Kurdish city, ultimately claiming the lives of 5,000 people.
2023 marks 35 years since the deadly attack on the city, yet the lasting implications of the attack are still affecting Kurds across the world. Many survivors and their children deal with both psychological and physical consequences, such as respiratory illnesses. Moreover, the denial of the massacre, the continued idealization of Ba’athism (the political ideology of Saddam Hussein and Bashar al-Assad of Syria), and the persistent occupation of Kurdistan are all alive and rampant in the Middle East and in diasporic communities.
As a student of Kurdish and Syrian-Arab heritage, I have grappled with the reality of these two conflicting identities for years. In Arab spaces especially, I have tried to amplify the stories of Kurdistan as much as possible. While there are many in my community who have expressed support and advocated for Kurdistan, I have noticed the lasting effects of bigotry and tribalism still taking place in our own campus spaces. Whether defending songs that mourn Saddam Hussein, chanting the Farsi translation of “jin, jiyan, azadi” without crediting its Kurdish origin, or claiming that a Kurdish state will only cause chaos in the Middle East, many on campus have reminded me that being Kurdish in diaspora does not make me immune to the erasure and oppression people in Kurdistan face.
Many who praise Saddam Hussein as an “anti-imperialist,” pro-unity leader forget that the attack on Halabja was not possible without the help of Western forces including the United States. CIA files prove that the United States gave military and monetary aid to Saddam Hussein the same year he committed the attack against Halabja. Yet there are always excuses to back the oppressive dictator despite the Anfal Campaign, his genocide against the Kurds of modern-day northern Iraq.
There is a famous Kurdish proverb that goes, “We have no friends but the mountains.” This phrase has always been symbolic of the repeated neglect and abandonment of Kurds by other communities in the midst of their oppression. The mountains have always been a place of refuge for Kurds — much unlike their neighbors — concealing them from the armies and fighters who work to ethnically cleanse Kurdish cities, towns, and villages.
Remembering my mother’s stories of childhood under the Saddam Hussein regime in Halabja, I am filled with anger each time I hear someone claiming Saddam Hussein was a good leader “besides the Kurdish issue.” I, along with the millions of other Kurds across the world, am tired of having our stories brushed off to the side. There should be no “besides.” Occupation does not vanish our population; it does not erase our stories, our culture, or our language. Our land.
Occupation does not erase Kurdistan.
This is why we continue to speak. Because attempts at ethnically cleansing Kurds still persist today.
Just a few weeks ago, on Kurdish Clothing Day, Iraqi forces guarding the entrance to a university in the disputed city of Kirkuk denied entry to Kurds wearing traditional clothing. Kirkuk, an oil-rich city, has been subjected to land grabs by the Iraqi government as well as an Arabization campaign with roots in the Saddam Hussein regime.
Around the same time, on March 20, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (formerly known as the “Free Syrian Army”) shot and killed four members of a Kurdish family celebrating Newroz, the new year and spring solstice.
These are just a few of the many attacks on Kurdish people under their occupying states. From Rojava (“Syrian” Kurdistan) to Rojhelat (“Iranian” Kurdistan), the occupation poisons Kurdish society the same way Saddam poisoned Halabja. History is repeating itself through the erasure, gaslighting, and silencing of Kurdish people in the diaspora. I have seen this in my own experiences on campus, a disheartening example of how harmful ideologies like pan-Arabism and Ba’athism have left a lasting impression on both diasporic and homeland communities.
But despite the displacement of our people and the dispossession of our land, we still resist. We celebrate Newroz in our vibrant traditional clothing and dance the halparke. We yell “jin, jiyan, azadi” even when our occupiers try to take this phrase away from us. We raise our Kurdish flag higher and higher, we preserve our mountains to reaffirm our connection to our lands, and we tell the stories of our people. We say we are Kurdish — not Iraqi, Syrian, Turkish, or Iranian.
Our freedom rests on the preservation of our cultures, the rise against our occupying powers, and the storytelling of our past. I truly believe that one day, we will no longer be silenced, but liberated. One day, it will no longer be considered “divisive” or “provocative” for me to say that I am both Kurdish and Arab. One day, others will see that my two ethnic identities do not oppose each other, but work to uplift one another.
I know that soon, others around the world who work to understand Kurdistan’s history and reality will join the mountains in supporting us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lemme tell a story
You’ve probably heard a lot.
About a needy Harvard kid
Whose family owns a yacht.

Mommy is a lawyer.
Daddy’s got a Ph.D.
They paid for cello lessons
Ever since their kid was three.

His parents own two houses.
They vacation near and far.
And once he learned to drive
Of course, his folks bought him a car.

Now, if you called this student rich,
He’d say that wasn’t true.
Admitting he’s well off, it seems,
Is something he can’t do.

Sure, his family income
Has more digits than your hand,
But if you call him privileged,
he’ll say, “You don’t understand.

My parents aren’t CEO’s
They aren’t billionaires.
I’m simply ‘Harvard middle class.’
I’m not like other heirs!”

If you pushed the matter,
He might then push back and list
All the ways his life was rough
that you seem to have missed.

Sure he went to Europe,
But, like, only once or twice!
He always had to wait to buy
the newest smart device.

Though he went to private school
It wasn’t, like, the best
For only half the students there
Got 5’s on AP tests.

Though he has some money
Surely, other kids have more.
“And that is why,” he says,
“By Harvard standards, I am poor!”

Clearly, you and I can see
Straight through this phony show.
‘Cause not owning a mansion
Doesn’t mean you don’t have dough.

And yet so many students here,
Whose parents make a lot,
When asked if they have money,
Try to act like they do not.

It speaks to the phenomena
That happens at this school,
Where privileged Harvard students
Think that being poor is cool.

They’ll start with off-hand comments like,
“Oh God, I’m like, so poor.”
Then, they’ll buy their daily latte
From the coffee store.

Come time for summer rent
They’re like, “I can’t afford it, see?”
Despite the fact their parents
Pay their rent in NYC.

And in a weird attempt to seem
Less stuck up or less snobby
They’ll get a campus job
That’s really more a campus hobby.

‘Cause if things really did get tight
Their folks could bail them out.
They’ve got a solid safety net
So they won’t go without.
Yet, still, they try to minimize
The role that privilege played
In getting them to where they are…
It’s like they are afraid.
Like, if they were to say that, yes,
Their family has dollars,
Then all their peers would question
Their ability as scholars.
And so, to best preserve
This shaky meritocracy
Many will remove themselves
From aristocracy.

Alone, they’ll moan and groan with you.
They’ll gossip, and they’ll scoff,
“Kids here are so rich and stuff.
They’re all, like, so well off.”
But rarely will they take a pause
To think ‘bout where they are,
And how their financial safety net
Has let them get this far.
And if you ask their income
It will be at your expense
For such a blatant question
Is offensive to their cents.

“Sure, my parents have some dough,
But that’s not mine, it’s theirs.
Right now, I’m like, so poor
That I can’t even buy new shares!”
“Ugh, it’s so expensive.”
“Guys I’m like, sooo broke.”
“I’m just a college student
And my bank account’s a joke.”

It seems that many Harvard folks
Are filled with endless dread
At the prospect of admitting
Money helped them get ahead.

I’m not just talking ‘bout the kids
Of billionaire descent.
(Though over half of y’all
Come from the top 20 percent)—

But also all those Harvard folks
Of upper-middle class
Who fail to see the privileges
That helped them to surpass.
Cause what these students fail to see
and others just ignore, is that
Being upper-middle class
Does not mean you are poor.
The average Harvard income
Is like, far above the norm
And financial stability
Can help kids to perform.
But mostly, folks, this fake
“I’m poor” act that you’ve been deploying?
I’m here to tell you all that
It is, frankly, quite annoying.
Although I am low-income,
I’ve still got some lucky stuff.
My parents own a home
Where I can go if things get rough.
But real financial struggles
Aren’t trendy, hip, or cool
And very few of us actually
Feel them at this school.
So yeah, this was my PSA.
Y'all, please, hear what I’m saying.
Stop acting like you’re poor.
We know you’re not, so quit your playing.

Harvard students and affiliates chased each other around the Quad Lawn while throwing colored powder and spraying water guns on Sunday afternoon to celebrate Holi, the Hindu Festival of Colors.
Holi is an Indian celebration of spring where participants douse each other with vibrant colors. Dharma, Harvard’s Hindu Student Association, hosts an annual Holi celebration — usually on the Quad Lawn.
Suhanee S. Mitragotri ’25, co-president of Dharma, described Holi as an important tradition to Hindu culture and religion.
“It’s something that brings the Dharma community together,” she said. “Harvard Dharma arranged this every year — it’s a tradition, so we’re really excited to be able to do it again for another year and be able to celebrate together.”
Dharma Junior Treasurer Pranav Ramesh ’26 added that in addition to bringing the Dharma community together, the organizers wanted Holi to be “inclusive and diverse.”
“So many people came for this event — those in the Dharma community and those not in the community,” Ramesh said. “We wanted to make sure that this is an event that is open to everyone, and it was and we’re glad that everyone had a lot of fun here.”
Ramesh said one of the main goals of holding Holi on campus was to educate students and affiliates on the meaning and significance of the festival. He described Holi as a celebration of “lights,” “color,” and “success,” as well as an opportunity to spend time with friends and form new relationships.
Aditi Raju ’25 said that she went to Dharma’s Holi celebration last year, but she arrived too late and the colored powder had already run out.
“Despite being Indian myself, I’ve never been to an actual Holi celebration,” she said. “I really wanted to go this year, so I got there early. It’s really fun — it’s a celebration of spring.”
Raju and Jared Ni ’25, who attended the celebration together, said their favorite part was throwing colors because it was a “nice stress relief.” They described the celebration as “fun,” “vibrant,” and “colorful.”
Lowell Resident Tutors Francisco J. Marmolejo Cossío ’12 and Rhea Tibrewala said they heard about the Holi celebration from a group of Desi students in Lowell.
“They told us it’s gonna be a good time, and they know I [am] constantly missing India,” Tibrewala said.
“It’s such a nice sense of community for many of the students who I was talking to who have not celebrated Holi in so long,” she added. “It’s just a good space for everyone and very respectful — which is not always the case with Holi.”
Attendee Ammaar A. Saeed ’23 said the celebration was “full of energy” and “a little bit crazy,” but still “a great time.”
“I think it’s a great cultural celebration,” Saeed said. “I’m not Hindu myself or any of the Sikh-identifying religions that celebrate Holi, but it’s a good way to connect with those friends and connect with the culture they grew up with.”
Saeed added that attendees needed to “be ready” and “primed” for the “aggression” at the celebration.
“It’s a very forward exchange culturally, so people you know or just barely know throw the powder in your face or shoot you with water,” he said. “You have to be ready for that stepping in.”
“This is actually one of the best experiences I’ve had so far here — everyone is pouring powder on each other, just laughing, having a fun time, playing good music,” Ramesh said. “I think this was a successful event.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even the Belarusian opposition believes Belarus should not be the current geopolitical focus for the European Union and the United States.
“The focus now is on Ukraine,” Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya unequivocally stated at the Harvard Kennedy School on Friday. “And we fully support this because Ukrainians now are fighting, defending not only their lands, they’re defending the principles of democracy, common values.”
More than a year after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a massive escalation in a conflict that dates back to 2014, Tsikhanouskaya and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola reaffirmed that their support for Ukraine has not waned during a joint appearance at the Friday forum.
The forum was co-sponsored by the Harvard Institute of Politics and the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies as part of the University’s student-led European Conference.
Tsikhanouskaya ran against Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in an August 2020 election that handed Lukashenko a sixth term in office. The election was widely regarded as fraudulent, and hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets to protest the results.
Exiled after the election, Tsikhanouskaya traveled to Brussels and Washington to galvanize support for the democratic movement in Belarus. However, the escalation of the war in Ukraine shifted the world’s attention to Belarus’ Eastern European neighbor.
At the forum, Metsola said EU leaders have not allowed domestic crises to distract them from providing aid to Ukraine.
Tsikhanouskaya said Belarusians and Ukrainians are united in their desire to escape Russia’s influence and join the EU.
“No matter how the war ends, Russia will come out weak out of it: militarily, economically, politically, and with no allies,” Tsikhanouskaya said.
“This provides us with a unique historical opportunity to get Belarus out of the Russian orbit,” she added. “There was no better way to convince Belarusians of the benefits of Europe than Russia launching a despicable war against our friend.”
Tsikhanouskaya, however, did not mention the tense relationship between the Belarusian opposition and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration, despite their mutual enemy in Russia.
Ukraine has yet to establish diplomatic or political relations with the Belarusian opposition movement.
Tsikhanouskaya said in an interview after the forum that she believes the Ukrainian government and the Belarusian opposition should be allies, but she added that she also understands Kyiv’s fear of provoking Lukashenko.
She added that her message to Ukraine is “you can ignore us, but as a nation it’s our moral obligation and actually necessity to support you because we understand that we are facing the same enemy.”
“We will support Ukrainians [in the] Ukrainian fight despite the presence or absence of political dialogue,” she said.
During the forum, Metsola took aim at those who have criticized the EU and the U.S. for providing military and financial aid to Ukraine over the course of the war.
“There are those who question the involvement of the European Union, and the United States for that matter,” Metsola said. “Those who prefer to pretend that what is happening in Ukraine is not real or who seek to excuse war crimes and breaches of international law; those who prefer the simplicity of propaganda to the stark reality of war; those who think they are too far away to care.”
“To those, I say the price of liberty is not too high.”
Metsola also reflected on the start of her political career when she campaigned for Malta to join the EU as a student activist.
“It was a very hard fought campaign, but I believed passionately then that my generation’s place was in Europe,” she said. “That is something I believe, still.”
Metsola said the European dream continues to serve as a guiding light for people in Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine, and other countries that aspire to join the EU.
“We must understand that for millions the concept of Europe is everything. It’s not just a destination. It is a way of life and a way of living,” she said. “It is a sometimes lonely light that defends liberal democracies, free markets, social safety nets, and personal freedoms.”

Two Harvard Graduate School of Education professors were earlier this month elected as members of the National Academy of Education, a nonprofit that aims to improve education policy and practice.
Heather C. Hill, professor in Teacher Learning and Practice, and Fernando M. Reimers, professor of the practice in International Education, were selected alongside 16 other education experts to join the academy on March 10. New members are chosen for their contributions of research critical to the development of improving education in the United States and globally.
Hill, who is also the faculty co-chair of the Graduate School of Education’s Teaching and Teacher Leadership program, researches strategies to improve professional development programs for math teachers. Hill said her interest in the field began during her graduate studies at the University of Michigan.
“I remember watching some teacher professional development going on and thinking ‘Oh my heavens, this seems like a waste of teachers’ time,’” Hill said.
“The evaluations that were taking place — this was back in the mid-90s — mainly just asked teachers whether they liked it or not and looked for impacts on their teaching, didn’t look for impacts on their students,” she added.
Hill went on to develop and popularize a measure of content knowledge for math teachers.
In addition to measuring content knowledge, Hill also created a measure of teacher instruction known as the Mathematical Quality of Instruction. Hill’s recent research has shown focusing on improving instructional quality has greater impacts on student achievement than boosting teacher content knowledge alone.
Still, Hill said it is important to recognize that progress in education is often “incremental.”
“Teachers are learning if you have a new professional development program or a new curriculum that you’re using, you don’t change completely what you’re doing in a year,” Hill said. “You get better and better at it.”
Reimers, who is from Venezuela, teaches courses on education innovation and policy analysis through a comparative global lens. Reimers said his style of teaching has changed since he started as a teaching fellow at the Graduate School of Education in 1986.
“I used to teach in a much more conventional way,” Reimers said. “I was teaching my students to contemplate problems and to obsess over problems as if they were not part of the problem — as if they could view them the way you view a movie.”
“I’m done with contemplating problems and not seeing yourself as part of the solution,” he added.
Reimers said he is particularly interested in research and teaching around the use of education to build global citizens.
“We should be asking ourselves, ‘How do we get education systems that teach people the skills they need to be full humans, to be members of communities, to treat other people in a manner that is respectful, dignified, open-minded, empathetic?’” Reimers said.
Reimers said his research is aimed away from the traditional quantitative methods used in many existing research efforts.
“People are totally fixated in quantifying whether the learning loss is a third of a standard deviation or a fifth of a standard deviation or half a standard deviation — I mean really, total bullshit,” Reimers said. “What is really important in my view is to figure out, ‘What is it that students should be learning to produce a better world? What are the skills they need?'”
“The goal of education should be to prepare us to find our humanity in others, even though they may look different, they may be different,” he added.

Harvard’s Dean of Social Sciences Lawrence D. Bobo said he does not want to succeed University President-Elect Claudine Gay as the next dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, but added that he believes the next dean should come from the University’s own ranks.
“I’m not sure everyone wants to hunt down a job like that, but it’s a relatively demanding perch,” Bobo said in a Wednesday interview. “As I looked at the challenges that Dean Gay has faced, I’ve often said to myself, ‘Oh, my god, thank goodness, I don’t have that job.’ I have a lot of things on my desk.”
Bobo added that his “commitment” lies with cultivating the social sciences at Harvard.
“I’m passionate about the social sciences and what they mean here at Harvard, and for society at large, and so I really do love being a part of keeping this unit at a level of excellence that we can all look at with pride,” he said.
Harvard officially launched the search for the next FAS dean in early February. When asked about possible contenders for the next FAS dean, Bobo said he doesn’t know whether the search committee had begun identifying contenders.
“I don't know that their discussions are at that stage. They may be, but I would doubt it,” he said.
Bobo said the next FAS dean should be someone who “really fits in with how the place is accustomed to running and its culture and knows all the personalities.”
“I would hope they lean toward an insider. I think Harvard has a very distinctive culture,” he said.
As the FAS undergoes a change in leadership, Bobo pointed to a number of initiatives that Gay’s successor will need to marshal, including ethnic studies, hiring “young, underrepresented minority scholars,” and strategic planning.
“It’s too early to say that we’re done in the arena of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration. There's still work to be done there,” he said.
During Wednesday’s interview, Bobo further discussed updates to the Social Sciences strategic planning process.
As part of the three-year FAS strategic planning process that launched in October 2021, the Social Sciences strategic planning process aims to align the division’s centers and departments with “the core research and teaching mission of the FAS,” according to the initiative’s website.
One result of the process so far is a more systematic tracking of faculty commitments, which has helped with “a greater degree of equity and the distribution of all of those roles and duties and modes of contributing to the broader life of the University,” according to Bobo.
Bobo also mentioned that faculty members often aren’t aware of the resources and opportunities at research centers. Another goal of the process is to ensure graduate and undergraduate students are aware of the resources available to them at research centers.
In addition, Bobo said center members would like to have input in the hiring process of departments, which has been “kind of on paper and not so much in practice.”
This has become a source of concern for core disciplines in particular, such as Economics and Government, as more scholars shift away from focusing on a sole area of expertise.
“You don’t come into economics anymore as an Africanist. You come in as a development economist, but we have an African center that needs a pipeline — potential faculty leadership,” Bobo said.

Parents and families of the Harvard College Class of 2024 flocked to Cambridge this weekend for their first official invitation to campus after the class’ freshman family weekend was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The weekend, hosted by the Harvard Dean of Students Office, offered programming including open houses, lectures, a group run around campus, and tours of Harvard museums, libraries, and residential houses.
Harvard administrators — including outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow, College Dean Rakesh Khurana, and University Marshal Katherine G. O’Dair — addressed families at events centered around student life, Commencement, and careers after graduation.
Though Jaya J. Nayar ’24 approved of Harvard’s decision to cancel the weekend in 2021, she said “it did suck” to miss out on certain traditions due to the pandemic, including a typical freshman family weekend and orientation.
“It is weird to be in my junior year and introducing my parents formally to Harvard for the first time,” Nayar said.
Rodger J. Allen, parent of Anika B. Allen ’24, said his family had a similar experience.
“We would have been discovering all this at the same time, but now she’s able to almost guide for us and show us where everything is,” he said. “We were excited to see what she’s been talking about all this time.”
Yanni M. Raymond ’24 said the lost time was a common topic of conversation during the weekend.
“We’re all talking about how we feel like we missed out a lot on that year, so it’s nice to have this time now,” he said.
Each of the 12 undergraduate houses invited juniors and their families to Friday evening receptions, which included building tours and refreshments.
Brammy Rajakumar ’23, who led tours of Lowell House, said she was excited to see an increase in turnout compared to the junior family weekend, hosted last spring for the Class of 2023.
“I think a lot more people were able to come because it’s not too pandemic-y,” she said. “It’s just so exciting.”
Families were also invited to the Harvard Foundation Intercultural and Race Relations’ Cultural Rhythms Food Festival and Artist of the Year Conversation, which featured actress, writer, and producer Issa Rae. The weekend also coincided with student-run shows, including the Harvard Expressions Dance Company’s Spring showcase.
Aseelah Ashraf ’24 said she was delighted to reunite with her family, who had traveled from Springfield, Ohio, for the festivities.
“It’s been great. I missed my parents a lot because I didn’t go home over spring break,” Ashraf said.
Ashraf’s mother, Ashra Ahmad, lauded the availability of engaging activities for younger family members.
“I took him to the museum,” Ahmad said, motioning to Ashraf’s younger brother. “If you have a younger sibling, I think it really works out because you could do something more exciting with them.”
Despite the weekend’s full slate of programming, many parents interviewed said they were most happy to simply observe their children’s daily experiences.
“I like seeing what our daughter is up to and everything that’s going on and meet the other parents and connect faces and names and gene pools,” said David R. McDonald.
“It was nice to see her in action,” Ahmad said of her daughter. “I know she walks a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society hosted a panel of journalists and activists for a conversation Thursday on gender-based harassment in journalism.
The virtual talk, titled “‘Weaponizing Misogyny’: Gender-Based Harassment’s Impact on Journalists and Free Expression,” featured Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz, Student Press Law Center board member Pratika Katiyar, PEN America Senior Manager for Free Expression and Digital Safety Jeje Mohamed, and International Women’s Media Foundation Executive Director Elisa Lees Muñoz.
Lorenz, a technology and online culture columnist who has attracted online backlash from right-wing social media accounts, spoke about her own experience with harassment. She said she receives death threats “every single day,” but added that she finds other forms of harassment even more harmful.
“What’s been really hard is what’s been happening to my family,” she said.
Lorenz said her sister faced accusations of grooming that resulted in calls to the police and Child Protective Services, while her parents have been “swatted” — the practice of reporting false threats to law enforcement to induce an emergency response.
“It’s kind of this halo effect where I feel like anybody associated with me gets targeted,” she said.
According to Lorenz, online harassment has also affected her career.
“I’ve lost a lot of professional opportunities. I’ve been disinvited from speaking events from going on podcasts and stuff because they don't want to deal with the backlash or they don’t feel like they have enough security for the event,” she said.
Muñoz said online harassment has negative effects on the mental health of reporters.
“There is research done on the impact on journalists and they exhibit and report having symptoms similar to PTSD as a result of these kinds of attacks and onslaughts,” she said. “So I think it’s really important not only to recognize that the threat does often move into the physical space, but that the impact even if it stays in the cyber world is the same.”
Katiyar, a sophomore and student journalist at Northeastern University, said Gen Z journalists who rely on social media for exposure face particular challenges. Katiyar said she can’t simply log off when facing harassment because life for her generation exists “in between off and online.”
“It’s easier said than done, to get offline or shrug it off,” she said. “There needs to be a better implementation of support within newsrooms, trainings to combat that because being offline is not always an option for a lot of young people.”
Mohamed said newsrooms should take steps toward addressing gender-based harassment, beginning with acknowledging the issue and checking in on those affected.
“If people feel that the newsroom considers online abuse as an actual threat and a problem, they will be more likely to talk and seek help if they need it,” Mohamed said.
Lorenz said support from peers can be another resource for journalists facing online harassment.
“I’m in a group chat with a lot of other female journalists who have encountered this type of stuff. We’re all tech reporters, women tech reporters, so we kind of get that and I think just having that peer-to-peer support is really great,” she said. “I wish it’s something that newsrooms would better facilitate.”
Muñoz called on newsrooms to acknowledge and address gender-based harassment.
“No journalists, women journalists, women journalists of color should have to endure what they are enduring every single day,” she said.
“We should all be accountable to making sure that news organizations, individuals, nonprofit organizations are addressing this because the consequences are very dire for our democracy,” Muñoz added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston-area commuters are facing a slew of new slowdowns and service disruptions on the T as a regular state inspection of the Red Line track in early March led to emergency system-wide speed restrictions.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has warned commuters of delays of up to 20 minutes on all metro lines due to ongoing inspections to verify the documentation of track defects and repairs. Speed restrictions will then remain in place on defective parts of the track until the sections are fixed or entirely replaced.
The T imposes speed restrictions of 10 to 25 miles per hour — creating what is often referred to as “slow zones” — to minimize damage to vulnerable stretches of track, whether because of defect, age, or weather conditions, according to the MBTA website.
“If you don’t catch the train that’s on its way, you have to wait at least 15, 20 minutes for the next one,” said Claire E. Myers, a Brandeis University student working at Clover in Harvard Square. Myers added she is often late for work due to the T.
According to the MBTA website — which recently launched a service for tracking slow zones by location, underlying cause, and distance — 172 speed restrictions have been opened over the last month. In total, 27 percent of all MBTA subway tracks are currently under a speed restriction, more than triple last month’s total.
“The dashboard delivers information that is clear and will assist riders in better understanding why they are experiencing slower conditions while riding the T,” said MBTA Interim General Manager Jeff Gonneville in a March 23 press release. “As we continue to validate and address track deficiencies, we also expect that over time, this platform will demonstrate the progress we’re making to remove speed restrictions.”
“We know these restrictions impact riders’ daily commutes and we will continue to be transparent about the ongoing, daily work to improve our transit system,” Gonneville added.
The new restrictions add to a deluge of disruptions and service changes faced by T riders since an investigation into the system was launched last May by the Federal Transit Administration. The FTA ultimately forced the T to form a plan to address findings that included overworked operators, high accident rates, and numerous other safety violations.
With the dramatic increase in slow zones across the metro system, riders have complained about delays in their commutes. The current total delay from slow zones on the Red Line is more than 30 times greater than it was one year ago, according to TransitMatters, a public transportation advocacy organization.
The MBTA has begun offering commuter rail as an alternative to some of its metro lines, including the Red, Orange, and Green lines. The ferry is also available as an alternative to the Blue Line.
“As we work to lift speed restrictions & plan repairs, we’re providing alternate transit options for all subway lines,” the MBTA tweeted on March 26.
Commuters are also dissatisfied with inconsistencies in the T’s running speed, as the landscape of slow zones changes near-constantly.
“Between Porter and Harvard, it can take anywhere from the normal two minutes to five, eight minutes,” Myers said. “That inconsistency is really an issue for me.”
This weekend, shuttle buses replaced train service on the Red Line from Harvard Station to JFK/UMass in a shutdown planned prior to the Department of Public Utilities’ site visit and subsequent speed restrictions.
The Red Line also received criticism over a falling ceiling panel that nearly struck a commuter earlier this month.
Seth Kaplan, a software engineer and volunteer at TransitMatters, said the T has become “exponentially worse” since 2022.
“The MBTA is in a crisis,” Kaplan said. “It’s just not functioning.”
“It’s been almost debilitating,” said Clyve Lawrence ’25, a Crimson Editorial editor who regularly takes the T.
Lawrence, who worked in Boston City Hall during the fall semester, said the delays are “frustrating” because they indicate a lack of attention from government officials.
“It shows transit isn’t a priority for our government,” he added.
As disruptions, accidents, and delays mount for riders, Kaplan said the effect is beyond a daily inconvenience.
“The MBTA and its leadership are failing the people of Boston,” he added.“It’s pushing people off the T and into cars, into Ubers, and it’s hard to gain those people back once you lose their trust.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some Harvard affiliates are disappointed by the lack of response from Harvard students to the killing of 20-year-old University of Massachusetts Boston student Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge Police Department officer.
Faisal, a Bangladeshi American resident of Cambridge, was shot and killed by Cambridge Police on Jan. 4 after he allegedly approached officers wielding a knife following a chase through Cambridge, according to a CPD press release.
The killing has sparked months of city-wide protest against alleged brutality and racism in Cambridge’s police and renewed calls for police reform in Cambridge. Though organizing by Boston-area students has been a large part of this push, several Harvard students said they feel their peers are not doing enough.
“From what I’ve seen, there hasn't been a huge response considering how big Harvard is on an international scale and how close Harvard is to the incident that occurred,” said Amari M. Butler ’25, who spoke during a Tuesday rally as city officials met with activists demanding “Justice for Faisal.”
In a statement Wednesday morning, City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 wrote that he and other city officials are committed to implementing reforms, including “a full review of policies, procedures, and training with independent experts, implementing body cameras, using alternative responses, assessing less-than-lethal options, developing a procedural justice dashboard, and strengthening the City’s mental health resources.”
Some Harvard students have urged their peers to turn out in numbers to show opposition to Cambridge Police.
“It is an act of police brutality — police violence — that happened in our community, that happened to a student that was of a racial minority. It checks all the boxes,” Shruti Gautam ’25 said. “I feel like that would cause an uproar on campus, and I have not seen anything like that at all.”
In a January statement, CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote that the officer who shot Faisal was a seven-year veteran with CPD and had never before received a complaint. The last fatal shooting by a Cambridge Police officer occurred in 2002, according to Warnick.
Faisal’s killing is currently under investigation by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office.
Harvard Yiddish preceptor Sara M. Feldman, who attended a January Harvard Square protest condemning the police shooting of Faisal, said Harvard affiliates “should be very, very concerned about this incident of murder,” and it is “in their own self-interest to be involved in this and to try to prevent the police from harming and killing more people in Cambridge.”
“I wish more people were turning out,” Feldman said, though she added that she was glad to see “solidarity” among the Cambridge residents who demonstrated.
Afiya Rahman ’24, who spoke at a Monday protest outside City Hall and wrote an op-ed in The Crimson calling upon South Asian students to support police abolition in Faisal’s wake, said in an interview that she was disappointed in the lack of organizing among Harvard students.
“I think a lot of times, the spaces at Harvard are very different and very disconnected from working class communities,” Rahman said. “This has been something that’s been overlooked.”
While speaking to protesters outside City Hall, Rahman directly addressed the lack of Harvard students present at the protest.
“It’s embarrassing that as Harvard students, a 10-minute walk away to City Hall is too much of a barrier for you all to be here,” she said Tuesday.
Gautam said she was motivated to join the protests over Faisal’s killing because of her shared identity with Faisal.
“This one specifically, I think just struck a chord not only because it was in the Massachusetts area, but also just because he was South Asian,” she said.
Rahman, a Crimson Editorial editor, said Faisal’s death “really affected me personally.”
“It happened in Cambridge and not far from MIT. He was 20-years-old, Bangladeshi college student, working class. I’m 20, an only child, working class, Bangladeshi,” Rahman said. “A lot of these things speak to my positionality.”
Gautam said she was frustrated with the lack of South Asian participation in recent organizing efforts. This lack of representation drove her interest in becoming involved in the protests.
“There was a disheartening amount of South Asians at the student organizing meeting,” she said. “There is definitely this mentality that these types of issues with the police do not affect Asian groups and South Asians.”
Rahman also said she was “disappointed in the reaction from South Asians on this campus because this is something that should personally speak to us,” adding that she has urged other South Asian students to attend demonstrations and sign petitions related to the protests against CPD.
Butler said students should embrace their role as part of Cambridge by participating in the protests.
“As Harvard students, we are Cambridge community members,” Butler said. “It’s important that we show up for issues that are beyond Harvard's campus borders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The home remodeling market increased to $567 billion in 2022, an estimated 15 percent increase from 2021, according to an annual housing report published Thursday by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Researchers attributed a surge in the home remodeling market in recent years in part to the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to an increased number of people working from home, precipitating a surge in spending on home improvement projects. As more people returned to work in 2022, the home remodeling market continued to see an increase in spending, but researchers expect home improvement and repair to slow in 2023.
Alongside the release of the 2023 report, the center hosted a webinar Thursday featuring a presentation from Abbe H. Will — a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies — followed by a panel discussion.
Thursday’s talk centered on trends related to home improvement projects and disaster reconstruction over the last two decades. Jane Dzielski, the principal analytical lead at Google, moderated the discussion with four panelists.
Between 2007 and 2021, the percentage of homeowner improvement budgets dedicated to exterior replacements increased by over 3 percent, while the percentage of systems and equipment replacements increased by more than 5 percent. In contrast, the percentage of room additions fell from 18.2 percent to 6.7 percent, more than an 11-percent drop.
The report also found that though lower-income homeowners spent less on repairing and improving their homes, these expenditures made up a larger proportion of their incomes. The homeowners in the lowest income quintile spent around $2,500 annually on average per owner, which represented 20.1 percent of their annual income. By contrast, those in the highest income quintile spent more than $9,000 annually on average per owner, which represented 6.4 percent of their annual income.
“Most of our lower-income homeowners and occupants are living in houses with such a greater energy burden that their resources are dwindling,” said Ruth Ann Norton, the president and CEO of Green & Healthy Homes Initiative.
In addition to lower-income homeowners, Norton said elderly people were also bearing the brunt of the burden of poor infrastructure.
The report also indicated that homeowners continued to spend a significant portion of their home improvement budgets on energy-related projects. Spending on such projects remained at less than 30 percent of total home improvement budgets but increased by 7 percent between 2009 and 2011 and has never dipped below 33 percent since.
At the end of Thursday’s webinar, panelists shared their optimism for America’s housing market.
Jessica A. Granderson ’97, the interim division director of the Building Technology & Urban Systems Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, said she was “much more naturally inclined to optimism,” adding that increasing homeownership among households of color are “foundational to wealth creation.”
Keith Rozolis, the president and CEO of ABC Supply, said he was “bullish” on the housing market due to the demographics of current and future homeowners.
According to Norton, the biggest opportunities in the future include changing “the moral compass on the condition of low-income housing in America.” To bolster the housing labor market, she also argued for the increased recruitment of people from low-income backgrounds into trade schools in the field.
Carlos Martín, the project director of the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies, agreed, arguing for the improvement of housing safety.
“I’d like to think that this pandemic gave us a chance to rethink both how our homes work for us and what we need to get, what kind of performance we actually want out of our housing,” Martín said.
