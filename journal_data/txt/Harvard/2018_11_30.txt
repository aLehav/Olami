After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a letter in Monday’s Harvard Law Record, a Harvard Law School student publication, 10 different Law School student affinity groups called on Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning to create a Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity. The groups seek to establish an office to deal with issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity that would act upon concerns raised by the committee. While we are supportive of these institutions, we cannot be certain the committee and office will be completely useful unless they are endowed with the resources and staffing they need to affect change.
A committee and office dealing with issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity would represent important steps in the right direction. At the same time, we hope the change these institutions ask for would be realistic. Otherwise, the committee and office run the risk of being ineffectual and irrelevant. There is a lot of change that must be implemented as soon as possible; a diversity, inclusivity, and equity office should come together and affect creative, practical, immediate solutions.
In setting up a committee and office focusing on these areas, we believe the Law School has a rare opportunity to build an institution on the strength of robust student interest. To do so, the school should incorporate student input and priorities about the shape and function of the committee and the office. To start with, the committee and office should not only consider the HLS student experience but also the advocacy that students may pursue with their law degree in the future.
We would also encourage those in charge of appointing members of the committee to cast wide nets in searching for students with a variety of ideas on how best to deal with issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. The committee will be at its strongest if its membership comes to the table with differing perspectives, as long as all students selected are deeply committed to the mission of the committee.
Beyond the specifics of suggestions for the committee, we would like to applaud the student groups for adopting this new communication strategy. The Law School has been far too slow in taking action with regard to these important issues. There have been few public signs that the school has implemented changes suggested by students in an addendum to a 2017 report from the Task Force on Academic Community and Student Engagement.
Though we have in the past discussed the misguided nature of some of the 2017 demands, we believe this letter offers a new avenue for progress in addressing students’ concerns reasonably and realistically. Thus, we commend students for showing willingness to engage in different kinds of dialogue. We call on Manning and the Law School to respond in the spirit of communication, even if it in disagreement. Finally, we appreciate that writing this letter may have been only the first step and that written communication is not the only valid or respectable form of pursuing change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Civics: “a social science dealing with the rights and duties of citizens.” Recently, legislation strengthening civics education in Massachusetts was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker. This legislation established a high school voter challenge program (akin to the University’s Harvard Votes Challenge), adds student-led civics projects to the curriculum, and outlines additional requirements for history and civics instruction.
Teaching civics and engaging students in the democratic process fuels a healthy democracy. And measures like this one should be implemented across the country, as they underpin the fundamental American value of an educated electorate. Without civics, we undervalue our rights, responsibilities, and role in society. After all, Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis did say that “the most important political office is that of the private citizen.” But in doing all of this, we must not forget the rest of the world.
In civics courses, students learn about other countries’ interactions with the United States, but often fail to dive deeper. Too often, students survive high school US history exams knowing only a few famous British names, that Nazis came from Germany, and something about President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, sitting with a Brit smoking a cigar and a mustached Russian. This is unacceptable. Students don’t need to memorize every form of government in existence. They should, however, have a basic understanding of the different ways people live and organize themselves across the world.
Throughout four years in my public high school in Massachusetts, a school and state each known for their quality of education, I cannot remember a single lesson devoted to India, the second-most populated country in the world. What happened in Mexico besides conquistadors killing Aztecs? Wait, you’re telling me there were civil wars all over Latin America? And what countries are included in Latin America anyway? These questions plagued me throughout high school. A global perspective contributes invaluably to the understanding of our contemporary political reality, domestic and international.
Let’s think about one of the issues discussed repeatedly on the news this past week: the so-called invasion of migrants. Yes, immigration reform deserves serious discussion in this country. But fleeing persecution and seeking asylum is not terrorism, as President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence’s racist implications suggest. Such demagoguery only works when we fail to teach our children about the current and historical situations of Latin American countries. And this phenomenon repeats itself for so many issues that have and will impact the world as we know it: Chancellor Merkel stepping out of the spotlight, the successes of nationalist leaders in Europe and Brazil, Vice President Pence’s Cold War-esque speech on China. The list goes on and on.
Without an increased focus — or any focus at all — on world history, our students will be missing out. Without any significant emphasis placed on learning about other countries, the people, or the cultures, American students cannot adequately place the US in a global context. No number of teachers or required classes can fit everything important about history. But until we increase the focus on world affairs in our schools, not only will we continue to ignore or misread situations like the migrant caravan or the fate of Europe, we will also fail to lead.
Leadership through diplomacy, empathy, and humility is hard to come by as it is. Of course, we should look for these in our representatives at home and abroad. But even moving into the private sector — technology, business, law — these skills remain critical. Conflict resolution isn’t unique to diplomacy.
With world history courses that can help build these qualities, students can fulfill their responsibility as global citizens and work to become the leaders of tomorrow. In a world of increasing globalization and impossibly fast innovation in technology, we are no longer responsible to our neighbors alone. Climate change will not stop itself, extreme poverty will not eradicate itself, and progress will not manifest itself.
Let’s expand our field of view from an electoral map of the United States to a globe with diverse people, thought, and history. It will help us at home, with our neighbors, in the workplace, and as a people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years ago, I had my very first American Thanksgiving Dinner in Newton, Mass. Relishing in the glory of finally being able to experience a Thanksgiving like the ones I’d seen in movies, I stuffed my face with turkey, pie, stuffing, mashed potatoes, popovers, and other all-American staples. Being raised in an immigrant household meant that my extended family lived an ocean away, and with no one to gather with, Thanksgiving break for us was just an extra long weekend during which we’d stay home, each in our own separate worlds with a book or a movie or a video game, in silence. I only came to know what a “real” Thanksgiving looked like during college through invitations from various friends. This year, however, I stayed on campus and Thanksgiving break became again an extra long weekend, spent mostly in silence.
Just like the old days, I picked up a book to escape into for the weekend. I’d been recommended Nawal El Saadawi’s memoirs’ by one of my professors during office hours and when he described her as a radical Egyptian feminist exiled from Egypt, I was immediately sold. For the weeks before break, I had been reading “A Daughter of Isis”, her first memoir, in the moments right before sleep. When the break came around, the quiet gave me the opportunity to explore her work beyond the first five pages that I found myself rereading while cocooned in my bed.
El Saadawi’s memoir was different than any other reading experience I’d ever had. This was my first dive into the literature of my family’s home-country and on these pages there was no need to draw parallels between my life and hers. Instead, our lives intersected at many key moments — from the food her family made to her reaction when she got her period to the dreams she had of fictitious lovers to her questions around her faith — her experiences were my own. For the first time I saw myself — my Egyptian self — on the printed page.
On every page was a key that unlocked some of my most distant memories from childhood. I could taste the ful she ate for breakfast each morning before she ran off to school — for her prepared from the green plant, for me prepared from the cans my family bought in bulk at our local Middle Eastern market. I could hear the azan that played for her from the minaret of the mosque in Alexandria and for me from the prayer time alarm clock my grandparents sent to us from Egypt. The pictures throughout the book — of men in sophisticated suits and fezes, of made up brides on the days of their weddings, of women with soft yet powerful smiles — looked so similar to the pictures in my family’s photo album that it felt as if I was holding its leather binding in my hands.
Unlike El Saadawi, though, my Egyptian childhood was a transplant in a foreign and hostile place. In my German magnet schools, during a War on Terror, in monochrome suburbia, I grew ashamed of my culture. Whenever my white friends from school came over to my house, I ran around the living room frantically trying to cover whatever could potentially expose our difference, always in vain because I never could reach in time the prayer rugs and Arabic calligraphy that hung high on walls painted vivid greens and reds and oranges. When some of the girls at school pointed out, laughing, the way my hair curled in on itself, I tried desperately to braid and twist and burn it into straightness, again in vain as curly poofs escaped my tight braids and the straightening iron never reached close enough to my scalp to eliminate its volume. I grew to hate our mushy ful and the grainy sound of the azan and the trashy makeup and outfits in the photographs from Egypt that my parents took so much pride in. I hated being Egyptian, wishing desperately that I could rid myself of it.
Reading “Daughter of Isis”, I was confronted with all the parts of myself that I had tried to tuck away for so long, parts of myself that were too Egyptian for the white world I lived in. The memories that had previously brought me shame emerged on the printed page and were described in beautiful language with a tone of nostalgia and pride. My mother, who greets her female guests in our sufra with big hair and bright hot-pink lipstick and a dress that fits a little too tightly, is transformed from a ridiculous caricature into a woman who resembles “the queen of Egypt”, with a voice “radiant and pure like fresh water in a stream”, a woman who holds her femininity with the power and poise that I inherited. Embarrassment turns into esteem when I see her through El Saadawi’s eyes, eyes that have not been colonized. Looking through her eyes, I learn there is a way to exist firmly and assuredly in my culture with all of its beauties, flaws, and imperfections, to love despite displacement. She does not throw away Egypt when Egypt exiles her.
Through El Saadawi and other Egyptian artists, I am growing my affection for the place that made me, recognizing it in all of its vibrance and confusion, all of its commotion and splendor. Is this what it means to decolonize your mind? To unlock memories stored in vaults? To relearn the correct pronunciation of your name? To remember the way your throat feels when you make the hard “ha” and “aa” sounds? To embrace the contradictions?
In the silence, I make out a faint song playing in my mind, the music that filled the air in our microcosm of Egypt ten years ago. This Thanksgiving, I dream of mulukhiyah served with warm pita and ma’amoul stuffed with ripe dates and pistachios and koshari that burns your tongue as you can’t stop eating it. I scroll through social media posts of families gathered over the traditional American Thanksgiving dinner and feel no envy. I taste hints of vinegary wara’ enab and the crispy outer layer of kibbeh and the sweetness of basbousa as it melts in my mouth. I keep reading, slowly turning up the volume until the sounds of my country overtake me, and I think to myself, “Egypt, my beloved.” Ya Habibti, Ya Masr, Ya Masr.

When Patrick (not his real name) accepted a job as a part-time Harvard researcher in early 2017, he was enthusiastic.
Fresh off a stint as a consultant, he said he felt excited to switch professional gears. Though his new job did not pay as well as the old, Patrick’s boss said he could expect a promotion to a full-time position in two or three months. Patrick told himself the wait was worth it — he thought it was “obvious” that Harvard would be “a great place to work,” he recalled in an interview last week.
What Patrick did not foresee was that he would soon burn through his savings while remaining employed on a part-time basis for 15 months. During that time, he said he often worked beyond the maximum 17.5 hours that a “less than half time” worker — his official designation at the school — is permitted to put in per week under Harvard policies.
Patrick went unpaid for the extra time. And he went without the benefits afforded to full-time colleagues putting in similar hours, including employer-provided healthcare and retirement contributions. Patrick spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from higher-ups at Harvard.
He is not the only one.
Hundreds of part-time workers at Harvard suffered a fate similar to Patrick’s last year, according to a 2018 analysis of University employment data conducted by the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the school’s largest labor union. Part-time workers at Harvard are supposed to obey specific, school-established limits on how often and for how long they can work.
But departments and schools across the University repeatedly violated these limits last year, according to HUCTW’s analysis. The union found that Harvard paid and treated 291 individuals as temporary or half-time workers in 2018 even though these employees were putting in “excessive hours.”
In its analysis, the union wrote Harvard is relying on “loopholes” and “policy work-arounds” to eke out an unjustifiable amount of uncompensated work from its supposedly part-time staff.
Asked about the status of the 291 employees, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson did not challenge the validity of the union’s analysis. She wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not believe the phenomenon is a widespread problem.
She added that Harvard could have done a better job clarifying its policies.
Part-time workers in Cambridge fall into two main categories: less-than-half time (commonly referred to as “LHTs”) and temporary employees, known as “temps.” The positions are non-unionized.
The University hires individuals in these categories to fill short-term and low-hours positions. Per Harvard policy, temps may be employed by the University for no more than 90 days, and LHTs must work less than 17.5 hours per week.
Under HUCTW’s most recent contract with Harvard, settled in 2015 and expired in Sept. 2018, the University and the union agreed that Harvard should only hire temps and LHTs during work or staffing shortages. HUCTW, a catch-all union, represents clerical and technical workers as well as librarians, lab technicians, and staff assistants.
“It is a fundamental ideal of the Harvard workplace that, although temporary (Temp) or less than half-time (LHT) staffing is a necessary employment vehicle at Harvard, the use of Temp and LHT workers should be exceptional and strictly limited, and never at the expense of regular benefitted employment,” the contract reads.
But, according to the union’s 2018 analysis of Harvard employment data — derived from a more than 50,000-row spreadsheet Harvard was forced to provide during contract negotiations — the number of temps and LHTs employed by the University has increased by 11 percent over the past three years. During the 2017 fiscal year alone, over 4,000 temps and LHTs performed over 920,000 hours of labor for the University — an amount of work equivalent to what 500 “regular, full-time” employees could have produced.
Jackson wrote in an emailed statement that many of the details about Harvard’s use of contingent workers reported in HUCTW’s 2018 analysis did not violate the guidelines outlined in the union’s 2015 contract.
“Much of what HUCTW has released regarding the use of 'temporary' or 'Less than half time' employees was allowable under the old contract, which both parties agreed to years earlier,” Jackson wrote.
The 291 employees HUCTW alleges were overworked in 2018 put in 17.5 hours per week or more on average over the year, or were temps whom Harvard cycled between LHT and temp status in an apparent attempt to evade the 90-day limit.
When the full-time job offer that Patrick had been expecting failed to materialize, he became one of the workers constantly switched between LHT and temp status, he said. He hung on, waiting for a signal that his boss planned to fulfill his promise and bring Patrick on full-time.
Patrick said he knows even being able to bear this uncertainty was a privilege.
“Most people are not going to be able to stick around for a while, or if they feel that they have no other options, they're going to continue to get strung along, even if the prospects of getting full-time are not great,” he said.
“One thing I have noticed about it, at least where I work, is the constant state of precarity,” he added.
According to HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger, the problem is widespread, affecting researchers, librarians, and assistants across Harvard’s schools.
“I mean, you couldn't get to numbers like that — you couldn't get to a million hours and three hundred people working outside the rules — you couldn't get to that with just a couple parts of the University," Jaeger said. “Departments were using this category basically for cheap labor that they had a lot of control over.”
Jaeger said that the issue as a whole generates “a fair amount of strong feeling” among temps, LHTs, and union members alike.
"There's even sort of a moral component in a way,” Jaeger said. “I mean, we would see this as being Harvard's piece of the gig economy problem."
"It's just wrong for Harvard to be holding employees in this category where they're really under-benefitted,” he added.
When HUCTW negotiators sat down at the bargaining table with Harvard officials last semester, they already knew one of the major items on their agenda: improving the experiences of the school’s part-time workers.
"We felt like we have started in recent years to see increasingly aggressive or creative methods in some of the Harvard units for kind of working around those rules, or dancing around them, or frankly, in some cases, just flouting them,” Jaeger said.
Both Jaeger and Jackson agreed that, in many cases, the University has a legitimate need to use LHTs and temps — for example, to staff short-term projects or to fill positions with low workloads.
“Operating an institution such as Harvard is complex, and this classification of employees provides us with the critical flexibility to meet our obligations to our students, faculty, and staff without interruption each day,” Jackson wrote.
In a September interview, HUCTW president Carrie Barbash cited the union’s proposal to reform temp and LHT use as one of three “most critical” policies that could chart the course of negotiations. At the time, she said the two sides’ proposals regarding the use of temps and LHTs were “too far apart” to enable any kind of agreement.
Negotiations continued for weeks past their late September deadline before Harvard and the union reached a detente. In the end, the two parties agreed to a contract proposal that Jaeger said was built on a process of “really good modern, effective negotiation.”
"I think attitudes changed over the course of the process,” Jaeger said. “I think we were able to help University administrators understand that there was more of a problem there than they might've thought at the beginning of the process."
Under the new policy, LHT employees can work only 14 hours per week. The 2018 contract also includes a provision meant to curb cycling — a worker can only be switched from LHT to temp status, or vice versa, one time in the course of their employment.
A joint union-Harvard committee will oversee compliance, and the University must share “comprehensive data” with the union regularly so that members can monitor how many hours LHTs and temps work, as well as the duration of their employment, per the new policy.
David Weil, dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University and a former Obama administration labor official, called the contract proposal a “novel” and “innovative” solution to a predicament many employers currently face. He noted the United States economy is increasingly reliant on contingent workers such as temps and LHTs.
But Weil noted that the success of the solution is not yet certain. He said it will largely depend on how well the University implements the agreement over time.
“You can have beautiful language in a collective bargaining agreement or beautiful language on the books of laws, but it’s really about how well are you able to enforce them, how well can you make them real,” Weil said.
Before the policy can take effect, HUCTW’s members must ratify the new contract in a vote slated to take place Dec. 4. If the contract passes, those affected will begin to see the new policy’s effects in March, at the close of a 90-day adjustment period.
During the 90 days, schools and departments across the University will have to make a choice: will they convert part-time positions now filled by overworked individuals into full-time jobs? Or will they double down and keep hiring a series of LHTs and temps, sending them packing once the workers reach the more stringent limits of the new policy?
“It's kind of pressed the departments a lot harder to decide whether they, whether something is a more significant or longer-term need, and if it is, really the only practical way they can fill it is by hiring people the right way, as regular employees with benefits," Jaeger said.
For Rachel — another Harvard part-time worker who, like Patrick, spoke only on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation — this tension is personal.
Rachel (not her real name) hopes to be hired into a full-time position when her current 90-day stint as a temp ends next month. She said the constant job insecurity she faces as she seeks a full-time role at Harvard is “very stressful.”
“In addition to being stressed about whether or not I’ll have a job, I also have to worry about constantly making a good impression,” Rachel wrote in an email. “Even though I’ve been working hard and getting along with everyone, there’s no guarantee that they’ll keep me.”
Patrick’s story had a happy ending. After 15 months, he was hired into the full-time position he still holds today. And he still thinks Harvard is “a great place to work.”
But he’s glad a new policy will likely soon take effect.
“At least with the people I work with, I don't see malicious intent,” he said. “But I do think that the incentives, obviously, are there — and from the University's perspective too, it's obviously cheaper to have people who are temps and LHT hires.”
“So I think it makes a lot of sense to limit both the potential for abuse but also the non-malicious attempts,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University announced Thursday that it will establish a new land company to manage the development of its planned Enterprise Research Campus in Allston.
The Enterprise Research Campus is a University project intended to facilitate collaborations between Harvard-affiliated research projects and “research-focused” companies. Business School Dean Nitin Nohria will chair a governing board that will manage the new land company.
Thomas P. Glynn III, former CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority, will become the management company’s new chief with responsibility for day-to-day operations. As the former leader of Massport, Glynn oversaw negotiations with state transportation officials concerning road and transit services in Boston.
In March 2018, the Boston Planning and Development Agency approved a master plan for the development of an initial 14 acres of the Enterprise Research Campus. The University eventually plans for the research campus to take up as much as 36 acres in Allston.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a press release Thursday that the University is moving into Allston to stay.
“Allston will be Greater Boston’s next epicenter of research, discovery, and innovation, and we want to speed progress toward that goal.” Bacow said in a statement.
While Harvard has owned some land in Allston for decades, its presence has grown in recent years as the University significantly expands into the neighborhood. Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences plans to open a new campus in Allston in fall 2020.
In accordance with the “cooperation agreements” negotiated with City Hall, the University is running numerous programs involving community outreach and aiming to minimize the impact of Harvard’s expansion on housing costs.
Nohria wrote in a press release that Harvard’s development in Allston will take place over many years. “This is a project that will operate on multiple timescales. It’s worth noting that it’s taken Harvard almost 400 years to develop 214 acres in Cambridge. So we should not be impatient," he wrote.
Nohria added, “The companies we hope to attract to the ERC might be places where our students find exciting internships and jobs. They may inspire students to create new companies. They may be research enterprises with which our scholars will forge productive collaborations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes Doris Reina-Landaverde wanted to ask artist Annie J. Liang why she wasn’t painting a professor, or a famous person. Why her, a custodian working at the Extension School?
The goal of “Harvard Works 2.0,” an eight-part portrait series on exhibition in the Science Center, is to challenge the premise of this question.
“We only respect people who have the highest degrees or the highest grades,” Liang, the artist behind the exhibit, said. “We don’t respect people just for themselves. We’re all human. We all want to be respected.”
Each painting is a stencil of a Harvard worker superimposed over different textures of Harvard walls.
Liang, who graduated from the Graduate School of Design this past spring, developed the idea for the exhibition in VIS2448: “Painting for Designers,” a class she took with Professor Ewa Harabasz in the fall of 2016.
For one assignment, the students were asked to draw on top of concrete, a ubiquitous texture in the Design School’s Gund Hall. Liang said she was inspired to capture the social landscape of the school — that is, “the workers, and the people who support the institution in all its activities.”
Despite their work being as foundational to the University as its physical structures themselves, the hours they dedicate to supporting the institution often go unnoticed, Liang said. She said “Harvard Works 2.0” integrates those who do maintenance work into the layers of the painting — reimagining Harvard’s history with Harvard’s workers at the forefront.
“We exist,” Reina-Landaverde said. “And we are here.”
“All the things, all the meetings, all the emails I have to be sending, talking, and doing to make this place run smoothly — a lot of people don’t see it because it is on the inside,” said Yuleyca Ortiz, the security supervisor at the GSD and one of the subjects of the series. “But it is very difficult to run a place.”
In addition to highlighting the work done by Harvard’s custodial and security staff, “Harvard Works 2.0” also raises awareness about the struggles Harvard’s workers may be facing.
Reina-Landaverde arrived in the United States from El Salvador in 2000 and is a recipient of Temporary Protected Status, a designation the U.S. Department of Homeland Security grants to certain foreign nationals who are unable to return to their country of citizenship due to unsafe circumstances like armed conflict or natural disaster.
TPS recipients can legally live and work in the U.S. and are immune from deportation. The status is temporary, but previous presidential administrations have largely left the program alone, allowing recipients to continue residing legally in the US.
The Trump administration, though, has moved to end the designation for foreign nationals from certain countries. Following the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal TPS, workers at Harvard have taken part in activism to defend TPS, holding multiple rallies, appealing to former University President Drew G. Faust to take action to protect workers from deportation, and calling on the University for greater legal aid.
Despite a U.S. district judge’s October injunction against the Trump’s administration’s decision to terminate TPS, recipients — including Reina-Landaverde — face uncertain futures.
The Dean’s Diversity Initiative — a standing committee at the Design School tasked with advancing inclusion — and John S. Wilson Jr., senior advisor and strategist to the President on diversity and inclusion, co-sponsored the show.
Wilson wrote in an emailed statement that he found Liang’s portrait project to align well with the values Harvard’s Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging outlined last year — especially since the project aims to increase visual representation of those who work at Harvard beyond the white academics and administrators who have historically occupied space on the University’s walls.
“That has become awkward, at least, because it is not entirely reflective of how Harvard has been evolving.” Wilson wrote, referring to the University's traditional decor. Organizers wanted to “exhibit the new and diverse images of some of the other key people who help make Harvard University the prestigious institution it is today,” Wilson wrote.
“We are [the] Harvard community,” Reina-Landaverde said. “We know we have to stick together.”
For Ortiz, her inclusion in “Harvard Works 2.0” was above all a reminder to herself that the work she puts in at Harvard has been paying off.
“It doesn’t matter that sometimes I feel like a failure, that I’m not doing my very best,” Ortiz said. Seeing that picture and the caption accompanying it, she said, confirms that “I am doing okay.”

A Harvard Law School student group focused on ending harassment and discrimination in the legal profession praised the D.C. Circuit Court for its recent adoption of workplace conduct policies in a statement Thursday.
The student group, the Pipeline Parity Project, has been advocating for policy changes that address workplace misconduct in the court system since its founding in April.
The court's policy changes institute a workplace environmental climate survey, appoint workplace relations coordinators, and create an employee advisory group.
Organization member and second-year Law student Sejal Singh praised the new policies as a “powerful step forward” in a written statement.
“[O]f 1,300 misconduct claims filed under the JC&D rules in 2016, not a single one was filed by law clerks,” Singh wrote. “The Judiciary’s zero percent reporting rate highlights the judiciary’s inadequate system for handling complaints of harassment and clerks’ acute fear of retaliation should they come forward.”
"JC&D" refers to "judicial conduct & disability."
D.C. Court Chief Judges Merrick B. Garland ’74 and Beryl A. Howell wrote in a statement that "ensuring a workplace free of sexual harassment and other misconduct, including retaliation for reporting harassment and misconduct, is of the highest priority in the D.C. Circuit.”
Members of the Pipeline Parity Project and other law students have been advocating for such changes for several months.
In August, a group of Harvard and Yale law students sent a memo to the Judicial Conference of the United States — the policy-making body for U.S. federal courts — urging the conference to a “adopt reforms regarding the role and responsibilities of law schools in reporting and responding to complaints of harassment and other abusive workplace practices.”
That memo came in response to recommendations put forward by the Federal Judiciary Workplace Conduct Working Group, a committee formed following reports that former Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski sexually harassed several of his clerks and employees. Kozinski, who stepped down in the wake of the allegations, has said he never intended to make his clerks uncomfortable.
In October, members of the Pipeline Parity Project penned an open letter to the Judicial Conference calling for three policies they believed were missing from the working group’s recommendations: a climate survey, an informal reporting structure, and a centralized office to receive reports. Hundreds of students from law schools across the country signed the letter. Pipeline Parity Project members also sent recommendations to the Judicial Conference earlier this month.
Second-year Law student and Pipeline Parity Project member Emma R. Janger said in an interview Thursday that the group set out at its founding to organize in response to Kozinski’s alleged sexual harassment of clerks.
“One of the absolutely founding sort of impetuses for Pipeline was the allegations that came out against Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski,” Janger said. “One of the reasons Pipeline was founded was in response . . . the fact that as much as the allegations sent shockwaves, by many important players in the legal profession, Kozinski’s harassment was viewed as an open secret.”
The changes to the D.C. Circuit also come after the contentious confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Kavanaugh, who previously served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, has been accused of sexual assault by at least two women — one who alleges Kavanaugh assaulted her when both were in high school, and one who says Kavanaugh assaulted her while they were in college.
The conservative justice taught at the Law School for almost a decade. The Pipeline Parity Project organized protests at the Law School against Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings and called on administrators to bar him from teaching. The Law School later announced that the embattled judge indicated he would not return to teach his class in January.
The Pipeline Parity Project has also spoken out against mandatory arbitration agreements at law firms. The group recently focused its efforts on pressing the world’s highest grossing firm — Kirkland & Ellis — to eliminate these contract provisions, which prevent employees from pursuing workplace complaints in court. The firm announced last week it was dropping the agreements after weeks of pressure from the student group.
Going forward, group members hope other courts will adopt policies like the D.C. Circuit's new protocols.
“Right now, we’re calling on every other circuit to at least match this plan,” Janger said. “If they want to take it further, if they want to implement even stronger policies, that’s great — but this should be the benchmark going forward for all other eleven circuits across the country.”

Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have developed a microscopic material called a “metacorrector” that fixes chromatic aberrations in lenses — a revolutionary alternative to the bulky, expensive glass lenses used today, according to a study published in Nano Letters on Nov. 13.
Applied Physics Professor Federico Capasso, postdoctoral fellow Wei-Ting Chen, and graduate student Alexander Y. Zhu pioneered this technology, alongside other members of the Capasso Group and researchers at other institutions.
A single-material lens will focus different wavelengths of light to slightly different points, according to Chen. The discrepancy between the wavelengths’ focal points creates a blurry effect, known as a chromatic aberration. Since the 17th century, traditional lenses have remedied this problem by combining multiple glass materials. The image is no longer blurry, but the lenses themselves are heavier and more costly to manufacture.
“Without putting two glasses together, there is no way to compensate for chromatic aberrations, according to conventional wisdom,” Chen said.
The metacorrector presents an alternative to chunky lenses.
Chen and his collaborators defied centuries of convention by developing a “single layer nanostructure” that varies lens curvature in response to the specific wavelength of light hitting the lens. For example, the metacorrector functions as a convex lens for red light — meaning the lens is curved outward — and as a concave lens for blue light — meaning the lens is curved inward.
“If you have a lens, its curvature determines the function,” Chen said. “Here, it actually varies its function from concave lens to convex lens, depending on the incident wavelengths. That’s the key to overcoming chromatic aberrations in our design.”
Chen said the metacorrector has the potential to make any optical system more compact, from microscopes, to augmented and virtual reality devices, to cameras.
Visual Arts Professor Alfred Guzzetti ’64 said the idea of manipulating lens curvature on a nanoscale level is “pretty amazing.” He said he was especially fascinated by how the action of light hitting the lens could instruct the lens to behave in a particular way.
In particular, Guzzetti said the cost-effectiveness of the metacorrector would avoid the steep manufacturing costs of high-end lenses, which can cost upwards of $12,00, and make the technology more accessible to everyday consumers.
Visual and Environmental Studies Department Chair Robb Moss wrote in an email that the metacorrector — like other technological developments in film, such as zoom lenses and the ability to shoot in low light — will create opportunities for filmmakers to experiment and innovate.
“I am excited to see how these new lenses will see the world,” Moss wrote.
Harvard has protected the intellectual property concerning the metacorrector and is looking into the possibility of commercializing its technology, according to a SEAS press release published Nov. 19.

Harvard professors decried the Trump administration's asylum policies to a packed room at the Law School Thursday, condemning in particular the administration's treatment of caravans of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the United States — the latest flashpoint in the country's immigration debate.
In the hour-long panel, “The Migrant Caravan and the Law and Politics of the Border,” Anthropology Professor Ieva Jusionyte and Law School Assistant Clinical Professor Sabrineh Ardalan spoke about the legal, social, and political issues surrounding migrant caravans. Three Law School student organizations — Harvard Immigration Project, Mexican Law Students Association, and La Alianza — hosted the event.
Ardalan began her remarks with an explanation of asylum laws and their historical origins in the aftermath of World War II.
Ardalan specifically criticized the Trump administration’s effort to prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they do not enter through a “port of entry.” She referred to this policy as the federal government’s latest effort to “roll back asylum protections” for Central American refugees fleeing violence.
“For purposes of seeking asylum, it doesn’t matter where a person enters the U.S.,” she said after she read excerpts from U.S. asylum law, which empowers migrants to apply for asylum regardless of their immigration status or where they enter the country. “The executive branch can’t just rewrite what Congress did.”
In her remarks, Ardalan also rejected the perception that migrants somehow manipulate the asylum system to gain entry into the United States.
“This isn’t a loophole by any means,” she said. “In fact, it’s really hard to gain access to protections that people have a right to.”
Both professors focused on portrayals of migrants and asylum seekers in political discourses and public media. They specifically described Trump’s portrayal of migrant caravans as an “invasion” as an attempt to dehumanize immigrants. One large caravan from Central America originally grabbed Trump's attention in the spring. That group has since splintered, and several other caravans have followed in its wake.
“[They are] individuals with stories who have really compelling reasons for making a harrowing journey risking their lives and the lives of their small children to save their lives,” Ardalan said.
“By eliminating that real life context of why people are leaving and dehumanizing them, it’s easier to gain public opinion to push through these draconian policies,” she added.
Jusionyte said the Trump administration is not the only party using charged language around immigration, however. She referenced metaphors members of the media and of the public use when discussing immigration.
“People who have the right to ask for asylum and are running for their lives are portrayed as part of this big ‘wave’ that will ‘overflow’ the United States and destroy all of the border,” she said. “Perhaps the president’s rhetoric is a little harsher but it’s in all of how we talk about migration.”
Both professors underscored students’ capacity to change the narrative around immigration.
Ardalan emphasized the power of storytelling. She suggested reframing immigration debates “to connect people to narratives with shared values — values that we all have in common — that we can come back to to try to unify people around messages as opposed to dividing people.”
Harvard Law student and La Alianza member Perla F. “Fabi” Alvelais, who attended the event, reiterated the speakers' statements. She said the national discourse surrounding immigrants from Central America is “upsetting” and “completely wrong.”
“It’s very upsetting to see how much that rhetoric has stuck with a lot of people and how a lot of people have accepted that,” Alvelais said. “So I think our job in La Alianza as law students is to pushback and show how talented and committed and great our community is.”
Jusionyte applauded students’ passion for the issue. Some Law students have worked with immigration clinics and humanitarian organizations at the border.
“Even for people who are not necessarily studying law,” she added, “there are such ways as to just donate to [American Civil Liberties Union] or these shelters in Mexico or on the U.S. border.”

The Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum hosted a public panel, “Improving Outcomes for Children Through Collaborative Action,” about applying strategies to accelerate positive and equitable outcomes for youth education on Thursday evening.
The panel featured a conversation between Jennifer Blatz, president and CEO of StriveTogether, Michael McAfee, president and CEO of PolicyLink, and Laura Pinsoneault, director of evaluation at the Spark Policy Institute and was moderated by Paul Reville, a professor at GSE. More than 100 people attended the event.
Thursday’s forum was part of the Harvard Education Redesign Lab 2018 Leadership Institute, an initiative born from a GSE meeting in June 2017 on developing leaders to improve children’s education outcomes, according to Jennifer Davis, a Senior Associate at the GSE.
At the panel, Blatz cited the importance of data analysis in her work in Portland, Oregon and Northern Kentucky schools. She emphasized using qualitative data, such as interviewing parents, to supplement statistics, and pointed to Portland as an instance of the success of this approach.
“They had to look at really deep data to understand ‘Why were black children having greater numbers of discipline referrals?’” Blatz said. For instance, local organizations looked at when discipline referrals occurred, and then moved snack time earlier in the day to alleviate the issue. Blatz said these organizations were able to “reduce the disproportionate discipline of black children by 38 percent.”
When asked how he balances efficiency and equity when mobilizing his diverse community, McAfee said that efficiency is always secondary.
“Equity is not an aside, it is the work,” McAfee said. “Top down, elite orientation where whiteness is centered over everything else meant we weren’t dealing with equity, we were dealing with what civic elites wanted to do at a particular time.”
McAfee underscored the importance of race in addressing educational disparities.
“If you’re afraid to name your people, if you’re afraid to say black folk, poor white folk, or poor Asians, you can’t talk about equity and you’re not on the edge of anything but maintaining your position,” McAfee said.
Pinsoneault spoke about a recent study she conducted examining the efficacy of the collective impact strategy, in which different organizations work together toward common goals.
Collective impact, “in and of itself it is not the panacea for all of the hard work that has to happen,” Pinsoneault said. She recommended organizations focus on providing “backbone support” by developing effective leaders.
Christy M. Chang, a masters student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and an audience member, said she found the panel “thought-provoking.”
“I have never been involved professionally with collective action,” she said. “It made me realize that there is a lot that we have not solved yet and having the data is not enough. There have to be people that know how to tell the right story with the data.”
Davis said she hoped the public, live-streamed forum would reach a broader audience.
“The fact that social mobility is decreasing, the American dream is no longer achievable for so many people in this country,” Davis said. “We have to have more communities all over the country putting together these collaborations on behalf of children.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jerome B. Karabel ’72, a sociologist at University of California, Berkeley, discussed the history of Harvard’s admissions policies and suggested potential reforms at a Law School lecture Thursday.
Karabel has written widely about the history of race-conscious admissions at elite universities. In 2005, he published “The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.”
Attendees packed into an overflowing lecture hall just weeks after the conclusion of a three-week long admissions trial between the University and Students for Fair Admissions, an anti-affirmative action group. SFFA sued the University in 2014 for allegedly discriminating against Asian-American applicants during the admissions process. The trial ended Nov. 2, but both SFFA and the University are expected to present an additional set of arguments to Judge Allison D. Burroughs in February.
Thursday's lecture addressed four themes: the history of discrimination against Jewish students in Harvard’s admissions process during the 1920s, the rise of affirmative action against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement, charges that Harvard discriminated against Asian students in the 1980s, and recommendations for how Harvard should reform its admissions practices today.
Karabel argued that the roots of Harvard’s current admissions process — which takes into account factors like “character” and “leadership" — lie in changes spearheaded by President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, class of 1877, in reaction to Harvard’s increased population of Jewish students, who comprised upwards of a quarter of the College’s population in the 1920s.
He recounted the boom in black students admitted to Harvard in the wake of the student protests during the Civil Rights Movement — especially after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in 1968 — and discussed how the rise of affirmative action policies laid the groundwork for debates about equity in admissions that continue today.
The remainder of the lecture focused on proposals for reforming Harvard’s admissions process. Karabel said he would like to see the elimination of special consideration for the children of donors and legacies, arguing that these policies could be discontinued without negatively impacting the University’s endowment.
“Of the world’s ten leading universities, five have no legacy preference,” Karabel said. “I say with considerable confidence that, if they were to eliminate legacy admissions — that’s hardly the only reason people give money to Harvard — Harvard would be fine.”
Other reforms Karabel suggested include diminishing the preference given to recruited athletes, who are currently admitted at an estimated rate of 76 to 86 percent. He also called for the abolition of Harvard’s “Z-list,” which gives a small number of students a deferred admissions option each year.
Lastly, Karabel said he would like to see Harvard admit more students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Though he acknowledged that Harvard already provides significant aid for students from low-income and middle-income families, he pointed out that nevertheless, close to 70 percent of Harvard students still come from families with a household income in the top 20 percent.
“Put simply, I’d like to see my alma mater doing the right thing. I don’t think that’s happening now,” Karabel said.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment.
In a previous statement, Dane wrote, “In our admissions process, we give careful, individual attention to each applicant. We seek to identify students who will be the best educators of one another and their professors—individuals who will inspire those around them during their College years and beyond.”
Attendees of Thursday's event included students from the Graduate School of Education who had read Karabel’s papers in classes and Harvard affiliates interested in the ongoing admissions lawsuit.
“In the Asian-American community in the Law School we’re having a conversation about what affirmative action means to us and how we balance understanding that there is a historical need for affirmative action with discrimination that is actively against Asians,” Elizabeth Gyori, a third-year Law student, said. “[We want] to have that conversation in a meaningful way and build solidarity across groups.”
The Progressive Jewish Alliance at Harvard Law School organized the event, which was co-sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, Harvard Hillel, the Jewish Law Students Association, the Harvard South Asian Law Students Association, and La Alianza, an organization of Latinx and Latin American law students.
“The issue of affirmative action in college admissions is a matter of interest to our community on a variety of levels,” Ian D. Eppler, co-founder and events chair of the Progressive Jewish Alliance at HLS, said. “We wanted to bring a historical perspective to the dialogue.”

The Division of Continuing Education and other executive programs at Harvard have seen more than five straight years of growth in revenue from student tuition, outpacing revenue growth from University-wide tuition each time, according to the latest University financial report.
The DCE comprises Harvard Extension School, Harvard Summer School, and professional development programs. Last year, continuing and executive education brought in more than $450 million in tuition revenue — a growth of more than 11.5 percent from the previous year and more than 60 percent over the past seven years. In comparison, University-wide tuition revenue grew by just 6.4 percent last year.
Course enrollment at DCE has correspondingly skyrocketed. Over the past five years, the Summer School has seen a nearly 50 percent increase in enrollment, according to University spokesperson Harry J. Pierre. The past seven years at the Extension School have seen a nearly 25 percent increase in enrollment, to 31,964 course enrollees last school year, according to Pierre.
Enrollment figures for DCE’s professional development programs were unavailable. Executive education, which brings in professionals to teach them management skills, is considered quite profitable. Participants in one executive education program offered by the Harvard Business School attend one three-week session per year for three years. In 2018, the first session will cost $42,500.
Huntington D. Lambert, dean of the DCE, said although revenue has grown, that trend has not necessarily been reflected in DCE’s operating surplus.
“We’ve lowered surplus to fund quality improvements and growth within the Division and are now just returning to prior levels of surplus,” Lambert said. “Our relatively inexpensive tuition model is great for our learners. But because of that lower number, earning a surplus is difficult.”
Pierre wrote in an email that DCE has recently upgraded its technology and improved the quality of courses, contributing to lower surplus figures.
“In the first three years of Dean Lambert’s tenure, DCE made significant investments of several million dollars in modernizing the department, technology for course delivery and increased staffing to meet the needs of our learners,” Pierre wrote. “The investment was taken from DCE reserves and over the past two years, we’ve been able to pay that back.”
More than just staying self-sufficient, DCE also allocates some of its surplus to the University. In fact, in Harvard’s most recent capital campaign, DCE raised money for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
DCE Tuition, which has risen each year for the past six years, depends on DCE revenue and expenses after money is given back to the University, according to Lambert.
“We build our tuition from costs and aim to break even or make a slight surplus after allocating funds back to the University,” Lambert said.
Though tuition has increased, so has financial aid, which supports degree candidates at the Extension School and high-schoolers in the Summer School, Lambert said. DCE also offers the Tuition Assistance Program, which allows employees to take Extension courses for $40. Tuition for a single graduate course is currently $2,750.
“In the 2016-17 year alone, just over 2,000 Harvard employees have taken advantage of TAP through the Extension School,” Pierre wrote. “It’s just such a huge, important benefit that while technically isn’t financial aid, does provide continuing [education] opportunities at a deep discount.”

Graduate students in four Faculty of Arts and Sciences programs reported rates of depression climbing as high as 31 percent — a figure more than six times the national average — according to results from a recently completed round of mental health surveys.
Harvard University Health Services developed the questionnaires in collaboration with students studying Earth and Planetary Sciences, Physics, Integrative Life Sciences, and Economics, HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email Thursday. Though students at Harvard Law School filled out a similar survey, Barreira did not include their responses in the aggregate results.
This study marks the second time that Economics graduate students have filled out surveys about their mental health in recent years. HUHS first sampled them two years ago in a survey that revealed many within their ranks experience symptoms of depression and anxiety. Graduate students in the other three programs joined this year’s study after they reached out to Barreira.
Across the four departments, the percentage of students who reported symptoms — whether occasional or recurring — ranged from 15 to 31 percent for depression and 14.7 to 31 percent for anxiety. Within those groups, between 5.4 and 12 percent reported moderate to severe depression and between 6.6 and 14 percent reported moderate to severe anxiety.
Barreira declined to tether individual data points to specific departments, and did not give all four percentages for each category of the survey. Instead, he provided a range containing the highest and lowest reported rates for each question. In an email, he wrote that revealing more specific data could compromise the privacy of survey respondents, though he added more detailed results may become public if an institutional review board subsequently approves the study.
The results of the first Economics survey spurred a national study, which came out this month and found that 18 percent of 500 Economics Ph.D. students across eight schools experience “moderate or severe” symptoms of depression or anxiety. Eleven percent said they have recently experienced suicidal thoughts.
The first 11 questions of the HUHS survey measured metrics including depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-esteem. Each department included additional questions designed to gather data about topics like advising, lab experience, and “the learning environment,” according to Barreira.
Barreira said in an interview Thursday that he saw evidence of a “stigma problem” in the data — the survey showed that some students who reported severe mental health concerns are “not considering getting treatment.”
Multiple departments are taking steps to address students’ mental health in response to survey results. Earth and Planetary Sciences Professor David T. Johnston wrote in an email that his department has formed a committee of graduate students to “lead the charge” on mental health. The Integrative Life Sciences department has held a series of town halls to discuss the survey results, according to an email sent by director Grace B. Gill. After the first round of surveys in the Economics department, a group of graduate students started a peer advising program.
Johnston wrote that he thinks the survey could make graduate students’ mental health struggles more concrete.
“Without a formal survey in place prior to this most recent effort, the discussion at the faculty level was simply about what we see and hear, both directly and indirectly,” he wrote. “One of the great things about the new initiative by HUHS to conduct such surveys is that we can both learn from, and potentially team up with, sister departments to try and make our Harvard community a healthier and happier one.”
As the survey expands to more departments next semester, Barreira said he hopes to keep the format relatively similar to the one used this semester. Classics, Romance Languages and Literature, Sociology, and Philosophy number among the departments whose graduate students will receive the next round of questionnaires.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is currently facing a wrongful death lawsuit accusing the University and several of its employees of negligence in their care for a Harvard undergraduate, Luke Z. Tang ’18, who died by suicide in Sept. 2015.
The student’s father, Wendell W. Tang, filed the suit in the Middlesex County Superior Court on Sept. 11, one day shy of the three-year anniversary of his son’s death. The complaint names the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — as well as residential dean Catherine R. Shapiro, Lowell House Resident Dean Caitlin Casey, Harvard University Health Services mental health counselor Melanie G. Northrop, and HUHS psychiatrist David W. Abramson as defendants.
The complaint accuses each of the defendants of “negligence and carelessness” that resulted in Luke Tang’s death and argues the defendants are responsible for damages amounting to at least $20 million.
“As a direct and proximate result of Harvard’s negligence and carelessness, the Plaintiff’s decedent was caused severe conscious physical and mental pain and suffering and further, the Plaintiff’s decedent was caused to commit suicide,” the complaint reads.
The lawsuit filing outlines Luke Tang’s struggle with suicidal ideation, his suicide attempt during his freshman year at Harvard, and the consultation he received from Harvard officials following his return to campus. The complaint alleges Luke Tang entered into a contract prepared by Shapiro, Northrop, and Abramson shortly after his freshman year suicide attempt. The contract stipulated that Luke Tang must receive mental health counseling in order to remain on campus.
Luke Tang left Harvard for the summer in May 2015 and did not receive mental health counseling between that time and his death in September, according to the complaint. The suit alleges the University and its employees were negligent for failing to fulfill the “duty of care” they assumed in their relationships with Luke Tang.
The suit remains in the preliminary stages of litigation, and the University’s lawyers have yet to file a response to the complaint in court. An initial schedule issued by the court lists Jan. 9, 2019 as the deadline for a response from Harvard.
University spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the case, citing the pending status of the litigation. Neither the plaintiff nor any of the four individually named defendants responded to requests for comment.
Though he did not comment on the lawsuit itself, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email that his “thoughts and prayers continue to be with everyone who knew and loved Luke.”
“Losing a child is among the most painful things that can happen to a family,” he wrote.
In the years following Luke Tang’s death, his parents have worked to raise awareness for mental health issues — especially as they affect Asian-American communities — and they have created a memorial fund in their son's honor.
In 2017, a group of filmmakers chronicled his parents’ activism and their struggles in a documentary called “Looking for Luke.” His parents were closely involved in the production of the film and penned a letter expressing gratitude for it.
“We need to more fully understand our children and loved ones, and let them know how much we care,” they wrote in a statement shortly after the film’s release. “We hope that after viewing this film, you will have a better understanding of Luke’s life, and help spread awareness of mental health, in an effort to prevent further tragedies from happening.”
The next steps for the case remain unclear. Though Luke Tang’s father is requesting a jury trial, that trial would not begin until 2021 — if it occurs at all, according to court filings.
Wendell Tang’s lawyers filed the 16-page complaint detailing Luke Tang’s struggles and treatment during the final year of his life. The complaint ultimately alleges the University acted with negligence in its relationship with Luke.
A section of the plaintiff’s complaint, entitled “Facts,” outlines the months leading to Luke Tang’s death.
Luke Tang first attempted suicide in April 2015 in a residence hall at Harvard after experiencing symptoms of suicidal ideation, according to the complaint. Within two weeks, Harvard sent Luke Tang to receive inpatient care at McLean Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Belmont, Mass.
During his week-long stay at the hospital, Shapiro visited Luke Tang. Shapiro, who is now the College’s senior resident dean, was a resident dean of freshmen at the time Luke Tang was first hospitalized. The complaint states that, following Luke Tang’s discharge from the hospital, he met with Northrop, who had received reports from psychiatrists at McLean Hospital recommending that Luke Tang receive weekly psychiatric therapy.
That same day, Luke Tang informed Northrop of his plans to travel to China for a week in May of that year. During that meeting, Northrop told him he must speak with his therapist to create a support plan for his time in China. She added that he must continue therapy upon his return to the College.
Shapiro, Northrop, and Abramson helped to prepare a “contract” outlining the terms of Luke Tang’s continued tenure at Harvard, the complaint alleges. Harvard required that Luke Tang agree to the contract in order to remain on campus, and Luke Tang was not allowed to change or negotiate the terms of the contract.
In line with the contract, “Tang was expected to follow the recommendations of his treatment team, including attending sessions regularly and actively participating in his treatment,” the complaint reads.
On May 8, Luke Tang met with Northrop for a check-in, when she discovered he had failed to schedule a follow-up appointment with his therapist. At that meeting, Northrop reminded Luke Tang of Harvard’s expectation that he would continue treatment.
Luke Tang met with Northrop again on May 15. By that time, Shapiro had informed Northrop of her concerns for Luke Tang given his lack of treatment plans for the summer, and that she planned to voice her concerns to Luke Tang’s parents.
The next day, Luke Tang left for his week-long trip to China. He returned to Harvard in August of that same year.
On September 12, Luke Tang died by suicide in Lowell House.
“Tang had no mental health counseling between May 16, 2015 and September 12, 2015,” the complaint alleges.
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry declined to comment on the pending litigation, though he wrote in an email he believes students should be reminded of the mental health services Harvard offers.
“We want to remind students that Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) remains steadfast in its commitment to providing the entire Harvard student community access to safe, effective, and convenient mental health services,” Perry wrote. “If you need help or are experiencing any distress, please contact CAMHS at 617-495-5711.”
The remainder of the complaint lists each of the defendants and the reasons for which Wendell Tang believes they were negligent in their care for Luke Tang. The lawsuit alleges the University and its employees acted in negligence by failing to follow suicide prevention protocols. The complaint lists 12 instances in which it alleges the University showed negligence, including in Harvard employees' decision to design a contract that “failed to provide reasonable safety” for Luke Tang and their alleged failure to uphold the provisions of that contract.
The complaint lists similar allegations of negligence for each individually named defendant, adding that the plaintiff believes Northrop and Abramson were also negligent as medical professionals.
Wendell Tang’s lawyers wrote that the “reckless and/or grossly negligent” conduct of the University’s employees entitles the plaintiff to punitive damages and other costs totaling to more than $20 million.
The September lawsuit filing marks the first stage in what may turn into legal battle that could span years. At present, it is unclear how the suit will progress.
An attached scheduling document lists Jan. 9, 2019 as the deadline for a response to the complaint. The document includes a long-term timeline for the case, under which a trial — if one happens at all — must be scheduled by March 2021. If the case does go to trial, the schedule states the case must be resolved by September 2021.
Wrongful death lawsuits against universities are often resolved by settlements between universities and students’ families before reaching trial, according to Carolyn Reinach Wolf, an attorney who specializes in mental health-related litigation. For suits that do make it to trial, judges’ decisions tend to be highly dependent on the specific circumstances of individual cases.
“There’s not one sort of national standard of ‘if X, then Y,’” Wolf said.
Massachusetts state law provides for the compensation of punitive damages as well as funeral and burial costs in cases of wrongful death resulting from negligence.
Wendell Tang filed his complaint in court with 10 counts against the five defendants. The complaint individually charges Harvard and the four named employees with one count of negligence leading to wrongful death and one count seeking punitive damages.
A similar high-profile case recently rocked MIT’s campus, just a few miles from Harvard. The 2011 suicide of a Ph.D. candidate, Han Nguyen, prompted the suit, which ultimately went before Massachusetts’s Supreme Judicial Court, the state’s highest court of appeals. That court found MIT was not liable for the student’s death and outline specific circumstances that must exist for a university to be held liable. One of those circumstances is a student informing university officials of plans to take his or her own life.
The complaint alleges that Luke Tang’s suicide was “foreseeable” to each of the four named employees cited in the case.
“Prior to September 12, 2015, Harvard, its agents, servants and employees had actual knowledge of Luke Tang’s suicide attempt which occurred while he was enrolled at Harvard and of Luke Tang’s other stated plans or intentions to commit suicide,” the complaint reads.
The law firm that represented Nguyen’s family in the MIT case — Heinlein, Beeler, Mingace & Heineman — is the same firm helping Luke Tang’s father sue Harvard. The firm’s website lists “student suicide” as one of their lawyers’ areas of practice.
Wolf added that factors such as whether a university takes appropriate suicide prevention steps, communicates certain problems to family members and outside professionals, or has taken on a close relationship with a student can determine the viability of wrongful death lawsuits.
The complaint alleges that each of the four named defendants had a “special relationship” with Luke Tang and consequently had a “duty of care” — an obligation to prevent him from self-harm.
Wolf said individual cases vary widely in terms of how universities respond to protocols and how they communicate with family members.
“It’s also important to understand that each case is very different on its facts. Did the student have a past history? Was the student acting out? Were parents calling the school saying, ‘I’m really concerned about my son’?” she said.
This case is not the first wrongful death lawsuit Harvard has faced for an on-campus death. The mother of Justin D. C. D. Cosby, a Cambridge resident who was fatally shot in Kirkland House in 2009, sued the University in 2012. The judge in that case eventually dismissed the suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of two tough losses against Wisconsin on the road, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team is looking to bounce back this weekend at home.
“The opportunity we have ahead of us is a big one,” sophomore forward Becca Gilmore said. “We’re going into the end of the first half of the season, and after the weekend we just had, there’s a new type of energy.”
Last weekend, the Crimson (2-5-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) lost two nail-biters against a stellar Badgers squad (15-1-0, 7-1 WCHA) that made the Frozen Four last year. Harvard took both games to overtime and held Wisconsin scoreless in two of the three periods of each game. Despite the losses, the Crimson emerged with the confidence of knowing it can compete with a top hockey team.
“Last weekend, our team saw the pace that we can play at and saw how much effort we need every single person on our team to put in,” offered Gilmore, the Wayland, Mass. native. “It gave us energy and excitement for the rest of the season.”
Harvard has also internalized the lessons it learned from last weekend’s close matchups.
“Something that we’ve talked about as a team in preparation for this weekend draws off our play from last weekend,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “Playing with a sense of urgency and utilizing our speed is something that we’re really focusing on going into the weekend.”
Gilmore agreed with the importance of speed going forward, and cited an increased pace of play as a way for the team to manufacture more goals.
“We’re really focusing on the pace that we’re setting and always being one step ahead,” she said. “This will be a good way to score some goals and get all the lines contributing to the scoreboard. That’s been a struggle this season, just finishing pucks, so I know that we’re focused on bearing down and being relentless.”
On Friday, the Crimson will take on the Rensselaer Engineers (4-7-4, 2-2-0 ECAC), and on Saturday, the Union Dutchwomen (2-10-2, 0-3-1 ECAC). Last season, Harvard picked up two wins against the Engineers and one win against the Dutchwomen.
Rensselaer is coming off of a loss and a tie to the University of New Hampshire last weekend. Senior Josefine Hansen, who picked up one goal on the weekend, and junior forward Blake Orosz are leading scorers on the Engineers team, with three and four goals, respectively.
Union is also looking to bounce back from a loss last weekend, falling to the Mercyhurst Lakers. Leading scorers Haley Shugart, a junior forward with four goals, and Katelynn Russ, another junior forward with three goals, will look to lead the Dutchwomen offense.
As for the Crimson, points leaders Lexie Laing — the sophomore forward who added the goal that forced overtime on Friday against Wisconsin, Hughes, and Gilmore will look to produce a couple of victories as Harvard takes home ice this weekend. Harvard is undefeated this season when playing at home, so skating at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center is sure to give the team an additional confidence boost in the games ahead.
“It’s always hard, especially at the beginning of the season when there haven’t been many games, to travel and win at an away rink,” Gilmore said. “There’s definitely an energy when we have more fans cheering for us and we just own the rink.”
Being at home accentuates a mentality that the Crimson team tries to take to every game: having pride on the ice.
“The mentality we try to have, home or away, is to own the rink and play with confidence,” said Hughes, the New York, N.Y. native. “That’s definitely a lot easier to do when you’re at home and you have the support of students and faculty at the game. I think we’re really excited to be back at home this weekend and use that advantage to our benefit.”
As Harvard looks to the future, these games represent the beginning of the end of the segment of the season before winter break ­— what many players consider the first half of the season. As such, the Crimson hopes to use these games as a launchpad with which they can jump into the second half of the season and continue building on their recent successes.
“So far, we’ve really focused on and noticed a pattern of improving in every game and in every period as well,” Hughes said. “Before Christmas break comes, we really want to end on a high note so that when we come back, we’re energized and ready to tackle the second half.”
“We have an opportunity to play at an elite level,” Gilmore added. “If we can set the pace, we’ll hopefully dominate the next two games and get a couple wins.”

Harvard women’s basketball plans to extend its winning streak to three games as it prepares to face off against Quinnipiac this Friday night. This marks the second home game of the season as the Crimson hopes to stay undefeated there. Harvard (4-3) outscored Cal State Northridge by 20 points with a final score of 75-55 in its last game and prevailed by nine points in a close game against Jacksonville State to win the CSUN Tournament in Los Angeles.
“This success is definitely giving confidence going into our next games,” guard Katie Benzan said. “We just need to keep this rhythm and flow to continue our streak.”
As the season rolls out, the team’s defense has been steadily improving. The team is allowing an average of 65.1 points per game and averaging 6.4 steals per game and 3.4 blocks per game.
“We are going to try to keep our same energy,” guard Madeline Raster said. “This  means intensity on defense and getting out in transition.”
In addition to its defense, the team overall is boosting its offensive efficiency.
“The team has improved most on reading each other and applying our own instinct within our sets,” forward Jadyn Bush said. “We look more fluid and play well together.”
The team is averaging 15.4 assists per game, which is slightly higher than last year’s season average of 15.1. The team is also scoring an average of 69.7 points per game, also marginally greater than last year’s 68.3 points per game. With better ball movement, the team is taking better percentage shots. This is evident as its field goal percentage in its last game against Cal State Northridge was 54.7 percent, the first time the side cracked above a 50 percent field goal percentage.
Another common trend seen over the course of the season is the improvement in free throw percentage. While the team is shooting 73.6 percent from the line, the team made all five of its free throws in its last game and made 78.6 percent of its free throws against Jacksonville State.
Quinnipiac, however, will be a tougher opponent than Harvard’s previous competition. The Bobcats, with a record of 3-3, lost to No. 10 Texas by only one point in last Friday’s game, with a final score of 56-55. Quinnipiac is also coming off a win against Ball State in last Sunday’s matchup, with a score of 69-66. Harvard looks to stop Bobcats’ forward Jay Fen as she leads the team in scoring with 14.3 points per game.
Harvard plans to extend its winning momentum despite the tougher adversity.
“I expect the team to build on the success we had last year; we have a lot of experienced players and returning talent. I think we have a good chance of winning the Ivy tournament,” Bush said.
A main part of the success for the team thus far is the impactful coaching staff. Head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith is the winningest head coach in Ivy League history and enters her 37th season as the head coach of Harvard.
“Our coaching staff is incredible,” Raster said. “They work extremely hard and hold us all to really high standards. It obviously starts at the top with Kathy and continues with the entire staff. They really care about you not only as a basketball player, but also as a person.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Crimson will be heading across the country to take on some of the nation’s top competition at the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational. The field features 42 teams, headlined by a strong core of top-caliber programs. No. 2 Ohio State, No. 5 Michigan, No. 6 Missouri, and EIWA conference foe No. 8 Cornell highlight the tournament and should give Harvard an opportunity to compete against the nation’s best.
“It’s super exciting. This is the biggest tournament of the year for us outside of post-season,”  said sophomore Lukus Stricker (133 pounds). “It’s our best chance to go in, give our all against some really talented guys, try to knock off some really big names, and make a name for ourselves.”
Echoing a similar theme, senior Nolan Hellickson (125 pounds) recognizes the weekend as an opportunity to send a message to other competitors, particularly rivals and familiar foes.
“It’s a prime opportunity...to try to make a big statement before the bulk of our dual meet season,” Hellickson said.
The Crimson will be looking to build off of a series of top individual performances from its last meet, the Keystone Classic in Philadelphia, Pa. Six Harvard wrestlers pushed themselves to top-six finishes, with junior Hunter Ladnier (157 pounds) and freshman Joshua Kim (165 pounds) fighting their ways to third-place honors. This pair in particular will look to keep up momentum after a hot start, having compiled top-five finishes in their respective weight classes in consecutive meets.
Outside of these two wrestlers, the Crimson showed a great deal of depth in its attack in Philadelphia, including strong bouts by Stricker and Hellickson.  Going into this weekend, while different weight classes could mean varying dynamics by individual wrestlers, a universal goal will be to stick to the game plan and not let the opponent set the tempo and style.
“I just have to control the pace of the match, dictate my ties, and get to the holds that I want to be in,” Stricker said.“I think if I wrestle with confidence, there’s not really many people out there who should be able to beat me.”
Beyond sticking to individual game plans, another key for Harvard will be to keep the mechanics simple and tune out the fanfare that surrounds a major tournament. With so talent topping each weight class, tunnel vision will be crucial.
“The biggest thing is just taking it one match at a time,” Hellickson said.
Regardless of the result, the weekend should resonate with the Crimson considering the team will not return to the mats until Dec. 29 at the Ken Kraft Midlands Championships.  Realizing that this match could set the tone for a long time, even into the conference season in the new year, the wrestlers will be locked in.
“It would be huge to have a really solid tournament here, carry that energy for the next month through our training, and then carry that into Midlands. This one is really important for us,” Stricker said.
More tangibly, the invitational could have major postseason implications.
“You have a big weekend here, and you’re pretty much set to qualify for NCAAs,” Hellickson said. “I think guys on our team are excited about that, and we all know there’s been a lot of work culminating up to this point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team battles Colgate on Friday night, hoping to eclipse the .500 mark for the first time this season. The Crimson (3-3-2, 1-2-2 ECAC) dropped both games to the Raiders (3-7-1, 1-2-1) last season, mustrering just one goal between the two contests, marking the first time since 2009-2010 that Colgate swept its season series with Harvard.
The Crimson is fresh off an impressive 4-1 victory over then-No. 15 Cornell last Saturday and owns the NCAA's fourth-best goals per game average (3.88). The squad's ability to put the puck in the net suggests that tonight will be a higher-scoring affair than the team's pair of meetings with the Raiders last season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, a 6-1 victory over Colgate on Friday night has many of the same storylines as its win over Cornell last week: co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage lit the lamp, defenseman Adam Fox and forward Casey Dornbach were all over the scoresheet, and goaltender Michael Lackey posted a solid outing.
The visiting Raiders (3-8-1, 1-3-1 ECAC) fell victim to a Crimson squad (4-3-2, 2-2-2) that is beginning to fire on multiple cylinders. Harvard sits above the .500 mark for the first time in the young campaign after picking up two valuable conference standings points in the decisive triumph.
“Some of our key guys stepped up and made some plays,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Zerter-Gossage with two goals and [Adam Fox] with a couple of high-end plays. That was really the difference in the game.”
Harvard entered the middle period with a one-goal lead. The home team’s stars proceeded to take over, putting the game out of reach for Colgate.
Six minutes into the frame, Fox demonstrated his offensive prowess with a silky fake-shot move around a penalty killer before finding twine on a top-corner snipe.
The junior entered Friday’s tilt atop Division I in points per game and assists per game, and his performance against Colgate (1–2—3) only continued his fiery start to the season, bumping these numbers to 2.22 and 1.67, respectively.
A minute later, Zerter-Gossage potted his second goal of the night after his wrist shot from the right circle squeaked through the pads of freshman goaltender Mitch Benson.
The senior is leading by example on the ice, with Friday’s pair of tallies marking the fourth consecutive game in which he has potted the puck. Zerter-Gossage has six scores in those four contests and paces Harvard in goals with eight.
“I’m just getting good bounces and I’ve been in good spots,” Zerter-Gossage said humbly. “Earlier in the season I had some chances, too, that I didn’t capitalize on, and I felt like it was a matter of time. I think putting them in has been good for the confidence and good for getting the team to where we want it to be.”
Raiders coach Don Vaughan replaced Benson (27 min., 4 GA, .800 SV%) with backup Andrew Farrier after the Zerter-Gossage goal, hoping to rally his bench and cut some of the momentum that the Crimson had accrued.
Despite Colgate competing early in the contest, the Crimson’s high-octane second frame tilted the ice significantly, producing a skewed 31-12 shot disparity after 40 minutes. The Raiders’ 13 third-period shots were too little, too late to make a dent in the Harvard lead.
While Lackey (1 GA, .960 SV%) was not heavily tested on Friday evening, the relatively light workload may prove valuable in Saturday’s clash with No. 16 Cornell, as the senior will need a strong showing for Harvard to emerge victorious.
“There were games earlier in the year where we felt like we dictated the play, and the result didn’t quite end up as expected,” Zerter-Gossage said. “When you control the majority of the game and end up with that score that you think you deserve, it feels a lot better.”
The Crimson drew first blood on Friday night, courtesy of Zerter-Gossage. Sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh kept the puck in the offensive zone and fired a wrist shot toward the net from the left point. Benson failed to corral the puck, and Zerter-Gossage buried the rebound on his backhand.
Eight minutes after the senior’s strike, Colgate cashed in on the man-advantage. Senior forward Adam Dauda beat Lackey blocker-side on a wrist shot from the high slot.
A Walsh goal with nine seconds remaining in the first frame stole the lead back for the Crimson as it returned to the locker room after 20 minutes. The tally came on the powerplay, extending Harvard’s man-up goal streak to seven games — the majority of the team’s schedule early on this season.
After Harvard’s three goals with the man-advantage on Friday, the squad has potted multiple powerplay scores in four of its nine games so far this season. The Crimson owns the top powerplay percentage in the country (40.0%) thanks to this early success.
“[The powerplay unit is] moving the puck, and [it’s] using all the options,” coach Donato said. “If you look at it tonight, we scored in different ways…. The key to the powerplay is that everybody is utilized.”
The third period saw Harvard put in two more goals — another man-up strike from freshman center Jack Drury and a redirect from co-captain Michael Floodstrand. By that point, however, the Crimson had skated away with the game.
Harvard freshman forward Casey Dornbach continued to dominate the scoresheet, posting a three-assist game for the second consecutive bout. The Edina, Minn., native now has 15 points (2–13—15) through nine games and sits second in the nation to none other than Fox in assists per game (1.44), while his 1.67 points per game clip is good for third-best in college hockey.
“Casey has been an impact player for us,” Fox lauded. “There were some guys in his class that had a little more hype, but…he’s a pretty smart player, and obviously [has] a lot of skill. It’s good to see him moving the puck.”
The Crimson will skate against the Big Red Saturday night as it attempts to earn its first four-point weekend of the season and likely dethrone Cornell from its ranked status — the Ithaca dwellers dropped their tilt on Friday against Dartmouth.

You may be realizing that you’re not shaping up to be the academic superstar you aspired to be. Maybe your professor didn’t absolutely love the essay you wrote in the 30 minutes before it was due, or maybe you’ve just realized that participation counts for 30% of your grade in the seminar you sleep through. Fear not, though: this is a perfect time to turn your academics around. It’s late enough in the semester that your professor has started to think about who’s going to be getting A’s but not so late that your efforts will be immediately recognized as blatant brown-nosing. So if you’re looking to make sure your professor recognizes your name without a grimace when grades are due, here are a few ideas to get a head start:
Do the readings before you go to office hours
There is no worse feeling than smugly asking some super-insightful question only to be informed that the answer was fully covered in the readings for Week 3. While one really easy way to avoid this awkward situation is to just not go to office hours, you can also benefit from literally just skimming the materials before showing up. You don’t need to do any hard work, either. Just move your eyes over the section headings and make sure you’re asking something vaguely new-ish.
Basic Social Skills
Yes, it’s incredibly unfair for your professor to insist on meeting at 9 a.m. on the Monday after Thanksgiving, but that doesn’t mean you should give into your (totally valid) urges to scowl at the ground for the entire 75 minutes. Just smiling at your professor when you make eye contact — or asking them how their holiday weekend went — can improve their sentiment towards you by a ton. And besides, when they’re deciding final grades, would you rather they think back to the time you complimented their shirt or the time they caught you glaring when you thought they weren’t looking?
Show the TFs Some Love
Being a teaching fellow seems like the literal worst job ever, but you have the power to make it better for them! Showing some interest in your TF beyond which answers they’re allowed to give you for the problem set or how they’re going to be grading next week’s project can have a big impact on their experience and — transitively — your grades. Does your TF perform independent research? What degree are they pursuing? Are they having relationship problems that you can relate to? Now’s the time to take them out for coffee and find out!
Suck Up Creatively
Now that classroom-to-table is out of money, you’re going to have to think of some new venues for feigning interest in your professor’s research. The sky's the limit here: ask them to take a walk with you, schedule a meeting, or offer to pay for their dinner. Or work your “college-student budget” into conversation often enough that they offer to pay (this happens more often than you might think).
No matter whether you’re aiming to get a rec letter or just some decent grades out of this semester, your professor can be one of your biggest supporters and allies. Good luck making some new friends!

Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell — better known as Billie Eilish, an American singer and songwriter — held a concert at the House of Blues in Boston on Nov. 2.
Though she was only 15 years old when she released her debut single “Ocean Eyes,” Eilish soon went viral. She has accumulated over 162 million streams on Spotify alone as of November. Now, at 16, Eilish has released a successful EP named "Don’t Smile at Me"  — and she's earned the title of Apple Music’s newest UpNext Artist.
The Boston concert formed part of her international "1 by 1" tour. Below, relive the evening in photos.


Childish Major, one of the starting acts of the concert and a grammy-nominated rapper and producer, finished his final song by asking concert-goers to make triangles with their hands.


Fans waited for Billie to step on stage and perform. Standing amid the crowd, Aurora and Anika — students from Needham, Massachusetts — said they felt excited to watch Eilish. When asked how long they've been fans of Eilish, the two paused and looked at each other. “We have been fans for a year and a half. Ever since her EP [Don’t Smile at Me album] came out,” one of the sisters said.
The two also noted that they had listened to “Ocean Eyes” but weren’t exactly fans of that particular song — at least, not yet.
Phones shot up into the sky and fans started to scream when Billie finally took the stage.


The stage was adorned with a giant spider — the drummer, Andrew Marshall, sat under the right set of legs and the guitarist (who is also her brother), Finneas O’Connell, played under the left set of legs.
The crowd put up their hands and sang along with Billie. One woman, a mother who was accompanying her two young girls to their first concert, turned around and yelled of Eilish, “She is so young!”
Billie Eilish, dressed in an oversized red shirt, passionately finished one of her hits: “Idontwannabeyouanymore." The spider shone in the blue background.
The lighting intensified as Billie sang loudly and hyped up her fans dancing on the stage.
Billie completed her song by bowing down to her fans. Pink lighting surrounded her as her drummer, Marshall, played the last few, lingering beats.
Eilish and her brother, O’Connell, sang together while he played the guitar. Fans watched intently, smiling. The spider flashed beams of light with each beat.
