After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Contrary to its title, “Marriage Story” is less the story of a marriage and more the chronicle of its painful dissolution. In his tenth feature-length film, Noah Baumbach follows a passionate marriage to its excruciating end — with a bicoastal custody battle and two Sondheim numbers to boot.
While Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) Barber begin the film with voiced-over recitations of each other’s best qualities, ranging from the idiosyncratic to the ethical — she “always knows the right thing to do when it comes to difficult family shit,” while he is “clear about what he wants” — Baumbach quickly recontextualizes these laundry lists as postmortems for long-dormant affections. In the stark, fluorescent light of a divorce counselor’s office, these qualities become far less pertinent than the grievances, of which there are many. Charlie’s affair with the theater manager, for example, casts an uncomfortable shadow on the fact that Nicole gave up a burgeoning acting career in film to support her husband’s ambitions of theater production in New York City — a sacrifice that he regards as mutually agreed upon and she considers involuntary. “I realized I didn’t ever really come alive for myself,” Nicole confides in her divorce lawyer, Nora Fanshaw (an excellently self-possessed Laura Dern). “I was just feeding his aliveness.” When Nicole is offered a television pilot in Los Angeles, she and their young son Henry (Azhy Robertson) head west to rehabilitate Nicole’s film career and begin the process of splitting their family unevenly in half.
As Charlie and Nicole set about disentangling themselves from the life they’ve built together, their attorneys volleying accusations at their clients’ behest, litigation and mounting animosity corrode whatever working relationship once existed between them. There’s a reason people say no one wins in divorce: It’s a competition to see who can lose the least.
To that end, “Marriage Story” conducts the cinematic equivalent of free indirect discourse; by smartly destabilizing audience allegiances, the film revokes the ability to affiliate with either character with any degree of certainty. From Nicole’s perspective, Charlie is a self-absorbed, tortured artist whose professional ambitions come at the expense of the people he loves; from Charlie’s, Nicole is a savvy manipulator who luxuriates in her own victimhood to selfishly resuscitate a long-dead career. It’s crushing to watch these two find newer and more effective ways to hurt each other with every passing minute. Driver and Johansson exchange dialogue with the ease of natural scene partners, picking up each other’s cues gracefully and with the intuition of, well, a married couple. These people know each other, Baumbach insists, and once shared a life together — divorcing each other is no easier than excising an integral part of themselves, a closeness that heightens the stakes of their separation. Charlie and Nicole embody intimacy in its truest form, each knowing the other with such clarity that sudden revelations of unspoken desires do not only undermine years of trust, but self-knowledge and certainty too.
Though Driver and Johansson are consummate professionals, “Marriage Story” occasionally falls prey to that garrulous, stagey quality of mumblecore that, if overburdened by stylization, can feel self-conscious and effortful. Baumbach favors intense close-ups that sometimes gesture to the film as a construct too transparently, imbuing each glassy eye and watery smile with unsettling performativity. (The only exception is the film’s comedic scenes, which are pleasantly disarming in their unexpectedness — the inherent ridiculousness of Charlie trying to maintain decorum in front of a court-mandated psych evaluator while blood gushes out of his sleeve, for instance, or Nicole’s sister awkwardly handing Charlie divorce papers.) Elsewhere, though, you get the sense that Driver and Johansson are experts of their craft who know the heights of their own talent. Both employ a certain theatrical inflection that often feels studied, rather than spontaneous and lived-in. Plotting, or the lack thereof, only exaggerates this problem — the escalations of conflict feel at times unearned, when unclarity of motivation has the opposite effect of estranging these characters from their spectators, rather than endearing them or even comprehensibly rendering their psyches.
As “Marriage Story” enters its third act, though, its increasing staginess begins to register as a deliberate choice, a self-reflexive gesture at its own performativity. A blow-out fight culminates in tearful screaming and dented drywall, followed in quick succession by Charlie’s swelling rendition of “Being Alive” from Sondheim’s “Company,” with little pretense besides taking place at a bar’s open mic night. Surely a film this saturated in the world of theater is aware of its own mounting theatricality. After all, what is marriage if not performance? Nicole is an actress and Charlie a playwright; they know better than anyone that love is no more than a set of gestures, a laundry list of traits that qualify us for affection and a series of acts that eventually comprise an intimate relationship.
Perhaps this is too cynical an interpretation of “Marriage Story,” which discredits love’s endurance while simultaneously identifying it as singularly special. Love is, indeed, a series of gestures, yet somehow it manages to transcend the sum of its parts. In this regard, it’s like great art, for which both Charlie and Nicole sacrifice their marriage, albeit in different ways. If 2016’s “La La Land” exhorted artists to privilege careerism over romance, then “Marriage Story” is its spiritual follow-up: an unwavering gaze at a romance whose sole purpose is producing, and profiting from, art. For Charlie and Nicole, love and art are so intertwined, they are practically interchangeable. Perhaps the greatest tragedy is that they cannot achieve either one together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A breakout performance from first-year guard Annie Stritzel propelled the Crimson to a 53-44 victory over winless Hartford on Friday night as Harvard preserved its undefeated home record.
The Chicago, Ill. native had previously totaled 15 points in her first five games donning the Crimson uniform. She more than doubled that mark tonight, finishing the contest with 17 points on 5-of-8 shooting.
“A goal of mine is to always bring energy no matter what,” Stritzel said. “It’s just kind of fit and flow of the offense today, I was being aggressive and the shots fell so that was nice.”
Seven of the first-year’s points came in a rejuvenating second quarter in which the Crimson (4-2) held the Hawks (0-5) to just two baskets while building up a 15-point lead. Stritzel provided an instant lift for the team off the bench. After drawing a shooting foul and scoring her first two points from the charity stripe, the guard ensuingly broke Harvard’s curse of eight missed attempts from deep with her first triple.
Showing her tenacity on the defensive end, Stritzel also notched a steal and reciprocated with another lay-up, extending the Harvard lead to six at the halfway point of the second frame.
“She’s very selfless, and just finds a way to get things done and she will only get better now that we figured out she has a comfort zone regarding her knee,” said coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who added that Stritzel had just received positive news on her still ongoing recovery of a knee injury.
“It’s been a little crazy, but a good crazy,” added Stritzel on her transition process. “Working out a lot, it’s much different, much stronger, much faster. But as soon as you get settled, the game starts coming to you more.”
Senior Jeannie Boehm was another bright spot in the Crimson offense, cementing her second double-double of the season with a 12-and-12 night. Holding Hartford interior anchor Lawrencia Moten to just six points, Boehm also added four rejections in the low-scoring affair.
“I’ve had a lot of long talks with Kathy [Delaney-Smith] and Mike [Roux] on really focusing on the defensive end and other areas of my game,” Boehm said. “Tonight was just like that on the floor, just really trying to impact the game in any way that I can.”
Harvard held as large as a 22-point lead heading into the final six minutes of play, but saw that margin dwindle to single-digits by the horn. Two Stritzel free throws were the only offensive points in that extended drought as the Hawks’ centerpiece scorer, Jada Lucas, broke through to finish the game with 18 points. Delaney-Smith, outside of Stritzel and Boehm’s performance, acknowledged much work still needs to be done in the maturation of this young and untested team.
“It’s hard for young teams to distinguish between playing too fast as opposed to running fast,” Delaney-Smith said. “So we ran fast and then we weren’t able to slow ourselves down in a new system. And it’s just I’m prepared for it to be ugly for a while, so my main criticism was in the defensive end. I thought we were a very poor marginal defensive team tonight.”
Outside of Lucas, the Hawks saw contributions offensively from sophomores Jordan McLemore Charlette Leurs, who finished with nine and seven points, respectively. Coach Morgan Valley’s side attempted only 13 shots from deep — about a third of the Crimson’s total — but similarly converted at a low 23.1 percent.
Both teams struggled from the field, with near identical results — Hartford finished the night 19-of-61 (31 percent), while Harvard did slightly worse of 19-of-63 (30 percent). Leading team scorer Lola Mullaney had a quiet night with just six points and junior co-captain Rachel Levy, who had a career-high 20 points last weekend against La Salle, shot 1-of-6. Levy did however snatch three of Harvard’s ten steals, matching a career-high.
From the three-point arc, the Crimson launched 35 attempts — a season-high — but converted on just five, three of which came in the second quarter divided amongst Stritzel, Mullaney, and co-captain Mackenzie Barta.
The team began to make some adjustments following a 10-point first quarter, focusing more attention on attacking the paint with greater ferocity. 14 of the Crimson’s first-half points came in the paint, led by Stritzel and sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy’s aggressiveness. Still however, it was on the defensive end and overall decision-making where Coach Delaney-Smith felt more improvement was needed.
“The whole first quarter we didn’t play very good defense stopping the drive,” Delaney-Smith said. “I didn’t feel we were communicating very well, I didn’t think we were using our heads. I thought we were getting up in the grill when this is a team that just wants to drive.”
As the Crimson continues to mesh and improve its form heading into December, both Stritzel and Boehm noted the progress that the team has made in strengthening chemistry and building the foundations for success in Ivy League play.
“The beauty of our team this year is that everyone is so unselfish on the floor,” Boehm said. “I think we had a different high scorer, every single game. And no one really cares about that. There’s no focus on individual stats. We are still refining a couple things in our offense and in our game but I’m feeling really hopeful given the team mentality.”
“The relationships off the court, I think that’s where it starts,” Stritzel added. “It’s not going to transfer to the court unless you really work at it outside the court.”
Harvard will have a quick transition in a schedule that cuts right through the Thanksgiving Break, as the BU Terriers will host the Crimson on Nov. 26 followed by a contest four days later against Quinnipiac.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — In a double-overtime thriller, Yale defeated Harvard in the 136th rendition of The Game, 50-43. With the victory, the Bulldogs claim a half-share of the Ivy League title, sharing the honor with Dartmouth. En route to earn the victory, Yale (9-1, 6-1 Ivy) overcame a 19-point deficit, with 17 consecutive points in the fourth quarter alone.
With 1:28 to play, the Bulldogs recovered an onside kick down only seven points, setting up a game-tying drive. Yale quarterback Kurt Rawlings, the division leader in passing efficiency, touchdowns, yardage, and average yards per game, led the Bulldogs to an Ivy League championship on Saturday afternoon.
He threw two passes for 15 and 14 yards to Mason Tipton and Reed Klubnick, respectively, before rushing for 13 himself. With only 18 seconds to play, the senior found JP Shohfi at the one, who fell into the endzone. With the PAT from Sam Tuckerman, Yale tied the contest at 36.
“We don’t really focus on the scoreboard,” Rawlings said. “I mean knowing how much time is left is important. I just tell them, ‘guys, enjoy these last moments enjoy the moments in the game, just take it all in and have fun, do your job and just have fun.’ Win or lose, I love playing the game with these guys.”
The Crimson (4-6, 2-4) received the ensuing kick and kneeled to send the contest into overtime.
As overtime began, light was scarce and the athletes were competing in near darkness. Fans held up their phones with the flashlights on, seemingly to try and brighten the field. The game ran late due to the return from halftime being delayed as a result of divestment protests.
A group of Harvard students stormed the field, unraveling signs calling for Harvard and Yale’s divestment from fossil fuels. After about an hour, the protestors were finally escorted from the turf. As security led people off individually, the crowd booed and chanted, “Get them off the field.”
“You just deal with the circumstances that you have and just deal with it,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “You don’t make a big issue with your team, it just is what it is.”
Taking possession first in overtime, Crimson junior quarterback Jake Smith found a wide open senior Cody Chrest for the first play from scrimmage. Harvard took a quick post-regulation lead, 43-36.
Rawlings was quick to answer, hitting Shohfi on the Crimson four. Shohfi managed to land one toe on the green turf before flying out of bounds. One play later, Rawlings landed a strike on the slanting Caden Herring, equalizing the contest at 43.
Having defended first, the Bulldogs started with the ball in the second round of overtime. The second play from scrimmage, Rawlings sprinted right and caught an escaping Shohfi, who had slipped behind his coverage man. The completion went for 19 yards and set up a four yard touchdown run from running back Zane Dudek.
 That four-yard sprint would ice the game, as Harvard’s ensuing drive resulted in a turnover on downs. For the final play of the contest, Smith went to wide out BJ Watson on a screen pass. Watson made some defenders miss in his four yard trudge up the field, but landed two yards short of the first down marker. The home crowd erupted and leaked over short walls of the stadium, encircling the victorious team.
“I think these three guys right here are the three greatest to ever play at Yale,” said Yale coach Tony Reno gesturing to Rawlings, Klubnick, and Shohfi. “There are a lot of greats, but in my opinion, in my era, they’re three of the greats. If we put the ball in the quarterback’s hands and let these two go again, good things are going to happen.”
The 50-43 final score represents the highest scoring contest between the teams ever. The only other time the two squads played into extra time was in 2005, when the Crimson completed a triple-overtime victory at the Yale Bowl.
Rawlings, in his final contest as a Bulldog, dominated the team’s offensive performance. He threw for 417 yards and three touchdowns. The veteran also led the team in rushing with 62 yards on the turf and additional touchdown.
Coming into the contest, the Bulldogs had all the momentum. On the heels of five straight wins, and Dartmouth’s loss last week to Cornell, all Yale needed to secure a share of the Ancient Eight crown was a win over the Crimson.
Harvard, on the contrary, entered on the cusp of a four-game skid. Playing for nothing but pride, the Crimson team registered its third most rushing yards ever, carried by a career performance from freshman Aidan Borguet. The first-year finished with four touchdowns on 10 attempts, logging 264 yards. By his fourth score, Borguet was averaging 40.3 yards a give.
As Harvard started the second half, leading 15-3, the offense stuttered and went two plays for only four yards. On the third snap, Smith went to the middle of the field. His pass to Watson was knocked down as Kyle Ellis climbed up Watson’s back in an attempt to knock down the throw. A delayed pass interference flag on Ellis saved the Crimson’s errant drive, resetting the downs and pushing the team 15 more yards up field.
Two plays later, Borguet was given the end-around to the left. Outstepping two Bulldog defenders who knipped at his ankles, Borguet found the corner and subsequently shot upfield. As several more defenders attempted to push the back out of bounds, Borguet kept his feet, tip-toeing down the visiting sideline and sprinting past the scrambling defenders into the endzone, a 59 yard run.
Two Bulldog scores later, on only his fifth run of the game, Borguet was dished the ball and simply outran the defense. Taking the end around to the right, Borguet sprinted 60 yards down the sideline to the Bulldog endzone. At this point, Borguet was averaging 35 yards a give.
Between the two Borguet touchdowns, Yale was quick to reverse the momentum back in its favor. A three-play drive falling one yard short of the fourth down led to a Bulldog punt. As freshman receiver Gavin Sharkey flagged down the ball, he mishandled it, giving possession back to the Bulldogs at the visitors’ 30.
Rawlings tossed a wheel route to Klubnick, who managed to battle his way to the Harvard four-yard line. From there, Dudek made quick work of the short field, sprinting in untouched for the score.
The Crimson failed to get anything going on offense and sent the ball back to Yale after three attempts at a first down. On the Bulldogs’ third down, Rawlings went to his favorite receiver, finding Klubnick again on the left sideline. The play-caller perfectly placed the pass just over the arm of the Harvard defender and Klubnick notched 40 yards on the toss.
Three incomplete passes later, Yale sent out Tuckerman who rang true from 32.
 The Bulldogs scored again after the second Borguet foot race, this time on a read option run from Rawlings. The home team went for the two point conversion, hoping to bring the game within eight points. The pass attempt was knocked down.
Borguet scored once more to start the fourth. Taking the give up the middle, Borguet looked to be swallowed up. The players nearly stopped moving as the freshman burst from the center of the pile for the 67-yard sprint. With the touchdown, Borguet tied the record for the most rushing touchdowns in a Harvard-Yale game. The Crimson would not break the 17-point Bulldog march to overtime.
Harvard’s defense registered four sacks for 34 lost yards while the Bulldogs managed to pull down Smith only twice. Senior Brogan McParland led the effort, registering two sacks and three additional tackles. Junior defensive back Isaiah Wingfield led the front in tackles, pulling eight Yalies to the ground and logging the team’s only interception of Rawlings in a diving pick.
Harvard’s 4-6 overall record represents the first time the team has posted a losing record since 1998. Harvard did not drop a contest this season by more than a single score.
“Stating the obvious, the cruel ending is just so symbolic of the last half of our season,” Murphy said. “You keep thinking somehow the law of averages is somehow going to work itself out. End of the day, great effort by Yale.”
