After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of the Undergraduate Council expressed concerns regarding a new policy that would penalize undergraduates for joining unrecognized single-gender social organizations, emphasizing that the policy did not take into account the wide variety of such groups at Harvard.
University President Drew G. Faust sent an email Friday morning detailing new regulations proposed by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana that would bar undergraduates from the Class of 2021 onward in unrecognized, single-gender organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups or receiving endorsements for certain fellowships.
Several hours after Faust’s message, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 wrote in an email to undergraduates that they supported the College’s “vision of a more open campus,” but raised several reservations with some of the College’s recommendations and called on administrators “to develop a more nuanced policy which includes student voice at every level.”
Rather and Banks questioned the impact the new policy would have on undergraduates, and suggested that student groups may be hurt by a rule barring certain students from serving in leadership positions.
“Vetting of elected members of student government based on affiliation in certain groups is detrimental, and fundamentally opposed, to the vivacity of the democratic process,” Rather and Banks wrote.
Former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 also raised concerns over the effects that the policy may have on students.
“I’m also worried that it could potentially bar many well-meaning and competent individuals from serving in leadership positions, such as in the UC,” Goffard said. He also pointed out that he served as UC Vice President with then-UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, who was a member of the Oak Club, an unrecognized all-male social organization.
In addition, Rather and Banks criticized the timing of the College’s announcement, noting that the recommendations have raised questions “about the future of Harvard” that students “do not have the time and energy to answer,” given that undergraduates are currently taking final exams.
They also called on administrators to recognize distinctions between Greek organizations and final clubs, emphasizing that the structure and missions of fraternities and sororities are often distinct from those of final clubs—which have been the main focus of administrative scrutiny for the better part of the last year. Faust wrote in her email to undergraduates that the College’s definition of “unrecognized single-gender social organizations” would include “final clubs (male and female), fraternities, and sororities” alike.
Goffard expressed similar reservations about Khurana’s recommendations.
“I do think that there’s a distinction between final clubs which operate on a punch basis, where you can only go through with trying to get membership if you are pre-selected, and some of the rush policies that fraternities and sororities use where anyone can at least try to become a member,” Goffard said. “That’s an important nuance. I’m afraid that the policy is too much of a blanket policy.”
“I don’t think it’s striking an appropriate balance between freedom of association… and the College’s desire to pursue their mission,” Elm Yard Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 said.
Goffard also questioned the College’s ability to enforce the policy, noting that it would be difficult for administrators to know which undergraduates are members of unrecognized student groups.
“Membership in single-gender organizations and final clubs are not always publicly known... I don’t exactly know how the College is planning on procuring lists of members in each of these organizations and how they’re going to monitor that,” Goffard said.
“I imagine that will be an issue that plays out prominently,” he added.
Khurana’s letter, attached to Faust’s email, calls for the creation of an “advisory group comprised of faculty, students, and administrators at the College” to implement the new policies. Rather, Banks, and Goffard all emphasized the importance of including a variety of different student voices in the group.
“The creation of such a group is imperative and we appreciate the effort to include students, from all backgrounds at Harvard in the development and refinement of these policies,” Rather and Banks wrote.
Crimson Yard Representative Jack Kelley ’19 called the College’s recommendations “inherently flawed” and urged administrators to allow “students to make their own decisions socially.”
“One's social group does not affect one's ability to lead in a community on campus, and restricting the leadership of on-campus communities could work against the goals of the administration,” Kelley wrote in an emailed statement.
Although a Harvard-wide task force on sexual assault prevention released a report in March suggesting a correlation between sexual assault and participation in final clubs, Goffard noted that he was not convinced that the College’s recommendations would lead to a “large fall in sexual assaults just yet.”
Still, Goffard acknowledged the College’s goals in crafting the policies, and recommended that single-gender organizations transition to become co-ed.
“I do really hope that it prompts many single-gender organizations to go co-ed,” Goffard said. “I think that final clubs and other single-gender social groups that choose to make the decision are really on the right side of history.”
In addition, Rather, Banks, and Goffard emphasized that the College should look beyond gender alone when attempting to address exclusivity on campus, with Rather and Banks writing that “exclusivity is not relegated to gender alone: class, sexual orientation and race still trouble the welfare of our community.”
“Our campus culture and institutions really need to keep up with the times,” Goffard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 11, 2016, at 11:36 a.m.
Single-gender social organizations largely decried a new policy that will bar their members from holding leadership positions and receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
The policy, proposed by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and announced Friday morning by University President Drew G. Faust in an email to undergraduates, will not affect any current undergraduates or even incoming freshmen; the Class of 2021 will be the first to which it will apply. But graduate and undergraduate members of male and female final clubs, sororities, and fraternities expressed disappointment and outrage at the change. Talk of a spontaneous 5 p.m. protest at Massachusetts Hall, where the offices of Faust and other University administrators are located, even surfaced briefly, though the plan was largely abandoned and only a dozen or so undergraduates stood outside the building when Faust left for the day.
Many affiliates of both male and female groups said the policy could disproportionately affect female final clubs and sororities.
“I think it’s going to make it very difficult for female clubs to continue to exist,” said graduate president of the Sablière Ariel Stoddard ’10, who co-wrote an op-ed Wednesday critical of the administration’s dealings with female clubs.
Graduate president of the all-male Fly Club Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78 agreed, saying “the greatest damage will apply to the five women’s final clubs. This will be a tremendous blow to their current undergraduate membership’s ability to recruit and the efforts of their graduate boards to create healthy support networks for Harvard women.”
Undergraduate members of Harvard sororities were also aggrieved by the announcement. Though many declined to comment on the record, a wave of impassioned Facebook posts from sorority members, and, to a lesser extent, from members of female clubs, hit the newsfeeds of undergraduates shortly after Harvard announced its decision. In 2015, the Cambridge Panhellenic Council’s president estimated that 400 women participated in Harvard’s sororities.
Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, the legal chair of the Sablière’s graduate board, questioned Khurana’s stated rationale, which included an extended description of the history of women at Harvard and framed the policy as an important step in Harvard’s institutional evolution.
“[Khurana] positions himself and Harvard as this force for liberal causes and yet there’s no acknowledgments of the views that women here are expressing,” Schraa said. “But it’s also a very odd way of trying to position himself with these heroes from the past and [shows a] blindness to any dissimilarities that might exist between founding Radcliffe in 1894, including women within Harvard in the 1970’s, and the situation here. He doesn’t seem to acknowledge even that there might be differences.”
Stoddard reiterated concerns she expressed in the Sablière op-ed, saying she thought the messages Friday from both Khurana and Faust seemed to take into account none of the women’s clubs concerns about safe transitions to gender neutral policies. Undergraduate women, Stoddard and her colleagues wrote, could become “collateral damage” in hasty transitions that fail to properly consider a woman’s safety.
Like Schraa, Porteus also questioned the framing of the policy, emphasizing that Harvard administrators had previously focused on sexual assault as the central issue of the final clubs.
Porteus said Faust and Khurana’s letters Friday seemed to move away from references to a report from University-wide task force chaired by former Harvard Provost Steven E. Hyman that upbraided final clubs and implied that they were a large contributor to sexual assault on campus. Indeed, Harvard repeatedly presented one statistic to bolster their case against the clubs. The task force report suggested that a woman was “half again more likely to experience sexual assault if she is involved with a Club than the average female Harvard College senior.”
“The Hyman report has simply been the weapon of choice until outside critiques blunted its edge,” said Porteus.  “This has not been about sexual assault and shame on the University administration for having misled the hundreds of members, current members of final clubs, that this issue had anything to do with preventing sexual assault, a concern that everyone shared and earnestly wished to address.”
In an interview Wednesday, Faust defended the sexual assault prevention report; her letter Friday also briefly mentioned the work of the taskforce. Khurana is expected to present additional recommendations regarding the prevention of sexual assault to Faust by the end of the academics year.
Other representatives of male clubs also had harsh words for the newly-announced policy.
In a statement made on behalf of the Porcellian Club, Marcia Horowitz, a Vice President at the public relations firm Rubenstein, wrote that the club was “disappointed with this unfair and punitive decision that attacks Harvard’s own students because they make a choice to freely assemble at unaffiliated, off-campus, private organizations."
This semester, the Porcellian Club was publicly critical of Khurana’s approach to the clubs and commissioned a statistical analysis which charged the University-wide taskforce report of twisting data from a last year's sexual assault climate survey to vilify final clubs.
Porteus said the Fly would not “rule out anything that was within the law and morally and ethically defensible.” Adding their voices to the yearlong debate for the first time, two national parent organizations of Harvard’s fraternities also weighed in on Harvard’s new policy.
Jonathan M. Pierce, media spokesperson for the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, explicitly questioned the legality of Harvard’s policy.
“We will be forwarding this to our legal counsel and be reaching out to our partners at other Greek organizations and other clubs,” Pierce said. “We believe [the regulations are] unfair, likely to be unconstitutional, and we will work to fight it any way we can and we will reach out to others impacted.”
“Fraternities and sororities have been protected as single-gender organizations by law,” Pierce added. “To my knowledge, Harvard is still in the United States so that would apply to them as well.”
Spokesperson for the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity Brandon Weghorst said he thinks “all fraternities and sororities will see this policy as something that sort of unnecessarily punishes students” interested in a Greek experience, though he emphasized that he could only speak for Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Despite condemning the proposal, many groups said they would not tell their members to conceal their affiliation from the College, which plans to appoint a committee of students, faculty, and administrators to enforce the policy.
“We’re not going to encourage future students who wish to join our organization to misrepresent themselves in signed statements,” Porteus said. “We’re not going to do anything to place our future undergrads, potential undergrad members, in that morally compromising position.”
Stoddard said the  Sablière would similarly maintain honesty with the administration.
“We are made up of a membership of very lovely, honest people,” Stoddard said. “There is no thought that we are going to take the position of ‘oh they can’t enforce it.’”
Weghorst expressed similar sentiments, saying “at this time Sigma Alpha Epsilon is not going to question or fight the sanction idea or basically what the policy will be with Harvard.”
While many leaders were critical, at least one alumna of an unrecognized single-gender group, Schuyler H. Daum ’12 of the all-female IC Club, approved of the change.
“I think that there’s probably a lot to work out but generally I think it’s the sort of bold action that the school needed to make to make an affirmative statement about what the values of Harvard College are,” Daum, who is not on the club’s graduate board, said. “There’s a lot to iron out but I think it’s a really exciting new stage in Harvard history.”
Many undergraduate presidents of final clubs and Greek organizations did not respond to or declined request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Late in the third quarter of a tied game against Brown, the No. 2/2 team in the nation, sophomore Morgan Cheek found himself being double-teamed by two Preseason All-Americans. Having played the game of his life up to that point, however, Cheek did not mind.
He split the two defenders, blew by another, and faked the goalie before finally slotting the ball into the back of the net. It was his sixth goal of the night.
More importantly, the scoreboard read 9-8. Harvard had taken its first lead of the game.
With more than a quarter remaining, Cheek wasn’t done. He added three more to finish with a total of nine, in the process tying the all-time Crimson record for most goals in a game and setting the Ivy League tournament record for the same statistic.
On the shoulders of a career night from the sophomore attacker, Harvard (8-7, 3-3 Ivy) earned its most impressive win of the season by overcoming the Bears (14-2, 6-0) on their home turf in Providence, R.I. It needed every single one of Cheek’s goals to pull out the 13-12 victory, as Brown’s top-ranked scoring offense came close to sending the match into overtime with a barrage of shots late in the fourth quarter.
“He [Cheek] had a great week in practice, and he came into the game with a ton of confidence,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “You could see that translate onto the field, with the way he took over the game.”
By holding on for the win over the Bears, Harvard earned a berth in the Ivy League tournament final on Sunday against No. 7/6 Yale. If the Crimson can avenge a 9-8 regular season loss to the Bulldogs and come out on top, it will secure its first tournament championship in school history and earn an automatic berth into the NCAA tournament.
Second-ranked Brown, meanwhile, finds itself out of the tourney despite running the table against conference opponents during the regular season, and outscoring them by an average of 9.5 goals. The Bears will likely still earn a bid to the NCAA tournament based on its performance over the course of the year.
On Friday night, however, Harvard was the team that needed to win to keep its season alive, and it played with a sense of urgency to match the occasion. On a field with the Crimson’s largest senior class in recent memory, as well as the top attacking duo in the country in Brown’s Dylan Molloy and Kylor Bellistri, it was Cheek who shone brightest.
Molloy, a junior, tallied five goals on the night to bring his season total to an NCAA-best 56, while Bellistri, a senior, added four and now has 55 for the year, good for second best in the nation. Cheek entered the matchup with 26 goals, just over half of what each of his Bears counterparts started the game with, but found a way to singlehandedly match their output.
“Morgan performed tonight. An absolute performance,” Harvard co-captain and defender Stephen Jahelka said. “Tonight was a product of a lot of extra hard work he's put in all season. He played with confidence and put the team on his back when we needed him the most.”
Cheek began by scoring the Crimson’s only goal of the first quarter, one that kept the team in the game as Brown came out of the gates fast to take a 3-1 lead. Harvard came back to tie the game in the second quarter, but the Bears finished the half strong to take an 8-5 lead into the intermission.
Needing a big run to save its season, the Crimson responded by scoring five unanswered goals in the third quarter and turning the three-goal deficit into a two-goal advantage.
“The third quarter, we came out and imposed our will on them,” Jahelka said. “We capitalized on a man up opportunity and never looked back from there.”
Crimson sophomore goalie Robert Shaw made several key saves in the third quarter to spur the run, and continued to make timely stops in the fourth.
Freshman face-off specialist James Sullivan also played a big role in protecting his team’s lead. He held his own against Brown senior Will Gural, a first team All-Ivy selection last season, to hold the Bears’ momentum at several points in the final quarter. Though the Bears cut the lead to a single goal twice, Harvard ultimately held on to earn the victory.
“It’s obviously a great win for us, seeing the guys come together for a performance like that,” Wojcik said. “But we have a bigger game coming up on Sunday against another team that’s already beaten us this season, and we have to be up to the challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday night, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (8-7, 3-3 Ivy) rode a record-setting nine-goal performance from sophomore attacker Morgan Cheek to an upset victory over No. 2/2 Brown (14-2, 6-0). With the win, the Crimson has earned a spot in the Ivy League tournament championship game, where it will face off against No. 7/6 Yale. At stake for Harvard is not only its first tourney title, but also a bid to the NCAA tournament. Here are three things to watch:
1) Cheek’s Hot Streak
Cheek has scored 13 goals in his past two games, including a four-goal output against the same Bulldogs defense he will be facing on Sunday. He sits second on the team in both goals and assists, with 35 and 23, respectively. Senior attacker Devin Dwyer leads the Crimson in both categories.
On Friday, Cheek found the back of the net in a variety of situations, including in both man-up and man-down sets. To contain him, Yale has several options to call on. Senior defender Michael Quinn and junior defender Chris Keating were recently named All-Ivy selections, but one will potentially have to be tasked with stopping Dwyer as well unless the Bulldogs play more of a zone set.
2) Crance Capitalizing on His Chance
In bold move for a team that was ranked in the Top-5 nationally at the time, Yale slotted freshman goalie Hoyt Crance into the starting lineup with only a few games remaining in the season. Sophomore Phil Huffard, who started the first ten games, has assumed a backup role as Crance has taken full advantage of his opportunity.
Crance sports a 4-1 record, with his save percentage increasing in each of the past three games. Despite being a freshman, he showed composure in guiding the Bulldogs to a 7-6 victory over Penn in the semifinals of the Ivy tournament.
While Harvard is not known for a high-scoring offense, it has the playmakers to challenge Crance on Sunday. Dwyer and Cheek lead the attack, but the Crimson has a stable of experienced senior attackmen who have all shown abilities to find the net this season.
3) Closing the Game
When Harvard and Yale meet on Sunday, only eight days will have passed since their previous meeting. In that encounter, the Bulldogs rallied from a 8-4 deficit to win, 9-8, as the Crimson lacked a spark on offense in the fourth quarter to hold onto its lead.
Harvard responded well after the letdown with a resolute performance at the end of the game against Brown, but it is to be seen whether the collapse against Yale last weekend will be on the minds of Crimson players if Sunday’s final goes down to the wire.
