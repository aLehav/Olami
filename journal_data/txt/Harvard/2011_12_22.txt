After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith decided to take a gamble.
For 40 minutes, the coach ordered her players to sit back in a tightly-packed defensive zone, daring her athletic opponents from St. John’s to beat the Crimson with their jump shots.
The gamble paid off, as the visiting Red Storm (7-6) shot just 22-of-62 (35.5 percent) from the field and 5-of-15 from beyond the arc. Harvard’s offense did enough on the other side of the floor to secure the victory, as the Crimson (5-5) defeated St. John’s, 63-56, Thursday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We really didn’t cover the three,” said Delaney-Smith, whose squad led for the contest’s final 38 minutes. “We wanted a pack mentality. We wanted to play defense in the gaps, and I thought we did that really, really, well.”
The St. John's duo of Eugeneia McPherson and Shenneika Smith, who entered the contest shooting a combined 42 percent from the field, struggled against the zone, shooting 9-of-25 from the field.
“They’re an athletic, drive-and-kick kind of team,” said sophomore Christine Clark, who finished with 12 points. "That was our number one priority to close the gaps. Our zone did a very good job of talking and closing those gaps up so they couldn’t drive.”
Clark, the Crimson’s leading scorer who entered the game averaging 16.6 points per game, struggled shooting the ball, connecting on 2-of-15 attempts from the field. But Harvard received scoring from other places, as four Crimson players—Clark, junior forwards Emma Golen and Victoria Lippert, and co-captain Brogan Berry—finished with 12 points.
“I think that says it all,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s all about the team effort.”
Despite having an off-shooting night, Clark played a critical role for the Crimson throughout the contest. The 5’11 guard grabbed a team-high nine rebound—five on the offensive glass—and added three steals.
“A lot of players that I’ve coached over the last 40 years generally sort of will get in their own heads and will maybe stop playing a little bit or get down on themselves [if they have a bad shooting performance],” Delaney-Smith said. “The opposite happens with [Clark]. I think she probably even works a little bit harder.”
With the Crimson clinging to a three-point lead with less than 30 seconds in the contest, it was Clark who came up with a critical steal. The sophomore dove to the ground to intercept an errant pass from St. John’s Amber Thompson, and then, from the ground, signaled for a timeout.
“Two of our players got a trap,” Clark recalled. “[Thompson] was definitely in trouble, so I knew she had to pass it out to somebody. Luckily she passed it out to where I thought she was going to, so I just dove on the floor.”
Coming out of the timeout, the Crimson successfully inbounded the ball to Berry, who was sent to the free throw line. The guard knocked down both attempts, sealing the win.
Harvard opened the contest on a tear, jumping out to an early 25-14 lead following a three-pointer from Golen with 8:05 to play. But after knocking down seven of its first nine attempts from the field, the Crimson’s offense went cold, shooting just 5-of-18 the rest of way.
Harvard’s offensive struggles could be attributed in large part to the Red Storm’s switch to a full-court press, which caused early problems for the Crimson.
“They take away the middle, and they’re sort of tempting you to throw over the top and they’re very athletic, so you don’t want to bite on that,” said Delaney-Smith of the St, John’s press, which helped force seven first-half Crimson turnovers. “We put in a new press offense, and, to be honest, we were a little ragged. We didn’t run it as well as I had hoped we would run it.”
Thanks to its press, the Red Storm managed to cut the Crimson’s lead from 11 to three by halftime.
Coming out of the break, Harvard did a better job holding onto the ball, extending its lead back to double digits midway through the second period. The Crimson’s offense hit a dry spell late in contest, but Harvard’s strong defense and poise down the stretch—Harvard shot 17-of-20 from the free throw line—helped the team hang on to the seven-point victory.
“I just loved our poise, [and] I loved our teamwork,” Delaney-Smith said. “We have the tools to do it, but sometimes we panic, and we did not panic [today].”
After suffering losses to Iowa, Providence, and Minnesota, the win over the Big East’s St. John’s marks the Crimson’s first victory over a BCS-conference opponent this season.
“We’ve had the potential to beat all of [the BCS-conference opponents], so to put it all together and get a win feels great,” Clark said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Home-court advantage continues to hold true for the No. 25 Harvard men’s basketball team. The Crimson (10-1) extended its winning streak at Lavietes Pavilion to 20 games Thursday night, taking down Florida Atlantic (4-8), 63-51.
The run is the longest in program history and dates back to the 2009-2010 season, when Harvard fell at home to that year’s eventual Ivy League champion, Cornell, on Feb. 19, 2010.
With the win against the Owls, the Crimson improved to a perfect 3-0 at home so far this season.
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER
Although Harvard eventually took the contest by a comfortable 12-point margin, the game featured eight lead changes and five ties, as key turnovers and missed opportunities nearly derailed the Harvard team.
“I thought we had turnovers that were silly,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “It wasn’t like they were in a full-court press where they created the turnovers. I felt they didn’t pressure us [into turning the ball over.]”
In the first half, Harvard amassed 10 turnovers to FAU’s seven, although the Crimson capitalized on more of its extra chances with 11 points off of opposing giveaways.
Harvard’s 17 turnovers over the course of the game tied the team’s highest number this season. The Crimson gave away the ball as many times in its low-scoring upset of then-No. 22 Florida State at the Battle 4 Atlantis over Thanksgiving.
“We need to be tougher, stronger with the ball ... in particular in the backcourt,” Amaker said. “[Florida Atlantic guard Raymond Taylor] was in pretty much the whole game, and he’s going make you do a lot a lot of things you don’t want to do ... but I was disappointed in our handling back there.”
Although the game was tied at 17 after 10 minutes of play, Harvard outscored its opponent in the back end of the first half to enter the break up by six.
The second half also featured a late but decisive Harvard run. Despite being knotted at 45 with just over seven minutes to play, the Crimson overpowered the Owls in the final minutes of the game, as junior point guard Brandyn Curry started off an 18-6 final run with a pair of made free throws at 7:18. The advantage proved to be a lead the Crimson would not relinquish.
“[FAU is] a tough, physical, defensive team,” Curry said. “They came out trying to kick us in the mouth a little bit. It took us a little while to respond, a little bit longer than we would have liked.”
Although Harvard faced a 12-day interlude between its most recent contests due to reading period and exam week restrictions, the Crimson players maintained that preparation did not play a role in the slow start.
“Everybody is taking exams,” Curry said. “It’s not an excuse. We had really good practices leading up to [this game]. We have to come out and be ready to go. We know we’re getting everybody’s best stuff, but we have to come out better.”
HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS
While Harvard improved its impressive home record, FAU coach Mike Jarvis also found himself at home last night. A native of none other than Cambridge and former standout athlete at Rindge Technical High School, Jarvis returned to his hometown for tonight’s game.
Jarvis—who is currently in his fourth year at the helm of the Owls and 23rd season as a head coach of a Division 1 basketball program—coached at Harvard from 1973-1977, assisting then-coach Tom Sanders of Celtics fame.
After a long stretch of coaching in Massachusetts, Jarvis ventured south in 1990, first to St. Johns and eventually to FAU.
And after coaching his current team to a hard fought loss at the hands of the Crimson, the former Northeastern basketball and baseball standout had nothing but good things to say about the development of Harvard’s program.
“There are more black people in this building and here at Harvard than I’ve seen ever,” Jarvis said. “It’s wonderful to see all the Cambridge people. ... Harvard is reaching out to the community now, which they never did before.”
Although Thursday night’s contest marked the first time the Crimson and the Owls have met on the basketball court, Amaker and Jarvis have experience coaching against each other.
“I’ve coached against Mike before and have a great deal of respect for him,” Amaker said. “I’ve always looked up to him. He’s a great coach, as you all know, and I’ve always admired Mike and his family.”
