After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donning festival-mandated clear backpacks and sunglasses of every assortment, Outside Lands festival-goers danced and sang along as some of the biggest names in music graced the Golden Gate Park’s makeshift stadiums. Here are the first sound bites of the weekend.

Shannon and the ClamsShannon and the Clams are in their element, and rightly so. The garage-punk band’s hometown is Oakland, California, something they shared to the elated cheers of their Bay Area fans on Friday. “The sun has come out,” guitarist Cody Blanchard said, enjoying the brief moment of warmth in the ever-foggy city. Still, it wasn’t much of a guard against the 64 degree temperature, as bassist and lead singer Shannon Shaw noted. “It’s freezing cold and I can’t feel my fingers,” she said later in the concert, but that didn’t stop her or the rest of the band from blessing the crowd with their own (albeit, metaphorical) spot of sunshine. Shannon and the Clams draws their musical influences from classic R&B, 50s doo-wop, 60s surf, and psychedelia, making for a stunning, bright combination that felt like a welcome escape from San Francisco’s moody skies. It was like being transported to a vaguely-defined, definitely-nonexistent, perpetually sunny era when even the infectious songs know how to smile.
That doesn’t mean that Shannon and the Clams is a happy-go-lucky, chirpy, candy-sweet band. If anything, their performance at Outside Lands highlighted their minimalist side. Aside from the small talk about the weather, there wasn’t much conversation with the crowd, nor transitions between songs. Each band member had their stayed behind their respective microphones. (Though, it was still a joy to see Will Sprott, with his tamborine-keyboard combination, rocking out in his own world on his side of the stage, stationary yet electric.) The audience, perhaps mirroring the band’s sedentary state, was dancing in some sort of side-step-sway motion, aside from a group of jubilant teens who were forming a mini mosh pit of their own, gleefully crashing into each other like a game of human pinball.
Shannon and the Clams’ performative strength is more musical than movement-based—they excited the crowd mostly through their songs, putting on a relatively no-fuss show otherwise. When the band hit their set’s stride with “Ozma,” about two-thirds of the way into the show, the side-step-swayers side-step-swayed a little more excitedly, and the mini mosh pit gained a few more participants. Shaw and Blanchard churned out lively riffs and solos while the lights above the stage flashed yellow and blue frantically, trying to keep up with their impressive pace. During “My Man,” audience members bounced to the beat of “I...I...I” and “you...you...you,” clinging onto every new syllable with clear anticipation.

The Mountain GoatsThe Mountain Goats might have picked the perfect song to kick off their set. “Everybody here is beautiful,” they sang from “California Jam.” “That’s just how I feel / And it’s real.” Singer and guitarist John Darnielle ended the song with a little, quick jump—a small move that would quickly become his trademark during the show: two feet in the air for a split second, barely hovering above the ground, a mixture of happiness and surprise manifesting in a wide smile.
Darnielle’s stage character might have been one of the most wonderful parts of the set—not because the Mountain Goats played badly (because they were stellar), but because all of the sheer enthusiasm was infectious, difficult to distract yourself from (aside from the strange sprinkle of water that dripped from the stage’s roof, soaking one unlucky person’s black fedora). At one point, Darnielle put down the guitar and started skipping, sometimes sticking out his arms as if he was pretending to be an airplane.
Wry humor is also part of the appeal of The Mountain Goats, something especially evident on Friday as their playful irony bled from their songs and into their act. “Hope everyone’s having a good time,” Darnielle said. “Here’s a song about death.” Then later: “This is a song about one of history’s most notorious sellouts,” Darnielle said before launching into “Cry For Judas.” One of the most animated moments of the show was when everyone was belting out the lyrics to “This Year.” “I am going to make it through this year / If it kills me,” Darnielle and the crowd sang, culminating into a bizarre moment of euphoria—pure joy over a shared existential crisis.

Perfume GeniusSometimes Perfume Genius danced like nobody was watching: His back faced the crowd, and he crouched, further obscuring his body from view. He mouthed lyrics to himself before one song’s beginning, seemingly unaware of the people in front of him.
Other times, Perfume Genius danced because he knew that somebody—a massive, swaying crowd—was watching. “It looks like he’s doing animal impersonations,” someone said, delighted. Perfume Genius’s moves were sultry, slow, and smooth. He was bending backwards, rolling his body, and pulling the mic cord with him like it was his dance partner. Perfume Genius started his set like this, with dramatic, deliberate languidness, before ending the dance with a simple “Hi.”
“My dog is here. My first show [at Outside Lands] and my dog is attending,” he later shared, before moving into the rest of his set. Perfume Genius commanded the crowd, moving around the stage like he owned it. And he technically did, for an ethereal fifty minutes. It was clear that we were lucky visitors in his world as he let us slip in and out of it, sometimes lost in his own music and sometimes playing along with our antics. (“You’re a queen!” someone shouted. Perfume Genius raised his hand to his ear playfully. “What’d you say?”)
So much of Perfume Genius’s magic is enhanced by the brilliant physicality he imbues into his dancing. But so much of it is also rooted in his voice. “Just like love,” Perfume Genius sang, sounding startlingly clear, airy, glasslike. “Slick, sheen, so bright.” Later, when Perfume Genius sang “Slip Away,” he spun around in a circle, stretching his arms wide for the song brilliant, shimmering feeling of catharsis: “Don't hold back, I want to break free / God is singing through your body / And I'm carried by the sound.”

Carly Rae Jepsen
After fulfilling her Internet-commanded destiny at Chicago’s Lollapalooza last weekend, Carly Rae Jepsen took to the stage at Outside Lands, leaving the inflatable sword, but bringing her bright brand of bubblegum pop with her. She invited her fans along for the journey, playing “Run Away With Me” first with the music video and the song title scrawled in neon text projected behind her. Though because of the stage’s arrangement, her band blocked part of the video, and for those my height and shorter, the screen read “RUN AWAY” instead before switching to a photo of pink flowers after the song’s conclusion.
“Let’s keep spreading the love!” Jepsen yelled to the crowd, tossing her hands in the air, which she did many, many times. Part of Jepsen’s choreography involved a lot of pointing at the sky and pointing at the crowd, which worked as an efficient way to interact with the audience, as sometimes the crowd excitedly pointed back. Jepsen was technically flawless, dancing across the stage with well-trained prowess. It was clear that Jepsen has all the makings of a pop-star, particularly because she embodies somewhat universal, non-specific sentiments. “I started to annoy my friends by talking about all my boy problems,” she said. “Me too! Me too!” someone shouted. Jepsen beckoned her audience to join as she sang “Boy problems, who's got 'em? / I've got 'em too,” waving her arm to the crowd, who waved back in collective motions. “I Really Like You” came next, set to screen projections of bespeckled thumping hearts. It looked like a cross between an “edgy” 2000s screensaver and Roy Lichtenstein pop art.
The crowd was in a frenzy for the song, but they were even more ecstatic when Jepsen played the 2012 hit that catapulted her to fame: “Call Me Maybe.” Hundreds of phones flew into the air, presumably to take videos of this extremely-anticipated moment. But they doubled as a surreal, crowdsourced, prop-based setting. After “Call Me Maybe” ended, hordes of people left. It was a shame, because the next song, “All That,” was one of the highlights of Jepsen’s performance, a more toned-down, but still enrapturing dimension of her persona. If she noticed, she didn’t show it, focusing intently on the song instead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first Hollywood studio film in over 25 years with majority Asian Americans in lead roles, the widely-anticipated “Crazy Rich Asians” has been touted as a harbinger for greater Asian and Asian American representation in Hollywood, as well as criticized for skimping on Asian diversity within its cast. Media coverage has been ecstatic as well as measured, raising the question of whether perfect representation can ever be possible, while incremental cultural progress is practical and still commendable.
Kevin Kwan, author of the best-selling “Crazy Rich Asians” trilogy, and “Crazy Rich Asians” actors Jimmy O. Yang and Gemma Chan sat down in the Boston Harbor Hotel for a roundtable interview about their film, out Aug. 15. Adapted for the screen by Peter Chiarelli and Adele Lim, the story follows Nick Young (Henry Golding) and his girlfriend, Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) a fellow NYU professor (and Chinese-American), to his native Singapore, where they attend his best friend Colin’s (Chris Pang) wedding. There, Rachel learns that Nick is from one of the wealthiest families in all of Asia, must negotiate culture shock, and hold her own against jealous bullies and Nick’s disdainful mother (Michelle Yeoh). Chan plays Astrid Leong, Nick’s cosmopolite cousin, and Yang plays Bernard Tai, a bombastic party boy who orchestrates a bachelor party of unworldly proportions.
For all the attention Kwan lavishes on the glamorous excesses of the elite, Chan noted how familiar emotional arcs ground the story and the characters. “Although this story is a specific story about these characters who happen to be Asian, the themes of it are really very universal: love, friendship, family, relationships, conflicts, the conflict between old and new and different generations,” Chan said. “It excited me that I could feel that that would be something that would resonate and would appeal to… people who weren’t Asian, from whatever background, who ever felt like you didn’t quite fit in, or you’re an outsider—that’s something that would speak to you. And for so long, the universal experience has been assumed to be white.”
Yang also underscored the importance of appraising and enjoying the story as it is and not only for what the film symbolizes politically. “It’s an Asian story, but at the same time it’s a very authentic story. I think that’s why it’s so good, [because] Kevin actually knows these people and has the experiences, so I think it encourages more authentic story-writing. It’s not necessarily pushing, ‘Asian, Asian, Asian,’” Yang said.
The film is more than just a step toward greater racial inclusivity in Hollywood: Kwan also questions traditional gender dynamics and expectations with nuanced portrayals of womanhood. Chan talked about the unassuming emotional complexity of the characters in a world where social decorum regulates self-expression and family reputation means everything. Astrid appears larger-than-life, but her seeming passivity belies an acute self-awareness and inner strength, in keeping with Kwan’s focus on strong, evolving female characters and relationships. “What I love about the film is that by the end, she kind of rediscovers her power and asserts herself,” Chan said. “I think there’s no one way to be a feminist. I think ‘feminist’ just means that you believe in equal rights for men and women and you could embody that in so many different ways. So yeah, I would say that Astrid’s a feminist too.”
The film’s leads have also emphasized the historical implications of such hard-won and unprecedented representation. In a Twitter statement, Wu championed an even greater awareness to diversity in the future, writing, "Before ["Crazy Rich Asians"], I hadn’t even done a tiny part in a studio film. I never dreamed I would get to star in one, because I had never seen that happen to someone who looked like me.”
Wu also wrote, “I know CRA won’t represent every Asian American. So for those of you who don’t feel seen, I hope there is a story you find soon that does represent you.”
Regarding the obstacles he faced in getting his project greenlighted, Kwan revealed that he encountered surprisingly little resistance from Hollywood executives—barring one producer’s suggestion—indicating the potential in the worldwide market for universally compelling stories in all their colorful manifestations. “There was one producer that very famously suggested that we change the lead to a white Reese-Johansson, or something, and I didn’t even entertain that. But every other producer that came was really, truly interested in the idea of this film, because of the story, really. And the story is one that transcends race,” he said.
However, the film has attracted criticism for its lack of ethnic diversity. Fans of Kwan’s novels have taken to social media to both defend Chu’s casting choices and bemoan the film’s relegation of its few darker-skinned Asian actors to subservient roles. “As much as I'm excited for #CrazyRichAsians, I also wonder why isn't there any browns (esp. South Asians & Southeast Asians) in the movie? Are we not Asian? It's more like #CrazyRichMongoloids,” one Twitter user said. “The book is aware of its lack of minority representation and actually alludes to the closed minded attitude of some social circles in Singapore. One of the family members got disowned for marrying a Malay,” another wrote. When asked about the film’s portrayal of racial tensions between Asians of different social classes, as well as tensions between Chinese and Chinese-American people, Kwan said, “I think we don’t bury it. We make it quite blatant.”
Others involved with the film have dealt with pushback related to race in the casting process. The half-white, half-Malaysian Golding, after facing criticism about not “being Asian enough” to play Nick, made a plea for solidarity in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. He said, “For me, it was almost like being kind of stabbed in the back. I was like, ‘Aren't we meant to be in this boat together? Aren't we meant to strive together for something bigger than these boundaries that we're putting on ourselves instead of bullying each other?’”
Yang appreciates the cast’s diversity of dialects, having worked with Chu on affecting Bernard’s unique accent, which he classifies as “street Hong Kong-ish.” “The most frustrating part is like, say, if somebody, an American actor, say Brad Pitt’s doing a British accent… If he does it well, we’re like ‘Oh, that’s art… We couldn’t even tell he was American.’ But when an Asian person does like a really authentic Mandarin accent, or a Cantonese accent, you’re like ‘Ugh, ugh! He’s misrepresenting, or whatever,’” Yang said. He pointed to the various accents in the film—Ronny Chieng and his Malay accent, the Singaporean accents, and Chan’s British accent—as comprising a spectrum of Asianness that the actors portray on their own terms. “Hopefully with this movie the liberating part is people are able to judge our performances and judge cinematically how good or bad it is instead of trying to only see it as, ‘Oh, are they good Asians or bad Asians?’ How about, are we good filmmakers or bad filmmakers? Good actors or bad actors?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is an ongoing food diary. Stay tuned for updates.
No other music festival hypes up food like San Francisco’s Outside Lands does, because no other music festival devotes exorbitant amounts of square footage of the Golden Gate park to food like Outside Lands does. There are specific “lands” dedicated to beer, cheese, wine, and grass (read: cannabis). There’s even a perpetual bubble tea party.
But this specific food review will focus on the more traditional means of finding lunch at a festival. Throughout the weekend, we’ll be visiting the best and the worst of Outside Lands’ food tents, starting with a Bay Area classic:

Steap Tea BarOkay, disclaimer: Steap Tea Bar isn’t in the trail of vendors lining the festival. It’s in the aforementioned, never-ending bubble tea party, tucked away in the woods. It calls itself “not your average tea shop,” using premium teas that their website claims would retail for “about $100 a pound.” They also say they use local organic milks and sugars, and make their boba in-house, daily. Do their high quality ingredients make a difference—once that’s worth the steep boba price?
The answer is a flat no. At Outside Lands, one matcha latte with boba costs $9, as do the rest of their music festival offerings: taro milk with boba and hibiscus punch with aloe. The same drinks cost around $5 to $6 once you step outside of the Golden Gate Park’s gates, so unless you desperately need that caffeine to kickstart your day, bring water instead. That doesn’t mean the milk tea isn’t good, because it is. The default milk choice (at least when I went) was almond, which didn't overwhelm the drink with its almond flavor, and also prevented the undesirable filmy aftermath of other dairy-based drinks. The matcha was standard—grassy, rich, and bitter. The drink just isn’t $9 good. It’s hard for a non-alcoholic beverage to be $9 good.
Bonus: The drink came with a compostable straw. Not a bonus: Tapioca pearls kept getting stuck in said compostable straw, which was less the straw’s fault and more the bubbles’ gooeyness. Other than the five or so times I had to unclog the drink, the pearls were great, with just the right chewy consistency.

KoJa Kitchen“KoJa” is short for Korean-Japanese. This Bay Area favorite normally serves an eclectic variety of Korean-Japanese fusion food: burgers, tacos, bowls, and salads. But for Outside Lands, KoJa decided to focus on their popular side dish instead: “kamikaze fries.” It consists of waffle-cut fries buried in minced bulgogi (Korean barbecue beef), kimchi, red sauce, Japanese mayonnaise, and green onions. It’s a lot of topping for some plain waffles fries to handle, but they do so anyway, acting as the perfect vehicle for all the lightly spicy, tangy sweetness on top. The bulgogi has a fatty flavor that rounds out the sharpness from the kimchi, and the simple potato fries aren’t seasoned as far as I can tell, which works to the side dish’s advantage, preventing the already busy flavors from becoming overwhelming.
It’s a shame then—and really, truly perplexing—why these fries were cursed with such a disturbing, terrible name. The business explained its reasoning on Yelp: “Kamikaze fries! Why the name, you ask? Because it's killer delicious!” But their poor rationale and insensitive wordplay somehow sours the $14 fries’s aftertaste.
