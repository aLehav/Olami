After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like every organization at Harvard, the Bureau of Study Counsel has to trim costs. And given that tutoring fees haven’t gone up in more than a decade, raising tutors’ prices seems a sensible move. Therefore, we support the BSC’s decision to save money in a way that will not diminish the services it provides by upping its tuition rates from $4 to $7 per hour (while the rate increases to $14 per hour after the first 10 hours, apparently fewer than a quarter of tutoring requests fall into this category). Critical to our support of the increase, however, is the continued role of the Financial Aid Office, which will continue to assist students in need.
Even with the small increase, BSC tutoring rates will remain quite reasonable. Fees of $7 per hour would be a steal in commercial tutoring. The service will retain affordable prices while at the same time preserving its financial solvency and avoiding the need for cutbacks. 
However, the BCS could do more to raise its profile and spread awareness of this service as an option for struggling students. With tutoring costing up to hundreds of dollars per hour outside Harvard, students should consider using BSC’s tutoring service more, even after the price hike. We also recognize the variety of free resources available to students—teaching fellows, professors, and friends can all provide help to students, too.
Just as we hope more people consider the tutoring service, we also urge students to think about becoming tutors themselves. Some students may stay away from doing so because they consider themselves unqualified for the job. However, sometimes the best tutors are those who paid the best attention, or even struggled themselves, and can empathize with their pupils. To be a good tutor, one does not need to have aced a class. We hope that the price increases ensure the continued financial health of the program, encouraging more participants in the future.

In yesterday’s newspaper, The Crimson ran an advertisement that questioned whether the Holocaust occurred and which unsurprisingly angered many members of the Harvard community. We did not intend to run the ad—a decision we made over the summer when it was initially submitted. Unfortunately, with three weeks of vacation between submission and publication, that decision fell through the cracks.
Yesterday’s advertisement was the result of that miscommunication. And while running the ad was not our intent, we accept responsibility for our failure to carry out the planned cancellation. We recognize how sensitive a subject this is for our community and appreciate all the e-mails and letters we have received about it from concerned members of the University. We have made sure that the rest of the ad’s planned run has been terminated, and any money that has changed hands in exchange for the ad to date will be returned.
We want to stress that we do not endorse the views put forth in any advertisement that runs in The Crimson, and this case was no different. That said, we do recognize that in our role as distributors we are responsible for the content that runs in our newspaper. And though we did seek to intervene in this case, we failed to see the process through to its conclusion. We will work hard to avoid such lapses in communication in the future, and hope our readers will accept that yesterday’s error was a logistical failure and not a philosophical one.
Sincerely,

In Tuesday’s Crimson, an advertisement was published that questioned the occurrence of the Holocaust. Understandably, the advertisement offended large segments of the campus. 
While the damage has most certainly been done, and hopefully minimized, it should be said that The Crimson did not intend to run the advertisement and that its appearance was nothing more than a communication mistake. We appreciate Crimson President Maxwell L. Child ’10’s letter to our readership in yesterday’s paper. May his words make clear that the advertisement in no way reflects the views of The Crimson Staff. And moreover, that we believe this item should never be found in the pages of a college newspaper.
Although newspapers command the right to publish whatever they see fit—a right that should not be infringed upon—it remains a journalistic responsibility to carefully evaluate what is actually appropriate to print. Officially, a college newspaper such as ours retains the legal right to print whatever it so chooses, with the understanding, of course, that anyone might be sued for defamation. But whether incendiary material of this sort should actually appear in print is a different question altogether, albeit with a simple answer in this case. Can The Crimson publish an advertisement like Tuesday’s? 
Absolutely. But should it? Absolutely not.
The reason that an advertisement promoting Holocaust denial was inappropriate is not merely that it offended many on campus but rather that it contradicted our values in serving a diverse and welcoming university community. After all, content that some find offensive is often acceptable, and the angry reader is an inevitable element in the production and consumption of journalism. As a newspaper devoted to the highest standards of journalistic integrity, The Crimson does not often shy away from offending readers who take umbrage at its content. But Tuesday’s advertisement was a different story. It was more than just “offensive” to some readers—it was wrong. 
Instead of simply offending, Holocaust denial has much graver effects. It promotes hate and could actually jeopardize the psychological and emotional well being of others in the Harvard community. 
While Holocaust survivors are often traumatized for life as a result of the horrors they have endured, it is a well-known fact that their children and even their grandchildren also frequently suffer bouts of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression. Denial of the Holocaust can trigger such terrible episodes in those who must deal with its memory on a daily basis. Tuesday’s advertisement, though the result of a mistake, was inappropriate for its potential to reopen the wounds of the past for the victims of the present.
We hope to see The Crimson and other college newspapers refrain from printing similar content going forward.

Nearly everyone has at some point in his or her life experienced hunger. I’m not referring to genuine, involuntary starvation—a real concern in many parts of the world—but rather something along the lines of the pre-Sunday brunch munchies, when an unpleasantly grumbling stomach signals anticipation for that bite of Veritaffles at noon.
Few people, however, seek out the feeling of hunger on purpose. For the past 20 days, hundreds of Muslims on campus, including myself, have done precisely that—deliberately shunned food and drink from sunrise to sunset in observance of the Islamic month of Ramadan. 
It’s all done for good reason. Fasting has great spiritual importance in Islam; a blindingly vast corpus of religious tradition, scholarship, and run-of-the-mill ritual accompanies the month of Ramadan. Leaving all of that aside, however, fasting also offers important secular lessons. Whether or not one is religiously inclined, it offers considerable personal benefits. Few other methods are so effective in teaching discipline and humility coupled with an awe and respect for the human spirit. Islamic virtues, yes—but hardly exclusively so. 
The virtue of “self-discipline” is perhaps most obvious. Without doubt, it takes some degree of control to avoid sneaking a Coconut Congo Bar after 11 hours of not eating. However, the benefits of discipline in this context trickle down to multiple aspects of our lives. Speaking personally, it has helped me overcome the urge to open a new Gchat window every 45 seconds or so.
But fasting can lead to profound self-reflection as well. Those few hours before the sun sets and one is allowed to eat are precisely the time in which one realizes just how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The idea that all it takes is a candy bar to bring a man to his knees is a supremely humbling idea. This weakness rightly serves to remind us of how fragile we are as individuals. 
At the same time, fasting also provides a fascinating form of reassurance, if only because our discomfort is self-imposed. As such, we can readily take it away, but yet choose not to. It is this ability to make such a choice that defines who we are as human beings. Indeed, what other creature acts in a manner that initially seems so detrimental to its own well-being, with the sole purpose of achieving a higher, perhaps not readily comprehensible goal?
Therefore, I ask all Harvard students to consider fasting—not as an experiment on religious grounds, but rather to improve as a person and learn something about oneself along the way. Tomorrow, skip the scalloped potatoes and reflect a little instead.

As a vice president for policy and government affairs at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, I have debated animal protection issues around the world, frequently engaging with representatives from the meat, fur, animal-experimentation and circus industries.
But a strange thing started happening about seven or eight years ago: the other side stopped showing up. Although PETA is always happy to discuss and debate animal rights issues, the animal exploiters are no longer willing to. I believe this newfound timidity may have something to do with the fact that their positions are so transparently indefensible and that the public can see right through them.
For example, prior to a recent speech I gave at Michigan State University, representatives from MSU’s student animal rights organization attempted to arrange a forum that would include Jeff Armstrong, dean of the MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and myself. I was prepared to argue that animal use is not necessary and that modern slaughter methods and factory farm confinement practices are cruel. As chair of the United Egg Producers Animal Welfare Advisory Committee and as an adviser to McDonald’s on animal welfare issues, Armstrong would have undoubtedly taken the opposing view. Considering that he lends his name and prestige (and his MSU affiliation) to these methods and practices, he seemed to be the ideal advocate for those who support animal use. Sadly, Armstrong flatly refused to participate.
More and more students are discovering that animals—cows, turkeys, pigs and chickens—living on factory farms and dying in slaughterhouses face abuses so severe that they could warrant felony cruelty-to-animals charges were dogs or cats the victims. McDonald’s suppliers cram mother pigs into crates that are too small for them to turn around in, cram hens into tiny cages that cause their muscles and bones to waste away from lack of use, and kill chickens using a method that guarantees that every year millions of birds will still be conscious when they are immersed in the scalding-hot water of defeathering tanks. Every year, billions of chickens have their throats cut while they are still conscious, and PETA investigations have proved repeatedly that sadistic abuse on the part of workers is the norm, not the exception.
Taking this into consideration, it’s understandable that representatives of the meat and egg industries would refuse to hold an open forum, but if researchers such as Armstrong believe they are doing honorable work, it is less clear to me why they would refuse to participate. 
Thankfully, there is still a thirst among students for active discussion on these important issues. When the Harvard College Vegetarian Society reached out to the campus Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society about organizing a debate between the society and me on the ethical issues surrounding meat consumption, to their credit, the students jumped at the opportunity. They recognize that there is no harm in allowing students and faculty to see both sides of the issue so that they can develop a more informed stance.

To the editors:

The Jewish people have a “tragic history that cannot be denied. Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust. […] Jews were enslaved, tortured, shot and gassed to death by the Third Reich.  Six million Jews were killed—more than the entire Jewish population of Israel today.  Denying that fact is baseless, it is ignorant, and it is hateful.” These powerful and courageous words were spoken by President Barack Obama on June 4th, in his landmark address to the Muslim world from Cairo, Egypt. Yesterday, here in Cambridge, the Harvard Crimson chose to grant a platform to those “hateful” voices so strongly condemned by our President. 
On the bottom of page A7 of its September 8th, 2009 issue, The Crimson ran an ad questioning the truth of the Holocaust. In it, Bradley Smith, the founder of an organization which calls itself the “Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust,” asked readers if they could “provide, with proof, the name of one person killed in a gas chamber at Auschwitz.” 
As Harvard students, many of us members of The Crimson’s various departments, and all of us with an abiding respect for the paper’s staff and its institutions, we were shocked and pained by this immoral subversion of our own publication of record. Some of us are the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors and were deeply hurt by the implication that those stories passed on to us of our past—of lives lost and families destroyed—were all lies concocted by a vast Jewish conspiracy. Like President Obama, we can view such “baseless” sentiments with nothing but revulsion. That the Harvard Crimson would choose to fund its activities with money garnered from the promotion of such hateful, willful ignorance shames its good name.
Doubtless this was a late night oversight made under the pressure of impending deadlines. But it was a grave error nonetheless, and one that demands correction. As Americans, we must practice what we preach—what was true in Cairo is true in Cambridge. We—as fellow staff, students and human beings - ask that you please set the record straight for the Crimson’s readership and issue an appropriate apology for the hurt inadvertently caused to so many.

I was very disappointed to see this morning The Crimson try to weasel its way out of apologizing to the Harvard community for yesterday’s ad. While it is good to know that the ad was not intended to run, that doesn’t erase the offense and hurt caused to many students and other readers by its publication. For that, regardless of intent, The Crimson should apologize. And please, without trying to dance around the word “sorry.”

The September 2 opinion piece “Old King Coal” (Op-ed, ANTHONY P. DEDOUSIS) contained errors about the impact of the ash spill at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston Fossil Plant. TVA is responsible for the spill and its clean-up, and we would like your readers to have the facts:
Of the 300 acres of land and water covered by the spilled ash, all but eight acres are part of the plant and reservoir property managed by TVA. Three homes were structurally damaged. TVA is dredging the river to remove the ash as quickly as possible and will work with the community to develop a long-term plan for disposition of the remaining ash.
While no exact account of effects on wildlife is possible, about 200 fish were stranded by the spill’s initial surge; many other smaller organisms, including bottom-dwellers, were likely impacted by the ash. However, no evidence supports the numbers in your opinion piece.
Also contrary to statements there, public and private drinking water supplies in the area continue to meet government standards for drinking water quality.
Fly ash contains small amounts of toxic substances—about the same as well-fertilized garden soil. According to health officials, the major risks to human health are irritation from breathing the ash or handling the ash, which can be minimized by avoiding contact with the material and washing exposed skin and clothing.
TVA continues to comply with the regulations that govern ash storage, and we will comply with any future regulations. We have identified the root causes of the spill and are taking action to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.
Please let us know whenever you need information about TVA or its operations. We do our best to respond to media inquiries quickly and accurately.

With the grand opening of BoYo (“Bo”ston “Yo”gurt) in May, a third Berryline location flourishing in Fenway, and South Korean frozen dessert chain Red Mango set to open its first Boston location this fall, tangy frozen yogurt competition in Beantown has seen an uptick of late. And for at least one yogurt peddler, no time of year is busier than the beginning of a new fall semester.Whitney Chicoine, who has worked at Berryline’s Fenway location since its opening in June, said she noticed that the business began taking off at the end of the summer after college students returned from vacation.“I’ve seen Fenway get a lot more popular in the past week,” she said. “With more people coming back to school, I think we’ll see a lot more customers.”Christopher Saenz, who manages Berryline’s Harvard Square location and has worked there since Berryline first opened in September, 2007, said that the store’s busiest time is in the evenings after local families and college students have dinner.“Things are crazy after eight,” he said.But even with Berryline business pouring in, the familiar frozen yogurt dessert joint is far from being able to claim a monopoly on the frozen yogurt front.  National frozen yogurt chains such as Red Mango and Pinkberry carry similar tasting yogurts and fresh fruit toppings. All three companies, capitalizing on a wave of enthusiasm for trendy, low-calorie alternatives to traditional soft-serve, are looking for ways to advance their brand—and their service—in a crowded market. Berryline’s three locations currently offer three flavors at any one time, allowing customers to choose from an “original” and two specialty flavors, such as guava or banana. When Red Mango opens in downtown Boston as early as next month, it too will boast specialty flavors. Back Bay resident Brittany J. Hartman, whose workplace is across the street from Berryline’s Harvard Square location, says she makes several trips per week specifically for the Cambridge-born frozen yogurt chain’s wares.“I love the yogurt and the fresh fruit, and the fun art here and the friendly staff,” she said. But Alexander F. Bagley, a second-year student at Harvard Medical School and a tutor in Winthrop House, was less enthusiastic about the frozen treat. “This is my third time here and it was great the first time, but it’s been tailing off,” he said. “They need to change things up and add greater variety.”Despite the variety of yogurt options already available in Boston, there has been word that other players might be looking to make their way onto the crowded frozen treat landscape. According to a recent article in the Boston Globe, Mayor Thomas M. Menino has met with California-based frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry, which is rumored to be looking into locations in Back Bay, Downtown Crossing, and Fenway.—Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz sought to explain why the Jewish-American community should not doubt President Barack Obama’s support for Israel in a debate with his former student that evolved into a discussion of both policy and politics at Harvard Hillel last night.Before an audience of over 100 people—many of them members of the Hillel community—Dershowitz reaffirmed his support for Obama despite mixed rhetoric from the White House on America’s approach to Israel-Palestine relations and the subsequent backlash from the American Jewish community, which voted overwhelmingly for the then-Illinois senator.Taking a more critical stance, Joel B. Pollak ’99, who graduated from the Law School in 2009 and is running for Congress in the 9th district of Illinois, called upon the Jewish community to “hold the Obama administration and Congress accountable” for recent Middle East policy including a much-publicized speech in Cairo, a delayed show of support for protestors after the presidential elections in Iran, and sustained pressure on Israel to halt settlements in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Pollak gained brief media attention last spring when he took Mass. Representative Barney Frank to task during a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School. “It is a true test of our ability as citizens to engage in democracy,” Pollak said. “Many Jewish-Americans voted for Obama, and now they suspect they were victims of a bait and switch.”Dershowitz, a vocal defender of Israel and a long-time supporter of a sovereign Palestinian state, responded that he would continue to support the president on policy stances he agreed with, and would otherwise prefer to work constructively within the Democratic Party. But Dershowitz has also spoken out vigorously against Democratic officials in the past, notably attacking former President Jimmy Carter’s portrayal of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Obama’s willingness to engage in dialogue with Iran and other Middle Eastern countries has been a positive aspect of the administration, Dershowitz said, and his credibility with liberals and young people makes him a stronger advocate for Israel as well.“I think it’s much better for Israel to have a supporter in the White House like Obama, a critical supporter, than to have yet another old white conservative man who’s Republican,” he said. “That’s expected.”Several students in the audience said they enjoyed the event, organized by Harvard Students for Israel, although it remained a discussion between two supporters of Israel rather than the debate as advertised.“It was very honest, and didn’t seem like anyone had an agenda beyond bringing the facts forward,” said Arun A. Viswanath ’13, who studied in the West Bank before coming to Harvard. “Both have the same interest in mind.”Ari R. Hoffman ’11 said he appreciated the passionate but cordial dialogue that stayed focused on the substantive issues of American policy in the Middle East.“It was good to see such opposite ends of the political spectrum unite around the love of Israel,” he said.—Staff writer Athena Y.

Congressman Michael E. Capuano, a Somerville Democrat whose U.S. House district includes Cambridge, obtained nomination papers yesterday to run for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant after the death of Edward M. Kennedy.“I believe that the voters of Massachusetts want to continue the progressive ideals that Senator Ted Kennedy fought for during his decades of service,” Capuano said, according to the Boston Globe. “No other candidate being mentioned or already announced more closely mirrors Ted Kennedy’s position on important issues of war and peace.” Capuano said obtaining papers was “the next step towards making a decision regarding candidacy,” and added that he would make a formal announcement next week.Taking out nomination papers, the first major step towards launching a Senate run, requires potential candidates to obtain voter signatures. Two other Democrats, Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley and U.S. Representative Stephen Lynch, have taken out nomination papers as well. Former Lieutenant Gov. Kerry M. Healey ’82, a prominent Mass. Republican, had also considered entering the race but decided against it on Sunday night, saying that such a campaign “would not be in the best interest of [her] family at this time.” Nomination papers for party candidates must be submitted for certification of signatures by Oct. 20, and the special election filling Kennedy’s Senate seat will take place on Jan. 19. State party primaries will be held on Dec. 8. In the meantime, state lawmakers are considering whether to allow Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 to make an interim appointment to the Senate.Capuano, who spent his undergraduate years at Dartmouth and earned a law degree at Boston College, served as Mayor of Somerville for nearly a decade before being elected to the House in 1998. That House seat had previously been filled by Ted Kennedy’s nephew Joseph P. Kennedy II, who recently also debated running for his late uncle’s Senate seat. But Kennedy announced Sunday that he would be staying in the private sector—a move that opened up the field for other contenders, including Capuano.Alison Mills, Capuano’s spokeswoman, did not respond to requests for comment yesterday. —Staff writer Peter F.

Professor Michael J. Sandel—who teaches the popular Moral Reasoning course on the subject—explained his philosophy about justice as argued in his new book, “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” at a packed panel discussion with three political experts at the Institute of Politics Forum last night. Sandel explained the three basic schools of thought behind justice, succinctly represented by the words “Utility”—seeking the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people; “Consent”—respecting the rights and freedoms of individuals; and “Virtue”—promoting virtue through government and law.Using examples from hotly-debated political issues such as universal healthcare, the Wall Street bailout, and same-sex marriage, Sandel argued that  most of society’s debates—though they seem to hinge on questions of maximizing happiness and respecting individual freedoms—are really “debates about what virtues...should government, law, and public policy embody, encourage, and express.” “Politics and law can’t be neutral to the moral and religious convictions that citizens care about,” Sandel said. “[That would] lead to a kind of emptiness in our politics.” The discussion then turned to the panelists, who challenged Sandel on various aspects of his philosophy. Professor Niall C.D. Ferguson said he didn’t think he would “ever be enthusiastic about virtue,” saying that the word had Robespierrian connotations of “sending people to the guillotine.” Former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan and current Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy E. Noonan commented on the gap between abstract philosophy and practicality in politics. Politicians “have to make decisions in real time, decisions based essentially on practical calculations,” Noonan said. “It’s not abstract for them.” Harvard Law School Professor Lani Guinier ’71 challenged Sandel to more concretely define the meaning of “virtue,” which she felt did not accurately represent his viewpoints. She also argued that “any commitment to justice has to take into account the historical forces in which people are living.” Audience members also had their own challenges to Sandel’s ideas in a question-and-answer session. Rima Merhi, a fellow at the HKS Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, said after the talk that the panel did not spend enough time discussing implementation of justice and the relationship between justice and politics. “I really feel so many people don’t understand what injustice is. They live in the developed world and write to an American audience,”  Merhi said. “They don’t really relate to examples where we really need answers, like in the Middle East and developing countries.”—Staff writer Melody Y.

Shortly after pulling a policy perceived as being a limitation on student interaction with the media, Harvard Medical School administrators have agreed to revise the policy with student input, school officials announced yesterday.
Following news reports highlighting the policy’s wording—which some students criticized as an infringement on their freedom of speech—the school’s Dean for Medical Education Jules L. Dienstag sent out an e-mail to the student body stating that all students are “absolutely free to speak with members of the media about anything they wish.”
“It is vitally important that you know the guideline for interaction with media was never intended to limit anyone’s freedom of speech,” Dienstag wrote in the e-mail.
Dienstag, along with a handful of Medical School administrators, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with four medical school students to discuss the policy’s intent.
Stunned by student reaction to the policy, administrators said that the policy was originally designed to “ensure that students are sensitive to issues that relate to the patient perspective,” especially in protecting patient confidentiality, Dienstag said.
The original policy reads: “All interactions between students and the media should be coordinated with the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of Public Affairs. This applies to situations in which students are contacted by the media as well as instances in which students may be seeking publicity about a student-related project or program.”
That guideline was pulled from the electronic version of the student handbook last week, and the four students present at yesterday’s meeting plan to draft a revised version of the guideline within the next week or so.
“The goal is to ensure that [the revised policy] unambiguously expresses the original intent of offering students resources as they learn to navigate the patient-doctor relationship,” said Dean for Students Nancy E. Oriol in a statement.
After the policy came under fire for its perceived restriction on freedom of speech, the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Massachusetts contacted school officials to discuss the policy. Long an advocate of the freedom of expression on university campuses, the ACLU Foundation of Massachusetts wrote a letter to Clark University in Worcester last spring, urging university officials to reconsider a decision to cancel a talk by controversial political scientist Norman G. Finkelstein.
“Our focus in this case is to preserve the right to freedom of academic expression,” said ACLU staff attorney Sarah Wunsch. 
Though freedom of speech cannot legally be enforced at a private institution such as Harvard, University officials have an obligation to apply and protect the same principles in an academic setting, Wunsch said.
“We’re watching to see what happens,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students returning to campus this fall found it more difficult than usual to quench their thirst for alcoholic beverages.The reason? Harvard’s calendar reform, which started classes a few weeks earlier than usual and left primary campus liquor providers C’est Bon Convenience and Doma Liquors caught off guard by the early return of students at the end of last month and unable to fully meet the demands of the student body.“Usually, Harvard students come here mid-September,” said Subash Khadka, an employee at Doma. “We really didn’t know much about the calendar change, so we ran out—but not empty-empty.”Khadka pointed to the sparsely-stocked shelves, evidence of a welcome boost in sales over the long Labor Day weekend. He had just finished placing an order for more liquor. “The summer is slow for us, since most of our customers are students,” Khadka explained.He estimated that Doma orders twice as much alcohol per week during the school year than in the summer.C’est Bon faced similar difficulties in providing enough alcohol for its customers this weekend.“We were low this weekend, we were very busy,” said Radwan Kheireddine, the store’s owner. “We’re definitely putting in more orders this week.”Kheireddine said that he had heard rumors about a calendar change from Harvard employees who frequent the store but did not realize that the majority of students would be back before Labor Day.“We want students to come, we wish they were here year-round,” Kheireddine said.The temporary shortage of cheap alcohol did not go unnoticed by Harvard students.One Quadling even offered to buy liquor off of others over a House e-mail list. (The transaction was later declared successful.)Billy P. Hennrikus ’11, an Adams House resident, recalled his disappointment at finding both C’est Bon and Doma completely bereft of “cheap beer” sold in large quantities on his first weekend at Harvard.He and his friends eventually went to Louie’s Superette to procure their alcohol, though the store did not carry “30s.”“It was kind of a bummer,” Hennrikus said. —Staff writer June Q.

With flu season looming, the Harvard School of Public Health recently founded a new research center that will focus on improving the understanding of infectious diseases and making information on the subject more accessible to the public and policy makers.The Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics will be funded by the National Institutes of Health’s Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS) with a renewable grant of approximately $2 million a year for five years.The new HSPH organization will become MIDAS’s second “Center of Excellence,” and will be devoted both to research and its applications. The first is located at the University of Pittsburgh.“We focus on policy interaction, outreach, education, and research,” said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the HSPH who will be heading the new research center. “Four mandates instead of just one.”The grant allotment will officially begin next week, Lipsitch said, adding that the Center’s immediate goals include the continuation of “urgent” work on the H1N1 flu.“We’re trying to follow the path of the H1N1 as it evolves over the autumn and winter,” he said.Lipsitch said that the Center already has produced substantial research in time for flu season’s arrival.Edward Goldstein, a research scientist at the HSPH who has been modeling the dynamics of H1N1 transmission in households, said he is looking forward to working in the new organization. One of his recent projects for the Center looked into the benefits of dispensing the common antiviral drug Tamiflu to individuals at high-risk of getting the H1N1 virus before flu cases begin coming in droves.“I hope that our results will soon be used to advise policy makers to make decisions,” Goldstein said.But the HSPH center aims to reach even farther, according to Lipsitch. He said that he hoped the Center will also actively educate the next generation of “data-savvy modelers” by offering graduate courses and funding research opportunities.The idea of a new research center solely devoted to modeling infectious diseases arose last spring when NIH announced the possibility of new funding, said Lipsitch.According to Irene Eckstrand, a MIDAS Scientific Officer, the Harvard center will be “differentiated not by the questions they seek to answer, but by the methods they use.”HSPH’s researchers will be focusing on the use of mathematical models to analyze the spread of infectious diseases.  In contrast, MIDAS’ other centers have primarily relied on “individual-base models,” which involve finding patterns in tracking an enormous number of individuals.“With a mathematical model, you give up a little realism, but you gain understanding of what’s happening,” Lipsitch said.“I’m really excited about the Harvard center,” said Eckstrand. “I think it has all the strengths to take on the leadership role in developing modeling and research planning tools for the United States.”—Staff writer Helen X.

Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean made an impassioned case for the public option in health care at an incident-free town hall meeting last night while holding the Democratic leadership accountable for not taking full advantage of its majority in both chambers of Congress.“If you have a majority and you don’t use it, you lose it,” he said. “If we can’t deliver health care, we deserve to lose our majority.”Dean emphasized that the public option was non-negotiable. “The single-payer is one position; the present system is another position. What we’re advocating with the public option is the compromise,” he told the mostly middle-aged and elderly Cambridge-area crowd at the First Parish Church at an event sponsored by Harvard Book Store. “We’re not going to compromise anymore because that is the compromise already.”Though he avoided calling out the White House as spineless for suggesting compromise, he joked that some “spinal transplants” that he had performed on Democrats in Congress were “rejected.” During the question-and-answer session, a  middle-aged woman pressed Dean on what “rank-and-file” people should do if Obama backs away from the public option. Dean blamed Obama’s advisers for convincing the president that any health care bill that’s passed would be a victory.“But a bill without the public option is not victory; it’s defeat,” Dean declared.The crowd’s frustration with Obama was more palpable. The final questioner simply asked, “Why aren’t you the Secretary of Health and Human Services?”“I used to wonder about that and worry about that,” Dean said. “But I must say I couldn’t have said any of the  kinds of things I said tonight if I were.”Though Dean lambasted the Democrats’ attempt to include Republicans in the process when they weren’t going to vote for a Democrat-sponsored bill anyway, he made a point of praising the “Blue Dog” Democrats for strengthening what he called “one of the very best parts of this bill”: a provision that the government would help defray small businesses’ health insurance costs.“We need a few new jobs in this country after Bush got through with us for eight years,” he said, citing that small businesses produce 80 percent of America’s new jobs. For the most part, Dean hewed to the same argument for efficiency that Obama has been making across the country, rather than presenting the moral case for giving every American decent health care. He pointed out how the current health care system defeats the free market’s supply-and-demand curve.“Our system is broken,” said Dean, who is also a licensed physician. “Our incentives are broken. Our mindset is  broken.” —Staff writer Bonnie J. Kavoussi can be reached at kavoussi@fas.harvard.edu

The Harvard Crimson ran a controversial advertisement on page seven of yesterday’s paper that suggested that the Holocaust did not occur, sparking outrage across campus.The advertisement, submitted by Bradley Smith, founder of the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust, challenged readers to “provide, with proof, the name of one person killed in a gas chamber at Auschwitz.” It has been pulled, and will not run on other days this week as originally requested by Smith.News of the advertisement spread quickly as students expressed their shock and anger over various organization and House e-mail lists.The Crimson received over 20 separate e-mails as well as a joint letter signed by over 30 undergraduates—including several Crimson editors.“Some of us are the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors and were deeply hurt by the implication that those stories passed on to us of our past—of lives lost and families destroyed—were all lies concocted by a vast Jewish conspiracy,” the joint letter said.Upon seeing the ad in the paper, Harvard Hillel leaders contacted Crimson President Maxwell L. Child ’10, requesting that a formal apology be printed in the paper.The advertisement’s publication was the result of miscommunication and failed oversight, according to Child, who wrote in a statement published online last night that the ad was printed even though The Crimson had decided earlier in the summer not to run it.“Unfortunately, with three weeks of vacation between submission and publication, that decision fell through the cracks,” Child wrote in a statement. “While running the ad was not our intent, we accept responsibility for our failure to carry out the planned cancellation.”He stressed that The Crimson does not endorse views put forth in any advertisement, though the University daily is in fact responsible for all its published content.Citing the lapse in communication, Child wrote that he hopes The Crimson’s readers will accept that the error was “a logistical failure and not a philosophical one.”Child declined to comment beyond what was in the statement.Hillel undergraduate President Rebecca D. Gillette ’10 sent an e-mail to Hillel’s listserv yesterday evening regarding the circumstances surrounding the advertisement’s placement.“The fact that [The Crimson] took responsibility for their actions is very impressive,” Gillette said in an interview later.—Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.

Heading into the 2009 season, the Harvard field hockey team could have fallen back on any number of excuses. With just five upperclassmen on the roster, no backup goaltender, and only three available subs on the bench, it would have been easy to explain a sluggish start to the season.But the Crimson hasn’t needed those excuses. Instead, Harvard (2-0) recorded its second straight win last night, defeating UC Davis (3-2), 4-1, at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.“I thought that we played well,” junior Chloe Keating said. “We had a lot of offensive opportunities. It’s tougher playing a Wednesday game. It was our first night game, so it was nice to get acclimated to that…and it was great to win our first night game.”The Crimson was led once again by Keating’s outstanding play. After a five-point effort Saturday against Holy Cross, the forward had a hand in all four Harvard goals last night, scoring twice and assisting on two others.The Crimson offense had no trouble getting things started against the Aggies, who are fielding their first intercollegiate team since 1982. Harvard took control at the opening whistle and peppered UC Davis keeper Lauren Sawvelle with 10 shots and five penalty corners in the first seven minutes of play. “We did a really good job of capitalizing on our offense in the first half,” co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon said. “We generated a lot of offense early on…which gave us a lot of opportunities to score.”Keating was the first one to get the ball in the cage, taking a pass from sophomore Carly Dickson in the eighth minute. Keating reverse chipped the ball over Sawvelle and into the top right corner.The Crimson continued to pressure the Aggie defense, amassing a 16-2 edge in shots during the first half. Keating took advantage of her opportunities again with nine minutes remaining in the opening period, as sophomore Georgia McGillivray sent in a shot off a corner, and Keating deflected it in for her second goal of the night and a 2-0 Harvard lead.“Chloe did a really great job of capitalizing on our attack,” Goodman-Bacon said. “She took some great shots from the top of the circle, and she did a really great job of being tenacious in the circle so we could get some shots on goal.”McGillivray nearly notched a tally of her own at 28:47, but the shot ricocheted off the crossbar and out of play.Harvard continued its onslaught in the opening minutes of the second half, but this time, it was freshman Emma Keller who found the back of the net. Keating took a pass from Dickson off a restart, and streaked toward the net alongside Keller. As Sawvelle came out of the cage to challenge Keating, she passed the ball off to the rookie, who tipped it in for the 3-0 lead. Just eight minutes later, Keating and Keller connected again. The junior dribbled into the circle and lifted the ball in the air, setting Keller up to bat it into the cage.“Obviously, Emma has been doing a really great job finishing,” Keating said. “She hasn’t shown any type of inexperience, she really has jumped on the field as a freshman. We’re really excited to have her on the forward line.”UC Davis continued to fight for its opportunities, finally getting on the board with under eight minutes to play. Ellre Ancheta fed the ball to Lindsey Valadez off a penalty corner, and Valadez beat Crimson keeper Cynthia Tassapoulous to make the score 4-1. Tassapoulous had five saves on the evening, four of which came in the second half, which saw the Aggies take an 8-6 advantage in shots.“Cynthia is playing really well,” Goodman-Bacon said. “She’s communicating very well, which is great for our defense.”It is the first time since 2005 that Harvard has opened the season with back-to-back wins, a fact that could be attributed to the team’s offseason training regimen.“A lot of us played together over the summer and worked out here, which was helpful in terms of being in a rhythm,” Keating said. “A lot of our players came in in really good physical shape. It’s been really good for our offense.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years ago, Brian Rogers was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Or so said his detractors.
Rogers, an eighth grader at the K-12 Bronxville School in Bronxville, N.Y., was starting for the varsity boys’ soccer team, and some argued that it was too much, too soon. But with the Broncos down, 2-0, to North Salem in his first game, Rogers provided his rebuttal, seamlessly transferring a high pass from his chest to his foot and burying the ball in the bottom right corner of the net.
“You knew his composure was there [from the start],” says Donald Lucas, Rogers’ coach at Bronxville. “You knew that he had just answered all his critics.”
Today, Rogers is a freshman forward on the Harvard men’s soccer team, and no one is arguing about whether he belongs.  Never looking back after that fateful first game, he put together a stellar career at Bronxville, including a senior season in which he set school records with 44 regular-season and 15 postseason goals and led the Broncos to their first ever New York State championship. Rogers also excelled at a high level with the Albertson Soccer Club in Long Island, N.Y., one of the most elite club teams in the nation.
“He’s one of the few kids I’ve ever coached [who’s] just so relentless in the pursuit of being one of the top players in his position,” says Aidan Gaitan, who coached Rogers on Albertson. “He practices like he plays...He just always, always, always wants to do well. You don’t find kids like that nowadays.”
When Rogers got to Harvard, the question wasn’t if he would make an impact, but when.
It turned out to be right away. Midway through the first half of the Crimson’s season opener against Stony Brook on Friday, Harvard coach Jamie Clark sent Rogers into the game. The Seawolves would score shortly after to go up 1-0, but the Crimson’s new striker had an answer just minutes later. Receiving a nifty pass from classmate Scott Prozeller, Rogers blazed past the Stony Brook defenders on a breakaway and lofted a shot into the top left corner to tie the score and announce his arrival on the collegiate soccer scene.
“That just gave me a lot of confidence,” Rogers says. “You kind of have that fear about your first goal. You know that one’s going to be the hardest. It was such a huge relief.”
Rogers followed his debut with an assist in the Crimson’s 2-0 shutout of Boston College on Monday, capping off an impressive weekend that has only added to the already considerable hype surrounding him.
The 6’2 striker is saddled with the unenviable task of replacing Mike Fucito ’09, who currently plays professionally with Major League Soccer’s Seattle Sounders. If that weren’t enough, Rogers is also the heir apparent to Harvard co-captain Andre Akpan, the Crimson’s all-time leading scorer—before Friday’s game, Akpan told Rogers, perhaps only half-jokingly, “This is the first step to breaking all my records.”
“Brian was one of the top 10 attacking recruits in the country last year, so our expectations for him and his expectations for himself are incredibly high,” Clark says. “Having [Akpan] takes a little bit of pressure off of him, but he still knows they have to be a one-two combo. He’s going to be the guy when Andre gets double teamed and things happen.”
With the pair of Rogers and Akpan so inextricably linked on the field, positive chemistry between the two is essential to Harvard’s success. Fortunately for the Crimson, Akpan has established himself as his young teammate’s most trustworthy resource since Day One.
According to LoHud.com’s high school soccer blog “Just Kickin’ It,” when Rogers was deciding between playing college ball at Harvard or Duke, Akpan—who once faced the same dilemma—was a major factor in swinging Rogers towards the Crimson.
Since Rogers arrived on campus, Akpan has immediately assumed the role of mentor, spending extra time with the rookie at practice and sitting next to him on the team bus.
“Andre...helped get me ready for the difference between high school ball and college ball,” Rogers says.
“The nice thing is that Andre has taken [Rogers] under his wing,” Clark says. “No matter how talented you are coming in, at every level you move to there’s still a lot of things to learn...Andre realizes how important Brian is to the team and even for that matter to his own success.”
As for Akpan’s record-breaking challenge?
“If I could have a career anywhere near as great as Andre’s has gone so far, I would be ecstatic,” Rogers says. “Obviously I’m not coming in here with the sole goal to break his records.”
No, while Rogers may someday succeed Akpan in the line of great Crimson goal scorers, his primary assignment is not to try to replicate Akpan’s legacy. Instead, Rogers has four years to create his own, and regardless of expectations, it will belong to him. Apparently, not much has changed since eighth grade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a chilly night earlier this week. A Monday or Tuesday, I believe. I was right by Holyoke Street, just a block from Harvard square. Sweat drenched my brow. My heart was pounding. Two muscular, raging men were right in front of my face. I was pumping my legs as fast as I could, but I wasn’t going anywhere. I was thrusting my arms back and forth, but connecting with no targets. 
I wasn’t being assaulted or mugged. I was actually at the MAC, doing my regular cardio workout on an elliptical machine while watching a bro-brawl on 'Real World Cancun'. I was surrounded by others in the same situation: students trudging through their routines, zero calorie fitness water in hand, intently watching people with lives less monotonous than their own. 
Then the revelation came to me: it was time to try something new. What would it be? The clue was right in front of my eyes.
Not a day later, I learned about the Harvard Self Defense Club. Unofficially started in the fall of 2007 by George D. Eggers '10 and Dan H. Oshima '10, the Harvard Self Defense Club began as the Harvard Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Club, an underground movement for MMA enthusiasts and gym-rats alike. Eggers, who coaches Muay Thai and has competed in Hapkido in South Korea, began training intensely with Oshima, who coaches Judo in his hometown of Somerville, MA and has won two national championships.
Their motivation was the rapidly increasing popularity of UFC fighting, which ESPN has recognized as one of America’s fastest growing sports. UFC fighters employ moves from many different martial arts, engaging in both standing moves and moves from the ground.
Eggers and Oshima began practicing these moves and sharing techniques in gyms around campus, but knew that others would love to participate. 
“We started a facebook group, and after two weeks, we had 25 guys coming,” Eggers said. “We would start out with basic drills, and every week was alternating between two days of striking and one day of groundwork, or the other way around.”
While the training is as intense as it sounds, the level of variety in their training routines has great appeal for bored-out-of-their-mind Jazzercisers such as myself. 
“We wanted a club martial art that was going to give people a great workout,” Oshima said. “Doing MMA, you’re going to get cardio, plyometrics, and more, all from one club, and at the same time you are going to learn really useful technique. A complete package is really what we are trying to do.”
Training continued throughout their sophomore year, and efforts to become an official club started in the fall of 2008. 
For reasons that some could imagine, Eggers, Oshima, and other group board members ran into trouble when it was time to formalize.
“It literally took us an hour per day calling people just to find out who we had to talk to,” said Eggers. “One guy asked me if people weren’t going to do it just to start fighting people in the streets.”
Televised portrayal of MMA fighters as bloodthirsty entertainment surely contributed to the groups’ struggles. However, MMA employs techniques from various martial art forms that are officially recognized on campus. 
After eight months of phone tag with members of the athletic department, the Harvard Mixed Martial Arts Club became the Harvard Self Defense Club. The club does not champion brute violence or mindless “fighting”, but, according to Eggers, can guarantee “high intensity cardio training and a mix of weights, bodyweight exercises, hard drills, speedbag, pull ups, and jumping jacks.”  
Harvard students are visibly active, motivated, and driven. Many of us rely on consistency for sanity. I personally feel like an OCD hamster when I’m on an elliptical machine at the MAC, and it has to be the 2nd one from the back on the right side. 
If anyone out there shares my sentiments, perhaps you should check out the MMA guys. I know I will. Next time things get heated on Holyoke Street, or in Cancun, I’ll be ready.

Admit it. The first time you got accosted by a swarm of fifty tourists in the yard, you felt like a rock star.
And then it started to get creepy—you realized that the tourists weren’t just interested in petting John Harvard’s distinguished extremity—they wanted a picture of you, an authentic Harvard student.
Can’t get enough of that unpleasant, mildly tingly sensation?
Thanks to Harvard College Interactive Media Group (HCIMG), you can now play yourself in digital form: You, a courageous Harvard student who looks a little like Mario circa 1985, must dodge zillions of identical (suspiciously Asian looking) tourists as you scramble to gather school supplies and deliver them to Annenberg before you get caught in the crossfire of three camera flashes (and then die). The game is called Yard Quest. It’s as awesome as it sounds. More after the jump.The old school graphics and sound effects are kind of cute, and Flyby was sad when we beat the only level in about 10 minutes. If the brilliant creators Adam Gold '11 and Frances Yun ’10 feel so inclined (and read this), we have some suggestions for levels two through four: (2) Dodge disaffected youths with blue dreadlocks in The Square (3) Bathe muggers in Cambridge Commons with pepper spray (4) Avoid previous hook-ups while doing an especially conspicuous (smeared eye-liner) walk of shame back to the Yard.
Beat the game? Watch overly zealous tourists take a picture of a squirrel.

You know that scene in Matilda where Miss Trunchbull forces the poor fat boy to ingest an entire chocolate cake in front of his aghast peers? It's the most awful thing to watch, but for some reason, you can't seem to rip your eyes away, investing yourself in the horror of the scene until you seem to feel the goop greasing the sides of your own esophagus.
FlyBy thinks that might be how it would feel if it watched the play WATERBOARD, an Institute for Intermediate Studies production. Club Oberon in Harvard Square will open the play on Sunday at 8 PM.
The play "aims to create awareness and discussion about waterboarding as a form of torture." How, you may ask? Well, performers Nadeem Mazen and Stephanie M. Skier '05 will be waterboarding each other for approximately three minutes of the show. Find out more after the jump.
"Waterboarding seemed to be the term in circulation, and I think it's something that many people do not understand in terms of what it physically looks like," says Skier, the play's director and writer who sought training from someone who had gone through Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE), a U.S. program that trains troops to withstand torture.
"Part of the project of creating a visual image of waterboarding in the space of the theater, which is very much a visual space, is to highlight the present absence of documentary visual evidence of waterboarding," Skier adds in an interview with FlyBy.
The show, which seeks to explore the history of drowning torture, will encourage interaction with the audience and employ animation to demonstrate more dangerous forms of waterboarding ("We're not going to do those on stage because we don't want to die," Skier notes). To explore "the eerily whimsical linguistic connotations" of the term "waterboarding," Mazen and Skier will also "play on slip’n’slides and toss beach balls while singing about 'enhanced interrogation techniques,'" according to the event's Facebook page.
"What does it mean to bear witness to something that we had not seen ourselves and don't have access to evidence of? " Skier says. "We are functioning as witnesses but at the same time acknowledging that we are incapable of doing that in any real way."

As our readers point out, The Crimson sure got itself in trouble yesterday.
The whole episode started when Bradley R. Smith, director of the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust, called The Crimson looking to run a few ad insertions in this week's Crimson, hoping to influence a few "empty vessels" into rethinking Holocaust history.
The Crimson had been down this road before, going so far as to write an editorial discussing why it refused to run this very same ad from this very same person...back in 1994.  Nevertheless, the ad appeared on page 7 of yesterday's Crimson.
Once word got around, outrage ensued.  The first e-mail hit a Harvard open list around noon. Next, On Harvard Time picked it up.  Then IvyGate.  Then Gawker.
What did The Crimson have to say for itself?  A bureaucratic mix-up, of course.

It appears the FAS Communications Office is being downsized. Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an e-mail Tuesday to faculty and staff that Harvard's central communications bureau would increasingly be taking on the FAS Office's duties. Budget-cutting consolidation, perhaps?
Not according to Smith, who wrote that the move came "in light of" his decision to give the Office's director Bob Mitchell the new title of assistant dean for diversity relations and communications. In which case, it's unclear why getting another person to run the office was off the table, though Smith does drop the term "cost-effective" at the tail end of the note.
Still, FAS Communications Office or not, it would seem the Faculty can still stay on message. Read the full announcement, after the jump.
Dear FAS Faculty and Staff,
I am very pleased to announce that Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Assistant Dean and Director of Communications Robert P. Mitchell has been named the new FAS Assistant Dean for Diversity Relations and Communications. In his new role, Bob will serve as a liaison and advisor on diversity programs and initiatives.
Harvard University must constantly work to maintain and enhance the diversity of its faculty, staff, and students, while also meeting the often unique needs of every member of our community, regardless of background. As the Co-Chair of the Harvard Association of Black Faculty, Administrators and Fellows, and the FAS Diversity Committee, Bob has helped lead the effort to make Harvard's campus more diverse and welcoming for all members of our community. As the first Assistant Dean for Diversity Relations and Communications, he will continue that work by coordinating and spearheading diversity efforts across the many different areas of the FAS.
Reporting to the FAS Dean for Administration and Finance, Bob will serve as a bridge between our efforts on faculty diversity by the Senior Advisor on Faculty Development and Diversity, staff diversity by the Assistant Dean and Director of Staff Diversity, and student diversity by the deans of the College and Graduate School. He will coordinate and help us to communicate more effectively about the various FAS diversity programs and initiatives underway now and in the future. He will also research and share information regarding benchmarking best practices and inclusion strategies for the entire FAS community.
In light of Bob's decision to take on this exciting new assignment, I have requested that communications resources in the Harvard Public Affairs and Communications office cover the responsibilities associated with the position of FAS Director of Communications, as well as oversee Bob's direct reports. In the coming months we will transition a number of communications functions within the FAS to this central office. The goal is to create a new structure that better serves our communication needs and does so in a more cost-effective manner.
We thank Bob for his years of service as FAS Director of Communications and welcome him to his new role.
Sincerely yours,
Michael D. Smith

So it turns out it wasn't just a coincidence when you schlepped all the way to C'est Bon Convenience only to find that someone else had gotten to your 30s before you. And when Doma failed you that same night. Yeah, that's right. The calendar reform caught the two primary liquor providers in the Square off guard.
Guess they weren't ready for summer vacation to end either. Doma employee Subash Khadka estimates they order roughly double the amount of alcohol during the school year. Imagine their surprise when a slew of students in search of alcohol turned up before Labor Day. You don't have to graph any supply and demand curves to figure out we were hit by an temporary liquor shortage.
Christopher J. Taylor '12 of Adams noted that the "drunks" have been "particularly cranky." To be fair, Flyby doesn't think it's just the "drunks" whose thirst has not been slaked by cheap beers. But Taylor is right in saying there hasn't been a lot of booze to go around these days.
Never fear, though. C'est Bon and Doma are both placing large shipments of alcohol for the weekend ahead.
In the meantime, we hear through the grapevine that Blanchard's in Allston still boasts a pretty solid stash.

Math lecturer Oliver Knill—the Swiss-born course head for Math 21a and 21b—has a secret life. He's better known outside Harvard not for inducting countless math and science concentrators into the ways of multivariable calculus, but for his comprehensive, online list of movie clips with math references.
It's not just A Beautiful Mind or Proof either. In Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay, Kumar wins over his long-lost girlfriend when she's about to marry his arch-rival, by reciting the poem that she had tried to get him to read aloud when they first met (and made out) in a library:
"I fear that I will always be a lonely number like root 3," he recites from memory. "The three is all that is good and right. Why must my 3 keep out of sight, beneath a vicious square root sign?"
"Such is my reality, a sad irrationality," Kumar continues. "When hark, what is this I see? Another square root of a three comes quietly waltzing by. Together now we multiply to form a number we prefer—rejoicing as an integer."
More unexpected math cinema, after the jump.
Dr. Knill said that he started this Web site in 2006 just for fun as a movie collector. "I love movies," said Dr. Knill, who grew up in a Swiss village on the Rhine River near Zurich. "My place is filled with books and movies. We have stacked them on the floors."
But Dr. Knill's collection has transformed into much more than a just-for-fun Web site. At least 100 public high school teachers across the country have contacted Dr. Knill, who started teaching at Harvard in 2000, to let him know that they have used his movie clips in class, sometimes using them for class assignments and projects. Some of these teachers (and even a few high school students) write to Dr. Knill to send him suggestions for other movie clips.
Some great movies, other than Harold and Kumar, whose clips are showcased include Back to the Future III, Mean Girls, an episode from The Simpsons, The Da Vinci Code, and more Mean Girls. Yes, FlyBy has very high-brow taste.

To the millions of pre-admits, pre-admit families, and kindergarten hopefuls, Dean of Admissions William R Fitzsimmons’ word is gold—gold that will be gracing the pages of The New York Times college admissions blog, The Choice, from September 10-15. Readers are invited to post questions for Fitzsimmons of which (and mind you the posts will likely hit 1,000 before Flyby finishes writing this post) he will answer 2-3 per day.
Fitzsimmons said he immediately agreed when his long time acquaintance at the NYT, Jacques Steinberg, proposed the idea two weeks ago.
“It is an opportunity to reach out, what you want to do as an admissions officer is serve the public interest…it also would allow us to answer some of the questions most on people’s minds and  try to demystify and demythologize so many urban legends about admissions,” Fitzsimmons told Flyby.
In our own attempt to help the dean sift through the pages and pages and pages of questions, Flyby chose a few we found most relevant or all-encompassing.
Read after the jump for a little preview.
FlyBy: Here’s a good one, one guy asked why the cost of higher education now outpaces the standard of living…
William R. Fitzsimmons: The average household doesn’t have to conduct cutting edge research in labs that cost millions of dollars to run…[for one thing]… there are lots of reasons, that’s one [question] we will take some time to answer.
FB: This one’s more straightforward: Will Harvard ever reinstate transfer admissions?
WRF: Your guess is as good as mine on that one.
FB: Hmm, this one seems relevant. This person asks about your thoughts on the “industry of admissions consultants.”
WRF: This is an industry that has been growing over the past 5-10 years in part because there are less resources available to students in high schools…there are schools in which there are ratios of nearly 1000 to 1 counselees to counselor…in this crisis situation there has certainly been an industry that has grown to meet this unmet need… (WRF noted that many consultants, finding themselves in situations where they are disproportionately helping already advantaged students, have begun to do pro-bono work as well.)
FB: Okay you’re probably not going to love this one, “Can you comment on the admissions preference given to legacy students, athletes, and minorities?”Flyby broke this question down a bit… (We were specifically interested in how Harvard has been nabbing so many all-star athletes lately…)
WRF: We prize excellence of all kinds… part of the American college experience is athletics; it’s a form of excellence. In many communities students can’t afford a cello [for example] but have sports programs… We have the largest number of intercollegiate sports – it has been a way to reach out to students who would not have been able to come to Harvard otherwise, if you look at student athletes later in life it’s amazing what they have done.
Case in point: WRF played goalie for Harvard’s Men’s Hockey from ’64-’67.
