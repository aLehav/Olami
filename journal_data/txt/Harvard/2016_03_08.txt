After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Rihanna’s newly released music video for “Work,” in which her song is played twice over the course of seven and a half minutes, addresses issues of Caribbean immigrant workers in the United States. In the first loop, a homage to her home culture, Rihanna is clad in a loosely crocheted slip, paying tribute to the bright colors of Caribbean island countries’ flags. She is at a party, and the women are swaying their hips to the music, celebrating Caribbean culture and choreography. Rihanna’s lyrics are sung in the Bajan creole of her native Barbados—for example, “He said me haffi work” and “meh nuh care if him hurt.”
The second time the song is played, it presents a message about immigrant work and the difficulty it poses to familial and romantic relationships. Rihanna and Drake are alone in a living room with pink walls and purple lighting. The candy-tinted color-scheme suggests a fantasy world, perhaps in the imagination or mind’s eye of Rihanna and Drake, who represent a couple torn by the distances involved in work abroad. Drake sings, “Yeah, okay, you need to get done, done, done, done at work,” recognizing the necessity of finding employment, but he laments, “Long distance, I need you.” Still, he admits, “When I see potential I just gotta see it through,” again referring to the job opportunities that are only available far away. Rihanna chimes in, “Please recognize I’m trying, babe. I have to work, work, work, work, work, work.” The repetition of the word “work” emphasizes the tediousness and inescapability of the job. Rihanna dances subtly in the foreground as Drake watches in the background. They caress each other but are unable to take things further, reflecting the limitations caused by distance.
In a time when the rights of immigrant workers are threatened by the political scene, Rihanna steps up to defend her compatriots. She has succeeded in her own move from Barbados to America, but others still struggle, and she is bringing to light their effort and contributions. Rihanna’s music video for “Work” is not only an experimental artistic representation of her music but also a powerful political and cultural message.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge-based folk band Darlingside blends vocals and an eclectic array of instruments, ranging from the classical violin to the mandolin. The four members of the group, who met in a Williams College a cappella group, are now on tour playing songs off their critically acclaimed 2015 album “Birds Say,” and will appear at the Sinclair in Cambridge on March 26. Bassist Dave Senft sat down with the Harvard Crimson to talk about the sources of the group’s sound.
The Harvard Crimson: What is your personal favorite song off your new album “Birds Say”?
Dave Senft: I guess there’s a reason that we named the album “Birds Say,” the same as the track “Birds Say.” I don’t know if it’s fair to say that that’s my favorite song, but that’s a song that we had never played live. When we went in to record the album, it wasn’t even finished really. We just had some ideas. It really came together during the recording process… So by the time we finished recording the vocals it was 3 or 4 a.m., and we just had this brand-new song that we had all finished together. It was very powerful, what we felt after that process. Among other reasons, I think that’s why we gravitated toward using a lyric from that song for the title of the album.
THC: What sources do you draw from when you’re writing lyrics?
DS: When we first became involved in songwriting, we were each writing our own songs, and then we began to team up more and more, and now it’s at the point where we basically write every song together, as four people. Every song is a little bit different, and every song comes from four different people, so of course depending on who you talk to, there will be a lot of different sources of inspiration. We do tend to write a lot about childhood and growing up and how things change as you get older… We’re also thinking a lot about the sounds of the words that we’re using, as one component of the way the song is arranged. It’s like how a cello sounds different from a violin, so you’re going to use a cello differently than you would use a violin, and you’re going to choose different moments in which to use each. The same goes for the “o” sound of a word or the “ah” sound or the “ooh” sound. A lot of times when we’re writing the melodies we’re thinking about what sounds we really like in this or that moment, whether we want an “ah” sound or an “ooh” sound, and then we’ll take those sounds and we’ll figure out what words match those sounds and build off from there.
THC: Could you describe your working process? How do all four of you work together?
DS: I think a lot of times when you’re writing a song you get really excited about an idea, and you want the song to be exactly the way it is in your head, and so letting go of some of those ideas and letting someone else in on that process is very hard. You have to be able to be vulnerable. You have to be able to defend your ideas but also to let them go. We’ve spent a lot of time honing that process, and I think in the end it comes down to the fact that we’re all really close friends. We met in college, we sang together in college, long before we were in this band. That certainly helps with being able to trust and to let go of our ideas and be vulnerable with each other. That’s been a beautiful process to develop over the last ten years.
THC: Do you have any advice for college students interested in pursuing music professionally?
DS: When we started out, we were talking about the idea of going into a musical career, and somehow the idea of a Plan B came up, like what would be the back-up plan for different people in the group. And I think it was the dad of one of the guys in the group who said, “Don’t have a Plan B.” That was his advice… That’s not to say that at some point you might not have to face the fact that it’s not working and find something else, but if you go in with a well-formulated back-up plan you’re going to find that there will be a time when you fall back on that. It’s in some ways easier and better to go in with no back-up plan so that you are just forced to try, even when it’s incredibly hard and it seems like it’s not working.
THC: Are there musical traditions that you as a group see yourselves as being part of?
DS: As a group, I think we’re pretty excited about the Boston music scene right now. We sort of moved to Boston accidentally. We were living in North Hampton, and some of our significant others were in Boston, so we just kind of thought we’d move here and see what it was like being in a city. We’ve ended up becoming incredibly close with a few other Boston acts. We’ve been feeling like there might be a new tradition starting, that we’re a part of, of Boston-based folk music.
THC: How do you forge a coherent sound from the wide variety of instruments—from cello to mandolin, double bass to banjo—that you all play?
DS: We have so many instruments at our disposal, and in some cases we’ve picked up new instruments for the band. I played a little guitar in college, but I never played bass until the band. Don [Mitchell] learned banjo for the band. We’ve started to see all the instruments as different voices. We met in an a cappella group, and in a cappella you’re often using your voice to sound like different instruments. There’s something freeing in that approach, and that’s something we’ve taken a little bit into what we’re doing now, where any instrument can really be doing anything. You can use a cello to sound like a voice, you can use a guitar as a percussion instrument. There are traditional roles that instruments can play, and we like thinking about how we can flip those around… It’s something that I think has come to define our sound, the way that we combine instruments differently than a lot of other groups.

“A lot of people like to have trippy visuals behind them,” said Quilt’s guitarist Shane Butler about an hour into the band’s Feb. 26 concert at the Museum of Fine Arts. “I find this,” he continued, gesturing upstage, “to be the most out-there thing.” He was referencing a projection of an absurdly long midcentury infomercial for Frigidaire. Earlier, the indie-neo-psych group (a genre to which The Crimson has apparently assigned a beat writer) had been backed, as they debuted their third album “Plaza,” by grainy films of carpet cleaning processes and sundress-clad women exploring flower gardens “It’s crazy how we come to be and how things are represented,” Butler mused.
Crazy, indeed: In few contexts would such commonplace imagery seem genuinely surreal. But even with their very name, Quilt infuse—and amplify—the cosmic with the domestic. Butler and fellow guitarist-vocalist Anna Fox Rochinski approach inter-song banter with down-to-earth humor that interestingly contrasts the depth and indie cleverness of their lyrics. “This is fun—we’ve never played with strings before, live,” Butler said after the concert’s first song, “Passersby,” which comes from “Plaza.” An hour later, playing old material, he announced, “We’ve never played these songs with strings, ever, so this is a first-first-first.” If he was asking the audience for slack, he didn’t need to be: The strings were as well-integrated into the band’s sound as they are in “Plaza,” and they added nice flourishes to the older material.
Psychedelic rock may seem, at first glance, an odd fit for the MFA’s Remis Auditorium, a neat, small venue that feels more like a lecture hall than rock club; but Quilt are fundamentally an art-rock group. Any psychedelic influences are there as a dressing for the music, not as a part of Quilt’s ethos. This distinction helps the choice of Tredici Bacci as an opening act make a bit more sense. Tredici Bacci are a Boston-based 13-piece ensemble who play music inspired by Italian soundtracks of the 1960s and ’70s. The controlled chaos of these instruments, ranging from violin and trumpet to accordion and electric guitar, is directed by Simon “Luxardo” Hanes, a highly engaging frontman who plays guitar mostly with his back to the audience. Hanes’s self-aware persona—“Prove you don’t need a microphone by shouting the name of my favorite person: me!”—and Tredici Bacci’s musical complexity made them surprisingly apt complements for the main act. Their energy overflowed the stage.
“Plaza,” which The Crimson gave a mixed-to-positive review, worked better live than on record. The album’s strengths—its inviting sound, strong melodies, and excellent lyrics—remained, and its chief weakness, monotony, was less problematic in the live format, especially with the aforementioned visuals keeping the audience on its toes. Quilt also demonstrated their superb musicianship; in particular, Rochinski alternated seemingly effortlessly between complex, fingerpicked rhythm parts and slide leads, all while singing marvelously. Their three- and four-part vocal harmonies, which for all the album listener knows are overdubbed, positively shone; all four members are able singers. “Now it’s time for the drummer to sing a song, so it’s a good time to go to the bathroom,” drummer John Andrews joked before beautifully performing “Something There.” Fortunately, it appeared that no one did.
After playing “Plaza” from start to finish, Quilt performed seven of their most popular songs from prior albums. While all were tightly performed and well-chosen, Quilt offered two particular treats. First, as mentioned above, they welcomed their four-piece string ensemble from the “Plaza” segment of the show back for two previously unadorned songs. While they mostly just followed the guitar lines on “Arctic Shark,” they played a less trivial role on the captivating “Penobska Oakwalk,” creating an intro better suited to the band’s new, more psychedelic direction. Second, on “Penobska,” Rochinski invited Quilt’s former drummer Taylor McVay to join on backing vocals, a pleasant bit of continuity as they launch a six-week tour of their new album from their hometown.
By the time Quilt left the stage shortly before returning for a finale of “Cowboys in the Void,” the film reel had turned to footage of the maintenance of Pan-Am airplanes. “What is this? Oh, planes. Pan-Am. Cool,” Butler said. Whether or not the clip was truly random, it made for a fitting conclusion—as proudly idiosyncratic, charming, and compelling as the show itself. As Quilt depart on their tour, armed with additional instruments, a changed sound, and a new album, all signs indicate that they will fly high.

Christine Hong ’19 made her Symphony Hall debut on March 5, playing the first movement of Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Thomas Wilkins. A graduate of the New England Conservatory Preparatory School and the winner of the BSO’s 2015 Concerto Competition, Hong performs with the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and the Brattle Street Chamber Players. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Hong before her performance to talk about time management, stage fright, and learning from music.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you get involved with classical music?
Christine Hong: I started on the piano when I was five and quit because I hated it. After I quit, my mom just came home one day with a violin. She was like, “You’re going to play the violin now,” and I was like, “Okay.” I hated that too, so I quit for a year, then started again, then quit again, then started again. I’ve been playing for twelve years, but I hated music up until eighth grade. I was in the New England Conservatory’s Youth Philharmonic Orchestra, and we played Mahler’s Symphony No. 9. That was the first time I felt really emotionally moved by any piece of music. It was a turning point in my music career, because it was the first time I felt electrified and very connected with everyone in the orchestra. That’s when I started really wanting to do it because I loved it.
THC: How’s the balance between music and life at Harvard been?
CH: In high school I’d practice two to three hours a week, and rehearsals took up a lot of time. In college, I have even more rehearsal, but I stopped taking lessons because I wanted to focus on work. This semester, preparing for the performance with the BSO has helped keep me on track and forced me to practice. That push made me realize that I’m so much happier in general when I’m playing music, so I’m going to keep practicing, and doing orchestra and chamber and solo stuff. Last semester, I felt like a huge part of me was missing, and I think that contributed to a lot of unhappiness. I definitely want to keep taking lessons regularly.
THC: Who are some of your major influences, musical or otherwise?
CH: I really admire Itzhak Perlman. He’s been through so much in his life, being born with polio, and I love how he uses his passion for music to do something impactful for other people. After he made it as a soloist, he was highly involved in helping kids with polio. A lot of my respect for him comes from how genuine his passion is. The same goes for Yo-Yo Ma. I feel like both of them have such an infectious love for classical music, and it’s very important to have that kind of charisma and joy when playing, just as much as it is to be serious and a “classical musician.”
HC: Have you tried to pursue any projects like Perlman’s with your music?
CH: In high school, my best friend and I started Project Expression, which raised money to try to bring instruments and art materials to children in underprivileged areas around Boston. Other than that, I play for nursing homes.
HC: What are some habits or tricks you’ve cultivated, either during practice or onstage, for optimal performance?
CH: Oh, this is so bad! I always procrastinate practicing until two weeks before, consistently two weeks before, and then I practice five hours a day. But I get eight hours of sleep the night before, do a face mask in the morning, eat a healthy breakfast with a good amount of carbs, and two hours before the performance I nap for 20 minutes. And right before walking on, I eat a banana. I thought I’d be really nervous rehearsing with the BSO, but when I walk onstage, I don’t even sweat anymore. I almost feel like something’s biologically wrong.
HC: How has classical music affected how you see the world, or yourself?
CH: I think music has taught me to empathize and to feel for other people. When it comes to difficult social situations—and I’m not sure if there’s a direct correlation—I find my first instinct is to empathize with others and try to understand the situation from their perspective. I think part of that comes from music, connecting to people and trying to feel what they’re feeling, especially in chamber music and orchestra.
HC: How do you see yourself moving ahead with music?
CH: As of right now, I plan for it to be a hobby, but I want to find some way to incorporate it into my professional work. I’m looking for creative ways to combine psychology and music to help people. I still have time, so if I decide to pursue a masters in music later on, I’ll think more about that.
HC: If you couldn’t play music, what would you spend all the free time doing?
CH: Binge watching “Gossip Girl,” of course. Um—no, yeah, seriously. Or like, spending time with people. I should probably say spending time with people.

To countless children who grew up in the age of the newspaper, the Sunday comics constituted a sacred space. Even though people kind of sell comics short—they aren’t really given much weight either on the pop-culture playing field or in the curated realm of what one might call high art—the medium has demonstrated a remarkable and singular expressiveness as a popular form. Specifically, comics are uniquely capable of mixing both highbrow and lowbrow themes through their mix of often-whimsical illustration and text. Bill Watterson’s “Calvin and Hobbes” put the words of philosophers into the mouth of an irreverent, precocious six-year-old. Charles Schulz’s “Charlie Brown” was as much a chronicle of a round-headed, yellow-shirted, continual existential crisis as it was a fun-loving story about an average boy. For almost as long as they have existed, comics have concerned themselves with mashing together aesthetics associated with high and low culture, thus exposing those cultures as in many ways equivalent. Who’s to say Charlie Brown’s anguish is any less deep than that of Jay Gatsby? Who’s to say a green glob’s “To be, or not to be” is any less compelling than a performance by Richard Burbage?
As print media moved towards the digital world, though, the status of comics was inherently threatened. Without the widely syndicated platform of a newspaper comics page, how could comics maintain the same mode of cultural commentary in such a broadly accessible way? Beyond the obvious counter that the internet is the most broadly accessible thing in human history, how could a comic on the web attract a new, sufficiently large audience in order to have the same kind of subversive influence? The past decade of webcomics has revealed some surprising new conduits for the medium, which has discovered a byway in one of internet pop culture’s most powerful nascent forms: the meme.
At their core, memes are an important addition to the comic medium: They rely largely on the interplay between a pictorial and textual narrative for their meaning. Memes have a broad range of concerns; in the last week, I’ve come into contact with memes trying to convince me to vote for Bernie Sanders, forswearing the internet for the day, and celebrating the aesthetics of a ’90s Dixie cup. While memes, like comics, travel along avenues considered typically lowbrow, their concerns are anything but mundane.
Illustrated webcomics, like Kate Beaton’s “Hark! A Vagrant” and Ryan North’s “Dinosaur Comics,” have ridden the cultural meme-wave to breathe fresh life into the subversive mixture of registers for which comics have always stood. Beaton is most famous for a comic that has become a meme in itself, in which Tom Buchanan tells an indignant Jay Gatsby that his money is “old as balls.” The comic has given birth to numerous reworks, some by Beaton herself, and subtly entered the internet lexicon. North’s comics function most closely to image macro memes, where text is superimposed on a pre-existing image: Each comic has the same six panels, depicting three different dinosaurs in various poses. They’re the kind of illustrations that might be found on a children’s website about archaeology. North uses the constraints of his form, though, to address lofty subjects in the text of his comics, reaching as far as the many-worlds hypothesis and the intersection between human psychology and the failure of language. In fact, the mundane form that North chooses practically forces the subject matter of his comics to be interesting and nuanced; if they weren’t, the comic would be simplistic and boring. Superimposed text is easy to dismiss as a lazy form of commentary, but North uses it for the exact opposite end. North’s technique points towards the truth that the difference between highbrow and lowbrow is a myth; all forms of expression are merely tools, and a certain outward form or manner does not predict anything about a work’s content.
This subversion of the lowbrow/highbrow divide has stakes that reach far beyond simple aesthetics. Much of Beaton’s work concerns itself with undermining the dignity of historical or literary figures typically considered to be respectable. This seems a simple and somewhat inconsequential gesture until Beaton makes clear that the acceptance of that respectability denotes an ignorance of marginalized stories. Beaton gives delightful life to the less-heard-from figures in mainstream history and literature: She gives a voice to the prostitutes that Joan of Arc scorned; she pokes fun at the male savior complex behind Dirty Dancing’s “nobody puts baby in a corner”; she gives respect where it’s due to geneticist pioneer Rosalind Franklin and to women in science in general; and she lampoons the sexualization of female martyrs like the tragic Saint Cecilia. Breaking down the myth of things highbrow doesn’t just have to do with what gets put in museums. It has to do with empowering disenfranchised voices.

“Pass with me through a wonderful brazen tunnel, with crystal doors at the entrance,” Agnes Callow wrote in her 1851 book “Drops of Water.” In the 1840s, advances in grinding fragile sheets of glass refined the eye of the microscope, revolutionizing the science of that century. The instrument’s precious lens exposed new views of the Blaschkas’ glittering sea creatures.
Their earliest brochures marketed the Blaschkas’ products as “ornaments for the elegant room,” waterless aquaria that could serve the same function as their high-maintenance counterparts. By the time entrepreneur Henry Ward brought this casket of glass treasures to North America, however, universities and museums constituted the critical market for artificial sea creatures: The same difficulties that plagued hobbyists affected zoologists as well. The new audience brought new demands for accuracy. In a letter to naturalist Ernest Haeckel, Leopold wrote that his offerings in Ward’s 1878 catalog would be “restricted only to scientific models.” The Museum of Comparative Zoology archives hold a copy of this catalog; pencil marks in the margin note the price of the “Oaten Pipes Hydroid.” They also indicate the purchase of two enlargement models—a novel offering by the Blaschkas. That year, the glassworkers introduced into their oeuvre 13 microscopic views.
In 1877, the year they wrote to Haeckel, the Blaschkas also received their first shipments of living sea creatures. Aiming for more realistic models, they drew preparatory sketches from animals that swam in their aquaria. Ironically, however, the glassworkers and their customers struggled with precisely the same challenges: The Blaschkas’ home water usage increased by 120 percent, and suppliers sent them identical specimens repeatedly. Like many of their products, the Hydroid and its enlargements were modelled not from life but from a zoological illustration.
If the Blaschkas had been crafting bird eggs, they might have based on their works on photographs instead of drawings. During the latter decades of the 19th century, photography began filtering into zoological publications. Heated fights broke out in the scientific community over whether the new mechanical objectivity offered by photography could properly replace the trained judgment of the illustrator-observer. In this acrimonious conflict, microscopists hotly defended traditional methods of scientific illustration.
Although a microscope lens might have been clear as crystal, the picture it produced wasn’t so limpid. A cloudy twilight hung over the world of high magnification. Devotees of the finely ground lens relied on drawings to piece together the murky details their eyes tugged out of the shadows; the illustration was an invaluable aid to the devoted microscopist. During the fierce contest between the photograph and the drawing, the proponents of the microscope alleged that they could not carry out their work without the hand-drawn illustration. And the opinion of the microscope proponents was influential, given their importance; since the seminal publication of “Polypes” in 1744, no study of hydroids had been complete without the use of a microscope.

As students and faculty trudge across the frozen Yard, their bodies wrapped in large coats, thick scarves, and long pants, it can be hard to tell them apart—much less observe the fashion choices, accessories, and body modifications that lie beneath their winter shells. You may never see the line of words that girl in your section has permanently inked on her forearm, concealed by her long-sleeved sweater. You might never notice the tiny and permanent symbol etched into your problem set partner’s neck, hidden under his scarf.
Tattoos are all around us on Harvard’s campus. Students have them. Professors and TFs have them. Even some of the tourists pausing to take a picture with the John Harvard statue have them. But even when tattoos are immediately visible, the stories behind them often are not. Beneath these pieces of art lie families, ambitions, passions, and personal histories. Looking at tattoos at Harvard provides a frame through which to view the experiences that have shaped the person standing before you; the struggles that students face on campus and the way they face them; and the underlying anxieties that students have about life after college.
For many of those interviewed, the stories behind their tattoos are just as interesting and beautiful as the tattoos themselves. One common source of inspiration that people say greatly influenced their decision to get a tattoo was family members—both the desire to honor and, in some physical sense, to carry those ties with them.

Such is certainly the case for Jacqueline F. Epstein ’18. She lifts up her hair to show a small symbol on the back of her neck that combines a heart and infinity sign, a tattoo she got between her freshman and sophomore year following the death of her grandmother. "I don't believe in afterlife and stuff like that, so I got it after my grandmother died, kind of in memory of her,” she says. “I believe that... your soul doesn't live on, but the love you give other people when you are alive lasts forever. So that's like love forever.”
Avery A. Davis, a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Harvard Medical School, similarly got her first tattoo in memory of her then-recently deceased grandparents. “They both died shortly before my 18th birthday—my grandmother [died] a few months before, and my grandfather actually died on my 18th birthday,” she says. “I had been thinking about wanting to honor [my grandparents], and I had also been thinking about getting a tattoo." Her grandmother had loved butterflies; Davis opted instead for a dragonfly, since they have a very similar lifecycle to butterflies and also represented her grandfather to her in some ways. "My grandfather kind of had a lot of big transitions in his life, but he really turned it all around. And people don't think about it as much, but dragonflies go through as dramatic a... metamorphosis as butterflies do,” she says. So Davis designed her own tattoo of a dragonfly, ultimately choosing it for its aesthetic and deeply personal value.
Davis also has a family pedigree on the outside of her upper right thigh that she got shortly before starting grad school. It is, in part, an homage to her passion for her work in human genetics. “I don't actually work in classical human genetics with pedigrees, but pedigrees were kind of one of the first things that drew me to the subject as a high schooler," she says. However, the tattoo, which includes her grandparents, parents, and siblings, has meaning beyond her intellectual interests: It keeps her family close. “It's a way that my family is always by my side,” she says.
For Jimmie K. Hill ’18, his tattoos are a means by which he carries the people who shaped his past and made him who he is today. On his left shoulder he wears a black ink tribal tattoo, a design he says he chose because of its ties to his family’s Hawaiian heritage and its connotation of strength. While the tattoo carries this meaning for him, it is also symbolic of the way he was shaped by his turbulent relationship with his father—a man against whom he rebelled in high school in many ways, including his decision to get illegally tattooed in Las Vegas at the age of 15.  “I was going through a rough patch with my father, and he was controlling every aspect of my life,” he says. However, after getting the tattoo, he was inspired to see the situation in a new light. “Pretty much every day from that day forth, I woke up and I looked at it, and it reminded me that the decisions I make are my own. They're not my parents'. They're not my father’s.”
Although the tattoo associated with his father stemmed from a negative relationship, its counterpart adorning Hill’s right shoulder and chest has a nearly opposite source of inspiration. The tattoo—a koi pond surrounded by gladiolus flowers on his shoulder that connects to an oak tree, a Japanese pagoda, and a pond on his chest—honors the role that his loving mother played in his upbringing. The gladiolus, he says, is her birth flower, and he laughingly calls the peaceful koi fish her spirit animal. “This one is like my mother,” he says. “She played a very pivotal role in my development, and I definitely credit her for why I'm here and why I'm who I am. So essentially I wanted to get something to memorialize that so I could always have her with me."
 
While some tattoos recall the past for those who bear them, many are also a reminder to stay grounded in the present, particularly within Harvard’s often-stressful environment. As students navigate their way through clubs, classes, and a myriad of work experiences, they must also find a way to define success for themselves. This struggle to find and prioritize what is important to them within the high-pressure atmosphere that sometimes permeates Harvard’s campus can be a driving force behind students’ decisions to get a tattoo.
For Epstein, her tattoo commemorating her grandmother was also intended to be a reminder to stay focused on what matters despite what’s going on around her. “I get caught up my day-to-day obsessions and stress of college. I think everyone does,” she says. “So [this tattoo is] just to remind myself of the big picture sometimes. I'll just look at my tattoo and be like, 'Hey, I know you're worrying about the pset, but….’" However, she acknowledges that being a student at Harvard also affected the placement of her tattoo. "I think going here kind of influenced where I got it, because obviously most people don't see it. A lot of people don't know I have it,” she says. “I'm not ashamed of it or anything—I just wear my hair down a lot. But I think part of that was like, it'd be weird to have a very big one on my neck. I mean, I don't know. It's just not something I typically would associate with Harvard."
Epstein’s decision to get her tattoo in a place that is easily concealed illustrates a common trend among the undergraduates interviewed, all of whom had at least taken into consideration the effect a tattoo may have on employment opportunities and all of whom currently sport only tattoos that can be concealed. Many students declined requests for interviews, and one student even specified that she didn’t want to be identified by name for fear that a potential employer would be able to discover her tattoo by means of this article, potentially affecting her career prospects. Multiple undergraduates took into account the ability to cover a tattoo before choosing its location. “I haven't passed my elbows. So hopefully I can still get a job someday,” Hill says. “People are hella judgmental these days."  While times have certainly changed, and many now see tattoos as a much more mainstream and accepted form of body modification, it would appear that students’ fears aren’t completely ungrounded.
Ellen Gordon Reeves ’83, author of “Can I Wear My Nose Ring to the Interview?” and an alumna of the Graduate School of Education, works with private clients and travels the country speaking at schools, including Harvard, to help prepare students for the workplace. When it comes to tattoos, Reeves finds that it’s important to weigh multiple factors before making a decision. "I always say, 'To thine own self be true, but there are consequences,'” she says. "It matters what the tattoo is, where it is, and what the industry is." Students considering a tattoo, she says, must try to think long term. "If you don't have a tattoo, but you're thinking about getting one or getting one that you can't cover up, you have to understand that you might truly be limiting your employment options,” she says. “I tell them, 'You should decide what are your priorities. Tattoos are only one avenue of self-expression. So you have to decide which is more important to you: the tattoo or a specific job, if you know that you might be cutting yourself out of that opportunity.'"
While the undergraduates interviewed seem to share Reeves’ perspective, keeping their tattoos relatively discreet due in part to a fear of limiting employment options, the graduate students interviewed hold a slightly different outlook. While she admits that she might have felt differently had she not gotten into the programs she wanted to join, Davis says she has used organizations’ reactions to her tattoo as a metric for assessing whether she would fit in well. "I just figured if it was a place that wouldn't want me based on a tattoo, it wasn't a place that I wanted to be," she says of her decision to visibly display her dragonfly.
 
John M. Kelly, a first-year graduate student at the Divinity School who sports two small, identical, symmetrical crosses on their inner ankles and a half sleeve of grapes on a leafy vine on their right arm, echoes Davis’s sentiment. "My approach has been, if a program's going to have issues with having a visible tattoo, they're probably going to have other issues with my politics. And so perhaps that's not the right program for me," they (Kelly uses the pronouns they, them, and their) say with a laugh. The larger and more visible sleeve was in a part a reaction to what Kelly perceived as an ongoing rejection of body modifications by academia. “I think historically [the academic sphere] has been seen as a little antagonistic towards body modification and body art,” they say, at the same time recognizing that this isn’t necessarily so intensely the case today. “I didn't want to sort of buy into that sort of respectability politics that seems to be kind of part and parcel with pursuing graduate studies and academia as a whole.”
Of course, in choosing their tattoos and their placement, both Davis and Kelly do seem to have reflected on some of the same issues Reeves raised, clearly taking into account the environment they wanted to work in before making their choice. In fact, Reeves’s recommendation to consider what and where your tattoo is a current concern for Davis. While she has thought about getting a quarter sleeve on her shoulder, she has waited, due in part to the size and visibility of the area. "The shoulder tattoo would be really cool, but I go back and forth on whether I want one that's that big and visible,” she says. “That's the thing about my visible tattoo—[it] is pretty small. And there is a difference between having one small tattoo and a very large, body part-sized tattoo."
Although fear of eventual judgment can often impact many decisions surrounding tattoos, all of those interviewed described the majority of reactions from the Harvard community as positive. “They're a good conversation starter," says Hill, who claims that they have aided him in many of his interactions with female students.
For Kelly, too, tattoos have served as an avenue for interacting with others. Although sometimes the sleeve attracts the unwanted touch of a curious stranger, Kelly feels that the visibility of their tattoo often carries the potential to open a line of communication. "Once you have one visible mark, it makes other people a little more willing to open up about theirs, either if they have tattoos or desire to have tattoos,” they say. “So I think that's been cool because it sort of lets you in on a whole different facet of a person that often times, I think, is hidden.”
 
Davis has often discovered this kind of curiosity in undergraduates. "The people who have commented on it most recently to me have been undergrads. And I think maybe that has some of, 'Oh, real people have tattoos.'" The remarks, she says, have been only positive.
Anecdotal evidence aside, Felicity A. Lufkin, a lecturer on folklore and mythology, has proof in the form of an 11-person class that there is a definite interest, at least academically, in tattoos on Harvard’s campus. This spring, she launched the class “Tattoo: Histories and Practices” primarily in response to strong student enthusiasm. "I guess I had been thinking about [teaching a course on tattoos] for a while…. And one concentrator in particular got really excited about the idea, and everybody seemed to think, 'That's a fantastic idea,'” she says. “The particular reason I started teaching it this spring was because we had a folk and myth concentrator who really wanted to take it and is a senior. So I was like, 'OK, I'll put it together, and I'll do it this spring.'" The class has been a success, and Lufkin plans on teaching it next year.
By asking strangers about them, taking classes on them, and proudly sporting them as they walk between buildings, students across the schools of Harvard University continue to engage with the topic of tattoos. Simultaneously works of art and modes of expression, the tattoos on campus reflect a wide range of experiences, passions, and even family histories. Whether hidden under a long-sleeved shirt or framed by a backless dress, these tattoos—regardless of their visibility—are proud pieces of their wearer’s identities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Chatroom” is a hard play to do well. The 2010 film adaptation received a measly nine percent on Rotten Tomatoes, where critics called it “awkward and outdated,” its characters “underwritten,” and its dialogue “pantomimic.” Unavoidably, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s version, which ran Mar. 6 to 9, suffered from the same problems in its script. But as director Jamie P. Herring ’18 makes clear in his director’s note, “Chatroom” and the issues it raises have taken on a new significance this year at Harvard. Herring smartly refocused on the far more relevant themes of mental health and isolation rather than online bullying. Buoyed by the visible passion of director and cast and led by strong performances, “Chatroom” proved a surprisingly moving production.
Its story is simple. Jim (Ali L. Astin ’19), a depressed teenager, seeks companionship in a chatroom supposedly populated by fellow residents of the Chiswick area. There, he encounters Jack (Federico Roitman ’18) and Emily (Audrey S. Thorne ’19), who are timid, conscientious teens with their own struggles, as well as William (Kimberly E. Osagie, a student at the Graduate School of Education) and Ava (Karoline K. Xu ’16), who are power-hungry bullies. He has previously spoken, in a more formal online therapy setting, with Laura (Inaara Shiraz ’19). The bullies convince Jim that they want the best for him and try to convince him to commit suicide; the other characters object.
Especially considering the script’s threadbare characterizations and unrelenting melodrama, the depth with which Herring and the cast imbued these characters was nothing short of miraculous. The online gimmick raised a further challenge: For the duration of the play, the actors sat on glowing blue boxes and stared straight into the audience, so they were deprived of the use of their bodies and of eye contact. Yet each created surprisingly believable characters. Although the whole cast clearly cared deeply about the show, Astin especially seemed to pour herself into her role: Sporting an impressive Chiswick accent, her Jim was acutely earnest and convincingly desperate. Her powerful presence at center stage helped to mitigate the script’s flaws and to build tension through the gripping climax. Osagie portrayed William with enough malice to make for a sufficiently strong villain, but she also gave him a subtle vulnerability beneath his vicious exterior. Again, she succeeded not because of but in spite of the script.
Staging decisions had more mixed results. The bare-bones set—just boxes and a projection screen—successfully brought the eerie, dissociated world of the chatrooms to life. The lighting, designed by Casey R. Goggin ’19, was simple but well-conceived: Lights shone on the “online” characters and went dark to indicate logging off, an effective device in converting the digital world to that of the stage. Additionally, the intense, full-front lighting augmented the actors’ facial movements, which was especially important given their aforementioned physical constraints. Scenes were demarcated by music and projections of a static pattern. Herring's musical choices were mostly puzzling: Early in the show, the soundtrack was unhelpfully melodramatic; later, it was the Green Day song “Good Riddance,” which was simply dissonant. He redeemed himself, in this regard, at the show’s conclusion with Frankie Laine’s “Rawhide,” which served as a defiant exclamation point. The static projection, designed by Roitman (who performed admirably as Jack), was unnecessary and a bit distracting, though essentially harmless.
The original “Chatroom” was fundamentally not about mental illness. It played primarily to mid-2000s fears about the sinister dangers of the internet’s anonymity, which, thanks to Facebook, seem obsolete. But Herring here transformed it into a heartfelt portrait not of people’s malicious tendencies but of their vulnerabilities, their better angels, and their hope in the face of despair. A sadly relevant commentary, the HRDC’s “Chatroom” was an impressively compelling adaptation.

CORRECTION: March 11, 2016, at 3:30 p.m.
A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Federico Roitman ’18 and incorrectly stated that Austin B. Weber ’19 designed the music for “Chatroom.”

Yesterday I watched “Beasts of No Nation,” and I cried. I couldn’t tell you the last time I cried at a movie. Hell, it’s been a while since I’ve cried at all. Yet “Beasts of No Nation” induced tears.
I didn’t cry at the scenes where you’d expect me to cry. When the protagonist, a young boy named Agu, witnesses the murdering of his family, I didn’t cry. When Agu is forced by his commanding officer to kill innocent women and children, I didn’t cry. When Agu was raped by his commander, I didn’t even shed a tear. Oddly, I cried during the happy ending. I cried when Agu rushes into the ocean with his friends, a moment that signifies growth and the prospect of hope.
Obviously, the scenes of terror and war were appalling. But how could I have a visceral reaction to something that is so far removed from me? For God’s sake, I was intermittently scrolling through Tinder during part of the movie. I can’t see a greater contrast in the state of Agu’s life and mine than that. Regardless, I was able to relate to Agu in the last scene because it highlights the intense emotional isolation he feels from the rest of mankind.
Even though my bougie concerns about my identity and the "self" are nothing in comparison to Agu's concerns about war atrocities and child abuse, I think there's something significant about the fact that both of us, each in our very different worlds, feel totally isolated from those around us. And because of that, I'm able to connect with him, someone whose life is so different from my own. But the difference between Agu and me is that my isolation is self-imposed. It’s a choice.
There is Me, and then there is Them.
If prompted, I will undoubtedly tell you I am a nonconformist, and that I actively choose to be this way because it forces me to truly believe what I believe rather than simply accept the status quo. It is a better way of being, as it results in constant questioning that in turn leads to a more refined person. I don’t believe in bending my will to others’, as I think this is a denigration of self. Most people would describe me as aloof, standoffish, and (hopefully) righteous. And to the few who know me well, I am heartfelt and vulnerable. Unafraid to be unabashed, liberated in the short-reaching arms of my inner circle. I pride myself on this vulnerability, as I think that it elevates me and makes me more genuine.
When I saw Agu jump into the water, I cried because I was inspired. Agu’s decision to play with his peers against his instinctive defensive isolation challenged my conception of vulnerability. Am I truly vulnerable for being completely real to a few, but aloof to the majority? Is this strength? Is this righteousness? I used to believe the vulnerability was the ability to show your heart to a person, fully aware that they could choose to either caress it or stab it. That choosing to be vulnerable with someone was the bravest thing that a person could do.
But it’s one thing to be vulnerable with someone, and a whole other thing to be vulnerable every day, with everyone. That’s what Agu does. And that makes me cry.
If a nine year old can live  through countless horrors and still be brave enough to be vulnerable with the entire world, I can sure as hell do so too. Any conception I have of the world as heartless or cold may be true, but that doesn’t mean I should run away from it. If anything, true strength comes from authenticity in a shelter-less environment, being genuine despite the pain that may come from it. I want to emulate the bravery of Agu in my daily life, regardless of how scary it is to trust others.
Yet even as I write this, I am fearful. I am fearful of admitting weakness to a group of unknown people. I am scared of the judgment that will arise from my description of myself.  More than anything, I think I am fearful that I will not follow my own advice. That I will turn inwards to shield myself from the world, to protect my values from the influences of The Other. I’m concerned that this realization won’t spark genuine growth because I’m having it while I watch a fictional movie, on a computer screen, sitting on my bed, eating Samoas. Hardly the environment to have life-changing revelations. I’m concerned that this won’t give rise to progress to a better Jamie.
The cards are in my hands, and only I decide whether this realization is ephemeral or lasting. Whether this is growth or retreat will be wholly settled in my actions and thoughts in the future. This is both liberating and anxiety inducing, and I’ve done enough wondering for now.
I’m going to go hang out with some friends.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday morning, Harvard will be celebrating its very own holiday: Housing Day. 
Freshmen will eagerly wait in their dorms as upperclassmen storm the yard, dancing and screaming, sounding horns and striking gongs.
I still clearly remember the anticipation I felt before my first Housing Day last year, a day that many promised would be the best of my college career. But unfortunately, I spent the days before Housing Day anticipating something else that would be happening on that Thursday: a history midterm.
Because freshmen are assigned to their Houses immediately before Spring Break, a midway point in the semester, many professors schedule exams that coincide with Housing Day. And this is not out of malicious intent: Some faculty members are unaware of what this Harvard holiday even is. Still, Housing Day examinations preclude a large number of students from fully partaking in the day’s and preceding night’s festivities. They force freshmen to spend hours vacillating among a number of mediocre options: waking up at 6 a.m. to study, barricading themselves in their blockmates’ bedrooms to skim review sheets a final time, or not participating in the celebrations of Housing Day at all.
It is time for the administration to address the problem of exams on Housing Day by implementing a policy that allows students to fully experience the excitement of Housing Day without being forced to think about the work they should or need to be doing. The administration should ban Housing Day exams.
Though the Harvard College website itself advertises Housing Day as “one of the most exciting and festive days of the year,” what it fails to mention is that the administration has seemingly taken no steps to ensure that students can actually enjoy these festivities. More than a year after former Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 included abolishing exams on Housing Day in their campaign platform, nothing has changed.
Harvard is a stressful environment. It is often impossible to go through a week without feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of pages of reading, response papers, and problem sets to finish. As a result, there are few days when students feel like they attend a somewhat normal school—one where your close friend doesn’t need to pencil you into her schedule for a 45-minute lunch date, a school where students are able to spend 24 consecutive hours not doing school work without feeling guilty about it.
Two days every year make me feel like I’m attending a college where work isn’t constantly on everyone’s mind: Harvard-Yale game day (and weekend) and Housing Day. The solution for relieving the stress of a Monday midterm during Harvard-Yale weekend is relatively simple: Prohibit professors from giving exams the Monday after the big game. If students did not have Monday exams after Harvard-Yale weekend to worry about, they would be able to take advantage of the festivities of the weekend stress-free. Maybe they could even take Sunday off to celebrate the weekend with friends.
Likewise, Harvard should institute a midterm ban on Housing Day. If this is an infeasible option—though it is difficult to imagine why professors could not be barred from giving midterms the day before Spring Break—there are alternative options the College could explore. For instance, Housing Day could be moved to a different day, perhaps the Saturday after Spring Break. If this plan proves problematic, Housing Day could take place after the conclusion of classes.
Two years ago, Dean Rakesh Khurana described Housing Day as “one of those pure joy days.” He continued: “And I think the students deserve a couple of crazy days during the year.” While I do not doubt his words, it is hard to experience a day of “pure joy” when 25 percent of your grade is being determined by a midterm.
Harvard—let us have our day of fun.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over Junior Parents Weekend, parents and family members of 12 first-generation College students had the opportunity to come to Cambridge on Harvard’s dime to record interviews with their children. The Bureau of Study Counsel and StoryCorps, a national oral history organization, collaborated to make the initiative possible. The recordings of the first-generation students and their families will soon be made available in the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, where they will be accessible to the public.
First-generation students, the first in their families to attend college, often face a unique set of challenges. Thirty percent of students in higher education today are first-generation; many of them also come from low-income households.
Many first-generation students are disadvantaged because they lack information about the college experience taken for granted by students who grew up in families where college is the norm. First Lady Michelle Obama articulated this asymmetry well when speaking about her own challenges as a first-generation student: “I didn’t know how to choose my classes or find the right classrooms. I didn’t even know how to furnish my own dorm room.”
Given these considerable obstacles, it is essential that first-generation students at Harvard and other colleges receive support. The Junior Parents Weekend project is the latest of several recent initiatives at Harvard that have worked to empower first-generation students, and it deserves recognition for beginning to create a body of knowledge on the first-generation experience that will benefit future students.
Other programs, often catalyzed by first-generation students themselves, have had similar positive effects. Last month, Harvard hosted the 1vyG conference, which gave first-generation students from all eight Ivy League schools the opportunity to share their experiences and hear from experts in breakout sessions. Harvard’s support for the conference, largely organized by students, stands alongside initiatives like its new spring break dining plan as positive steps that will help to alleviate the challenges that many first-generation students face.
We encourage Harvard to continue improving the college experience for first-generation students on campus. Mather’s designation of a dedicated first-generation tutor, for example, could be replicated at other houses. First-generation students also face many practical obstacles, such as the cost of books and the difficulties associated with transitioning to college. Eliminating the burden of textbook costs and offering an academic bridge program over the summer could help ease first-generation students’ acclimation to college life and build on the programs that Harvard has already undertaken.
Harvard, spurred by the advocacy of first-generation students, has made great strides toward ensuring that the first-generation experience receives adequate attention in College programming. By continuing this progress, Harvard can work toward ensuring that no student faces undue burdens to full participation in College life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Committee on Undergraduate Education scrutinized students’ access to course books—with some criticizing what they consider to be inconsistent policies among course heads—at their meeting last Wednesday.

While instructors may put course books on hold for in-library use by students, they are currently not required to do so. Undergraduate Council representative for Mather House Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, who is also a member of the UC’s Education Committee, said this lack of a consistent policy can pose problems for students.
“It seems that it largely comes down to professor preference at this point,” Gonzalez said of the choice of whether or not to provide books on reserve.
Particularly for courses with extensive reading lists, course reserves can be useful for students on financial aid, Gonzalez said, allowing them to spend less money on required books and sparing them the stress of looking for readings that are already checked out of the library.
Harvard’s financial aid package includes a book stipend under its “personal expenses” budget. Sometimes those funds aren’t adequate, nor are the books available at local bookstores, Gonzalez said.
“There’s always the possibility that the Coop will sell out of books, which happened to me several times this semester for social studies textbooks,” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez listed his own social studies course, Social Studies 10b: “Introduction to Social Studies,” as a course with many required readings but no reserved books. The course’s instructor, James T. Kloppenberg, said he was new to teaching the course, but that his predecessors’ experiences had suggested there was not much demand for reserves.
“First, almost all of these texts are classics that are readily available, in multiple copies, in the Harvard library system,” Kloppenberg wrote in an email. “Second, students who want to purchase them can buy or rent them at the Coop or buy them inexpensively on the used book market. Third, most of these texts are now available electronically, either on the course i-site or through the Harvard library system.”
Daniel E. Lieberman, who chairs the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology and is a member of the CUE, said low demand for course reserves is not an adequate reason to withhold them.
“I just think we should bend over backwards to make sure that the books that we offer should be on reserve,” Lieberman said. “It’s a matter of principle.”
Gonzalez and UC Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18, who is also a CUE member, said the UC would continue to work with the CUE and with library administrators to look for ways to increase student access to course books.
“Our next steps include meeting with people who are involved with the library committee so they’re aware of our position and so we can hear more from them,” Ely said.
Associate University Librarian Susan M. Fliss wrote in an email that the library “puts all faculty requests on reserve.”

UPDATED: March 9, 2016, at 1:00 a.m.
In sixth grade, Quentin E. Neroes ’19 found himself drawn into the orbit of astrophysics, a field he discovered through Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s “Nova ScienceNow” show on PBS. In high school, after realizing he had no opportunities to study astronomy, Neroes researched the topic online, waiting for the chance to study it formally in college.
The reality when he arrived at Harvard, however, was quite different from what he had hoped to find. Lacking a firm background in mathematics, Neroes struggled to keep up with his classmates in the introductory course for his intended field, Astronomy 16: “Stellar and Planetary Astronomy.”
“When I got into my astronomy class last semester, I was virtually lost the entire time, learning as I was doing the work,” Neroes said. “It’s not the best way to do things.”
Neroes attended high school in the Dallas Independent School District, which in 2008 had the seventh-worst dropout rate of any urban school district in the United States, according to the Dallas Morning News. He said his preparation in mathematics was “not up to par” with that of his classmates at Harvard. The absence of a proper foundation in math has made college a lot more difficult, he said. 
“Astrophysics takes a lot of math—a lot of math,” he said.
Neroes’ case may not be so uncommon. A report released in November by the College’s diversity and inclusion working group found that some concentrations’ presupposing of background knowledge—particularly in the “STEM” fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—created an “unintentional exclusion” for students without strong preparation in math.
The report also came amid ongoing discussions about undergraduate students’ mathematical literacy, which the new program in General Education seeks to improve. According to Mathematics professor Robin Gottlieb, the number of students who place into the lowest-level math courses—namely Math M and Math 1—make up a “sizeable percentage” of the freshman class. While she was unable to disclose the exact number, Gottlieb said more than a quarter of freshmen placed into these courses.
“That might be what’s motivating the College to be thinking about having some sort of quantitative reasoning course,” Gottlieb said. “It seems like a little work on that would help a lot of people.”
Introductory courses like Astronomy 16 act as both gateways and barriers  into Harvard’s STEM-based concentrations, as low-level courses increasingly are tasked with catching students up to their peers.
CATCHING UP
Most STEM concentrations draw from a strong foundation in mathematics. Because so many concentrations require at least basic calculus, students who hope to study STEM fields must cover a lot of ground early on, said Katherine L. Penner ’07, a teaching assistant in Mathematics who helps lead the introductory courses Math M and Math 1.
“The thing that we are really trying to combat is this impression that you have to be at ‘X’ math level at ‘T’ time in order to be a chemist, in order to be a biologist, in order to be an economist, in order to be an engineer,” Penner said. “It is so depressing to have students come in and say, ‘I want to be a physicist’… and then they hear, ‘if I’m not at a certain point by a certain time this isn’t on the list of options for me.’”
Students who place  into the lowest-level math courses can reach the level of their peers, Penner said, though she noted the process is difficult.
“For students who are coming in with a weak background, which is a surprisingly high number of students, it is an extremely challenging adjustment,” Penner said, referring to Harvard’s introductory math courses. “We teach at a very quick pace compared to high school; it’s one unit every day, and we meet three times a week.”
While Penner said instructors for introductory math courses, particularly Math M, emphasize that no prior knowledge should be necessary, some students said they sometimes struggled alone with concepts they had never been taught in high school.
Salash T. Nabaala ’18, a joint concentrator in Physics and Mathematics, said the math curriculum of his high school in Kenya was very limited. Still, he wanted to study the subject and chose to pursue math and physics outside the classroom.
At Harvard, he placed into Math 1b, but chose instead to take a more challenging calculus course, Math 23: “Linear Algebra and Real Analysis I,” during his freshman fall. Despite the fact that Nabaala was a member of the Kenyan delegation to the Pan-African Mathematics Olympiad, he still found instructors incorrectly assumed he was familiar with certain math topics.
“I had to go outside the class to spend some time going through the assumptions made before I could get to the material,” Nabaala said. “I had to spend that extra time to bridge the gap.”
For Neroes, who placed into Math 1b, the prospect of taking several additional semesters to catch up in mathematics was daunting. Penner said it is important that instructors reinforce the idea that even students in Math M can go on to study at the highest levels of their respective fields.
“I refer to [students’] future in mathematics constantly,” Penner said. “They roll their eyes at me so hard, but I am relentless about it. It’s not impossible. You are acquiring the skills to get better.”
The perception that catching up is impossible is a major obstacle for students who want to enter the field but have weak math skills, both Penner and Gottlieb said.
“I think people are sometimes intimidated before they even begin, before they’ve given themselves a chance at it,” Gottlieb said. “There’s a lot of ideas that you can’t possibly do things that you actually can do.”
For Penner herself, who graduated from the College in 2007 and did not have much math preparation in high school, poor grades freshman year nearly ended her career in mathematics.
“I quit. I told myself that this was as far as I’d get, and then leave the field,” Penner said. “Clearly that worked out well for me.”
BARRIERS TO ENTRY
Though Harvard’s introductory math courses aim to prepare students for applied fields like physics and engineering, some students said they continue to feel overwhelmed by the mathematical requirements of those concentrations.
For Neroes, math is the largest barrier to his success in Astrophysics.
“I can understand physics concepts,” Neroes said. “But when it comes to incorporating the math into it, that’s where it gets difficult.”
Physics instructors and administrators are well aware of this barrier to entry, according to Logan S. McCarty, director of Physical Sciences Education, a field that encompasses the life sciences, Physics, Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Earth and Planetary Sciences.
“Physics in particular is challenging for students if they don’t have some prior preparation,” McCarty said, noting that the requirements for Astrophysics are slightly different than those for Physics. “If you’re starting at the most elementary level courses, it’s challenging to go through the entire sequence.”
McCarty said that experience in mathematics is the greatest limiting factor for prospective students in the physical sciences, noting that instructors require and presuppose some familiarity with calculus.
“Our current model assumes that students have the math preparation before they can take the physics course,” McCarty said.
Other concentrations like Computer Science have similar math requirements, according to the department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies Harry R. Lewis ’68. In recent years, however, the CS Department has moved to structure its concentration to accommodate students with less math experience.
“We are very careful in our curricular requirements to make sure that a student who starts even in Math M is able to complete all of the mathematical requirements, which are real,” Lewis said. “You have to take significant math to major in Computer Science, but you don’t have to come in with lots of math.”
Still, for students like William A. Greenlaw ’17, a first-generation college student, a lack of computer science in high school made the department’s popular introductory course, CS50, more difficult for him.
“In many ways I struggled to understand the concept of zeroes and ones at the very basic level,” Greenlaw said. “In the absence of that rigorous college preparatory coursework in high school, you’ll be preparing for college at college when you get here, and it becomes more difficult.”
Other STEM fields that do not initially require higher-level math, like the Life Sciences, have seen success in attracting students with less math and science experience, McCarty said.
The instructor for Life Sciences 1b: “Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution,” Andrew Berry, pointed to the creation of Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” more than 10 years ago as a step toward making Life Sciences more welcoming to a range of students.
“LPSA was invented because it was clear there was a constituency in LS1a in particular who struggled because there was too much being assumed in terms of background,” Berry said.  “The starting point [in LPSA] is that we’re going to assume that you know nothing.”
Students in LPSA should have covered roughly the same concepts as their peers in LS1a by the end of the term, Berry said—or at least be prepared enough to move forward in the field.
However, not all students for whom LPSA might be helpful choose to take advantage of the course. Hunter C. Richards ’18, who studies engineering, said she followed the example of her peers, most of whom were taking LS1a.
“Everybody else was doing LS1a and I didn’t know what I was supposed to be doing, so I went with it,” Richards said. “Once I got there, I realized most of my classmates had been working in labs for years in high school and I hadn’t even used a pipette yet.”
Richards’ experience as a first-generation college student has made her engineering career more difficult, she said. Without the same parental guidance some of her peers have had, Richards said she has struggled to plan her course of study in the sciences.
“I can’t really ask my mom about really anything about college since I’m the first one in my family in my area to go to college,” Richards said. “As a first-gen student, I’ve been interested in seeing more done to help facilitate more students getting into fields like STEM because it’s really difficult to navigate alone.”

Free pancakes will draw students and locals to the IHOP in Harvard Square Tuesday to celebrate the chain’s 11th annual National Pancake Day.
The event draws hundreds of attendees from the local area, according to Milan Basnet, general manager of the Harvard Square location.
“National Pancake Day is the biggest day, I would say, in IHOP history,” Basnet said. “Last year, we sold around 1,300 free pancakes and the line was more than 300 people.”

Many of the customers that come to the event are college and high school students, according to Basnet.
Ik Hoon Jung ’19, for one, is "definitely going to go" to IHOP for National Pancake Day,
“It sounds really cool,” Jung said. “I don’t even like pancakes all that much, but free pancakes?”
In exchange for a free short stack of buttermilk pancakes, IHOP asks its customers to consider donating to the Boston Children’s Hospital Trust, the philanthropic arm of Boston Children’s Hospital.
Basnet pitched the pancake extravaganza as an opportunity for young people to give back.
“It’s an approach to a better society,” he said. “I think it’s all of our responsibility to help a little bit.”
Jung said he was excited that funds from Harvard Square’s IHOP would go to local children through Boston Children’s Hospital Trust.
“I think it’s really awesome they’re doing this, for both the customers and for the community,” he said. “Anything helps right? I think taking the initiative to help the [Boston] Children’s Hospital is really good.”
The charity expressed enthusiasm about their continued partnership with the restaurant chain.
“They’ve been great supporters of Boston Children’s Hospital as our local Children’s Miracle hospital,” Charles Savicki, a representative of hospital fundraising organization Children’s Miracle Network, said of the collaboration with IHOP.
According to Savicki, donations will go to support children in the greater Boston area, which the hospital serves.
“Children from all the communities where IHOP has its locations in New England are served by Boston Children’s [Hospital],” he said. “Those patients are coming from towns all across Massachusetts, all across New England, all across the entire country, and the entire world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Businessman Donald J. Trump may have won the Republican primary in Massachusetts last Tuesday, but in Cambridge, Ohio governor John R. Kasich was the winner.
In Cambridge, Kasich earned 34 percent of the Republican vote as Trump trailed him with 25.2 percent, according to data compiled and published online by the Boston Globe. That result stands in stark contrast to the final statewide tally, in which Trump came away with a commanding 49.3 percent of the 631,395 Republican votes cast. Kasich finished a distant second in Massachusetts with just 18 percent. 
Massachusetts’ Democratic primary was much closer, with former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton earning 50.1 percent of 1,204,927 Democratic votes cast, barely edging out Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who garnered 48.7 percent.
Clinton had a slightly larger lead in Cambridge, where she received 53.3 percent of the vote, seven percent more than Sanders.
Some Harvard students spent the days leading up to the primary, held on the same day as 11 other state contests as part of “Super Tuesday,” working to get out the vote for their favored candidates.
James Pindell, a political reporter for The Boston Globe, said voting results in Cambridge are not indicative of broader statewide trends, and that the close finish between Sanders and Clinton reflected the immense effort both candidates expended trying to target Massachusetts’ white, working-class neighborhoods.
“Massachusetts has this reputation of white liberal elite, but Massachusetts politically is not so much Cambridge and metro west areas that tend to be more liberal elite,” Pindell said. “[Massachusetts is] much more driven by blue-collar white working class… in terms of those voters, Bernie and Hillary were directly competing.”
Pindell said Massachusetts would have been the “biggest prize” of the five states Sanders’ campaign hoped to carry on Super Tuesday, and added that the candidate’s failure to do so bodes extremely poorly for his future.
“Massachusetts was pretty much [Sanders’] last stand; he had to win here,” Pindell said. “He has the money to stay in, and clearly his supporters want him to stay in, but, after losing Massachusetts, it’s hard to see how he will win the nomination.”
Despite losing Massachusetts on Super Tuesday, Sanders did pull out wins in four other states. Harvard professors, however, said the results of the multiple primaries held that day likely solidified Clinton’s standing as the Democratic Party’s likely nominee.
According to Politico, Clinton now has 63 state delegates from Massachusetts, ahead of Sanders’ 46.
On the GOP side, Pindell said he was not surprised by Trump’s outsized victory and Kasich’s second-place finish. Pindell credited Trump with “putting in the time here,” noting that the business mogul held four events in the state over the past year, including his recent rally at University of Massachusetts Lowell in January.
Kasich narrowly beat Florida Senator Marco A. Rubio, who ended close behind him with 17.9 percent of the vote, and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who came in fourth with just 9.6 percent. Trump now has 22 delegates from Massachusetts, while Kasich and Rubio each picked up eight apiece.
Though Rubio has gained national attention as a potential “establishment” candidate who could make strides against Trump, Pindell described Kasich’s victory over Rubio in Massachusetts as “just another example where Rubio struggled” on Super Tuesday.
Still, Massachusetts is a state that could “easily align with Rubio,” Pindell said, suggesting that Rubio’s failure to gain more of the Republican vote was likely due to the candidate’s lack of presence in the state.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former employee of Harvard University pled guilty on Feb. 29 to all charges related to his alleged use of a Harvard-issued employee credit card for personal expenses.
Waltham, Massachusetts resident Shawn Bunn—who was formerly employed in a University-owned computer lab—was ordered by a judge to pay $80,000 in restitution to Harvard for larceny, forgery, and false entry in corporate books committed with his University credit card
A court-authorized search of the defendant’s residence yielded a laundry list of items illegally bought with University money, including several Apple products, Nintendo Wii controllers, hundreds of DVDs and CDs, and several Star Wars-themed Lego sets.
The Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services department first discovered Bunn’s embezzlement in a University-wide audit last year, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga said earlier this fall.
“For four years the defendant used Harvard University funds for his own purposes,” District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a press release from the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office after the guilty plea.
Bunn initially listed the purchase of computer equipment on Harvard documents. He then allocated funds for personal use. Over the following years, he embarked on multiple buying sprees, purchasing largely domestic items as varied as a table saw and a Dr. Who Tardis cookie jar, according to the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office.
Bunn had been employed by Harvard University for 17 years prior to his convictions of larceny, false entry in corporate books, and uttering of forged documents.
In addition to restitution, Bunn has been sentenced to two years in jail, followed by 10 years of probation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2016, at 11:50 a.m.
A months-long debate over Harvard Law School's controversial seal came to an uncertain close Friday, when a committee recommend the University replace it. But in the wake of the committee's lofty suggestion to retire the seal, alumni and affiliates responded with range of opinions on Royall family's crest, which the school has used for roughly 80 years and, for some, echoes of slavery.
While Law School affiliates agree that the committee’s recommendation to change the school’s seal was the expected result of a fair process, they remain divided over the recommendation itself.
A committee comprised of students, faculty, staff, and alumni released a recommendation Friday to change the school’s controversial seal, which has displayed the crest of the formerly slave-owning Royall family since its adoption in 1937. 
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow created the committee in mid-November in response to calls for the seal's removal by student activist group Royall Must Fall, whose members argued the seal’s association with slavery contributed to an inhospitable environment for minority students at the school. Friday’s recommendation, as well as a dissenting opinion from two committee members, was sent to members of the Harvard Corporation, who will make a final decision on the matter.
Now that the committee’s work has concluded, many Law School affiliates said the process was respectful and engaged a range of perspectives.
“I have found from the responses that I’ve received that many people...respect the care and respect with which the committee conducted itself, and often compliment us on having handled a difficult task in a fair and open and reasoned fashion,” committee chair and Law School professor Bruce H. Mann said.
Not all of the feedback Mann has received has been supportive of the change. He said he has received responses on both sides of the issue and called disagreement "inevitable."
"Whichever way we recommended, it was a certainty we would disappoint some people," Mann said. "Which was why we worked very hard to make sure that the process was as open and transparent and inclusive as possible."
For activists, the committee’s recommendation was an unsurprising victory. “It was exactly what I expected all along,” President of the Black Law Students Association Leland S. Shelton said. “After talking to some alumni and members of the Corporation, I had the feeling that the people who were defending the seal were few and far between. So I assumed that the committee would do their due diligence and write a thoughtful report about moving forward with a new shield.”
However, activists said they were disappointed the letter from Minow accompanying the report did not mention their efforts. “It totally elides over all of the tireless hard work that student activists, staff members, faculty members from across the University have been putting in day in and day out to make this happen,” Aparna Gokhale, a member of the group Reclaim Harvard Law, said.
Since Friday, Law School affiliates and the wider world have taken to social media to support or denounce the decision. Minow sent a letter to alumni on Friday with links to the report and dissent, as well as her endorsement of the committee’s recommendation.
Morgan Chu–a major donor to the Law School who graduated in 1976 and who previously served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University's second-highest governing body–praised both the committee process and the recommendation itself. He said he would have voted in favor of discarding the seal, and hopes the Corporation will do so.
“I don’t think in the balance of all the variables that might be considered that the reasons to keep it were as strong as the reasons to retire it,” Chu said.
Sharon E. Jones ’77, a former president of the Harvard Law School Association who graduated in 1982, was one of the many alumni who weighed in on the issue during the committee’s deliberation process. “I felt the Law School did the right thing,” she said. “They could put it in a museum, and that way you preserve whatever history you want to say it represents. I think that it stands for things that the Law School no longer wants to stand for.”
Bertram H. Fields—a major donor who graduated in 1952—said he does not have strong leanings one way or another. He distinguished between the sheaves of wheat on the Royall crest and symbols like the Confederate flag. “I’m not that moved by the argument since it’s not a blatant symbol of slavery,” he said.
Marcia L. Narine, who graduated from the Law School in 1992, was part of a group of student activists who did not collect their diplomas at commencement in order to protest a lack of minority faculty at the school. As a former activist during a turbulent time in the Law School’s history, Narine said she did not view the shield itself as a pressing concern, but she was impressed with the attention administrators awarded it, a response she said she felt was markedly different from that of administrators when she was a student.
While students with dissenting opinions also commended administrators’ open approach, third-year Law student William H. Barlow, who has publicly decried activism at the school, said activists have created an environment that silences opposing voices.
“There’s tremendous amounts of social pressure, especially in a university that leans heavily left, to not say anything that could be perceived as offensive or hurtful. A lot of people have chosen to stay out of the debate because they don’t want to be called a racist,” Barlow said. “I know there are a lot of people who feel very constrained about how they can speak on campus, and they see this as a victory for a cause that they feel is silencing them.”
Activists emphasized that no matter what the Corporation decides, the end of the Royall crest as the school’s symbol will not mark an end to their activism.
Royall Professor of Law and committee member Janet Halley said many related issues were raised during the committee’s discussions, but the body’s work was limited in scope to the question of the seal.
“By no means did our charge close the chapter on Isaac Royall and racial inclusion at the Law School,” Halley said. “Those discussions need to continue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a weekend of firsts, the Harvard baseball team faced a few new squads for the first time in program history at a tournament at Wake Forest, where losses to Richmond on Friday and Towson on Sunday bookended a Saturday sweep of Saint Peter’s and the Demon Deacons (9-3).
Sophomore third baseman John Fallon hit his first two career home runs on the way to six hits and five runs batted in on the weekend. Freshman first baseman Pat McColl, filling in for injured junior Matt Hink, started his career in style, recording six hits in 14 at-bats while driving in four runs.
“As a team we definitely showed a lot of potential,” said freshman center fielder Ben Skinner, who started all four games over the weekend. “I don’t think our record necessarily reflected how well we did…. We definitely have areas of our game to improve to get us to the next level, but this is a good group and we could definitely do something special.”
TOWSON 6, HARVARD 5
The Crimson (2-2) suffered a close defeat at the hands of the Tigers (2-7) on Sunday, with freshman Kevin Stone recording a four-plus inning loss in his debut outing. The Connecticut native allowed six runs—five earned—while striking out three.
A two-run single by McColl knotted things up at two in the bottom of the second before Fallon hit the next pitch down the left field line for a two-run double, handing Harvard a 4-2 lead after two frames.
Towson, however, recorded two runs in both the third and fifth innings to grab a one-run lead. While a combination of three Crimson pitchers combined for five scoreless innings in relief of Stone, Tigers’ long reliever Kyle Stricker blanked Harvard over six and two-thirds innings to shut the door.
“I think that’s a game that we definitely could and should have won,” Skinner said. “We came out a little flat, especially coming off a big win against Wake Forest. I don’t think the same energy and intensity was there.”
HARVARD 6, WAKE FOREST 3
The Crimson used a four-run second inning to breeze past ACC contenders Wake Forest (8-3) late in the game on Saturday, with junior  Nick Gruener picking up the win thanks to six strong innings where he allowed three runs.
Gruener allowed two in the bottom of the first, but Harvard responded immediately in the top of the second, using three straight doubles from junior shortstop Drew Reid, freshman left fielder Trent Bryan, and Skinner to plate four and take a 4-2 lead.
“A lot of times in baseball, especially early on in a game, the other teams scores two run, a lot of teams could crumble right after that,” captain D.J. Link said. “But if you can capitalize quickly and rebound quickly like we did in the second inning, it’s huge. It was nice to see us react quickly and jump on them.”
The Demon Deacons pulled one back in the third but RBIs from senior second baseman Mitch Klug and McColl in the top of the seventh provided ample insurance for senior reliever Nick Scahill. Scahill fanned six of the ten batters he faced in three no-hit innings to record the save.
HARVARD 7, ST. PETER’S 1
The Crimson rolled past the Peacocks (1-6) behind seven strong innings from senior ace Sean Poppen, who struck out 10 batters in seven innings of one-run ball.
“He pitched great,” Link said. “First time out, he was hitting all his spots. The umpire was giving the outside corner a little bit, and he recognized it.”
Fallon got things started strong, driving a two-run home run over the left field wall with one out to spot Poppen a two-run lead. That’s all the Virginia native would need, as he allowed just five base runners all night.
Klug would add a home run of the solo variety in the bottom of the seventh to extend the lead to five before freshman catcher Devan Peterson drove in the first run of his Harvard career with a sacrifice fly in the eighth.
RICHMOND 9, HARVARD 2
The Crimson opened its season with a loss against the Spiders resulting from a seven-run inning for the Atlantic 10 side. Sophomore Ian Miller was credited with the loss; after going six innings and allowing just a single run, he was tagged for four more in the seventh before he could record the first out.
“We came out pretty strong, and I think that even though we lost that game, we pretty much had one bad inning,” Link said. “Other than that, we actually played a pretty solid game.”
A Reid double opened the scoring in the fourth before Richmond tied things at one in the bottom of the fifth. The floodgates opened in the seventh, however, and Fallon’s first career home run in the top of the eighth was cancelled out promptly by a Doug Kraeger solo shot in the bottom of that same inning.
Harvard recorded 10 hits but could only score two, leaving five runners stranded in scoring position.
“I think we definitely didn’t capitalize enough on our scoring positions,” Skinner said. “I felt that we hit a lot of hard balls that weren’t finding holes and were hit straight at people. That happens in baseball, but hopefully they’ll start falling.”

Prepare yourselves. We’re about to experience a HEAT WAVE. Sort of. On Wednesday, local meteorologists forecast the temperature will reach over 70 degrees Fahrenheit (That’s 294 Kelvin for everyone taking Physical Sciences 1 and 11 and not tryna fail). That’s right. In between Sunday and Wednesday we will have experienced 40 degrees of variation in temperature. So what should you do to prepare for this miraculous (yet knowing Cambridge, probably short-lived) event? Flyby’s got you covered.
Clothes
First, you should definitely take advantage of this weather to break out some of those spring/summer clothes that have been gathering dust under your bed. Even if you don’t feel bold enough to throw on a pair of shorts, definitely break out those t-shirts, tank tops, and dresses. Carpe diem the heck out of this opportunity.
Be Outside (Please Get Some Sunshine)
Yes, you may still have midterms, but there’s no better time to start on glowing skin than the day before Housing Day when you may have to show it off if tasked with donning nothing but a speedo and charging the Yard. Get out there and enjoy the beautiful sun. Go sit on the steps of Memorial Church or bring a blanket and sit on the lawn in the Yard. If you’re feeling adventurous, you could make a trek down to the Charles and find a spot to sit on Weeks Bridge and watch the river flow by, much like you feel your GPA may be doing right now. In any case, the opportunities are endless.
Food
Ice cream. No one can judge you on Wednesday for eating ice cream by the pint (or everyone, because it sounds like it’s going to be a great day to jump start your summer body). So grab onto that survey HUHS just sent out which offers you a $5 J.P. Licks card in return, and eat all the ice cream (jk, $5 gets you pretty much three bites from J. P. Licks) you want in the blissful knowledge that no one (read: everyone) will give you weird looks, free of charge.
The Environment
Okay, but let’s be real. The weather this winter has been uncomfortably nice. As we enjoy the first 70 degree day of 2016, we can’t help but knowing that the Arctic is melting at a record pace. Not to be a downer, but we should probably do something about that, like summoning the ESPP concentrators to do what they do best. So take the time to turn off the lights when you’re not using them and make the effort to walk two feet farther and throw your paper in the recycling bin instead of the trash. Perhaps you might even consider shortening your 40 minute shower routine to 20 minutes.
Whatever your plans are on Wednesday, enjoy the beautiful day and rejoice that there will only be two more days left until Spring Break.

Just when you thought midterm season couldn’t get any worse, you run out of Tinder swipes. Now you’re stuck in Lamont with your thirst -- errr, ambition -- levels high. Fear not, for Flyby has you covered, with options of what to do when you run out of Tinder swipes.
First of all, have you tried the other hookup apps popular on campus? There’s Bumble, Jswipe and, if you’re feeling desperate, Match.com. Ladies, although Bumble requires some extra work on your part, at least that means you can avoid the awkward rejection conversation with annoying section kid from Ec10. And word on the street is that JSwipe is the place to find your future nice Jewish husband or wife, a great alternative if you’re too lazy to trek to Hillel.
The other alternatives require a little more introspection. Technically, Harvard is a college, which means that technically, we all have p-sets and papers that could hypothetically be more intellectually stimulating than Tinder. Now that we are all, at the very least, past the first semester of our freshman year, most of us have forgotten what it’s like to finish a problem set before it’s due. But this whole running out of swipes thing could be a golden opportunity to return to our overachieving high school days and remember again what it’s like to have our lives together.
If you really just want to have a good time and not study, we at Flyby have devised a revolutionary idea: spend time with real, living people. We know, we know. There are definitely some hot people out on the Tinderverse (or well-edited, well-filtered people, at the very least), and having conversations with them is an ego-booster. But Harvard students, when we actually take the time to talk to each other (plot twist, we know), can provide meaningful fulfillment and interesting conversation.
But if that fails, just go to Lamont, inhale the putrid scent of despair and loneliness, and take a nap. Who needs a hot hookup when you could be sleeping. In Lamont. A public space. Now that’s what Harvard is all about.

Ivy League campus story observations: I found out that students can play everyone’s favorite (?) winter sport—curling—in the Science Center plaza. Maybe it’s time to start going to section so I can check this out. There was a power outage at Yale—though I assume that this is probably fairly common in New Haven. And somewhere (plz add geotags to all snaps so location is obvious), a student watched House of Cards during lecture... #IvyLeagueEducation.
Condolences to the entire Cornell community and especially to the family of university President Elizabeth Garrett, who passed away last night after suffering from colon cancer.
Controversy at Yale seems to be the norm, and this week is no exception. Currently it’s the men’s basketball team in the spotlight. In late February, the team announced that senior captain Jack Montague was no longer on the team. On February 26th, before a game (against us), the Yale team wore shirts emblazoned with Montague’s name. Benign show of support for universally beloved captain? Not so much. The next week, posters and flyers popped up around campus with messages such as, “Rape culture is standing by your teammate and silencing victims of sexual assault.” The ex-player’s father confirmed that he had been expelled from the school, but there’s been no further word from the university or team.
Brown is on track to have another sweet spring concert after announcing that Fetty Wap, Tinashe, and Mac DeMarco will headline Spring Weekend 2016. Sadly, guests aren’t invited unless tickets don’t sell out (they will), but Flyby applauds anyone who attempts to sneak in by going undercover as a Brown student.
At Penn, there’s currently a petition for Penn Dining to increase vegan or vegetarian offerings, and discussion about whether it makes sense for students with dietary restrictions to be on the meal plan. Students complained it was “impossible to eat a protein-rich diet” and that “if you’re a vegetarian there’s really just pizza.” This sounds familiar. Can someone start something similar at Harvard? Or maybe a petition to offer an alternative to the mandatory unlimited meals all four years requirement?
Students and administrators at Dartmouth evaluate the university’s ban on hard alcohol. Senior associate dean of student affairs Liz Agosto remarked that after the ban’s implementation one year ago, they are seeing “positive trends in terms of health and safety for students.” We’re thrilled for them. Maybe they should focus on health and safety in the form of arson prevention as well—an undergrad was arrested for arson in connection with a fire in a dorm.
