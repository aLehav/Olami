After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Luke Esposito and Colin Blackwell tapped their goaltender’s pads in consolation. After yielding two goals in 10 seconds to ECAC Hockey’s conference cellar dwellers, Merrick Madsen and his teammates had a right to be stunned.
At 7:08 and 7:18 of the third period, Clarkson’s Nic Pierog and Pat Megannety scored just moments apart to cap an emphatic 5-1 victory on Saturday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, handing the No. 7/8 Harvard men’s hockey team (9-4-3, 5-3-3 ECAC) its first loss to an unranked opponent in the process.
Madsen, who started the game on the bench, was a late participant in Saturday’s surprising rout. If there was ever a time to give his freshman counterpart, Michael Lackey, another try in net, it was Saturday at home against the Golden Knights (10-10-2, 2-6-2 ECAC), a team that had entered the weekend with one win and an 0-for-29 power play against conference opponents.
Yet three straight Clarkson goals—two on the man advantage—sent Lackey to the bench and left the hosts outmatched after the game’s first 30 minutes. Save a brief Harvard push in the third period highlighted by co-captain Kyle Criscuolo’s 12th goal of the season, the Golden Knights maintained control wire-to-wire in an effort that might signal a second-half resurgence for a team that struggled with injuries to start the year.
“We felt pretty good,” Clarkson coach Casey Jones said. “We were playing our style of game; we were making it hard for them to get to the net, and we were blocking a lot of shots and jamming a lot of shots.”
On the bench opposite Jones, there wasn't too much to feel good about. A night after co-captain Jimmy Vesey’s third period hat trick heroics, the Crimson managed only 22 shots on goal en route to their worst goal-differential of 2015-2016. Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 did not spare criticism for any part of his team, which has now lost three of its last four.
“There wasn’t anything really that we did tonight that was acceptable or that would have allowed us to be competitive in that game, whether it was the basics of just one on one battles and compete level and work ethic or…actual special teams and goaltending and defensive zone coverage,” Donato said.
Skating at even strength, junior forward A.J. Fossen connected on a rebound for Clarkson’s first goal at 5:18 in the first period. Sophomore Golden Knights center Ben Dalpe sent a low slapshot in transition onto Lackey, who kicked it out to an unmarked Fossen in the low right slot.
Two more Clarkson slapshots eluded Lackey on the penalty kill in the second period.
After drawing a hooking infraction on senior defenseman Desmond Bergin, sophomore Sam Vigneault pushed past a rebound off a blast from senior defenseman Kevin Tansey at 5:18  with 12 seconds left on the man advantage.
Minutes later with sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman in the box for cross-checking, a slapper from Tansey beat Lackey cleanly to extend Clarkson’s lead to three at 9:35.
Lackey finished his night with 12 saves on 15 shots as Madsen replaced the freshman starter in net after Tansey’s goal, stopping all but two of the 19 shots he faced in relief.
Criscuolo cut into the visitors’ lead on a power play at 5:05 in the third period, tucking a feed from junior defenseman Clay Anderson around senior goaltender Greg Lewis in the low slot, but a one-two punch from Pierog and Megannety put the game out of reach shortly thereafter.
Pierog, a sophomore, broke up the right wing on a 2-on-1 before beating Madsen five-hole. Off the next face-off, Megannety created another 2-on-1 with junior forward Perry D’Arrisso and buried D’Arrisso’s rebound after Madsen kicked out the puck to his right.
“I give Clarkson credit, because I thought that they won all the foot races and they won all the battles, and we really just did not show up at the level of intensity that would have been necessary to win the game,” Donato said.
Harvard’s frustration showed in the game’s latter stages. Harvard junior Tyler Moy and Clarkson defenseman Bryan Sinz received 10-minute misconducts following an altercation at the Clarkson blue line with just over two minutes remaning. Later, an aggressive shot block attempt by Harvard freshman Ryan Donato led to roughing minors to Donato and Pierog and a 10-minute misconduct to Fossen at 19:53.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On the search for consistency, the Harvard men’s volleyball took a sizable step in the right direction on Saturday with a three-set sweep of Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne in Indianapolis. The Crimson (2-3) finished up their winter break road trip in style, sweeping the Mastodons 27-25, 25-22, and 25-21 respectively.
On two previous occasions, against No. 9 Lewis and No. 15 Ball State, Harvard had won the opening set only to fall short in the end. Against the Mastodons (2-2), however, it kept up the pressure and suffered no such lapse.
“We’ve come out strong in a few matches, which is a good quality,” coach Brian Baise said. “But you have to be able to sustain, so hopefully last night is a sign of a little bit of a maturing process for the team. As we get a few more games under our belt, learn who we are and what we can do, hopefully that will continue.”
Captain Branden Clemens led the charge once again, recording 14 kills to just one error with 25 total attacks for a hitting percentage of .520. It was Clemens’ best statistical performance of the season despite the fact that he took his second-fewest swings.
“I was really happy with my offensive performance yesterday,” Clemens said, whose two blocks put him ninth in program history in solo blocks. “I felt very in control throughout the game.… I know that I’m going to be getting the ball a lot, so I’m trying to reduce my errors while keeping the kills up. I felt like I was swinging a lot smarter and capitalizing on good sets.”
The first set was the tightest of the match, with the Crimson pushed to require 27 points to claim it. There were seventeen ties during the course of the set, with junior outside hitter Casey White closing the Mastodons out with a kill and service ace on back-to-back points.
White, whose brother DJ graduated last year as the team’s leader in kills, has embraced a more involved offensive role this season. He continued his strong start to the campaign with a double-double of 10 kills and 11 digs in Saturday’s match, adding two blocks, one solo, for good measure.
“He’s definitely looking to step up and play more of an offensive role, and he’s doing it,” Baise said. “He’s a really smart hitter, sees the court really well. He’s bailed us out of a lot of tough situations, so we’re definitely looking to him for a lot of our offense, and he’s responding, which is great.”
White has 50 kills and 62.5 points on the season, second only to Clemens on the team. He leads Harvard with 55 digs and boasts a .304 hitting percentage, leading all players with at least 75 total attacks.
The Crimson maintained its momentum into the second set, with captain Alec Schlossman’s kill giving them a 12-5 advantage. IPFW climbed back to within two, 20-18, but kills from freshman Trevor Dow and Clemens helped Harvard close the set out and take a 2-0 lead in the match.
On the brink of another mid-match hiccup, the Crimson were particularly ruthless on offense in the second set. It posted a .423 hitting percentage, well above the team’s .275 mark on the year. Offensive efficiency has been a trademark of good performances this season; Harvard has recorded .100, .325, and .237 hitting percentages in its three losses while hitting .474 and .398 in its two victories, a fact not lost on the coach.
“If you look at the matches we’ve won and the matches we’ve lost, hitting efficiency is key,” Baise said. You can tell a lot about how we’re playing as a team by that number.”
The Crimson continued to click in the third set, playing within its system and forcing IPFW into nine errors in a 25-21 victory.
“I really think that our offensive efficiency was primarily due to how well we were passing,” Clemens said. “We were handling their serves very well, and we were making sure that Marko, our setter, had all three of our hitting options available to him. When we are in system, we’re a tough team to beat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the team’s second and final home meet of the season, Harvard men’s swimming and diving finished the day with a clean sweep in its dual meet against fellow Ivy league squads, Penn and Brown, at Blodgett Pool on Saturday.
Coming off a winter break training trip in Saint Croix, the Crimson (6-0, 5-0 Ivy) rode 11 first place finishes in the 16 events to claim victory in dominating fashion, resulting in 237-63 and 192-108 wins against the Bears (1-3, 0-3) and Quakers (7-2, 5-2), respectively.
Penn, whose only previous loss on the season came against Princeton, 217-234, posed a clear threat to hand Harvard its first defeat in Ancient Eight competition. But the Crimson, bolstered by the excitement generated from its seniors in their final meet at Blodgett, was able to hold off the Quakers, with its sprinters setting the tone early on.
“From the first event, the 200 medley relay, the sprinters got the ball rolling with a one-two finish,” said junior Aly Abdel Khalik. “The distance swimmers put up a good fight in the 1000 and from there we just had the momentum and everything went our way.”
The 200 medley relay team of sophomore Koya Osada, freshman Sebastian Lutz, junior Max Yakubovich, and junior Paul O’Hara claimed the early win with a time of 1:29.98, just ahead of the 1:30.23 mark of the second place Harvard squad. The two groupings traded the lead throughout, but O’Hara, the anchor, sprinted to the win in 19.48, the fastest time by a decent margin in the closing leg.
The relay contingent continued to roll after the early high in the medley. In the final race of the day, the 400 freestyle relay foursome swam to the top of the podium in 2:59.89, marking the first time the team has finished faster than three minutes in the event at this dual meet in the past two years.
“[Sophomore] Ed Kim, [sophomore] Steven Tan, Paul O'Hara and Sebastian Lutz went up against one of the best sprinters in the Ivy League and walked away with a few victories,” co-captain Christian Yeager said. “Their 400 freestyle relay was extremely impressive at this point in the season.”
O’Hara and Kim also had success earlier in the day in their individual races. After swimming to first and second place in the 50 freestyle, the duo only finished behind Quaker senior Eric Schultz’s time of 45.22 in 100 yard event with O'Hara’s claiming the silver. Kim’s 45.47 mark was good enough for third.
In the longer freestyle races, freshman Logan Houck doggedly chased Ivy League stalwart, Penn senior Chris Swanson, en route to second place finishes in both the 1000 and 500 free. Competing down to the wire in the longest race of meet, the rookie posted 9:10.38 in the 1000 yard event, which was merely 0.27 seconds slower than the Quaker. Freshman Brennan Novak went on to claim bronze in both events.
“Houck went head to head with … Swanson, who is arguably the best swimmer in the Ivy League… and almost beat him," Yeager said. “[Along with the 400 free relay, this event] really got our team excited and will show the league that we are ready to compete at the highest level.”
Fellow Crimson freshman, Daniel Tran, followed up his early success as part of the second place squad in the 200 medley relay with victories in both the 100 and 200 backstroke, along with claiming a silver medal in the 200 yard individual medley by racing to a 1:50.91 mark.
Coming in after Tran in the backstroke were Osada and junior Jack Manchester as the trio helped guide Harvard to placing the top-three finishers in the 100 and 200 yard races.
On the diving side, sophomore David Pfeifer capped off the day by pulling out victories in both the one-meter and three-meter springboard events. After winning the three-meter by 52.95 points with his 347.20 showing, the sophomore again paced the field in the one-meter by besting Harvard’s usual top finisher in the event, freshman Luke Martinez, by a mere 3.70 points.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every wrestler has his kryptonite, and Harvard men’s wrestling captain, No. 7 Todd Preston, is no different. The 2014 EIWA Championships Most Outstanding Wrestler has struggled in the past against former Blair Academy teammate Mark Grey, but Preston overcame his rival by decision on Friday night as the Crimson (2-2, 0-1 EIWA) faced off against No. 16 Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y.
Preston’s breakthrough win was not enough, however, as the higher-ranked Big Red (3-3, 2-0 EIWA) claimed a 31-14 victory at the Friedman Wrestling Center.
“It was a hurdle,” Preston said of his win. “I definitely made strides mentally because he’s always had my number—he beat me last year. But I’m not settling now because obviously there’s much tougher guys for me to accomplish my goal of being a national champion…. Being a little sick and under the weather, I was happy with my performance.”
Harvard looked poised for a potential upset, taking a 14-9 lead after five matches. Freshman Nolan Hellickson began proceedings against fellow first-year Dalton Macri, losing by fall after six minutes and 45 seconds.
“[Nolan’s] doing really well, making strides on a weekly basis,” Preston said. “That’s all we should ask for from freshmen. At the Division I level, it’s a lot different than high school. For someone to make those strides on a weekly basis…honestly that is all you can ask for. He’s putting the dedication to get better.”
The Crimson was fortunate to win by forfeit in the 133-pound class, with Cornell unable to send out an opponent for junior Jeffrey Ott. Then came Preston, who was battling an illness coming into the match, but managed to pull off a gutsy victory. The string of results put Harvard up 9-6 at the time.
Captain Patrick Hogan then faced freshman Joey Galasso, the first Philadelphia wrestler to win a state championship back in high school, in the 149-pound class. Hogan battled throughout but lost via decision, 8-2, knotting the overall score back up at nine.
Up next was sophomore Tyler Tarsi, coming into the match just 5-7 in his collegiate dual meet career. The Nazareth, Penn., native, however, showed great maturity in his win over freshman Kyle Simaz, defeating the Big Red wrestler by virtue of a technical fall. This dominant performance earned the Crimson five points, putting them up 14-9 more than halfway through the meet.
“Tyler did a great job,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “He wrestled hard, he got on top, and turned the guy. It was a close match until he got on top. It was a great match for Tyler; we’ve been waiting for him to blossom, and this was a good match for him to do that.”
From that point on, unfortunately, Harvard came up face to face with the “heart” of Cornell’s roster. Choosing not to use 18th-ranked senior Duke Pickett in the 165-pound class, the Big Red sent out fellow senior Chris Dowdy who recorded a major decision victory over freshman Peter Bearse, who had yet to wrestle in a dual meet.
In the 174 and 184-pound weight classes, Cornell boasted a couple of the nation’s top-ranked wrestlers. In the former, No. 7 Brian Realbuto won by technical fall, 16-0, over sophomore Josef Johnson. This five-point victory gave the Big Red its first lead of the night, 18-14.
No. 1 Gabriel Dean would proceed to win by fall in the 184 against senior Michael Mocco, extending Cornell’s lead to 24-14. Senior Josh Popple and junior Nicholas Gajdzik then came up short in the 197 and heavyweight classes to close out the match.
“I think we had some good training going into it,” Weiss said. “It shows us what we still need to work on. All I really wanted was for our guys to go out and fight until the whistle. For the most part, they did. Particularly the atmosphere to wrestle in a tight gym with a loud crowd... I wanted them to soak it up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Compared to last winter, which saw a record-breaking 110.6 inches of snow cover the Boston area, this winter certainly has not produced ideal ski conditions so far.
Due to the surprising lack of snow in New England, the Harvard nordic and alpine ski teams have had difficulty preparing for the 2016 season, which kicked off this weekend at the Bates Carnival in Waterville, Maine.
Despite a relative lack of preseason practice for the Crimson, however, the team managed to finish 10th overall out of 17 teams in its first competition of the season, and junior Rachel Hampton recorded her fourth career top-15 finish.
At the end of the weekend, Vermont was the top finisher at the Bates Carnival with a team score of 951. Harvard rounded out the top 10 with a cumulative score of 258.
“In general we had some mixed results, but we had a really strong showing from the sophomores on our team,” junior co-captain Kaitlyn Gibson said. “In particular, Kelly Steeves came in 30th for college athletes in the giant slalom, and she came in 27th in the slalom.”
Steeves managed to race into a 27th place finish with an overall time of 2:14.80 on the slalom. On the giant slalom she would pace in at 30th with a time of 2:26.79. On the men’s side, sophomore Pieter Weemaes battle to a 41st-place finish with a time of 2:02.49 on the slalom.
Aside from those individual performances, the Crimson’s alpine team struggled to produce top results over the weekend. Harvard competed in the women’s giant slalom and the women’s and men’s slalom, but the team did not finish in the top 10 in any event.
Although the Crimson was unsuccessful on the alpine side, the nordic team had several top finishers and helped carry Harvard to 10th place at the Bates Carnival. The women’s team finished 6th overall in the sprint and 7th overall in the 5K.
For the second straight year, Hampton recorded a 15th-place finish, this year in the sprint. She also came in 23rd in the women’s 5K.
“Rachel is a huge asset to the team, but her impact extends beyond the points she scores,” co-captain Soren Anderson said. “Her work ethic and positivity are contagious, and her advice on race strategy is always helpful.
Along with Hampton, senior Hanna Barnes helped carry the Crimson in the women’s classic sprint. The Honeoye Falls, N.Y., native placed 19th, four spots behind Hampton in a field of 104.
On the men’s side, junior Devlin Shea and sophomore Haakon Sigurslid were Harvard’s top finishers in the classic sprint. Shea placed 18th, and Sigurslid finished 28th.
Shea, a native of Waitsfield, Vt., recorded a career best in the sprint with a time of 3:36.93. Sigurslid posted the first top-30 finish of his collegiate career.
In the men’s 10K, several Crimson skiers finished in the middle of the pack. Sigurslid was Harvard’s top finisher, coming in 40th place. Behind him were junior Ian Meyer and sophomore Liam Mulshine, who placed 43rd and 47th, respectively.
After experiencing mixed results at the Bates Carnival, the Crimson will resume training and build on its limited practice time so far this year.
“I think after this weekend everybody’s feeling pretty motivated to get back to the drawing board...and get ready for the Colby Carnival in Sugarloaf next week in Maine,” Gibson said.
The absence of any substantial snow in the area prevented Harvard’s ski team from starting its January training camp on time, and on top of the limited training, several seniors are still recovering from injuries.
However, the team recently started training at Pat’s Peak in New Hampshire and is beginning to get in better shape for the season.
“Our team has a lot of potential,” Anderson said. “Our on-snow training has so far been limited by the warm weather, but we are confident in our overall fitness…. We expect to improve each week, and we hope to see our top racers advance to the NCAA Championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Gordon Indoor Track was busy this weekend hosting the Harvard Multi-Meet on Friday and the annual Beantown Challenge on Saturday. The Crimson men’s and women’s track and field teams had an impressive home opener with the women’s team placing first in the Beantown Challenge for the the fifth consecutive year and the men’s team placing third. There were a slew of personal and season bests among the 15 first-place finishes for Harvard.
BEANTOWN CHALLENGE
The Crimson rounded out its weekend holding the Beantown Challenge at home for the ninth straight year. Harvard competed against Ivy league rival Brown, and local participants UMass Amherst, Stonehill, and Boston College, among others.
“It’s a very comfortable environment—it’s people you have seen in competition before, and all your friends get to come and watch you perform,” captain Paige Kouba said. “It’s a great race to start the season, and holding on to the Beanpot Trophy is a nice confidence booster early on in the year.”
In sprints, the Crimson women dominated the field with freshmen Ngozi Musa and Gabby Thomas placing first in the 60 and 200 meter dash, respectively. Both ran collegiate bests with times of 7.56 and 24.04 seconds. Even with Thomas in only the third meet of her collegiate career, her 60 meter dash lands second in the Harvard record books and sixth in Ivy League history, only hundredths of a second away from setting a new school record. Thomas continued to impress with a second-place finish behind teammate Musa in the 60 meter dash at a time of 7.63 seconds.
There were two 1-2-3 finishes in the 200 meter dash and the 60 meter hurdles. Behind Thomas’s record setting pace in the 200 were senior Autumne Franklin and classmate Christi Scott, respectively. Franklin also took the victory in the 60 meter hurdles with juniors Jackie Modesett and Jade Miller ensuring the podium sweep.
Miller then ran for gold in the 500 meter in 1:12.95, almost three seconds faster than Boston College’s Molly McCabe in second place. Scott continued to contribute to the women’s victory with a personal record of 57.03 seconds in the 400 meter, earning her second place.
For the distance runs, Kouba ran for a personal record of 2:49.70 and first place in the 1000 meter, outpacing the competition by a whopping six seconds.
Four victories in the field events also helped to keep the women’s Beanpot trophy in Cambridge. Junior Raegan Nizdil won the high jump at 1.7 meters. Sophomore Floriane Kameni set a new personal best in the triple jump at 11.85 meters, earning her first. Silver was freshman Bola Hambolu’s color this weekend with two second place finishes in the long jump and triple jump. Freshman Nicole Trenchard and senior Lexie Schachne both cleared 3.45 meters in the pole vault, but Trenchard took home first.
“Today felt like we were a very unified team for the first time,” Kouba said. “It was great to see everyone come together.”
For the men’s team, junior Julian Nunally had a standout performance in shot put, picking up first place honors. He secured a new personal best with a 17.61 meter throw, completely obliterating his old record.
“Julian Nunally threw a personal best of eight feet in the final throw of the heat,” co-captain James Lin—a former Crimson sports editor—said, “which is absolutely massive in shot put standards.”
In the other men’s field events, junior Josh Whitener finished second in the weight throw, 0.16 meters behind Brown’s Owen Russell. Senior Spencer Lemons earned his second victory of the season in the high jump clearing 1.99 meters. Like the women vaulters, freshman Ian West and junior Andrew Roney both soared at 4.80 meters, but the gold went to West with one fewer miss in the competition.
Sophomore Alex Moore took home first and a new personal record in the 200 meter with a time of 22.50 seconds. Senior David Gawlas was right behind in third. Sophomore Jay Hebert jumped to gold in the 60 meter hurdles in 8.21 seconds.
In the distance races, freshman Kieran Tuntivate finished the mile in first after pulling away from the competition, completing the final 400 meters in 58 seconds. Senior Malik Epps and sophomore Gabe Montague placed second in the 800 and 1,000 meter races, respectfully.
HARVARD MULTI-MEET
The Crimson opened up its track for 2016 with the Harvard Multi-Meet, consisting of the women’s pentathlon and the first four events of the men’s heptathlon. It was the season debut for Harvard’s pentathlon and heptathlon athletes.
Last year, senior Madison Hansen captured the pentathlon title, but injury kept her from competing for a repeat gold. Hansen only competed in the high jump where she placed eighth. With Hansen out, UMass Lowell’s Kerstin Darsney finished in first with 3,662 points.
Mark Hill had a well-rounded performance, competing in only the first four events of the heptathlon. Hill finished first in the 60 meter dash, while taking home the bronze in the long jump and shot put events.
“It was a very, very positive week,” Lin said, “And a good step forward on our roads to Heps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Ball State and Harvard faced off in men’s volleyball last season, the Cardinals could only muster 28 kills as the Crimson earned a quick 3-0 victory on its home floor in Cambridge.
In a new year at a new venue, however, Ball State’s junior outside hitter Brendan Surane nearly matched that number singlehandedly with a dominant 20-kill performance. As Surane fared much better, so did the Cardinals squad, which finished with 62 kills.
With its powerful attack, No. 15 Ball State (3-1) dispatched Harvard (1-3) in four sets, 3-1, sending the home crowd of over 700 home happy.
The match was closer than the final score indicated, almost going to a tie-breaking fifth set. With the Crimson holding onto a slim 23-22 lead in the fourth set, Surane scored a kill and immediately followed it with a block to pull his team ahead, 24-23. Cardinals’ senior setter Hiago Garchet made sure Harvard had no time to regroup, delivering a final kill to end the game.
The Crimson thus had no win to show for its efforts for the third time in four matches, and remains winless against ranked opponents. The squad has also dropped games to No. 8 Lewis and No. 7 Hawaii this season.
“It’s been a tough stretch for us, but it’s given us a chance to see where our weaknesses are as a team,” said Harvard captain and outside hitter Branden Clemens. “There’ve been a lot of out-of-system, scrappy plays that we haven’t been making, and that’s something I want to see us do better.“
Despite the shortcomings, the team can look to its comeback in the first set as a building block for the rest of the season. After a barrage of kills by Ball State and also a few costly errors of its own, the Crimson was down 9-1 at one point in the set. Behind four kills by junior outside hitter Casey White, however, Harvard roared back to tie the game at 13.
Several more lead changes and ties later, the visitors pulled out a 25-22 win. White continued to be the key to his team’s surge, finishing the first set with seven kills.
“The guys had a ton of energy to start the game, and it showed when we battled back from that slow start,” White said. “We couldn’t really maintain that energy for the rest of the game, though.”
The Crimson never found itself in such a big hole again, but it was also never able to put together another run. The closest it came to challenging the Cardinals in the second set was when it trailed, 22-20. The set finished, 25-21.
The third set was even more one-sided, and Harvard never closed in by more than four points after falling behind, 18-14. Ball State ultimately prevailed, 25-20.
“They started to play a lot better defense after the first set.” Clemens said. “They were making a lot of really good digs and transition plays that led to points for them, and after that first set, we were never really able to answer back again.”
The biggest problem for the Crimson in the fourth set was answering the Cardinals’ runs with a big one of its own. Harvard came back from 9-5, 12-9, and 17-14 deficits, tying the match up on each occasion, but it never broke through to take a significant lead.
The Crimson finally ran out of steam after pulling ahead briefly at 23-22, when Surane and Garchet took over for Ball State.
“We knew [Surane] was one of their main guys,” White said. “Our game plan going in was to control the middle, but still, to allow one guy on the outside to get 20 kills is unacceptable for us.”
Clemens came close to 20 kills himself, as he finished with 18 of them and also 13 digs in a standout performance in front of friends and family from his home state of Indiana. White added 14 kills and 16 digs, but no other Harvard player had more than nine in either category.

We’ve all heard about famous and successful Harvard dropouts, but what about those who were rejected? Where did they go? What did they do?
We now have some insight, due to Tom Brokaw’s recent admittance to being among those who were unable to successfully get through Harvard’s admission process.
You may know him as the famed anchor from Nightly News, the author of The Greatest Generation, or the the first anchor to have one-on-one interviews with Gorbachev and Putin on American television. Now, you may also know him as a Harvard reject.
At a lunch for the movie Spotlight, Brokaw poked a bit of fun at himself, saying that if he had gone to Harvard, he would have been infinitely more successful. He then went on to say how he was only at the lunch-- which was held at a Harvard Club-- because he moderated the panel of Spotlight actors and director at the lunch. It’s okay, Tom, you don’t need an excuse to sit with us.
Another Harvard reject? Oh, just a little known man named Warren Buffett. You probably haven’t heard of him. He’s kind of a big deal in the investing world. Even after running multiple businesses before applying to college, he too received a rejection letter from Harvard. He somehow managed to bounce back and since then hasn’t done too badly for himself, as he’s amassed a mere $66 billion as a personal fortune.
Many of us here never want to think about what we would have done had we not gotten into Harvard. Would we self destruct? Would the world cease to exist as we know it? Now we know: aside from a slight deflation of our egos, we would still be okay and successful in life.
So, to all of you who did not get into Harvard, or any of your top choices: it could turn out to be a blessing in disguise. You’ll (probably) still do well no matter what other path you may choose. If Brokaw and Buffett were able to do it, so can you
