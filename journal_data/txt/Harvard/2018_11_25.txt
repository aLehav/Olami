After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 14, the Harvard Art Museums welcomed contemporary artist Cameron Rowland to discuss some of the thoughts and history behind his work. Rowland is an American artist from Philadelphia currently living and working in Queens, New York. Rowland is known for his conceptual art, and given his use of found and readymade objects, some have come to consider him the 21st century version of the infamous artist Marcel Duchamp.
Rowland spoke about the legal and economic structures that underlie life as we know it today. Much of his talk explored the lens his work takes on the idea of property and ownership. In speaking about injustices in contractuality, Rowland harkened back to slavery, sharecropping, and the Black Codes. He spoke at particular length about one of his works titled D37, which is currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. This work grapples with the injustice in property ownership faced by black communities.
“It is attempting to develop an understanding of the non-universality of property in the contingency of black contractual relations in the United States. This is the socio-historical context that I hope to situate one work included in the aforementioned exhibition that is titled D37,” Rowland said of the piece.
Rowland showed the audience a slide of D37, a framed piece displaying property documents.
Nikole Naloy ’21 spoke as one of the student board members of HAM who introduced Rowland at the talk.
“Rowland’s art exposes the underbelly of our political and economic systems, and it allows us to see the power and role art can play in this society,” Naloy said in an interview after the event.
D37 is just one example of how Rowland is able to transform objects into art.
Naloy also spoke about how Rowland takes “the most common, banal aspects of daily procedural life,” like the property registrations, and subverts their purposes by putting them in a gallery setting.
Indeed, though Rowland’s work may appear straightforward at first glance, there is so much underlying thought and provocation. Those who attended his artist talk were able to hear Rowland articulate some of these underlying thoughts in person.
Rowland’s visit to HAM is particularly exciting given that his work, U20E (2013), is currently on display in the contemporary art gallery on the first floor of the museum. The work is a readymade object — essentially a piece of steel shelving. Though it is not evident from viewing the piece, there was an incredible amount of behind-the-scenes work that went into displaying Rowland’s art. Harvard Art Museums had to conquer unfamiliar issues of liability before they could obtain the work because the piece is being loaned to HAM through the renter. Mary Schneider Enriquez ’81, the Houghton Associate Curator of Contemporary Art in the Harvard Art museum’s Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, explained the prolonged process that was involved in obtaining a rented piece of art.
“It took me a year and a half to get approval from Harvard. We had to go to the office of the general council to take on the loan of a work of art that is being rented to a collector,” she said. Though this process was difficult, it is all part of Rowland’s practice.
“The rental works against the whole idea of the system of value for art as an object, so he’s trying to open up the issue of the way the system works,” Schneider Enriquez said.
Furthermore, the work of art goes past just mounting the readymade onto the wall. For Rowland, the work not only includes the piece itself, but also the specific height and placement of the readymade in the room as well as the accompanying statement. The label must accompany the work of art. In Rowland’s talk, he mentioned this aspect of his work saying, “almost all of my works include a descriptive caption — this caption details information I consider part of the work.” The explanation that accompanies the art is what forces the viewer to think, and this aspect of thought is what Rowland finds especially important.
“Information that allows a viewer who is unaware of the role of a material within systematic operations to understand it is integral to the purpose and ethicacy of the work,” Rowland said. Though Rowland is specific about how his work is shown, he does intend the work to be viewed in “different contexts and in different sites.” Harvard Art Museums is currently one of those platforms.
For Schneider Enriquez, Naloy, and the popular turnout of people who came to hear Rowland speak, the message of Rowland’s art is impactful and intriguing. It is fortunate to have a work of Rowland’s in such an accessible setting on Harvard’s campus, and even more fortunate to be able to hear the words and thoughts of the artist himself to give context to the piece of art on display.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A performance on Nov. 1 and 2 in Boston Ballet’s Black Box Theatre marked the first part of ChoreograpHER Initiative with six women choreographers presenting the works they completed on their peers. The Harvard Crimson got the chance to interview the executive director of the Boston Ballet, Meredith (Max) Hodges ’03,about the inspiration and plans for this women-empowering initiative.
The Harvard Crimson: What does the ChoreograpHER Initiative mean for the upcoming seasons of the Boston Ballet?
Meredith “Max” Hodges: This initiative is made up of three main parts: in the classroom, in the studio, and on our main stage at the Boston Opera House. The first part is that the Boston Ballet School is offering a series of choreographic workshops for young women in our school, so they have an opportunity to create, rehearse, and present choreographic works to their peers. The studio piece is through our series called BB@home, which is a performance series at our home studio and black box theater here at 19 Clarendon St. in Boston’s South End. For the next three years, it will highlight women in choreography. We just had one on Nov. 1 and 2, where we commissioned six new works from six women in our company who created works on their own peers. We will do something like that for the next two years. The third piece is the culminating part of this initiative in the 2020-2021 season. Artistic Director Mikko Nissinen is planning a program entirely dedicated to women artists, so the choreographers will be women but also the music, design, visual arts, and more will feature women talent. With these three pieces together, we hope and believe we will support women’s vision and leadership in this art making.
THC: What was the inspiration behind this initiative?
MH: Women are underrepresented among major ballet choreographers, and this has long been true of big classical ballets, but it’s also true of current new works by ballet companies. We designed this initiative to try to address that. There isn’t a precise moment when the initiative came about, but there has been increasing discussion and awareness in the ballet world of this underrepresentation of women. We talk here at the Boston Ballet about intentionality, and what we want to intentionally do. What we want to intentionally see over the next years with this initiative is that this is an investment worth making because we see something we want to make better. There are a lot of women dancers, and most choreographers are themselves former dancers. We see that pattern in a lot of different fields, certainly not just in the arts. If you look at the corporate world, you see lots of women in an organization but then fewer women at the top. It’s not unique to the ballet world, but nevertheless, it’s there, and our hope is to begin to change that.
THC: What message do you hope this initiative spreads?
MH: For the choreographers, I certainly hope this inspires more women to step forward and try choreography. I hope for those who do try it, some of them feel inspired and have the confidence to continue in it. I hope it builds the ranks of women choreographing for major ballet companies and throughout the ballet world.
THC: And how were the choreographers chosen for this initiative?
MH: Mikko did ask the dancers who would be interested, so he asked them to self-identify. I think it’s also important to note that out of the six women who choreographed, for three of them, it was their first time choreographing.
THC: Were the choreographers given free reign of their choreography?
MH: They really found the inspiration on their own. You saw that in the diversity of the pieces in the program. Some of the works were on pointe, some in ballet flats, some were to pre-existing recorded music. One of the works was to a new composition. Artist Sage Humphries’ work was to live piano performance. Her brother was the composer, and he performed while the dancers danced. You saw a wide breadth of movement language and vocabulary, so you could really see through the six works of art that they were each following their own inspiration.
THC: Has the Boston Ballet ever featured choreographic works from their dancers?
MH: By and large, the majority of the works we perform on the main stage are by existing professional choreographers of global renown, like George Balanchine, Sir Frederick Ashton, William Forsythe, and Justin Peck. We have had previous programs to encourage our dancers to choreograph, typically through the BB@home program. Some of our dancers will get to choreograph for an evening in our studio. It’s at a different scale because the black box has about 150 seats, and the Opera House has about 2,500. It’s okay to take more artistic risks here in the black box: It’s a really great place to support emerging artists. In this blackbox, we have presented works from our dancers in the past, and they have the chance to develop their talents. Then, we have presented those works on the main stage. However, ChoreograpHER is the first time we’ve explicitly dedicated an initiative to promoting women’s voices in choreography.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Common Threads: Weaving Stories Across Time,” which runs through Jan. 13 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, features a diverse collection of textile-inspired artworks of different mediums, created by contemporary artists from around the world. The exhibit strives to “explore the ways in which the art of the past continues to inspire artists now” and executes this goal perfectly. Each piece is distinctive from the others, and ties together both old and new elements of textile art in a novel way.
The exhibit is split into two components: the Cyrus Tapestries, a set of five 16th century tapestries depicting the rise and fall of Cyrus the Great, and the collection of various contemporary pieces in the Hostetter Gallery on the second floor. Though the museum has been in possession of the Cyrus Tapestries for awhile, composer David Lang’s new opera “true pearl: an opera in five tapestries” puts a contemporary twist on the exhibit. The minimalist-style opera features five tracks corresponding to the five main tapestries in the collection, which visitors listen to through provided headsets as they view each tapestry at their own pace. Strange, repetitive lyrics sung by a chorus of voices describe the scene depicted on the corresponding tapestry. For the tapestry in which a secret messenger from Harpagos, the king’s general, delivers a note concealed inside the body of a dead rabbit to Cyrus, the voices sing “We’ll never forget this rabbit. Hare of the steppes / The papers in its gut, concealed.” The opera offers an unusual but refreshingly inventive complement to the exhibit, allowing the visitor to experience art across time periods and mediums through visual and auditory stimulation. The ambient and experimental feel of the music enable the visitor to view the historical tapestries from a new perspective, effectively fitting the theme of connecting “stories across time.”
The other part of the exhibit features a variety of works which integrate different materials, methods, and mediums. Pieces in this collection are created by artists from around the world. “The Great Bare Mat” by the Raqs Media Collective is a carpet inspired by a pun, which comes from two Chinese Han Dynasty bronze mat-weights shaped like bears. One remarkable feature of this carpet, tying together the past and the present, is the seemingly random pattern of white lines spanning across the carpet — the pattern was actually generated by a computer algorithm belonging to members of the Raqs Media Collective. Examples of other works in the exhibit include Lee Mingwei’s “The Mending Project,” a dynamic and interactive piece which invites visitors to bring a broken item to be repaired by a volunteer, intended to spark conversation and “small moments of connection and repair,” according to a description at the exhibit, and Nevet Yitzhak’s “Warcraft,” a digital animated projection of Afghan prayer rugs depicting the mechanical destruction of war, complete with explosive sound effects. Although every work in the room is unique and vastly distinct from any other piece, they are all connected by the same theme of integrating the old and the new to tell powerful stories of the human experience across time.
Even for non-contemporary art enthusiasts, this exhibit is a must-see. Though the exhibit itself is not large, it leaves a powerful impression on the viewer that will last well beyond the walls of the museum. “Common Threads: Weaving Stories Across Time” truly lives up to its name, beautifully demonstrating how art can break barriers and connect people across time and across cultures.

NEW YORK — For some, turkey, football, and family were not the only things to look forward to during Thanksgiving break. On Saturday night, the Harvard men’s hockey team dueled its most intense rival, No. 15 Cornell, in the historic setting of Madison Square Garden.
The Crimson (3-3-2, 1-2-2 ECAC) ousted the Big Red (5-4-0, 3-1-0) on the backs of its young, speedy forwards and sturdy goaltending from senior Michael Lackey. Cornell’s defeat marks its first loss at the Garden since 2013, and the Harvard victory reverses losing trends both against Cornell and in tilts at MSG.
“We used our speed to get back to some pucks,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought Michael Lackey did a nice job of getting some stops back there that allowed our [defense] to make one good solid play.”
With six minutes remaining in the bout, Harvard found itself protecting a 2-1 lead. But the Crimson had plans to pad its advantage.
Sophomore forward Henry Bowlby took off from mid-ice and beat a defenseman to a loose puck. Striding into the zone, he broke in alone on sophomore net-minder Matthew Galajda and slipped a backhand shot through his five-hole, providing his squad with a two-goal security blanket.
With a minute left, an empty-net goal from junior defenseman Adam Fox sealed the win.
“Everyone knew how special it was to play at Madison Square Garden,” Lackey said. “During the game, you’re kind of focused on getting the win. But towards the end, once we got the empty-net goal, just taking a step back and looking around and seeing all the [sad] Cornell fans — it was definitely a sight.”
A slow start to the game left Harvard displeased with its play entering the middle frame. The Crimson needed an injection of energy, and it received it from none other than co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage.
Not even four minutes into the second period, freshman forward Casey Dornbach fired a puck toward the net from the left circle. After Galajda was unable to corral the rebound, Zerter-Gossage found the loose puck and ripped it home under the goalie’s pads.
“It’s always tough going down 1-0, especially early on in the game,” Lackey recalled. “We kept grinding, we kept working, and we got the result. Once [Zerter-Gossage’s goal] happened, everybody really bought in and got behind the momentum.”
The powerplay strike, Zerter-Gossage’s sixth of the season, proved to be the offensive spark that Harvard needed. Less than six minutes after the equalizer, Dornbach earned another apple, this time zipping a cross-crease feed to Bowlby, who buried the open-net chance.
The trio of Bowlby (3–1—4), Dornbach (2–10—12), and freshman center Jack Drury (2–7—9) continues to be the most effective line among the Crimson forwards. Bowlby potted a pair of pucks on Saturday night, and Dornbach finished with three assists. Production from a relatively young attacking unit is paramount to Harvard’s team success this season.
Cornell coach Mike Schafer held his own team accountable for the success of the Crimson’s quick, young forwards.
“They got good speed, but any team — if you’re not playing the right way, not being physical, staying above people — every team is going to look fast,” said the bench boss after the game.
Just as in Harvard’s past three MSG appearances, the opposing team opened the scoring on Saturday night. Big Red blue-liner Alec McCrea fired a wrist shot from the left point, and freshman forward Liam Motley redirected the senior’s shot past Lackey. Motley’s first-career tally ushered in roars from the Cornell-leaning crowd, which grew less enthusiastic as the contest progressed.
Otherwise, Lackey (1 GA, .968 SV%) shone between the pipes. In his strongest performance of the young campaign, the senior made multiple big-time saves to keep his Crimson in the game. His confidence permeated the skaters in front of him.
“Lackey gave us a couple saves at some key times,” coach Donato lauded. “When we scored the first goal, it kind of just settled us in a little bit. As the second wore on, our speed started to show up a little bit.”
On the other end of the ice, Galajda (3 GA, .885 SV%) was more porous, although he had little hope of making the save on both Bowlby tallies. Nevertheless, Lackey thoroughly outdueled his masked counterpart en route to victory. Through nine starts this season, Galajda has failed to attain the impressive numbers he posted in his freshman campaign (20-5-2, 1.51 GAA, .939 SV%).
The two teams will not have to wait long to overwrite the latest chapter in their rivalry. Next Saturday, Cornell will trip to Cambridge for a rematch with its MSG conqueror. This time, however, the game will have conference implications. Fans can also expect the Big Red to reestablish its effective forecheck and usual competitiveness.
Until then, Harvard will enjoy its first victory over Cornell since the 2016-2017 season and will leave New York feeling more confident about its play.
“We dug ourselves into a little bit of a hole with our start,” coach Donato said. “But I think tonight was a great step in the right direction.”

Last Monday evening, the back room of Brattle Street’s Beat Brew Hall transformed into the second Boston Media, Arts & Ideas Mixer. Over drinks, popcorn, and pretzels, the event brought together creative individuals from the Boston area — across all academic and professional disciplines — in a vibrant, friendly, and inclusive environment. It fostered conversations about past accomplishments, current projects, and future ideas, and served to introduce creators (in many forms) to potential future collaborators. This Roving Reporter spoke to some of the mixer’s attendees to learn more about them and about Boston’s creative scene.
James C. Hamet, Boston-area resident and professional
RR: What brings you here tonight?
JH: I have a background in science — I have academic training as an electrical engineer and I now work in neuroscience. To me, science is art. But I see all these people, coming from visual arts, performing arts, music. That type of energy is what I want to see in science. I think that if you’re a scientist, that doesn’t mean you only do science. I think you can do lots of things. By integrating myself in this community and encouraging others to do [so], we can benefit from getting the energy that this community has, and give our own energy back.
RR: What do you think of the intersectionality between arts and science?
JH: I think that you can’t really have science without art, just as you can’t have art without science. We’re constantly seeing how technology is being used in art, but it’s not just that artists now have new tools. Having the energy and vision of an artist changes how you do science. It gives it direction.
Emma K. M. Watson and Mayu Asukai, students
RR: What kind of creative work do you do?
EW: I’m a senior at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, studying film and video. I’ve done narrative, documentary, experimental [films]...and I’ve been gravitating towards video installation. One project I’ve done is called “Head, Hands and Feet,” using three 10 inch cathode-ray televisions with footage from infomercials as a reflection on advertisement culture over the years.
MA: I’m [a student] at Suffolk University, studying film and media production. I don’t have a lot of experience but I’m learning editing and everything related to production. I’m also volunteering with the MPC (Massachusetts Production Coalition) and with IFF (Independent Film Festival) Boston.
RR: How has your experience with Boston’s creative scene been so far?
EW: I think it’s been overall positive. It’s not like L.A. or New York, but I feel a sense of upward momentum. The MPC used to have one Hollywood production per year. Now, they have eight. There’s this big surge of creativity here, where people want to connect with each other and get out of their bubbles, created over the years for various reasons.
MA: When I first came here, I went to school, went home, and that was it. But now, I’ve been trying to step out of my comfort zone with my friends, and since, I’ve been learning a lot from events and from people. It’s been great, generally!
Allison T. Tanenhaus ’05, artist and professional
RR: What creative work do you do?
AT: I’m a writer by profession and experience. After college I worked for an independent film company in Waltham and an online video startup, but then I returned to writing through marketing and communications. I had to leave writing to want to come back to it. What has recently sparked my interest, however, is my digital art. I had a lot of friends who were graphic designers. Seeing that, I could parlay my love of words into art by learning typography. I’ve put business cards around town, as a street artist, and in the process of photographing that, I’ve gotten into image manipulation.
RR: Have you been attending events like these often? How is Boston like for this scene?
AT: A little bit. There’s this event called Network After Work which does speed-networking — you meet a lot of people. I’m from New York originally, and I feel like it’s less saturated here. There’s a nice balance — I don’t feel like I have to choose between 20 things to do every night. I’m also able to go to events and see people I’ve met before. I’m able to foster connections and to know the community, as opposed to feeling like I’m on the outside or that I’ll never be good enough. The arts scene is very welcoming — there’s something with Boston in that there’s so much science, and academia, and education. There’s also so much “fancy” art, but I’m also seeing indie artists coming together. What’s nice about Boston is that there are so many learning opportunities — it’s pretty energizing. People aren’t snooty or competitive here.
Clifford C. Anderson, host and organizer
RR: What do you do?
CA: I have had two primary careers in my background. I currently compose music for media: film, games — any media, really. I’m very passionate about that. The other part of my background, which I find relevant in a cross-disciplinary way, is enterprise software development. That, in turn, was inspired by my studies at Hampshire College, which was very much interdisciplinary in its approach, and takes as a basic premise that if you’re interested in things, what if you cultivated all of those? What if that makes you distinctive in your fields because of what you can bring from other realms?
RR: How did you come about organizing this event?
CA: There were a couple of things: I was really inspired by what I had seen in other cities around the media, arts and entertainment industries. In L.A. and New York, there’s a lot happening in community-building. In the Boston area there are similar events in individual disciplines — but what I didn’t see was [anything] cross-disciplinary. There were major players in different realms but there was nothing that was bringing together people who might have a natural fit.
RR: Are you planning to continue with these mixer events in the future?

CA: Absolutely. This is our second event; the first two have been experimental, in so much that I wasn’t sure who might turn up. I haven’t promoted it very much. It’s been more like, “What if I posted this in a couple of places, told a few people… What would happen?” After two events, I’m convinced there is definitely an interest in this, and it might be worth promoting on a more rigorous, organized basis. It’s all done out of the spirit of wanting to help people.
