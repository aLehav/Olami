After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since a report published in the spring of 2015 found that the College’s General Education program was “failing on a variety of fronts,” the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Gen Ed administrators have been working to revamp this signature set of requirements. Now, after the approval of a new program in March, administrators have a year of data at their fingertips as they look to interpret the effects of the proposed changes, and an opportunity to shape the courses that fulfill the new requirements. While it remains too early to draw any definite conclusions about the exact impact of the overhaul, students, faculty, and administrators can all work to ensure that it comes as close as possible to achieving the lofty goals set out in the mission statement of the program.
We have long been skeptical of the limited overhaul of the Gen Ed program that the faculty eventually implemented, arguing instead for a system of broad distribution requirements. This reservation aside, the data released last week by Stephanie H. Kenen, the administrative director of Gen Ed, suggests that the reduced number of categories in the new program has provided students with greater flexibility. In particular, the enrollment drops in Gen Ed courses that fulfill the Societies of the World and Culture and Belief requirements suggest that current students have taken advantage of requirements completed through previously-taken courses to free up spaces in their schedules for other courses.
We must, however, resist the temptation to overgeneralize. As Kenen points out, this data represents only one semester and “does not make a trend.” It may indicate, however, that the new program is allowing students the freedom to explore areas in which they may not otherwise take classes without imposing as much on their schedules. It also suggests that the changes are curtailing the unnecessary overlaps and redundancies that characterized the previous program. As faculty and administrators work to develop courses for the requirements of the new Gen Ed, we hope they continue to bear these factors in mind.
Beyond data on course enrollments, Kenen’s other comments about the College’s goals for the new Gen Ed are highly encouraging. Her emphasis on increasing transparency for students and on seeking out their input on changes to courses is especially compelling. Recent national events and the campus reactions to them have amply demonstrated that Harvard students are well-versed in applying their studies to the world beyond the classroom, and more student input would help ensure that new courses are tailored to the most salient issues of our time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nine years of Harvard dominance, The Game belongs to Yale once more.
In front of a packed stadium, the Bulldogs (3-7, 3-4 Ivy) shocked Crimson faithful with a late touchdown and a 21-14 win. Freshman quarterback Kurt Rawlings accounted for 205 total yards, freshman receiver Reed Klubnik notched two scores, and the Yale defense weathered two Harvard drives in the final 4:10. 
Besides breaking the nearly decade-long win streak for the Crimson (7-3, 5-2 Ivy), the Bulldogs prevented the hosts from claiming a share of the Ivy League title. Had Harvard triumphed, the team would have completed a four-peat for the first time in school history.
Instead, Penn and Princeton ended in a two-way tie for first thanks to wins over Cornell and Dartmouth, respectively.
“It’s heartbreaking,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “When you realize that you work out 320 days a year for only 10 opportunities, and obviously it all culminates with the Harvard-Yale game, I just feel terrible for our kids.”
Yale’s go-ahead score came late in the fourth quarter, on an 80-yard drive that heated the Bulldogs crowd from tepid enthusiasm to blistering cheers. During the possession, Rawlings went five-for-seven and added 17 rushing yards. 
Nothing was certain until third-and-goal from the three. That’s when the Yale thrower found Klubnik just across the goal line. Bulldogs 21, Crimson 14.
“I was overjoyed, obviously,” Yale captain Darius Manora said. “I was more proud...of these young guys to my left and my right, [Klubnik and Rawlings], and a lot of the young guys who stepped up over the last few games.”
Harvard had two chances to even the score in the waning moments. But with less than four minutes left, a holding call stalled the Crimson at its own 14 and forced a punt.
Later, with 1:13 remaining, Harvard regained the ball at its own 20. The team marched to the Yale 48 but got no further. Three passing plays gained six yards, and on fourth down, junior defensive back Alessi broke up a throw intended for Crimson halfback Anthony Firkser.
 The Bulldogs seized momentum at the start of the second half. With the score locked at 7-7, Yale sophomore Alex Galland jogged on for the kickoff. Instead of booting deep, Galland dinked the ball, raced 10 yards forward, and dove to the turf to recover the surprise onside kick.
“When you get into nine games of film on opponents, there are a lot of tendencies that build up,” Yale coach Tony Reno said. “There was a tendency there. We felt that it was something that was a really good opportunity for us.”
The play jumpstarted the Bulldogs’ offense. On first down from the Harvard 28, Klubnik ran a wheel route to the right pylon. Not even pass interference by senior defensive back Raishaun McGhee could prevent the catch, and Klubnik came down with a score and a 14-7 lead.
The Crimson responded with a lengthy drive—10 plays and 84 yards. The possession seemed in danger on third-and-five from the Harvard 21, but Viviano found Firkser for a 36-yard gain to the Yale 43.
Another key conversion came on a fourth-and-three from the Yale 36 when, with the Bulldogs crowd roaring, Shelton-Mosley outraced his defender for a 34-yard gain. The effort cashed out three plays later when senior tight end Ryan Halvorson tied the score at 14-14 with a third-down score.
After a four-turnover loss against Penn last week, Harvard did not commit one against Yale. Senior quarterback Joe Viviano finished 16-of-28 for 181 yards, and the team’s rushing attack totaled 148 yards on 36 tries.
Still, the Crimson crippled itself with self-inflicted wounds—in this case a missed field goal. With the score tied at 14 early in the fourth quarter, Harvard marched 79 yards into the red zone. However, a holding penalty backed up the offense.
Ultimately freshman kicker Jake McIntyre trotted out and sent a 35-yard attempt wide left, the second misfire of his career.
Meanwhile the Bulldogs benefitted from slick special teams play. Before the onside kick, Yale nailed a trick play on fourth-and-four near the end of the first half. Holder Andrew Johnson took the snap and stepped forward a few yards—only to toss the ball to senior tight end Leo Haenni.
The Tebow-esque completion pushed Yale inside the red zone for the first time all day. With 27 seconds to play in the half, Bulldogs freshman running back Alan Lamar burst forward for a one-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7-7.
That excitement followed a slow first quarter in which neither team drove past the opponent’s 40. The Crimson won the field-position battle, pinning the Bulldogs offense inside the 20 on three consecutive positions.
 However, the Harvard offense failed to advantage of the favorable conditions. Viviano did not complete a pass in the opening period, and at the end of 15 minutes, the score still stood at 0-0.
“[This] reality is something we haven’t experienced in a long time,” Murphy said. “You can put it all out there, you can work as hard as you can, you can believe, and when you do that, you still risk getting your heart broken. That’s certainly what happened today.”

It finally happened. Yale pulled a win out of nowhere today, upsetting a long-standing tradition of Harvard winning. But don’t fret. 2016 might be shaping up to be the worst year in living history, but Flyby has you covered with a few things that’ll help you get through these troubling times:
Just remember that it took them almost 10 years 
Yale’s victory is a long-time coming. We’ve beaten them nine years in a row, and often with some pretty wide margins of victory. Miracles are bound to happen sometimes, right? Let’s just chalk this one up to an aberration in time and look to next year, when we’ll most likely wipe the floor with them... again
The Party’s still going 
The game isn’t even the best part of Harvard-Yale weekend. Everyone knows that most Harvard students couldn’t care less about football. The thrill of the weekend comes from all of the after parties, and the fact that you still have a few more hours left to get wilder than you’ll probably get for the rest of the semester should be helpful in dissipating that post-game sadness.
Go See Harry Potter
A new Harry Potter movie came out this weekend. We haven’t quite had the chance to see it yet because we’ve been busy, you know, enjoying Harvard-Yale, but now that our school has lost, it might be best if we all just head over to Somerville Theater and get lost in the magical world of Harry Potter all over again.
Don’t worry, Harvard. Things will get better!

Today, Harvard and Yale played “The Game” for the 133rd time, but this year, there were some novel additions to the tradition. Flyby has the rundown—and no judgment, really—for anyone who chose to skip out on the game and make money off their free ticket.
Who won?
In a shocking plot twist, Yale… won. That’s right, folks, say goodbye to a nine-year winning streak for the Crimson. But maybe it’s for the best. After all, it’s exciting to switch things up once in awhile.
What’s that on the grass?
Maybe you saw pictures, and wondered what the white specks on the field were. Hats? Flags? Anything that’s supposed to litter a football field during a game? You guessed wrong! Those are paper planes—and even plastic water bottles—that the crowd tossed out. The projectiles, many of which were created from pages of a program handed out at the beginning of the game, came from both sides of the stadium, so the jury’s still out on whether they were supposed to express triumph or frustration.

Well, did the rivalry get nasty?
That… depends on your definition of ‘nasty.’ Some supporters put on a display of stark, bare emotions, and not in the way you’d expect. Several Yale students stripped down to their skin late in the game and took the cheering to the next level. Sounds like someone went a little too hard at the pregame! Take it easy, Yalies. We’ll be the first to admit that you really showed us this year. More than we wanted to see.
