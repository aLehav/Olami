After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black Angels have gotten clean. Their latest release, “Indigo Meadow,” completes the Austin band’s transition—which began on 2010’s “Phosphene Dream”—from the druggy, slow-burning psych-rock of their earlier releases to a tightened, more riff-centric style that oscillates in the sonic space between the Black Keys and the Doors. Funnily enough, “Indigo Meadow” is at its most vibrant and fun during its forays into brazenly unoriginal pastiche, but it sounds stale when the Black Angels try to pull off sophisticated riff-rock.
It used to be an accomplishment to make it through an entire Black Angels album in a single sitting. The band’s 2006 debut “Passover” and 2008 follow-up “Directions to See a Ghost” were characterized by sludgy, reverberating walls of sound that made for an engrossing but exhausting listen. However, “Indigo Meadow” continues the work of its predecessor, “Phosphene Dream,” in stripping away this production in favor of a clear and classic style. Lead singer Alex Maas’s vocals are mostly center-panned and rarely drown under the surrounding instruments, as they often did in the past.
In addition to their evolving production, “Indigo Meadow” also represents a musical shift for the Black Angels. For much of the first half of the album, the band makes an earnest but impotent attempt at stomping, bluesy rock. “Evil Things” and “Don’t Play With Guns” kick off with tight, chromatic riffs from lead guitarist Christian Bland, repeat those riffs through verses, and double down on them in the choruses with headphone-filling overdrive. As characteristically repetitive and well-worn as this style is, making it work demands a convincing aggressiveness and sexual urgency that the Black Angels aren’t up to providing on “Indigo Meadow.” Maas’s vocals are passive rather than swaggering or seductive, and the other members of the band sound as if they’re simply going through the motions. What these songs really need is a dose of chaos—a level of unpredictability to keep them interesting. Instead, they sound canned and sterilized, condemned to fade into the background without putting up a fight.
On “Indigo Meadow,” the Black Angels are best when they set aside any pretense of originality or modernity and dive headfirst into ‘60s nostalgia. This is mostly because they’re superb at evoking the sounds of the bands they imitate. “I Hear Colors (Chromaesthesia)” is an outstanding mix of Jefferson Airplane and the Who. Maas eerily matches Grace Slick’s unique vocal stresses and phrasing while singing some lyrics that wouldn’t sound out of place on “Tommy”: “I hear colors running thru my mind / I can feel them dripping in my eyes.” Elsewhere, “Broken Soldier” and “Always Maybe” work off short, descending melodic phrases and organ riffs pulled straight from the Doors. Both songs also show a significant surf rock influence, kicking off with guitar lines laden with the kind of wet string reverb for which Dick Dale was famous. However, it never feels as if the Black Angels are merely covering or copying these bands—their astonishing skill for imitation makes their appropriations always feel sophisticated and well-formed, rather than forced and stale.
In 1850, Herman Melville claimed that “it is better to fail in originality, than to succeed in imitation.” On “Indigo Meadow,” the Black Angels may have proven him wrong. The band’s most derivative songs are the most enjoyable, possibly because its identity in its more original ones feels so lacking. Even if “Indigo Meadow” is a little uneven in that respect, the album has some great highlights, and the parts that aren’t so great are listenable, if not compelling. And hey—if you don’t like it, you can always buy a copy for your dad. He’ll love it.

"Counting Stars"
OneRepublic, "Native" 
“Counting Stars,” the first track off OneRepublic’s newest album, is one of the band’s best works. Although it starts off with a slow acoustic guitar line characteristic of the band’s earlier pieces, the song progressively escalates into a rabid techno mix that is reminiscent of Swedish House Mafia. With such a wonderfully orchestrated, bold shift, OneRepublic remains true to its roots while paying tribute to the rising popularity of electronic music. Ryan Tedder’s raspy voice is well suited to the new genre-bending music that accompanies it. The times, they are a-changin’, and OneRepublic is game to grow along with them.

"The Phoenix"
Fall Out Boy, "Save Rock and Roll"
Fall Out Boy is back with their newest war cry. Close on the heels of their first single “My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up),” “The Phoenix” is an uptempo, threatening track complete with loud, pounding drums and Patrick Stump’s resolute voice, which serves to further introduce  the band’s upcoming album, “Save Rock and Roll.” The chorus dissolves into a powerful, catchy tune, and the band’s characteristic guitar riffs have been replaced with electronic music that more appropriately complements Fall Out Boy’s exuberant energy. The band also successfully experiments with unique sound effects, including the noise of flickering lights, and subtle falsetto shifts on the title word “phoenix.” Reenergized and evolved, Fall Out Boy is back and ready to start a new “fiyah.”
"Cold Dead Hand"
Jim Carrey
“With your cold dead aim you’re trying to prove your junk is bigger,” Carrey sings in his cleverly composed satire “Cold Dead Hand.” Using music as a medium to offer his own two cents on the charged issue of firearm control, Carrey does not hesitate to take a shot at gun control opponents. While the song itself lacks significant aesthetic appeal, it is clear that musical innovation is not Carrey’s immediate intent. Instead, Carrey’s motive for “Cold Dead Hand” seems to be to incite public outcry and reflection. By mocking the likes of Charlton Heston, former president of the NRA, and gun-lovers with references to “little bitty glands,” Carrey succeeds on this end. With such charming lyrics and impressive Western riffs, Carrey has fashioned an entertaining, humorous song. And given the ongoing debate on gun control, Carrey’s deep, theatrical voice will be remain relevant for months to come—politically if not musically.

The city of Schenectady, New York tells a tale of inheritance, or inheritance lost. Once the home to the General Electric Company, Schenectady, or in its translation from Mohawk, “the place beyond the pine plains,” is now a sleepy residential area whose peak of growth ended over a century ago. For director Derek Cianfrance of “Blue Valentine” fame, this made it the perfect location for his new feature film, “The Place Beyond The Pines.”
“It was a good place to talk about American legacy and how it doesn’t go away,” Cianfrance said in a press conference in New York City on March 10.
Spanning generations but remaining rooted in the eastern New York city, “Pines,” starring Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendes, and Ray Liotta, explores the sins handed down from father to son and the lengths to which future generations might go to fulfill or cast off those legacies. Family drama, crime, heist, action, and tragedy—all are incorporated into the three-part film and come together in what Cianfrance called a “Biblical story.”
Counter to what Gosling fans may be expecting, his character, stunt motorcyclist-cum-bank robber Luke Glanton, is only one of a number of pivotal players in the three-part tale, and he remains absent for a large part of the film. Glanton, as the plot’s catalyst, becomes a clear character foil for Cooper’s ambitious rookie cop Avery Cross, who is navigating a corrupt police department and fighting to come to terms with the choices he is forced to make in his job. Both men struggle with the women in their lives as well as with their infant sons. After their paths cross suddenly and violently, both families are altered forever, and the transition to the third part of the film—focused on the now-adolescent sons of Glanton and Cross—is made.
Despite all these heavily dramatic elements, the film is still meant to be realistic, which is why the actors and director truly tried to create an immersive reality for themselves by doing their best to actually become the characters they play in the movie. Cianfrance as well as the cast members cited the welcoming nature of Schenectady as a significant contributor to their ability to craft a believable, visceral reality for “Pines.”
“We wouldn’t have been able to make this movie anywhere else,” Cianfrance said. The city of Schenectady worked with the cast and crew—its police officers allowed actors to ride along with them, police stations and active high schools became set locations, and Gosling, playing Glanton, stormed into actual city banks.
The film’s tripartite structure brought a wide variety of genres into “Pines,” and that allowed Cianfrance to explore the tropes of those forms in a new light. “You have all the conventions of different sorts of movies,” Gosling said at the conference. “But [Cianfrance] has deconstructed them in a way that makes people experience [those conventions] in a different way.”
Cianfrance partially credited his ability to work with multiple genres at once to his own experience with other movies. “Everything I’ve ever seen, even movies I’ve hated, affect how I make movies,” he said. Meanwhile, his history with documentaries fostered his signature realistic style of filmmaking: members of the cast utilized different strategies in order to match that style. Mendes, who plays a struggling mother in “Pines,” worked in a Schenectady diner on her days off, while Gosling underwent an intense period of motorcycle training. Cianfrance was also notorious amongst his cast members for leaving many character decisions to the respective actors. Mendes was allowed to choose the actress who would play her on-screen mother, while Gosling chose the tattoos that would cover Luke Glanton’s body. Immediately regretting the decision to have a facial tattoo, Gosling found that the authentic sense of shame and embarrassment he felt contributed to his portrayal of the hyper-masculine yet tormented Glanton.
“My interpretation of what Derek does is [that] he creates real, visceral environments, just throws us in there, and sees what happens,” Dane DeHaan, who plays Glanton’s son in his teenage years, said. Cianfrance’s allowance for improvisation placed high amounts of pressure on his actors, but that pressure often yielded the best results. He claimed that he only expects two things from his actors. “I want them to surprise me, and I want them to fail,” Cianfrance said. That vulnerability was crucial to what the cast saw as the authenticity and effectiveness of the film, as well as something that helped bring the cast members together in a truly collaborative effort.
“It became a running joke, you know,” Mendes said, referring to Cianfrance’s on-set invocation of the ‘first pancake’ that never turns out well, but is always followed by superior creations. “He’d always say, ‘Okay, guys. Let’s make our first pancake.’”

Movement and language may initially seem at odds with each other—one immediate, the other permanent; one physical, the other stored in the mind—but “BYO: Voices of the Contemporary at the Carpenter Center” successfully brought the two worlds together Wednesday night. The event demonstrated the overlapping emotions, ideas, and concerns of dancers and poets with “dance-text collaborations.” The event was part of the “Bring Your Own” series at the Carpenter Center, which is designed to foster debate  around issues in contemporary culture.
BYO invites emerging figures in contemporary art to campus to perform, speak, and engage in conversations with their audience. All organizers  ask is that, in the spirit of ecological sustainability, audience members bring their own dishware for the light dinner they provide.Julie Carr, one of the speakers, teaches English at the University of Colorado, Boulder  and is co-publisher of Counterpath Press, the author of four books of poetry, and a former professional dancer with 10  years of performing experience. She presented and commented on videos of key dance-text collaborations from the early 1980s to the present. The performances included “Come Home Charley Patton,” a work by poet and dancer Ralph Lemon, who is artistic director of the dance company Cross Performance.
This work featured a dancer speaking and struggling to continue his performance as he is hosed with water, combined with a sequence of videos and spoken word recited by a lone speaker. Other works presented included “NOX,” the stark, haunting combination of Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener dancing to Canadian poet Anne Carson’s words, and “PA RT” the iconic 1983 piece with text by composer Robert Ashley and dance by Lisa Nelson and Steve Paxton. According to Carr, “PA RT” was the piece that truly made her realize she wanted to be a dancer and led her to study with  K.J. Holmes, who became her longtime collaborator. She is now Artist in Residence at Movement Research NYC and an independent dance artist based in New York.The event culminated with a live performance of a collaboration in progress, with text by Carr and dance performance by Holmes, followed by a discussion of their creative process moderated by Carrie Lambert-Beatty, Professor of VES and History of Art and Architecture.
Titled “HIC SVNT DRACONES,” a reference to the inscriptions cartographers once used to label unexplored territory, the piece is about the inadequacy of representation.  “All poetry is really about the failure of poetry. You try, and you fail, but you keep trying. That is the pathos and eros of poetry,” Carr said. Holmes said she feels the piece also expresses themes of madness, obsession, and repetition.It began with Holmes kneeling, repeatedly holding sheets of tracing paper to her face and tracing her features until she created a stack of drawings that she then hung around the room, a sequence she said was inspired by her experience teaching a class where she had her students do creative tracings.
Carr’s recorded text, which described a cafe and included repetitions of the numbers 1-20,  then came into play as a frame for Holmes’ improvised dance. Carr said she was careful to keep the text from becoming too autobiographical, going through and changing pronouns, using other people’s voices for her recordings, and layering different speakers and words.The piece was continually changing and evolving, keeping some elements from previous performances while changing others. According to Holmes, the dance was influenced but not strictly governed by the text. “We were trying not to be too literal as we got to know the words,” she said.
Carr and Holmes both agreed that their collaborative art is a form of storytelling, a way of questioning and remaking identity. The event suggested that the interaction between poetry and dance can create new art form with a more powerful effect than either might have produced alone.

After an abrupt 9-month delay in order to convert the film to 3D (and, rumor has it, add more Channing Tatum), “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” is finally upon us. Would it surprise you to learn that “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” is complete nonsense? It shouldn’t. It really shouldn’t be surprising that a movie based on a television series meant to sell action figures has a half-baked plot and two-dimensional characters and masks them with misdirection in the form of a lot of explosions. Yet there are small kernels of a good movie in “G.I. Joe: Retaliation,” the first in the annual slew of fun but inconsequential summer action flicks.
The sequel picks up where the first left off, with Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) posing as the President of the United States following something known as the Nanomite Wars. It’s all gibberish as excuse for cartoonish action, but it’s not like you’re going to see a movie starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson for its nuanced take on global geopolitics.The G.I. Joes are framed by Zartan, and a strike on the team eliminates all but Roadblock (The Rock), Flint (D.J. Cotrona), and Lady Jaye (Adrianne Palicki). The survivors set out to find the reason why their government has betrayed them. Along the way, they recruit the help of mute ninja Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and retired General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who is the reason they call themselves “Joes.”
The main problem with the film is that it seems unable to decide whether to be serious or cartoonish, and various actors fall on either side of the fence. The villains get to have more fun, it seems. Jonathan Pryce as Zartan impersonating the President delivers the line “I’m the quicker blower upper, baby!” with a particularly endearing B-movie zeal. Ray Stevenson as Firefly, whose weapon is actually robotic exploding fireflies, breaks into a prison with a motorcycle that literally splits apart into multiple live rockets. The doomsday device constructed by Cobra Commander is a satellite that drops a gigantic metal spike from orbit to trigger catastrophic seismic activity. It’s stupid and impractical and so, so stupid and kind of really great.
Elsewhere, a scene in which the retired Colton opens up every cabinet in his house to reveal a gun collection more extensive than that of any doomsday prepper strikes the ideal winking and exaggerated tone for the film—the four-digit combination on his gun locker is 1776. But the rest of the Joes don’t get to have nearly as much fun as their adversaries. Palicki has the unfortunate task of delivering a monologue about how Lady Jaye’s father did not respect women in the military while Flint (and by extension, the audience) voyeuristically watches her undress. She also has to say the line “We can mask our IP address. I’ll cyberblast an encoded beacon every six hours,” as if that means anything. In almost every scene, The Rock is one overzealous flex away from ripping out of his clothes.
Until the its climax, “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” feels like two separate films. Roadblock and crew’s recovery stateside has all the trappings of a generic, slightly jingoistic ‘80s action film, while a separate narrative shows Snake Eyes and his villainous counterpart Storm Shadow in a vague Asian setting referred to only as “the mountains.” Whereas the Roadblock arc is about bullets and explosions, the Snake Eyes storyline is more evocative of old martial arts B-movies, complete with a faux-philosophical, half-blind sensei played by RZA. It also provides the film’s most exciting action sequence, a ninja sword fight in which all involved swing along the side of a mountain.
Perhaps the greatest indication of the missed potential of “G.I. Joe: Retaliation” comes in two scenes at the beginning, in which The Rock and Channing Tatum’s Duke shoot the breeze in exchanges that feel largely improvised. Unfortunately, Tatum’s appearance amounts to an extended cameo, and for the rest of the film, The Rock has nobody to bounce dialogue off of. There is a distinct lack of chemistry between The Rock and the other actors, accented all the more by those couple of opening scenes that hint at what could have been.
If you have some time to kill, you could do worse than “G.I. Joe: Retaliation.” In between some competent action and a lot of techno-military nonsense, there is a ghost of a better movie here. Maybe the filmmakers know this. But knowing is only half the battle.

New York has a surprisingly complicated relationship with soul music. Strangely enough for a city that has consistently been at the forefront of all aspects of African-American culture—from the Harlem Renaissance through jazz and the birth of hip-hop to the present day—it never produced a home-grown soul scene. For a brief period in the ’60s it passed its cultural mantle to several cities that frankly seem like backwaters when compared to the Big Apple: places like Detroit, Philadelphia, Memphis, and Muscle Shoals. In fact, I would argue that the city played an active role in killing off soul music, as disco—a movement that exploded out of downtown Manhattan in the mid ’70s—replaced soul and funk as the main form of dance music. However, hip-hop, the other great New York cultural invention of the ’70s, has done more to preserve and popularize soul than anything else.
In the early ’70s Leroy Burgess had a big problem. His Harlem-based soul band Black Ivory was struggling to stay above water in a town without a big soul market and on a label that didn’t have the resources to promote its music beyond the East Coast. Even worse, as the years trundled along disco got bigger, DJs stopped spinning soul, and the clubs stopped hiring soul bands. Eventually, Burgess would jump ship and make a name for himself as a producer—working for artists like Rick James—and Black Ivory would slowly fall apart.
What they left behind was a body of work perfect for sampling in hip-hop. In fact, Black Ivory—largely due to the fact that their music is featured in songs by artists as wide-ranging as Lil B and Brand Nubian—reunited and released an album called “Continuum” in 2011. This story is not unique to this band. Artists as well respected as Kool and the Gang and James Brown all were introduced to a new generation by hip-hop producers. What these MCs and DJs discovered was that the sound of ’70s soul and funk was a perfect foundation on which to build their records. They would sample the catchiest part of the song and use these segments to construct beats for some of hip-hop’s classic tracks.
I only discovered Black Ivory recently, and that was when I found out the tearworm that makes the song “Criminology,” by Raekwon, so nasty is actually from the intro to “I Keep Asking You Questions,” a little-known track buried towards the back of Black Ivory’s debut album. The song starts with a lock-step descending horn line backed by strings before getting into a guitar-based shuffle. Burgess sings “I keep asking you questions,” only to answer in an impossibly high falsetto, “you keeping telling lies.” Almost as a response to his frustration, the band rips into one monster of a groove, with the guitar hammering out chords over a driving drum beat. On top of all this, the horns blast out an infectious five-note line in a sort of repetitive motion, giving “I Keep Asking You Questions” a classic funk feel. It sounds like a Jackson 5 song might, if the girl Michael sings for in “I Want You Back” led him along for years before leaving.
Black Ivory should have been New York’s answer to Sly and the Family Stone—they certainly were good enough—but due to a combination of poor timing and the limits of a small label they never got the audience they deserved. However, great music is timeless, and even though they weren’t appreciated in their day, Black Ivory found a new audience in a bunch of hip-hop producers with an ear for a great groove. Thank god for those producers, because if it weren’t for them, soul freaks who weren’t around to experience the music firsthand—such as myself—would never have been able to explore the artists that the industry left behind.

I’m going to go on a rant and say a lot of things that I might not totally mean if I thought about it harder. But I feel like I need to say it, especially before I leave Harvard. And maybe I’m biased, but I’ve worked in other countries, so here it is: Americans don’t know how to take a break. And when they do, they’re still on the clock, plugged into emails so nobody misses anything or gets fired (or whatever). People are so scared to take days off that they end up retiring with a year of paid leave. I’ve heard it’s something about Weber and some Protestant Ethic or Spirit of Capitalism (or something). At least Europeans know how to take a proper holiday and even sick days when they’re, you know…sick. And the Spanish! They get a full rest in the middle of every single day.
“The Puritans turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment,” decries Tim Kreider in his New York Times article on “The ‘Busy’ Trap.” He further laments the fact that so many people today almost indulge in their busyness, claiming that it is often a self-inflicted woe and even, for some, a point of pride. While I generally assumed work was so that we, as humans, could stay alive and perpetuate our species, I understand Kreider’s sentiments. He argues that idleness is not simply a vacation, vice, or indulgence, but that it is necessary to the brain for things like dreaming, creativity, and innovation, for a chance to step back from hectic life to get perspective on said life.
But, that said, the fact that so many people feel the need to be busy all the time is something with which I can relate.
Kreider brings up a more subtle point in his article, and it is this point that I want to get into: “Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.” If you were to take a proper break from everything—all external stimuli, including work, television, and even the internet— and sat alone in your room for an extended period of time, imagine what would happen. Personally, I tend to think about things that have happened recently, not so recently, things that might happen, and then I eventually tend to gravitate toward the existential if left alone long enough. I end up pondering the absurd state and decidedly brief nature of my existence. This used to bother me. I couldn’t explain it and I couldn’t understand it; therefore, I did not like to think about it.
Blaise Pascal, the mathematician and physicist, was also a dabbling philosophe. In “Pensées,” he notes, “Being unable to cure death, wretchedness and ignorance, men have decided, in order to be happy, not to think about such things.”
Idleness can lead to self-reflection, and self-knowledge leads to insight, which, says Pascal, exposes the wretchedness within one’s self—in other words, a revelation of the fact that you don’t really know why you exist, which is man’s curse as the thoughtful animal. “That,” Pascal says, “is why prison is such a fearful punishment.” To be trapped up with one’s mind in a cage and no diversion would be to wallow in one’s own wretchedness, to stare into Nietzsche’s famed abyss.
That is why, Pascal purports, people prefer the hunt to the capture. Once you’ve got the thing you’re after, then what? Rest? What about when the dreaded question of the meaning of your existence and the immanence of your death seeps into your consciousness? Then, rest would become much less restful and much more full of angst. In response to the leisure-loving sentiments put forth by Kreider, Pascal (and I) would argue, “[people] think they genuinely want rest when all they really want is activity…they would do anything to be disturbed.”
Sometimes, though, being “disturbed” simply isn’t enough. One needs excitement along with entertainment. Some reward or prize is necessary to fully capture one’s attention from the pervasive ennui of existential dread. Gambling with no money, running without chasing something—these are not enough to fully divert the thoughtful. For a true diversion, Pascal argues, “He must create some target for his passions and then arouse his desire, anger, fear, for this object he has created.” Although Kreider would argue that this is giving into what he calls the “‘busy’ trap,” I see no problem with this—if you realize what you’re doing.
Like Kreider, I think people should be aware of the “‘busy’ trap,” and I advocate the necessity of idleness, but I am also defending being unnecessarily busy if it makes you feel good and if you know the reasons you try to stay busy. Once you reckon with your unobstructed mind, if you then prefer diversion to your thoughts, mindfully choosing to make yourself busy can be a wonderful process that has unlimited potential for making peace with the absurdity of your existence.

Imagine it’s the morning of your birthday, or the afternoon you’re headed to the airport, or the evening when your new relationship status (#taken) was unveiled. You turn to your cell phone to share this news with your Twitter fam and discover that the top trending topics in the Twitterverse are actually already about you. Sound exciting? Frightening? Bizarre? Welcome to the social media world of K-pop.
The K-pop phenomenon has been in the works for quite some time, and it is impossible to dismiss either the expansive business strategies created to elevate the popularity of artists or the creative genius behind the craft of composing addictive tunes. However, it’s hard to imagine that the genre’s universal domination would have fully come to fruition without the parallel rise of social media.
While K-pop has maintained popular appeal throughout East Asia for nearly two decades, before the proliferation of global social networks, attempts by K-pop stars to break into Western markets essentially failed. In 2008, K-pop queen BoA attempted a foray into the US market. After disappointing results and failing to break into the mainstream pop culture, she ultimately returned to Japan and South Korea, where she still reigns at the top of the K-pop world as an active solo singer and a judge on popular televised audition program “KPopStar.” In 2009, the girl group Wonder Girls, pushed the boundaries of K-pop further by opening the Jonas Brothers’ tour throughout the US. However, they still remained relatively unknown throughout the States, and they too returned to South Korea, where they proved far more lucrative and popular.
Now, consider the development of social networking platforms. In 2006, Facebook finally opened its doors to the whole public. The same year saw the birth of Twitter, followed by Tumblr (2007), Instagram (2010), and Google+ (2011). The waves of social media through the past decade illustrate a level of globalization in which people on opposite ends of the world are able to connect through more and more readily accessible mediums. Likewise, these social networking platforms make it easier for K-pop artists to reach larger, more global audiences.
For instance, in 2011, Rolling Stone magazine mentioned hip-hop girl group 2NE1 as a group worth checking out in a News Round Up, and then in 2012, the magazine even published an in-depth list, “The Top 10 K-Pop Groups Most Likely to Break in America.” This is a far cry from the cold reception that K-pop artists previously received in the United States. Moreover, K-pop now has its own channel on YouTube; the video platform corporation even celebrated its seventh anniversary à la K-pop style with “MBC Korean Music Wave in Google,” a free collaborative concert between Korean broadcast corporation MBC and Google that gave away all 22,000 tickets within 30 minutes and attracted over one hundred thousand viewers in its livestream.
The K-pop culture seems to have recognized the massive role that social network platforms play in its ability to sell. Artists and corporations have fully embraced the benefits of social media. Silly snippets of conversations between artists on Twitter excite fans for allowing them a glimpse into the seemingly private lives of their idols, and fans take to the same social media platforms to express their dedication in return—hashtags of their own invention become top trending topics overnight to recognize the birthday, comeback, or album release of their favorite stars on Twitter.
Artists have even begun to take to Instagram to post quirky photos that receive thousands of “likes” from fans; the corporations that manage these artists use the same platform to upload teaser images leading to an artist’s comeback, as witnessed by YG Entertainment’s timed release of teaser stills of their “monster rookie” Lee Hi on the eve of the release of her first full album. Groups such as 2PM also utilize Google+ to host live-streamed hangouts with fans worldwide. Most recently, hip-hop rapper, fashionista, and the leader of Big Bang, G-Dragon, has announced that his latest track will be unveiled on April 1 through a free calling and chatting application, Naver LINE, and only fans following him on the platform will be able to download the track.
On the flipside, these same applications and platforms often lead to less than positive experiences for K-pop artists as well. For instance, Choi Siwon, member of Super Junior, revealed his Twitter was hacked last January: “Someone hacked my account…I know who did [it], but I’m not gonna tell. JUST DON’T DO THAT ANYMORE. Please.” Moreover, due to the public nature of social networking platforms, rumors of painful breakups and scandals spread like wildfire. For instance, over-attentive fans realized that lead rapper Yong Jun-hyung of BEAST and lead dancer Goo Ha-ra of girl group KARA “unfollowed” each other on Twitter, leading to a sweeping scandal before the breakup was officially announced by their respective agencies a week afterward. As such, perhaps it’s not too surprising that some artists choose to close their Twitter accounts altogether… only to be received with more enthusiasm when they return, like actor Jang Geun Seuk.
Despite the potential breaches of privacy that social media platforms may present, it’s worth wondering whether K-pop would have achieved the worldwide popularity it has today without the rise of social media outlets. However, the warm embrace of popular social networking platforms that aren’t necessarily as common in mainstream Korean pop culture as in the United States—for instance, pre-Twitter and Instagram, most people utilized Korean social networking platforms such as Cyworld or me2day, and still do—shows an attuned attentiveness to the outside world and global audience. The propelling forces and central figures of the K-pop realm have accepted social media’s proliferation and are unafraid of riding on its waves to better present and publicize the K-pop phenomenon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although several months still remain until Veterans Day, some are currently commemorating the service and sacrifices of America’s troops. Boston choir Coro Allegro accomplishes just that with its concert “…In Time of War,” which will take place at Sanders Theatre this Sunday.
Founded in 1990, Coro Allegro is a nonprofit Boston chorus for members of the LGBT community and allies that specializes in classical music. Yoshi Campbell, a member of the Board of Directors, praises the strong sense of community and acceptance fostered by members of the chorus. “It’s a culmination of performing.... Together, we are all allies,” she says.
After its recent release of two CDs—“Awakenings” and “In Paradisum”—Coro Allegro will celebrate artistic director David Hodgkins’s 20th anniversary season with “…In Time of War.” International organization Veterans for Peace serves as a community partner for the concert.
Hodgkins developed this concert after being inspired by composer Lee Hoiby’s setting of U.S. Private Jesse Givens’s final letter home from Iraq. Each of the pieces that Coro Allegro will perform revolves around this theme of war and the armed forces. “[The concert] seems a very tangible, public acknowledgement in honor of their service,” Hodgkins says.
Coro Allegro will open with “The Lamentations of Jeremiah,” written by Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera after World War II. It will be followed by Hoiby’s “Last Letter Home,” an emotionally powerful piece that serves as the concert’s thematic centerpiece. Practices of this piece have proved emotional, with singers being moved to tears. “It’s a call to those to see the suffering caused by war,” Campbell says. This contrasts with composer Peter Eldridge’s “Come Home,” a jazz piece initially written for Grammy-winning a capella group New York Voices. The chorus rounds out its performance with Randall Thompson’s “Alleluia” and Joseph Haydn’s “Mass in Time of War.” Soloists for the concert will include soprano Teresa Wakim, mezzo-soprano Pamela Dellal, bass Thomas Jones, and tenor Stefan Reed.
Above all, “…In Time of War” is intended to be a powerfully emotional performance, Campbell says. “[The concert] is a way to honor the suffering of all in war and the bravery of those who served, but also to be reminded in a really intentional way of our shared humanity,” she says.

For better or for worse, Jason Alexander has become tied to the crabby, inept man he portrayed on “Seinfeld” for nine years. Alexander perfected all of George Costanza’s tics and tendencies, creating a legendary character that was both easy to identify with and repulsive. So it was slightly disarming to see Alexander so charming and poised when he came to Harvard on Thursday. In an eventful day, Alexander answered questions in a Cabot House talk with former Nieman fellow Alicia Anstead in the afternoon and performed with the Immediate Gratification Players in an evening ceremony. In these two events, Alexander showed the humor for which he is so famous, but also made it clear that he is a renaissance man who can also sing and dance.
 Alexander dove into his early history during his conversation with Anstead. His first love was magic, but he was lured to the theater at 13 when a very pretty girl came up to him and asked him if he sang: “I do now!” He scored a role as a Von Trapp child in the local production of “The Sound of Music,” and within a year, he was working professionally. “Theater is instant community,” he said. “Everybody is accepted and loved.”
 Alexander landed his gig on “Seinfeld” through what he termed a set of happy accidents. He said he auditioned for the role by impersonating Woody Allen and proceeded to give a first-rate impression of the comedian at the event in Cabot.  He said he initially struggled with playing the idiosyncratic George, but upon discovering that the character was based largely on the show’s producer and co-creator Larry David himself, he saw the character as more human. “It opened the whole psychology of the character,” Alexander said.
 “Seinfeld” soon became one of the most popular shows on television in the late 1990s. Alexander reminisced about his favorite episodes, which included “The Chinese Restaurant” and the controversial “The Contest.” “Nothing about that episode should have been allowed to happen,” Alexander said, but then declared that the episode was a turning point and fueled the show’s major success.
 Since the show’s end in 1998, Alexander has dabbled in directing, producing, writing, and poker. Alexander’s prolific theater career  included winning a Tony Award for “Best Featured Actor in a Musical” in 1989 for “Jerome Robbins' Broadway.” The actor also divulged that his dream role would be Sweeney Todd, the murderous, psychopathic singing barber from the musical “Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.” “I know things about that role that no one has done yet,” he said, adding, “Not that I’ve killed somebody,” to the laughter of the audience.
  In the evening, Alexander was honored as the Player of the Year by the Instant Gratification Players, and received a signature honorary yellow-and-red IGP tie . He told a series of stories, and the IGP then improvised their comedy using them as a starting point. Alexander then jumped in on some of the sketches himself. The IGP did particularly well when Alexander detailed a prank gone awry that involved making sexual gestures toward “Seinfeld” co-star Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a front of a crowd of shocked spectators at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. 
 Alexander said he will continue to perform—he is currently touring the country and giving stand-up comedy performances, and he hinted that he will return to Broadway next year.  Though Alexander may be defined by George Costanza, his performances on Thursday show that his talents extend far beyond that iconic role.

The Harvard Ballet Company will celebrate its 20th anniversary at this year’s spring performance, which opens on Friday. Since its founding in 1993, HBC has evolved from a six-member group that was frequently a guest act at campus jazz shows into an independent corps of 25 dancers with its own biannual performances. The name of its new show, “Crescendo,” is meant to commemorate its growth.
The lifeblood of the company has been its steady flow of original professional and student choreography, which will be on full display next weekend. This year, the company has collaborated with not one but two guest choreographers who have devised new pieces expressly for HBC. George Birkadze, a resident choreographer at Festival Ballet Providence, will send dancers drifting and flowing like snowflakes to the minimalist music of Philip Glass. “He is very hot right now in the contemporary ballet world,” says Bridget D. Scanlon ’15, a student director of the show. Her co-director, Michelle Y. Luo ’14, is performing in a piece by the other guest choreographer, Alan Obuzor, whom Dance Magazine included in its 2013 list of “Twenty-Five to Watch.” In stark contrast to Birkadze, Obuzor has set his piece in the heat of the jungle.
“[The choreographers] have really enjoyed working with us because we are such quick learners,” Luo says. “They have described it as a very positive experience.”
In addition to premiering the two professional pieces, the HBC will revive two historic pieces from its recent past: Boyko Dossev’s “Bolero,” first performed in spring 2011, and Ricky Kuperman’s “To Dust,” from fall 2009. From the distant past of ballet, the co-directors have chosen to reenact a scene from “Swan Lake.” “We chose it because it is for us the most quintessentially classical piece of ballet,” Luo says.
Like with all HBC’s shows, audience members can expect performances ranging from the traditional and primitive to the contemporary and hip. As their poster promises, there will be “swans, statues, soldiers and snowflakes” sharing the large stage of Farkas Hall. “Our program mixes up different stories and styles to keep people continuously entertained,” Luo says.
“[We will be] giving ballet to you in every shape, way and form,” Scanlon says.

Time waits for no one in the fashion world, and the executive producers of the Identities Fashion Show, Thomas N. Dai ’14 and Rachel F. Chanen ’15, have experienced this firsthand. Formerly the creative directors of Identities, Dai and Chanen started planning for this year’s show at the beginning of last summer. While the annually sold-out student production has served as a creative outlet for aspiring fashionistas and designers from Harvard, as well as from established businesses, since its inception in 2006, it has also challenged its producers to explore fashion from the business side and to adapt to the constantly changing atmosphere of the industry. In a business where last-minute changes are frequent, the board is still formatting the show as late as a week before it is to premiere this Friday. “I have learned more from being a producer of Identities than I have from being a student at Harvard,” Chanen says.
Although Dai says the theme of the show is always dynamic and develops organically from the interactions between board members, he also emphasizes that Identities will remain first and foremost a student production that promotes creativity in fashion and design. “It’s important to never lose sight of the core of the show. We want to celebrate what is underexposed at Harvard,” Dai says.
This year’s theme is inspired by a panel on entrepreneurship in fashion sponsored by the Harvard Vestis Council, of which Dai is a board member. Carrying on with the entrepreneurial spirit of the show, the board made many changes to the show’s customary setup. Rather than honoring a fashion designer with the Leadership in the Arts award, as they have in past years, the producers decided to partner with Loqall, a fashion startup developed out of Harvard, to host a fashion competition. The winning pieces from the eight finalists will be featured during the show to illuminate the future of fashion in the student world. To give the show an experimental feel, Identities will be held not in Annenberg, its traditional location, but in Northwest Labs. “We want the show to be innovative, to engage with fashion now and in the future,” Dai says.

Music is more than just a source of entertainment for Phillip C. Golub ’16. As well as boasting an impressively large collection of tracks on his iPod, Golub has composed concert pieces that have been performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. On Friday, one of his pieces will be debuted by the Harvard student ensemble the Brattle Street Chamber Players in Paine Hall.
The Harvard Crimson: How long have you been composing?
Phillip C. Golub: I’ve been composing since the beginning of high school. That would be about four years ago.
THC: You obviously know music very well. Do you play any instruments?
PCG: I’m a pianist. I play jazz piano as well as classic piano.
THC: How does it feel to have your work being performed as a freshman in college?
PCG: First of all, there’s the general thing of having your music performed, which is an incredible experience. I always describe [hearing my pieces performed] as [though] time goes in two directions—everything slows down and you hear every moment. It’s like every second takes an hour and you hear every mistake and everything you intended going wrong. But at the same time, the whole piece goes by in a matter of moments and you don’t even notice it… As a freshman though, I’m very excited to already kind of be on the map a little bit…. I was excited coming into Harvard. I knew how much student music was going on on campus, and I’m very excited to already be able to work with people.
THC: What is your level of involvement with the final performance of your music?
PCG: I always feel that once a piece is written, although it has the composer’s name on it, it doesn’t belong to the composer anymore. Some composers take a different approach to this and they like to be very involved in the process, but I write my music for musicians to play and to interpret it. I hope they take the same approach with my music as they would with anybody’s music, like [they would] with a dead composer. I’m there to be a resource… but ultimately I take a pretty hands-off approach. I go to rehearsals, but I try not to say too much unless there’s something that they’re just really not getting. We’ve only had a few rehearsals, and I’ve been there for some of them as a guide…I’ve also been absent at a few rehearsals to just let them do their thing.
THC: Is composing something that drives your career goals?
PCG: Very possibly. I perform and I compose, and I can’t ever see myself giving up one or the other. But it’s not really sustainable to do both. I think they will inform each other in some way if my career in music actually happens.
THC: So you compose classical music, but what types of music do you like to listen to?
PCG: It’s very hard for me to put labels on things like this. I generally like to say I like to listen to any music that I think is good, but that’s not really saying anything. I listen to classical music…. I listen to a lot of jazz, and anything else, whether that’s indie rock or hip-hop or folk or whatever…. Anything that strikes me when I hear it, I’ll spend some time with it and it will probably make its way into what I’m doing in some indirect way.
THC: Who would you say has been your greatest inspiration as a composer?
PCG: My dad would be the first. My dad is a composer, so there’s obviously a very direct influence there. Some other composers I really admire for very different reasons are Stravinsky, who was kind of my first real obsession. I saw the Los Angeles Philharmonic perform “The Rite of Spring” when I was eight years old with Zubin Mehta conducting. It’s my first musical memory. I met him after the concert, and it was this incredible star-struck experience…. I also had an obsession with the “Goldberg Variations” by Bach when I was little. I also love Ravel. He is currently my favorite composer. I find what he is doing [to be] so amazing. And then Beethoven, because he changed everything.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Harvard Square’s Black Ink is a store that can turn 20 feet into half an hour. What looks like a wall of shelves can turn into an afternoon of shopping, since it takes an unexpectedly long time to explore this compact space. Stepping in feels less like entering a store than a modern-day cabinet of curiosities. Glass bowls brim with tops, elastics, and oversized paper clips. Cubic shelves vault 11 feet to the ceiling and are replete with colorful tea sets, posters, and matchbook gardens.
 
It’s not just the quirky and beautiful products that attract people, but the store’s design. The towering shelves order the chaos and feel limitless. It’s an experience more akin to entering a museum than shopping, and Black Ink isn’t alone. The arrangement and design of shops throughout Cambridge and Boston often look more like products of curation than merchandising—schemes that result from personal, aesthetic choices from the owners that often happen to appeal to a variety of buying customers.
 
But can the practice of curating, an art in its own right, be applied to pushing product? Even though it serves a definite commercial end, the idea of “curating” a store may not necessarily be dismissed as just marketing, without art or design. Maybe it’s a form of art that brings beauty into the everyday.
 
CREATURE COMFORTS
 
As snow accumulates rapidly and melts on my glasses, I finally spot Bobby from Boston, a vintage menswear store. Tucked away among several galleries and cafes, it rests on the gentrified edge of the South End. I quickly turn up a narrow cobblestone alley and duck into the shop for refuge from the snow.
 
The store is warm and inviting, like an old library. Dark, weathered wood lines the store, and hanging, glowing orbs shed a soft, incandescent light. Owner Bobby Garnett has just gone out for a cigarette, but I don’t mind. As a keen thrift-shopper, I look through the dark, clean shelves of pants, jackets, and boots. The experience is worlds away from thrifting. It’s sometimes difficult to believe that the apparel is used.
 
Bobby from Boston was founded in 1992, but Bobby’s been in the business for more than 40 years. His first shop opened in ’71—a leather shop, totally different from the one I’m sitting in now. “The other shops I had were more of an Art Deco, chrome and glass feel.” Sounds keen.
But the decor of Bobby from Boston is a long way from Art Deco. “We try to have the feeling of [a store of the era]… anywhere between the 1800s to the 1930s,” he says. He was first inspired by a vintage store in Philadelphia—a small place called “Rosebud.” It was the first vintage store’s interior that he really liked.
 
But he doesn’t want the aesthetic to get in the way of comfort. It’s that comfort he found in English menswear shops—an aesthetic based on both style and function—which inspired him for this store. “I think it’s important, especially if you’re selling a used item, to make it comfortable to try it on, to look at it, make it easy by having everything organized,” he says. “People come in here, and…they don’t feel like they’re coming into a thrift store where it’s just racks and racks and racks of clothing; the whole place is very curated, you know?”
“Curated”—who would deny it?
 
TOP-DOWN ERGONOMICS
 
“Our inspiration comes from [our] home office, which is in Philadelphia,” says Katrine B. Hildebrandt-Hussey, a senior display coordinator at Anthropologie. A visual manager at Anthropologie is responsible for merchandising and overseeing displays. “My job is to conceptualize and execute those displays,” she says. Despite the “senior” in her title, Hildebrandt-Hussey has been at Anthropologie for less than three years. She received her Bachelor of Arts from Hartwick College and got a Masters in sculpting from Massachusetts College of Art and Design.
 
How do so many individual branches receive inspiration from a single office? We’re sitting on a leather couch in what appears to be a small living room on the top floor of the Harvard Square Anthropologie. Light streams through the glass wall and refracts in a sort of chandelier of glass spheres. The room is spacious, clean, and bright. It could easily appear sterile, but the faux living room feels intimate, homey, and definitely enviable—it’s a job well done.
 
As Hildebrandt-Hussey said, the basis of individual stores’ design comes from the home office in Philadelphia. The home office sends general concepts to its satellite stores, and it is then the job of the visual team to create in-store displays and designs based on that inspiration. The home office dictates that every room be based on a fictional person with a particular style and color preference. The visual team at each store then creates its own designs for that concept. Every Anthropologie store looks different for it, and if anyone has been inside an Anthropologie, he or she will agree the displays are stunning.
 
Often Hildebrandt-Hussey uses the merchandise as inspiration for the design of the store’s displays. “For instance, the dining table here has a lot of sea-related merchandise, and our display is going to be ocean-inspired,” she said. “So we’re using light fabrics that are sheer and wind-blown and rope.”
 
There’s little governance from the top, aside from the core concept given to individual stores. “It’s such an entrepreneurial company. [Home office] really want[s] each store to be unique and different, so there’s not too much that’s dictated,” Hildebrandt-Hussey says. It’s a relatively simple model that insures a reliability of aesthetic while allowing for the flexibility to appeal to smaller markets and preserve individual inspiration, all through a fascinating dissemination of inspiration. Even though there’s central guidance, Anthropologie leaves plenty of room for independent design choices in each of its stores.
 
DEMOCRATIC DESIGN
 
Meanwhile, boutiques and small chains don’t have the logistical challenge of creating a consistent experience across the country. Often, there are only one or two owners of some of the stores in Cambridge and Boston, and as a result, the stores become aesthetic extensions of the owners themselves.
 
Harvard Square’s Tess & Carlos is one such establishment that derives its unique aesthetic not from any deliberate, centralized design process, but from the bold choices made by the owners, Tess R. Enright and Carlos A. Pava. Tess & Carlos is a clothing distributor, distinguished by its curved display windows and off-center gold column. Despite its unconventional design, it’s not the first vendor visitors to the Square might explore. Perhaps it’s because the store is too dimly lit to see in from the outside, but it begs an investigation into the motivations behind the owners’ choices in their store design and displays.
 
I walk between the curved glass panels of Tess & Carlos, afraid that it’s closed or vacant because of the dim lighting. But when I walk in, I’m surprised and pleased to find an apparel vendor that is trendy and minimal, its interior design relying on glass and concrete. The lines of the establishment gently curve in contrast to the straight steel clothing racks. All of the merchandise is spread far apart and kept low to the ground. Behind a similarly curving counter is Tess Enright, a woman with intense eyes, but a wide smile.
 
The design of the store, inside and out, is one conceived and executed by singular forces. Pava designed the architecture of the Harvard Square location as well as the shops in Newton, Mass., Concord, Mass., and Pittsford, N.Y. Enright designs the displays and selects the merchandise. Together, the architecture and merchandising create a clean, minimal, open feel. “Stores should be very airy, so that you can feel like you can walk around,” Enright says.
 
Enright knows her general demographic—women, usually above 30—but she’s not trying to target anyone in particular. There haven’t been attempts to redesign the store to appeal to different or new customers, nor has there been a need for those attempts. “The store has stayed the same,” Enright says. “We’ve never had to change anything in the store because it’s so minimal and classic, so it really never goes out of style.” As far as Enright is concerned, Tess & Carlos is still ahead of its time, and I’m not sure who would disagree.
 
Talking to Bobby raises the same question—for whom is the store and merchandise designed, him or the customer? For customers, Bobby carefully arranges the store to make the merchandise look enticing, even like new. He goes as far as to apologize for a couple of boxes of shoes neatly tucked underneath and beside the pool table that he keeps in the center of the room. He organizes his stores to ensure that customers can easily browse in comfort.
 
It’s also the unique, irreplaceable vintage feel and aesthetic that completes the experience for customers—as well as for Bobby himself. “It’s for both [the customers and me]. I mean, it’s really important to the business because almost everybody that comes in here really loves the shop, you know?” Bobby says. But it’s clear immediately that the design and arrangement of the store isn’t just an advertising strategy—it’s what he loves. “That’s part of the fun for me. Besides the clothing, I like fixtures. If I weren’t doing this, I would probably have been a salvager.”
 
Bobby’s devotion to design is not as apparent inside the store as outside it—specifically at his warehouse in Lynn, about halfway between Salem and Revere. The warehouse is about twice as big as his regular store and packed with at least twice as much merchandise. But according to him, people can barely believe it’s a warehouse because it looks just like the store. “It’s organized like [the store], all old fixtures, pictures, you know?” he says. Why go to so much effort for a warehouse? “It’s just because if I’m going to be there, I want it to be pleasing to my eye and comfortable, and I want to be able to look at the stuff and enjoy it, not just be here working.”
 
These are people designing for themselves. In these small, quirky boutiques, the store is not separate from the owner. The store is the product of who the owner is. The successes of their businesses are not due to any brilliant marketing schemes. Patrons get to know the personality of the proprietors through their stores, and the stores are successful because customers come to like the owners as people.
 
BOXED IN
 
This group comprises some of the most eclectic stores in Cambridge and Boston, yet among the people who put forth these distinctive visions, Hildebrandt-Hussey is best able to describe design in terms of purposeful aesthetic choices. Perhaps it’s because she is the most classically trained, or perhaps just the existence of an articulated design structure at Anthropologie makes her best able to describe the store’s aesthetic. Boutique store owners, in contrast, are sometimes unable to clearly relate conscious design choices in words.
 
It’s not for a lack of purpose—it could just be a difficulty in verbally relating their visions. When asked to elaborate, Bobby and Enright seem bound to the wrong medium, perhaps because they are more grounded in physicality. “You can probably explain it better than I can,” Enright says, trailing off from a description of her aesthetic goals. Bobby is not often much clearer. Yet he seems like he’s had more practice than most—he routinely deals with interviewers, designers, and even Hollywood costume designers as they search through his store and warehouse.
 
At times he speaks indirectly about his role in design and arrangement, and often the way he speaks intimates more than the words he says. “That’s my job, I mean that’s what I live for. That’s what I live to do—is to do this, you know? It’s like, I’m a lucky dude to find this to keep me busy.” At times, it seems the owners are caught in their own boxes, able to physically create and design within the space, but unable to explain what they’ve done to the outside—except by letting others experience it.
 
That might be the best way to conceive of these stores, if we’re looking through an artistic lens. They are blank canvases to fill, and the canvas defines the piece of art as much as the painter defines the canvas. For Susan L. Corcoran, the founder and owner of Black Ink, it was the space that came to define her store. “It was about functionality, and we were always interested in industrial design and industrial products and parts that we could incorporate in the store,” she says.
 
When Black Ink first opened in Beacon Hill, the store measured less than 500 square feet. That’s tiny for a store, especially one as diverse as Black Ink. “It was a process which took many years,” Corcoran says. “You kind of refine and figure out how best to use all that space—that limited amount of space.” To maximize the space she had, Corcoran developed tall, adjustable, cube-based shelving. The supply of merchandise changes weekly, so it was the perfect solution. Products could be easily switched and reconfigured, and with the addition of a rolling library ladder, the little space was maximized. “When we got the opportunity to open a store in Harvard Square, we used the same model—it was just a little bigger.”
 
In Corcoran’s scenario, the analogy of a canvas seems all too apt. The design is contained and defined by the space. It’s a problem that seems tailored for Corcoran, who studied studio art in college. “It’s like an installation piece,” she says. “It’s like a daily installation, and you don’t know what’s going to happen when people come in and interact with it.”
 
ADVANTAGES OF AESTHETICS
 
Art is too often conceived as serving no useful purpose. It is premised in pleasure, in beauty, but it is not often utilitarian. People don’t typically see it as capable of solving problems. But why should this be the case? Why can everyday experience not constitute art? In some ways the design and arrangement of stores seems more challenging than creating art for art’s sake—the products need to sell. “The beauty of it is it’s very democratic,” Corcoran says about her own store. Merchandising can be a thing of beauty; store curation, a form of pop art.
 
Space and design within these stores is carved out by a personal need to create. Because of that, stores often reflect the way the owners see themselves. Even in a single branch of a large chain, there is ample opportunity for individual creativity, just as there are ample possibilities for customers to feel at home. So are they really curators? “I never really [thought I was] before, but so many people have told me that I am, that I’ve started to believe it,” Bobby says. Maybe he should.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Spoken word poetry is a medium with the potential to be thrilling and powerful. The artistic freedom it gives poets was evident in the sheer range of performances at the Harvard Speak Out Loud showcase on Saturday. The event was a presentation of pieces that Harvard students will perform at the Collegiate Unions Poetry Slam Invitational this weekend. The competitors, who will attend the upcoming competition held at Barnard College, are Misha Garrison-Desany ‘16, Melanie Wang ‘15, Bex Kwan ‘14, Jamie Banks ‘13, and Cassandra E. Euphrat Weston ’14.
  Speak Out Loud is a student-run organization founded in 2011 by Euphrat Weston ’14 and Kyra A. Atekwana ’14, who were struck by the absence of a spoken word organization on campus when they arrived at Harvard in 2010. “The first Wintersession where the UC offered funding, that happened to be in our first year [in existence], so we said we can pull together a spoken word workshop without us having very much experience. We were pretty nervous about it but it went really well, and the response was so overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic that we thought we can found a student group and we did," Euphrat Weston says.
The club now offers an entry into spoken word for those who have never participated in, or even witnessed, the experience of “spitting” spoken word poetry. The evening began with an open-mic where any member of the audience was encouraged to stand up and perform their own work. There were several original performances from artists who go to school in the area, including a group piece from the team at the Berklee School of Music. Inclusivity is a very important part of the spoken word phenomenon at Harvard; In that spirit, SOL sponsors weekly poetry workshops open for all to attend. “It's grown tremendously,” Euphrat Weston says of the club. “We really focus on community...so many amazing people have put in so much work to make this community what it is in just two years, which is amazing to reflect back on.” 
The beauty of spoken word poetry comes from its power to add dimensions to the poems. The words—one could almost say lyrics—serve as a skeleton for the poet’s expression. The artists use song, action, audience participation, and even dance to add depth to their pieces. This results in a tremendous range of different performances, ranging from rap to near-skits. Part of what gives the poetry so much force is the sheer level of emotion that can be introduced by varying the tone of voice alone.
The members of the SOL team and visiting speakers took a highly theatrical approach and blended truth and artifice in their words. “Spoken word is powerful but very, very dangerous,” said Kwan in one of the pieces, alluding to the fine line between truth and fiction in the works. 
An interesting feature of showcase was the highly personal subject matter of many of the poems. It is by no means uncommon for poets to write about their feelings and experiences, and throughout the event, poets explored gender, sexuality, class, race, family relationships and love in piercing detail. They were able to appeal even to those in the audience who had no such experiences, as was evidenced by an enthusiastic audience reaction. “[Slam poetry is about] getting to that raw human honesty,” SOL team coach Jason H. Simon-Bierenbaum says.
Members of the Harvard SOL team who are going to CUPSI spoke about having three categories of poems they will be performing—“queer” poems, letters addressing someone or something, and poems in which the speaker adopts a persona. One such poem was about Euphrat Weston’s imaginary “butt-alien” friend as a child. In another performance, Kwan and Euphrat Weston performed a duet poem in which Kwan described Euphrat Weston, while she was standing mutely on stage, which took on an entirely new dimension as they circled each other and spoke to one another while avoiding eye contact. This interaction brought a sense of complexity to the work.
Audience participation—snapping, humming, and vocal acknowledgement—was a prominent feature of the showcase. Not only did it enhance the layering of the performances, but also it created a connectedness between performers and the audience, and even among the audience members themselves. At several points in the night, the entire room began humming in approbation of a particularly moving line, encouragement growing as each poem reached its climax. No matter how foreign some of the situations described may have seemed, the undercurrent of community and common feeling was made even stronger by the call-and-response between the audience and the performer.
Despite being such a young organization, Harvard SOL seems to have already inspired a devoted and enthusiastic following, and appears likely to maintain a significant presence at Harvard. As evidenced by the avid vocalizations of the audience members and their apparent zeal for the performances, it is apparent that the early years of spoken word at Harvard are already successful ones.

The  one-hit wonder is a common trope in the music industry, and one that  serves as the backbone for Tom Hanks’s film “That Thing You Do!” which  was adapted and directed by Grace S. Sun ’13 and performed from Friday  to Sunday in Adams Pool Theatre. Guitarists Jimmy (Ryan C. Cutter ’13)  and Lenny (Erich P. Dylus ’14) ask Guy (Dylan A. Munro ’16), a jazz  drummer, to join their band after their previous drummer breaks his arm.  One thing leads to another and the band members, who have named  themselves named the Oneders and then the Wonders, get signed to  Play-Tone record label and start their quick ascension and fall from  music lore. Hanks’s screenplay and Sun’s adaption are both light and  flamboyant, though ultimately lacking depth. Sun’s production  successfully translates the movie’s popcorn-munching sensibilities and  fun, if inconsequential, storyline through clever direction and the  cast’s easy camaraderie. 
While  it took a little while for the actors to settle into their roles, once  the cast members get behind their instruments, each actor was able to  fully embody his role. All of the songs were played live, and it is  through these performances that the dynamics of the group and its  respective characters really came alive. Munro’s Guy was earnest and  charmingly goofy, personality traits that seemed to spring from his  fast-paced, enthusiastic drumming. In contrast to Munro’s easy stage  presence, Cutter played Jimmy with a suave attitude as he crooned and  leaned on Lenny. The separation between the audience and the production  faded during these musical performances, and those moments felt more  like snippets of a longer concert. The Wonders were vibrant and real  because the actors embodied their characters through an honest and and  passionate connection to the music.
Once  Mr. White (Sam R. Reynolds ’16), the band’s manager, entered the stage,  the production hit its stride. Reynolds’s portrayal of White was  fraught with dry humor and just enough heart to make him endearing.  While White was never at the forefront, he acted as the linking thread  between the other characters and kept them grounded. Whether he was  humorously telling Lenny to check up on the pilot during a flight to a  gig in order to shoo Lenny away or chastising Jimmy for his lack of  sensitivity, Reynolds’ straight man to the band functioned as the  primary conscience of the play.
Sun’s  interpretation of Hanks’s film was effective primarily due to her use  of space and the appropriate lighting design by Rebecca J. Mazur ’15, a  Crimson Arts editor. A movie can present a story that takes place in  multiple locations at the same time, but the challenge becomes harder on  stage where the luxury of simultaneous shots does not exist. To bypass  this issue, Sun inverted and segmented her stage; at times the corner of  the stage became an announcer’s booth, while at other times the stage  was separated to create a spot for an “audience” for the Wonders within  the play. Sometimes, even, the main stage flipped so that it became the  backstage, like the scene in which another artist on the same record  label, Freddy Fredrickson (Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey ’13, a Crimson Arts  editor) sang “Mr. Downtown” with the Wonders watching Fredrickson from  backstage. As Freddy Fredrickson sang, the Wonders were in darkness, and  when the scene switched to the band, Fredrickson froze in place as the  spotlight shifted to the other scene. 
Sun  used video and music between scenes to orient the audience to the  plot’s larger jumps in time. While most of the transitions were typical  blackouts with music playing in the background, the video montage after  intermission—a wink to the play’s silver screen beginnings—served as the  major link between the first and second halves of the play. The video  showed different scenes of the band on the road over a period of months  as well as the burgeoning relationship between Guy and Faye (Taylor L.  Vandick ’16), Jimmy’s girlfriend. Without it, some of the developments  in the second half would have seemed out of place. 
The  play ended with the cast pulling the audience onto the stage as the  band played one final time, an enthusiastic performance that brought the  production’s bright and light-hearted tone full circle. The play was  not particularly serious, but that was not the intention of Hanks’s  screenplay or Sun’s adaptation. The separate aspects of the play were  not particularly memorable, but the overall sentiment was fun and  enjoyable. On the whole, the play was a bit like whipped cream; it was  sugary and airy, a fun topping without too much staying power.

A  play about a house that has been and signified so many things at once—a  lovable home, a verbal war zone, a forgotten dream—could come off as a  dizzying jumble of moving, mashed up parts. But while “Acres of  Diamonds” is about all these things and much more, they came together in  a neatly packaged portrayal of one family’s messy reality.
The  play, which ran from Thursday to Saturday at the Loeb Ex, is the latest  and perhaps greatest creation of writer and director Andy J. Boyd ’14  (“Affordable Rates and Color TV,” “Bitch: A Play About Antigone”), whose  wide variety of plays resist categorization but not progression. “Acres  of Diamonds” paradoxically broke new ground for Boyd in its grounded  focus on a deceptively simple subject. 
The  story of a family conflict over selling the inherited estate is not  exactly original. Additionally, Boyd infuses this family drama with the  familiar setup of chasing the American Dream, symbolically setting the  opening scene on the Fourth of July. Still, Boyd manages to make the  story his own by bringing it into the present day, in the aftermath of  the last recession, which gives the theme of lost and broken American  dreams added poignancy and realism. The play abounds in sharp dialogue  that spans the whole spectrum of adolescent and adult worry while still  adeptly leaving much unsaid. 
The  cast superbly carried off the tensions in the play with both mature  composure and intense emotional delivery. Apart from Danielle T. Lessard  ’16 (Jo-Jo), who seemed way too old to be an eight-year-old, and  Mallory J. Weiss ’15 (Abigail), who seemed way too young to be a mother,  the nine-member cast made for a believable, dysfunctional family.  However, the three main siblings especially stood out: Barbara (Amy K.  Sparrow ’15), Mary-Kay (Mary C. Hallowell ’14) and James (Joshua G.  Wilson ’14). Sparrow played Barbara as a strong matriarch who expertly  balanced her roles as a pillar of strength, a soothing presence, and a  voice of reason in the chaotic home. She thoughtfully delivered the  aphoristic wisdoms of the play, stating, “We live in these places, but  they live in us too,” and “We’ve taken care of this house; now it’s time  it took care of us.” Hallowell as Mary-Kay also alternated gracefully  between her double mask as an independent free spirit and a struggling  single mother. Both onstage sisters had the added challenge of reacting  to and controlling the explosive temper of their brother, James, on  whose broad shoulders rests the entire momentum of the play. 
As  the tragicomic figure, James stands for all that is both irrational and  understandable about wanting to keep the house, and though his actions  are rarely defensible, the characters constantly reassured one another  that “he means well.” However, to his credit, Wilson did not try to buy  the audience’s affection for his character, whose repeated rages and  “goddamns” made him more of a crude Uncle Vanya type than a downtrodden  Willy Loman. It was a thrill to see Wilson, who has acted in numerous  Shakespeare plays on campus, morph into a trash-talking hick so  completely. 
In  fact, the one complaint with these roles is that they fit almost too  neatly into their pigeonholes. In trying to add complexity to the family  dynamics, Boyd fell back on stock characters, especially for the  children, who form a perfectly diverse group of misfits, including a  pothead, a gay cousin, a college dropout, and an orphan. Although Karl  C. Kopczynski ’15 (Tommy) and Amelia Q. Friedman ’14 (Angela) acted  their roles with the appropriate degrees of passion or indifference, the  stage became overcrowded by all those jabbering egos, each following  his or her competing storyline. 
Part  of the claustrophobia is intentionally reinforced by the set, designed  by Heather D. Mauldin ’14: a beautifully constructed, one-room interior  of the house where the family eats, sleeps, and argues. Confining as the  place may be, it is never static and, in some ways, it is not material  either. For the “house” they are fighting over is really a figment of  their distant memories, buried in the picture of the house on the wall,  which the characters symbolically tear at one point. For James, the  house is also buried in the backyard, the eponymous “acres of diamonds,”  where he hopes to regrow his yeoman roots from a pathetic “pile of  shit.”
The  title of the play is taken from Russell Conwell’s famous lectures in  the Civil War era on finding value in one’s own backyard. Rather than  leaving it there, however, Boyd’s play asks the more probing question of  what to do if all the diamonds have already been dug up and spent? With  his characteristic wit and perspicacity, Boyd has dug up enough nuggets  of wisdom on his own to ensure that there is something for everyone to  chew on. Rather than trying to digest it all, however, the only sane  option is to walk away from the abandoned pile of manure with the sense  of having learned and lived through something of undeniable worth—that  is, the drama of these disillusioned times.

The HBO eagle landed, and hundreds of Harvard geeks flocked to the Science Center last Wednesday night at the irresistible promise of viewing the first episode of the third season of “Game of Thrones” a few days before the less fortunate greater public (Plus, once something becomes an official event, it’s totally condoned to skip studying). A few lucky attendees of the screening won hats and even an iPad; however, unlike the game of thrones itself, this was not a win-or-die scenario, and the other guests were able to sit unmolested as the barrage of violence, conspiracy, and sex began.
With a seemingly endless conveyor belt of characters that he kills off with industrial efficiency, George R.R. Martin—the author of the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series the show is adapted from—has indeed created a phenomenon as difficult to film as it is to predict. Most viewers come to the show without reading the novels and generally agree that the production stands well on its own merit; but how do the novels’ fans, a much smaller group, view the series as an adaptation? Whatever criticisms one might have for the quality of the series—either novels or television—the HBO adaptation has proved itself a highly effective conception of Westeros and its squabbling inhabitants.
The far-reaching maps and family hierarchies of Martin’s world are two of the most unique and fascinating features of his series—features that film would not be able to showcase, barred from providing due time and consideration. This level of detail involves sets, costumes, and an army of bit-part characters. Any film adaptation of the novels would stretch far beyond the serialization of “Harry Potter” and the four-hour director’s cuts of the “Lord of the Rings.” The episodic structure of the TV series not only allows indefinite extension of the storyline (and revenues), but also it allows time to dwell on the intricacies of culture and backdrop that are inherent in Martin’s work.
That said, some important parts of the novels are missing. The HBO series spends less time on the cliffhangers and hints that Martin strews so lovingly throughout his narrative. Who is Jon Snow’s mother? What is Varys’s agenda? Is there any way to pass the time in Westeros beyond murder and sex? “Game of Thrones” holds an interesting place in television mostly in that the media treats as suspense while the books have been out for almost two decades; simply, how does an adaptation like this create tension? Those who watch the series and never read the books are spoon-fed information in pre-determined packages, and the question becomes “what will happen next?” rather than “here’s what I think will happen next. How about you?” After all, once you have come to terms with the knowledge that your favorite character is unlikely to live out the novel, let alone the saga, all you can do is attempt to prophesy the manner of their imminent—and probably gruesome—doom. What with Martin’s largely one-dimensional characters, a substantial proportion of what makes the writing so fun is coming up with potential plotlines and conspiracy theories. Unfortunately, since the TV series is so far behind the published books—although catching up quickly—it is not nearly as much of a challenge to predict what has already been written. 
Martin’s world is peopled with fairly simple characters, the good, the far more populous bad, and the ugly. There are more complicated individuals—some of them genuinely original and compelling, like Tyrion Lannister—but by and large, with the rate they are introduced and summarily executed, there is little time for character development. As a result the actors of the HBO series bring consistently fresh shades of quality, allowing the TV series to take on a life of its own, independent of the novels. There are some fantastic performances, such as those of Jack Gleeson as the infuriatingly vicious Joffrey, Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen, and, of course, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion. While the nature of an adaptation means that those who met the characters as written fiction will have their internal image challenged by a new idea, it is hard to deny that the spirit of these primary characters has been artfully captured both by the actors and by the script they are given.
And yet, even without knowledge of the books necessarily, a hall full of people exhaled in shock as the credits began to roll across the screen at the Wednesday showing. In an audience of fans—of both the novels and the program—it would be hard to find a person left unenthused by the next installment of the saga.

It dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create,” wrote Samuel Taylor Coleridge of the Imagination. “It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead.” He penned this celebrated definition in a chapter of “Biographia Literaria” titled “On the Imagination, or Esemplastic Power.”  In that chapter, the poet, critic, and philosopher also coined a new word, “esemplastic,” to articulate the Imagination’s unique uniting force, its power to mold disparate objects into one.
William H. Gass’s latest novel “Middle C” might achieve Coleridge’s poetic ideal with its masterful prose. In his literary theory, Gass is chiefly concerned with the ontological transformation of language into literature, and he incorporates many of Coleridge’s ideas. With his intellectual project underpinning the novel, Gass certainly demands a lot of his readers: plot takes a backseat to explosive sentences, elaborate metaphors, and abounding references. But the fundamental unit of Gass’s language is the sentence—each ekes out a life of its own—and though the driving force of “Middle C” might not be immediately evident, the resounding truth of the novel lives in the book’s close. Gass’s diction is, in an uprooted word, esemplastic.
The storyline of the novel is less plot than premise, a stage for Gass’s performance. The novel follows one Joseph Skizzen who immigrates to Woodbine, Ohio and under a sinister pretense becomes a self-taught professor of musicology at a small college. His parents, Rudi and Miriam, leave Austria in the ‘30s fearing the nation’s approaching fate even before the Anschluss. They aren’t Jewish but claim to be so and flee to England, where Rudi disappears. Miriam crosses the Atlantic with Joseph and sister Deborah, and after they land the trio attempts an ordinary middle-American life, despite their dubious background. From then on, Joseph Skizzen’s life is built with falsehood as infrastructure. He fabricates his past—replete with forged academic credentials, fake driver’s licenses, and fictional violinist fathers in the Vienna Philharmonic. Ultimately, the adrenaline of the novel is created sentence by sentence: Gass’s construction of the truth mirrors Skizzen’s alternating impulses to curate and to compose.
Gass assigns Joseph Skizzen, and his father alike, three identities in the novel. While Joseph’s father adopts new identities to match the circumstances, Joseph’s shifts in selfhood seem to happen to him rather than by him.  His father passed from Rudi Skizzen the Austrian, through Yankel Fixel the Jew, to Raymond Scofield the Englishman. Though Joseph simply sets out as Joey, crosses to Joseph, and arrives at Professor Skizzen, he retains his father’s deceitful inclinations. He zigzags to middle-age with no companions except his aging mother, and with few diversions aside from music.
Skizzen does, however, have one peculiar hobby, which becomes a metaphor that wants to transcend metaphor, unifying the object with its meaning. He obsessively curates an Inhumanity Museum in the attic of his Victorian house. In newspaper clippings, photographs, and paintings, Skizzen exhibits atrocity.  Gass’s introduction of Skizzen’s Inhumanity Museum displays Gass’s lyrical genius and the way that his language aims to construct rather than describe. Among the museum’s contents are “clips from films that showed what struck the eyes of those who first entered the extermination camps—careless heaps of skins and bones, entirely tangled, exhibiting more knees and elbows than two-pair-to-a-death ought allow.”
Skizzen’s curation of the Inhumanity Museum—a self-conscious construction of metaphor by Gass—parallels his other fixation: throughout the novel, Skizzen attempts to compose a single sentence that will condemn humanity. Its initial iteration reads, “The fear that the human race might not survive has been replaced by the fear that it will endure.” Skizzen’s struggle to perfect this single sentence displays Gass’s own conviction and corresponding goal. Language, when used correctly, can become the thought itself. The impulse is not a creative one, and in fact Skizzen struggles to create. Gass writes of a short verse that Skizzen had just drafted: “Professor Skizzen thought it should be sung. He planned to compose some music. If only he knew how.”
Gass’s sentences are notes with their own frequencies, counterpoints, tonics and modulations in what may be the philosopher-writer’s last aria. And while the sentences themselves propel the novel forward, they are copper and tin, not bronze. They are the Imagination that transforms Gass’s language into literature, novel into truth. As Skizzen’s first piano instructor bluntly poses, “What are you going to remember—the notes? No. The tune.”

It's right there in the Declaration of Independence. It's right there in the Bill of Rights. It's right there in the head of every sensible American citizen: We have a right to life.
And nobody, including the president himself, can deny us of that right—at least not without granting us due process first, not without a trial and not without a jury. The point being, even the president of the United States does not—and cannot be allowed to—have the power to order U.S. citizens killed at his own discretion. He cannot have this power, arguably the most quintessential of all tyrannical powers, because it would render null the most basic checks and balances placed on him, would let him act as judge, jury, and executioner all in one, and would directly defy the Fifth Amendment, which guarantees that no person “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Yet it is this exact power, the power to kill U.S. citizens, which the Obama administration now claims the president possesses.
A few weeks ago, Attorney General Eric H. Holder stated that, in an “extraordinary circumstance,” he could see the president being authorized to use lethal force, such as a drone strike, against a U.S. citizen without first awarding them the traditional due process. That should be allowed to sink in for a moment. The president of the United States, the leader of the free world, is now having his administration claim that he can execute any citizen who he sees as a viable and imminent threat, without judge or jury involved. To justify this, Obama’s Justice Department has disturbingly declared that the Fifth Amendment’s due process can be wholly satisfied by, to quote the New York Times, “internal deliberations in the executive branch.” Forget having to prove in court that a person is guilty of any crimes. Now, apparently, the executive branch can simply decree a citizen a present danger to society, and, in turn, can assassinate that person at will.
Holder qualified his statement the following day, explaining that drones will never be used against Americans not engaged in active combat. However, this reassurance comes from the Attorney General of the same administration that considers all military-age males caught in drone strikes overseas to be active militants. So not the most reliable of sources on who is and who isn’t actually engaged in combat. This also comes from the same Holder who last March stated that Obama’s targeted killings are not assassinations because “assassinations are unlawful,” implying that when Obama sentences someone to death, say by drone strike, that death is innately lawful, and thus simply couldn’t be an assassination. This is possibly Holder’s most Orwellian justification of Obama’s “targeted killings”—or assassinations, as they’re known by the dictionary and everybody else in the world—because it upholds these killings’ legality by insinuating that such legality is inherent in the president’s command. Holder’s statement more than calls to mind Nixon’s infamous explanation that, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.”
To call this most recent expansion of executive power truly frightening is not alarmist in the least. It doesn't matter what you think of President Obama or whether you trust him to be circumspect when using this lethal power. If you give one president the ability to end someone's life, you give all following presidents the ability to do so as well. So to all the loyal Democrats defending Obama’s authority to kill, keep in mind that the next president to grab hold of that lethal authority might be more of the George W. Bush breed. Obama has already proven, when he had American-born Anwar Al-Awaki killed by a drone strike in 2011, that the president can assassinate U.S. citizens abroad. Now, if he has his way and makes such strikes legal here at home, a future president could feasibly commit a similar assassination within an American city or town.
I’m not implying that Obama is about to rain down drone hellfire on you anytime soon—just that he and all the presidents that follow him now have the power to do so. They do not have to prove to the public or to a judge that you are guilty of any crimes. They just have to decide, behind the White House’s closed doors, that you are a current threat. And with that decision they can end your life.
This newly claimed assassination power is only the most recent (and most egregious) in a series of executive overreaches committed in the name of fighting terror. Compared to those that came before it, though, this most recent assault on liberty strikes a bit closer to home—literally.

“Look at me! Look me in the eye!”
When I was very young I was informally diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. I didn’t play normally and I had memorized the entire New York City subway map. My mom would hold my face against hers to force me to make eye contact.
In the past two decades, autism has become a catch-all diagnosis for children whose behavior appears antisocial. A widely cited 2012 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about one in 88 children in the United States has an autism spectrum disorder. The “spectrum” describes a wide range of conditions, from the milder Aspergers syndrome to the much more severe neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome. All are characterized by repetitive behaviors and some degree of impairment in social and communications skills, usually starting around the age of four.
Autism in America today is serially misunderstood and misdiagnosed. Our ignorance threatens our children and economy, and Harvard is uniquely positioned to help.
We think we know what to look for. From Dustin Hoffman in “Rain Man” to Danny Pudi on “Community” and Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC’s “Sherlock,” popularculture has created an entrenched image of a person on the spectrum—male, usually white, awkward, brilliant in specific subjects, inaccessible, somewhat self-involved. Often, as in the character of Sheldon in “The Big Bang Theory,” the archetypes of the nerd and the slightly autistic appear interchangeable.
When I was in high school I heard the label “Aspies”—referring to Asperger’s syndrome—applied to classmates known for academic success but poor social skills. The trope has entered the popular lexicon. But we blur the condition’s definition at our peril.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that the spike in diagnoses is connected to popular perceptions. A 2010 study found that African-American children were 2.6 times less likely to be diagnosed with an ASD, which the study’s authors attribute to “possible variations in parents’ descriptions of symptoms, clinician interpretations and expectations, or symptom presentation.” In other words, parents and physicians alike are more likely to diagnose children that fit the popular archetype. And a child living under a false diagnosis will grow up under the mistaken belief that there is something wrong with her, a fear that can compound the sense of isolation and produce its own problems.
Misdiagnosis is so prevalent partly because we still don’t really understand autism. While various theories exist—it seems to be genetic in some cases and may be related to synaptic dysfunction—we know little about what causes it and nothing about how to prevent it. We also don’t know why some children diagnosed with milder spectrum disorders seem to leave the spectrum entirely in later life, sometimes within only a few years. I might have been one of these—or just a geeky kid who liked trains.
Unfortunately, some cases of autism are serious, and the lack of scientific consensus has pushed many parents to desperate measures. An infamous (and now discredited) 2001 article linked autism to mercury in vaccines and prompted widespread fears about immunization. Old fears die hard. The internet is awash with non-peer reviewed reports that autism is linked to all kinds of environmental causes. Con artists and informal operations offer dangerous alternative treatments, none of them FDA-approved. Some parents have turned to chelation therapy, the chemical removal of heavy metals from the body, and hyperbaric oxygen chambers. These treatments recall the barbaric methods once used to treat mental illness, but they also drive home how helpless parents of many autistic children feel.
If left unaddressed, this epidemic of mistreatment and misdiagnosis will be as disastrous for our economy as for our children. Autism is expensive. According to a study by Michael Ganz at the Harvard School of Public Health, each case of autism carries a social cost of $3.2 million over a lifetime. And care is not cheap, sometimes costing $50 thousand or more per year. We must guarantee treatment, but reserve it only for those who need it.
Progress has been slow in part because autism research is underfunded and under-resourced. Last June a freezer malfunction in Harvard’s Brain Tissue Resource Center destroyed 53 preserved autistic brains, a third of the collection, which is still the largest in the world. The catastrophe set research back years, as one of the main limits on progress is a lack of well-preserved tissue samples.
So what can we do? First of all, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates that some, but not all, insurance plans cover applied behavior analysis, the most effective clinical treatment for autism. We should call on Congress to amend the law so that all American families are covered.
Second, Harvard should throw its weight behind a public campaign to draw dollars from the Department of Health to expand its unique program in autism research. It can also work to publicize the great service autistic men and women can do for our understanding of autism by agreeing to donate their brains for research after death.
Third, students at Harvard can help by being more thoughtful and aware. We must recognize that we have peers here both on and off the spectrum who feel isolated and sometimes act in ways that appear awkward or even antisocial. Regardless of condition: patience, respect, and a little empathy—not pity—go a long way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There are two kinds of marriage,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Wednesday, “the full marriage, and then this sort of skim milk marriage.”
Ginsburg was referring to the effects of the Defense Against Marriage Act, the 1996 statute that denies gay married couples 1,100 federal benefits that straight married couples enjoy. Last week, the Court heard cases challenging the constitutionality of both DOMA and Proposition 8, California’s state ban on gay marriage. DOMA and Prop 8 discriminate indefensibly, denying homosexual citizens the equal treatment under the law that the 14th Amendment to the Constitution affords them. The Supreme Court has a moral and legal obligation to strike both policies down.
The Court could take multiple avenues in its Prop 8 decision, but its soundest option is to not only affirm the initiative’s unconstitutionality, but also to recognize a broad, national right to same-sex marriage. Invalidating DOMA would then pave the final stretch of the path to marriage equality.
Prop 8, like DOMA, has its roots planted firmly in what Justice Kagan called “fear… dislike… [and] animus.”  In fact, in drafting DOMA, House lawmakers stated, “Civil laws that permit only heterosexual marriage reflect and honor a collective moral judgment about human sexuality.  This judgment entails… moral disapproval of homosexuality.”  Moral disapproval based solely on an immutable characteristic like sexual orientation is plain intolerance.  It has no place in a nation founded on the precept that “all men are created equal.”
The public largely agrees, more and more so every day. This February, a national CBS poll revealed that 54 percent of adult respondents approve of same-sex marriage, marking a continuation in the trend of increasing support: Starting in 2010, statistics first began to show a majority of Americans in favor of allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. And young people, defined as between the ages of 18 and 29 in a November Gallup poll, stand behind gay marriage in even greater numbers, with 73 percent voting in favor. This sea change in public opinion only reinforces the need for a Supreme Court decision that enshrines marriage equality.
The Supreme Court must not duck the issues it heard last week. Gay citizens and their families cannot afford to wait until little by little, bit by bit, states and lower courts open their minds and city halls to all marriages, regardless of the brides’ and grooms’ sexual orientations. Same-sex couples across the country deserve and need the benefits, both tangible and intangible, that straight couples reap from marrying right now.
The United States has a history of both prejudice and progress. The fight for gay marriage carries on the tradition of the civil rights movement and the struggle for women’s equality. Today, gay couples are barred from pursuing happiness for no reason but bigotry. Tomorrow, we hope all citizens will be free to live, love, and marry as they choose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do you really think a Holocaust could happen here?” I asked. “I have all my papers in ready just in case,” my septuagenarian neighbor replied.
That woman is now in her 80s, but the exchange has stuck with me, and it always surfaces in my mind around this time of year, as we commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day and celebrate Israeli independence. If I found her sense of vulnerability unsupported, I shared her implicit sensibility, a hard truth of the 1940s: Only a Jewish state and a Jewish military can be depended upon to protect the Jews.
Frightfully, anti-Semitic incidents are spiraling upward in Europe, and the Jew is menaced from both ends of the political spectrum. Fixated on Muslim immigration, chauvinists and neo-Nazi retreads are momentarily occupied, but they have no great love of him, a threat, if less than in times past, to national purity. Some communists and socialists, despite their pretensions to universalism, are also purveyors of anti-Semitism. The wealthy Jew is the class enemy of a new European proletariat of Third World émigrés, the booster of the racist, settler-colonial Zionist enterprise. Thus, the far-right and the hard-left are united in seeing the Jew as an alien, the agent of a foreign power, i.e., Israel.
In fact, the Jew and Zionism are increasingly linked in the European mind. According to the Anti-Defamation League’s 2012 study of European anti-Semitism, 45 percent of French and 55 percent of Hungarians think Jews are more loyal to Israel than to their respective home countries;
12 percent of French and 27 percent of Hungarians say their opinions of Jews are influenced by Israel’s actions. Former Yale professor Charles A. Small has even demonstrated  that in Europe anti-Zionist sentiment predicts Jew-hatred. So when the liberal-left, in its poor imitation of Murrowesque outrage, intones that “criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitic,” one must understand this as a statement of ideology, not absolute fact.
Though anti-Semitism is real and the Jew is persecuted, he is not a helpless victim. In my last column, I deplored this narrative, rendered a tall tale by the establishment of the state of Israel. The individual Jew has agency. He can escape his suffering by making aliyah. (Many French Jews have already bought homes in Israel, inflating the real estate market.) In the form of the Israel Defense Forces, which have intervened in Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Arab world, the Jewish people have a means of collective defense, something they lacked during the Holocaust.
But anti-Zionists harboring anti-Semitic views are much more dangerous than the old Jew-haters. Objecting to Jewish nationalism in particular, they seek to reprise the Achille Lauro, standing aside as others try to push the Jew off-deck, denying him a life-boat. Often, this stance is justified by nothing more than the academic equivalent of je ne sais quoi. Others are subtler, claiming Israel should not exist because it is impossible for a Jewish state to be a democracy.
A few weeks ago in The New York Times, Joseph Levine, a professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst (and a modern-day Josephus of sorts), advanced this specious line of argument. According to him, only civic nationalism, predicated on common values, is acceptable in the 21st century, especially in states home to multiple ethnic groups. Zionism, he avers, is exclusively ethnic, and in a country where 25 percent of the citizenry is non-Jewish, this means the state favors a particular group and is therefore undemocratic.
For one, this analysis ignores Zionism’s civic component; Jewishness is not a mere sanguinary identity. Just as Frenchmen, whatever their ethnic origin, can cleave to the ideals of liberty, fraternity, and equality, any person can convert to the universal religion of Judaism and be eligible for Israeli citizenship. Secondly, the notion that Israel is the only “democratic” state where the system structurally favors an ethnic sub-group is fallacious. Ireland and Germany both have provisions that privilege citizenship applications from people of Irish and German descent over those of others. Most European countries give Christian festival days off. Italy marks the anniversary of its unification, when most ethnic Italians were brought under one flag. These countries have sizable immigrant Muslim minorities, so are they undemocratic? Ultimately, Levine misapprehends the nature of democracy. It is possible for a democratic state to enshrine the national rights of a majority, providing it ensures the full civil rights of all. In its Declaration of Independence, Israel endeavors to do so. Unfortunately, Arabs, while given the vote, face rampant discrimination within Israeli society.
That makes the Jewish state a flawed democracy, but certainly not an ethnic oligarchy. We must be clear about that, lest haters and liars distract from one of the great lessons of the last century.

Increased application rates of highly selective schools and the fixed number of spots available have led to speculation that the recent decline in Harvard’s acceptance rate shows no signs of slowing anytime soon.
The College accepted a record low 5.8 percent of applicants this year, the seventh consecutive decline.
“I do think it’s going to get worse before it’s going to get better,” said Bari Norman, the president of Expert Admissions, a professional college advising service for students.
“The lower [a college’s admissions rate] goes, the more enticing it becomes.”
Norman, a former admissions officer at Barnard College, said that the increasingly unpredictable nature of college admissions everywhere acts as an impetus for students to “cover their bases” by applying to more schools.
Michael Goran, director and lead educational consultant at IvySelect, attributed the growing attractiveness of highly selective schools to “the name, and the prestige of the institutions,” saying that most students don’t “get caught up in that decreasing number.”
Norman explained that the increasingly unpredictable nature of college admissions everywhere as an impetus for students to be apply to more schools just in case, a potential cause behind the increasing application numbers.
While in the past the average student would apply to five or six schools, Sarah Rath—an admissions consultant at Top Test Prep—said that in her experience, the average for students now is closer to 15 or 20.
“The fact that Harvard has one additional supplement, in cases when Columbia has three and Brown has quite of few...gives students the allure of any Ivy without being daunting,” Goran said.
Norman said that admissions rates are likely to continue to decline even if application numbers drop slightly.
“As places like Harvard become more selective and therefore less predictable in terms of what students can expect back—even when they are in the good range for being considered for admission—they’re going to apply to more places,” Norman said.
The strategy of applying to more schools is a good one for students, Norman said. Still, she said that the effect of this strategy is that acceptance numbers can be expected to decrease across the board because the number of spots to fill does not increase.
At Harvard, the relatively high acceptance rate for students who apply early makes the regular acceptance rate seem that much smaller. Since it was reinstated two years ago, the program has seen a steady 18 percent acceptance rate.
As more students are accepted under the early admissions program, increasingly fewer are drawn from the regular applicant pool.
Still, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that applying early does not improve an applicant’s chances. Rather, the early pool’s credentials are “stronger than the credentials, on average, of regular action applicants,” according to Fitzsimmons.
Norman predicted that Harvard’s admission rate will continue to decline and that other highly selective schools will continue to hover close by.
“[Harvard] does tend to anchor everything else,” she said. “If it moves, other places will move with it.”

Administrators and faculty are poised to consider changes to the daily academic schedule following the announcement this February that Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will move to Allston in as little as five years.
Three task forces on class schedules, transportation, and SEAS concentrator life were recently established to “mitigate problems that may arise from the physical distance [between Cambridge and Allston],” said Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in an interview with The Crimson last month. Garber will oversee the committees in order to facilitate cross-University discussions, according to SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray.
To help students get to class on time, the Task Force on Class Schedules—co-chaired by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and Deputy Provost Peggy Newell—might consider altering class times or lengthening the seven-minute window between classes, according to senior administrators.
“There will be more and more cross-school teaching in the future,” Murray said. “That means scheduling of classes needs to change, even if SEAS didn’t move to Allston.”
In an interview with The Crimson in February, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that course schedules were a concern even before the SEAS move was announced.
“We already have a problem today in that our campus is... larger than seven minutes between classes,” Smith said. “This is an issue, and we have an opportunity as we think about expanding our campus further to say, ‘Alright, what should the academic day look like?’”
Current students agreed that the issues addressed by the task forces are particularly important for SEAS to maintain growing student interest.
“If you know you’re going to miss the first 10, 15 minutes of lecture because your lecture is far away, you will be naturally inclined to try to find something that would fit your schedule better,” said David A. DiCiurcio ’15, a member of SEAS’ Space Steering Committee. “If Harvard doesn’t work this properly... you will have people deciding to try to go into concentrations that are not SEAS-based.”
Computer science professor David C. Parkes, a co-chair of the Transportation Task Force alongside Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, wrote in an email that while the task force has not yet convened, it will eventually investigate a “multimodal transportation solution” to connect Cambridge and Allston.
The third task force, chaired by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Area Dean for Bioengineering Robert D. Howe, will look to ensure that the experience of SEAS students is not diminished in any way by the move, Garber said.
Earlier this year, SEAS also announced a Space Steering Committee composed of SEAS faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate concentrators that will consolidate input on the Allston planning process. Yet despite the efforts of administrators, Katherine T. Cagen ’14, one of the students on the committee, said that many SEAS affiliates may still feel that their opinions are underrepresented.
“I think a lot of faculty still feel like their input may not be considered, that they may be wasting their time by expressing these things.” Cagen said. “The fact that they were not consulted before the decision to move SEAS was made was I think a huge error on the part of the administration, and I think that’s something they’re going to have to overcome for the rest of this process.”

This fall, thousands of students around the world will have a chance to whip chocolate emulsions under the guidance of culinary experts and Harvard professors with the launch of SPU27x: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.” The introduction of SPU27x will mark edX’s first course with a lab component.
EdX, the nonprofit, online learning initiative launched by Harvard and MIT approaching its one-year anniversary this May, has rapidly expanded to 12 institutional partners and over 800,000 learners.
Physics professor David A. Weitz, who co-teaches the course, characterized SPU27x as “a way to teach science to people who otherwise do not normally engage with it,” and said that he thinks that the course’s popularity on campus suggests it may have a large global appeal.
“Teaching science of cooking is a good way to teach science: it’s effective, people are engaged, and it hits many of the high points of basic science education in a way that people are able to relate to and understand,” said Michael P. Brenner, a professor at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who co-teaches the class with Weiz.
Brenner and Weitz said that the logistics of the laboratory elements of SPU27x are still under discussion and will face certain challenges when applied on an international scale. Specifically, they pointed to the unavailability of certain ingredients in certain countries and the variability of cooking equipment among students as issues the course will have to overcome.
Weitz and Brenner also said that developing the course for edX will lead to improvements to the course offered on campus. For example, some segments will be filmed inside the restaurants of featured guest chefs. And rather than limiting one class to a chef’s presentation and the next to scientific analysis, cohesive 10-minute videos of both can be combined in one meeting.
These videos, according to Weitz, could also allow for scientifically inclined students to dive more deeply into the material if interested.
“The videos could provide a deeper explanation of the science that someone without that background wouldn’t watch” he said.

Even though a long-awaited discussion on a school-wide honor code will take precedence on the agenda of this month’s Faculty meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, professors said they still expect to find time to discuss secret email searches uncovered in early March.
Tuesday’s meeting will be the first since revelations that Harvard administrators authorized the covert search of 16 resident deans’ email accounts last fall, opening what many have called a breach of trust between the faculty and administrators. The searches have prompted many to call for greater transparency and an assurance from the administration that faculty privacy is protected.
But the meeting is also the first chance faculty will have to discuss the implications of the Government 1310 cheating scandal and broader questions of academic integrity at Harvard, a dialogue absent from recent faculty meetings.
Mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid said he hopes that email searches are addressed but is glad to see the discussion shaped by academic integrity.
“I think that on balance, whether the process works well, I would say that if we look at these three items—the emails, the cheating scandal, and the SEAS issue—they have not been handled correctly,” Schmid said, the latter referencing the announcement that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would move to Allston.
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, who sits on the Faculty Council and chairs the Faculty Docket Committee, said the meeting’s agenda was crafted to give faculty a chance to talk about the broader issues of trust and communication raised by the email searches, while still allowing for several concrete proposals to move forward. These include a Committee on Academic Integrity report and a proposal for changes to reading and exam period, both presented by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
While many professors said they were surprised the searches were not included in the meeting’s docket, most said they are confident that the issue will be addressed explicitly during question time and implicitly in the docketed agenda items.
Jasanoff said that she and the Docket Committee expect both Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and University President Drew G. Faust to make statements about the searches.
“The email searches themselves as a fact, they happened, and we expect to hear certain responses from administrators about them, but in and of themselves they are not so much something that needs to be discussed,” Jasanoff said. “The bigger questions about trust, ...those are things that really need to be discussed and need to be discussed in the many, many forms in which they manifest themselves.”

The U.S. District Court of Massachusetts denied Harvard’s request last week to try a class-action lawsuit in federal court filed against the University by the wait staff at Loeb House and the Harvard Faculty Club.
The lawsuit, filed last September, centers on a surcharge of around 18 to 22 percent added to all food and beverage bills at Loeb House and the Faculty Club. Harvard uses the extra revenue for operating expenses instead of giving it to the wait staff, a practice that the complaint alleges violates the Massachusetts “Tip Law.”
The law states that service employees must be the sole recipients of “a fee that a patron or other consumer would reasonably expect to be given to wait staff employees.”
“If you want to add a charge to the bill and not pay it to the wait staff, you just have to let the consumer know,” said Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, an attorney for the workers.
Harvard argued that because the wait staff is unionized–they are members of UNITE HERE! Local 26–its relationship with the University is governed by federal collective bargaining laws and thus the case should be tried in a federal court.
Regardless, Harvard asserts that the surcharge is explicitly not a tip or gratuity covered under the tip law.
“The Faculty Club included a surcharge, not a tip or gratuity or service charge, which was used to defray the expenses of the Faculty Club,” wrote a University spokesperson in an email to The Crimson.
Harvard also asserts that the wages and benefits it provides to the wait staff are highly competitive.
“Faculty Club employees are paid more than double the average wage for restaurant industry workers and receive benefits that include health care, access to child care, four weeks paid vacation and tuition assistance,” the spokesperson wrote.
The lawsuit will now return to the state court to be tried under state law.
Liss-Riordan said she is confident that the case is clear enough that it will be settled out of court before coming to trial. This was the case in a similar suit she filed against the Harvard Club of Boston.
“The [state] law is just strikingly clear on this point,” she said.
She said that as an alumna of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, she was especially disappointed that in her assessment Harvard does not follow the tip law.
“But now I’m hopeful that Harvard will do the right thing, recognize they made a mistake, pay back the wait staff, and move forward,” she said.

MIT leaders, including President L. Rafael Reif, crowded into City Hall on Monday night to lobby the Council to support their plans for the university’s development in Kendall Square.
In December, MIT submitted a petition to change zoning ordinances in Kendall Square to allow for the development of 26-acres of the university’s property. MIT plans to transform four parking lots into lab, office, housing, and research space.
“Together, we can create the world’s liveliest innovation district,” Raif told the Council. Much of the new complex would be devoted to innovation and entrepreneurship, he said.
MIT had originally petitioned for rezoning in Kendall Square in 2010, but failed to win the support of the Council. Councilors had said that MIT’s proposals lacked detail, and that MIT needed to include more affordable housing units in the plan.
The second proposal, submitted to the Council last December, includes new concessions to the broader Cambridge community, including a $10 million community benefits program and a $4 million provision for the city’s Affordable Housing Trust. The Council needs to vote on this ordinance before the petition expires on April 15.
Council members praised the MIT leadership for their presence at the meeting.
“I just wanted to recognize the President being here was a monumental shift from the last time around,” said Councilor Leland Cheung at Monday’s meeting.
Praising MIT leadership for appearing before the Council, Councilor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 noted that, in recent years, senior Harvard administrators have chosen not to testify on their development plans before the Council.
“At Harvard they’ve tended to think that someone from community relations can go over to the Council,” said Reeves. “But it did not prove enough.”
During the meeting, several Cambridge residents protested the Kendall Square development plans on the grounds of noise pollution.
“I would like to suggest that we not trade quality of life for prosperity,” said Jo M. Solet, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School.
“We are poised to put so much noise-making stuff all over this city,” said Heather M. Hoffman, a Cambridge resident. “The people who live in these housing units won’t be able to hear themselves think.”
The Councilors agreed on the need to develop mechanisms for enforcing the City’s noise ordinances. Although they expressed support for the MIT’s development plans, they also referred the matter of the noise ordinance to the Cambridge Environment Committee for further investigation.

Members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force and other Allston residents criticized Harvard for what they called a failure to include sufficient benefits for the surrounding neighborhood in their development plans for Barry’s Corner at a meeting on Monday evening.
Around 65 people—including North Allston residents, Harvard communications staff, municipal authorities, and representatives of the firm charged with developing Barry’s Corner, Samuels & Associates—discussed parking and transportation plans for the site before turning to the question of its associated community benefits.
The Barry’s Corner development, which will include 325 residential units and 45,000 square feet of retail space and residential amenities, was originally scheduled to go before the Boston Redevelopment Authority in mid-March, but that date was pushed back to April 11 as the task force and Harvard struggled to agree on conditions for the University to move some of its campus services to 28 Travis St.
Leslie G. Cohen, senior vice president for development at Samuels & Associates, began the meeting with a PowerPoint presentation addressing previous concerns about how plans for the Barry’s Corner complex would accommodate increased traffic without burdening the surrounding neighborhood.
While some Allston residents expressed anxiety over the ratio of parking spaces to residents, Cohen said that the complex’s underground garage would be sufficient to satisfy residents’ parking needs without overflowing into the surrounding neighborhood.
The latter half of Monday’s meeting focused on the perceived lack of community benefits attached to the Barry’s Corner project. Some members of the task force argued that some benefits should be tied specifically to the Barry’s Corner project, instead of only to Harvard’s plans for Allston more broadly.
“There ought to be a community benefit package from this [project], and there ought to be for every building.” task force member Bruce E. Houghton said.
BRA Senior Project Manager Gerald Autler explained that Harvard would be asked to deliver community benefits that corresponds to its overall development in Allston.
“Our whole approach has been to get away from negotiating building-by-building,” Autler said.
Still, several task force members said that they were unsatisfied with leaving those benefits undetermined.
“[Barry’s Corner] is going to rise out of the Earth, and we’re going to have nothing to show for it,” task force chair and Allston resident Ray V. Mellone said.
After some discussion, task force members rallied around the idea of tying improvements of Smith Field, a park adjacent to the site of the planned development, to the development of Barry’s Corner.
BRA Chief Planner Kairos Shen said that the agency would explore language that could require a commitment from Harvard to renovate the field in order to receive BRA approval for the Barry’s Corner development. Shen and task force members agreed to try to come up with a provision by the time the project faces evaluation from the BRA.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day before a proposed five-point honor code was expected to be unveiled at the Tuesday faculty meeting, students generally welcomed the prospect of an honor code, but cautioned that such a policy may not succeed unless there is a shift in the community’s attitude toward academic integrity.
The proposed honor code, prepared by the Committee on Academic Integrity and laid out in a report obtained by The Crimson late Sunday night, comes in the wake of Harvard’s largest cheating scandal in recent memory. The proposal would institute a Student/Faculty Judicial Board populated by both students and faculty to hear exclusively cases of academic dishonesty. Among other points, the proposal calls for students to write a “declaration of integrity” on assignments, final exams, and projects as part of an effort to build a “culture of trust” on campus.
Sebastian M. Chiu ’13, a Statistics 104 teaching fellow, said that before an honor code can succeed, “you have to reach a point where academic integrity is valued and shared in the community.”
“I feel like in order to be really effective with an honor code, you need to have a sort of culture shift on campus,” Chiu said.
While voicing support of the proposals, other students echoed the sentiment that an honor code must be accompanied by student support in order to change the climate of integrity at Harvard.
Tara Raghuveer ’14, president of the Undergraduate Council, said she believes the honor code is “a good starting point to have continued discussions about academic integrity and about what the culture looks like on campus.”
“Something like the honor code really doesn’t hold any weight without any buy-in from the student body,” Raghuveer said. The proposed student-populated board, she said, would be key to creating that buy-in among undergraduates.
Another student, Mariana Gudino Castanon ’14, expressed mixed feelings about the five-point proposal. Gudino Castanon said she thinks the introduction of an honor code might encourage students to discuss issues of academic integrity more openly than they do now. She also expressed support of the proposal that would give students a voice in hearing academic dishonesty cases, but said she was not sure that simply signing a statement when turning in assignments would necessarily change much.
What would be most effective in promoting academic integrity, according to Hillary B. Singer ’14, is a clear definition from the administration about what constitutes cheating. Singer, drawing on her experiences as an Applied Math teaching fellow, added that it was essential that the administration’s policies reflect differences in the ways that different departments structure assignments.
“I think there ought to be a very clearly defined, explicitly written policy about what constitutes cheating and what academic integrity is,” Singer said.
The Committee on Academic Integrity first began discussing Harvard’s honesty policies in fall 2010, but its work took on new significance for many this academic year after 125 academic dishonesty cases in Government 1310 sparked a scandal that generated international attention.
Going forward, the Committee on Academic Integrity is looking to solicit student feedback about the proposal. Terah E. Lyons ’14 and Samuel F. Himel ’13, committee members who have been leading the student effort to help draft proposals for the student-populated disciplinary board and the integrity statement, said the timeline for finalizing the honor code is not definite.
Himel said the committee plans to solicit feedback through the UC, in the Houses, and among student groups.
“This is the beginning of a conversation, and now we’re going to draw literally thousands of voices into it,” Lyons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 3, 2013, at 3:03 a.m.
Contradicting a previous statement, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds told faculty at their monthly meeting Tuesday that she authorized a second round of secret email searches that probed the faculty and administrative accounts of a single resident dean identified as having leaked confidential information about the Government 1310 cheating case.
The second search, which came soon after administrators searched the email accounts of 16 resident deans in September, directly violates the Faculty of Arts and Sciences faculty email privacy policy, which requires the approval of the FAS Dean and the University Office of the General Counsel for any email search. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said Tuesday that he was not made aware of the second search until March.
On March 11, Smith and Hammonds released a statement which said the searches were “limited to the Administrative accounts for the Resident Deans...as distinct from their individual Harvard email accounts.”
But on Tuesday, Hammonds doubled back on that as she read prepared remarks to a packed room of faculty in University Hall.
“Although I consulted with legal counsel, I did not inform Dean Smith about the two additional queries. This was a mistake. I also regret the inaccuracies in our March 11 communication resulting from my failure to recollect the additional searches at the time of that communication,” Hammonds said.
The disclosure came amidst apologies from top administrators at Tuesday’s faculty meeting, which was the first since news of the searches of the resident deans’ accounts broke in early March. The meeting was expected to primarily focus on an honor code proposal, but ultimately became more of a back and forth between administrators offering explanations and faculty looking to reconcile what many have called a breach of trust.
Speaking in turn at the start of the 90-minute meeting, University President Drew G. Faust, Smith, and Hammonds all acknowledged that the searches had been mishandled. Speaking in somber tones, Smith and Hammonds took full responsibility for the way the investigation was conducted.
“I am left with the undeniable conclusion that, in this case, notification was not done as it should have been,” Smith said in a prepared statement. “I met with members of the Administrative Board, whose membership includes all of the resident deans, and I apologized to them for the mistake. Since I am ultimately responsible for how our policies are applied to the members of our community, I make the same apology to the faculty.”
There are two email privacy policies regarding FAS email accounts, with one covering staff and the other covering faculty. Resident deans, who serve as both administrators and members of the faculty, have both accounts. Only administrative accounts were probed in the first round of searches, thus avoiding a direct violation of the faculty privacy policy.
But in the second set of searches, administrators specifically queried the administrative and faculty accounts of the resident dean in question for emails from the Crimson reporters covering the cheating case. The probe also included a subject-line search of the faculty account of the dean in question, similar to the one first executed on the deans’ administrative accounts.
In their March 11 statement, Smith and Hammonds had said that the resident dean identified by the first search was made aware that the search had occurred shortly after it happened. Whether or not that dean was aware of the second round of searches in advance of their execution was not addressed at Tuesday’s faculty meeting. FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment Tuesday evening on when the dean was notified of the second search.
Faust, who previously said she was not made aware of the searches when they happened, told faculty that she commissioned her own study of email privacy at Harvard after the searches became public. She said she determined that Harvard has “never monitored faculty email, and that only rarely does the University access faculty email,” but declined to answer questions from faculty asking her to clarify what she meant by “rarely.”
In her remarks, Faust also offered a frank assessment of Harvard’s existing email privacy policies. The lack of consistent policies across the University, she said, “constitutes a significant institutional failure to provide adequate guidance and direction in a digital environment.”
Faust said she has enlisted the help of Boston lawyer Michael Keating to verify the accuracy of the information about the searches presented on Tuesday. She also announced the creation of a new faculty task force chaired by Law School professor David J. Barron, a former Crimson president, to develop recommendations for a broad new email privacy policy by the end of the Fall 2013 term.
“We must never again have a situation like the one that concerns us today,” she concluded.
Though they were quick to accept administrators’ apologies, faculty members who spoke up at the meeting said reconciliation between the two groups would not be that easy.
“It seems to me that trust has to be based on something,” said classics professor Richard F. Thomas, a member of the Faculty Council. “The request that you make that we have trust suggests there aren’t consequences from this past case that go beyond saying simply, ‘Let’s all talk and get along together.’”
Pointing to faculty’s hesitance in the meeting to address the issue, a number of professors said the case illustrates a larger communication problem between faculty and increasingly distant administrators.
“As the size of the administration has grown over the past 10 to 15 years... it has inevitably produced a sense of unhelpful distance between the administrative decision-making process and the faculty who are affected by it,” said History of Art and Architecture professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger, a member of the Faculty Council. He likened the experience of trying to speak with administrators about certain issues to “waiting to get an audience with Louis XIV in Versailles.”
History professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96, the faculty’s docket committee chair, said she feels a new, less formal form of communication is needed to ease the existing strain between faculty and their administrators.
Fellow history professor Lisa M. McGirr echoed Jasanoff, suggesting that a docketed discussion about faculty governance be proposed for the May faculty meeting. She characterized the email searches as one of several recent top-down decisions that have created a “gap between the administration and faculty over our sense of our rights and responsibilities.”
For their part, administrators pledged to open new avenues of communication for faculty in the near term and consider longer-term proposals about how they might better communicate.
Because nearly 50 minutes had elapsed before Faust could guide the meeting back to its scheduled agenda, discussion of three docketed items, including an honor code proposal, was limited. Smith’s presentation on proceedings for revising policies on faculty work outside of the University drew no comments. Faculty members who voiced concern over the honor code proposal and another proposal to alter the structure of reading and exam periods focused primarily on issues of trust and communication raised earlier in the meeting.
Responding to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris’s honor code presentation, mathematics professor Wilfried Schmid raised concern over whether or not specific conditions at Harvard had contributed to the Government 1310 cheating case and a general breakdown in academic integrity. He suggested that flawed teaching in Government 1310 and more general attitudes by faculty and administrators could have as large an effect on academic integrity as student attitudes.
“Yes, now students will be asked to sign an academic integrity pledge, but how about us? How about us as faculty?” he said.

CLARIFICATION: April 2, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that Boston lawyer Michael Keating will help produce a report on past email searches and surveillance at Harvard. To clarify, Keating will work to verify the accuracy of the information about the searches presented on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sam O’Connor ’12 and Malcolm Howard ’05 helped the Harvard crew team win many a race during their time in Cambridge, but on Sunday they helped their team win The Boat Race.
The Crimson alums led the Oxford team to a victory over Cambridge in the annual Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race, which is known as The Boat Race in Britain. The race, which attracted thousands to the banks of the River Thames and millions more on television, is one of the most celebrated and historic sporting events in England. O’Connor and Howard helped give Oxford its 77th victory in the 159-year history of the race.
Howard, who took home an Olympic gold medal in 2008 in men’s eights and silver in the same event in 2012, rowed stroke for Oxford, while O’Connor was in the fourth seat. The team completed the 6.8-kilometer course in 17:27 for a length-and-a-half victory over the rival Cambridge squad.
O’Connor, whose younger brother James is the captain of the Harvard heavyweights, became just the 10th New Zealander to race in the event.
The two were not the only Harvard connection to the event, though. Ben French ’11 rowed in Oxford’s Reserve Boat, and his boat took home victory by a third-of-a-length over Cambridge in their division.
The three rowers are all studying for their graduate degrees at Oxford.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team has watched a new offensive star emerge this week, seemingly out of nowhere. Murphy Vandervelde, a sophomore midfielder who until last week had not scored in his collegiate career, has scored seven goals in the Crimson’s last three games.
“It’s great to see Murphy break out in terms of his goal scoring,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik '96 said. “He has a great shot and great fundamentals, and he’s been really working hard to earn his opportunities.”
Vandervelde scored his first goal at Dartmouth on Mar. 23.
“I came in off the midline, [freshman midfielder] Brendan Newman threw me the ball, and I just stepped in and had a 12 to 13-yard step down shot that beat the goalie to the bottom-left corner of the cage,” Vandervelde said. “It was surreal.”
“It took longer for me than most people to get my first collegiate goal,” he added. “But it worked out in the end.”
The Crimson went on to beat Dartmouth, 9-6. With the added confidence that accompanies breaking onto the scorecard for the first time, Vandervelde entered the Albany game on Tuesday looking to find the net again. He delivered with his first career hat trick.
Early in the first period, the sharpshooter caught the ball off a pass from senior Jack Walker, spun to the outside and shot side-armed past the goalkeeper for his second goal of the season.
Vandervelde followed that in the second quarter with another score. The sophomore received the ball in his sweet spot on the left side of the offensive set during a Harvard man-up opportunity before burying it in the cage.
“I feel most comfortable shooting from the two corners, about 13 yards out, on the football hash,” Vandervelde said. “That’s where [freshman attack] Devin Dwyer, who is such a great feeder, always looks off my guy before getting me the ball for my shot.”
Vandervelde got the ball in his spot again, man-up, with 10:52 remaining in the game, and fired a laser into the back of the cage, securing his first hat trick. It was one of the few bright moments that night for the Crimson, which fell to the Great Danes, 16-7.
“I would rather a win with no hat trick and no goals at all than to lose like that,” said Vandervelde after the Albany game. “Looking forward, we’ve got Duke on Saturday and we’re going to really stick it to them.”
The midfielder nearly made good on his promise, leading his team against the No. 10 Blue Devils with another three goals.
Down 7-6 with 3:15 remaining in the third quarter, the Crimson got the ball, man-up, after a Duke slashing penalty. Vandervelde caught a pass nineteen seconds later and fired, but was rejected by Duke sophomore goaltender Kyle Turri.
Yet Vandervelde refused to let that shake him.
Harvard picked up the ground ball off the rebound and swung it around the cage to Dwyer. The freshman then passed the ball through the Blue Devil defense to an open Vandervelde on the left hash. Refusing to be denied twice, the midfielder leveled the score at 7-7.
The Crimson then entered the fourth quarter man-up, and it took only 18 seconds for Vandervelde to get the ball on the left hash and find the bottom-left corner of the net for his second tally of the game, giving Harvard the lead.
Duke evened the score, but committed another penalty with 8:31 remaining in the contest.
The entire crowd knew what was coming next.
The Crimson passed the ball around the back of the goal to Dwyer, who got it to Vandervelde about 15 yards from the goal on the right hash.
“The third shot was my most ambitious of the day,” Vandervelde said. “It was one of those that would either work out or would get me chewed out. But there was no doubt in my mind that I would shoot that ball.”
“I was feeling it,” Vandervelde added. “I just aimed for the top-left corner and it went in.”
Vandervelde’s second hat trick in that many games gave Harvard a 9-8 lead, but the Crimson eventually lost its second straight contest, 12-11.
Five of the sophomore’s seven goals have come while the team had an extra man.
In Harvard’s first six games of the season, the team’s man-up unit converted on 23.8 percent of its opportunities. Since Vandervelde joined the unit at Dartmouth, the Crimson has had a 58.3 percent success rate.
“He’s definitely earned more playing time,” Wojcik said. “He’ll be in the rotation more on offense going forward into the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sailing saw action in three regattas over the weekend. The A team traveled to Roger Williams to compete in the Ted Ferrarone Team Race, while the B team set sail at Tufts in the Mystic Lake Team Race Invitational. Meanwhile, the women’s squad participated in the Dellenbaugh Women’s Trophy at Brown.
TED FERRARONE TEAM RACE
The A team performed out of its skin for the Crimson, winning 17 of the 18 races—five more than the number of victories of second place Vermont Catamounts.
“We’ve definitely been getting better at team racing but we definitely weren’t expecting to do as well as we did,” sophomore skipper Gram Slattery said. “No one could have expected to win 17 out of 18 races. I mean everything was on today.”
After a disappointing season thus far compared to usual standards, the hard training that Harvard put in over spring break seems to have paid off.
“There was a lot of really good communication between all three boats,” Slattery said. “All the plays we had on paper we were able to execute well.”
The Crimson was out of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association rankings going into the weekend but still managed to snag an honorable mention. While the ICSA predicted that “in one year [Harvard] will move from spoiler to force,” the squad of one junior, four sophomores, and one freshman appears to be a year ahead of schedule based on the results of this weekend.
“It’s no secret that [the team] hasn’t been as strong as it has been in years past,” Slattery said. “But we’ve been progressively getting better through the fall and through the spring and so I think [the win] marks a stepping stone to an upward trend.”
DELLENBAUGH WOMEN’S TROPHY
The women were unable to replicate the success of the A team, finishing sixth in the Dellenbaugh Women’s Trophy against an extremely competitive field. All of the five teams that beat the Crimson were in the top 11 of the ICSA rankings before the regatta, providing an opportunity for Harvard to test itself against the best of opposition.
“This was a tough regatta,” junior captain Isabel Ruane said. “This is probably the toughest [group of] fleets we will face until nationals, maybe. It was an intersectional regatta so there were teams from every part of the country, and most teams sent their A game. So we were pleased that we could hang and compete and do well with a competitive group.”
The weather conditions were reasonable on Saturday but got tough on Sunday as the wind picked up. Nonetheless, the B division was able to pull out an effort worthy of garnering 93 points over the weekend.
“We did well [on Saturday], it was medium air,” Ruane said. “We could handle [it] well. [Sunday] was tougher because it was really windy. We don’t sail in heavy breeze often but we were pleased that we could keep up. Especially our B division of Caitlin Watson and Kristina Jakobson, pulled off some really good races in the heavy winds, so they were really pleased that they could do well and we were really proud of them.”
This is the type of performance the team will look to capitalize and improve on in the upcoming weeks, according to Ruane.
“We’re very pleased with the sixth position,” Ruane said. “We know it’s a keeper, and we’re looking forward to having more finishes like that—[those are] the kinds of finishes we want.”
MYSTIC LAKE TEAM RACE INVITATIONAL
At Tufts, the B team competed in a tough regatta. Against many of the top crews in the nation, the Crimson finished seventh out of the eight teams.
Harvard knew it was up against some of the best boats around who had brought their A teams no less, and thus the team went into the weekend with an open mind.
“There wasn’t big pressure on the team,” freshman Marek Zaleski said. “Our goal was simply to learn.”
“We have a relatively inexperienced squad when it comes to team racing,” Zaleski added. “So we didn’t perform that well but we did the best that we could and we lived up to expectations."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After five consecutive Vanderbilt goals in the first period, the Harvard women’s lacrosse squad had a large scoring gap to close for the remainder of the match.
The Crimson battled to decrease the deficit, with its first look at a comeback coming in the final 30 seconds of the first period when two senior midfielders, Danielle Tetreault and captain Micaela Cyr, each pocketed a goal to bring the score to 10-4 at the half.
The Crimson (2-7, 1-2 Ivy) faced off against the Commodores (2-12, 0-3 ALC) Monday in Nashville, with the match initially appearing to be a close one. Although Vanderbilt tallied a point in only the second minute, Harvard quickly answered with a goal from Cyr after the captain was fed the ball from freshman attack Alexis Nicolia.
The Crimson failed to register another point until the 17th minute when freshman Audrey Todd netted a goal, closing the Crimson deficit to four. Todd would also go on to register a hat trick.
The Commodores pulled away again, scoring three goals in four minutes and then a fourth point with two minutes remaining in the half. All four goals came from four different Vanderbilt players.
Todd and Cyr opened the second half the same way they ended the first, with each scoring a quick unassisted goal within three minutes to bring their team back within four. Nearly 15 minutes after the opening two goals, Vanderbilt responded with a score of its own.
For the remainder of the match, Harvard and the Commodores alternated scoring, each team coming up with five goals in the final 14 minutes. Junior midfielder Kyleigh Keating found the back of the net to bring the score to 11-7, but a man-up situation in Vanderbilt’s favor widened the scoring gap yet again.
The final four Crimson goals came from senior midfielder Nina Kucharczyk, Nicolia, Todd, and Tetreault. Although Harvard outscored the Commodores by two goals during that time span, the rally was not enough to overtake Vanderbilt as the Crimson ultimately fell, 15-11.
Three was the reoccurring number for Harvard during the match. Todd and Cyr led the Crimson with three goals apiece, while Tetreault tallied three points with a goal and two assists. Freshman midfielder Isabella Wager picked up a team-high of three ground balls.
Harvard coach Lisa Miller and members of the team could not be reached for comment Monday evening.

THE CHALLENGE: Go vegan for a week (Monday-Friday only—denying ourselves Annenberg brunch was not an option)
HOW THEY FARED:
EMMA
My parents read our last column as a cry for help. When they came up for a visit last Sunday, they brought along two dozen New York bagels. This proved to be a godsend—pieces torn off of these constituted close to half of my diet over the course of the week. Veganism is all about greens, but I have to admit I ate a lot of beige.
 
Monday: My first meal as a vegan (Annenberg breakfast) introduced me to my first vegan irony. The card pinned up above the pancake syrup proudly declared: vegan. But pancakes? Not so much. I settled for some Apple Zings with soymilk. But a tightening sensation in my throat quickly confirmed that I had not, in fact, conquered my bothersome soymilk allergy (I want to make clear, as a tofu lover, that I am allergic to soymilk, not soy: apparently when soy is cooked, it kills whatever enzyme in soy my body finds objectionable). Half a bagel from my bag-o-bread sufficed for lunch. For dinner I paid a visit to OSUSHI. Despite my dinner companions' assertions to the contrary, I was quite satisfied with the vegetable roll, thank you very much! So satisfied, in fact, that when I started to feel hungry again at around midnight, I picked up a seaweed and cucumber roll at the 24-hour market. Restaurant quality? Very nearly! While I paid, my friend waited for the three Boar's Head sandwiches our study buddies had requested. I averted my eyes.
 
Tuesday: Another day, another vegan irony. I was pretty excited when a mid-lecture peek at the HUDS website informed me that there would be falafels at lunch. But the label affixed to the tahini dressing I'd hoped to drown my pita in delivered a disappointing revelation: Tahini Dressing—Vegetarian. By the time I learned that this was probably a mistake, I'd long since consumed my distinctly dry falafel sandwich. A Chipotle rice bowl for dinner lifted my spirits. But finding myself hungry late at night, once again, I capped off my second day of veganism with a feast of grapes and granola.
 
Wednesday: Faced with the prospect of yet another black Americano, I convinced myself that I wasn't so allergic to soymilk. Bad call. I spent the two hours after class I'd budgeted for homework feeling far too nauseous to ponder the vagaries of semantic shifts. Later, at Café Pamplona, I sat (appropriately) green with envy as my friends sampled beef empanadas and flan. I sought comfort with the half a container of granola I had stowed away in Grays.
 
Thursday: Vaguely repulsed by the notion of yet another bowl of assorted vegan cereals (no Marshmallow Mateys, no Cracklin' Oat Bran, no Honey Nut Scooters), I sampled all the different kinds of bread Annenberg has to offer. The marble slice disappointed, but the raisin bread delivered. For my second HUDS meal of the day, I put together a salad that incorporated close to 100 percent of the salad bar offerings. Later, I met real-life vegan (and Crimson Editorial Chair) Marina Bolotnikova for coffee at everyone's favorite "food lab," Clover. Marina became a vegetarian in middle school, and decided to go vegan around the beginning of high school as she learned more about what she calls "animal agriculture." Marina is extremely passionate about veganism, and believes it to be "the way of the future."
 
Friday: I preceded back-to-back midterms with a super-long breakfast. A vegan-cereal aficionado by this point, I piled Apple Zings, Corn Pops, and Raisin Bran into a bowl without so much as a backward glance at the HUDS labels. I skipped lunch, but by the time I headed to a celebratory Last Vegan Supper at Veggie Planet, I'd polished off all of the granola in a container large enough to be labeled a tub. The roasted vegetables and rice platter I ordered at Veggie Planet were delicious, but I made sure to save room. Within fifteen minutes of midnight I was sinking my teeth into a Tasty Burger (pickles, onions, tomatoes, mustard, ketchup, hold the cheese).
 
CONNIE
 
The last time I tried going vegetarian, I held out for all of an hour. Blame my environment; in Texas, eating meat is just short of mandatory. In the summer, I would have the trifecta; pork for breakfast, chicken for lunch, and beef for dinner. So when Emma suggested that we try going vegan for a week, I nearly had a heart attack. And no, not because my arteries were clogged.
 
Monday: I woke up feeling refreshed and eager to try something new for the week. However, instead of trying  to be creative with my limited options in the dining hall, I opted for a trustworthy system I developed to rely on whenever I was unsure if something qualified as vegan or not: when in doubt, have a peanut butter sandwich. I then survived the first day of the vegan challenge by eating only peanut butter sandwiches, just to play it safe.
 
Tuesday: I must admit; Tuesday was my downfall. After facing the prospect of tackling both an Expos paper and studying for an economics midterm in one night, I turned to the only source of comfort I knew: pizza. It was over before I knew it; the joy I felt as I feverishly wolfed down three slices of gooey Domino's pizza was only fleeting compared to the immediate guilt I felt for betraying my promise to Emma (I eventually confessed and she took it in stride. God bless Emma Adler.) At least I held out for longer than an hour this time.
 
Wednesday: I had skipped breakfast and lunch to cram for my test before I headed to Annenberg to enjoy a nice salad. However, as I attempted to pour ranch dressing onto my salad, my friend swatted my hand away and told me that ranch was in fact not vegan and had buttermilk. Feeling sheepish (and very hungry), I spent dinner that night eating a banana and watching my friend drown her bowl in my favorite dressing.
 
Thursday: Lunch marked the twentieth time I Googled, "Is __ vegan?" before eating a particular item, which in this case was French fries. Obviously, unless they were fried in animal fats or oils, I was safe. I decided to give the delicious golden potato wedges the benefit of the doubt since I had been eating the same things for the past four days and wanted some more color on my palate. Luckily, my indulgence ended up causing no harm as the HUDS website, which I checked later that night, confirmed that the fries were indeed vegan. I also wish I had consulted the HUDS website more often during the week since it conveniently lists "VGN" next to all the vegan options on the menu for the day. Maybe then I wouldn’t have gotten tired of eating peanut butter, which is something I never imagined could actually happen. I grew up eating PB&J sandwiches everyday, but I guess there is always a breaking point.
 
Friday: In the midst of midterms and a cold that just never seemed to leave my body, going vegan for a week was probably not the best choice. I finished the challenge with none other than a perfectly crafted peanut butter sandwich and a milk-less bowl of Cinnamon Toasters. I must admit that I drooled a little more than necessary before indulging in some late-night Cheez-Its as soon as the clock struck midnight.
 
THE VERDICT: 
We could understand the appeal of a plant-based diet: there's no denying that going vegan forces you to cut out a lot of unhealthy foods. Unless we were just imagining it all in our heads, our pants seemed to fit a bit looser on us. We also admired and appreciated the environmental and moral implications of going vegan. Trying something new for a week was fun and fulfilling for the both of us. However, we probably won't be continuing this diet in the long run. We are, after all, foodies at heart, and we simply missed our favorite dishes too much.

It's pretty clear that if the College Events Board cancels Tyga as this year's Yardfest performer, the chances of finding a suitable and affordable replacement for the rapper between now and April 15 are slim to none.
But fear not! Flyby's come up with a list of some celebs who maybe, if we asked nicely enough, just might agree to come yell slurs at Harvard students on a Saturday afternoon in the near future.
Unknown
 If the troubadour featured in this gem of a music video would please step up, we might just have ourselves a Yardfest artist few Harvard students could reasonably take issue with.
The Soundtrack to "Love Story in Harvard"
 Apparently there was this show in Korea about two Harvard Law School students who fall in love with a Harvard Medical School student and proceed to fight over her. The theme song is pretty catchy, no? If all else fails, the CEB could just blast this soundtrack over loudspeakers in the Yard while we all cry over our absent love lives/how bad the songs are.
Glozell and Jenna Marbles — Sure, they're not technically musicians, but the comedians did show oodles of Harvard pride in "Rewind YouTube Style" last December. And they're funny! Call us maybe?
Tyra Banks — Again, not a "real" musician (is Tyga?), but that hasn't stopped Tyra in the past (see: Life Size's "Be a Star").
Reasons this would be a win-win:
1) A Tyra performance would be perfect for those nine students who have already made their Tyga fan signs, and for the CEB which—let's be real—has definitely already made Tyga t-shirts. This way, they could change the "g" to an "r," or just do nothing and pretend they made an embarrassing typo (and not an embarrassingly bad judgment call on Harvard students' music taste and social consciousness.)
2) Tyra LOVES any opportunity to come back to Harvard, the school she "graduated" from in 2012.
If we hashtag it #HBSReunion, she will come.
