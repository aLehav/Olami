After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was June 21. A Sunday. A strange news day, my bureau chief had warned. And he was right, of course.
It began as just another news day, it was the day I learned that time-worn folktale, that D.C. is built on a swamp. The air was damp and moist and the sky went from clear to plump—thick and opaque nimbus clouds stretched their wispy fingertips and grazed me with soft pokes and prods in what seemed like a matter of minutes.
I was tired.
I was walking the two miles from American University to a local cat café. This was the cat café’s second day, and the line outside showed it.
I was supposed to meet the owner. I was supposed to have arrived at 9:00 a.m., 15 minutes earlier, for our scheduled interview. I was supposed to wait in line, probably. I didn’t. There were frowns, I remember. And a few clucking tongues.
By the time I successfully sidestepped the growing swarm of customers, I’d found the 24-year-old entrepreneur I’d been looking for. And after we embraced I saw that her shirt announced “The Time Is Meow.” She saw me grin and said, “how funny. Because you’re with TIME Magazine.” I learned that she was previously an investment banker whose gap year had entailed the realization that making money could be fulfilling, too.
She had a small lisp, which made it difficult to hear her clearly. We reached a compromise, which made me, effectively, her shadow: I observed—loitered, lingered, this time, at the side.
I watched her at once pet a one-eyed cat and reward a customer with a plush pillow stitched, in flowery print, with the phrase “Le Chat.” I felt out of place that Sunday. Out of place because I was occupying someone else’s space and crossing the not so visible line between the world within my head and the sometimes disappointing one outside my flesh.
I felt out of place mostly, though, because of what I heard in this place.
It was all so intimate.
I picked apart conversations I overheard as if the words were spools of yarn.
I met a couple in front of me who held a battered menu and spoke loudly about their least favorite beverage category, “Cat Colada.” “Doesn’t even rhyme with piña.”
I met a girl experimenting with her sexuality whose red basketball shorts stretched past her knees towards her mud-streaked Jordan’s. “Felines remind me of femininity.”
I met another café owner, located just across the street, who “majored in Mediterranean food and minored in revolutions”. He was dressed in a UPS uniform that was grease-stained at the sleeve, and smoked close to ten cigarettes in between congested heaves. “My mother used to hand feed strays in Iran.”
She was killed by a bomb in 1979.
I met strangers whose names and faces I forgot by the day’s end, but whose stories loitered and lingered in my memory. “Is proof a prerequisite for existence?”
I hope not.
I asked so many questions that Sunday, questions whose answers I learned were placeholders at best. Questions that couldn’t be answered, or didn’t need to be answered, because what mattered most was that they were being answered at all.
I met so many strangers and heard so many stories, and I suppose I should have expected this. I was, after all, working a journalism internship.
But I certainly didn’t expect how willing these strangers would be to let me become privy into what I can only assume were otherwise undisclosed admissions of vulnerability.
I didn’t expect, either, how hard it would be. To not include these stories into the story that appeared in print. The one with the tight nutgraf. And interspersed quotes. And an overarching theme.
I didn’t expect to want to read and write these stories more. The ones on the periphery. The ones that loiter and linger. The ones that overlap and interact and sustain the plot of another story.
The one about the investment banker who, feeling unfulfilled, opened up a strange place filled with strange cats and even stranger news.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all the things we conservatives are known for, I can at least have pride that our intellectual tradition is associated with the rule of law, by which I mean the belief that a state should be governed by law and not the caprice of government officials, no matter how benign or wise. As sectarian violence is making large swathes of the Middle East ungovernable and political corruption around the world has turned law in some countries notional at best, we clearly see the detritus that unchecked human activity leads to. In other words, the rule of law is important, perhaps more so now than ever.
That is why I watched the unfolding debate around Kim Davis—the county clerk in Kentucky who, claiming a religious objection, refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples—with great interest. Citing her refusal to enforce the law, a federal judge ordered her to jail (she has since been released). A great debate emerged. Some on the right, like presidential candidates Governor Mike Huckabee and Senator Ted Cruz JD ’95, argued that this was a first amendment religious liberty debate, and that Davis should have never been imprisoned. However, perhaps surprisingly, others on the right made common cause with those on the left by arguing that the question was simply a matter of the rule of law: as a government employee, Davis had no choice but to comply with the state’s marriage policy. However unfortunate it might be that her job forced her to violate her conscience, her choices were either to enforce the law or resign.
Running the risk of ignoring some nuances, I think this argument makes sense, and should appeal to many conservatives. Kim Davis qua a government employee should have obeyed the law. Instead of arguing that Davis did nothing wrong, we conservatives should focus our energy on articulating why forcing people to make the choice between their job and their religious beliefs is profoundly un-American. Such a choice is as tragic as it is avoidable. States should follow North Carolina’s example and create protections for employees claiming religious exemptions, and Congress should pass Utah Senator Mike Lee’s First Amendment Defense Act.
But this column is not about religious freedom, nor is it (mainly) about Kim Davis. It is about the rule of law and how many on the left have used it inconsistently in their arguments against conservatives. Over the past few years, President Obama and some of his allies have done things remarkably similar to Davis: where she forsook the rule of law for faith, they did so for ideology. And while one might be able to convincingly argue that, in virtue of some reason other than the rule of law, their actions were justified whereas Davis’ were not, the burden to provide that argument rests on their shoulders.
A few examples:
Immigration. Congress notably failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform in 2013. Before that they refused to pass the Obama-backed DREAM Act. In response to these legislative setbacks, Obama decided to act unilaterally. On June 15, 2012 Obama announced that the United States would no longer deport illegal aliens who matched the criteria outlined in the DREAM Act, effectively enacting the law that Congress rejected.
And on November 20, 2014 Obama announced that he would defer the deportations of millions of illegal aliens. The action was almost immediately challenged by Texas, with twenty-five other states eventually signing on to the lawsuit. Federal District Judge Andrew Hanen not only placed an injunction on the deferments, but also ordered Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and other federal government officials to appear before him and explain why they seemingly failed to comply with his injunction. Hanen went so far as to characterize the government’s attitude towards it as “cavalier”.
While the president’s DREAM executive order may not be technically illegal, prosecutorial discretion and the current appeal to Judge Hanen’s injunction taken together are actions typifying a pattern of disregard for the rule of law. Their clear intent and effect were to undermine the duly passed and standing laws of Congress and supplant existing immigration policy with Obama’s. To rewrite America’s immigration laws by executive fiat is to turn congressional approval into a sufficient, rather than a necessary, condition for lawmaking, and concomitantly to weaken the rule of law.
Marijuana. Here in Massachusetts, medical marijuana is legal and non-medical marijuana is decriminalized. This is more or less the case in twenty-three other states;  in four (and the District of Columbia) recreational marijuana is legal, and in twenty medical marijuana is legal.
While one can debate the merits of these policies—whether the current laws disadvantage minorities, whether taxing marijuana could bring in substantial revenue, whether the drug is dangerous or not—they are in violation of federal law, which has not changed to accommodate those more permissive states. Indeed, the Drug Enforcement Administration lists marijuana as a Schedule I drug, and still has the power to arrest those who buy, sell, or consume it. The 24 states and the District of Columbia, by refusing to comply with federal law, undermine the rule of law just as much as Kim Davis did.
With more space, I could go into more examples. I could write about the mayor of Baltimore who said, “we also gave those who wished to destroy space to do that,” and list all the reasons why state-sanctioned destruction of private property frustrates the rule of law. Or about sanctuary cities, localities whose officials refuse to work with federal immigration agents. Or how the Supreme Court struck down three of Obama’s appointments to the National Labor Relations Board. Or how the Obama administration in 2011 announced it would not defend the Defense of Marriage Act. But I hope the short examples I provided help to show that those on the Left sometimes relegate the rule of law too.
If one is going to criticize Kim Davis primarily on the grounds that she undermined the rule of law—like White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest did—one also needs to criticize Obama’s unilateral decisions to revise immigration policy, the federal government’s tolerance of heterodox state marijuana laws, and a host of other actions. This is not to say that all these things are equally condemnable; one can bring in considerations other than the rule of law to argue that what Davis did was better or worse than any of the examples listed above. However, it is for those who have selectively criticized Davis to make those arguments.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard University Health Services announced that it would open its newly renovated fifth floor area, formerly home to the 10-bed Stillman Infirmary. In response to student complaints following last year’s announcement of Stillman’s closure, this space will preserve 24-hour urgent care resources, while also expanding crucial mental health and counseling services. Taken together, these changes amount to a positive signal that the administration is listening more to students’ perspectives and making appropriate adjustments to its proposals.
UHS stated plans last November to end overnight care at Stillman Infirmary and direct students to a phone consultation service and, if needed, local hospitals between 10 P.M. and 8 A.M. Meant to shift resources away from underused overnight care to mental health, the decision sparked an outpouring of student concern. A petition argued that students “have used [Stillman] time and again for vastly differing traumas, pains, and illnesses.”
As we opined last fall, students were right to voice concern. Administrators gave little rationale for why all 24-hour service should end, and they made the decision with little to no transparency or student input.
To UHS’s credit, however, their response to the student outcry was swift, and its recent announcement follows through on its adjusted commitments from last year. In this case, the University listened to students on a matter of significance for most segments of the Harvard community. Too often, a lack of attention to student views on issues like the allocation of social space in renovated houses and the recent changes to the Malkin Athletic Center Quad has led to unnecessary discontent and conflict. The original UHS decision to close Stillman and rely on phone consultations and off-campus hospitals was itself a prime example of inadequate communication creating avoidable problems and alienating students.
But UHS’s overall response and its recent announcement mark a break in this trend, and we expect the university to reap the benefits of keeping health services open 24 hours a day. Intoxication to an unsafe degree is a serious concern across the student body, which overnight stays will help manage. Especially given the ongoing discourse about alcohol use at Harvard’s final clubs and its correlation with sexual assault, having options for on-campus after-hours care remains vitally important. As we wrote last year, even if only 250 students used Stillman’s overnight services before its closure, these students’ safety must take precedence in considering changes to overnight operations.
Harvard will also benefit from the increased focus on mental health resources included in UHS’s plans. In February of this year, UHS reported that mental health services would increase by 20 to 25 percent as a result of the renovations to the former Stillman location. Mental health and counseling have proved themselves time and again to be crucial to the well-being of the student body, and their expansion is a welcome sign that another student concern is receiving due attention.
We hope that UHS’s decisions on the future of student health services portend a future of active listening and increased communication between students and administrators. Transparency and open dialogue can prevent many moments of conflict between the administration and the student body; as the University grapples with difficult issues moving forward, they may yet prevent many more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of a movement to unionize students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have entered into an organized partnership with the United Auto Workers Union, according to representatives from both groups.
The UAW currently represents graduate student unions and movements at Columbia and New York University, and UAW Local 1596—the chapter with which the Harvard Graduate Student Union is working—has previously helped graduate student employees to unionize at the University of Massachusetts Boston and Lowell.
Though members of the movement declined to comment on when their partnership with the UAW officially began, the UAW was officially supporting the Harvard graduate student group by last Thursday. Members of Local 1596 were on campus that day helping the Harvard students recruit new members, according to Chris Nook, president of UAW Local 2324.
The union of Harvard graduate students, which first made public its intentions to unionize in April, must expand its membership to include a simple majority of GSAS students as part of the legal requirements to form a union. Even if they reach that threshold, however, the University is not legally bound to recognize a resultant union, according to a 2004 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board. 
University President Drew G. Faust echoed the sentiments of the 2004 ruling in a May interview, stating her opposition to graduate student unionization and saying that a union would change “a mentoring relationship between faculty and students into a labor relationship” and that such a relationship would not be “appropriate.”
Still, members of the movement remain hopeful.
“We join with the tens of thousands of grad employees across the country in one international union,” said Jack Nicoludis, a spokesperson for the Harvard graduate student unionization effort. “Being part of an international union means we are able to effectively build our union here at Harvard.”
And with the help of UAW, the group has started gathering signatures of support on cards that count as individual pledges as they attempt to reach the 50 percent, plus one, minimum, Nicoludis said.
Members of the Harvard unionization movement are also hoping that the NLRB will reverse the 2004 decision that now allows the University to refuse to recognize graduate student unions. The NLRB heard a case from members of a similar movement at Columbia in March and could rule in favor of the graduate students in that case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s finest gathered under the sloping ceiling of Memorial Church on Saturday to celebrate the life of James F. Rothenberg ’68, a longtime member of the Harvard Corporation who died unexpectedly in July at the age of 69, reportedly of a heart attack. 
Rothenberg’s friends and colleagues, one by one, took the pulpit to share stories that pieced together the many roles Rothenberg filled at Harvard, including University treasurer, chair of the Harvard Management Company board of directors, and devoted alumnus whose love for Harvard flared fervently throughout his life.
“What made Jim so extraordinary was far more than the many roles he held,” said William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation. “He was a character in the integrity of our work. Stated simply there was no person more humane, more decent, and more forgiving than Jim.”
Rothenberg is remembered as a key leader during the 2008 financial crisis, according to former CEO and President of the Harvard Management Company Jane L. Mendillo, when the University endowment took one of the biggest hits in its history. University President Drew G. Faust said in a speech that his confidence and insight helped them get through the market downturn.
“Knowing he was there acting on Harvard’s behalf was like finding a solid piece of ground in an earthquake,” Faust said.
Harvard Corporation members, top administrators, and family members shared personal stories about Rothenberg—how he loved showing off pictures of his growing clan of grandchildren, how he bled the black and gold of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and how he could not help himself from swinging and swaying when he heard “I Could Have Danced All Night” from the musical “My Fair Lady,” which was performed at the service.
Though he held a career in investment management, Rothenberg concentrated in English at Harvard and attributed some of his success in business to his humanities background. Homi K. Bhabha, an English professor whose chair the Rothenberg family endowed, said in a speech that Rothenberg played a crucial role in encouraging the humanities disciplines and inspired him to “make the best type of trouble.”
Evelynn M. Hammonds, a professor and the former dean of the College, invoked one of Rothenberg’s favorite works of literature—J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series—during her speech, quoting a moment in the seventh book in the series when Dumbledore tells Harry: “It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it.”
“Jim wore his power well,” Hammonds said.
Robert D. Reischauer ’63, a former senior fellow of the Corporation, said Rothenberg helped bring Corporation members into the digital age after joining the governing board in 2004.
Several speakers remembered Jim for his email sign-offs—sometimes “cheers,” and sometimes “keep fighting.” But to Faust, he would write “onward.” Tearing up at the service, she spoke to him, promising to continue the work he had done.
“Yes, Jim, somehow, we will proceed onward,” Faust said, noticeably emotional.
The service was followed by a reception in Quincy House, where Rothenberg lived as a student, and whose Stone Hall he helped renovate.

As he and other representatives of Harvard’s undergraduate Admissions Office prepare to hit the road this weekend to host information sessions for prospective applicants, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 says the issue of campus sexual assault is on his mind.
Since the results of a nationwide sexual conduct climate survey were released last Monday and top administrators characterized Harvard’s results as “troubling” and “deeply distressing,” the Admissions Office has been weighing the best way to discuss the survey’s findings with applicants and their parents.
Among other points, the survey found that 31 percent of senior female respondents at the College reported having experienced some kind of sexual misconduct—what the survey termed “nonconsensual sexual contact”—during their time there. According to Fitzsimmons, his office plans to acknowledge the upsetting nature of the results and direct applicants toward publications like The Crimson for context and student perspectives. 
“We feel that students have the greatest credibility on these issues,” said Fitzsimmons, adding that he planned to refer applicants to a Crimson editorial published last week.
Respondents to The Crimson’s annual freshman survey this summer indicated that they thought about the issue of sexual assault when applying to college. Thirty-four percent of female respondents in the Class of 2019 said they considered the culture and policies surrounding sexual assault when deciding whether to attend Harvard, while only 11 percent of male students said the same.
While the Admissions Office is prepared to answer questions about the survey’s findings, multiple admissions experts agreed that the results were not likely to deter many students from applying to Harvard.
“I don’t see that [the results] could possibly mount to a significant drop in applications,” said Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions at the University of Virginia. “By and large Harvard is a school that takes proactive, or at least reactive, steps to address issues as they come up.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, agreed that the survey results alone would probably not significantly affect the College’s applicant pool, but predicted that Harvard’s sexual assault response systems would come under closer scrutiny this admissions cycle.
“My guess with prospective applicants is they’ll be most interested in what happens next. They’re going to be asking, ‘What is Harvard doing to address this problem?’” he said.
Laura Bennett, the president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, agreed that applicants should consider other factors like prevention and education programs, support systems for assault victims, and the overall social scene when evaluating a college’s sexual conduct climate.
“Rather than let a statistic deter a student from applying to the school of their choice, applicants may want to look at the overall campus culture around sexual misconduct,” Bennett wrote in an email.
Lake praised University President Drew G. Faust for hosting a town hall meeting to discuss the survey results the day they were released and suggested that the survey would lead to more open conversation about campus sexual assault during the admissions process.
“The survey is almost certainly going to change the national approach that was common for years, which was just to not talk about assault because you might spook the applicants,” Lake said.
For his part, Fitzsimmons said the survey confirmed that campus sexual assault “has been a big issue for a long time.”
“Now that we have hard evidence of it, that’s the point where we can begin understanding the scale of the situation,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student representatives from 27 colleges across the country participated in a two-day conference this weekend focused on key issues of voter registration and increased civic involvement among college students.
Hosted by the Institute of Politics and the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement, students debated the common obstacles preventing millennial engagement with politics. During moderated discussions, participants suggested that students may tend to focus only on larger events, such as presidential or gubernatorial elections, and may hesitate to join a political party that does not fully represent their interests.
“I feel strongly about some fiscally conservative issues, and some socially liberal issues,” said Mikayla Bodey, a student at Ohio State University’s John Glenn College of Public Affairs. “Across the board, millennials are not cookie-cutter voters.”
Some student attendees said they left the conference motivated to galvanize their peers and effect political change.
"There is space for improvement in political efficacy among millennials,” said Gavin S. Sullivan ’17, the IOP student chair of the National Campaign, “and although we're becoming more informed through incredible developments in social media and technology, now it is a matter of taking those devices and stretching beyond the soundbytes and infographics to change policy for the better.”
In addition to students from throughout the United States, professors and administrators also shared their views at the conference. Catherine McLaughlin,  the IOP's executive director, said “this allows the administration to talk about best practices and how they can help the students, and allows for students to meet others with different experiences and yet still find common ground.”
Among other problems, conference attendees discussed long bureaucratic processes and technicalities of organizing student protest. Some participants argued that student activists were lacking a safe space to express their opinions because of the “scapegoat effect” in which people respond negatively to a political affiliation rather than engaging in deeper political discourse.
National debt, sexual assault, national security, wealth inequity, education costs, and climate change were also listed as relevant issues that should capture college students’ attention.
Participants heralded the conference as an opportunity for student leaders to gain experience engaging their peers in politics.

More than 100 runners gathered in front of Newell Boathouse on Sunday morning to commemorate Canadian marathoner and cancer research activist Terry Fox in the Harvard Canadian Club’s second annual “Terry Fox Run.”
In two separate runs along the Charles River covering distances of 2.5 and 5 kilometers, the event formed part of a Canadian tradition brought to Harvard Square by members of the Canadian Club, according to event organizer Johnny Tang ’18.
Although he estimates that the event raised more than $1,000, Tang said the purpose of the event was not only to fundraise, but also to encourage participation and promote awareness.
In 1980, Fox, an athlete who had previously lost his right leg to cancer, embarked on a run across Canada to raise money and awareness for cancer research. He died before fulfilling his goal, but he became national hero, and events like Sunday’s run have become annual traditions in Canada.
In accordance with Fox’s original intentions, the event had no corporate sponsors, required registration fees, or required donations, according to Tang.
“I’ve done this run with every single school, every single year since probably grade 1,” said Tang, a Toronto native. “And I think it’s important because it’s not one of those shenanigan, donation, or fundraising sorts. This is genuinely a wholly good cause.”
Amid chatter among the participants and music from Canadian band “Down With Webster,” runners and walkers echoed Tang’s sentiment.
Harvard Law School student Shane K. Hebel added that the run was an opportunity to “get to know all the Canadians here.”
Yutong Shan, a graduate student and teaching fellow in Astronomy, highlighted the lifelong significance of the event.
“I remember raising money for events like this when I was younger, all throughout elementary school and middle school,” he said. “It just kind of stays with you.”

Hundreds of students and Cambridge locals gathered around campus on Sunday night to watch a rare astronomical phenomenon that has not occurred since 1982 and will not take place again until 2033.
The super blood moon marks both a perigee moon, when the moon is at its closest point in its orbit to the Earth, and a lunar eclipse, when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned as the moon passes in front of the Earth’s shadow. During the phenomenon, the moon appears dark red as its surface reflects the Earth’s sunrises and sunsets.
The perigee moon also appears 14 percent larger in diameter, according to Astronomy professor Jonathan E. Grindlay.
Students flocked to the Astronomy Lab, Clay Telescope, and the Loomis-Michael Observatory at the Science Center for the opportunity to peer through specialized telescopes and binoculars during the super blood moon’s peak from 10:11 p.m. to 11:23 p.m.
According to Chris J. Merchantz ’16, the president of the on-campus organization Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe, the Loomis-Michael Observatory is typically only open to those who have attended a training class to work with the telescopes and then received swipe access. The observatory was open to the public on Sunday evening.
Harvard staff and faculty also opened up the Clay Telescope, which is normally reserved for academic purposes, on the Science Center’s rooftop for the occasion.
“It didn’t seem fair to not let people come up and get the better view from the rooftop here and take a look through the telescope,” Grindlay said.
Grindlay added that such rare astronomical events brew a lot of excitement about space. More than 200 students cycled through the Science Center Sunday evening, he said.
Eric H. Lu ’17, who visits the telescopes often, added, “This is actually the most crowded I’ve seen this particular place in a while.”
For her part, Allyson Bieryla, manager of the Astronomy Lab and Clay Telescope, was “thrilled” that so many people had come to enjoy this rare event at the Science Center.
“This is what we live for. It’s a great opportunity, and people really get excited about astronomy,” Bieryla said. “That’s what I love about astronomy...in general is it really brings that...love of basic science.”
Lu enjoyed seeing textbook astronomy material in the flesh.
“[The super blood moon] is totally predictable, and we know exactly what it’ll look like, and we’ve got all these models and everything, but it’s still pretty cool to see this void open up in the sky and [watch it] fill with blood,” Lu said, chuckling.
Students also gathered at Weeks Bridge along the Charles River, in the Quad, and in and around Harvard Yard—at viewing points including The Crimson's rooftop—to watch the moon.
Nikitha B. Reddy ’19 and Ahilya Khadka ’19 soaked up the last moments of the sight in the Yard after returning from the Charles’s banks.
“It was really great seeing a lot of Harvard students down there and watching something happen outside. I think it’s a nice change from being cooped inside,” Reddy said.

On Friday at the Coast to Coast Battle of Beantown at Franklin Park in Boston, the Harvard cross country team emerged from two crowded fields to earn a pair of top-10 finishes. The men’s team took sixth place out of 21 teams, and the women’s team finished seventh out of 24.
On the women’s side, sophomore Courtney Smith led the way with a fifth-place finish in the 5K. Junior Brandon Price was the Crimson’s top runner on the men’s side, finishing 21st.
“I thought both teams had a solid day,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to see how we matched up against some nationally ranked teams as well as some of the top teams in the Northeast. It gave us a good idea of where we are and what we need to work on.”
Smith was a standout for the women’s team, staring down a field with some of the best runners in the nation and working her way to a 16:58.1 time.
“Courtney Smith was fifth overall, which is extremely impressive,” associate head coach Patrick Wales-Dinan said. “She’s looking like a high-level national runner right now. She beat a couple of multiple-time All-Americans and was right with a few women who are the best in the country. She beat out all the other Ivy League runners in the race, including the defending champ, so we’re happy about that.”
Paige Kouba, the captain of the Crimson women, also did well, finishing 19th with a time of 17:28.5. Smith and Kouba anchored Harvard on Friday, and combined with solid performances from the third and fourth-place finishers, they guided the Crimson to seventh place overall.
Although Harvard bested its performance in the same meet from last year, when the Crimson finished eighth, the team is still looking to improve upon its results so far this season.
“We need to have a number five runner step up, and we need to have someone emerge into that role,” Wales-Dinan said. “We’ve got a bunch of really good candidates, but moving forward, that’s an area of need that we need to address.”
Kouba would likely agree, as the captain admitted that the team was not completely satisfied with its finish.
“In general, I think we were a little disappointed with the day,” Kouba said. “We sort of had the goal to be a top-three team and ended up getting seventh. While we got out there and tried hard, I think it wasn’t the kind of day we had been hoping for.”
Price was the best individual runner for the men on Friday, finishing 21st with a time of 24:28.6 in the 8K. In a packed field of 189 runners, the junior managed to outpace a variety of opponents from nationally-ranked schools.
“I was pleased with Brandon Price,” Saretsky said. “I thought he had a really strong race. It was great to see him be our top runner and be up here as one of the top guys in the Ivy League.”
The Harvard squad finished sixth—third among the four Ivy League teams that participated—ending the day with 172 points. Dartmouth and Cornell placed higher, earning second and fourth-place finishes, respectively.
Crimson freshman Austin Gilbert certainly impressed at his second career varsity meet. Running in the 8K, he battled to a 39th place finish with a time of 24:47.0. The Ridgefield, Conn., native was a crucial part of Harvard’s success on Friday, contributing to a top five that all finished between 21st and 44th place.
Harvard hopes that its performances at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Meet and the Battle of Beantown will lead to some positive momentum for its upcoming races.
“It’s still early in the season, and we’ve got a lot of work to put in, but I’m excited for the season,” Saretsky said. “I think both our men’s and women’s teams can improve on where we were last year. It should be a lot of fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense was the name of the game this weekend as the Harvard men’s water polo team (6-6) faced off against three teams in New York and New Rochelle, N.Y. After a tight 12-11 loss on Saturday to St. Francis Brooklyn (7-4), Harvard swept Fordham (6-6) and Iona (2-8), 11-4 and 22-13, respectively, on Sunday.
“Our defense was definitely something we did a pretty good job of and that I was happy with,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “When you come to New York, it’s three different kinds of pools, and you’re changing what you’re doing at all times offensively and defensively. Overall, I thought we played well.”
HARVARD 22, IONA 13
The Crimson leapt ahead to a 4-0 lead over Iona in the opening minutes of the first quarter with a pair of goals from captain Ben Zepfel, and one apiece from senior attackers Noah Harrison and Blake Lee. By the end of the game, Harrison and Zepfel netted career-highs in scoring with eight and seven goals, respectively.
On the other end of the pool, the defense supplemented the offense’s 22-goal attack by allowing only four goals in the first half.
“We did a great job on the perimeter, which allows our two-meter defenders to do a better of job of being able to not worry about the ball moving around from side to side,” Minnis said. “It allows them to do what they do best.”
HARVARD 11, FORDHAM 4
In its first game on Sunday, the Crimson limited the Rams to a shooting percentage of just 14 percent on 28 shots, holding them to a season-low four goals.
“One thing that I was very proud about with our morning game wasn’t just the margin of scoring, but the fact that we held the other team to just four goals,” junior two-meter Dan Stevens said. “I think our defense was phenomenal in that game. We had some great goalie play by Anthony Ridgley, our freshman, and our defense overall was very, very solid.”
Ridgley made a career-high 11 saves in the win—matching the number of times Harvard found the back of the net.
Aggressive offense solidified the Crimson’s victory, as freshman attacker Nick Bunn found the net early in the game. Harrison then netted a hat-trick in the second quarter, and five different members of the team scored in the second half.
ST. FRANCIS 12, HARVARD 11
Despite facing a 5-1 deficit at the end of the first quarter, Harvard managed to rally its way back against the Terriers in its first game of the weekend. A hat trick from Lee helped the Crimson to tie the game, 9-9, at the end of the third quarter.
Harvard jumped ahead with two more goals in the fourth, but St. Francis responded with two of its own to even the score at 11 with under three minutes to go. Then with just three ticks left on the clock, Terrier junior Bora Dimitrov came up with the dagger, propelling his side to a 12-11 win.
Despite the late blow, the Crimson’s renewed defensive stronghold limited the Terriers to just seven goals over the final three quarters, and Stevens believes that set the tone for the rest of the weekend.
“I think something we can take away from that game is to be a lot more consistent with our game plan,” Stevens said. “A lot of times we would deviate from that, especially early on. We actually came back from a 5-1 deficit in the first quarter, and a lot of that was just because we stuck to the game plan and we had much stronger defense going forward after that deficit.”
Senior goalkeeper Colin Woolway recorded 10 saves and three steals in the game. Lee and junior attacker Joey Colton scored four and three goals each, but that wasn’t enough to fend off the Terriers, who have yet to lose a game at home this season.
“I’m not happy because we want to win; that was our goal coming in, and we didn’t achieve that goal,” Minnis said. “But there were some good things, we showed some resilience going from 5-1 to 5-3, so I think there was some positive[s] that we can definitely take away from it.
“But ultimately we don’t do this to lose.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just one half of play, the Harvard football team showed Brown—and the rest of the Ivy League—why it is the favorite to capture back-to-back outright conference championships.
The answer lies in a combination of offensive explosiveness and defensive smothering. The Crimson scored points at will on Saturday night at Harvard Stadium, driving the ball down the field and making the Bears pay for their turnovers. Harvard similarly outmuscled the visitors on the defensive end, wreaking havoc on Brown’s protection scheme and disrupting play after play.
The Crimson led, 37-0, entering the half. A physical Harvard squad had turned what some initially billed as a competitive game into anything but.
“We got on a roll on both sides of the ball, special teams, and it got a little bit out of hand,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “A game like that can sometimes get a little messy, and that was what occurred. But we played really hard.”
Three consecutive plays at the beginning of the second quarter summed up the first half. Entering the frame, the Crimson held a 16-0 lead, and it was still very much anybody’s game.
The same could not be said moments later.
First, senior running back Paul Stanton capped a 50-yard touchdown drive by pushing his way through the line to score on a short third-and-goal attempt.
On the very next offensive play for the Bears, their senior quarterback, Marcus Fuller, looked to connect with a receiver downfield on the left sideline. But senior defensive back Asante Gibson jumped the route, snared the ball out of the air, and juked all the way down to Brown’s six-yard line.
With the Harvard offense back on the field, senior quarterback Scott Hosch did not hesitate, immediately hitting senior wide receiver Seitu Smith II in the back of the end zone for another touchdown. Suddenly, the score was 30-0. Even though there were 12 minutes remaining in the second quarter, the contest seemed out of reach.
The Crimson demonstrated this very explosiveness all night long. When things went poorly for the Bears, Harvard seemed to always make its opponents pay in the form of points.
“When we see our defense with so much energy, our special teams playing so well, it’s a lot of fun to go out there and just focus on our jobs and play hard, play physical,” senior offensive lineman Cole Toner said.
A BAFFLED BROWN
Over the past several years, Brown has typically given the Crimson competitive games. Last season, for instance, Harvard trailed the Bears deep into the third quarter before ultimately pulling out an eight-point victory.
Saturday’s matchup bore little resemblance to such contests. Throughout much of the first half, Brown’s offense demonstrated an inability to advance the ball with any consistency. And at other moments, the Bears committed miscues that caused their coaching staff to scratch their heads.
Take Brown’s second offensive possession of the game. On a third-and-eight at the Brown 25, senior defensive back Sean Ahern made a beeline for Fuller on the quarterback’s blindside.
Untouched by any blocker on the blitz attempt, Ahern leveled Fuller, who coughed up the football. Senior linebacker Jacob Lindsey scooped up the fumble and waltzed into the end zone for the Crimson’s first defensive touchdown of the year.
Two possessions later, it was the Bears’ special teams causing headaches. With Brown lining up to punt on its own 15-yard line, sophomore defensive back Zach Miller busted through the punt protection and blocked the attempt. The Bears then kicked the bouncing ball out of their own end zone, resulting in a safety for Harvard.
“I have no explanations for what happened out there,” Brown coach Phil Estes said. “Got a lot of work to do, I know that.”
The Bears did not register a first down in the contest until less than nine minutes remained in the second quarter. Trailing 30-0 a few minutes into that quarter, Brown had just five yards of offense to the Crimson’s 163. Estes’s team finished with three lost fumbles, one interception, and one turnover-on-downs.
ODDITIES
The few fans that stuck it out for the length of Saturday’s contest were treated to some unusual occurrences. And several came as a result of sloppy play from the Bears.
Early in the third quarter on a Bears’ punt attempt on an excessively long fourth-and-51, the long snapper fired the ball over the head of the Brown punter, causing the unit’s second safety of the game. Murphy couldn’t recall ever having coached in a game that had two safeties from the same team.
After the Bears scored their first touchdown of the game a few possessions later, senior defensive lineman James Duberg blocked Brown’s extra point attempt. Senior defensive back Jordan Becerra picked up the ball and ran it the length of the field, but the Harvard points were nullified by a Crimson penalty.
“It was just one of those days where everything seemed to go right, and just a tough day for Brown,” Murphy said. “That’s not the Brown we’re used to seeing. And if you’re in the game long enough, it happens to everybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One game into the Ivy League schedule, the defending conference champions find themselves in a familiar position.
But it is one that the Harvard women’s volleyball squad would prefer not to be in.
After taking the first set of its Ivy League opener by a commanding margin, the Crimson only managed to take one of the next four, falling to Dartmouth in five sets in the first match of a five-game homestand at the Malkin Athletic Center on Friday.
“The loss was the motivating factor that is necessary for us to push forward to success,” junior Corie Bain said. “Looking back [to last season], we really needed a game like that as a wake up call….. It was a painful learning lesson but one that I think will determine the outcome of our season.”
A four-point run in the final set by the Big Green broke a 7-7 tie and handed a sizable lead to the visiting contingent. But the Crimson brought the deficit to within one point, giving Harvard a chance to tie the game at 14 and force tiebreaking points in the tiebreaking set. But a service error elicited silence from the home crowd and shrieks from the Big Green, ending any chance of completing the comeback.
The Big Green came within range of ending the match in the fourth set, needing only one more point to tie it at 24 points apiece. But Bain set up senior Kathleen Wallace for the set-winning kill to force a fifth and final set.
While the Crimson was able to win two sets, the team ultimately could not slow down the Dartmouth offense, which was led by junior Emily Astarita. The Setauket, N.Y., native and All-Ivy honorable mention led the team with 23 kills. Captain Kaira Lujan followed behind with 14 of her own.
That offense was in full display during the second and third sets of the match. when Astarita recorded 15 of her 23 kills, just shy of half of her team’s total kills during that stretch.
For Harvard, a team that only lost three regular contributors from last year, the middle sets of the game were defined by inexperience. Injuries to junior Grace Weghorst and senior Kathleen Wallace jumbled the lineup construction, limited their action, and forced players out of their natural positions at some points during the game. Several times, an inability to communicate led to unforced errors that ended up being costly.
Freshman Christina Cornelius perhaps played beyond her years, tying junior Grace Weghorst for the team-high in kills with 13, despite only attacking a total of 22 times. The rookie also provided defense in the middle, leading the team with six blocks.
“I think our freshmen stepped up and carried our team throughout the game,” Bain said. “They have a presence on the court that is fresh and new and that is something we upperclassmen need to embrace and mimic in our own play.”
Sophomore Caroline Labanowski has recently been thrust into a prominent role on offense as well, setting her career-high in total attacks in both of her last two matches. The second-year notched double-digit kills for the first time in her career in the loss. Sophomore Paige Kebe, on the other hand, had trouble getting things going, only playing in two sets and recording a lone kill.
“She’ll continue to grow each year,” co-captain Holte said. “I’m excited to watch.”
The match began much differently than how it ended. After playing Dartmouth close for the early portion of the first set, the Crimson went on a 9-1 run to extend its lead to 19-10, whence the team cruised on to win the first set. The later four sets passed by with a different narrative.
The early season loss will have big implications for the Ivy League title chase going forward. No team has won the Ivy League with more than two losses in the new millennium.
“Our team is approaching practice this week as our top priority,” Bain said. “We are [taking] extra hours to train and solidify our foundation as well as altering our mentality to focus on one of our mottos of the season: Success is the only option. This loss has proven to us how much we care.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s soccer team, aggressive play won the day in a battle against Penn on Saturday.
Coming off a tough nonconference slate against opponents including the likes of No. 1 Virginia and now-No. 20 Connecticut, the Crimson (3-6-1, 1-0-0 Ivy) rebounded in its first Ivy League game of the season, launching 25 shots en route to a 2-0 win over Penn (4-2-2, 0-1-0) at Jordan Field.
Senior midfielders Brooke Dickens and Haley Washburn made the difference on offense, scoring a goal apiece to help Harvard take its first step towards capturing the Ancient Eight crown for the third time in as many years.
“We struggled in the pre-Ivy League games to get points on the board, but we took everything we learned, and we played a whole 90 minutes tonight,” junior forward Joan Fleischman said.
Harvard wasted no time putting its aggressiveness on display. An errant pass by Washburn immediately after the kickoff foreshadowed the physical attacking style that the Crimson would employ throughout its victory over the Quakers.
Penn could not match up to this style of play, managing just five shots on the day to Harvard’s 25.
“Ivy League games are always about who wants it more, who’s more physical,” Fleischman said. “We brought it tonight, we won the physical battle, and that’s how we won the game.”
The Crimson defense, especially in the midfield, stymied many of Penn’s attempts at moving the ball up the field. As a result, the Quakers were forced to use an aerial attack of chip shots and headers to their forwards over the top of Harvard’s midfielders that did not provide any real test to the Crimson’s back line of defense until the 31st minute of the game.
But even during the latter portion of the first half when Penn began to gain traction towards Harvard’s goal with a few crosses that nearly led to scoring chances, the Crimson defense held firm. The Quakers could only muster one shot before the break.
“We had great defense from the forwards, to the midfield, to the back, to our goalkeeper,” Dickens said. “Everyone was defending. We made it our goal to be first to the ball, and every position did a great job of doing that.”
Harvard’s staunch defense fluidly transitioned to its offensive attack. The Crimson’s prowess and physicality on the ball fostered many flank runs down both sidelines that led to a bevy of crosses, free kick opportunities, and scoring chances.
With only one minute left on the clock before halftime, an untimely Penn foul set up a Harvard free kick that led to the Crimson’s first Ivy League goal of the season. Dickens capitalized, putting the ball in the back of the net after senior defender Alika Keene’s header from the middle of the box missed just wide and funneled to the midfielder following a touch from junior defender Bailey Gary.
“It was definitely a team effort goal—from the foul, the free kick, to Bailey keeping it in on the in-line, and [the ball] just bouncing out to me and kicking it as hard as I possibly could and keeping it low,” Dickens said.
Dickens’s goal, her second of the season would be the only one that Harvard would need. But an additional goal from Fleischman off of another free kick—a cross from Washburn— in the 58th minute set the final score line.
“[It was] really hard from beginning to end, and we just kept the ball,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “It was good to see a release of pent-up frustration for the first few weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team stepped up to the challenge of playing without captain Rohan Ramnath this weekend, placing third overall at the Quechee Club Collegiate Challenge this weekend hosted by fellow Ancient Eight opponent Dartmouth.
In its second tournament of the year, the squad travelled to the Quechee Club in Vermont to face off against 11 other teams, including Ivy League rivals Brown, Cornell, and Penn. Playing 36 holes over two days, the Crimson shot seven-over-par, finishing one stroke behind Rhode Island and five behind the Big Green, who took home first.
“It was a really good weekend for us building off our work from St. John’s two weeks ago,” junior Kendrick Vinar said. “The guys did the right things, worked hard, gave it 100 percent, and gave ourselves a chance coming into today.”
After the first 18 holes of the 36-hole showdown, the Crimson held second place after shooting 290, trailing the hosts by five strokes and leading Rhode Island by eight. However, Harvard was unable to surpass Dartmouth, dropping behind Rhode Island in the process.
“We didn’t quite execute the way we wanted to,” Vinar said.
Following its second-round 293, the Crimson ended with a score of 583. Dartmouth held the lead throughout the tournament, finishing at 578. And by making up an eight-stroke deficit, Rhode Island edged out Harvard with a score of 582.
The battle for the top spot was limited to three teams, as fourth-place Hartford finished 20 shots back of the Crimson. Ancient Eight rival Cornell earned ninth, while Penn and Brown finished 11th and 12th, respectively.
“I think we focused on all the right things we can control. Unfortunately, we were a little bit short from the goal. We’re going to keep working…and hopefully get the results we want next week,” said junior Daniel De La Garza.
Saturday’s leader was John Lazor, a freshman from Dartmouth, who fired a five-under 67. For Harvard, the juniors led the charge in the opening round as De La Garza shot a two-under 70 and Vinar finished one-under with a 71. Both players finished the tournament at an even par, tying for fifth overall at 144.
The individual champion of the tournament was sophomore Billy Walthouse of Rhode Island, who shot a six-under 138.
The three juniors who played—De La Garza, Vinar, and Robert Deng—finished with the team’s three lowest scores, with Deng shooting a 147 to position him at 12th place overall. They were joined on the course by freshman Aurian Capart and sophomore Hale Furey.
After shooting for par in the second round, Capart finished with a four-over 148 to go along with a 13th place finish. Meanwhile, Furey finished five shots behind him with a 153 for the tournament.
“All the guys are really good at just taking care of their own stuff,” Vinar said. “They all stepped up… and took on the responsibility, and they just played their games. Frankly, we’ve got a really deep team right now. One through nine, we’ve really got a lot of guys who can shoot some really good numbers.”
That depth was needed this weekend. After tying a Harvard record for the lowest single-round score with a 64 in the Doc Gimmler Invite, Ramnath stayed home for the weekend due to injury.
“Obviously, Rohan is a great player and we’d love to have him out here with us, but we’re glad that he’s taking care of himself,” Vinar said. “We hope that he’ll be out here shortly.”
The team focused on honing in on key facets of its game, improving from its fourth-place finish two weekends ago at the Doc Gimmler. Next weekend, the Crimson will get a chance to compete against more Ancient Eight rivals as it heads to Yale for the MacDonald Cup.
“I think one of the issues at [Doc Gimmler] was that the team was tired…. So we really tried to pace ourselves,” De La Garza said. “ [The players] practiced what they think they needed to and rested. I think we balanced very well resting and playing. We’re going to keep working and try to do our best and hopefully get the results we want next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following its record-setting win last week against Yale last weekend, the Harvard women’s rugby team (2-1, 1-1 Ivy) dropped its first game of the season to defending Ivy League champion Brown (3-0, 2-0) on Saturday.
Coming in with a young squad full of talent, the Crimson looked to steal a win in Providence over its biggest Ivy League rival after getting trounced by the Bears, 27-5, in the semifinals of last year’s Ivy League Championship. But Harvard came up short a second time, falling to the hosts by a score of 44-17.
“Clearly Brown had a very similar game plan as we had,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “What they had that we didn’t have was some really well orchestrated lines by their forwards and their backs which resulted in tries. They were able to execute their game plan because they were so much bigger than us in the scrum.”
The Crimson’s last victory against the Bears came two years ago when Harvard came out on top, 31-5, in the semifinals of the Ivy League Championship. The Crimson would go on to win the Ivy League title that year.
Brown got off to an early start on Saturday, scoring off a scrum for its first try and then scoring and converting again within the first ten minutes of the match to take a 12-0 lead. Harvard would not relent, however, with senior Ann-Marie Barrett scoring off a successful line-out off an assist from junior Mariah Turner and sophomore Haley Langan.
But despite some key defensive plays from captain Hope Schwartz and a key stop at the try line, Harvard would concede another two tries to leave the score at 22-5 in favor of the Bears at the half.
Coming into the contest, scrum control and making positive tackles were among the things the team felt it needed to work on. Following its first victory at West Chester two weeks ago, Schwartz, a former Crimson sports editor, revealed some of the team’s goals before the start of Ivy League play.
“The biggest thing we’re trying to improve is our mentality at the point of contact; rugby is a very heavy contact game,” said Schwartz following the West Chester game. “It can be a very violent game and what we were able to do this week was really to just up our vision at the point of contact.”
But come Saturday, nothing would come easy for Harvard.
However, in the second half, the Crimson struck first. Harvard scored on a try and converted off the kickoff to cut Brown’s lead to ten. But from there, the Bears went on to score consecutive tries and a conversion before the Crimson would retaliate with a try from freshman Grace Chao on an assist from junior Claire Collins. That try at 20:55 would be the last score of the match for Harvard.
For 15 minutes after Harvard’s last try, a series of good defensive plays would prevent either team from scoring. Brown broke the stalemate, however, when it scored off an offsides penalty against the Crimson. The Bears then scored another try and conversion to close out the game, 44-17.
Despite the loss, Parker referred to the loss as an important lesson for a young squad hoping to compete for the Ivy League Championship.
“This game is singularly important as a learning tool for our young team to understand exactly what we’re going to face if we’re to achieve our goal of winning the Ivy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team earned two big wins on its weekend road trip, following up a 2-1 double-overtime shootout victory at Yale (2-5, 0-1 Ivy) on Saturday with a 5-3 win over UMass Lowell (5-4, 0-1 America East) on Sunday.
On Saturday, the score in New Haven was notched at one goal apiece after 100 minutes of play, setting up a game-deciding shootout. In the second round of the shootout, senior Elizabeth Jacobson scored to put the Crimson (5-2, 1-0 Ivy) up, 1-0. Then after Yale tied it up in the fourth round on freshman Marissa Medici’s tally, Jacobson put the game away by scoring the winning goal in the seventh round.
“Definitely beating Yale was a huge thing for us, as the first in Ivy League play,” Jacobson said. “It kept our heads up high.”
Jacobson proceeded to follow up her game-clinching performance by scoring two goals on Sunday afternoon against the River Hawks.
HARVARD 5, UMASS LOWELL 3
Harvard scored twice in a span of two minutes and put up three tallies overall in the first half, never looking back en route to a two-goal win in Lowell.
The River Hawks scored twice late in the second half to pull within two goals, but the early deficit proved to be too much to overcome.
“We kept shooting on goal,” co-captain midfielder Caroline Code said. “We had a lot more quality shots.”
The Crimson only had nine shots on goal all day, a drastic reduction from Saturday’s number, but the quality of the shots was reflected in the larger number of shots that went in.
Jacobson picked up where she left off on Saturday, scoring in the 20th minute to put Harvard up, 1-0. Two minutes later, junior forward Sarah Finnemore scored her first goal of the season off of a corner rebound.
Even with a two-goal advantage, the Harvard offense was unrelenting. Junior forward Marissa Balleza continued her hot streak by scoring her team-leading seventh goal of the season on a breakaway chip shot just before halftime, making the score 3-0.
After the break, UML got on the board in the 41st minute, but Harvard took the tally back in the 49th minute to retain its thre-goal advantage. The Crimson was able to stretch the lead to 5-1 before holding off the River Hawk’s rallying effort.
The weekend sweep extended the Crimson’s winning streak to four games.
“Staying on a win streak definitely keeps the motivation going,” Jacobson said. “I’m very excited for the rest of the season.”
HARVARD 2, YALE 1
All day long, Harvard dominated when it came to shots, outshooting the Bulldogs, 33-9, with 17 of those shots on goal versus Yale’s five.
Bulldogs’ junior goalie Emilie Katz managed to hold the Crimson at bay with 16 saves, but ultimately, it was not enough, as Harvard was able to slip by in double overtime.
“We hustled,” Code said. “Our game plan was to stick to our positioning, to shut down their lanes, and move with the ball.”
The Bulldogs got on the scoreboard first in the 14th minute of the game. However, 48 minutes later, Balleza cast the game into a tie after converting an assist from freshman forward Kathleen Young.
The game continued with Yale and the Crimson neck and neck. Then in the final minute, Jacobson came up with one final chance to break the tie. However, Jacobson’s shot attempt from a penalty corner was deflected by Katz in the final few seconds. Even in the two overtime periods, Katz was able to fend off Harvard’s forward pressure with eight saves resulting in a penalty shootout.
During the shootout, Jacobson helped the Crimson gain the lead early with a goal in the second round.
“I really love shootouts,” Jacobson said with a laugh. “I just trusted my gut and took a shot.”
However, the Bulldogs responded in the fourth round, when Medici found the back of the net. With the fifth and final round of the shootout ending with both teams not scoring, the teams traded opportunities one shot a time. After a sixth round of no goals, it was Jacobson who clinched the win for Harvard with her seventh-round shot. The following Yale shooter was unable to follow through with an equalizing goal, resulting in a hard-fought win for the Crimson.
“It’s really awesome to open up Ivy League play with a win over Yale,” Code said. “But we like to take it one game at a time. We like to say the most important game is the next one.”

Introducing Study Buddy Burger Monday (try saying that five times quickly) at Shake Shack! Every Monday through December 21st, Shake Shack invites students to come with a friend, buy a burger, and show a student ID to receive another free burger. Note that the buy-one-get-one free promotion does not apply if you show up alone– bringing a “study buddy” along is required. After all, “Shack-ademics” wants to promote p-setting with portobello (the vegetarian portobello ‘Shroom Burger that is), not obesity.
