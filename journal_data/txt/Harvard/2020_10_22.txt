After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether it be COVID-19 or an ancient monster crawling to shore from the irradiated depths of the sea, humans have never interacted well with what they do not know. We have an uncanny ability to provoke, disrespect, and vilify the unknown: What is unmanageable is automatically perceived as a liability, a tumor to be excised from our neat cultural fallacy of total knowing.
This visceral aversion for what is not in our likeness manifests in a multitude of all too familiar ways: racism, ethnocentrism, xenophobia, and systemic brutality. But what happens when humanity itself bands together to face off against a non-human foe? How do our embodied conceptions of alterity, safety, and righteousness interface with the ways in which we attempt to control — through political, narrative, and visual currencies — that which is too strange or too sinister to comprehend?
Never in my life did I think I would watch “Godzilla.” I shuddered when friends proposed “The Conjuring” as quality sleepover bonding, shielded my eyes for the majority of “It,” and to this day refuse to finish the flower-wreathed, psychedelic nightmare that is “Midsommar.” I was exasperated by what I saw as a cultural pattern of violence, blood, and bodily mutilation injected into films for aestheticized shock value. Only a few weeks ago, when the film “Gojira” was assigned in one of my courses, did I learn that before the United States distorted the cinematic idea into their garish, violent franchise, “Godzilla” was not “Godzilla.” It was “Gojira,” a deeply felt, politically nuanced film by Japanese director Ishirō Honda that explores the implications of nuclear fallout and diplomatic tensions in the Pacific.
What I thought would be an hour and 30 minutes of a rubber-suit monster dragging its feet around a burning metropolis turned out to be much more complex and much less overstated. Honda’s film is a gripping ecocritical treatise on the urgency of human accountability, as well as a cautionary tale of the unforeseen consequences of careless militaristic violence: As viewers later discover, the monster’s escape from its watery lair is a direct result of radiation’s disruption of its natural ecosystem, a commentary on the United States’ atomic testing in the Pacific.
Being a black and white film, “Gojira” depends heavily on light — or the lack thereof — as a narrative tool. An aesthetic binary pervades the treatment of light in the movie: There exists an unnatural, radioactive light, connoting violence and domination, and a softer natural light suggestive of divinity, restoration, and peace. To heighten suspense, Gojira is first introduced to the audience in an intentionally obscure way; rather than glimpse the monster itself, viewers bear witness to an uncomfortably bright stream of light that shoots from the ocean, torching a humble fishing boat bobbing in tumbling black waves. The lancing brightness forebodes strange and uncontrollable forces, a stark juxtaposition from illumination as a guiding source of life in the world as we know it.
“Gojira,” in other words, extends to viewers a visual politics of light. The interlocking sources of tension and danger in the film — government secrets, shocking scientific breakthroughs, and a ravenous ancient monster — are illuminated either too little or too well, often to the detriment of those who have the misfortune of bearing witness.
Like the radioactive fallout in the Pacific during the 1950s, COVID-19 looms so large as a point of existential contention in the global psyche precisely because of its invisible ubiquity. The vicissitudes of statistics and scientific conjecture regarding the future of the pandemic communicate a singular truth: In this increasingly surreal world, uncertainty is king. The resounding question mark pervading our collective wellbeing demands from each of us something we are enormously uncomfortable with: a continual interrogation of how and what we know.
Similar to how the townspeople in Honda’s film perpetuate the haunting refrain “It’s just a myth” to dismiss the reality of the sea monster, we, too, bear witness to alarming percentages of the United States’ populace positing the same about a virus that has claimed upwards of 220,000 American lives. The denial of science has long been instrumentalized as a political tool to undermine narratives, promote agendas, and polarize communities. Honda’s admonitions ring uncannily true in our contemporary culture — what, then, is our politics of light? What questions, anxieties, and narratives will we choose to over-illuminate in this time of shared obscurity? Perhaps more important, what uneasy truths will we keep concealed in the dark?
A future steeped in uncertainty is, indeed, its own sort of terrifying monstrosity, and we do not seem to have many answers. But perhaps this is exactly what Honda’s message insists: that we have the astuteness to sit with our unknowing before deciding how to confront the monster before us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My introduction to punk was a fairly standard one. It started with my family’s vinyl collection, when an initial interest in the influences of the grunge and rock bands that made up the soundtrack to my childhood soon became personal excursions into the music of the Dead Kennedys, the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, and anything else punk or punk-adjacent I could get my hands on.
One facet of my music taste was always set in stone, though: I refused to like music made in Spanish. Trying as hard as I could to blend into the hyper-saturated Americana I falsely believed was required of me, I decided that all the Latin American rock music my parents listened to — music that varied from the prog rock of Sui Generis to the alternative grooves of Maná— was nothing but a cheap copy of the real deal. The “real deal,” of course, being the music that came from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the traditionally cited punk canon, the holy trinity of punk releases are The Ramones’ self-titled album, The Saints’ “(I’m) Stranded,” and The Damned’s EP, “New Rose.” Released in 1976, these three are considered to be the first ever releases of the genre. Even the more liberal estimates of punk’s origins pin its first releases as happening only a couple of years earlier in the early ‘70s.
These bands are all white. They hail from the Queens, New York; Brisbane, Australia; and London, England, respectively.
My vision of punk, like that of the mainstream, was exactly what the holy trinity represented. Punk, to me, was a space created by and for white, cisgender, heterosexual men. Any other identity that had managed to wrangle its way into the scene’s spotlight — including women and racially marginalized groups — was an exception won through uphill battles against the genre’s established norms.
Long before Johnny, Tommy, Joey, and Dee Dee picked up their instruments, however, garage punk band Los Saicos was already making punk music in Lima, Peru. It wasn’t just proto-punk like the music coming from the Velvet Underground or The Stooges, either. It was punk: grungy, heavy, and sonically supercharged.
Started by four guys from the middle-class Lince neighborhood of Lima — Erwin Flores, Francisco Guevara, Roland “El Chapo” Carpio, and César “Papi” Castrillón — Los Saicos blazed through the Peruvian music scene for the brief year or so that they existed as a band. In their short-lived career, they released a total of 12 songs, but they were already widely popular — playing on TV shows and touring Peru’s clubs — before they even cut their first single.
Their most famous track, 1965’s “Demolición,” is loud and gritty as guitarist Erwin Flores’s strained vocals about wreaking havoc on a train station are punctuated by drummer Francisco Guevara’s crashing cymbals and a raging guitar riff for the entirety of the three-minute song. The production is muddy and raw, allowing the band’s nascent punk ferver to take center stage. The single is arguably years ahead of anything happening in the U.S. or the U.K., but it was a massive hit in Peru, earning the band a spot at the top of the national charts.
“El entierro de los gatos” is something else entirely. While “Demolición” showcased the band’s potential as they developed their punk sound, “El entierro” proclaimed that the process of inventing punk was complete. “You tell me what song preceded it?” Flores asks about the song in an interview with Noisey. “It was an absolute invention…. I mean, it’s such a ridiculous thing that it has been left out of music history.”
Vocals that, in “Demolición,” were still somewhat melodic are replaced in “El entierro” by what can be described as none other than a scream, Flores’s voice breaking under its own force. The guitar riff, created by El Chapo, is incessant under layer upon layer of violent shouts and animalistic screeches until it devolves into a chaotic tangle of cymbal crashes and feedback. With “El entierro,” Los Saicos introduced their fanbase to a full-on musical assault the likes of which no one had ever heard before. Some critics have gone so far as to call it “sonic vandalism.” It is the perfect punk record and yet it was released way ahead of its time in 1965. Indeed, Los Saicos were the first of their kind.
Though revolutionary in Peru, Los Saicos’ popularity dropped steeply outside of South America, in the purported cradles of punk: the U.K. and the U.S. In fact, they were (and continue to be) virtually unknown. Cole Alexander of punk band The Black Lips still cites them as “one of the best kept secrets.”
When I discovered “Demolición” and the secret of Los Saicos buried deep amongst other 7-inches in a dusty bin at my favorite local record store, it became my own little revolution. I had grown up convincing myself that there was no value in music that represented my own Latinx identity outside of its proximity to the established mainstream, and yet here was this single that held all the right components that made music by bands like the Ramones so renowned, and it was created more than a decade earlier in a country that bordered my parents’ own.
The Saicos weren’t the only punk band blasting on Latin American airwaves in the years that followed. Despite being its creators, the movement did not end with their short-lived recording career. Instead, Los Saicos bred a burgeoning punk movement in Latin America that would find greater musical prowess, stronger political motivation, and increasingly larger audiences in the decades to come.

If you type “sell out” into the search bar of the Harvard Confessions Facebook page, a number of posts pop up. One laments “wanting to sell out” but being “too deep in nonprofit work to do so.” Another characterizes one’s friends “sell[ing] out one by one” as “the saddest thing to see.” Yet another describes being a premed as “one of the most sell out tracks that exist,” glossing medicine as a career that makes “cuts in people’s bodies and bank accounts to buy that new Rolex.” Most of the remaining posts are similar, contrasting the altruism of non-governmental agencies and social work with the selfishness of the for-profit world.
Like many generalizations, this picture contains a kernel of truth. We’re all called to contribute our utmost to social welfare, a mission NGOs aim toward explicitly. Those who sacrifice life and livelihood to fight social and biological pathologies deserve our utmost praise. And it’s hard to argue that financial institutions or even medical corporations have always done their part to serve the global community.
But implicit in the profit-nonprofit divide is the assumption that the latter is the only way to fulfill the call to serve humanity, or at least the best way. And not only is this wrong — it’s borderline elitist.
The truth is, the number of us who will ever have a significant impact on people outside our families and local communities is vanishingly small. In part, this is due to the societal distribution of labor: there will always be more jobs in healthcare and sales than in nonprofit management or social work. But even on the nonprofit side, it’s rare that anyone is so indispensable that their absence would have irremediable effects. True, there are some once-in-a-generation figures who are in this position, and if you’re one of them, you can stop reading this column. But the biggest impact most people have will be local: in the way they serve their families, their friends, and the disadvantaged in their communities. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this. In fact, some would argue that we have a special ethical obligation at the local level, even above serving global welfare. It’s hard to imagine, for example, that the consultant who abandons his children to dig wells in a third world country is really fulfilling his most immediate obligations to society — especially when he could have used a portion of his salary to fund this very work.
Now, what I’m not saying is that people should avoid entering nonprofit work — far from it! It’s a laudable way to help people in need, and those who sacrifice higher earnings to follow such a vocation should be commended. But it’s wrong to suppose that it’s the only way to serve others, or even the best way for most people. It’s implausible that Bill Gates, who has donated nearly $50 billion to charitable causes, would have better served the world by starting his career in the nonprofit sector. And while essentially no one attains Gates’s level of wealth, the principle applies even to those of far more modest means. Consider the case of Sylvia Bloom, the legal secretary who amassed and donated over $8 million to community charities in New York. Or Matt Wage, the philosophy student who entered trading with the intention of giving away half of his pretax income to global health initiatives. True, it’s hard to argue Matt Wage is a typical representative of financial trading. But that’s an indictment of traders as people, not trading as a profession.
What these examples demonstrate, I think, is that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to serving humanity. Some of us are called to do it in social work, others in Big Tech, and still others — like Sylvia Bloom — in for-profit jobs with little visible impact. And this diversity of paths is a very good thing. It means that the impact we have on the world doesn’t reduce to the career track we choose in our early twenties. More importantly, it means that everyone has the opportunity to find service in their work, not just the small percentage who have jobs in the nonprofit sector.
So, if you’re called to be a social worker, go right ahead. If you become an investment banker, be a generous one. But don’t feel like you need to do one or the other — or that the former is the only way to be a good person.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the academic community, the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict H-1B work visas and F and J visa stays were alarming — but not surprising.
By now, we are well aware of the Trump administration’s systematic opposition and denial of scientific investigation. Slashing funding, marginalizing experts, and suppressing certain research have made a mockery of rational decision-making and leadership. A global pandemic has killed over 220,000 Americans, and nearly a third of us believe in coronavirus conspiracies.
Yet even more damaging are the Trump administration’s attacks not against science itself, but against its foundation: its people.
The promise of American research rests on the contributions of immigrant and international trainees. Roughly half of Ph.D.-level science workers and postdoctoral researchers, as well as more than a quarter of science and engineering faculty in the U.S. are immigrants. From groundbreaking discoveries and patents to Nobel Prizes and job creation, immigrants are essential drivers of American scientific innovation. And for decades, the promise of a thriving, global-focused research community has positioned the U.S. as a world leader in science and engineering. “If someone has merits, this is the country where he/she will be recognized,” said Dr. Taslim A. Al-Hilal, who was raised in Bangladesh and now works as an assistant professor at the University of Texas at El Paso’s School of Pharmacy.
But over the past four years, the situation has changed, and national politics are impossible to ignore. Donald Trump and his administration have clearly communicated that immigrants are no longer welcome, and life in America can no longer just be about the research.
For new arrivals to the U.S., Trump’s hateful rhetoric invokes fear and a sense of otherness in an already uncertain situation. Trump’s political rise began when he falsely claimed Barack Obama was not an American and a Muslim, and therefore unfit to serve as President. While in office, he has denounced immigrants from “shithole countries,” demanded that women of color in Congress “go back” to the “crime infested places from which they came,” and implicitly supported a white nationalist movement. Trump’s verbal harassment targeted at Muslim, Latinx, and Black immigrants in particular inspire legitimate concerns for physical safety.
This rhetoric has translated into harmful policy, with over 400 executive actions passed on immigration. This year, H-1B visas were frozen and the Muslim-focused “travel ban” was expanded. Even with valid documents, foreign-born researchers face increasing suspicion and instability. This July, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement abruptly barred international students taking online classes from remaining in the U.S. For students already facing a pandemic, this proclamation threatening deportation was deliberately cruel.
Students forced out of the U.S. would lose laboratory and educational resources, and face disruptions to housing, healthcare, and teaching. Unsurprisingly, the uncertainty caused by this order was a source of major anxiety — just the latest Trump administration action with significant psychological and material consequences for international students. Although later rescinded, the order made clear that the Trump administration will continually probe the boundaries for targeting immigrants.
Altogether, these words and policies have had their intended effect: Accosted by vicious policies, anxious about racist violence, and cut off from their families, foreign-born researchers feel more unwelcome, unsafe, and unable to plan for the future than ever. “The last 4 years have been absolutely exhausting. Each day you wake up wondering if the next policy decision will impact you,” wrote Dr. Ana M. Porras, a Colombian-born assistant professor in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Florida. “I do feel constant anxiety and it often distracts me from doing my research.” Other scholars question how to envision career plans even one or two years ahead, scared that Trump’s possible re-election might result in their having to return to their home countries.
The numbers reflect these feelings. Between 2015 and 2018, international student enrollment in U.S. universities dropped over 10 percent; international students who enrolled elsewhere listed the social and political environment as one of their top reasons. Concurrently, the U.S.’ relative research output has shrunk. Trends indicate a profound loss of international confidence in the U.S. worldwide, eroding its solid research foundation.
President Trump’s policies have been painted as a “war on science,” but this title is insufficient: Trump has attacked not only science but also its people — its humanity. By excluding immigrants and international students, and devaluing their lives and safety, his administration harms our community.
What can we, as academics, do about this? We can begin by learning: understanding immigrants’ stories and their positive impacts on American science, as well as the shifting policy landscape. Informed and motivated, we can contact our representatives, aid organizations involved in immigration justice, and speak out, proudly and vocally, both in support of international researchers and against the administration bent on ending them. We can vote for a candidate whose policies explicitly support science and scientists. In particular, professors have a responsibility to defend the individuals whose contributions have built their careers.
It is time to demonstrate our respect for our immigrant colleagues through voice and action, and preserve science’s humanity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A petition calling on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to declare Election Day, Nov. 3, a University holiday has garnered over 600 signatures. An organizer of the petition emphasized the hope that the designation would confer a “renewed sense of importance” to the day, allowing students, faculty, and staff not only to vote, but to engage in other forms of civic participation, such as working at the polls.
A few days later, Harvard Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann wrote to administrators asking them “to ensure that your managers provide scheduling flexibility to your staff members (particularly those who are paid hourly and who are working on-site) as they exercise their right to vote.”
While we appreciate this intermediate administrative step to protect staff and encourage them to vote, mere flexibility does not go far enough. Particularly for many staff for whom Cambridge real estate prices are prohibitive, the journey to their local polling place may be more than is feasible on a University-granted break from an otherwise full working day. Though the effort is laudable, a full University holiday will do more to encourage voting and civic participation. Moreover, in such a historic election, half-measures are insufficient.
Particularly as voter suppression has become an especially relevant point of concern, the University, with its public platform and influence, should be going above and beyond to encourage voting. Such efforts ought to be framed specifically around the importance of resisting the forces that seek to keep voters from turning out on Election Day.
And though the practical effects seem more pressing for staff – constrained as they are, in many cases, by the need to be physically present on campus to perform their professional duties, unlike most students – the symbolic importance of honoring Election Day as a University holiday goes beyond practicality.
Bacow, as an organizer of the petition noted, sent out an email about the importance of voting, encouraging students and community members to vote and reminding them of the historic struggles for voting rights for women, communities of color, and young people. What better way for the University to send a profound message, on campus, across higher education, and across the United States, than to declare a holiday and work assiduously to provide resources to students, faculty, and staff that give them options for how to get involved in the democratic process, wherever in the country (or the world) they may be.
Yes, we recognize some students may take the day as a pure vacation. No effort to induce civic participation will ever be 100 percent successful. But to act merely on that presumption would be depressingly pessimistic. If Harvard can get one more student to vote, that matters. If Harvard can inspire one more university to take proactive steps to encourage and enable students to vote, that also matters.
When else in our lives will students have the importance of voting impressed on them more deeply than when their University takes concrete steps to make voting and poll-working logistically easier in a time of national crisis? What better time in our lives to ask us to wake up to the political realities of our nation and get involved in the never-ending, hard-but-sacred work of self-improvement by ballot? Without a real chance this time, we may never know.
Brown did it. Columbia’s been doing it (plus the Monday off) for years. Harvard, it’s our turn.

As I sunk my teeth into the slice of watermelon, my tongue recoiled. Even the sweltering summer heat couldn’t persuade me to enjoy my favorite fruit.
Just a week ago I had polished off the tubs of watermelon cubes my mother had cut up just the way I liked. It didn’t take long for me to finish an entire melon, shoving sweet, cool forkfuls of fruit in my mouth to sate my hunger and the weight of Seoul’s heat wave. My paternal grandmother had immediately taken note of my eating habits; soon enough, a pounding knock would shake my bedroom door each morning. I would open it to a plate of watermelon slices, the rind still attached, balanced on her walker. I would awkwardly smile, bow my head, say thank you, and then take the plate.
A random assortment of gifts followed: red-bean Hawaiian cookies she didn’t like, a pin, makeup someone had gifted her, castella cake, kiwis, peaches. The envelopes stuffed with cash, however, were the most burdensome. I would initially refuse, only to eventually accept them with both hands and shove them in the back of a drawer after my mother would nudge me, signaling that I was being rude. Each time I came to Korea, my grandmother would bid higher in an attempt to own my affections. She always lost, but only because they were never up for auction in the first place. Each time she tried, I felt like I had robbed someone, taking her money and failing to repay her with obsequiousness. My stubborn morals prevented me from becoming particularly skilled in the art of sucking-up. No matter how much my grandmother offered me, nothing could make up for for the way I saw her treat my mother. Nothing could auction my love.
I remember when the trailer for “The Farewell” first came out. Tears rolled down my cheeks as climactic indie music aggressively strummed to a series of images: a young Chinese-American woman mourning the cancer diagnosis of her grandmother, a Chinese family laughing at a dinner table, Awkwafina hugging her sweet, smiley grandmother. Finally,the music decrescendos as they happily practice tai chi together in the street. The illustration of such a cherished grandmotherly relationship only reminded me of what I was missing out on, of the love that seemingly everyone else got to experience.
Guilt would pulse in the back of my mind whenever someone would talk about how much they loved their grandmother. Every wad of cash I received, every plate of fruit offered, I felt myself being suffocated by this guilt that clogged the air I inhaled. Am I a horrible person for hating my grandmother? Should I feel ashamed of myself? She’s just a lonely old woman, I need to try harder. Such internal agonizing was compounded by my Korean peers in high school, who called me “disrespectful” and “a brat” whenever I criticized my grandmother. So every holiday when I went back to Korea, I tried. But even when I tried asking her about her past or striking up a personal conversation, my efforts were met with either apathy or a lecture.
Fostering a positive relationship with my grandmother was impossible because another relationship stood between us: that of my grandmother and my mother. It was how she treated her daughter-in-law, my mother, as if she were a second-class citizen. It was the emotional abuse screamed at my mother that seeped through the cracks of my bedroom door. It was the fact that she told my mother the only good thing about her existence was that she could take care of my grandmother’s only son. It was the lies and accusations about my mother that she fed to my aunts, ruining their relationships. It was the personal insults thrown at my mother’s family. It was the hiring of a private investigator to evaluate my mother’s history when she was dating my father. It was the threat to commit suicide if my mother married my father. It was the persistent banging on doors, the demands to receive money. It was the simple devaluation of my mother to a servant, a daughter-in-law.
As a Korean woman, taking care of her mother-in-law is a cultural duty my mother must fulfill. It’s her duty to cook for her, to drive her to the hospital, to wipe her ass if there’s an accident, to stand in silence as she endures the abuse. The same holds true for my mother’s friends, my aunt, my aunt’s friends, the woman next door, the woman next door’s friends. The suffering of a Korean daughter-in-law is, as my mother has said, “a universal struggle.” Upon the backs of the Korean woman rests the responsibility to care for every family member, even those she shares no blood relation to. The responsibility to stay silent and obedient, to make every and all sacrifices.
When it comes to elders, to defend yourself is disrespectful, to speak out is an atrocity, and to fight back is shameful. Respecting one’s elders is important. But when this indestructible ideology starts to restrict and define one’s life, humans are no longer humans. The expectation of such familial relationships causes my mother’s respect for my grandmother to manifest as servility, and my grandmother’s gratitude gives way to entitlement.
To my grandmother, my mother is an evil outsider. The villain that swept in and stole her son away. But to me, my mother is my mother. And after more than ten years of warily watching my mother and grandmother’s relationship from the sidelines, two years ago, I chose to break tradition, ignore culture, and speak up. I sat her down, and pleaded for her to treat my mother better, to stop hurting her so that she could stop hurting the both of us. Once, as I was leaving Korea, I left my grandmother with one final request: “Please don’t bother my mom.”
After that first breakthrough, I felt prepared to enter the battle at any time. It was not a battle between me and my grandmother, but a battle between me and culture. Older or not, mother-in-law or not, it was the battle about the notion that everyone deserves to be treated like a human being with respect. This past summer I quite literally begged my grandmother to be kind to my mother in the middle of another round of accusations.
Between the critiques of my mother, she leveled an accusation at me: “Just because you go to a good college doesn’t mean you know how to act.”
Maybe she was right. Maybe I was being an entitled brat for speaking back to an elder. Maybe my liberal arts education has given me a sense of superiority. But that’s not how I saw it. For years, my aunts were taught to be obedient, respectful wives. Between pottery, painting, and singing classes at the women’s university they attended was a hidden curriculum that emphasized docility, gentleness, subservience. Being educated meant one was versed in respect and social order. My voice was culturally unacceptable. I believe, however, the whole point of getting an education is to expand your thinking into one that enables gaining your own conscience and independence. It gives you the ability to fight for what is right despite convention.
Maybe it’s because I’m not Korean enough, or the American soil has poisoned me. But battling between culture and emotion, I’ve never once felt ashamed for having stood up for my mother.

What does it look like for two “anticapitalists” to run a business? Paradoxical, but possible. Made by Me — a paint-your-own-pottery studio run by queer women, in the process of selling ownership to its employees — is real, open for business, and located right on Mass. Ave.
“We joke about how we, anticapitalist human beings, are running a corporation. But I did have a friend saying that a paint-your-own-pottery shop is a long way from Jeff Bezos,” explains Made by Me’s vice president M. E. Lee with a laugh. The studio itself is a long way from an Amazon warehouse: The afternoon sun streams through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating pottery in various stages of completion. The shelves are stacked with clean white pieces, waiting to be selected and transformed by customers, and samples displaying children’s handprints and footprints hang on the walls. A group of ceramic figurines holding protest signs sits in the front window display, and completed pieces ready for pick up sit on a table near the front, glossy and bright after firing.
Over the past few months, Lee and her colleague, Amber Ostrander, have guided Made By Me through two major shifts: a change in ownership and corporate structure, and a change in business practices as a result of the pandemic.
The studio, originally called Clayroom North, was first opened by a family at its former location in Harvard Square in 1998. The previous owner, Bessie Blum, took over the studio in 2000, changed the name to Made by Me, and moved it to its current location on Mass. Ave. in 2003. Ever since, it has provided “a safe space for folx of all ages and identities to come to create, recharge, and have fun,” as per their website.
“Everybody remembers Harvard Square as it looked when they moved to Boston, and that’s the true Harvard Square,” Ostrander says. But new developments leave Cambridge looking different year after year, and Made by Me has felt the effects of this buildout. “It’s getting harder and harder to keep up as small businesses,” she adds. “Everything that’s being built is luxury.”
While the pandemic has slowed down their business, it has also provided them the opportunity to restructure, as the store is in the process of shifting to an employee-owned model.
In August, Blum, who owned the studio at that time, realized it was time for her to retire. She approached Ostrander, who’d been at the studio for five years, to see if she might be interested in purchasing it. She was.
Blum’s departure was bittersweet. “Bessie is like family, and this place has been really important to me in my own sort of personal journey,” Lee says.
Ostrander agrees, adding, “My dad was in the Air Force, so we moved a lot. I was in all these different cities and every time I would always find a place like this. So when I moved here and I needed just a part time job, I kind of just wandered in off the street, asked Bessie to hire me. And she did. And within the first year I was like, I could do this forever.”
Ostrander purchased the studio on Oct. 1, and once the paperwork is finalized, Lee and Ostrander will become co-owners. Given that Ostrander and Lee are the only full-time employees at the moment, Made By Me will then be effectively an employee-owned business.
Under an employee-owned model, which is used by only 0.3 percent of US businesses as of 2017, future employees can choose to buy into the company, though it is not a requirement for employment. Made By Me’s version of an employee-owned business has two job titles: Studio Artist and Creatrix.
“Studio Artists are non-shareholders, and a Creatrix is an owner,” Ostrander explains. “‘Creatrix’ is Latin for the divine feminine creator, which I thought was appropriate for our women-owned art studio, so we are incorporated as Creatrix Industries Inc.” An employee can purchase any number of shares to become either a partial owner, who earns a percent of surplus profit in relation to the number of shares held; a partner, who has an equal vote in decision making; or a Creatrix — their own boss.
“I think the community piece is really the anchor for [the employee-owned model] because we wanted the physical corporate structural model to reflect our values,” Lee says. Before the pandemic, Made By Me often partnered with community organizations: Patients from the Cambridge Eating Disorder Center and 3East, an adolescent dialectical behavior therapy program, would regularly come to paint.
Though they’re not currently able to host groups from the CEDC and 3East because of social distancing guidelines, Lee and Ostrander are still focused on maintaining their relationship with their community. Since June, Made By Me has offered “Port-A-Pottery” as a socially-distant way to offer pottery painting. Customers can pick up a kit that includes a piece to paint (the “Coffee Date” kit, for example, has two small latte mugs), as well as paints, paint brushes, and a palette. Once they’ve painted their pottery, customers drop it off to get fired and can pick up their work within a week.
When they can fill the studio to regular capacity again, Lee and Ostrander have plans for more theme nights and activities. “I think it would be so much fun to do a brunch-style event where everyone paints coffee mugs, and we can partner with a local coffee shop so that people can sample the coffee. When they come to pick up their fired mugs, it comes with the grounds of the coffee they were drinking,” Ostrander says. Other ideas include a “Wine and Cheese Board” night where customers can bring a bottle of wine and paint a cheese board, and a “Spaced Out” event where customers can learn how to paint galaxy designs.
“We’re here. How do I help? What else can we do for the community? Especially as the world continues to burn around us, and everything is on fire. How many people can’t afford therapy but can afford to paint a mug?” Ostrander says. “And it’s not at all a replacement — it’s a band-aid on a bullet hole — but it’s still a band-aid, you know, that's the best I can offer them.”

Singer-songwriter Emily L. Maguire begins each day by writing a poem. It’s a process that takes her no more than a few minutes. “By the time I finish [my] coffee it just falls out of my head,” she says. “My poetry is really automatic writing.” Poetry offers Maguire a way to deal with bouts of depression, during which songs are simply too difficult to write. The act of writing, she says, makes her feel more connected to the world.
Maguire is one of several artists collaborating with the UnLonely Project, an initiative of the Foundation for Art and Healing which aims to treat the “epidemic of loneliness” in the United States using creative arts as medicine.
The project is the brainchild of Jeremy J. Nobel, faculty member at Harvard Medical School and avid poet and photographer. It reflects Nobel’s intersecting interests in art and medicine, advocating creative expression as a treatment for loneliness, an issue its website calls a “public health concern.”
Nobel says the UnLonely Project’s goals are threefold: to increase public awareness of loneliness as a health problem, reduce stigma and facilitate conversation, and provide resources to help people cope.
Spreading awareness begins with what Nobel terms “loneliness literacy,” or defining what it means to experience loneliness. “Being lonely is the perception someone has of the gap between the social connection you would like to have, that you aspire to, that you desire, and the ones you actually feel you do have,” Nobel explains. This perceived gap varies from person to person: Someone may long for a crowd of acquaintances, while their neighbor may long for a single close friend.
Because of these differences, isolation doesn’t necessarily imply loneliness. “If you’re on Mars, and you have the universe's most powerful telescope that can see through walls, you could pick out the isolated people on planet Earth, but you could not pick out the lonely people,” Nobel says.
Maguire, who currently lives on a goat farm in the Australian bush, makes a similar distinction. She describes loneliness as suffering, while being alone can be “something incredibly precious.”
And loneliness can even be useful, Nobel says — in small doses. He draws an analogy between loneliness and thirst, both bodily signals. Whereas thirst prompts the body to hydrate, loneliness prompts the mind to connect. Ignoring this signal can cause sustained, severe loneliness, which may lead to serious health problems.
Though loneliness is difficult to quantify, survey data demonstrate its epidemic proportions: Loneliness afflicts more than one third of American adults, with the highest numbers concentrated in the 18 to 22-year-old demographic. The UnLonely Project’s website lists the negative effects of loneliness on both mental and physical health, including increased risk of depression, anxiety, dementia, heart disease, and cancer. All maladies considered, loneliness can increase mortality risk by 30 percent, a figure on par with smoking 15 cigarettes a day, according to the United States Health Resources and Services Administration.
The UnLonely Project encompasses a number of programs and initiatives. Its website contains programming for four specific categories: Aging, Campus, Community, and Workplace. Ongoing is the Fourth Annual UnLonely Film Festival, featuring free short films from award-winning filmmakers that are accompanied by activities and discussion boards to connect viewers.
The Project’s latest endeavor addresses a new flavor of loneliness exacerbated by COVID-19: that of widespread involuntary isolation. “Stuck at Home (Together),” a new page on the Foundation for Art and Healing website, presents artist spotlights, creative writing exercises, and mental health check-ins, among other things.
Creative arts as treatment for a medical issue might seem an unusual prescription. But for Nobel, the connection is clear. Whether writing a poem or drawing a cartoon, arts often provide an outlet for self-expression. This refreshing authenticity, when shared with another, can encourage a reciprocal vulnerability and spark a genuine connection. “Then it’s like an electric circuit gets closed, and you’re both connected,” he says.
For Maguire, who struggles with bipolar disorder, her art is a way of expressing “feelings that otherwise get stuck inside.” Her music also forges a genuine connection with her fans. “The healing really is for them,” she says. “They feel like I’ve understood their pain, what they’re going through.”
Loneliness can be intimidating, but Nobel advises approaching it with a mixture of curiosity and discipline. To explore feelings of isolation, he recommends “engaging with a piece of art,” whether it’s programming from his project or anything that inspires a creative response.
“You can just look at it and say: ‘Oh, what does this remind me of?’ Or: ‘What am I curious about here?’ And as small a step as that is, then you’re beginning to disclose something. You’re engaging. And if you share it, even better.”
The rest, Nobel says, is daily practice: “Exercise some deliberate self-care and try to be more connected. Almost like flossing your teeth, you know. ‘I’m going to connect today.’”
Maguire suggests an alternative approach: a Buddhist meditation practice called Tonglen. “You say to yourself, ‘There are millions and millions of people in the world who are feeling exactly what I’m feeling right now,’” she explains. “You breathe in their pains, and then you breathe out and you send them your love.”
Nobel concludes with an example of a simple act of sharing that inspired connection in his own life. He recalls photographing gorgeous sunsets from his time at a writing retreat, noting that while the view itself was enjoyable, “sending [the photos] to people and getting their response was every bit and in some ways even more gratifying.” He urges us to take small risks like these, to maintain a sense of humor and stop worrying about the possibility of failure — in this case, not receiving a response. “People are busy,” he admits, “but it doesn’t mean they don’t care about you or your picture.”
Still, he chooses to err on the side of optimism: “Almost guaranteed, they’re going to respond, and then you’re going to feel something. And my guess is what you’re going to feel is more connected.”

There is typically an organized chaos that undergirds visiting Salem, Mass. in October, when the town hosts its series of Halloween-themed programming. Parking is expensive, but still available. You push through the crowd, but the crowd moves in a particular direction: toward the haunted houses, the Salem Witch Museum, and all the other spooky sights and attractions. You might find yourself lost among that crowd, separated from the people you came with, but the crowd is just a crowd and you’ll find your way back to your friends. Now a crowd isn’t just a crowd: It’s a coronavirus outbreak waiting to happen.
This is the fear of Salem residents in 2020, especially those who work in the town’s tourism sector. The town has tried to move all of its regular Halloween scheduling online — advising people to postpone their travel plans until next year and expending time and money to create virtual alternatives — in an effort to thwart the spread of COVID-19. But tourists have been coming to partake in the town’s haunting history nonetheless: What Salem is seeing this year isn’t organized chaos — it’s chaos-chaos.
“We’re seeing lines for up to an hour, an hour-and-a-half wait to get into some of the shops,” says Kate L. Fox, the director of Destination Salem, Salem’s main tourist company. “A surprising number of people are coming to Salem in the middle of a pandemic.”
In the last few weeks, Fox recalls, the center of Salem was full of huge crowds. She says that in the town center, “people were shoulder to shoulder and really cramped as they were looking for things to do.” Most planned programming for the Halloween season has moved online, so all there is for tourists to do in the town is shop and eat. This is further complicated when one considers, as Fox notes, that shops and restaurants can only have a limited number of customers inside or seated per table at a time.
“We are going to see new restrictions in the next three weeks, especially around that area of Salem where we’re not gonna be able to allow as many people in,” Fox says.
As scary as the physical streets of Salem have been, full as they are of tourists flaunting social distancing guidelines, this year’s virtual Salem programming has maintained the more jovial terror that has made the town famous. It’s a terror not of viruses, but of witches.
In 1692, amid King William’s War and a smallpox epidemic, tensions in Salem were high. In January of that year, three girls from wealthy and respected families began having fits and, under pressure from the town magistrates, claimed that they were possessed by the devil. They alleged that three women — one a Carribean slave, one a homeless beggar, and one an impoverished old woman — were the ones responsible for their possession, which they had brought about by witchcraft. A ripple of hysteria over witches overwhelmed Salem, sending 19 victims to the gallows and one to be pressed to death by stones.
Since then, Salem’s frightening past has intrigued people from all over the globe. A typical year brings in hundreds of thousands of visitors and generates about 140 million dollars in revenue, Fox says. Usually October is the busiest month and Halloween the biggest night of the year. The town erects stages to feature local DJs and live music; later in the evening, it lights fireworks. This year, since Halloween falls on both a Saturday and a full moon, the town was expecting upwards of 100,000 visitors.
Instead, Salem has made their Haunted Happenings programming virtual, creating a stream of more accessible events. Their program includes a virtual marketplace, parades, contests, and magic shows. Usually a Christmas event, Salem is offering its annual house tours as a part of the virtual Haunted Happenings programming, but this time featuring Salem’s very own witch, Borah.
When you log on to the tour, Borah greets you from within his home and takes you from house to house through his spellbook. The spellbook is really just a series of videos you click through, not unlike skipping throughout a YouTube playlist. A highlight is the House of Seven Gables, a 1668 colonial mansion built for the family of John Turner. The house was made famous by
Nathaniel Hawthorne in his 1851 novel of the same name. Hawthorne was a Salem native and descendent of John Hathorne, the only judge of the Salem Witch Trials to never repent his actions.
Although tourists may not be able to enter the houses in the flesh — it would be impossible, with coronavirus guidelines, to allow 2,000 people to walk through the old mansions — they’re still able to participate in the spookiness. On Halloween night, they can open their laptop from the safety of their bedrooms (or, for Harvard students on campus, their dorms), visit each house by clicking from one video to the next, and once the tour is complete, they can close their laptops, look at their windows, and see the full moon. Salem might not be safe to visit this year, but its spookiness is still remains. You can howl at the full moon from any corner of the globe — or, better yet, you can hop on Zoom with your friends and together you can howl at the glow of your laptop screens.

I realized it in late April: I am about to be at home for a very long time. Having spent a month doing coursework mostly on my bed, I decide I need to set up a desk environment — so I remove all the papers from my never-really-used desk, move it to face the window, and order a monitor, keyboard, and mouse from Best Buy.
I am looking up ergonomic desk setup tutorials on YouTube when I see a thumbnail featuring a huge, curved screen in my sidebar recommendations. I click on it. The video, by a British physician named Ali Abdaal, is titled "My Productivity Desk Setup" and has over one million views. It is fascinating — it features a 49-inch 5K monitor ($1500) with a mount that makes it appear to float in midair, a desk that changes its height with a press of a button, a stool designed so that you must engage your core to stay upright, and a mini palm tree. The setup is ridiculous and excessive and beautiful, and I cannot stop listening to Ali Abdaal’s commentary — “I’ve been fantasizing about, you know, having the perfect desk since I was five years old,” he says — as he goes through item after item that I will never purchase. I’m confused by why I’m watching this, but I can’t stop.
After watching this first video, I go on his channel, which, according to his banner, focuses on the broad themes of “Productivity, Tech, Lifestyle.” I click on video after video as he talks about his seven note-taking apps and tells me how to study, how to get better at investing, how to type faster, and as he puts it, how to stop being a “complete wasteman.”
***
This is how, in the early phases of the pandemic, I stumble upon the productivity side of YouTube. Over the last seven months, I have somehow found myself spending more time watching videos that tell me how to optimize my life — how to take notes, stack habits, sleep better, focus on work — than ever before.
YouTubers of this genre call it “self development,” and the three main people that seem to dominate it are Thomas Frank, Ali Abdaal, and Matt D’Avella. Their videos have titles like “A Day in the Life of a Minimalist” and “How to Wake up Before 6am Every Day” to “How I Take notes on my iPad Pro in medical school” to “How to Stop Being TIRED All The Time.”
The titles are clickbait, but the content is reasonable. Thomas Frank’s advice for being less tired is what your mom would tell you: Get enough sleep, go outside, exercise, drink less coffee, drink more water. Matt D’Avella tells you that to stop procrastinating, you should tell yourself that you’ll work on the task for thirty minutes; often, he says, you’ll unconsciously work on it for more than thirty minutes, and sometimes the momentum will lead you to finish the task altogether.
Some of these tips feel self explanatory, but the reasons they give aren’t. In fact, all of the advice relies on the assumption that we tend to overestimate our ability to make good judgments for ourselves — like how much we are inclined to procrastinate or misestimate the amount of sleep we really need. The YouTube videos, many of which are sourced from pop psychology books like “Atomic Habits” by James Clear or “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker, tell us how to trick our brains so that they function the way we want them to function, neatly packaged into a ten-minute video. All we have to do is watch these short videos to become, as Ali Abdaal puts it, “happier, healthier, and more productive versions of ourselves.”
***
Even though I’m not usually embarrassed by my consumption habits (I recently sent my friends a photo of a bed captioned “my hotel in Wyoming has these Wyoming shaped pillows”), nothing feels quite as bad as watching these YouTube videos.
There is something about watching self-development content that feels embarrassing, even though I know it shouldn’t be. When I watch a video called “How to Make Yourself Study when you have ZERO motivation,” I feel like I’ve lost my autonomy: my ability to figure things out for myself, to turn around difficult moments independently.
I still find myself feeling this way, even though I thought I had already learned my lesson freshman fall — when I turned in incomplete problem sets because I didn’t know it was normal to ask for help. I thought I learned that over-valuing one’s autonomy, even in our ultra individualistic society, is an extremely naive thing to do.
During the pandemic, I’ve found myself more and more open to this type of content — people on the internet telling me how to do things I previously thought I did just fine myself — than before.
Perhaps it’s because, over the past few months, I’ve been acutely aware of what the words “autonomy” and “freedom” mean, how the feeling of autonomy doesn’t always coincide with the actual possession of it. Some people refuse to wear masks in public places because they want their “autonomy,” their freedom to do what they want to do. But isn’t real autonomy the freedom from being infected with COVID-19 when you go grocery shopping, and the freedom from infecting your family, too?
Maybe I hesitate when YouTube videos with clickbait titles designed to drive up ad revenue tell me what to do. But I spent most of April frustrated at how hard it was to do the things I really wanted to do — instead, I doomscrolled through the news on Twitter for hours, lost the ability to respond to messages in socially acceptable time frames, read fiction instead of working on my schoolwork, became weeks behind on problem sets. It felt as if the constant news cycle and being home 24/7 reset years of acquired knowledge on maintaining executive function. I tried all of my previous strategies for getting back on track, but they weren’t sufficient anymore.
Foregoing guidance because you want to feel self-sufficient is not real autonomy — real autonomy is instead the ability to choose what you want to do with your time, and follow through with it. I know I didn’t have real autonomy over my time in April. Was it really that bad to watch a few ten-minute videos that would help me wrest back control of my own time, my own life, so I could spend my time the way I wanted to?
***
What keeps me watching, however, is the curious entertainment value of these videos.
The difference between pop psychology books (which I have also read in large quantities) and pop psychology YouTube is that YouTube lets you see people try things on themselves in real time, like when Matt D’Avella spends 30 days taking only cold showers. The idea of cold showers, he says, is getting over something called the “flinch”: the “moments when you shrink up before a big moment,” he says. The “flinch” that you have right before getting into a cold shower is analogous to the flinch you have right before speaking to a large audience or having a difficult conversation with your partner. “You need to build up a habit of seeing the flinch and going forward, not rationalizing your fear and stepping away,” he says.
And so he films his face as he steps in the shower each day, giving commentary in between clips. One day, he measures the water temperature. “Had to see how cold this shit really is,” he says. “This shit’s got to be 40 degrees. I got a cooking thermometer right now, I’m going to do an actual test.” The water is actually 61 degrees.
“I think it’s broken; there’s probably something wrong,” he jokes.
Each YouTube video is like a small experiment; you either watch other people conduct it or are given the necessary steps to conduct it on yourself. I suspect this is why these productivity YouTubers got into productivity in the first place, given their rejection of the belief that you must constantly be productive (they’re all really into work-life balance and taking breaks) and their relative openness about their own selves.
Matt D’Avella has a video about his anxiety, where he admits that it’s a lot harder to talk about ongoing difficulties than past difficulties he’s overcome. Ali Abdaal has enough followers for companies to send him a free $1500 monitor to feature in his videos, but in his “What’s On My iPhone 11 Pro Max” video, he shows us his Hinge and Tinder profiles for us to critique. “I’m still single, so I need all the help I can get,” he says.
Like cooking, about which there is a seemingly infinite number of YouTube videos, productivity is another experiment. There is a wide range of tools you can use to feel more in control of your life, and it is fun to try all of them to find the one that works best for you: from the trusty strategy of distancing yourself from your phone as much as possible to avoid using it during the day, to new note-taking apps that encourage “networked thought,” to time-tracking software, to the absurdities of a $1500 monitor (it turns out that apparently large screens make you more productive).
When you are deprived of real human interaction at home, when your day-to-day has been the same for seven months, it is fun to watch people on the internet live their lives in ways that are so irrelevant to yours. When you’ve spent your nth hour on your bed watching TikToks, it is comforting to know that there are proven ways for you to stop and that people on the internet will show you how to do it. When the pandemic has wrenched away control of your life, it is soothing to watch “Study With Me - A Super Productive Day”; perhaps the veneer of someone exercising control over their lives (“at 8 a.m. I decide to stop being a complete wasteman and get up to start the day”) shows you that maybe you can take back your autonomy, and do what they do, too.
***
I’ve noticed that now, in late October, I don’t really watch these videos anymore. Personal development content on YouTube may have been another one of my random periodic hobbies, like online coffee forums or watching political ads from years ago. I get really into something, and once I exhaust enough of the content, move on.
It turns out that I do have much more control over my time now than I did in April. It’s unclear how much the actual content in these videos contributed, but I did enjoy how entertaining they were, and I no longer feel bad for watching them. Maybe that’s enough. I’m never going to willingly spend 30 days taking cold showers, after all, but I didn’t think that the purpose of that video was to make us copy him anyway.
In a way, it all still seems trivial. Despite what effective altruists might say, it’s hard to listen to people telling me to focus on self development — and it feels selfish to even think about it — when over a million people have died in the past seven months from COVID-19. But I still ended up consuming this content, and probably still will, to some extent, in the future, and I am not sure why. Maybe it is for the entertainment value, maybe because of the fascinating and almost scientific way some people try to optimize their own lives, or the pop psychology of it all. But in a time where everything is uncertain, why wouldn’t you want to listen to someone tell you what to do, promising a better, more fulfilling life if you follow along?

Leaves of paint tessellate a young woman’s face as she looks straight ahead. The word “Milagro” jumps out in light pink, surrounded by a murky sea of blue. “Milagro” is a soon-to-be-published chapbook, a small collection of poetry, written by Penelope M. Alegria ’24.
Originally from the Chicago area, Alegria moved to the suburbs when she was 12 years old. “It was a really big shift. I used to go to this all-Hispanic bilingual school and then, suddenly, I moved into this predominantly white high school,” Alegria says. She turned to writing to “sort through” complicated feelings over her new situation, “but they weren’t really poems.”
Alegria first fell in love with poetry in the eighth grade. During a lesson on slam poetry, her teacher showed the class a documentary called “Louder Than a Bomb,” which follows four slam teens as they traverse a competition. Slam poetry is a competition-based form of spoken word poetry that often involves energetic and dramatic performances before live audiences. Louder Than a Bomb is the largest youth poetry festival in the world, bringing over 500 youth poets together to perform, workshop, and learn. “I just looked at that and I was like: I want to do that. I want to be on that stage. If they can do it, why can’t I?” Alegria says.
Alegria later joined her high school’s slam team. “The first time I went to a slam poetry meeting, they just ripped my poem apart — it was terrible,” she says. “But it was really good that they did that. I had never gotten criticism like that before.”
Throughout high school, Alegria sought out further opportunities. She turned to Young Chicago Authors, a nonprofit that offers creative writing programming for teens and adults; it also organizes the annual “Louder Than a Bomb” festival. There, she attended intensive summer writing workshops where she worked to hone her craft. The “intensives” were led by poetry mentors Kevin Coval, the founder of “Louder Than a Bomb,” and Jamila Woods, acclaimed singer-songwriter-poet. “It was through those writing workshops that I ended up coming up with a lot of my poems,” she says.
Every year, the Young Chicago Authors organization selects a new Chicago Youth Poet Laureate from the students in their artistic programs to serve as an ambassador. The Chicago Youth Poet Laureate develops a chapbook in collaboration with Haymarket Books, an independent, nonprofit publishing offshoot of the Center for Economic Research and Social Change.
When Alegria was named Chicago’s Youth Poet Laureate for 2019-2020, the organizers told her “that Haymarket Books would be committed to publishing my chapbook by the end of the year,” she says. This offered a chance for Alegria to consolidate all the poems she’d written since her freshman year into one place.
The chapbook, titled “Milagro” — Alegria’s middle name, which is Spanish for miracle — recounts her parents’ immigration from Peru to the United States through their perspectives as well as her own. The chapbook reflects on the generational consequences of immigration, emphasizing Alegria’s experiences as a first-generation American.
“Originally, I wanted my collection to be about my mom and retelling family stories through her perspective, but when I sat down to write the collection, I didn’t want my chapbook to just be about that,” she says. Alegria still aimed to explore her own experiences in her work, and the chapbook eventually extended beyond a collection “exclusively about [her] mother.”
For Alegria, publishing “Milagro” is more than just another accomplishment — it’s a milestone. Growing up in a household without cable meant that she relied heavily on books for entertainment throughout her childhood “I always wanted to write something and have it be out in the world,” she says. “I was thinking of self-publishing, but I didn’t know how to navigate that space. When I got the opportunity to publish it through Haymarket, it was just — it’s very surreal to hold something that you created in your hands. It’s been wonderful.”
Beyond the publication of “Milagro,” Alegria’s tenure as the Chicago Youth Poet Laureate has exposed her to various opportunities to share her work. Last October, she was invited to perform at the Obama Foundation summit. “I usually don’t get nervous for gigs, but I was really, really nervous,” she says. At the dress rehearsal, she forgot her lines. “I was panicking. I was like: ‘I memorized this. I don’t understand why it’s not coming out of my mouth.’”
Despite her momentary stage fright, Alegria made it through the performance. Co-performing with a close friend and collaborating with Chicago’s Joffrey Ballet Company made the event especially memorable. “We got to interact with some dancers and create this visual interpretation of the poem, which was really awesome to see,” she says.
Despite juggling classes and extracurriculars during these chaotic times, Alegria has continued to do what she loves. Currently, she is a contributing writer for TheCrimson’s Arts Board, where she recently began a poetry column called “Hers.” She envisions “Hers” as a series of poems centering the experiences of her mother. “It’s more in line with what the original collection was supposed to be for the chapbook,” she says. Alegria has also begun stepping out of her comfort zone and “branch[ing] out into other literary genres like screenwriting and prose.”
When asked about her most memorable performance, Alegria recalls a poem she wrote as a sophomore in high school about her father getting pulled over on the South Side of Chicago. The poem is titled “Papa’s Deli Order,” and it details her father’s experience as an immigrant struggling to understand English.
“I translate all of my poems for my parents because they don’t understand English,” she says. “I translated [“Papa’s Deli Order”] into Spanish, and they saw me perform it after they understood what the poem was about, and I remember them crying after.”
For Alegria, poetry offers a lens by which to understand a complex sea of feelings. “Poetry has given me a space to explore who I am,” she says. “I felt a lot of pressure from my parents that I had to be something because they immigrated here for me. I felt like I had to pay back a debt and I didn’t really know if anybody else felt the same.”
“To speak my thoughts into existence — there’s something really comforting about putting what’s in your head on the page.”

What does it mean to be a Republican in 2020?
According to many in the Harvard Republican Club, the answer is very different than it was four years ago.
Those part of the group in 2016 remember it as a community open to “anyone right of Marx.” Older members describe an emphasis on friendly, intellectual discussion and a legacy of female presidents and gender parity.
“I would say I never felt not included,” said Sapna V. Rampersaud ’19, who joined the club her freshman year. Moderate and left-leaning people were welcome at meetings and events, she remembers. She “never noticed that there was any sort of tension related to difference in opinion.”
This was the same year HRC chose not to endorse Donald Trump, after a club-wide poll of members revealed 80 percent weren’t planning on voting for him.
Last month, that same club held another vote on the current president — but this time it looked very different. HRC hosted a Zoom forum open to first-years and those who had attended previous meetings, but only the executive board was allowed to vote. According to several participants who spoke to Fifteen Minutes, the meeting was sparsely attended, and the majority of those present were board members.
In the final vote, the club split along gendered lines: Two women who has served on the board were also the only two people to vote against a Trump endorsement. Reversing their 2016 stance, HRC chose to endorse Donald J. Trump.
No one outside the group seems to know the full composition of the club’s voting board members. HRC’s list of officers on The Hub, the College’s student organization registry, names only four people. Postings on The Hub are rarely accurate, however, and interviews with board members suggested that HRC’s leadership was much larger than just four students. Those interviewed declined to reveal the total number, so it’s difficult to know exactly how many voted in favor of Trump.
Several days after their Zoom forum, the club announced its decision to endorse the President in a written statement posted on their Facebook page, earning backlash from many within and outside of the Harvard conservative community. The statement itself received 49 comments, and many students took to Instagram to condemn the club’s decision.
So how did HRC go from denouncing Trump’s “racial slander” as a “threat to the survival of the Republic” in 2016, to lauding the president in 2020 as creating “the most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans” and “peace worldwide”?
The Harvard Republican Club has historically been a close-knit group. Grace K. Bannister ’21, a member since her freshman year, fondly recalled a “big tent” community where it was “easy to make friends” and club members often got together in the Quincy House dining hall to “just hang out and talk.” Bannister previously served as the club’s Vice President of Socials, hoping to provide community and foster a better relationship with the Harvard Democrats Club, even leading a joint fundraiser.
After 2016, however, Bannister could feel that “big tent” community beginning to change. She and other older members of HRC discussed a range of factors in the rise of a “pro-Trump faction.”
The first indicator that this faction was gaining power was the outcome of the club’s 2017 leadership elections, which Bannister described as marked by “Harvard snakery, to like, the millionth degree.” Members leveled allegations of voter suppression, and after allying themselves with the John Adams Society, those in favor of Trump’s presidency purportedly registered many people outside the club to vote in HRC board elections.
“It was the first time the Trumpy members tried to do a power grab,” Bannister said, adding that many HRC members left over the internal politics and infighting. “After that, there were so few members in the club that the board basically elected themselves for the next two years." HRC’s current president, Wesley L. Donhauser ’21, confirmed that his election as President was uncontested.
Another, more simple potential explanation for the shifting attitude toward Trump was suggested by a former HRC president. “We really thought he was going to lose.”
But following larger trends in the club and party as a whole, nearly every person interviewed independently cited the shift to a virtual community in light of the pandemic — a community centered around a contentious GroupMe — as a final tipping point. As Bannister put it, pro-Trump members were “coming out of the woodwork.”
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, HRC’s group chat wasn’t particularly active; older interviewees said that some would occasionally share an article and facilitate discussion. But at the beginning of quarantine, they saw a shift almost immediately.
“Right off the bat,” one HRC board member said, a couple of people started “dominating the dynamic of the GroupMe.” She’d been involved for three years, and though she said that historically “[HRC] members all knew each other,” many of the most vocal participants in the chat were now people she had never met. One was someone she’d never known was a fellow board member, though he quickly became a “loud, outspoken voice” that she speculated “made people scared to share their opinions.”
Bannister similarly described the club’s central group chat as being “hijacked by a few voices” — many of whom she’d never known in her four years in HRC. “I think that a lot of people felt a lot more comfortable behind a screen saying things in support of Trump than they would to somebody's face on campus.”
In one group chat conversation, a recently-graduated senior expressed criticism of Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. He shared that he was a former “single issue voter on the matter of abortion,” but doubted Barrett would actually overturn Roe v. Wade. It was more important to him that she would “do a lot of things I don’t like to healthcare, voting rights, environmental protections, etc.”
“Brave of you to post in the lion’s den,” one person responded to him.
Most other comments, however, were negative. One person dismissed his concerns about the way Barrett would rule as “straw man arguments,” calling them “assuming” and “dull.”
Another member responded by directly tagging the Barrett critic in messages like, “How are you so dense” and “Contraception is wack but y’all ain’t ready for that conversation.”
With fewer women in the group chat at the time, the men led the conversation. “Your access to contraceptives is unrestricted,” one joked, seeming to reference the fact that the writer concerned about abortion rights was a man. (All of the named commenters were men, as were eight of the ten participants in the conversation.)
As the group chat grew louder and more “combative,” in Bannister’s words, many veteran members chose to mute the chat or leave entirely.
“I’ve tried to respond, and I’ve just been told I’m stupid,” said an HRC board member who spoke to Fifteen Minutes on the condition of anonymity. She now hopes to completely disaffiliate from the club. The loud voices were taking over, she explained. “They were destroying us.”
When Grace Bannister opened the Zoom link for HRC’s endorsement forum, she wasn’t particularly optimistic. Looking at the call’s participants, she “already knew what was going to happen.”
By the time the forum was advertised — over email and in the club’s acrimonious group chat — many of the members who identified as moderate conservatives, like Austin B. Barclay ’22, had already grown “disillusioned.” Oluwatobi I. Ariyo ’22, another former member, believed “it was very purposely done that [the forum] wasn’t as well publicized.” Bannister agreed: “Had this thing been better publicized and had people not been so upset with what was happening in the group chat, there would have been more turnout,” she said.
In an interview on the endorsement, club President Wesley L. Donhauser ’21 disputed their criticisms. He said the club held the forum because “we wanted to give everyone a chance to have their voice heard.”
But for the two people on the call whose “voices” weren’t pro-Trump, it wasn’t quite that easy.
“It was nerve-wracking to be one of the only people saying ‘I don't believe this,’ when everybody was just like echo-chambering themselves,” Bannister recounted. It was the tenor of the conversation, however, that surprised her the most.
At one point she remembered being told she should be ready to debate any argument she made. The personalities, she felt, had grown very “Trumplike.” “People were in a fighting mood that night,” she recalled. “It wasn’t the group that I had joined as a freshman.” When Bannister would begin speaking, she’d get a lot of comments in the chat: Many called her a “RINO” (Republican In Name Only) or encouraged her to join the Harvard Democrats.
If Bannister — a four-year member of the club, who worked for two Republican lawmakers and the Republican Governors’ Association — isn’t Republican enough, who is?
The only other person who voted against the endorsement similarly described the meeting’s climate as “vicious.”
“It definitely was a bunch of guys ganging up on us,” she said of the forum. “It felt very targeted.” Despite her position on the executive board, she too was called a “fake Republican.” Notably, she remembered the messages seeking to “shut down her opinions” came from the Zoom chat, rather than direct verbal confrontation.
When asked if HRC still held a spectrum of opinions, Donhauser answered there were “quite a few” members left in the club who disagreed with the endorsement.
But the former board member thought differently: “I think it’s sealed that that’s not the case.”
In 2016, HRC’s public statement announced a “refusal” to endorse Trump, describing him as a “dangerous man,” who was “poisoning our country and our children,” and “eschewing basic human decency.” The words of these undergraduates reached CNN, NBC and the Washington Post.
The statement’s writers claim to be “ashamed” of Trump and his “racist slander.” After the club denounced Trump, it saw at least 130 potential new members attend an introductory meeting, compared to only 3o during the year prior.
By contrast, HRC’s 2020 endorsement points out Trump’s campaign promises to “Win the Race to 5G and Establish a National High-Speed Wireless Internet Network,” “To Continue to Lead the World in Access to the Cleanest Drinking Water and Cleanest Air,” and to “Hold China Fully Accountable for Allowing the Virus to Spread around the World” as critical components of the rationale behind their support of him.
The statement’s formal list of Trump’s accomplishments included three sections: foreign policy, his work on trade, and a final section on “Black Americans,” which drew the most criticism. “It is our sincere belief that the policies of the Republican party and President Trump would lead to the most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans,” the third heading read.
Below that heading, however, the bulleted points hardly mentioned “Black Americans.” Instead, they highlighted policies that would generate “private capital investment for disadvantaged communities” without explaining whether there exists a distinction between the categories of “Black” and “disadvantaged.” A later point on criminal justice reform couched Trump’s policies in colorblind rhetoric, praising a push toward “equity for all Americans” without mentioning a disparate racial impact.
Within Harvard’s conservative community, the statement was met with backlash.
“It’s very clear that people who ideologically or morally disagree with the president were not involved,” Barclay said, highlighting their list of cons as “paltry” and “absurd.” The statement’s section on “The President’s shortcomings” made up only 11 percent of the overall word count.
“I fail to understand how that was their list, unless they completely removed ideological dissent,” he continued, arguing that support of Trump is now the club’s standard.
Who then, was involved? “I think Wes just wrote it all on a Google Doc and posted it in the smaller GroupMe and said people were welcome to make suggestions by DMing him or commenting on the doc over a period of 24 hrs,” a former board member familiar with the process wrote in a texted statement.
Donhauser corroborated that account when asked for comment, saying he attempted to “aggregate” club members’ general feelings in writing the statement. “As President it is my job (for better or worse sometimes!) to handle media engagements,” he wrote.
After the statement was released, multiple members disaffiliated, claiming that the group no longer represented their values.
Following the Zoom forum, one former board member still hoped that the statement’s critique section could be “pretty decent.” But “seeing the ‘we think Trump is the best option for Black people’” section was the final straw, she recalled. She wanted to remove her name from everything associated with HRC; the current group no longer represents her views at all.
She and other HRC members had “donated to Black Lives Matter” and expressed “solidarity” on social media, she said. To her, these actions signaled politically that they acknowledged the existence of racism. But for other people in the group, she continued, “It’s like, ‘racism is fake.’”
When asked to comment on concerns about racism within HRC, Donhauser responded that “Racism is something that we take very seriously. It’s something that exists and should be condemned at every corner.”
Fifteen Minutes reached out to numerous other members of the group, including all known board members and affiliates who support the current president. None agreed to provide comment on their role in the vote or statement.
On Facebook, there’s only one comment on the first screenshot of the statement.
“did you ask any black people LMAO.”
Oluwatobi I. Ariyo ’21 came into Harvard a proud conservative. His freshman year, Ariyo penned a widely-read opinion piece for The Crimson titled “Cry from A Lone Conservative.” In it, he criticized an “echo chamber culture where expression of differing opinions is met by hostility.” Harvard, as he saw it, was a school with an “overwhelming liberal majority” where he felt “silenced” and “marginalized” for speaking his mind as a conservative student.
In an interview recently, Ariyo thought back to that op-ed. His former thesis — that liberal colleges are characterized by intolerance for differing perspectives — is a “mantra that conservatives on college campuses really speak to,” he said. But now, he’d say HRC is guilty of that same intolerance.
“It was interesting to see the club that I was in turn into the echo chamber we often denigrate.”
As one of the club’s few Black members, Ariyo described feeling an acute “lack of empathy” for his lived experience. When he spoke up in the club’s chat after the killing of George Floyd, he said his ideas were always “shut down.” “It’d just be like: The numbers say this; Trump’s not racist. The numbers say Black people are killed as much as white people per capita, so there’s no racial problem in the police system. Full stop,” he said.
Ariyo eventually left the chat. “I didn’t feel comfortable being used almost as a token.”
“When I published my op-ed, I was getting all these comments from people in the club being like ‘Oh that’s amazing,’” Ariyo remembered. The same was true this past year, as he tried to start a conservative newspaper on campus. “And then when I bring up something that makes me feel uncomfortable, it’s like my opinion no longer matters.”
As he reflected on his experiences in HRC, Ariyo made his mind up that this wasn’t just a problem with one college Republican club. Rather, he said the tokenization he experienced was “more endemic of the party as a whole.”
“It’s a matter of optics in my opinion,” he continued. “Minority lives matter only as long as they stay in line.”
“The Republican Party loves to showcase their few minority conservatives,” he went on. At times, people were eager to hear what I had to say.” Things were different, though when he spoke up after the death of George Floyd.
“All of a sudden, it’s silent. And you’re alone.”

Not getting a job, Kim Nguyen ’21 tells herself, doesn’t make you a bad person.
By the time we speak in late October, recruiting season is coming to a close. The leaves in Cambridge have shifted from green to red, but most members of the class of 2021 haven’t witnessed their last Harvard autumn firsthand. They’re at home in their childhood bedrooms, or renting an apartment with friends. Meanwhile, marathons of interviews have passed, and job offers have been made.
“When I get rejected from things, sometimes I let that affect how I view myself,” Nguyen says. “Because if you don’t have a job, and you have no idea what you’re doing after college, that’s sad.”
When Nguyen began the recruiting process, she thought she had a good sense of what to expect: emailing in some resumes, answering “Stat 110”-esque questions, and mostly “winging the interviews.”
Nguyen plans to eventually attend graduate school to study math, because above all, she appreciates when “people engage in a problem-solving process, and find a cool solution cool.” But right now, she’s looking to work for a few years in quantitative finance. She’s interested in “slightly tech-y, nerdy, math-y places” — companies that care more about problem-solving, than just “[changing a] parameter, and suddenly, [making] a ton more money.”
“And I kind of just want to have something that’s enough for me to pay rent and eat food,” she says. “And also enjoy my job enough.”
Among her friends who’d done recruiting in previous years, she has witnessed an arduous — yet “kind of fun” — process. At Harvard, the recruiting process is dominated by the finance, consulting, and tech industries, and the main thrust of the hiring process takes place in August, September, and October.
The first aspect of Nguyen’s recruiting process that differed from expectation was her summer internship.
“My internship last summer was completely virtual. I’m a person who, if someone’s not watching me, people would think I just disappear,” she says. “I had to make it a point of telling my manager how much I work every day, and that was just really weird.”
Nguyen didn’t end up getting a return offer from the company she interned for. This news was frustrating: She now had to enter into a shaky job market without an option to fall back on. She says that while she doesn’t know if she would have gotten the internship in a “normal” year, the “factor of [it being a] virtual internship was a lot weirder than a not-virtual internship.”
And so, Nguyen — alongside many of her classmates — embarked on a journey in virtual recruiting.
At Harvard College, a majority of students participate in the recruiting process for the finance, technology, and consulting industries; in 2020, 63 percent of the graduating class reported entering one of these three fields in The Crimson’s Exit Survey.
The vast majority of college students in the United States graduate without a clear plan; it takes the average college student three to six months to find a job after graduation. At Harvard, by contrast, it isn’t uncommon to know your future place of employment months in advance.
“No matter who you are, if you come to Harvard, you’re privileged. You have these opportunities to talk to firms that will only talk to Harvard students or Yale students, such as BCG,” Joshua H. Berry ’21 says. Berry, a former Crimson business associate, says that the major consulting firms simply don’t visit the campuses of his friends who attend state schools in New York. “We’re very lucky in that even during COVID-19, these consulting companies are still coming to campus,” he adds.
Berry believes Harvard makes its students an implicit “promise”: “If you come to our school, we promise you that you’ll have a great education, and that with this education, you’ll be able to get almost any job you want,” he says.
Put differently, he feels that Harvard promotes the idea that by attending the school, students will be able to sidestep the uncertainty and discomfort that many other students face once they graduate college and enter the job market.
This promise was never accessible to all students: Even with the efforts of the Office of Career Services (OCS) and the Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship to level the playing field, the Harvard employment landscape inevitably privileges certain students over others. And the pandemic has further circumscribed the University’s ability to uphold its end of the bargain. When the tech, finance, and consulting industries are put under pressure, the playing field becomes even less equitable, hurting those without family connections, social privilege, and advanced pre-professional experience.
The Harvard “promise” was never available to everyone, but the pandemic in many ways has shattered that notion.
Akanksha D. Sah ’21, the president of Harvard Student Agencies, always wanted to work in the public sector.
“I actually knew that I wanted to go into child advocacy since I was, well, a child,” she says, motivated by an interest in resolving “some of the inefficiencies” of the foster care system. While she believes she could make a much higher salary by entering a more lucrative industry — as many of her peers at HSA elect to do — the lower pay is worth it to her.
The pandemic has made the choice harder, though.
“We went from having room and board paid for and covered by Harvard through financial aid to, all of a sudden, I’m paying my own rent, I buy my own groceries, at a time when I had been planning on saving all of my income,” she says.
Students are “trying to figure out whether it’s even financially possible to go into the public sector,” she continues. “But if you can’t afford to do it, you just can’t afford to do it.”
While Sah herself has not been discouraged from pursuing a career in public service, her situation illuminates how finances can pressure students to pursue certain careers over others.
One Harvard office that is attempting to open students up to public service careers, in spite of those financial pressures, is the Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship.
The Center seeks to foster student interest in public service careers — but often finding opportunities that are “financially competitive for students” poses a major challenge, says Travis A. Lovett, the Assistant Dean of Civic Engagement and Service at the Center. The steep salaries offered by private sector industries that recruit on campus heighten that challenge.
Lovett says that the Center actively works to level the financial playing field, however, by helping to fund public service internships. It also organizes the “Public Interested Conference” each February where “students can ask alumni directly how they were able to survive in New York City on a $40,000 salary.”
But to pose a viable alternative to the finance, consulting, and tech industries, the Center has to compete with and accommodate the schedules of their recruiting processes. The majority of public service jobs do not participate in seasonal recruiting, instead hiring “with a just-in-time recruiting mindset,” as Lovett calls it, meaning that they fill positions as they become available or they receive more funds.
“We try to be as proactive as we can, but we know that it is a much different hiring timeline than McKinsey, or Goldman Sachs, [who come] to campus in September,” Lovett says. He cites this schedule as one reason the Center created Public Service Recruiting Day, an October event where seniors can interview one-on-one with what the Center’s website describes as “high-performing public sector organizations.”
“I think that folks have a very clear understanding of what it means to be a doctor or a lawyer or engineer,” says Alysha J. Williams ’14, a Program Director at the Center. “But when you think you want to go into public service, it can be hard for students to visualize what that looks like.”
Last year, Joshua A. Berry ’21 was sitting in the Mather dining hall preparing for an onslaught of consulting interviews. He wasn’t alone: he and his friends were learning the tips and tricks of the trade, and soothing nerves.
This kind of interview preparation is a must, especially with consulting, according to Katie C. Cao ’21. Students call it “casing,” a skill Cao claims is much easier to develop on campus.
Casing is a test of business acumen and reasoning — it measures your ability to think critically about common questions consulting firms may tackle. Cao says that it’s not unusual to run through more than 35 practice case interviews before the first official interview.
On campus, Cao could knock out some of that preparation by going to a dining hall and running through cases with a friend over dinner or asking an upperclassmen already hired at a desired company for help.
But Berry laments, “[There’s] no longer club meetings where you can gather together and be like, ‘Let's meet in the D-Hall and do case interviewing together now.’ It's [now] like, ‘Here are these resources online.’”
The virtual format has extinguished the social aspect of interview preparation — the part that makes such arduous work bearable, enjoyable, and accessible. “And that's really tough,” Berry notes. “You need this coaching for these interviews. Consulting and finance interviews require a lot of mock interviews you do with friends before you're successful and get the job.”
At home, it’s not as easy to ask a tutor for advice or seek mentorship from older students. It’s far more difficult to prepare, especially “if your parents [aren’t] familiar with or [don’t] speak the language and [can’t] prepare you, or you just [don’t] know a lot of people in the field to do case interviews with,” Cao notes.
“It can be a little bit chaotic to make that time for yourself and commit that many hours to just interview prep when a lot of people have other pressing, immediate responsibilities,” she says.
Dhruv Gupta ’20 warns of the added disadvantage for students who don’t have secure home environments or even a neutral video call background.
“Folks who don’t understand it get peeved by it. When you’re on a Zoom call and there’s someone with background noise because they can’t help it, it reflects poorly on them,” he says. “I’ve seen that happen in real time where people have bad conversations or bad outcomes because of the situations that they’re in.”
He adds that the privilege of technological and home life reliability holds a particular level of importance in several job sectors. “In this world of startups, impressions matter,” he emphasizes. A high-quality webcam and good lighting take utmost importance in startup culture “where the only thing you’re selling is impressions,” Gupta says.
Caleb A. Ren ’21 also notes that some groups of people have had an easier time adapting to virtual recruiting than others.
“Those who have barriers to being able to do work, either because of their home situation, or because it’s fucking hard to just sit down, do work at your computer for hours on end without friends around, or to live with your parents,” Ren says. “That’s hard.”
Jadyn K. Bryden ’21 — the current chief strategy officer of Harvard Student Agencies — says she feels lucky that she secured a job before the pandemic, especially in light of the COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. “As a Black woman, I see a lot of people in the Black community from home being negatively affected by COVID,” she says. “I had to witness my family members have to put their lives at risk [at in-person jobs] in ways that other people didn’t have to.”
“If you’re a student of color, how can you expect to do recruiting with a clear head, when this past summer exposed the systematic racism in this country?” Berry asks. “How do you expect that student to be able to put in the time to study for consulting case interviews? How would you expect them to study technicals for a coding interview?”
Ren comments that the expectation that students continue with school and the job process as if all is normal, coupled with the boundary of accessibility at these companies,“is just a subtle way of reinforcing, systemic barriers that are very much tied with factors such as socioeconomic class, race, gender.”
“It’s just not equitable,” he says.
In September, the Harvard Office of Career Services hosted a career fair unlike any before it. Instead of the typical setting — the SOCH buzzing with frenetic energy, brochures and resumes scattered across tables — each company held separate information sessions using a variety of video conferencing platforms.
In the Facebook Q&A session, a single recruiter’s face spanned the whole screen as a slew of anonymous questions appeared in the chat box. In most other information sessions, few students turned on their cameras, and the ones who did were dressed more casual than business. The chimes of Zoom exits sounded louder than usual.
“We were really good at pivoting,” says Robin E. Mount, OCS’s director, of her office’s transition to remote services. “We didn’t drop the ball on anything.”
From its experience hosting events during winter break and summer vacation and providing services for Harvard Extension School students, OCS felt well-equipped to hold offerings remotely. But a career fair was “a very different product,” Mount says.
During the first OCS career fair of the year, Ren attended multiple information sessions at once, since many companies had signed up for the same time slot. “At one point, I had Zoom open in my browser, Zoom open on my desktop, Google Hangouts on my phone. And they’re all going at once,” he says. “Oh, and Teams — Teams going on in the browser,” Ren adds after a moment of recollection. Then, his computer crashed.
Ren, who is pursuing a job in tech, had many different employers’ information sessions to attend. For students interested in industries beyond tech, consulting, or finance, this isn’t always the case.
On OCS’s website, on a page explaining their “recruiting program,” the Office answers a question that some ask about Harvard’s post-grad employment landscape: “Why is there so much Finance and Consulting?”
Associate Director of OCS Deb Carroll explains that such companies are simply most interested in actively recruiting “Harvard talent” — these employers seek out Harvard students and students from other elite schools. There are jobs elsewhere, she explains, but Harvard students have to actively look for them.
Usually, when employers invest in new recruits, they hope that they will commit to the company. Harvard students don’t tend to do this — “after they get trained, [students] up and move to a different city and quit [their] job,” Mount explains.
Within the finance, consulting, and techn industries, firms “have figured out how they can use entry-level talent and replenish it every year,” she continues. “Harvard students and these industries have figured out a mutually beneficial relationship — Harvard students get lucrative jobs right after graduation, and companies get a consistent stream of ‘Harvard talent.’”
Mount recalls how a Harvard alumnus at Boeing told her why she didn’t recruit from Harvard: “‘We’re not going to come recruit at Harvard because Harvard students don’t have the patience,’” Mount remembers her saying. “‘It takes ten years to build an airplane, and after a couple of years, they just want to go and do something else.’”
Students notice the resulting skew toward the finance, tech, and consulting industries. Justin J. Hancock ’21, who hopes to join the Harvard Teacher Fellows Program with the Harvard Graduate School of Education and eventually become a math teacher, says that he’s “not a huge fan of OCS.” Justin recognizes that while “they try to provide a lot of resources,” he also gets the impression that they show preferential treatment towards students interested in the three industries.
“One thing that I’ve noticed is they tend to schedule education things in the middle of the day, when I have class,” Hancock says. “While they have a decent number of education events every year, I usually can’t make it to any of them. And then I look at consulting events, and they’re in the evening.”
Christina Yee ’21 has found similar issues as she pursues a career in design or creative consulting. Like Hancock, Yee says that while the September influx of OCS emails don’t go unnoticed. “I don’t really see companies that I’m interested in recruiting for on that list,” Yee says.
Harvard students have also created their own avenues for professional development and employment opportunities outside of OCS, in the form of the college’s many pre-professional organizations. They often hold their own events independent from OCS to help their members secure jobs or opportunities, and train their members in soft and hard skills to build their resumes.
Bryden says she secured her current and post-graduation job as the Vice President of the venture capitalism firm Xfund with the help of HSA board member Patrick S. Chung ’96.
This isn’t to say that Bryden exclusively credits her career trajectory to HSA. “OCS [was] a vital source in helping me to be the professional I am today,” she says. “I remember when I was younger in my career at Harvard, I went to OCS to get my resume reviewed, I learned about interviewing techniques, and all that stuff stays with you. I figured out what I should wear to an interview. That’s not obvious stuff.”
Mount says that OCS tries to ensure that all Harvard students are given the chance to graduate having learned the ins and outs of the recruiting process — regardless of socioeconomic background. From hosting lunches for Fall Clean-Up participants to working with “identity-based student groups,” OCS tries to reach freshmen as early as possible to “lower the barriers of entry to our office.”
“We’ve run in this very fine dilemma where we don’t want to [look] like we’re pushing people into certain areas,” she says, referencing OCS’s abundant resources for finance, tech, and consulting. “But we also don’t want people not to know about them and miss the opportunity to choose to do that.”
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Londoner Nicolas Weninger ’20 had all but secured his position at a startup in Boston. “I classified it as an anticipated understanding, at least from my end, that I’d join them full time,” he says.
When the pandemic hit, Weninger was told that the startup was “on a hiring freeze and [wasn’t] taking anyone new, including former interns,” he recounts. “It was late March, and I was unemployed.”
Losing your post-graduation job is never ideal. But for Weninger — and other international students in his position — losing his job started a countdown timer until he lost his right to work and reside in the U.S.
Most international students study in the U.S. with an F-1 visa. An F-1 visa provides a 60-day unemployment grace period following graduation. During these 60 days, students can apply for what is called the post-completion Optional Practical Training — which extends the grace period to 90 days.
If students fail to find employment during this time, they can continue to work in the U.S. only by either obtaining a green card or by securing an H-1B visa — what Weninger calls a “crapshoot.”
Dragos Bugai ’20, a recent graduate from Moldova, laments how difficult it is to secure an H-1B visa. “You’d have to get a company to sponsor you for an H-1B visa,” he says. “Why is this hard? Well, the company has to put a huge amount of money on the line, we’re talking like five figures — like a hundred thousand dollars, sometimes even more — to sponsor you for a visa.”
“When the company has to choose between you and some American guy or girl where the company doesn’t need to suffer an expense, who are they going to choose?” he asks.
This past summer, Bugai found out that his OPT application had been rejected for a clerical reason just two days before the deadline to reapply.
“You can only reapply [...] 60 days after you graduate,” he explains. “If you don’t have an application on their desk within those 60 days, then you can’t apply for it. And you have to leave the U.S. immediately. And that’s it with your work status.”
At the time, Bugai was living in Nantucket with a Harvard friend. He had two days to get a printed application onto the right desk in Arizona. He recalls that it took a concerted effort of friends across the country for him to get his application in on time.
“We all made this big effort. And I managed to send it in,” he says. Bugai’s application was approved last week.
But as Bugai mentions, even with approval to stay, an international student must compete for positions at companies that are generally more inclined to give the spot to their American peers.
Recently, South African Paula A. Chappel ’20 recalls, she was helping edit a friend’s cover letter and noticed that the friend wrote that she was from an international city. Chappel commented: “Please don’t put that in your cover letter. You want to act like you have no ties to your home country. You can stay [in the United States]. You don’t want them to be like, ‘International? Out!’”
“Being an international [student] definitely changes companies’ perceptions of you and whether they want to employ you, because they know that even if it’s three years down the line, there’s complications coming,” Chappel explains. “Some jobs are more fussy about that; some jobs just say, ‘If you’re international, don’t apply.’”
When asked about how OCS has been supporting international students, Mount sighs.
“Oh, it’s just a very sad story,” she says. “It’s never easy to get a job as an international student, but when the economy is strong, Harvard students tend to be okay. And then a couple of years ago, way before the pandemic, we started to see this tightening up — a lot of it coming from the Trump administration.”
Chappel, who has secured jobs at a private equity firm and a consulting firm, cannot help but feel grateful for how things worked out for her in the long run.
Weninger also considers himself fortunate to have eventually received a job offer in San Francisco as an embedded systems engineer. He got the job after meeting a Harvard alum at a talk sponsored by the Harvard University Aeronautical Society.
Bugai, however, was more apprehensive about sharing his story. He is still in Nantucket, Mass., working remotely on data cleaning jobs among other short term data science projects. He’s also doing some tutoring on the side.
“I was thinking whether [or not] I should interview because I felt shame that I failed as a Harvard student by not securing something right [after graduation],” he says. He feels that he failed to “fulfill this mandate that I was given of being successful right out of college.”
“But then I realized that, hey, you know, times are what they are.”
Berry worries for a certain kind of Harvard student from the class of 2021.
He’s worried for students who said to themselves upon arriving at college: “Harvard is four years where I can really explore and find all my interests. And I don’t even have to worry about finding a job because by the time I’m a senior, the jobs are going to come to me, because I’m a Harvard student.”
The pandemic has disadvantaged those types of students, Berry fears, the students who “took Harvard as a sort of liberal arts education where [they decided] ‘I don’t join professional clubs, but I join a cappella, I joined The Crimson.’”
“Companies are less willing to take risks on those students,” Berry suggests. “There’s less jobs overall. When companies do make hires, they probably don’t want the student who did a cappella — [they’re] probably looking for those hyper pre-professional students who knew from day one that they wanted to do consulting or finance.”
Eli W. Russell ’20 is one of those students. He hopes to go into television writing, and before the pandemic, he had imagined moving out to Los Angeles and working as an assistant. Now he lives at home, working for the Michigan Democratic Caucus, because “politics is one of the few industries that’s actually hiring.”
While Russell did not pursue a job in one of the so-called “recruiting sectors,” he did embrace the liberal arts promise — and ultimately graduated jobless. For a few months following graduation, he was unemployed and lived at home, working on his writing portfolio. While he did not expect to return home after graduation, he says he “feels very lucky his parents will house [him] and feed [him].”
Jasper D. C. Johnston ’20, however, knew from day one that he wanted to do consulting.
“My father does negotiation consulting,” he says. “In high school, I got interested and involved in his work — I helped advise a number of his clients, and having that opportunity, obviously, is very helpful,” he adds. “From a young age, [it] just started to appeal to me.”
Johnston credits his involvement with Harvard Undergraduate Consulting on Business and the Environment, a pre-professional “consulting strategy group,” with helping him secure a job at McKinsey & Company. “A really tough decision” amid the pandemic, he says, was choosing between accepting his job offer or beginning a Master’s program at Oxford. (He has also been accepted at Harvard Law School via the Junior Deferral Program.) Johnston recognizes that he “was in a very privileged position of actually having these options and having them not fall through.” He sighs. “But it was still tough.”
That Johnston and Russell’s experiences could so starkly diverge calls into question the validity of the University’s oft-touted “liberal arts education” — at least in the realm of post-graduate employment. Though the pandemic may have widened the gap between the students who pursue pre-professional clubs and those who join a cappella groups or The Crimson, it didn’t create it. But many students, Berry suggests, had assumed that Harvard’s implicit “promise” had insulated them from its vicissitudes.
“The majority of Americans, the majority of people in this world, go to college to get a degree [and then] to get a job,” Berry suggests. Harvard, he says, offers something more: the opportunity to receive the fullness of a liberal arts education — one where you can study the humanities or join an a capella group — and still get a good job after graduation.
Now, just like everyone else, Harvard students may have to choose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Petros Koutrakis, an environmental sciences professor at Harvard’s School of Public Health, and his research team published a study last week presenting evidence of increased levels of airborne radiation in areas within 12 miles of United States hydraulic fracturing sites.
The study — published Oct. 13 in Nature — was based on an analysis of radiation network data at 157 sites nationwide and measured how radioactivity corresponds with distance from fracking wells. The sites comprise a network where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitors radiation in the air and water.
Though Koutrakis’s study identified higher radiation levels near fracking sites, it did not trace the exact source and timing of radiation leaks into the surrounding environment.
“Of course, we did the modeling, but just for simplification, we found that as the sites are getting closer to these developments, we have an increase in particle radioactivity,” Koutrakis said.
Koutrakis said that, while those who live near these sites do not face immediate health consequences, they do face an extra risk of certain chronic health outcomes: lung function changes, decreased lung volume, cardiac effects, birth defects, and mortality. The study noted that the sites are often located in low-income areas, potentially worsening health effects for those who live nearby.
Currently, Koutrakis said his team is unsure whether radiation leaks occur during the construction and production of oil, during storage in wastewater lagoons, or when the oil is transferred through pumps.
Because the government does not identify fracking waste as nuclear waste, Koutrakis said, waste material is currently discarded in municipal landfills or used for irrigation. Additionally, fracking companies do not disclose the chemicals they use in extraction, resulting in unknown pollutants making their way into the environment, according to Koutrakis.
James K. Hammitt ’78, an economics professor at the School of Public Health, said that the Koutrakis’s team’s study could be a valuable first step in helping limit people’s exposure to radiation sources.
“By understanding these sources better, maybe we can recommend or develop technologies to control exposures,” Hammitt said.
Koutrakis, the lead author on the study, was joined by fellow authors at the School of Public Health: research fellow Longxiang Li, postdoctoral fellow Annelise J. Blomberg, environmental health professor John D. Spengler, environmental epidemiology professor Joel D. Schwartz, and biostatistics professor Brent A. Coull.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Texas at Austin communications professor Natalie J. Stroud discussed her research on correcting misperceptions of news spread through social media in the latest installment of the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center’s virtual misinformation speaker series Wednesday.
Working in collaboration with five fact-checking organizations worldwide, Stroud used Facebook sponsored posts to gauge how changing the forms of news headlines on an article posted to social media could affect the way people perceived the information the article contained. The group studied three types of headlines: “question,” in which the headline only questions but does not assert; “assertion,” which states correct information only; and “refutation,” which states, then refutes, a problematic claim.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of fact-checking in the real world, “where people are inundated with information,” her study also accounted for the ability of a headline to draw attention.
“We've had a lot of research on fact-checking that show people misinformation, and show people a fact check, and it's in the context of an experimental setting that doesn't have any of the real-world attributes,” Stroud said.
Explaining the study’s methods, Stroud said the project was “one of the first academic uses” of Brand Lift, a tool typically used commercially to measure the impact of a brand’s Facebook ads.
Facebook users included in her study were asked to complete a survey after viewing the ad, she said. The survey garnered more than 60,000 responses from five countries and recorded information such as the user’s answers to true-false questions about the article and whether the user actually clicked to read the article.
The fact that clicks were roughly the same across the board was “bad news” for the question format, in which the headline contains no assertions at all, Stroud said.
“In terms of attention, there actually aren't that many differences,” she said.
Stroud found the refutation headline was most effective in terms of learning or knowledge acquisition.
“Refutation delivers a superior performance,” Stroud said. “They’re reducing the ‘don’t know’s and they’re increasing the percentage of people that are correctly answering the question.”
She concluded that “there may be some efficacy to using refutation,” though she added it is important to keep the reasons behind that choice in mind.
“It comes from reducing the number of people who aren't sure, and it does not come from reducing the number of people who answer these questions incorrectly,” Stroud said.
In addition to using more refutation headlines, Stroud emphasized the importance of conducting more research on reducing misinformation on social media.
“It's doing these sorts of studies to really find out how people are responding in real-world contexts. Looking at headline format is one component of a fact check, but there are so many others, so I think that the method is also something that could be employed more generally, and that would ultimately help to have social media correct misperceptions,” Stroud said.

Harvard researchers discovered that the level of outpatient visits — hospital visits that do not require overnight hospitalization — has largely returned to pre-pandemic numbers.
The team has been analyzing different trends in the numbers and types of outpatient visits made across varying demographics since May using data from Phreesia, a company providing health care patient intake software.
Ateev Mehrotra, a health care professor at Harvard Medical School and lead author of the analysis, said the data shows COVID-19’s widespread negative effect on the ability of patients to receive various medical treatments.
“From a public health perspective, when we think about the impact of this pandemic, there are spillovers or other effects that may be even larger in terms of the deaths and morbidity that we see from this virus,” Mehrotra said. “What I mean specifically, is that patients who have cancer, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, asthma, and on and on, did not get the care they needed, because of the pandemic.”
Although the analysis showed cumulative outpatient visit numbers had largely recovered from a nearly 60 percent decrease in April, the number of such visits for children between zero and five are still between 10 and 20 percent below pre-pandemic levels. Mehrotra said this drop may be due to parents’ precautions to prevent their children from contracting COVID-19 at a clinic or an overall decrease in illness spread among children due to stay-at-home measures.
Mehrotra also noted the unexpected result that, although 41 percent of behavioral health providers employed telemedicine methods in the most recent data, the number of behavioral health visits has still remained below the pre-pandemic baseline.
“One of the very surprising findings was that behavioral health providers were providing, at least in this sample, fewer visits than from baseline — not at all what I expected,” Mehrotra said. “Because there's more need, and there's less supply, that raises the concern about unmet need, and that the American public, or some Americans at least, are suffering with their symptoms and not getting the care that they need.”
The report also emphasized that the patient’s type of insurance and the providers’ number of clinicians both have impacted the number of outpatient visits, with Medicare patients now making more appointments than before the pandemic and larger healthcare practices seeing more visits.
Mehrotra said the dataset may not be generalizable to the U.S. population as it only includes health care providers using the Phreesia platform.
Mehrotra said his team will continue to publish outpatient visit tracking reports as long as they continue to be used by government and health care officials.
“Policymakers at state to the federal level, Congressional Budget Office — those kinds of organizations, they found these data useful because they are very up to date," he said. "And so, to the degree that these data continue to be useful, we'll continue to produce them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute’s COVID-19 Simulator website have designed a new tool that focuses on a particular potential superspreader event: football games.
The new tool, called the COVID-19 Football Tracker, arose from a collaboration among Harvard Medical School, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Boston Medical Center. The feature is an extension of the Institute’s existing COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool, which visualizes the effects of different COVID-19 prevention measures. The COVID-19 Football Tracker will specifically allow policymakers, team managers, and citizens to analyze the effects of resuming in-person football games.
Asmae Toumi, a data analyst at the MGH Institute for Technology Assessment, said that the football tracker is aimed at better informing team managers and the public about whether it is safe to host and attend games.
“We've noticed that the decision making with regards to in-person attendance seemed pretty arbitrary and random. This was a few weeks back, but team executives would say, ‘Okay, by the end of October, we'll open up our stadiums to fans.’ Well, [how] was that decision made, on what kind of evidence?” Toumi said, “Can we help them make better decisions?”
The COVID-19 Football Tracker uses an AI-approach to overlay football games and data from multiple sources to estimate how quickly COVID-19 is spreading. The tool uses a wide variety of factors to determine the rate of spread in counties from football stadiums; these include facemask mandates, the number of tests performed, and population density, among others.

The tool also allows scientists to track the rate of COVID-19 spread at NCAA and NFL games 0n the county level. Toumi explained that there is an increased coronavirus spread with the NFL and NCAA football teams, as compared to NBA and NHL teams, because the former are not playing in bubbles throughout the season.
According to Jagpreet Chhatwal, principal investigator of the COVID-19 Simulator Website and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, football games can also accelerate the spread of COVID-19 because fans often travel from neighboring counties to attend them.
“By identifying counties where cases are rising, policymakers could act early (e.g., closing of restaurants and schools) or [the] NCAA and NFL [could] cancel in-person attendance in football games to slow down the spread and minimize damage,” Chhatwal wrote in an emailed statement.
The information the COVID-19 Football Tracker gleans is also publicly available for those who want to attend games.

“The football tracker tool will be specifically designed for team executives and for league officials, but also for you as a fan, thinking of attending one of these games,” said Toumi. “You might want to view how badly or how well your county may be doing, and hopefully, that will factor into your decision on whether you think it is safe for you to be there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe Fellow Robert F. Reid-Pharr showcased his work on the legendary novelist, poet, and activist James Baldwin as part of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies Fellows' Presentation Series on Wednesday afternoon.
Reid-Pharr is also a professor of studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality and of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and has written extensively on topics of class, racial identity, black Atlantic internationalism, and what it means to be a contemporary intellectual.
Wednesday’s presentation centered around Reid-Pharr’s draft of “James Baldwin: The Making of an American Icon,” a biographical account of Baldwin’s life that investigates how such a radical individual was able to become one of the most popularly influential intellectuals of the 20th century.
Working with archival materials at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and the Houghton and Beinecke Libraries of Harvard and Yale Universities, Reid-Pharr utilized diverse forms of media to construct his analysis of Baldwin’s life.
He drew from two sections of a draft chapter to teach the audience about the idea of celebrity in American culture and Baldwin’s friendship with modernist painter Beauford Delaney, who was known for his works during the Harlem Renaissance.
Reid-Pharr began by introducing background information about Baldwin’s education and time as a Pentecostal minister. Since the young age of 16, Reid-Pharr explained, Baldwin’s adolescence was filled with extreme hardships.
Baldwin “suffered through bare-knuckled racism, choking poverty, and his stepfather's uncontainable madness,” Reid-Pharr said, reading an excerpt from his draft.
Reid-Pharr used an analysis of Delaney’s artwork and its symbolism to present the struggle Baldwin faced. He connected Baldwin’s adolescence to Delaney’s 1941 portrait of Baldwin, titled “Dark Rapture.”
“In ‘Dark Rapture,’ Delaney attempted to demonstrate the complication, and perhaps even the beauty, of James, and pitched the struggle with the many images of James. He understood, moreover, that there was something majestic in that struggle,” Reid-Pharr said.
Delaney’s work is so widely received and anticipated because of the lack of resources released about Baldwin, according to Reid-Pharr, who noted that “Dark Rapture” was one of the “very few nude portraits ever produced by an ever reticent and formal painter before Delaney.”
Reid-Pharr argued, however, that “Dark Rapture” didn’t gain popularity because it resembled Baldwin or a nude body; rather, he said “Dark Rapture” sought to “demonstrate the complication and perhaps even the beauty of James and with the many images of James.”
Reid-Pharr also addressed Baldwin’s status as both a celebrity and a writer. He explained how he used literary and cultural criticism and studied at least ten other biographies to generate a new perspective on Baldwin’s story.
“We’re fascinated by celebrities in this country,” Reid-Pharr said. “I thought I could make a real contribution on that angle versus doing another study of his literature.”

Harvard will launch its “Harvard Online” program — designed for interdisciplinary, interactive course clusters — this coming January, beginning with a four-week long course called “Data Science Ready.”
The course, which will be delivered on the existing HBS Online platform, will be taught by Deputy Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Dustin Tingley. “Data Science Ready” will focus on providing nontechnical professionals the skills required to interpret and implement data in their fields of work.
“What’s a data science course for someone who is not a data scientist, and instead is someone who works with, or alongside data scientists? That informed two principles: one was equipping people to be critical thinkers when it comes to data,” Tingley said. “The second is facilitating communication.”
Harvard currently offers a multitude of online offerings, ranging from open courseware delivered via the EdX platform to specialized certificate programs from the Medical School’s HMX platform. Additionally, the Extension School offers degree programs with both online and in-person course components.
Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Bharat N. Anand ’88 said that the Harvard Online platform would specifically focus on offering sequences of courses designed to provide interdisciplinary perspectives on a topic.
“Take any topic of interest today, whether it's healthcare, whether it's climate change, whether it's data and digital; these are big topics, right?” Anand said. “These are complex topics and almost no case, will you get a full understanding by just taking one course or from one discipline, whether it's economics or medicine or business or policy or whatever it is.”
Anand said that until now, Harvard courses have existed separately from the teaching ecosystem at large, offering fewer opportunities to gather multiple perspectives around a single issue.
“We look at online courses and even courses historically that Harvard has created, it's typically been sort of the one faculty one course approach. But as a result of that, you might end up creating 15 courses in healthcare, but really there's no narrative arc — you're missing the connections across them,” Anand said.
Though the course will be listed on the Harvard Online platform, it will be delivered via the existing HBS Online system. Tingley said that the course management system uniquely allows for “inductive learning,” where students discover concepts through case studies and examples rather than direct lecture.
HBS Online spokesperson Michele Reynolds said that the HBS Online platform focuses on student engagement to “keep the learners on their toes” by cold calling, assigning reflection questions, and facilitating offline study groups.
“Our courses really are very active. We introduced the infamous HBS cold call,” Reynolds said. “They have a short period of time with which to respond and then their classmates can see their response and weigh in. So a lot of the learning that takes place in our courses is peer to peer.”
Anand said that the expansion of online opportunities presented a unique dilemma between “preserving the integrity of the educational experience” and “democratizing education.”
“The lines between residential and online, at least for the last seven months, have completely blurred,” Anand said. “What does this mean for the future of the university? How do we think about not just the great residential experience we offer students, but hybrid modes, online modes? How do we think about that in its entirety?”

The Cambridge City Council’s Ordinance Committee held a public hearing Wednesday afternoon to discuss the Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee Report, a document detailing updated guidelines for conservation of the district.
The report is the culmination of a two-year initiative in which the Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee — headed by Cambridge Historical Commission executive director Charles M. Sullivan — developed “an amended statement of goals and secondary goals and amended guidelines for demolition, construction, and alterations.”
“In our process for reviewing applications in conservation districts, the commission is directed to review those applications in the context of the goals for the individual district,” Sullivan said at the hearing. “The study committee focused on refining those goals to provide better guidance for the Historic Commission as it administers the conservation district and better guidance to provide clearer expectations for applicants and residents of the district.”
The Cambridge Historical Commission defines neighborhood conservation districts as areas consisting of buildings that are “architecturally and historically distinctive.” The commission aims to protect these neighborhoods, which includes Harvard Square, by holding public hearings on applications for “signs and alterations; demolition and new construction; and additions.”
Sullivan said Harvard Square’s unique position as a commercial neighborhood demanded special consideration.
“Harvard Square, of course, is not like Mid-Cambridge, or Avon Hill, or any other conservation district — it's a commercial neighborhood,” he said. “Maintaining the commercial vitality of the district is a very strong and important primary goal.”
Among its amendments, the report offers new language supporting goals related to commercial urban experiences, residential development, transportation and pedestrian safety, and energy conservation. It also outlines a new goal for regulating architectural lighting.
Additionally, the report proposes adjusting the division of the Harvard Square Overlay District from six sub-districts into seven to better reflect the sub-districts’ evolving characters.
Sullivan said one of the committee’s accomplishments was fostering cooperation between different stakeholders who had been in disagreement for decades.
“The situation in Harvard Square was such that there were people who had been at loggerheads for decades, literally decades,” Sullivan said in an interview after the event. “If the timing is right and if you're patient, there is always a possibility that you can take intractable opposing opinions and form a consensus.”
Sullivan attributed some of the committee’s success in reaching consensus to the structure of the meetings and the committee’s methods.
He said the committee made sure to invite all applicants — including those who had not been offered a spot on the committee — as well as representatives from the University and other relevant stakeholders to participate in the discussions on an “equal basis” with the appointed members.
“They all came to all of these many, many meetings, and everybody sat around the table and faced each other,” he said. “Everybody had a placard — nobody was identified as being an appointed member or not.”
There was also no set time for the meetings, only structured agendas, and the discussions were allowed to go on freely “for as long as people wanted to talk,” he added.
Several council members praised the report and the committee’s leadership during the hearing.
“I thought this was the best process I've ever seen in Cambridge, and it's not that people came — as you alluded to, Mr. Sullivan — came with the same opinion on many issues. But you helped reach that consensus,” said Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, chair of the Ordinance Committee.
“This is a process that we can and should use as a model to understand how it is that we can, in a potentially contentious situation, bring folks together,” Councilor Patricia M. Nolan added.
The Ordinance Committee unanimously moved forward with a favorable recommendation on the presentation and the report to the full City Council.

Howard University history professor Ana Lucia Araujo and Carnegie Mellon French professor Mame-Fatou Niang discussed recent debates regarding the removal of statues that depict slave traders and owners in Europe at an event Wednesday afternoon.
Roughly 180 participants tuned into the seminar hosted by The Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies and moderated by Harvard French history professor Mary D. Lewis. The conversation was contextualized by the demonstrations against police violence and racist legacies, which erupted across Europe following the death of George Floyd in May of this year.
Lewis said that she was not surprised that George Floyd’s murder and other incidences of U.S. police brutality resonated so strongly with citizens of France — a country with a complicated color-blind outlook on race, typically a taboo topic.
“After George Floyd was murdered, France had perhaps the largest Black Lives Matter demonstration anywhere in the world,” she said. “People weren’t just condemning the racism in the United States, which would have been one way of interpreting it, but rather associating what happened to George Floyd with another death in police custody by a similar means." Adama Traoré unexplainably died in police custody in France in 2016.
Araujo and Lewis began by talking about monuments as memorialization of colonialism in Europe. Araujo, author of “Slavery in the Age of Memory: Engaging the Past,” emphasized that removing monuments that pay homage to those who defended and participated in the Atlantic slave trade is not an unprecedented trend. She pointed to crowds that tore down monuments during the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution, and the fall of Eastern Europe’s communist regimes to highlight that this is not an isolated phenomenon.
Araujo said she disagreed with French President Emmanuel Macron’s argument that France would, “erase no trace or names of its history, it will forget none of its works, it will tear down none of its statues.”
“You don't erase a history by removing a monument. Then, the history is written, is stored, and is preserved elsewhere, in museums, in the archives and in scholarship,” Araujo said.
Niang said that she worries that the momentum from the 2020 demonstrations in France, in addition to similar protests in the past several years, may be misconstrued as attacks against France.
Niang stressed that beheading a pro-slavery statue is a powerful symbol — breaking down longstanding barriers around these conversations.
“People would express themselves on the statue, and here, I use the word express not deface,” she said. “The statue became a receptacle, the page on which was inscribed stories of the city.”
These inscribed stories, she added, run contrary to the misconception that the history of the Atlantic Slave Trade is relevant only to its descendants or those living in America and Brazil.
“In our education, how come people cannot see this as a history of France, but it's seen as an outside history,” Niang said.
The seminar ended with an audience Q&A. Many attendees asked about adding educational plaques to statues of slave traders, or if more substantial actions should be taken. Both Niang and Araujo added that in addition to plaques, there needs to be substantial changes to educational institutions in France.
“Right now, it looks like any memorialization or any education on race and memory especially among questions on race and slavery, is happening in real time, and everywhere, but in textbooks or in institutional settings,” Niang said. “We cannot maintain monuments to white supremacy outside, as it exists here in the United States, and on the other hand, claim to write textbooks that will be accurate.”
Wednesday’s event is part of a two-part series. Next semester, their event — “Race and Representation” — will touch on political representation in Europe.
Correction: October 22, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mary D. Lewis said she was surprised George Floyd's murder resonated in France. In fact, she said she was not surprised.

Sherri A. Charleston — the University’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer — discussed the importance of “concrete objectives” in improving equity issues at Harvard in an interview Wednesday.
Charleston, who assumed her role on Sept. 1, said she is currently focused on “assessing what the community’s needs are” through conversations with students, faculty members, and administrators.
“We are gaining some clarity around what it is that we want to accomplish as an institution, and then charting a pathway for how we want to get there in the respective schools,” Charleston said.
Former University President Drew Faust’s Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging created the role of Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer in 2018.
Charleston reports to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and helps to oversee the implementation of recommendations from the task force. These include recruiting diverse faculty members, improving mental health resources across the University, and creating inclusive and accessible spaces.
She is also currently on the search committee for the next chief of the Harvard University Police Department. Current chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley is retiring at the end of the year, a decision he announced months after The Crimson reported on racism, sexism, and alleged favoritism in the department spanning more than two decades.
Most of Charleston’s work as a senior central administrator will involve coordinating diversity and inclusion initiatives at all 12 of the University’s schools.
Charleston said that the “decentralized” nature of the University is both one of its “greatest challenges” and “greatest opportunities.”
“What's unique about this institution, given it's decentralization, is that we have opportunities to really work in each of those local environments to figure out what works best,” Charleston said.
The central question that underlies her work at each school, though, is the same: “How are we going to improve the experience that our students have, that our faculty, our staff, our postdocs have, in the greatest number of ways, in the shortest amount of time?”
“The agenda on some level could be infinite,” she said.
Given the seemingly endless areas of improvement, Charleston said she believes part of her role is narrowing the agenda to what she sees as most important and achievable.
“We're not going to solve a 400-year-plus problem in a few years — it's just impossible,” she said. “And so part of the work that I do is helping us to think about how we prioritize what, and what's going to allow us to move the needle by catching the greatest number of balls and moving those up the hill.”
Charleston also discussed the importance of measuring success with “somewhat specific and concrete objectives” to help reduce the trust issues institutions face when there is a discrepancy between their words and their actions.
“We just have to be very, very clear about what it is that we're trying to achieve, and then consistently do the work, measuring our progress and assessing it, and when we're not moving in the right direction, changing course,” Charleston said.
She also emphasized the importance of having a larger strategy behind work on equity issues, rather than performing “ad hoc work” that leaves institutions with “no systematic structural progress.”
“It's an act of prioritization, and thinking about how we grapple with these things in very systematic and structured ways that will allow us to make progress,” she said.
Despite the magnitude of the challenge, Charleston remains enthusiastic and optimistic about the future. Though she is just the first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer at Harvard, she is already thinking about who will be the last.
“I love the work that I do, but I have said this on more than one occasion, I wake everyday, and I try to think about how I'm going to work myself out of a job,” she said. “We shouldn't be here forever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black student athletes at Harvard formed a group to create a mutual support system and to promote inclusion at the College against a backdrop of a national racial reckoning.
Students founded the group, the Harvard Athletics Black Varsity Association, late this summer in response to the murders of Black men and women — including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor — at the hands of police and the ensuing protest movements.
Though racial unrest served as the immediate impetus for the group’s formation, Annika Bassey ’22, one of the group’s founders and chairs, said she had previously wanted to create such a space at Harvard.
Bassey, who is a member of the women’s tennis team, said that, as a freshman, she had difficulty meeting other Black athletes at Harvard. Bassey is one of two Black athletes on a team of 13.
“It seemed like a common feeling between, among all the Black athletes,” she said. “There wasn’t really a space for us to meet and actually hang out and get to know each other across different teams.”
She was reminded of that concern over the summer when there was “no group for us to mourn together.”
Director of Strength and Conditioning James L. Frazier, who advises the group, said a dedicated space for Black athletes will help them “understand that they’re not alone.”
“If I’m the only person of color on a team, there might not be other people who share my viewpoint, since I might actually have some complications that might be arising due to my color,” Frazier said.
Bassey’s coach, Traci L. Green, said she was eager to advise and help launch the new student organization, which the athletics department co-sponsored.
“I share a lot of commonalities with many of our students at Harvard, particularly our student-athletes,” she said. “Just talking to them, getting a sense of them, whether we’d be eating in Eliot Dining Hall, and we just started talking. Again, there was a true sense of the need for this organization in a positive way, for a sense of community and belonging and things of that nature.”
Green, who is the only Black female head coach at Harvard and one of a handful in the entire Ivy League, said she relates to Black athletes’ experience.
“On a personal level, growing up and playing often in predominantly white sports, and attending and navigating in predominantly white spaces in high school and in college, that pretty much gives me a unique perspective to sort of help and guide our student-athletes along,” she said.
Some Black athletes also said the organization will serve purposes existing Black student organizations do not.
Bassey said her athletics schedule made it difficult to routinely participate in events hosted by Black student organizations. The Black Varsity Association also encourages Harvard affiliates regardless of their race or athletic ability to participate in the group’s events.
By engaging Harvard affiliates across a broad spectrum in conversations about racism, the group hopes to mitigate harmful stereotypes about Black student athletes.
“When you take into account that you’re not only a Black student, but you’re also an athlete, that’s kind of like a double negative, especially being at an Ivy League institution,” Sharelle Samuel ’22, a chair of the group and member of the women’s track and field team, said. “You feel like, ‘Dang, I’m really out here with almost two disadvantages from the start.’”
Men’s soccer player Ben F. Bryant ’22 said he joined the group because he felt frustrated by criticism of athletes’ participation in anti-racist activism over the summer.
“There’s always this kind of relation between the athlete as a commodity and the athlete as a person,” he said. “What’s great about BVA is that it connects us both on the level of our Blackness, but also that we are athletes, and we’re going through the same grind together, and our frustrations of being limited in what we can do personally are very similar.”
In addition to developing relationships across teams, Black athletes in the group will serve as mentors and mentees. They will involve Black alumni of Harvard Athletics in their group, and they also plan to advise Black elementary school students in the greater Boston area, public health guidelines permitting.
Brian A. Cromwell, Jr. ’23, a member of the football team, said he is excited to form relationships with young Black athletes outside of Harvard.
“The main point of this is to give younger students some kind of guidance, and also show them that Harvard is an attainable goal,” he said. “It’s really important for communities of color to have role models, and people to look up to. And just having conversations with these kids, we think we could have an impact.”

United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) reiterated his support for exploring the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday at a youth voter town hall hosted by the Boston Intercollegiate Government.
Markey, who defeated U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) last month after a contentious Democratic primary squabble, has been one of the more vocal supporters of exploring court packing if conservative nominee Amy Coney Barrett is appointed in the coming weeks. His stance comes as Democratic presidential nominee Joseph R. Biden Jr. has tiptoed around taking a stand on such a proposal.
“My feeling is that if they do this — and I’m going to fight it with every political fiber in my body over this next week — that it’s going to be imperative, next year, for us to repeal the filibuster rule and to begin the discussion of the expansion of the Supreme Court,” Markey said.
Markey’s GOP opponent, lawyer Kevin O’Connor — who spoke after him in the second half of the town hall — said the idea is a “fool’s errand.”
“Court packing has been widely regarded as a terrible idea,” O’Connor said. “And it’s a bad idea because what it does is it creates the foreseeable and inevitable consequence that each time one party is in party, it will pack the court.”
Markey said Democrats “just can’t allow” the GOP “to get away with” appointing Barrett mere days before the election after Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama’s appointment of Merrick B. Garland ’74 in 2016 on the grounds that it was too close to an election.
“The Republicans are flat out lying,” Markey said. “They’re just flat out lying with what they said they were going to do in 2016. And it was just to steal a Supreme Court seat, which is what they did. They lied.”
“Now, if they were consistent this year and they did not try to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, that would be different,” he added. “But this is just hypocrisy on stilts. I mean, it’s an absolute heist of the Supreme Court that they’re trying to engage in.”
O’Connor did indicate he would be open to imposing a mandatory retirement age of 75 for justices in order to provide “greater predictability and a sense that judges will be leaving at the end of a foreseeable time period.”
The two also differed on two issues that Markey said requires an expanded court to protect: health care and the environment.
O’Connor, a supporter of President Donald J. Trump who faces long odds in November, said Markey “has become pretty good at taking hard-line positions that are not even in the mainstream of the Democratic Party,” pointing to his support for the Green New Deal, which he co-sponsored with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
“It would bankrupt our country and your futures,” O’Connor said. “And it’s not feasible because it’s entirely based on renewable energy, and we don’t have the storage capacity right now to achieve that.”
“What we need to do is to harness our innovative capacity to develop the technologies that will bring us to a carbon-neutral level, and I think we can do it by 2050,” he added.
Markey, who has served in Washington since 1976, has made the Green New Deal a cornerstone of his campaign, which helped him to garner the support of Massachusetts’ energized progressive wing in his primary race with Kennedy.
“If you believe in climate change, and you want to do something about it, we’re going to have to change the court if they continue on this reckless pathway that they have taken us over this last month with Amy Coney Barrett,” Markey said. “But the same thing is true if you believe that everyone is entitled to health care.”
O’Connor expressed opposition to the Affordable Care Act, first passed in 2010, calling it “a one-size-fits-all system that has failed, by all accounts.”
“We want to have coverage rooted in private providers,” he said.
Markey pointed to protecting Obamacare as a central motivation for his opposition to Barrett.
“For millions of families across our country, it will be a disaster if they vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act,” Markey said of the Supreme Court.
Calling this election “our own 1932,” Markey called on young people to seek out organizing opportunities on campuses.
“A re-election of Trump is like a death sentence to the planet,” he said. “There’s just a perversion of science and democracy. So if you care about any of these things, do some work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scientists at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics collaborated to publish a paper on a star’s spaghettification, the process in which a star is ripped apart by a black hole, last Monday.
Royal Astronomy Society research fellow Matt Nicholl led the study and collaborated with three Harvard astrophysicists to observe a star’s spaghettification with the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope and New Technology Telescope.
Following the initial observation period, universities from around the world including Harvard collected additional data to document the event.
Sebastian Gomez, an astrophysics graduate student at Harvard, said Nicholl noted a potentially noteworthy event from initial observations and further data confirmed a signal that suggested spaghettification.
“What Matt did here is he saw one of these alerts and said, ‘Okay, this is coming from the nucleus of the galaxy. It’s consistent with the center of the galaxy, where there is a supermassive black hole. That could be a tidal disruption event, or a star being eaten by a black hole,’” Gomez said.
Griffin Hosseinzadeh, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics, said the publication provided novel insight into the process through which stars are destroyed by black holes, particularly because the spaghettification observed was notably closer than in prior occurrences.
“The unique thing about this one in particular — and we’ve found tidal disruption events before — is that this one was the most nearby,” Hosseinzadeh said. “They’re pretty rare events. This one was a great opportunity to get a very high quality data set.”
Yvette Cendes, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics who was not affiliated with the study, mentioned how significant the finding was in the field of tidal disruption events, defined as when a star is torn apart by a black hole.
“This discovery is an exciting one because TDEs [tidal disruption events] are a relatively new field in astronomy — it's really only taken off in the last decade or so as more than a side curiosity, for perspective, and there are only less than a hundred TDE candidates,” she wrote in a statement. “Maybe two-thirds of those are well sampled and about 10 total have confirmed radio observations as well.”
Cendes also mentioned the relative closeness of the study’s observed TDE, providing a more detailed glimpse into the process of spaghettification.
“It's the closest TDE we've ever observed, which is really exciting because it means you can see details we haven't been able to observe previously,” she wrote. “When a TDE occurs, the emission from the event lasts for many years after at some frequencies, which can tell you about the inner regions of the host galaxy itself, and this is going to be an interesting object to follow in the years to come.”
Specialists from various universities collaborated to conduct diverse aspects of analysis.
“When you know that there’s a tidal disruption event happening and you need to get observations quickly, you basically call on all of your collaborators to get the observations,” Hosseinzadeh said.
“Ultimately, there’s one group that’s leading the analysis effort, but in terms of getting observations we all work together,” he added.

Harvard has received over $1.1 billion in foreign funding since 2012, per an initial Department of Education report.
The DOE report — released Tuesday — examined Harvard and other universities’ compliance with foreign funding criteria. Its release comes as department officials are investigating Harvard’s funding from contracts or gifts connected to the governments of China, Iran, Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.
Under Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, American universities are required to disclose all donations of over $250,000 from a foreign source.
In February, the Department asked Harvard to release information on funding from two Chinese telecommunications companies, Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp.; two Russian entities, the Kaspersky Lab and Skolkovo Foundation; Iran’s Alavi Foundation; the Wuhan University of Technology in China; and other organizations.
Harvard has complied with the ongoing investigation, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email.
“Harvard has filed Section 117 reports for decades and will continue to do so. In line with the Feb. 11 request from DOE, the University has submitted updated Section 117 reports for the period 2014 to 2018, as well as its regular filings for 2019 and 2020, to date,” he wrote.
Swain added that the University had recently updated its disclosure forums to reflect Department of Education criteria. In doing so, Harvard widened the range of contracts included in its reports, with most of the additions stemming from “contract amounts from the sale and licensing of academic publications and from offering executive education programs.”
Harvard is one of 12 institutions currently under investigation. The Department is also examining funding practices at MIT, Yale University, Stanford University, Georgetown University, University of Texas, Cornell University, Texas A&M University, Rutgers University, University of Maryland, Case Western Reserve University, and Fordham University.
The unredacted portions of the DOE report includes detailed findings about several of those schools. In Harvard’s case, however, federal investigators wrote that a review of donations records the University turned over was “ongoing” at the time of publication.
The Department cited charges against embattled chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber as an example of the “scope of the problem” of foreign funding. Federal officials indicted Lieber in June, alleging that he lied to federal investigators about his affiliation with the Chinese Government’s Thousand Talents Program.
The DOE also criticized Harvard’s previously-reported financial links to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the report dubbed “a high-profile example illustrating the presence of unexamined “dark money” in the U.S. education system.” It is “unclear” whether these funds should have been reported under section 117, the report notes.
“Harvard’s self-described improper vetting of domestic contributions raises questions about its foreign gifts and contract reporting procedures,” the report reads.

Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana dismissed the work of Charles A. Murray ’65 as “discredited” in a Tuesday interview — a few days after Murray spoke at a controversial webinar for Harvard affiliates.
In expressing his view, Khurana concurred with his colleague, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, who said in a recent interview that she does not believe Murray’s work has academic merit.
“I agree with Dean Gay. As a social scientist myself, this is not the first time I have come across this work,” Khurana said. “Very early in my academic career, the claims were basically discredited by people who had done deep work in this area.”
Khurana, a sociology professor and professor of leadership development at Harvard Business School, and Gay, a government and African and African American studies professor, are prominent members of the University’s faculty in the social sciences.
Government instructor David D. Kane invited Murray, who spoke about his 2020 book, “Human Diversity: The Biology of Gender, Race, and Class,” as part of a lecture series entitled “Data Scientists, Data Professionals, Data Dissidents.”
During the webinar, Murray — whose work the Southern Poverty Law Center terms “racist pseudoscience” — disputed the idea that race is a social construct and slammed the University’s faculty, arguing that they prioritize “social justice” over “Veritas,” meaning truth.
Faculty in attendance criticized Murray’s work, saying it makes unfounded claims and is rooted in flawed methodology. They criticized Kane, too, for both inviting Murray to speak and for disabling the public chat during the webinar. Kane did, however, allow attendees to submit questions via a private submission function.
Khurana said that all Harvard affiliates, and faculty in particular, have a responsibility to consider both the “academic merit” and community impact of inviting any speaker to campus.
“We should also make sure there's space for response to any perspective and point of view,” he said.
“I would not be comfortable ever being in an environment where it was one way: somebody got to say something and there was no interrogation and challenge on the other side,” Khurana added. “Each of us have a responsibility to speak up and speak out in intense debate when assertions are made that are rooted in prejudice, bigotry, and what I would call not very sophisticated uses of data.”
Murray’s webinar came two weeks after Government professor Kosuke Imai replaced Kane as course head of Government 50: “Data,” following student allegations that Kane authored racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog.
Students expressed hurt, shock, and anger in wake of the revelations. Some mobilized to call for Kane’s removal from his teaching role in a petition that garnered nearly 700 signatures from Harvard undergraduates, alumni, and organizations. Despite the petition, Kane will continue to give optional lectures for Gov 50 students and will continue leading the speaker series, which he has told students is unconnected to the course.
Khurana acknowledged the distress Kane’s alleged posts caused for Gov 50 students and other undergraduates.
“I recognize how painful this experience was, to have even any kind of suggestion that somehow people question your belongingness,” he said. “When we are hearing people who are talking about having experienced pain or having experienced marginalization, we have a responsibility to listen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s revenue dropped $138 million in fiscal year 2020, according to the University’s Annual Financial Report. The decline was concentrated in the last three months of the fiscal year.
The University ended the fiscal year with a net loss of $10 million in operating expenses, compared to a surplus of $308 million in 2019.
Total student revenue decreased by 11 percent, to $1.1 billion. Refunds the University issued to students ejected from the dorms midway through the spring semester amounted to $32 million, and room and board revenue fell by 16 percent.
Experts had previously predicted that the University would face considerable losses from cancelled and discounted executive education programs. Net revenue for executive and continuing education totaled $410 million, following a $90 million decline due in large part to coronavirus-related program cancellations and enrollment declines.
Despite those losses, Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister and Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan credited Harvard with implementing “cost control efforts” in the pandemic’s early stages.
“The loss would have been far greater without the implementation of immediate cost control efforts including cuts in discretionary spending, a freeze in new hires and raises, no bonuses or overtime work, voluntary salary cuts by senior leadership, and reduced capital spending,” Hollister and Finnegan wrote in the report.
Hollister and Finnegan also noted that the University had increased its financial aid payments by 5 percent, to total $645 million in scholarships.
The University remains focused on reducing spending to match declining revenues, finding promising investments, and staying “liquid.” Still, the pair wrote that the University could face financial challenges in the months ahead.
Harvard faces a 13 percent decrease in gift pledges compared to a year ago. Because endowment distributions and gifts constitute 46 percent of the University’s annual revenue, seeking out philanthropists remains among the University’s outstanding challenges, Hollister and Finnegan wrote.
Overall, the University’s net assets increased by $893 million to $50.2 billion as of June 30, 2020, in large part due to strong returns from Harvard Management Company.
HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced in September that the endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments in 2020. It now totals $41.9 billion, the largest sum in its history.
Narvekar wrote Thursday that Harvard has made progress on reducing its exposure to illiquid assets, including natural resources, long a source of losses for the endowment.
In addition, Narvekar wrote that 55 percent of HMC’s senior staff members are “either ethnic and racial minorities or women.” HMC had previously faced pressure from members of Congress to release diversity data.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow credited the school’s “strong fiscal management,” but acknowledged the potential challenges still ahead for the University.
“How we manage declining revenue and rising need for investment in excellence amid new and necessary health protocols will, in part, determine our successors’ ability to endure and thrive. Fortunately, the people of Harvard—and alumni and friends around the world—have come together to see the institution through uncertainty for generations,” Bacow wrote.

Dear Friend I Haven’t Spoken To Since April,
The first time we met, we just clicked. You are so funny, smart and interesting — I could listen to you ramble about your crazy day for hours. We didn’t see each other nearly enough when we were still on campus, but it always made my day when we did, especially when we bumped into each other in CVS, finally met up for a meal, or found out we were taking a class together and could be pset buddies. You are the best!
I’m really sorry I haven’t checked in recently — like, not once in the last few, uh, months. It sounds cheesy, but I promise that it’s not you, it’s me. You might have noticed that the year has been really rough. The world seems to be on fire and everything is uncertain. On top of that, I. Hate. Zoom calls. I could send a When2meet and schedule a catch up Zoom, but if I’m being honest, I know there isn’t much to talk about. I love you just as much as I always have, and I genuinely care about how you are and what you’re up to, but the Zoom fatigue is real. And I mean, you haven’t reached out to me, either — so I’m pretty sure you’re on the same page.
All I want is to go back in time so that we can spend more time hanging out in person. More wanderings into Boston, more late-night Jefe’s runs, more weird debates over what belly buttons would do if they were actual buttons. I just really miss you, and I’m looking forward to seeing you again sometime soon. And if you’re reading this, please remember that I love you to pieces, even if I don’t say it nearly enough. Please forgive me for being a less than perfect friend. I promise I’m still here, and I will smash through my Zoom screen to be by your side whenever you need me. This is both an apology and a love letter. I value your friendship and can’t wait to see you again soon to make some blessed (cursed?) new memories with you.
With love,
Georgia
