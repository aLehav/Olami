After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chants of “Sin justicia, no hay paz,” Spanish for “without justice, there is no peace,” filled Harvard Yard Friday as about 30 students gathered outside Massachusetts Hall to protest the findings in a report alleging environmental damage by two Harvard-owned timber companies in Argentina.
The report, released Tuesday and published by the California think tank Oakland Institute and the student group Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, alleged that the timber companies are responsible for lower water levels, high levels of dust, and non-compliance to fire codes endangering the homes of those who live near the plantations.
Organized by Responsible Investment, the protest started on the steps of Widener Library, before marching to Mass. Hall, where four students left a copy of the report as well as a letter to University President Drew G. Faust signed by Argentine environmental groups, agricultural worker associations, and the area’s local Catholic Church.
The letter, about half a page long, outlined the grievances of those living around the Ibera Wetlands, where the timber plantations are located.
“Your university’s lands are dedicated to an exploitive and extractive activity that is the worst enemy of our communities and our ecosystems,” the letter states, referring to the alleged deleterious practices of the timber companies on the plantations.
The letter also asks that President Faust advocate for the removal of plantations within two kilometers of  habitation and for a ban on the expansion of plantations until the completion of a study on their impact. It asks that the University honor those requests within 15 days of receiving the letter.
“I hope that Drew Faust will give the communities what they are asking for, but I expect that she will not,” said Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, a member of Responsible Investment who helped organize the rally.
“More work will be needed to convince the University administration that the use of Harvard’s investment is important to students,” Bayard added.
In a statement emailed Tuesday, University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote that the Harvard-owned timber companies are “in compliance with, or exceeding, all applicable rules and regulations in order to minimize impact to the wetland.”
“Both sites are operating with the full support of the local authorities and neither has been subject to an environmental or labor claim by the Argentine authorities,” Galvin wrote.
According to Michael E. Danto ’13-’14, those living around the Ibera Wetlands are considering pursuing legal action against the timber companies, but are waiting on Faust’s response before doing so.
“If Harvard decides to reform, then it might not prove necessary for the groups in Argentina to file formal legal complaints,” Danto said, adding that the groups might face difficulties filing a lawsuit in the area and troubles negotiating with the local government.
After one last march around Mass. Hall, the protesters vowed to return in 15 days if they have not received a response from the University.
“The whole Harvard community is impacted by Harvard’s investments, so we all have a responsibility to see that those investments are responsible,” Bayard said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Students gathered in the Graduate School of Education’s Gutman Conference Center on Friday for a fair on careers in federal, state, and local government—an event which would have been scaled down had the government shutdown not ended Thursday.
The fair was hosted by schools across the University as well as the Institute of Politics. The event, which encouraged students to “think beyond the shutdown," drew employers from careers ranging from the Cambridge City Council to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to the White House Internship program.
 
The event, coordinated by the Office of Career Services, was designed to connect students to potential employers. Students said the “meet up” allowed them to network with representatives from government organizations, hand out their resumes, and learn how to they might break into careers in the public sector.
 
“This is a great chance for me to network, ask questions, and see people face to face,” Happy Yang ’16 said.
 
Many attendees at the event said they believed that the shutdown might lead more students to be interested in jobs in government after graduation.
 
“I think students will have more incentive to join the government because there is so much room for improvement,” said Cheryl Y. Campos ’15, a student ambassador for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“Students want to help solve the problems of today,” added Campos, who is also an inactive Crimson news editor.
 
As the end of on-campus recruitment winds down, IOP Internships and Career Services Coordinator Sadie Polen said that for some the path to politics and public service isn’t as clear as other opportunities on campus.
 “But for the summer, during the academic year, and post-graduation, there are many opportunities for undergraduates interested in public service,” Polen added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rahm Emanuel, Mayor of Chicago and former White House Chief of Staff, spoke at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Friday afternoon, talking at length about his successes as mayor and emphasizing reforms he has implemented to the city’s schools since taking office.
The event was held in the style of an interview, led by Lois Romano, senior political reporter at Politico.
Emanuel began by pointing out the importance of cities as the epicenters of progress and innovation amid frequent political stalemates at the federal level. He then said that under his leadership Chicago has come to represent the nation’s urban-fueled growth.
“Chicago is the only city in all of North America … to move into the top ten rankings for worldwide economic competitiveness,” Emanuel said, citing a report published by the Economist this year. 
He attributed this accomplishment to the many Fortune 100 companies located in the city, but stressed the value of the Chicago’s many universities and community colleges in making the city such a global economic force.
During his term, Emanuel has overseen a number of infrastructural improvements, including the expansion of O’Hare Airport, the replacement of all buses and trains in Chicago’s public transit system, and the renovation of every station in the city’s transportation network.
Emanuel has also implemented major changes in the city’s education system. Under his leadership, Emanuel said public schools across the city have undergone significant capital improvements, financed by the reallocation of funds after the closure of some 50 under-enrolled schools in the city’s system. He also said he has pushed for more rigorous academics and a longer school day.
“We have now given the children of the City of Chicago a full school day and a full school year for the first time,” Emanuel said.
Emanuel highlighted the importance of such changes, pointing out the demonstrated ability of cities to champion their own causes. Aside from only a few programs, Emanuel said “you can’t tell me a single thing the federal government has done for children in the last 50 years.”
Though politics in Chicago are not without conflict, Emanuel said the city was still able to make improvements in spite of the tension.
“The political system might be embattled, but the kids are better off,” Emanuel said.
Despite the city’s progress, especially with regards to making the community colleges more viable, Emanuel said that he is not an educational reformer.
Breaking from the topic of education, Romano challenged the mayor on the crime rate in Chicago, which she said had been dubbed the country’s murder capital.
Emanuel responded by citing a recent decrease in the city’s crime rate and attributing the city’s high gun crime rate to its geography. He drew attention to the lax gun laws of neighbor states and the city’s role as a national transportation hub to account for the large presence of guns in Chicago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of the world flocked to Cambridge for the Head of the Charles Regatta, Harvard field hockey (5-6, 1-3 Ivy) departed for a pair of games in New York this weekend against Ivy opponent Cornell (7-5, 2-2) and Colgate (3-12, 1-3 Patriot League).
HARVARD 5, COLGATE 2
The Harvard offense came alive against the Raiders on Sunday as the team scored more goals than it has in any game all season, defeating Colgate 5-2.
Freshman Marissa Balleza gave the Crimson an early lead that it would never give up as she scored twice in the first half. Her first goal came only ten minutes into the game, off of a pass from Catriona McDonald that shot past Raider goalkeeper Caitlin Zoelt.
Balleza then increased Harvard’s lead 20 minutes later off a hard shot from the top of the circle, after she stole the ball from a Colgate defender.
Senior forward Rachael Rosenfeld stole the show in the second half, scoring two goals in under two minutes to increase the Crimson lead. The first goal was a tip in from a pass dished by sophomore back Elizabeth Jacobson, and the second came from a pass Rosenfeld received from junior midfielder Caitlin Rea across the circle.
“We’re really focusing on scoring” junior forward Noel Painter said. “We’ve certainly improved in the past few games but it’s going to need to get even better for the next few games.”
Harvard junior forward Kaitlyn Boudah also scored in the second half off an assist from McDonald.
Seniors Kelsey Jensen and Halle Biggar scored the two Raider goals. Jensen’s goal in the first half came off of a corner in which Colgate set up a fake shot by Rebecca Libutti, while Eliana Brown dished a pass to Jensen who snuck it past Crimson senior goalie Jenn Hatfield’s pads. Biggar converted on a rebound following a tough stop by the goalkeeper.
Hatfield was a force in the net as a late Colgate attack sent more action her way. The senior had six saves in the game, her third highest total this season.
“We know we have the ability to step up and play our game,” Jacobson said. “I think we definitely proved that this weekend after coming back from the [Cornell] loss.”
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 2
It was a Balleza battle as sisters Hannah, a Big Red senior, and Marissa, a Crimson freshman, took the field to face off against one another in an Ancient Eight League matchup. In an offense-heavy game, both sisters were very involved in their team’s respective attacks.
Going into the game with a two game win streak, Harvard was prepared to face a tough conference opponent in Cornell, which was also coming off a three-game win streak of its own.
Hannah Balleza had all three assists in the Big Red’s 3-2 victory, with goals scored by Marisa Siergiej and Katy Weeks. All three came in the first half, putting the Crimson in an early hole.
Penalty corners were an issue for Harvard, as both of Siergiej’s goals came off of corners. Over the course of the game, Harvard gave up nine penalty corners, compared to Cornell’s four.
A second half offensive push gave the Crimson a chance to come back, but the team fell just short. Of Harvard’s six losses, four have been by only one goal.
“There was just something missing and I guess it just took us the first half to realize that we needed to finally step up” Jacobson said. “We definitely could have put up a bigger fight and at halftime we just realized we needed to pull together again and really focus on our goals.”
Marissa Balleza had an assist for the Crimson as she dished the ball to fellow freshman forward Sarah Finnemore in a two-on-one breakaway. The two have had a strong showing thus far in their first collegiate seasons, with both earning Ivy League rookie of the week honors. Balleza has six goals on the season and leads the team in overall points, while Finnemore has contributed four goals for Harvard.
Painter also scored for the Crimson as she slipped the ball past Big Red goalkeeper Carolyn Horner with a reverse stick shot. Freshman Sophie van Weede had the assist.
Despite a few last minute scoring attempts, Harvard was unable to convert on net as the Cornell defense held strong. Horner especially prevented the Crimson from coming back, as Jacobson managed a hard shot in the final ten minutes, earning the win for the Big Red.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a big win two weeks ago against Brown, the Harvard women’s rugby team (3-2, 3-1 Ivy) looked to continue its late season charge and secure an automatic berth into the Ivy League Championships with a victory this weekend. The pressure was on for the Crimson to perform in its final regular season contest against Princeton, a perennial rugby threat.
“We knew after an extremely inspired performance against Brown [that] this was a real test for us to see if we could carry that intensity over and bring it to two games in a row,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said.
With its post-season on the line, Harvard delivered a dominating performance, blanking the Tigers in a 36-0 victory.
“It was such a great team effort today,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “It was so good to see everyone come out with a high effort—with that same level of intensity—and step up their awareness on the field. It was amazing. These guys blew it out of the water.”
Despite a relatively slow start in the first few minutes, the Crimson quickly picked up steam, consistently putting the pressure back on Princeton.
“Even with some dips in our intensity in the first half, we were able to pull it together in the second half and step on their throats,” Parker said. “I’m extremely proud of them. It was a huge team effort.”
Junior Aniebiet Abasi got Harvard on the board 15 minutes into the contest. After being fed a pass by Brown, Abasi sprinted past the Tigers’ defense to register the Crimson’s first try of the afternoon. Brown’s conversion kick split the posts, putting Harvard up 7-0.
The Crimson defense came up with an important stop less than ten minutes later to retain the lead. With Princeton just yards away from the try zone and knocking at the door, Harvard successfully fended off the Tigers’ charge. With Harvard back in possession, Brown registered another try and conversion with seven minutes left, giving the Crimson a 14-0 lead at the half.
Harvard came out firing in the second half of the contest. The Crimson added to its lead less than ten minutes later when senior Cayla Calderwood ran in another try. Brown’s conversion pushed Harvard’s lead to 21-0. Brown added two more tries and fellow co-captain Ali Haber notched another to round out the Crimson’s scoring in the 36-0 routing.
Harvard’s success was in a large part due to the strong performance of its forward line. The trio of Meghan Laughner, Ariel Churchill, and Helen Clark were a key part of the Crimson’s offensive attack, undaunted by the task of facing the Princeton’s huge front row.
“The forwards dominated today,” Brown said. “Princeton always brings a big team and a big pack, and our forwards came in and just knocked them out of the way on contact on everything.”
With the win in its final regular season contest, Harvard earned an automatic bid into the Ivy League Championships and avoided a play-in match against Cornell next weekend. The win further boosted the Crimson’s confidence as it heads into post-season play.
“We needed to prove to ourselves that the game against Brown was not a fluke,” Parker said. “I think they did that in spades. And they brought so much more tactical awareness to this game. It showed in our ability to dominate possession. We dominated territory, and we put up a fair number of points.”
The team is trending towards peak form as it eyes the Ivy League Championships in less than two weeks.
“I think that first Ivy League contest against Dartmouth where we came out really flat, it just became apparent that this was not going to cut it in this Ivy League,” Brown said. “We looked around and this team said, ‘That’s fine, let’s step it up.’ And we did. Since then, this team has been on the rise. I cannot express how excited I am.”
With a No. 2 seeding in the conference championship, Harvard looks to cap its inaugural season as a varsity program with an Ancient Eight title.
“We’ve got a rematch against Brown in the first round and then we’ve got Dartmouth,” Brown said. “This team is so excited to see Dartmouth again. They’re not going to see the same team they saw a few weeks ago and they will not know what hit them. We can’t wait for Ivy’s."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite getting inside Harvard’s 30-yard line three times heading into the final quarter, the Lafayette football team (1-4) came away with only three points in as many quarters. The Harvard first-team defense forced four turnovers to lead the team to a win in its final non-conference game of the season.
Harvard (4-0, 2-0 Ivy), with five games left in the season, now totals 17 turnovers in 2013, just one shy of last season’s 18. After the first series of the game, when senior quarterback Michael Pruneau found senior tight end Cameron Brate for a two-yard score off of a fake field goal, the Crimson offense stalled, punting on both of its remaining first-quarter drives. Then, the defense did what it’s done all season.
On a crucial third and five deep in Harvard’s territory, a ball thrown by Lafayette quarterback Andrew Dzurik was tipped and landed in the hands of junior linebacker Connor Sheehan. Sheehan returned the interception 35 yards to give the Crimson a short field to work with. 45 yards later, sophomore Paul Stanton found the end zone to give Harvard a 14-0 lead.
“The seniority and experience in the secondary is a big part of it,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve got five senior defensive backs, and they’re really in sync.”
But the Crimson defense wasn’t done. It would pick off Dzurik again in the first half and freshman quarterback Drew Reed early in the second to bring its interception total to nine on the season. Though the offense was unable to capitalize on these picks with points, the interceptions pinned Lafayette back in its own territory and broke any momentum the Leopards were able to create.
On Lafayette’s first drive of the fourth quarter, with his team down, 21-3, Reed recovered a fumble dropped by running back Greg Kessel. One play later, Reed completed a pass to tailback Ross Scheurman that put Lafayette inside the red zone, but junior cornerback Hayes knocked the ball loose on the tackle, and sophomore linebacker Eric Medes fell on top of it.
Three plays later, Pruneau hit wide-open sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer, who sprinted 50 yards into the end zone to put Harvard up, 28-3, and effectively shut down any chance of a Lafayette comeback—one three-and-out drive by the Leopards later, Harvard’s first-team defense left the field. Medes’ fumble recovery was the team’s eighth of the season, surpassing last season’s tally of seven.
TROUBLE UNDER CENTER
While the Crimson hasn’t had its starting quarterback, junior Conner Hempel, since last week’s game against Cornell, the Leopards have been missing starter Zach Zweizig since the second quarter of their Week 3 contest against Penn.
Dzurik filled in for Zweizig, leading Lafayette to a win over Bucknell, but struggled in the first half against Harvard. The sophomore was 7-for-17 for 92 yards with two picks, leading Leopards coach Frank Tavani’s decision to replace him with Reed after halftime.
“Andrew’s done some really good things, but there were just too many bad decisions, overthrows, and you just can’t continue to do that,” Tavani said.
Reed’s entrance into the game was his first time getting collegiate playing time, and the inexperience showed early. In Lafayette’s opening drive of the second half, Reed targeted tight end Brandon Hall, but senior cornerback DJ Monroe jumped in front of Hall and handed Reed his first career interception.
The freshman would finish with over 200 yards passing, but much of this occurred against Harvard’s second-team defense after the Crimson was well ahead.
“There are some positions you can actually play as a freshman, but playing quarterback as a freshman is extraordinarily difficult,” Murphy said. “There’s so much to learn, so much to see and you can really exploit a freshman quarterback with very few exceptions.”
FOURTH QUARTER SHOOTOUT
Despite being up 21-3 entering the final quarter, the Harvard offense never let off the gas, finding the end zone twice more before time wound down. After passing for 115 yards in the first three quarters, Pruneau surpassed that number in the last 15 minutes, throwing for two touchdowns and 148 yards.
A large portion of that yardage came from the scoring drive following Medes’ fumble recovery early in the fourth quarter. Pruneau found senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn and then Fischer on back-to-back passes of 37 and 50 yards to record his longest completions of the game.
“They were blitzing almost every single play,” Murphy said. “So your choices are, you get two yards or you get more yards, and so it was an easy choice. Our philosophy is to take what they give you and try to be a balanced offense.”
A fake punt on the Crimson’s next drive extended the drive when Medes misinterpreted a coach’s signal on the sideline and gained a first down, moving the chains from Harvard’s 44-yard line to Lafayette’s red zone. But the Crimson was unable to exploit its field position as Pruneau fumbled the ball two plays later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It always happens so fast.
One second, Harvard’s opponent is driving. This week, it was Lafayette, which opened the fourth quarter at the Crimson’s 22-yard line. Down 21-3, a touchdown would have made things interesting with plenty of time left.
But against the Harvard defense, that was never a real possibility. On 3rd and eight, running back Ross Scheuerman neared the first down marker, but a measurement wouldn’t be necessary. Waiting for Scheuerman in the flat, senior Brian Owusu put his head in the running’s back chest, popping the football free.
Sophomore linebacker Eric Medes was there to land on it, and Harvard’s offense needed just over a minute to move the ball 81 yards the other way. Sophomore Andrew Fischer’s 50-yard touchdown catch-and-run gave the Crimson a 28-3 lead. The Leopards were done.
The 35-16 win was Harvard’s 15th straight at home, though it feels like it’s been 150 games since the Crimson have let a home game slip away. They always seem to go the same way: just when an opponent shows a breath of life, the Harvard defense steps on its neck.
This week, it was Owusu’s forced fumble. Last week against Cornell, a pair of sacks set up an impossible 4th and 27 on the Big Red’s final drive. Senior Jaron Wilson had the honor of performing the execution ceremony in Week Two, when his pick-six separated Harvard from Brown. I could go on and on.
The Harvard defense leads the Ivy League in both interceptions and forced fumbles. And the Crimson D isn’t content to just fall on the ball. Defenders have tallied 146 yards on their nine interceptions. That’s nearly as many as every other Ivy team combined. For comparison, Cornell’s running attack on offense has only tallied 173 yards thus far.
It’s easy to write about the interceptions and the subsequent returns. Connor Sheehan’s 35-yard interception return across midfield Saturday is the stuff of a sportswriter’s dreams. But that’s not when Harvard’s defense is at its best.
The Crimson is at its best when nothing happens—when the defensive backs stay with their receivers and the defensive linemen fill their gaps. They aren’t the flashy plays, but they’re suffocating. Ask Scheuerman how it feels to get stuffed for two yards or fewer a dozen times. The pile of plays for no gain might not impress fans, but it infuriates opponents.
And it forces risky choices. Eventually, teams like Lafayette try a deep pass or try to gain an extra yard on a run, giving the Crimson the chance it’s been waiting for—the opportunity to deal the knockout blow. When given the chance, Harvard has consistently landed that knockdown punch.
Well, except for once. Every player of the Crimson football team already knows what I’m talking about.
Oct. 20, 2012.
Harvard led Princeton 34-10 with 12 minutes left in the game. But then the Crimson special teams gave up a 59-yard kickoff return. The special teams also let the Tigers block both a Harvard punt and field goal attempt.
The Crimson offense failed to score a touchdown on first, second, and third and goal. It came up a yard short on a crucial 3rd and seven.
Meanwhile, the Harvard defense gave up 251 yards in the fourth quarter, not including two successful two-point conversions. Princeton had seven plays of 15 yards or more along the way. The most painful for the Crimson was the last one, a 36-yard touchdown pass with eight seconds left that put the Tigers up for the first time, 39-34. That only came after an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty turned a seven-yard sack into an eight-yard gain and a first down.
So many chances to land the knockout, but Harvard whiffed on each of them, costing it a chance at an Ivy title.
Since then, the Crimson has been on a mission. Each of its wins has come by double digits as Harvard has rarely missed a chance to stomp on an opponent’s neck. But Saturday, when Princeton comes to town, we will finally find out if things are truly different this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite their similar records, the two teams that squared off at Soldiers Field Saturday evening were coming from two very different points in their season: Harvard (3-6-2, Ivy 2-1-0) had just come off of an upset of defending league champion Cornell while Brown (3-6-3, 0-1-2) was seeking its first win since October 1st.
The Bears will have to wait for their next game to end their now-four game losing streak, however, as the Crimson emerged victorious, 2-1, for its second straight Ivy League win since opening conference play with a last-minute loss to Yale.
The first half saw the majority of activity from the Crimson offense, as Harvard had multiple chances to score. Senior midfielder Ross Friedman had two opportunities just 80 seconds into the game, with one being blocked by Bears keeper Josh Weiner and another stopped by a Brown defender.
Forward Daniel Smith and sophomore defender Mark Ashby also both had headers that just missed the goal in the early going.
The first goal of the game came from Ashby’s second effort on the goal, as he fielded the rebound from Friedman’s 30-foot strike to put the ball into the net.
Harvard’s second goal was more straightforward, as freshman midfielder Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu ran down a long ball along the right sideline and sent a cross that flew by most of the Bears’ defenders. Freshman forward Ashi Geberkidane got position on his shorter defender and flew in to head the ball cleanly into the goal, netting what proved to be the deciding goal for the Crimson. The goal put Harvard in unprecedented territory, as it marked the team’s first 2-0 advantage of the entire year
“The first 20 minutes of the game was probably the best offense we played all year, maybe in a few years, honestly,” senior midfielder Kevin Harrington said. “I think we could have had three or four goals, no problem.”
Brown retaliated with a header goal of its own in the 36th minute, as senior forward Voltaire Escalona set up sophomore midfielder Jack Gorab for the Bears only goal of the game.
According to coach Pieter Lehrer, Harvard had more energy coming into this game and, since Ivy League play began, has displayed tremendous heart after suffering a difficult loss to open conference play.
“The guys are obviously fighting, and their play is improving with their fight”, said head coach Pieter Lehrer. “It’s the same thing on the practice field, it’s been our possession on training is a lot better. We’re getting a lot calmer on our attacking half. We’re executing our set pieces, so it’s good.”
Harvard’s sophomore keeper Evan Mendez came up with numerous clutch, diving stops and ended with six saves. He remains undefeated for the season with a 3-0-1 record. His counterpart on the Brown side, senior Josh Weiner, notched five saves of his own.
“When you put everything out on the line, sometimes you’re going to lose, but you have to put it all out on the line”, said Lehrer, regarding the talk he had with his players after the Yale defeat.  “That was the result that night, but as we keep putting it out there, the results are going to change to our favor.”
Though all the scoring came in the first 36 minutes of the first half, the second half did not lack excitement. Brown maintained strong offensive pressure throughout the half, culminating in the 87th minute, when junior defender Alex Markes sent a cross towards the right side of the goal which collided solidly with the right goalpost. Markes’ shot was the closest that the Bears came to tying the game, as Harvard was able to prevent Brown from coming any closer in the remaining minutes.
“With the lead, we knew they’d be putting a lot of offensive pressure on us … so we knew they were going to come out and score as many goals as they possibly could”, Harrington said. “The back line maintained pressure on the ball and maintained high line, and [didn’t just sit back and take] pressure after pressure and attack after attack. I thought this game was a vast improvement.

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team started its season strong Saturday afternoon in a physical exhibition game against McGill at the Bright Hockey Center. In its first game without previous head coach Katey Stone since 1994, the Crimson was able to take down the Martlets, 5-2. The win marked Harvard’s eighth consecutive exhibition victory over McGill.
“It was a good starting point for us,” said interim Crimson coach Maura Crowell. “It’s great to have an exhibition game at the start of our season to see what we have…. I think that with the way things went we should be pleased.”
Though the Crimson graduated a number of key players last year, including Jillian Dempsey ’13 and Laura Bellamy ’13, the team welcomed seven newcomers onto the ice on Saturday. The freshmen skated alongside just two seniors, four juniors, and five sophomore teammates.
“Everybody tells us we have a young team, so it’s always good to see how our players are going to adapt to a live game…. They handled [the pace] really well,” Crowell said.
Among the rookies, Sydney Daniels and Abigail Frazer displayed their shooting abilities, both finding the back of the net once.
“The freshmen didn’t play like freshmen, which is great,” said junior Samantha Reber, last season’s leader in points, “We are trying to get used to playing with each other and trying to get used to the system.”
The Crimson displayed its deep bench with five players each scored a goal. In addition to the freshmen, three familiar faces capitalized for Harvard.
Junior defenseman Sarah Edney scored the Crimson’s first goal, assisted by sophomore Jessica Harvey and senior Elizabeth Parker. Edney’s classmate, Hillary Crowe, later tapped in the Crimson’s third goal; Reber and Frazer assisted on that one. Early in the third, Reber, assisted by classmate Marissa Gedman, found the back of the net in a Harvard man-up opportunity.
McGill had four man-up opportunities, one of which came on a five-minute major penalty against Crimson player Sydney Daniels for throwing an elbow that left a Martlet prostrated on the ice.
Despite having several power plays and outshooting the Crimson 27-22, McGill was unable to score until late in the third period. For most of the game, 2013 Ivy League Rookie of the year winner Emerance Maschmeyer stonewalled the visitors. Maschmeyer tallied 20 saves in goal during the first two periods of play.
“We came out strong in the first—got a goal. [Then] held them to no goals for basically the whole game,” Reber said.
Rookie goalie Brianna Laing manned the cage for the final period of play. She totaled five saves in her first collegiate game. However, Martlets senior Leslie Oles managed to drive the puck into the goal twice in the last three minutes of play. Oles already had seven goals for the season coming into Saturday’s game.
“Towards the end of the game…we just started running around a little too much, something we can easily fix,” Reber said.
Crowell was not concerned about the Martlet’s two points.
“We will work out some more of our kinks as we go,” Crowell said. “[We] want to see consistent play throughout three periods and that is something that we will continue to work on…. We want to review why those goals were scored and be sure that everyone is learning the process”
Though Saturday’s game opened the season for Harvard, McGill already began their season coming into the matchup. The Martlets bested several of the Crimson’s Ivy rivals: Princeton, Dartmouth, and Yale. However, the Martlets fell to NCAA teams Providence and Northeastern.
The Harvard team has high expectations for this season. The Crimson had a successful 2012-2013 season, finishing with a record of 24-7-3 and the Ivy League title. The Harvard players and coaches are positive about the programs future.
“We’ve got a lot of potential and strengths on the team…[we have] speed and skill,” Reber said. “Everyone wants to see improvement from here until the end of the season.”
Harvard will face conference members Quinnipiac and Princeton at home next weekend.
“We’re feeling good,” Crowell said. “[We] are going to keep practicing and polishing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team entered this weekend’s roadtrip tied for second with Brown in the Ivy League and looked to continue its conference win streak against Penn and Princeton. The team leaves the weekend having solidified its number two spot in the conference trailing Yale, who is undefeated in the Ancient Eight.
The Crimson was able to come away with two victories, with a 3-1 match win over the Quakers Friday night at the Palestra and a 3-0 defeat of the Tigers on Saturday at Dillon Gymnasium.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
In a dominant performance by Harvard (10-6, 5-2 Ivy), the Crimson was able to close out its roadtrip undefeated and remain near the top of the Ivy League standings with its 3-0 blanking of Princeton (6-11, 2-5).
As has been the trend lately, freshmen Corinne Bain and Grace Weghorst showed that age is simply a number when it comes to talent on the court. For the second night in a row Bain recorded a triple-double with 10 kills, 22 assists, and 10 digs. Weghorst added eight kills, just ahead of senior right side hitter Erin Cooney and sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace who each had seven kills.
It was those powerful hitters that allowed Harvard to start the night out victorious and win the first set 29-27, propelling the team toward its ultimate victory. Tied 27-27, sophomore Hannah Schmidt set Bain up completed one of her 10 kills to put the Crimson up 28-27. An attack error by the Tigers sealed the Harvard victory.
From that point on the Crimson only trailed the Tigers once, during a 1-2 deficit at the beginning of the second set.
“It was a great win for us not only because we won all three games but also because it was on the road and very important for our Ivy League rankings,” Bain said.
The Tigers attack was led by junior middle blocker Tiana Woolridge who had 10 kills, followed by sophomore middle blocker Kendall Peterkin who notched 9 kills, and freshman outside hitter Cara Mattaliano who contributed 8 kills.
HARVARD 3, PENN 1
After starting the match out with a 28-26 battle that saw the Crimson take the first set, Harvard was able to put the Quakers (9-9, 3-4 Ivy) away in four frames.
Bain and Weghorst each had a strong game again for the Crimson. Weghorst led the team with 15 kills on the night, while Bain added 10 of her own. Bain also had 22 assists and added four service aces in the win. Wallace and junior Caroline Walters also contributed nine kills each throughout the contest.
“Everyone was doing their job; we had a ton of digs and an equal amount of great sets,” Weghorst said. “They gave me the ball whenever they could and whenever it was smart to do so and I was able to put it away when I could.”
The game started out slow for the Crimson, who had four hitting errors in a row which allowed Penn to go ahead 11-8 in the first set, but the team was able to rally back after a timeout to win the set 28-26. A kill from Wallace solidified Harvard’s victory in the first set.
“That probably was our motivation [to keep playing strong],” Weghorst said. “We knew that we were able to rally and come back from a bit of a deficit so we were able to come together and use that as our motivation to play as hard as we can and win the next game.”
Although Harvard dropped the third frame after Penn closed the set on a seven-point run, the Crimson was able to bounce back and take the fourth set, 25-21. Harvard opened the set with a 4-0 run and did not look back from then on, not allowing a single lead change through the final stana.
“It was a great match, I think we came out with a lot of enthusiasm and energy because we knew that we needed to take care of business on the road,” Bain said. “We’re really proud of how we were able to bounce back from our last road trip and get the win this week.”
The victories allowed Harvard to be the sole holder of second place in the Ivy League, with Brown splitting their weekend play against Columbia and Cornell. Only the undefeated Bulldogs of New Haven stand in the way of the Crimson’s first Ivy League Championship since 2004.
“This win feels really good,” Bain said. “It is really essential for our team’s confidence going into the second half of Ivy League play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a gorgeous Sunday afternoon, Radcliffe heavyweight and lightweight crew both took to the Charles to race against some of the best competition in the world in the 49th edition of the Head of the Charles Regatta.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In both the Club and Championship divisions, the Crimson placed highly. The heavyweight club eight rowed to a course record, posting a time of 16:41.930—including a final split of 2:54.995—to best Brown. The Club Eight was coxed by junior Victoria Lellis with sophomore Rose Traubert in the bow, followed by junior Eleanor Parker, freshman Emily Gaudiani, freshman Abigail Parker, sophomore Sofia Jonas, freshman Kelsey Barolak, senior Maura Church and freshman Isabella Benduski.
Radcliffe raced two boats in the championship division. The first varsity boat place seventh, with a time of 17:00.641, finishing behind the Cambridge Boat Club team and the USRowing Boat. Junior Jenny Wong coxed the boat, with sophomore Mary Carmack, senior Deva Steketee, junior Mimi Tanski, sophomore Lauren Tracey, sophomore Rederika Archibald, senior Katie Wilcox, junior Elizabeth Fitzhenry and senior Jenny Gregiore on oars. The second varsity boat placed 33rd.
The Black and White also entered a boat in the championship fours, placing 16th overall with a time of 19:53.992
“Across the board we are all really happy with our performance,” Tracey said.
The Head of the Charles is the highlight of a relatively slow fall season, but competing against a high level of competition provides Radcliffe with a barometer for its spring performance.
“It’s October,” Tracey said. “This is a stepping stone, [albeit] a big stepping stone. We are always looking to get stronger as a team, for everyone to get stronger. This team has a chance to be really awesome in the spring.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Radcliffe lightweight team performed strong as well, including a stellar second place finish by the first varsity boat.
Finishing with a time of 17:15.232, the Black and White edged out Wisconsin for the best collegiate finish by over six seconds. Only Minerva Rowing Club out of the Netherlands finished ahead of the Radcliffe crew. The first varsity boat was coxed by senior Erin Driscoll, with sophomore Gabrielle McNeill, junior Claire Harmange, freshman Ruby Emberling, sophomore Naomi Lang, senior Katherine Mallet, junior Elizabeth MacEachern, junior Adelaide Backer and senior Elizabeth Lenczowski rowing.
“It was a great start to the season, we were really happy to finish first out of the collegiate eights,” said Lenczowski “It was a really strong showing.”
The Black White also delivered a strong showing in the championships four division, ranking third with a time of 20:01.652.  The boat rowed by Olivia Henry, Devi Lockwood, Taylor Garden and Andrea Linares and coxed by Gabrielle Giugliano finished less than two seconds behind second place UMass.
The lightweight team had been practicing all fall without an official head coach, due to the transition of its former coach to the men’s lightweight team.
“We’ve been fortunate to have our assistant coach Lauren Fisher and she has been assisting us throughout the fall and in preparation for the Head of the Charles,” Lenczowski said.
Next week, new head coach Lou Berl will step in after leaving her position as the head of the Trinity College team, her alma mater. She led the Bantams to both regional and NCAA championship race appearances.
Along with acting as a litmus test for the teams going into the spring season, the Head of the Charles serves as a celebration for all rowers, including those on the Radcliffe squad. An estimated 400,000 spectators came to watch the races.
“The great thing about the Head of the Charles is a big family reunion for all the rowers,” Tracey said. “I got to see some of my friends who row at other schools. My friend described it as a ‘Rower Christmas.’ This is my fifth year rowing here, and still having all those people cheering for you is really exciting.”
Along with rowers from all over, Radcliffe rowing alums come back to support the present boats.
“It is pretty amazing to be part of the race and to have so much support and to have so much support from the Harvard rowing community,” Lenczowiski said. “A lot of our alums come back and cheer us on and it’s a really fun weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Hosting 9,000 other competitors on the Charles River this weekend, both the Harvard’s men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams turned in strong performances at the Head of the Charles regatta, with both of the first eight boats finishing in the top three of their events. 
HEAVYWEIGHTS
Last year, the Harvard heavyweight crew team saw its first-place finish snatched away from it after a 10-second buoy violation was repealed from the University of Washington. This year the Crimson was unable to reclaim its top ranked position, falling to third place behind OTC Amsterdam and USRowing in collegiate men’s eights. 
Harvard finished the race with a time of 14:43.027, 1.86 seconds slower than top finisher OTC Amsterdam, and .38 seconds slower than runner-up USRowing, which suffered a three-minute penalty last year after interfering with other boats twice. 
Members of the Crimson were satisfied finishing behind two teams that compete on an international level. 
“We’re very pleased with our finish because it was an extremely strong field,” junior five-seat Ed Rippon said. “The two boats that beat us were both world champions and national team rowers so for a college crew to get so close to them was really pleasing. We put in a strong performance against all the other colleges so we’re proud of that too.”
One college in particular that Harvard was looking to beat this year was Washington after the Huskies took the first place title over the Crimson in last year’s regatta. The team succeeded in this feat, with Washington finishing ninth in the race with a time of 14:55.482. 
“It feels really really great [to beat Washington], I can’t really describe it,” Rippon said. “They have always pushed us in the races the last few years and they are a really strong and talented group of guys so we are really happy to get one over them for a change.” 
The first freshman boat also competed in men’s champion eights and finished 21st overall. Harvard’s third entry finished 28st with a time of 16:01.540. 
The two men’s championship-four boats finished eighth and 18th in their race earlier Sunday afternoon. 
On Saturday, the Crimson heavyweights entered two boats in men’s club eights. They finished fourth and 11th, respectively. The sole Harvard competitor in club men’s fours finished its race in 20th place. 
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Harvard lightweight crew team entered the Head of the Charles with a target on its back, entering undefeated for the past two seasons and bringing back-to-back gold medals at EARC Sprints and IRA National Championships home to Cambridge. 
This streak, however, was snapped on Sunday when the first men’s lightweight eights boat finished behind Princeton by 8.54 seconds. Last year, the Crimson won the race handily, beating out USRowing by 11.72 seconds. 
The team has gone through a lot of changes in the past year, losing longtime coach Charley Butt to the heavyweight team while Radcliffe women’s lightweight coach Michiel Bartman was called upon to fill the coaching void on the men’s lightweight team. This year’s first eight boat only saw two rowers return, with six out of the first eight from last year graduating in the spring. 
“We are a very young crew, so it will take time [to mesh as a team], but we are confident that we can find the speed we need when it really matters in the spring,” junior stroke Alex Bonorris said. “Michiel is a fantastic coach…and we are really excited to continue improving under his routine.”
Although many were emphasizing the need to continue to succeed at an undefeated level, this opening race of the season is just a starting point for the rest of the races to come for the lightweights. 
“This year we have a totally new crew so it’s going to be one of those times where we are going to have to build one race at a time and when we get it right, we’ll get it right,” junior seven-seat Andrew Campbell said. “And we’re going to get it right.” 
For the lightweight fours, the race did not produce the same level of confidence as the first eights experienced. The team was penalized one minute for colliding with Argonaut under the Weeks footbridge. The penalty knocked the Crimson into last place for the event, finishing with an official time of 19:41.643. 
“It’s just one of those unfortunate things that happens,” junior stoke Eli Leavitt said. “That’s not going to affect how we race in March, April, and May when it really matters.” 
On the club competition level, the lightweights first freshman boat in men’s club eights finished in ninth place overall with a time of 15:36.721.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the placement of Harvard’s boats in two races. Harvard’s third entry took 28th, not 31st, in men’s heavyweight champion eights, while another Harvard boat took fourth, not fifth, in men’s heavyweight club eights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (8-3-1, Ivy 4-0) propelled itself past the Bears on Saturday afternoon at Soldiers Field in a 3-1 victory, its fourth straight win in the Ivy conference.
But the Crimson started slow.  Brown led the way with a quick goal six minutes into the first half.
“They’re a good team, so they took advantage of our mistakes,” freshman forward Joan Fleischman said.
Co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson called the early goal a good lesson.
“Getting scored on early is always tough, and it’s a really good learning experience for us to hopefully not have that happen again and learn that when we’re in that situation, we are able to come back,” Johnson said.
But the team did not change its general strategy or lose its composure in reaction to Brown’s goal.
“We wanted to keep it simple,” Johnson said.  “We didn’t want to overthink it or get wrapped up in any one moment.  We wanted to make sure we continued to do the things we’d worked on in practice and focus on ourselves.”
With 25:45 seconds to go in the first half, freshman forward Midge Purce sent a free kick into the box, and sophomore midfielder Haley Washburn finished it off with a header straight into the top of the net to tie things up.
The Crimson and the Bears remained tied for the rest of the first half.  Notable shots came from a side-post shot by co-captain Elizabeth Weisman and a bicycle kick from Purce snatched out of the air by Brown’s goalie wih seven minutes to go,
“We ended the first half knowing that we’d had a lot of really good chances and knowing that if we just kept playing our game and doing what we had been doing for another 45 [minutes], we’d get the results we wanted,” Johnson said.
But the Crimson would not be content with a tie.
“It was good that we tied it up, but we knew that that wasn’t enough and we had to come out stronger than we had before and focus on this [second] 45 minutes and not on anything else,” Fleischman said.
Purce, assisted by Fleischman, scored a goal right off the bat in the second half, only to be called offsides.  But the setback did not deter Harvard from piling on the pressure.
“It showed that we weren’t going to be content with a tie, and we were going to keep going after them,” Fleischman said.  “Even though that one [goal] got called back it really motivated us to go for the second and third.”
About 11 minutes into the second half, the Crimson found the back of the net again.  Junior midfielder Marie Margolius put in another header off an assist from sophomore defender Alika Keene.
Twelve minutes later, Weisman added another goal off an assist from Margolius.
“It was pretty fast-paced, especially toward the end of the second half,” Fleischman said.  “We were just really able to use our fitness, our subs, and our legs to maintain control of the tempo.”
But Brown had its fair share of opportunities as well.
“They’re really good at transition and they have some strong shooters, so we knew we had to take care of them, which our backs did really well,” Fleischman said.
Fleischman also gave props to the fans.
“[They] really helped the momentum in our favor, and we loved the support,” she said.
The team is looking forward to next Saturday’s game against Princeton.
“We know that we have to take every game one at a time and that every game is important,” Fleischman said.  “If we play our game, we’re playing to our strengths; it doesn’t matter who we are playing; we’ll come out on top.”
Johnson said that the team views every opponent in the same light.
“The mentality we have this year is not to really think about the Ivy League—it’s just one step at a time,” she said.  “Every week we prepare for the next game and we go into that weekend and as soon as that game’s over it’s just another game the next week so that’s really how we’ve been approaching it.”
This week, the team plans to stick to what they’ve got.
“[We’re going to] just keep focusing on us and doing what we do best,” Fleischman said.  “That’s all that really matters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team split its two weekend games at the Ivy League Championship in Philadelphia on its way to a third-place finish.
The Crimson was hoping to defeat division rival Brown for the third time this year after having gone winless the previous seven years. But the team was unable to translate its earlier success this Sunday, falling to the Bears (13-9, 7-5 CWPA Northern) in the first game of the tournament, 12-9.
 
No. 17 Harvard (11-9, 8-1 CWPA Northern) was able to bounce back later in the day, finishing strong in a consolation match against Penn (11-7, 9-0 CWPA Mid-Atlantic), 22-11.
 
“We were disappointed with our loss against Brown,” senior goalkeeper Jimmy Field said. “But we were able to rebound and overcome a strong Penn team.”
 
HARVARD 22, PENN 11
 
On Sunday afternoon, the Crimson offense started strong and never looked back, scoring 15 first-half goals on its way to victory against host Penn.
 
“We were able to start scoring early and keep the attack going,” Field said.
 
Harvard benefitted from a balanced attack, as 10 players tallied goals in the contest, including a team-high and career-high four from freshman Dan Stevens.
 
“We came out against Penn with something to prove,” Stevens said. “In that game, we came out much harder than we did against Brown.”
 
Sophomore Noah Harrison and junior John Holland-McCowan also added hat tricks of their own. With his four goals on the day, Harrison now has a team-leading 42 on the season. Freshman Joey Colton led the team with four assists against the Quakers.
 
Senior Will Roller and sophomore Robbie Fluegge led the defensive effort for the Crimson with five and four steals, respectively. The team utilized a three-man rotation in nets, as Field and sophomores Connor Denney and Colin Woolway combined for seven saves in the game.
 
“We had a few letdowns,” Field said. “But we’ll hopefully…work through them this week.”
 
 After defeating Penn in its own pool on Sunday, Harvard improved to 6-2 on the road this season.
 
BROWN 12, HARVARD 9
 
The Crimson was able to tally six goals in an offensive surge in the fourth period. But despite the late attack, Harvard was unable to come back and erase its early deficit, losing to the Bears by three goals.
 
Seven Crimson players scored in the game, but the spread-out attack was not enough to take down the Bears on Sunday. Sophomore Blake Lee paced the Harvard attack with two goals and three assists in the losing effort. The team-assist leader Colton added two goals in the contest as well.
 
The two teams came out of the gates even, alternating goals in the first eight minutes to end the period knotted at three scores apiece.
 
However, Brown took control of the second quarter, outscoring the Crimson, 3-1, in the frame to send Harvard into halftime with a two-goal deficit.
 
“We had some unfortunate turnovers and some shots that we just weren’t able to put away,” Field said. “And that let them get a little momentum.”
 
The Crimson was not able to regain any momentum after halftime, failing to score a goal in the third period as the team saw the gap widen to six goals.
 
“I thought we came out flat,” Stevens said. “Early on they dominated and by the time we were able to catch up it was too little, too late.”
 
Harvard decided to go with a goalkeeper rotation for the tournament opener as well. Goalkeepers Field and Woolway manned the net for the Crimson, recording a combined three saves.
 
The loss snapped a seven-game win streak for the squad, its only such streak of the season. The team had not lost in almost a month, dating all the way back to a two-goal defeat at Iona Sep. 21.
 
Harvard has now split its four games against Brown this season. Before the Crimson won its two straight games, Brown won the first matchup of the season, 9-8, in the Bruno Fall Classic.
 
“Being 2-2 against Brown has really fostered an intense rivalry with them,” Stevens said. “We know that every time we play [Brown] it will be a strong, physical, and ultimately very close game.”
 
The Crimson has not fared well in neutral site games this year, falling to a 2-7 record in these games on the season.
 
“They came out strong and we weren’t able to execute as well as we had hoped,” Field said. “We weren’t able to put it together.”

Last weekend, I woke up to some devastating news: numerous sources reported rumors that Prince Harry is either secretly engaged or will be engaged to Cressida Bonas within the next year. Tasked with a heavy day of studying for midterms ahead of me, I found myself brainstorming ways to break the couple up. My plan was always you, Prince Harry. So, Prince Harry, if you’re reading this, here are a few reasons that you should be marrying a Harvard girl (I’m not saying it has to be me, but it definitely could be...):
 
1. We live in Cambridge, Mass.Your brother, Prince William, is the Duke of Cambridge, and your adorable baby nephew is now the Prince of Cambridge. Keep it in the family—you too could marry a woman “of Cambridge”.
 
2. We’ve proven ourselves capable of handling stress.Is Cressida capable of spending upwards of ten hours on a p-set, being in an a capella group, doing community service, and still staying fit and beautiful? I don’t think so. We’ll embrace all our princess duties like the overachievers we are—and we’ll look good doing it.
 
3. We could help your Grandma with governmental issues.Using our knowledge from our Econ, Government, and Psych classes, we could improve the quality of life in Britain by 100%. We’ll even let you take some of the credit.
 
4. We’re just the kind of discipline you need.You’re a party boy—it’s okay, we’re used to that, and we're used to dealing with it. In no time you’ll abandon your hedonistic ways. We’ll sit you down in Lamont and make sure you finish your work on time.
 
5. We’re so much more fun to party with than your normal crew.Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night, we’re up to hitting the town. We’ll finish our princess duties by 5 p.m. so that we have the night free to spend with you. Our DAPA experience will come in handy when we’re taking care of you after a rough night, and you’ll never have to worry about our feet being sore in our high heels—we’re used to the long walks to the Quad. We’re so up for helping you finish that Scorpion Bowl.
You still have time, Prince Harry, you haven’t even hit 30 yet. Make a Harvard girl your princess—you won’t regret it.
