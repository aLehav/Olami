After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard Innovation Lab will open a space for start-up ventures of Harvard alumni at 114 Western Ave. in Allston, extending its scope beyond current Harvard affiliates.
The new space, named the Launch Lab, will hold ten to 12 alumni ventures, which must include at least one alumnus of a Harvard school.
Though, at 3,000 square feet, the the new space will be smaller than the i-lab, members of participating projects will have full access to resources and programming across the street at the i-lab itself, according to i-lab Director Jodi Goldstein.
“Since its launch, the i-lab has been a breathtaking success, and this is the perfect next step,” said Angela Q. Crispi , associate dean for administration at the Business School. 
The i-lab opened in Nov. 2011 as a cross-disciplinary center of entrepreneurship for the University. Goldstein said the concept for an i-lab for alumni emerged as students on the first venture teams began to graduate from their respective Harvard schools. Many began to work on their start-ups full time, but without access to the conference spaces, mentor programs, and events that the i-lab provided while they were students.
“Once they graduate, they need our support even more so than when they are students,” Goldstein said, adding that alumni working on projects should be able to stay and develop their entrepreneurial endeavors further.
I-lab administrators first brought the idea to its advisory board a year ago. The board, composed of Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and 11 deans from Harvard's various schools, approved an initial prototype that has been in development this year.
Crispi predicted that the space will house both teams with members who worked in the i-lab as Harvard students and alumni who are new to the i-lab, but are interested in taking advantage of the University’s resources to develop ideas.
The Launch Lab will differ from the i-lab in its focus on ventures that are further developed. Teams must have their own sources of funding to be accepted into the space and will pay rent, which the i-lab does not require of student ventures. The space’s online application opened this week. 
“In accepting teams, we are less focused on teaching and promoting early ventures and more about the potential of the idea,” Goldstein said.
At least one team leader is required to physically work in the space—an attempt  to enhance connections between alumni and current students working at the i-lab and promote Allston as a center for entrepreneurship.
“We hope that this is a step toward developing Allston as a hub of entrepreneurial activity in the Boston area,” Goldstein said, citing Kendall Square in Cambridge as a model.

CORRECTION: May 1, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of deans who serve on the i-lab's advisory board. In fact, 11 deans from across the University's various school serve on the board.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Several students stationed themselves in front of an entrance to Massachusetts Hall beginning at 6 a.m. Wednesday, blocking the main entrance to the offices of the University’s top administrators in an effort to secure an open meeting with the Harvard Corporation regarding fossil fuel divestment.
The maneuver kicked off the activist group Divest Harvard’s Day of Action, the latest effort in a two-year-old campaign calling for the University to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry.
According to a Divest Harvard press release, their campaign is one of over 400 similar pushes for divestment from the top 200 publicly traded oil, coal, and gas companies on campuses around the world.
University President Drew G. Faust, representatives of the Harvard Management Company, and other members of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—have met with members of Divest Harvard in the past but have maintained that the University will continue to invest in fossil fuel companies.
In an October 2013 letter to the Harvard community, Faust reaffirmed that stance, writing that the University’s role as an academic institution is to support research to accelerate the transition to renewable sources of energy. Earlier this month, she announced a number of sustainability initiatives to address the risks of climate change.
In a series of rallies and speeches throughout the day, faculty members, alumni, and Cambridge community leaders spoke to a crowd of dozens of students and passersby on the importance of divesting and student activism more broadly.
The morning rally featured Cambridge City Councillor Leland Cheung and environmental activist Bob Massie, among others, who expressed their support of the divestment movement.


At noon, writer Wen Stephenson ’90—one of more than 800 Harvard alumni who have signed an open letter to Faust calling for fossil fuel divestment—drew applause from the crowd when he said, “The climate crisis isn’t going away, and neither are we.”
Shoshana Zuboff—a retired Business School professor and the only signatory representative of the Business School from more than 180 Harvard faculty members who have signed a similar petition—similarly spoke of Harvard’s responsibility as a “respected institution of knowledge.”
“There has not been an open dialogue. President Faust has unilaterally stated certain positions without evidence-based reasoning,” Zuboff said. “This is a university, and what we stand for is debate based on evidence and full, solid reasoning. It has been set aside, it has been suppressed.”
As the day progressed into the afternoon, various student organizations came together for a conversation on justice and activism on campus. Representatives from Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement, Our Harvard Can Do Better, and the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, along with Tufts and Brandeis students were present during the conversation.
Students spent much of the conversation discussing activism methods and the use of “shaming techniques,” such as a filmed confrontation of Faust by a member of Divest Harvard and the recent SHAME tour conducted by Responsible Investment at Harvard, to push for change in the administration.
Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, a Crimson editorial editor, said that shaming is "really powerful in galvanizing support, but it didn't put pressure on the administration."
Many students said they believed that leveraging federal law and University funds by drawing on donor support is a more effective means to securing administrative support.
While members of Divest Harvard said they did not know whether Faust was in her office during the event, a University official confirmed that Faust was in Washington, D.C., at a meeting of the presidents of member institutions of the Association of American Universities.
“We recognize that members of our community have a variety of perspectives on how to respond most effectively to the serious dangers posed by climate change,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in a statement. “President Faust, other members of the Harvard Corporation, and representatives of Harvard Management Company have discussed these issues on many occasions, including multiple meetings with Divest Harvard.”
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde was the only member of the administration to address the blockade, according to Divest Harvard coordinator Chloe S. Maxmin ’15. Maxmin said that Lassonde spoke to the crowd in the morning and said that while the students had a right to protest, they may face disciplinary action since they were blocking a building entrance.
About four Harvard University Police Department officers stood at the outskirts of the rally to monitor the situation. Because the Divest Harvard students only blockaded one entrance to Massachusetts Hall and there were other ways into the building, an officer said the rally was not disruptive and the coalition was entitled to its free speech.
When asked how long the blockade would last, Maxmin said that Divest Harvard’s position is that “it is completely in the hands of the administration” and did not offer a specific timeframe in mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 2, 2014, at 9:52 p.m.
Brett A. Roche ’15, a member of the environmental activist group Divest Harvard, was arrested by Harvard University Police around 7:15 a.m. Thursday morning for blocking an entrance to Massachusetts Hall, home to the offices of University President Drew G. Faust and members of the central administration.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in a statement early Thursday afternoon that HUPD and the University decided not to press charges against Roche and that he was released from custody earlier in the day.
Roche had been guarding the door throughout the night as part of Divest Harvard’s Day of Action to demand an open meeting with the Harvard Corporation on the issue of divestment.
Before 6 a.m., eight students rotated shifts so that at least two were present for the blockade at all times. At 6 a.m., more supporters arrived, including environmental activist Bob Massie and Harvard’s Quaker Chaplain John Bach, to physically take part in the protest.
Unlike on Wednesday, when the student protesters blockaded only the main entrance to the building and police said they did not consider the protesters disruptive because other entrances to the building remained accessible, they began blocking all three entrances to Massachusetts Hall starting at 6 a.m. on Thursday morning.
According to Divest Harvard member Benjamin Franta, a graduate student in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Faust’s senior special assistant, Lars P.K. Madsen, was hindered from entering the building when he arrived for work around 7 a.m.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano confirmed that an employee attempted to gain entry using different entrances to Massachusetts Hall, and when the officers requested Roche to move, he was instructed that a failure to comply would result in his arrest.
“The individual again refused to move and held onto the door handle of the building to deny access to the building,” Catalano wrote. “The individual was subsequently placed under arrest.”
 
Roche said that his arrest and interactions with the police were “very civil.” He added that he would have appreciated if Madsen had directly approached him rather than “sending HUPD to tell me to move.”
“The fact that I wasn’t even spoken to at the door, that microscopic example of [the administration] avoiding interaction with the students, upset me a bit,” Roche said. “What we’re trying to do out there was show the administration that this is something that should be expected of them. They should be expected to listen to and engage with their students.”
According to Roche, after being taken to HUPD headquarters and processed, he arrived at a courthouse in Medford, Mass. around 10 a.m., was put in a holding cell, and met with a judge in trial who dismissed the case.
The remaining protesters continued the blockade for about an hour before disbanding. Franta said that the University police controlled the Massachusetts Hall door after the arrest, so individuals were then able to enter and exit freely.
“We were disappointed that the University would rather arrest one of its own students than have a open dialogue on divestment,” Franta said.
Galvin, for his part, wrote that the University “welcomes the exchange of ideas and respects the rights of individuals to air differing views. At the same time, we put a premium on respecting the rights of individuals to carry out their duties to the institution.”

Back in 1989, Jeremy A. Kahn '90-'91 started a new club for nerds. It was called the Society of Nerds and Geeks (SONG), and it was aca-awesome.
According to a Crimson article, the club’s founder said "we must encourage the outside world to take more notice of nerds and geeks and to recognize our value." Today, said founder attends Comic Con every year and sheds a single tear over how far society has progressed. (Don’t be on the wrong side of history: buy your ticket to Comic Con today!)
Nineteen students attended the club’s introductory meeting, four of whom had never been to a gathering that large before. The enthusiasm at the meeting was palpable. "I came because I didn't have a problem set to do tonight, and I couldn't think of anything better to do," said Cabot House resident Allon G. Percus '92. This was in the days before laptop computers and internet porn.
Among its various goals, the club planned to have studyathon parties in which “BYOB” would stand for “Bring Your Own Books.” Don’t worry—the signs saying that you had to be 21+ to read were just for show.
The club’s legacy is unclear, but there’s reason to believe it exists today and is known as Sigma Chi.

From the House that brought us, objectively, this year’s best housing day video and a mildly-disturbing, annual celebration of house spirit called IncestFest, Kirkland House has outdone itself, yet again, in promoting its revered image by bringing a whole new meaning to the term incest.
For the Kirkland House formal, held later today at the Boston Aquarium, Katherine Buellesbach ‘16 and Sophia Randolph ‘16 created K-Harmony, a Kirkland spin-off of Datamatch, a survey that will give shy, incestuous Kirklanders the ability to find a date in-house.
Many questions are raised by K-Harmony. In our ruthless pursuit of the truth, Flyby posed the following questions to Kate and Sophia, each the other’s second choice in their K-Harmony matches.
Flyby: Why did you create K-Harmony?Kate: I think that anything that helps House spirit is always welcome. And, anything that encourages people to meet new people in the House, we would really want to encourage that.
Flyby: How many marriages do you expect to come out of this?Sophia: In the preliminary run of this, Kate and I were each other’s number two matches, so there’s the potential for at least one marriage.Kate: Yeah, I think so. I am going to conservatively say 50%.Sophia: I would like to shout out that the results are gender neutral and that this whole thing is geared at making best friends, soul mates, future roommates, life partners, co-pet owners.
Flyby: Do you feel that this service for Kirkland House discriminates against people in Eliot and Winthrop, houses that are in Kirkland’s sphere?Sophia: We are encouraging people to attend formal who don’t live in Kirkland to even fill it out. But, a couple of the questions, admittedly, do poke a little fun at our neighbors.
Flyby: Kirkland has an incestuous reputation already; does K-Harmony further that reputation?Kate: Well, we do all live with each other.
TAKEAWAYS
1. Incest is a way of life in Kirkland House:
All residents of Kirkland want is to eat meals with each other, go to formal with each other, and get married to each other. Disgusting.
2. Kirklanders are elitist:
Members of Eliot and Winthrop are encouraged to take a quiz that makes fun of their houses. Fascism.
