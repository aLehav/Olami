It’s not hard to divine how Marcel Theroux must have thought up the basic seed for “Strange Bodies.” While staring out some bus window, or waiting for sleep to come, or in the shower, he happened upon the idea: “What if you could recreate a consciousness from someone’s writing?” As an author, of course, he latched onto this inspiration around which he constructed a world and a cast of characters, a Russian conspiracy and a 19th-century intellectual. The novel that results is well-written and undeniably engaging; as it progresses, however, Theroux makes obvious that the various story elements he has constructed around his fundamental idea are built on a shaky foundation. Ultimately, the book’s plot and motivation are so gravely half-baked that, were Theroux not a relatively capable wordsmith, “Strange Bodies” would most rightfully belong  among a bookstore’s mystery novels. Excise all that is science fiction from “Strange Bodies” and it might become a somewhat respectable, albeit boring, book; as is, it succeeds only on the small scale of sentences and largely fails as a cohesive work.
One of Theroux’s gravest errors, perhaps made as an attempt to bolster an unlikely plot, is the bizarre structural choices he makes throughout the novel. Its core narrator, Nicholas, is a compelling and well-spoken character, an English scholar whose education is evident in his artful manner of expression. His narration is completely sufficient; the novel could easily function on his words alone. Theroux, unfortunately, is not satisfied with Nicholas—at certain awkwardly sparse points during the novel, he injects an email conversation or an excerpt from a therapist’s diary that adds absolutely nothing to the story or style of the book, particularly as every other character is a far poorer writer than Nicholas. This occurs most catastrophically in the novel’s preface, which is told by Nicholas’s ex-girlfriend, an entirely inept writer. The entire section reads like a teenager’s diary—for example, she quotes Nicholas as melodramatically saying, “‘The Nicky she knew is dead,’” in response to a question about his wife, something the literary-minded Nicholas would never say. Clearly, Theroux is trying to create contrast between her writing style and that of Nicholas, as Theroux himself is a far better writer than the ex-girlfriend character. But by commencing the novel in this woman’s style, what he does instead is ensure that anyone who has never read his work before will wonder until he or she finishes the preface how “Strange Bodies” possibly got published.
  After this point, however, “Strange Bodies” hits its stride—its first half is subject to no grave errors of plot or style and is based far more in literature than in the poorly devised pseudoscience that constitutes the novel’s most conspicuous failing. Chief among this portion’s achievements is the character of Johnson, an imagined 19th-century writer whose works and speech are convincingly constructed. Most importantly, Johnson and Nicholas’s passion for his works provide an emotional grounding for the story that is only enhanced when Nicholas discovers his recreated form. Johnson’s transformation from “monument” into “living man who smelled of sweat and woodsmoke, feared death, hunger, and madness,” almost provides sufficient rationale for the novel’s bizarre scientific backdrop.
 This sense is cheapened when Nicholas refers to the process of rebuilding a consciousness from that person’s writing as “the Procedure,” an unnecessary moniker more appropriate to a terrible horror movie. As the “scientific” takes an increasingly important role in the story, it progressively loses its compelling nature and its claim to literary status. Not only is this so-called “Procedure” completely unbelievable, but it also seems Theroux has put no effort into making it so. The various bits of explication one encounters throughout the novel are unconvincing and insubstantial; they do very little to further the basic idea of using computer algorithms to convert a person’s writings into his or her consciousness. It seems at times that the scientific theory and geopolitical tension crafted around this “Procedure” exist only to make Johnson’s story possible, because they are so flat and uninteresting by themselves.
  So what could be compelling—and is compelling, for the first half of “Strange Bodies”—is ultimately rendered boring and even silly because Theroux does so little to defend the elements of science fiction that form the basis of his work. One sees a glimmer of what the “Procedure” might have become when Nicholas and his own reconstructed consciousness, which has been inserted into another body, interact for a short time and thus explore the philosophical implications of artificially generated consciousness. But this relatively brief period of interaction, as well as the novel’s relatively successful initial portion, do little to redeem a fundamentally flawed premise. Theroux is a decently skilled writer and certainly has the capability to craft a successful book—that is, if he does not get caught up in his bizarre flights of fancy and avoids an excessively ambitious scope. On its own and with extraneous injections from other narrators removed, the first half of “Strange Bodies” would be a decent novel, albeit with an unresolved storyline. But such mystery would nevertheless be an improvement on the messy, half-baked storyline that Theroux has crafted.

Isabel Allende grew up in chaos. She was raised in an unhappy, dysfunctional household in Santiago, Chile, and was forced to flee her country as a political refugee during the coup d’état of 1973 after the assassination of her cousin Salvador Allende, the former president of Chile.
  With all the turmoil she’s lived through, it’s a wonder how brilliant and consistent her work output has become. She starts writing every year on January 8 and has produced nearly a novel a year since 1998. Her latest, “Ripper,” is her first foray into crime fiction and tells the story of a teen sleuth in San Francisco trying to track down her mother’s killer. Allende gave a book talk at the Harvard Book Store this past Tuesday and also spoke with The Crimson by phone.
 
The Harvard Crimson: How did exile shape you as a writer?
Isabel Allende: Not just as a writer—it changed my life. I had to leave my country and live in Venezuela for 13 years. I think writing “The House of the Spirits” [her first novel] was a crazy attempt to recover everything I had lost—my house, my family, my country. I was beginning to lose my memories of the past. So writing the novel helped me recover all that. I don’t think I would be a writer if I had stayed in Chile.
 
THC: Why did you decide to write a crime novel? 
IA: It wasn’t my idea. I had announced to my agent in 2011 that I was planning to retire. She panicked and told me to write a book with my husband, who’s a crime novel writer. But our styles and habits are very different, and we had been fighting like dogs. So on January 8, he went to his room to work on his sixth crime novel, and I went to my room to start my first.
 
THC: I hope you’re not actually retiring after this!
IA: No, I don’t think so, because I realize that people only like me when I am locked away writing.
 
THC: How did you approach the project?
IA: I don’t know anything about the genre, really—just what I have been hearing from [my husband] all these years. I couldn’t possibly take it seriously. In Spanish, the book is called El Juego de Ripper [The Ripper Game]. So that’s how I wrote it—The Game of Writing the Ripper Game. I was playing, like the kids in the novel are playing detective: they have imagination, intuitions, and they love the process.
 
THC: What were the challenges of writing within the genre?
IA: For a crime novel, I’ve been told, the author has to have a very neat plan and be very logical, and start from the end of the story. My mind doesn’t work that way. I never have a plan: I sit down on January 8 and just open a vein. Day by day, the story somehow unfolds, the characters appear, and become people. I live their lives. The story started to happen, and then I had to go back and plant the clues and write in the characters I needed. It’s not a very logical way to write the story.  But it’s the only way I can do it.
 
THC: You’re acclaimed for carrying on the magical realist tradition of Borges and García Márquez. Are there elements of so-called magical realism in this novel? 
IA: The mother in the novel is a healer: she does crystals, meditation, aromatherapy. Whenever things like that happen in Latin America, it’s called magical realism. If they happen in California, it’s holistic medicine, or whatever. I think that magical realism has become a label for everything Latin American, but you find the same stuff everywhere.
 
THC: Can you tell me about your infamous encounter with Chilean poet Pablo Neruda?
IA: Neruda called the place I was working, a magazine, and said he wanted me to visit him. I thought, “If the Nobel Prize winner calls me, I must be the best journalist in the country!” So I bought a new tape recorder and drove all the way to the beach. It was windy and rainy and gross. We had lunch, and then I asked to interview him. He said, “I will never be interviewed by you. You are the worst journalist in the country! You lie all the time, you make things up, you are never objective. Why don’t you switch to literature, where all of your defects become virtues?”
I didn’t pay any attention then: that was ’73 and I wrote my first novel in ’81. But I realized that he was right. I was a lousy journalist.
 
THC: Do you have any advice for college writers?
IA: Write a bad novel. If you try to sit down and write the great American novel, you will never get anything done. Like sports, writing needs discipline and work, but also joy and playfulness. You need to love the craft and the process.

Well-hidden within Kyle Minor’s “Praying Drunk,” a book that lies somewhere between story collection and novel, are five pages completely covered in matte black ink, margin-to-margin, front and back. These pages are not a gimmick; Minor’s writing stands on its own. Finishing one of the many painful stories in “Praying Drunk” to discover a full black page only enhances its overall effect. In 13 tales, Minor creates a cast of characters who are distinct yet echo one another across the stories and struggle to make sense of relentless tragedy. Minor’s narratives brim with energy and talent—he creates beautiful scenes of personal pain while asking broad, thematic questions. Through the various stories of “Praying Drunk,” Minor exhibits his full literary toolbox, honed to execute his emotional storytelling.
 
At the beginning of “Praying Drunk” is a small but stern admonition: “These stories are meant to be read in order. This is a book, not just a collection. DON’T SKIP AROUND.” It’s odd and even funny to be admonished by the author before doing much of anything, but it is worth paying attention to the warning. Minor carefully crafts the stories to play off of one another. Conflicts, settings, and even names reappear throughout the book, all slightly distorted. He creates a type of mythos that unites the book’s technically distinct stories and develops the theme of incomprehensible and unforgettable pain. The author appears in fictionalized form as “the fiery angel” in two stories presented as Q&A sessions. The angel provides explanation for the book’s internal repetitions when he says, “Only the same things turned over again and again, as though turning them again will bring some new insight. But the new insights are the same as the old insights. Heaven is a hamster wheel. Why won’t my heart stop beating?” It’s a dark clarification of Minor’s technique of getting at every story twice. Yet his approach is so original and different that the stories still seem distinct—they feel more like reverberations than repetitions.
 
The fiery angel is just one example of how unusual “Praying Drunk” can be. In various stories, Minor uses tragedy to create an element of irony that in some ways relieves the book’s unremitting sadness. In “The Truth and All Its Ugly,” Minor crafts the tale of an abusive husband and his battered wife. The man describes his wife finally leaving him when “[s]he said it enough that we stopped believing her, but the last time she said it, she did it.” In another story, Minor creates an additional fictionalized version of himself, a former preacher who becomes a writer after a loss of faith—an element of real biography. The character reflects, “God doesn’t probably answer our prayers,” an atypical phrasing that creates ironic humor from a particularly dark place.
 
The greatest strength of “Praying Drunk” is its emotional core of sincere desperation. Minor’s characters are deeply flawed—they are petty, small, and selfish. One is more concerned with himself than with his dying grandfather. Another beats his wife and snorts drugs with his 17-year-old son. Minor’s most impressive achievement is resolving their repulsive, often grotesque natures with the reader’s sense of sympathy. He does this by standing them up against circumstances that are extraordinary yet common—losses of trust, faith, and life. It is difficult not to sympathize with these sometimes hideous monsters because their pain and sadness are so authentic. “Praying Drunk” is nothing if not an intensely affecting book. However, this kind of pathos comes at the cost of occasionally devious writing. For instance, the story “The Truth and All Its Ugly” hinges on a peculiar detail—that, in this world, humans can be recreated—that appears toward its beginning but remains unexplored until it is leveraged for maximum effect at the end of the story. The collection’s first story, “The Question of Where We Begin,” examines the act of storytelling in a way that is painfully trope-y in its self-reflexivity. Minor asks one rhetorical question after another in what appears to be an attempt to attribute a definite cause to the death of an uncle. But it’s obvious that he is just exemplifying the arbitrary nature of storytelling, and so the story falls flat.
 
Despite its shortcomings, “Praying Drunk” is fresh and energetic. Minor breaks out a wide range of skills for this book and plays extensively with form and narrative. The collection is tied together by difficult-to-place but clearly present repetitions of previously explored characters and ideas. It’s not perfect; it can feel clumsy, artificial, and a bit scattered at times. It is a book that primarily asks questions—the writer seems just as lost as his characters. But it’s also darkly funny, fiercely energetic, and unapologetically sincere.

When George C. Ko ’15 joined the Harvard College Piano Society three years ago, he was one of only six pianists in the group. Now, as Ko takes a year off to study piano in California, the sextet has grown to a society of 50 dedicated members. Not only has the Harvard College Piano Society expanded its membership tremendously but its recitals have also evolved from casual, social affairs to performances on a larger scale. This year, the society has taken its music outside the red bricks of Harvard in collaboration with other colleges, bringing student artistic communities together through the creation of music. 
  The Harvard College Piano Society recently partnered with student performers at Boston University to produce “The Two Piano Project,” which took place in BU’s Tsai Auditorium last Thursday. The program consisted solely of works composed for two pianos, including pieces by Debussy, Milhaud, and Rachmaninoff, performed on separate pianos by one Harvard and one BU student. “The schools are so close to each other, and we felt that there is a need in Boston to have more collaborative music-making,” says Ko, whose piano teacher in Boston, Boaz Sharon, is the head of BU’s Piano Department. “We wanted to revive the spirit of collaboration through music beyond our own halls.” The two piano societies plan to alternate the location of their annual performances between Harvard and BU, meaning that next year’s show will take place at Harvard.
  Later this month, the Harvard College Piano Society is expanding further down the East Coast, collaborating with the Princeton Pianists Ensemble to put on “Piano Battle! Harvard vs. Princeton!” The large-scale show, which will see 40 pianists—20 from Harvard and 20 from Princeton—perform on up to five pianos at a time, will take place on February 15 in Princeton’s Richardson Auditorium. The show will feature arrangements of works by Bach and Holst, as well as two original pieces composed by members of Harvard and Princeton’s delegations for the other school, Harvard’s entry being Sam Wu ’17’s “Dancing Shadows in an Ice Cave.” The concert will close with a duo of partially improvised “piano battles” on two of the schools’ fight songs, “Ten Thousand Men” and “Old Nassau.” 
  Harvard College Piano Society member Cherie Z. Hu ’17, who is performing J.S. Bach’s “Concerto for Four Keyboards” along with another member of the Harvard College Piano Society and two Princeton pianists, admitted to being a little nervous about playing in such a large performance with pianists she has yet to meet. “We’re planning to get there Saturday morning and spend all afternoon rehearsing a lot, hoping it’ll come together,” says Hu. “Playing with another pianist definitely involves knowing the other person’s style and musical personality.” 
  While “Piano Battle! Harvard vs. Princeton” will not crown an official winner or loser, the event itself is a stepping stone toward accomplishing the Harvard College Piano Society’s founding goal of bridging the gaps between musical communities and building an integrated community of artists.

For Eric Berglund, also known as CEO, vagueness is a virtue. The former Tough Alliance member writes lyrics that resemble poorly translated Imagist poems and picks samples seemingly at random: the one that starts his second solo release, “Wonderland,” is a quote from an Icelandic documentary about a falconer’s misguided search for Osama bin Laden. And in a written statement announcing “Wonderland,” Berglund closed with a puzzling, Big Ghostian send-off: “ceo is you and you are me and I am ceo aka white panther aka ultra messiah aka mr yeah aka eric aka life aka you.”
 
In the painfully obvious universe of electro-pop, however, the enigma of CEO is a welcome diversion. On “Wonderland,” Berglund cares less about meeting expectations than he does about eliminating them altogether. Like Lewis Carroll’s creation of the same name, the resulting landscape is simultaneously opulent and unsettling, both organic and artificial.
 
As on his previous release under the (then-uncapitalized) CEO moniker, 2010’s “White Magic,” Berglund makes heavy use of understated synth loops, inscrutable voice samples, and cluttered drum tracks on “Wonderland.” These elements come together superbly on the two immediately catchiest tracks on the album, the opening “Whorehouse” and the closing “OMG.” However, Berglund has considerably expanded his musical arsenal in the past four years. The crisp, tubular hook that runs throughout “Mirage” could have been pulled straight from a Lex Luger beat; the whirring, Rube Goldberg-esque rhythms of “Ultrakaos,” from Shugo Tokumaru or Battles. It’s the way in which Berglund manipulates and juxtaposes these disparate elements that elevates “Wonderland” above “White Magic.”
 
Some of Berglund’s miniature experiments on “Wonderland” don’t work—especially the floundering instrumentals “Juju” and “In A Bubble On A Stream,” which sound eerily like excerpts from a low-rent anime score. But most of them do, spectacularly. The opening of “OMG” interweaves grating vocal samples, a women’s chorus, and a syncopated harp loop[,] to spectacular effect. The combination is maddeningly fleeting, only persisting for about twenty seconds before breaking off. Nothing lasts on “Wonderland,” for better or for worse.
 
For all of its opulence, “Wonderland” feels, at its heart, strangely and profoundly sad. It might be the contrast between Berglund’s simplistic, childlike melodies and his industrial-scale backing tracks that does the trick, recalling the lavish alienation of modern classics like “Kaputt” and “Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?” Also unsettling are the random, disembodied voices that mutter throughout the album, lending the tracks a weird, schizophrenic vibe. Finally, Berglund’s dark subject matter certainly plays a role—the first two tracks are titled “Whorehouse” and “Harakiri,” after all.  Whatever the reason, the melancholy feel of “Wonderland” marks a noticeable shift from Berglund’s earlier, emotionally detached work in The Tough Alliance and on “White Magic.”
 
Back in December, CEO released a wonderful cover of Kanye West’s “Hold My Liquor.” Berglund’s choice of song, it turns out, was a kind of clue to the nature of “Wonderland.” All the phrases that describe “Hold My Liquor” in the context of “Yeezus”—achingly ornate, rapidly shifting, and thoroughly unsettling—also describe “Wonderland” in the context of Berglund’s career. There should be many more great CEO records to come, but for now, “Wonderland” is a rabbit-hole truly worth diving into.

“Alban Berg asserted that new music should be performed as if it were old, and old as if it were new,” read the first line of Robert Levin’s brief note to the audience at his farewell concert, which took place this past Sunday afternoon in Sanders Theatre. The retiring Harvard professor has been known throughout his career for making music from the Classical period fresh and relevant. However, Sunday’s recital consisted instead of a program filled with pieces composed for Levin by four living composers: Yehudi Wyner, John Harbison, Hans Peter Türk (a world premiere), and Bernard Rands, plus an encore consisting of a piece by Levin’s “next-door neighbor” Thomas Oboe Lee.
 
It’s not every day that a matinee concert populated by a mostly white-haired audience and consisting entirely of music written in the past 23 years ends in a standing ovation. The audience’s reaction was only in part in appreciation of his performance—it also showed the listeners’ dedication to being challenged by an artist they trust.
 
Each piece elicited timid yet appreciative applause at its conclusion, with the Harbison getting a few whistles by virtue of its technical complexity and local origins (Harbison is a Harvard grad and teaches at MIT). Levin’s performances, all formidable, did not always provide these recent compositions with the vivacity that they always bring to music written three centuries ago. But this may not have always been his fault. The slower and more inward sections, especially much of the “Aria” in Harbison’s “Piano Sonata No. 2” and the early passages of Türk’s “Träume,” were sometimes vague and not very compelling. However, the virtuosic moments in Harbison’s “Ricercar,”  as well as the bumblebee-esque middle sections of “Träume,” came off very effectively. Levin avoided an overly clear and dry sound, instead choosing to pedal the passages with many rapid notes. The result was a bellowing wave of sound punctuated by clear, ringing intermediate tones.
 
Rands’ 12 Preludes, in which each movement consisted of a canonical musical form beginning with a letter from Levin’s name (“Ricercare,” “Ostinato,” “Bordone,” etc.) was last on the program. Levin gave each of the twelve movements its own color on the piano and its own pace in unfolding. Before Levin had set his hands down after the collection’s closing “Notturno,” the audience jumped in to show its approval of the nuanced performance.
 
However, they stood and cheered far more at Levin’s curtain call, after which he greeted them with a bit of advice, speaking about the importance of the unions between composers and performers. Levin called on performers to “choose a composer and play him” like a “horse at the racetrack” and see where they go: “Perhaps he will become a member of the pantheon of classical music, perhaps not,” Levin said. “When John Harbison and I were classmates at Harvard, he was one of those horses I bet on.”
 Levin’s farewell concert represented a look forward, an emblem of what he thinks performers in a long musical tradition should consider relevant and important. The concert was a way of calling on current and future Harvard classical music students, whom he will no longer have the opportunity to teach and who were not the majority of the audience, to remember that new music is still being written and that the creation of new music is a constant process. Levin’s programing choices were unexpected and unusual for a farewell concert. However, his decision shows the respect he has for his audience and the freedom they have, in turn, awarded him.

There doesn’t seem to be much after the disco—that’s the message that Broken Bells’ newest LP seems to suggest. Tepid as that statement may sound, it isn’t a total condemnation. The two-piece side project of vocalist James Mercer (The Shins) and prolific producer-instrumentalist Brian Burton (Danger Mouse, Gnarls Barkley, etc.) have found their niche. The problem is, after finding it on their indie-pop eponymous debut, “After the Disco” largely sees them unwilling to budge.
 
There are a few deviations. The first single, “Holding on For Life,” is an exciting and surprising collision of Bee Gees falsettos and atmospheric synth-heavy production. However, save for a few other standout tracks near the album’s beginning, it’s an outlier. For the rest of the playlist, the duo largely relies on the recipe that made “Broken Bells” such an earworm. Danger Mouse beams in his extraterrestrial psychedelic beats, and Mercer supplies the melodious vocals and catchy hooks. The result isn’t interesting per se, but it’s because of this formulaic approach that fans of the band’s first album will likely be content with their newest offering. Disappointment arises only when the nature of the band is considered. It’s supposed to be a side project. That idea in itself promises innovation, variability, and a freedom to push the sonic envelope in a direction that no one wants The Shins to go. Yet, instead of flying, “After the Disco” just hovers, and the listener can’t help but feel underwhelmed.
 
Much of “After the Disco” feels like a continuation of their debut. The few tracks that do stand out shine brightly but are concentrated towards the beginning of the album. Like “Holding on for Life,” the titular “After the Disco” is another track that invokes the Gibb brothers, not only in Mercer’s impressive falsetto, but also in grooviness. It’s both a tease and a reminder of the sublime territory of psychedelic groove and refracted light that the album could have inherited. Another point of interest is “Leave It Alone,” a slow burner that forsakes the disco ball, instead employing bluesy synths and soulful, distortion-licked backing vocals. With the majority of the captivating and immediately catchy songs clustered near the top of the playlist, however, a temptation exists to ditch the album’s later songs for its shinier beginning.
 
It takes a couple listens for that temptation to subside, but when it does, the rest of the album opens up considerably. Such is the case with “Lazy Wonderland,” a song that sounds exactly as its title suggests. Though it’s easily forgotten when considered in the glimmering shadow of the album’s disco openers, it’s the perfect accompaniment to a lethargic weekday evening. Another lost high point is the second single, “Medicine.” The track is catchy and fun but could have been lifted from the band’s eponymous debut. There does exist a middle ground between the band’s old and new disco-flavored highlights. That ground is inhabited by “The Changing Lights,” with its funky downtempo baseline and spacious hook that explodes into a multicolored musical mushroom cloud.
 
“After the Disco” also fails to inspire lyrically. Devoid of imagery or inventiveness, Mercer’s lines often feel uninspired and occasionally cliché. The first lines of the album’s opener, “A Perfect World,” epitomize his unimaginative tendency to tell rather than show. He croons, “I’ve got nothing left, it’s kind of wonderful / cause there’s nothing they can take away.” Similar is the album’s closer, “The Remains of Rock and Roll,” where he declares, “I’m off to the promised land if anyone needs a ride / it’s a small car but we’ll fit inside if we leave our bags behind.”  Mercer’s lyrics express what he wants them to, but they’re hardly noteworthy and never groundbreaking.
 
“After the Disco” is an album dip-dyed in disco. Its tips, roughly the first three tracks of its playlists, are saturated with the deep purple and blue hues of dreamy, psychedelic funk. However, as the album progresses, the catchy and moody pop of the band’s debut becomes more and more apparent. The result is an album that quickly previews innovation and dynamism only to retreat back to the safety of its original formula. It isn’t completely lackluster by any means, but despite Burton’s sublime production and Mercer’s on-point vocals, it doesn’t feel as good as it could have been. Whether that is attributed to laziness or trepidation, listeners can only hope that Broken Bells’ next effort will coax the duo out of its comfort zone.

Last Thursday, Jan. 30, in Sanders Theatre, 18 politely dressed, middle-aged or middle-aged-plus lecture-goers held up crimson placards to declare in no uncertain terms, “HARVARD LOVES WYNTON.” At the conclusion of the lecture three hours later, the declaration returned: “HARVARD OVES WYNTON,” the signs read, until a weary, jazz-saturated attendee located the missing letter and restored it to its rightful place.
Like past Marsalis lectures, there was a lot to take in: the relevant pre-American history of Louisiana, technical differences between the performance practices of contemporaneous New Orleans bands, and so forth. While I was listening, I couldn’t help but think that these lectures were meticulously designed to be a hit at Harvard: jam-packed with facts and anecdotes; sprinkled with jokes and clever, if at times corny, turns of phrase; interdisciplinary, using musical performance and analysis to teach American cultural history; and allegorizing jazz to prove its place as fundamental to America itself. 
As a student of jazz, however, I can’t help but feel deeply ambivalent seeing Marsalis at Harvard. At times, this feeling is spurred by the fact that so many fellow lecture-goers don’t share any such ambivalence or skepticism. As I have seen, “HARVARD LOVES WYNTON.”
My first exposure to Marsalis was through Ken Burns’ 10-part, 1140-minute documentary series “Jazz” (2001), which my parents, longtime NPR devotees, gave to me for Christmas in middle school when I first became serious about learning this music. Watching Marsalis talk in the documentary, I remember being impressed in particular by his enthusiasm for Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and the other greats in his account of jazz history.
This was long before I was warned by older musicians about how “Jazz” omitted the contributions of many innovative, significant musicians; before I read other prominent musicians’ criticisms of Marsalis’ playing (e.g., pianist Keith Jarrett: “Wynton has no voice and no presence,” or trombonist and composer Bob Brookmeyer: “If Wynton died tomorrow he wouldn’t leave us one note on paper or on record that’s worth anything”); and before I had heard the claim that Marsalis, as head of Jazz at Lincoln Center, was actively freezing jazz into a museum music by advocating and preserving older sensibilities about jazz playing at the cost of newer, more exploratory approaches.
  For a couple years, I avoided all things bearing Marsalis’ name like the plague. I wanted to be part of the solution, not the problem. But it wasn’t until my senior of high school, when I heard him play—really play, with the fire of a young man with much to prove—on “Standard Time, Vol. 1” (1987), that I realized my mistake: I’d spent far more time consuming received wisdom about the musician than forming my own opinion about him.
Unlike older musicians I’ve spoken to, most of my peers have a relatively moderate, consciously distant opinion of Marsalis, something along the lines of, “He’s a killing trumpet player, absolutely, but I don’t agree with all his views on music.” Among my trumpet-playing friends, he’s certainly not the most influential in stylistic terms (“Now, the genius is the one everyone is imitating,” Marsalis said during his lecture)—far younger trumpeters like Ambrose Akinmusire would be contenders for most evidently influential. But Marsalis, I think, has been one of the most influential musicians for me.
Although I haven’t learned any of his solos or tried to emulate his compositional approach, because of Marsalis I’ve learned that there is no disinterested criticism—that works of art often can and should be understood in ideological terms, either as part of an argument or belief buried beneath the surface—and that we as jazz musicians have a responsibility to formulate our own understanding of this music’s history and not take others’ historical narratives for granted.
  At first, I balked when I had heard that Marsalis was to present six lectures at Harvard about jazz and its history. He seemed a safe choice, the one most likely to please the broadest audience. I realize now that I was wrong: Wynton Marsalis, because of the political and musical baggage that he carries, was actually one of the most controversial choices. He made and still makes the jazz community argue, often divisively and heatedly, about authenticity, tradition, and the future of the music. I have no problem with Harvard loving Wynton, but I’d just like Harvard to consider why they love him, and whether there’s more to the story than is apparent after a first listen.
 
Postscript: For the uninitiated who haven’t read about the time Miles Davis told Marsalis to “get the fuck off” the stage at a major jazz festival, or heard about how some critics claim that Wynton was destroying jazz and its future in the ’90s and ’00s, or seen a young, arrogant Marsalis dissing abstract painting and modern classical music, I strongly recommend the following as a primer to the controversial side of Wynton Marsalis:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It is impossible to play music at Harvard without being impacted in one way or another by Robert D. Levin ’68, the Dwight P. Robinson Jr. professor of music. Throughout his career, Levin has approached classical music from all its angles. He is a professor, classical performer, musicologist, and composer, as well as the artistic director of the Sarasota Music Festival. After earning his A.B. in music at Harvard, he was named head of the Theory Department at the Curtis Institute of Music. He later served as professor of piano at the Staatliche Hochschule für Musik in Freiburg, Germany. In 1993, he returned to Harvard as a professor of music and was a head tutor from 1998 to 2004. He is renowned for his restoration of the Classical period practice of improvised embellishments and cadenzas.
 
After almost two decades of teaching at Harvard, Levin is retiring from his alma mater this year. To celebrate his retirement, the Music Department has created a prize in his name that rewards outstanding musicianship for a graduating student each year. On Jan. 26, Levin also gave a solo recital at Sanders Theatre to cap off his career at Harvard.
 
The Harvard Crimson:  How does Harvard’s music program compare to that of a music conservatory? How was your experience different?
 
Robert D. Levin: It would have never occurred to me that I would’ve attended here. My teacher, Nadia Boulanger, was responsible for me coming here. I thought I would attend Juilliard, but she told me, “No, you are going to get a liberal arts education; you are going to Harvard.” She understood the virtues of a far-flung, broadening, critical acumen-producing liberal arts education. Here, I took courses in history and literature, French literature and philosophy. Harvard isn’t like a sweatshop conservatory. Rather, there is a broadening awareness of culture. The undergraduates and graduates here play their instruments very well; they are very intelligent and thoughtful. They approach the drama of music making with a broader view, as well as being experts at the technical aspects of music.
 
THC: What are some things you did here at Harvard? 
 
RDL: During my tenure at Harvard, I made a big deal about supporting student composers. I initiated the undergraduate senior thesis concert for music concentrators. When I was the head tutor, I would ask the senior composers, “Are you going to perform your pieces? Why not?” I told the department that [the concert] was something that needed to be done. It was a coming-of-age as a musician. Some colleagues disagreed, saying that it was going to be hard for students to get their music played in the real world. But I felt that it was important to raise the importance of the survival of our art, which is conditioned by the process of renewal. You keep the connection alive—you have to find some music that’s being written now. In supporting the musicians you believe [in], you are keeping the culture.
 
THC: Speaking of modernity, you are an expert on music from the Classical period, but music written then wasn’t for the modern piano. How do you address this issue?
 
RDL: We have no way of knowing if they would have preferred the modern piano. But one thing is certain—to the extent that when fashion designers fit their clothes for the runway show exactly to the model, these composers wrote music for specific instruments. The composer is tailoring his music to the instrument. And as a musician now, you need to have experienced how that specific instrument sounds. Then you can come back to the modern piano and transpose. It’s not going to be exactly the same. It’s been a voyage of discovery to immerse myself in these various textures and sounds that come out of these instruments. I investigate how I can reproduce the sounds—is it something that I can make...happen by altering the technique? Some people insist on overriding certain textures to reveal their individuality, but I want to put myself into service for music.
 
THC: What are your plans for after retirement?
 
RDL: Teaching has been a very important part of life. I think I’ve more or less accomplished what I would’ve liked to do coming to Harvard, and I had an extraordinarily inspiring two decades with these marvelous Harvard students. But I’m not going to stop teaching, performing, researching and doing my creative work. I have masterclasses lined up in Germany [and] Switzerland and will be attending the Salzburg Music Festival this summer. I’m also working on completing a volume of Mozart fragments with my completion to be published with Henle-Urtext. That being said, I’d also like to lower my pace to a slightly less life-threatening one.

Written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte
Directed by Madeleine F. Bersin '14
Music Directed by Jake H. Wilder-Smith '16
Produced by David C. Manella '14 and Simon A. de Carvalho '14
 
February 5 to February 9
 
For the first time in its 21-year history, Dunster House Opera is venturing outside of the Dunster dining hall and into Agassiz Theater. Its production of Mozart’s “Così fan tutte”— which translates to “women are like that”— features a unique interpretation of Mozart's comedic plot about two young men who attempt to seduce each other's fiancées. While the original opera is set in the 18th century and written in Italian, director Madeleine F. Bersin '14 has opted to set the opera in 1960s America using an English translation.
 "I love this opera, but I feel like you can't do it unless you comment on its problematic aspects," Bersin says. "This way, the sexism becomes more of a joke—it's a way to make a comment on gender without rehashing sexist ways of thinking about gender and society. It's also a lot of fun."
  In addition to changes to the setting and costumes, the production team also used a 20th-century English translation of the lyrics, which they supplemented with passages newly translated by Stewart N. Kramer '12, a former director of the DHO."The new librettos are about making the language more modern and helping it fit the music better," says music director Jake H. Wilder-Smith '16. While these changes help to update the play, Wilder-Smith has also chosen to use a harpsichord, an unusual instrument in the context of the original score, which has been tuned to complement the singers while retaining the original sound of Mozart’s instrumentation.
Chorus member Charlotte L. McKechnie '15 says the modern production brings out the comedy in Mozart's storyline. "This is a great show for people who are new to opera. It's a high-caliber production but at the same time completely approachable," she says. "People sometimes think of opera and picture big women in Viking hats— this is a beautiful set, it’s funny, it’s in English, so it's anything but that!"

On January 30, Dame Helen Mirren was finally able to complete her trophy cabinet full of Oscars, Emmys, and BAFTAs with Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year award. However, instead of playing a queen to win her award, she was surrounded by them as she competed to earn her Pudding Pot in the annual Woman of the Year Roast. The always-elegant Mirren showed a new side as she twerked her way to victory before sitting down to watch a few numbers from the Hasty Pudding’s upcoming show, “Victorian Secrets,” which opens February 7. The Harvard Crimson had a chance to interview Mirren the morning after the festivities to get her take on the most unconventional awards ceremony of her career.
 
The Harvard Crimson: How did you react when you were first told you were Hasty Pudding's Woman of the Year?
 
Helen L. Mirren: I was incredibly thrilled and honored…. I was looking at the list of people—of recipients—and there’s actually not a lot of British women on the list, and so on that level in particular, I was very, very honored to be recognized. I’ve always felt that the Americans were incredibly generous, you know, and it was just a lot of manifestation of that as far as I was concerned.
 
THC: Hasty Pudding's awards ceremony strays quite a bit from the conventional—did you know what to expect coming into the event?
 
HM: Not really, no. They kept giving me these schedules of what would happen, and I could never quite make heads or tails of it.
 
THC: What was the highlight of the ceremony for you?
 
HM: Certainly the highlight was the parade…. I felt like a beauty queen on the back of a car like that.
 
THC: Plus, you were surrounded by so many queens.
 
HM:  Yes! Absolutely, absolutely! My gorgeous ladies in waiting. Yeah, so that was pretty spectacular. Also, it was such a beautiful day…that was really fabulous!
 
THC: As a lover of puddings, what is the first pudding you intend to make in your new pot?
 
HM: Oh, well actually it looks to me like a little lentil pot—some sort of lentil pot thing. There’s also actually a very good Christmas pudding…. It’s the perfect size for a little Christmas pudding, so maybe I’ll make it for next year.
 
THC: I’m sure you’ve already been amply harassed, but what went through your head when you saw the word “twerking” on the poster for charades?
 
HM: I thought, “Oh my God, how am I going to get out of this one?” I tried desperately to get out of it with the motion “T” and then acting out working.… But they of course refused…. Of course, now my friends are all emailing me saying, “Oh, we are seeing pictures of you twerking.” You know, today things get immediately onto the internet. And I knew it, I knew the minute I saw that word, I thought, “Oh God, here we go.”
 
THC: I have to admit, when I saw it, I instantly tweeted about it.
 
HM: Oh, did you? Oh God, yes, absolutely. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide these days.
 
THC: You've played every role from an animated monster to a queen; what role did you have the most fun with?
 
HM: Monsters University was great fun. I’ve always been a massive fan of John Lasseter and Pixar movies…. If they had existed when I was young, that would have been amazing. I came to them as an adult but loved them just as much. That’s what’s brilliant about those movies: they can be enjoyed just as much by an adult as by a child. It’s genius strength of hand to achieve that…. I also just did a film in France, which was a great deal of fun, called “The Hundred-Foot Journey,” which won’t be coming out until later this year, but that was great fun. It was a lovely light movie, filmed in a beautiful place.
 
THC: Have you always wanted to become an actress?
 
HM: Yes…. It was something I was focused on from a quite early, young age—about 13 or 14. I have to say I never imagined at that age that it would be a realistic thing…I didn’t know anyone in the business, and I was living in a small dormitory town—very, very suburban, mundane kind of world. Just it seemed to be dreaming the impossible dream really.
 
THC: Were those around you—your peers and your family—supportive of your decision to pursue acting?
 
HM:  No, not at all. No, my parents absolutely not, and rightfully…I have no complaints about this, but they absolutely thought I was mad and stupid really…. I had trained to be a teacher, so their feeling was that I could get over my madness very rapidly as soon as I didn’t get any work, and then I could be a teacher and I could be secure. And they were absolutely right, but the reality was, I never thought that. I started acting as soon as I left college and never stopped.
 
THC: It seems as though you’re always saying you secretly want to be the “bad girl” or a “badass.” Where does this urge to be bad come from?
 
HM: The badass is always the romantic one in any movie or play. It’s of course the one that everybody knows. It’s an absolute sure-fire starter for a career is to play the baddest person in a film or play. You know, that person always gets all the attention. I think that was why I loved doing “Red,” actually. I got to play this contradictory character of sorts.
 
THC: Would you say that you’re feeling fulfilled at this stage in your life?
 
HM: I think life is constantly challenging, really. You never reach a point where you go, “That’s it.  I’m fulfilled. I’ve done it.” I suspect the whole point of life is that you’re constantly questioning and challenging it…and insecure about certain things. You know, incredible sense of achievement about other things, but the sense of achievement dissipates very fast, it seems…. And it’s time to challenge yourself or put yourself in a dangerous or challenging sort of situation, and maybe ultimately that’s the thing that is fulfilling…. It was sort of amazing to be surrounded by those hugely energetic, very, very bright, optimistic...people with their whole lives ahead of them yesterday. You know, that was very exciting. Exhausting and inspiring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Guys screw up. Girls pine. It is up to the man to make the big gesture when he realizes that this girl is “the one.” He holds up a boombox outside her window or waits for her by his red Porsche. A lady does not attempt reconciliation. It is not becoming.
This is the damsel-in-distress logic to which many romantic comedies adhere. It is, in fact, so commonly ingrained in their plot logic as to approach membership as a staple of the genre. And when, in his newest film, “That Awkward Moment,” Zac Efron’s character urges his friend to “do it like in the movies,” this is what he’s talking about.
At his beckoning, the audience envisions the ’80s teen film heroes for which Emma Stone longs in “Easy A”—John Cusack playing “In Your Eyes” outside his belle’s window in “Say Anything,” or Michael Schoeffling surprising Molly Ringwald in “Sixteen Candles.” Because it is almost always the man that manages to upset the puppy love dynamic established in the second act, it is, according to Hollywood, his duty to chase after his girl. When our leading man (Efron) follows his own advice, he is walking in the footsteps of these men. The audience is to believe it’s chivalry.
For a film that seems to consciously attempt a reversal of romantic comedy tropes, “That Awkward Moment” sure does end up playing right into gender norms. The film is the story of a triple bromance—Jason (Efron), Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), and Daniel (Miles Teller)—that vows to stay single after one of them is cheated on. They each encounter difficulty, however, when they fall in love and attempt to hide it from the others, hastening the inevitable moment in which each couple must ask, “So, where is this going?”
To its credit, the film seems to have dedicated itself from the start to altering gender tropes, a decision that might seem refreshing considering the movie’s place in what we can call the “bromantic” comedy genre. It attempts this, however, by featuring men who engage in conventionally feminine behavior and vice versa—guys, it seems to say, can eat their feelings too, and girls are even more enchanting if they play video games and drink scotch.
In limiting itself to these stereotypes, though, these reversals ultimately accentuate gender roles instead of disproving them. At the start of the film, Jason reprimands Mikey for comforting himself with Ben & Jerry’s when his wife asks for a divorce, asking, “What are you, Bridget Jones?” When we see Mikey and Jason indulge in both ice cream and scotch near the end of the film, we are meant to take this as a genre-conscious demonstration of the pair embracing both their masculine and feminine sides. What it really signifies is a laziness on the part of the writing, which relies heavily on tropes throughout, whether they are spun into faux gender role inversions or not.
What’s more, these attempts at subversiveness are inconsistent. In the end, our main man is still jeopardizing his relationship with the woman he cares about because he is scared of commitment. It’s still his job to go get the girl—an act that prompts the Judd Nelson fist thrust that only reminds the audience of the genre-enforced assertion that it’s the man’s job to fix things.
These failures are made all the more annoying by the circumstances of the characters that enforce them—namely, that each of the main men is in his mid-twenties yet somehow manages to hold down a high-paying job and enjoy a huge loft in Manhattan. Certainly, the Lena Dunham aesthetic should not define every twenty-something film, but perhaps these characters’ oversights when it comes to relationships and gender roles might stem from their upper-middle class, heterosexual environment.
That said, the film is not unfunny. This is largely due to the standout performance of Teller, who is hilarious and charming in nearly every scene, and who seems to have earned laughs through improvisation rather than sticking to the script. The bromance between the film’s three musketeers is enacted believably, with much of the credit going to Teller and Jordan. Efron’s performance leaves something to be desired. His acting as the central character, however, seemed forced and unnatural, whereas his costars gave the onscreen dynamic a more natural, almost improvised air.
Nonetheless, the guys here are still falling in love despite their own sex. The girls are still drinking scotch and playing Xbox despite their own instinct to eat ice cream. Perhaps films whose main character transformations are defined by challenging their trope-enforced condition as men or women, such as Don Jon, might benefit by examining how, in their attempts to be cutting edge, they are saying something quite tired, dismal, and oversimplified about the way that the sexes interact.
Though the bromance charms throughout, at the end of “That Awkward Moment”, it still seems that bromance before romance is the order of the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I” by Gustav Klimt. “The Ghent Altarpiece” by Jan van Eyck. “Madonna of Bruges” by Michelangelo.
These are just a few of the artworks retrieved from over 1,050 repositories in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II. World War II is widely recognized as the deadliest conflict in human history. What is less well-known is that, while soldiers fought to end the war, an entirely different mission was simultaneously in motion: the fight to preserve precious works of art.
 As the Nazis conquered Europe, they seized and transported more than 5 million cultural objects. Had the Nazis been victorious, these objects would have filled the Führermuseum, the unrealized museum Hitler planned to erect in Linz. This would have amounted to the greatest displacement of works of art in history. Fighting against this tremendous theft were the Monuments Men: the members of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, an Allied group tasked with taking back works of art seized by the Nazis. This wasn’t your typical band of soldiers. The MFAA was an elite group comprised of art world professionals: university professors, curators, art historians, and museum directors who donned military apparel and risked their lives for the masterpieces.
The Nazis tended to store the works they looted in salt mines and underground tunnels. In Bernterode Mine, the Monuments Men worked underneath 400,000 tons of explosives in order to recover the coffin of King Frederick the Great of Prussia. At the Kaiserode Mine in Merkers, where the Monuments Men uncovered 400 looted paintings, the group worked in small, dark tunnels that could have collapsed on them at any moment. Attempting to retrieve works from locales such as these was a perilous process. By the conclusion of the war, two of the Monuments Men had been killed in action.
In 2009, Robert M. Edsel immortalized the story of the MFAA in his book “The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History.” A film inspired by the book, aptly titled “The Monuments Men” and starring George Clooney and Matt Damon ’88-’92, promises to bring even more recognition to the achievements of the storied group when it is released on Feb. 7.
The Harvard community can of course claim a connection to any film starring Matt Damon. But the ties that link Harvard to “The Monuments Men” run considerably deeper. In addition to being influential figures in the art world, several key members of the Monuments Men were Harvard affiliates. Paul J. Sachs, Class of 1900, and George L. Stout ’29 were crucial figures in the MFAA, shaping and leading its unusual battle for the arts. James S. Ackerman, Arthur Kingsley Porter professor of fine arts at Harvard from 1960 to 1990, also served in the MFAA. Each of these Harvard affiliates made a significant contribution to the mission of the Monuments Men and helped to ensure that culture was safeguarded in the face of terrible man-made destruction.
Paul J. Sachs: The Organizer
On Dec. 20, 1941, Francis Henry Taylor, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, invited 44 men from the most influential museums in the United States to a conference in New York to discuss their field. Among them was Paul J. Sachs, the associate director of the Fogg Museum. The son of Samuel Sachs, a founding partner of Goldman Sachs, he was a hugely influential figure within the museum community. His connections included major art collectors, bankers, and America’s social elite.
In spite of his privileged background, Sachs did not lead a sheltered life. Experiences prior to World War II made him aware of the potentially disastrous effects war could have on important monuments. In an interview for “The Crimson, Tufts professor of art and art history Andrew L. McClelland makes this clear. “He served in the Red Cross during World War I and was friendly with people who documented monuments during the war,” McClelland says. “Before the United States got involved in World War II, he was already working to protect European monuments against what he considered as great likelihood of great damage.”
 Sachs used Taylor’s conference as an opportunity to publicize the calamitous effects World War II was having on cultural monuments. He showed photos of England’s National Gallery in London deserted; of the Tate Gallery in London filled with shattered glass; of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, where paintings by great Dutch masters were leaned against empty walls. Rembrandt’s “The Night Watch” was stripped from its frame. Michelangelo’s “David” was entombed in brick. Sachs declared before his colleagues, “We must guard jealously all we have inherited from a long past, all we are capable of creating in a trying present, and all we are determined to preserve in a foreseeable future.”
When President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, commissioned the establishment of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program in 1943, Sachs was asked to recommend the group that would come to be known as the Monuments Men. The choice of Sachs led to the creation of a team that included many members of the Harvard community. He filled the program with students from his famous “Museum Work and Museum Problems” class, a lab-based course first offered at Harvard in 1922 that included both hands-on training in the Fogg and lectures about the art of presenting art. “They were obvious [choices], people who had both the management and the connoisseurship skill to be delegated to do this work in Europe,” McClelland says. “They also had extensive exposure to European museums, as travel was something that Sachs always made his students do. His students were familiar with the collections in Europe before the war started and knew how to deal with works that were found in salt mines.”
On the Field: James S. Ackerman
James S. Ackerman had just received his A.B. in art history from Yale when he was drafted by the United States Army. After the military unit he was assigned to prepared to move to Africa, Ackerman applied to become a a part of the MFAA. “I wanted to be doing something interesting,” Ackerman explains in an interview. “A lot of people in my company were just lounging around playing cards, and I thought [serving in the MFAA] was a very intriguing activity.”
Ackerman was given the task of leading members of the Monuments Men around Italy. “At the time, I was just a sergeant, so I was assigned to accompany army cars in Italy when [the Monuments Men] were visiting sites,” Ackerman says. “There were adventures to monuments and [museums].”
One of Ackerman’s most memorable missions was a trip to inspect the condition of Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” in Milan. “People had put a shield over the fresco. When we first uncovered it, it was in an un-restored condition,” Ackerman says. “Very little of the original fresco had been preserved. Even after a lot of restoration happened, it was a long way from looking like the original.”
Ackerman’s assignment also gave him an opportunity to study Italian Renaissance architecture in depth. As a result of his time as a Monuments Man, Ackerman went on to become a major scholar of Italian Renaissance architects, including Michelangelo. “Prior to my service in the war, I didn’t know what I wanted to focus my studies on. But my whole experience in Italy led me to study Italian architecture,” Ackerman says.
George L. Stout: The Conservationist Extraordinaire
If Sachs organized the overall structure of the MFAA, fellow Harvard affiliate George L. Stout quietly managed the technical aspects of the program. Prior to the war, art conservation was a relatively obscure field. During a 1978 interview, Stout said “In the world of the art market, it was vulgar to talk about material and condition. That was as naughty as to inquire about the digestive system of an opera singer.”
The low profile of art conservation did not deter Stout, who began his research on art conservation in 1927. Together with chemist Rutherford J. Gettens ’29, Stout created a standardized way of conserving art based on scientific methods. In addition to being a pioneer on the conservation front, Stout was one of the first people to emphasize the importance of an art preservation program. In an interview for “The Crimson,” Robert Edsel had high praise for Stout. “George Stout is the one who had the earliest vision of what ended up happening with the Monuments Men when nobody else was listening other than Paul Sachs,” Edsel says.
 As a member of the MFAA, Stout handled various challenges that arose during missions. In Normandy, the Monuments Men were tasked with restoring a cathedral in Carentan. Things were going smoothly until the group ran out of printed “Off Limits” signs, and civilians ignored handwritten ones. Stout cleverly prevented further trespassing by using white engineering tape marked: “DANGER: Mines!”Stout was also a key player in the aforementioned mission at Bernterode Mine that led to the discovery of the coffin of Frederick the Great. Engineers calculated that the 1,300-pound coffin couldn’t be lifted by the mine’s elevator shaft, but Stout insisted that if the Nazis had been able to get the coffin into the mine via the shaft, the Allies could get it out that way. Stout was right. As the team successfully brought the coffin back up, the Star Spangled Banner played. It was May 7, 1945; Stout’s moment of triumph had occurred the same day that Germany officially surrendered.
The Mission Continues
Between its establishment in 1943 and its dissolution in 1946, the MFAA succeeded in recovering over 10,000 paintings, sculptures, and other countless cultural objects that decorate our museum walls today. But the ultimate mission of the Monuments Men is far from concluded. Today, the rediscovery, reappropriation, and preservation of works lost during World War II continues to pose challenges. In 2012, more than 1,400 works of art looted during World War II were found in a Munich apartment. Among the trove were works by Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Otto Dix, and Max Liebermann long thought to have been destroyed or lost. The value of these works has been estimated to come in at a whopping $1.4 billion. The owner of the hoard, Cornelius Gurlitt, claims that he legally owns the works. His father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was a dealer who sold so-called “degenerate” art (expressionist and modern art that Hitler banned during his regime) but kept many of the works for himself. Several high-profile restitutions have also occurred in recent years. In 1999 and 2011 respectively, “Odalisque” by Matisse and ““Litzlberg am Attersee” by Klimt were removed from the museums they ended up in after the Allied victory, and restored to the descendents of those who owned them prior to the war.
When it comes to addressing the rediscovery or restitution of works looted during the war, there is a considerable amount of gray area. According to Jutta von Falkenhausen, a Berlin-based lawyer who works on art recovery, each case must be examined individually. “There are several categories which we have to look at carefully,” von Falkenhausen says in an interview for “The Crimson.” “We may have cases [that] they call ‘degenerate art.’ The Nazis confiscated the works, but some of them were bought as well. There are also cases in which people tried to do the decent thing at the time. You had art collectors who would buy [Jewish owners’] art so they would have the money to get to some safe harbor.”
Executive Director of Europe for the Commission of Art Recovery, Agnes Peresztegi, added that the artwork’s current location further complicates the issue. “Whether the artwork is currently in a private or a public collection or whether it is possessed by an individual [determines what] legal and or political issues are presented and what solutions may be found in attempting to have the work returned,” Peresztegi says.
Numerous nations, including France, the United States, Russia, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, have attempted to collaborate to solve these issues. “The Washington Conference Principles, the Vilnius Forum Declaration, and the Terezin Declaration state that all efforts should be deployed to return the Holocaust-era looted artworks and find just and fair solutions to such claims,” Peresztegi says.
But such agreements lack legal teeth. “This is morally binding, not a law. This is an obligation that some countries took very seriously, such as Austria. Austria enacted a restitution law, which requires public institutions and national museums to find and identify art that may have been looted. The nice thing about Austria is that they have a real law, and this is what they’ve been doing quite effectively,” von Falkenhausen says. “Some museums have been doing this with great energy, others not so much. Many try to stall.”
Von Falkenhausen believes that museums haven’t reacted fully engaged with the problem, partly because it is hard to part with artwork that they have taken care of for an extended period of time. “You [the museum] are the good guy because you take care of the art. And here comes the rich person, represented by a big New York law firm[,] that says that this beautiful work is ours. Then they sell it at Sotheby’s for a million dollars. If you are a curator, your instinct is to say[,] ‘I want the public to have access to this,’” she says.
Edsel says he hopes that his book and the upcoming film will shore up the legacy of the MFAA while also bringing attention to the ongoing nature of the issue of art preservation. “I want the film and the book to shake the snow globe and get people more engaged and debating,” Edsel says. He also stresses the ongoing need to protect cultural monuments. In recent years, a lack of U.S. military preparation caused the looting and burning of the Iraq National Library and the looting of the Iraq National Museum, as well as bombings of cultural monuments such as the Al-Askari Mosque and Shrine Complex in Samarra. Similar cultural tragedies are currently unfolding in war-plagued Syria.
The story of the Monuments Men sheds light on the fact that there are different kinds of war casualties and inspires future generations to fight against the kind of destructiveness that brings about both cultural and human losses. Edsel articulates this best when articulating the impact he hopes his book and the film will have. “We have to put the legacy to use to protect future monuments.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Sometimes I feel out of place on the train with a book in my hands. With smartphones flanking me on either side and an upmarket tablet across the aisle, I hold a paperback novel with the color and ungainly thickness of challah bread. The fact that I would bring anything along that demands not only full attention but also both my hands seems unnecessarily antiquated. Soon enough, with the imminence of Google Glass, it may soon be excessive that entertainment should occupy any hands at all.
In its 2007 report, “To Read or Not To Read,” the National Endowment for the Arts revealed that 23 percent of Americans had not read a single book during the past year. But that is all of America. If there were one place for pleasure reading to thrive and proliferate, it would be a place like Harvard College. Nevertheless, even here an active habit of reading seems to have become an idiosyncratic quirk like badminton rather than a staple of a well-rounded life. It is now more distinctive a character trait to claim that you read novels than to say that you watch movies. 
Everyone watches movies. But for some reason, not everyone reads.
After all, Harvard students do not have time to read. This explanation is familiar to anyone who has experienced the hurricane of a Harvard semester.  But ultimately, when anyone says, “I do not have time for X,” what they truly mean is, “I do not value X enough to allocate time for it.” People do have the free time to keep up with television shows, surf Facebook, and hang out with other friends. How to divide that time becomes a question of priorities rather than capability.
And maybe we are correct not to set aside time for reading. When you live on a college campus with 400 student organizations, 45 things to do on any given night, and 6,647 other brilliant minds to probe, you could compellingly argue that reading is a waste of your time and a waste of your parents’ money. The opportunity cost has never been higher for an activity that is not only inherently solitary but also universally available throughout your life. And so we stash our reading lists and wait for a more settled future when the Friday nights do not pound so loudly and the ambition does not burn so bright.
It is a convincing case. More often than not, my books will remain unread for precisely these reasons, because of classes, activities, or impromptu midnight hangouts. Perhaps college is the time when it is hardest to read. But I also believe that our college years are the time of our lives when we need literature most. We need books for precisely the reason that we do not read them—because we consider college one of the most critical and decisive junctions in our life. 
Borne against our will toward the crossroads—the terrifying reality of post-graduation and tangible adulthood—we are scrambling to maintain our academic standards, form potentially lifelong connections, and figure out the very meaning and purpose of our confusing lives. But how can we make our lives' biggest decisions using only the thin slice of experience that our 18 to 22 years have given us? This is why we need books more than ever. Reading stretches the boundaries of our experiences and allows us to live other lives vicariously that we will never experience for ourselves. We have spent our entire existence as a human race trying to figure out how to live. The collective wisdom of our findings lies in literature and books. 
Stories are essentially worlds that allow us to test out another life. Writers have created worlds so real that we taste the cinnamon in their cocoa and brush against the linens of their bedrooms. It is in literature that we can experience the bitterness of ambition taken too far in “Macbeth,” grapple with the isolation of being an immigrant in search of a better life in “Unaccustomed Earth,” and suffer both the rush and the pain of marital infidelity in “Anna Karenina.” Literature is fossilized amber that preserves pieces of the human experience for us to examine and magnify in search of truths to bring into our own lives. 
Here at Harvard, I am often overwhelmed by the unknowable future that lies on the other end of commencement. I stand paralyzed—hungry for the experience and knowledge that 20 years has not yet given me enough of.  Sometimes, I turn to parents, tutors, and professors for guidance. Other times, I only need to turn to my bookshelf and behold centuries of thought on the examined and meaningful life. 
Like many at this place, I am asking a most human question: How ought I to live? To start, read deeply.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It seemed a simple enough question. Six words requiring a one-word answer. But the inability of Harvard students to answer it correctly, or to answer it at all, would become a global spectacle and among Flyby’s most popular features of 2013. The clip of the stumbling attempts lasted only 56 seconds. And yet it left us all wondering what we would have said had we been asked, “What is the capital of Canada?”
 
The reaction to the video around campus and among the general population was predictably frenzied. Some basked in the schadenfreude of seeing the Icarean fall. The Huffington Post ran with the headline, “Harvard Students Don’t Know the Capital of Canada and They Can’t Stand It.” The original video has over a million views.
 
Others were indignant in their defense of the students filmed. I heard some shout across the dining hall, “Who cares about the capital of Canada?” stopping just short of bursting into a chorus of “USA, USA, USA.” More tactful defenders pointed out that Ottawa is “just the administrative capital, anyway,” thereby emphasizing their own knowledge of the correct answer but also allowing that it might be permissible for others to miss that bit of trivia.
 
Before proceeding further, I should make two quick clarifications. First, I do not believe that the majority of Harvard students do not know the capital of Canada. The Harvard Crimson is not above a cheeky bit of clever editing. Second, I do not believe that the ambushed students featured in the video are necessarily parochial and unworldly. No doubt many of them took Gov 20 as freshmen and, as the Program on General Education recommends, are continuing to live “beyond the ivied walls.”
 
But the video debacle raises a more complex question: How is it that some Harvard students study the role of women in Korean art or Mesoamerican writing systems without knowing the capital city of a country right next door?
 
Back when neighboring tribes and nations constantly lived in fear of war, such woeful ignorance of one’s surroundings would be a sure sign of doom. Today, we can afford to be complacent. We trade in greater volumes and study with wider reach. Our leaders talk of peace in the tired tone of assuredness. In short, globalization has bought us a permissive proximity that has allowed us to remain relatively ignorant of the rest of world—to know of our neighbors rather than to know them.
 
The caricature of the brash American tourist abroad becomes more alarming when one considers that Americans with a passport are in the minority. Former Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg has said of United States Congressmen and women, “I’ll bet you a bunch of these people don’t have passports.” He may be right: According to CNN, only 30 percent of over 308 million citizens of the United States have passports.
 
Though graduates of an elite college like Harvard are probably less likely to number among the 70 percent without a passport, the problem of parochialism is one that they, too, must confront. One way to start might be to redefine our understanding of parochialism. Breadth of education and the accumulation of airline mileage points are not indicators of worldliness, and, conversely, their absence is not a symptom of narrow-mindedness. Even through study and travel, many stick to the comfortable goal of “knowing of” other people and nations. They confine themselves to an endless gap year of detached observation.
 
In Plato’s “Crito,” Socrates claims that anyone who “stands his ground” in residence in a state consents to the reach of its laws and institutions. In other words, residence is the starting point of our obligations to the nation. I argue that we need a more refined view of our duty as citizens. We owe an obligation, not merely to submit to the government of the country in which we choose to live, but to enhance our country’s functions through the knowledge we gain when we journey elsewhere. Fulfilling such a duty requires us to look beyond the borders of our country in travel, study, and thought and to genuinely engage with the world around us.
 
Having spent a semester comping the Harvard Crimson, I am still not entirely sure what Flyby exists to do. But I do hope that the Roving Reporter continues to rove, asking questions about faraway lands. The answers they find will be a weathervane for our outlook. And just perhaps, more people will know the capital of Mexico.

President Obama’s much-anticipated speech on reforms to the runaway National Security Agency began with a bad history lesson and only got worse. 
 “At the dawn of our Republic, a small, secret surveillance committee, born out of the Sons of Liberty, was established in Boston,” he said. “Throughout American history, intelligence has helped secure our country and our freedoms.”
 But if there were anything akin to the NSA’s mass surveillance of millions of Americans on the basis of a single, secret court ruling or the FBI’s infamous national security letters issued without a prior judicial ruling, it would be King George III’s regime of general warrants and writs of assistance, which allowed British custom agents to search any private residence.
 If Lord North’s government had metadata rather than muskets, the Revolution would have failed, with the Founding Fathers jailed and executed for treason. James Otis, Jr., coiner of the “taxation without representation is tyranny” motto and—most importantly—Harvard Class of 1743, for five hours inveighed against writs of assistance in the 1761 Paxton Case, calling them “the worst instrument of arbitrary power … ever found in an English law-book.”
 Few provisions of the Constitution were so directly shaped by colonial experiences as the Fourth Amendment. It declaimed: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” 
Now, the one-time constitutional law professor defends the unconstitutional and legalizes the once illegal. In classic Obama fashion, the speech largely endorsed the claims of his critics while also censuring them for not trusting his vaunted judgment.
 Half-hearted and superficial as they were, the reforms that President Obama endorsed on the recommendations of his review panel—installing a privacy advocate in the secretive Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court and requiring judicial orders to search metadata databases that the government would no longer house—are tacit acknowledgment of a system gone awry. 
 To underscore this point, it is far from certain that these programs actually work. An exhaustive report from the New America Foundation debunks the much-inflated successes of the security state, finding that “surveillance of American phone metadata has had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism.” Judges bemoan the agency’s “systemic” violations and evasions. Even a Deputy Director of the NSA, John Inglis, was forced to concede that the bulk data collection had prevented at most one terrorist attack. 
 But while the administration acknowledges that there were legitimate concerns with the scope and size of the surveillance programs and “welcomes a discussion of the tradeoffs between security and civil liberties,” it still relentlessly pursues the man who triggered the debate, Edward Snowden, for violations of the Espionage Act.
The American people had as much right to know their government had secretly misconstrued a section of the Patriot Act on the basis of secret judgments issued by secret courts to intrude on the privacy of millions as they did to learn the information Daniel Ellsberg leaked via the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. They had as much right as they did, when burglars broke into an FBI office in 1971, to see the details of J. Edgar Hoover’s racist, petty, and vindictive surveillance of a laundry list of suspected dissidents from communist organizers to Martin Luther King Jr. and John Steinbeck.
For every period of civil liberties overreach in American history, self-correction has inevitably emerged. Hoover’s excesses and Nixon’s messes gave rise to the Church Committee, whose recommendations are the backbone of current surveillance law. The Federalist Party’s Alien and Sedition Acts threatened to derail the nascent republic, but President Jefferson wisely let the Sedition Act expire rather than continue to wield it against opponents. (Unnervingly though, the Alien Act, allowing the president to eject unnaturalized citizens of a foreign country at war with the U.S., remains on the books.)
 The glacial pace of Obama’s reforms and his sly insistence on congressional debate—where all bills but the Helium Stewardship Act or Small Airplane Revitalization Act die slow, painful deaths—all but ensure that the self-correction has yet to arrive.
But Obama can start by granting Snowden the clemency he deserves.
 To close with another history lesson: In 1777, Commodore Esek Hopkins of the Continental Navy assisted in the torture of British sailors. Two whistle-blowers, Richard Marven and Samuel Shaw, reported the misdeed to Congress, which duly relieved Hopkins of duty. Hopkins promptly sued Marven and Shaw for libel.
Congress, rather than shirk, instead instructed a certain “Sam. Adams” to see that the gentlemen’s legal fees were paid and enacted its first whistle-blower protection law on July 30, 1778, noting, “It is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States … to give the earliest information to Congress of any misconduct, frauds, or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the services of these states.”
 Edward Snowden did just that, and he shouldn’t have to live a life of exile and infamy for it.

As opposition protests escalate in Ukraine, the county’s situation remains both violent and uncertain. On Sunday, opposition figures filled Kiev’s main square, demanding a restructuring of the government and removal of its leadership, currently headed by President Viktor Yanukovich.
 
The protests, which are entering their third month, originated in response to President Yanukovich’s decision to accept funding and natural gas subsidies from Russia, symbolically shifting his country closer to Moscow, and further from the European Union. Refusing to accept the opposition’s demands, President Yanukovich has jailed many protestors and passed legislation restricting protest meetings, which he only just repealed.
 
While we approve of President Yanukovich’s recent decision to sign legislation revoking restrictions on protest meetings, his response has been inadequate in light of the widespread human rights violations and restrictions on speech that still exist. And while we recognize the difficulties posed to the state by protestors remaining in state buildings and on the streets, we believe that the state should not see imprisonment as the solution to the issues at hand. Instead, the state has the responsibility to answer to its citizens and take their wishes into account.
 
To that end, we disapprove of President Yanukovich’s rejection of broad political and trade accords with the European Union in exchange for monetary support from Russia. The duration and potency of the opposition protests suggest that many Ukrainians wish to affiliate with Europe and develop their relationship with the West, and the Ukrainian government’s decision to ignore these desires is an abandonment of its responsibilities. Consequently, the government should accept the attempts of Europe and the United States to facilitate a resolution to the conflict, and should work to ensure that the wishes of the Ukrainian people are respected.
 We likewise condemn Russia’s attempts to bully its way in Eastern Europe. The issue in Ukraine is only the latest in a troubling trend of Russian aggression with former Soviet Republics. With its own long-term growth prospects still on questionable footing, Russia should instead recognize the potential benefits of European integration and heightened economic ties with the West. At a minimum, Ukraine and its people deserve the right to make a similar choice for themselves.

A day before the world premiere of “The Monuments Men” starring Matt P. Damon '88-'92, Robert M. Edsel, author of the New York Times bestseller on which the movie is based, spoke at the Institute of Politics about the historical legacy and implications of the story behind the novel and film. Damon joined the event via a live Skype feed.
“The Monuments Men” tells the true story of a group of museum directors, curators, art historians, and artists who helped find pieces of art stolen by the Nazis during World War II. According to Edsel, the upcoming movie is a call to action to recognize the vital role that art plays in society.
“We have to show respect for the cultural preferences of others,” he said.
The panel, which was the IOP’s first John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event for the spring semester, was moderated by Joan Shorenstein fellow Diane McWhorter and also featured Lucia Allais, a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
During the event, Edsel recalled that when he first heard about the story of “The Monuments Men” several years ago, he thought it was the most exciting piece of history he had ever heard.
“I think when you see the film many people will feel that way too,” he said at the event, which was livestreamed to audiences at the University of Southern California, Arizona State University, and the University of Texas at Austin, as part of the IOP’s national campaign.
Edsel said that he is excited that the story of “The Monuments Men” will now finally be heard, because it has received far less media attention than deserved over the last half century. The movie, which was directed by and also stars George Clooney, has already received praise from film critics.
Damon agreed that audiences need to know and learn more about the Monuments Men.
“[This story] is something that all of us should have learned about,” he said.
 “For all you women who have gone to all these World War II movies with us guys, this is your movie,” Edsel added.
Several students who were present at the event had already seen information about the upcoming movie and came to learn more.
“I saw the trailers for the movie and I was really interested. It’s a topic that I personally didn’t know about,” Yesenia L. Jimenez ’17 said.
“I’m really excited to go see the movie, to see the portrayal of it. It’s definitely something that everyone should know about,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Feb. 4, 2014, at 1:25 a.m.
Before Facebook swept the globe and attracted more than one billion users, it got its start in a Kirkland House dorm room on Feb. 4, 2004 as an internal directory for Harvard undergraduates, running on a single server at a cost of $85 per month.
A lot has changed in 10 years. Today, the site that was started as an internal social network for Harvard students is accessible to anyone with an internet connection. It trades at more than $61 per share on the NASDAQ stock market. Its founder, Mark E. Zuckerberg, formerly of the Class of 2006, is thought to be worth nearly $30 billion.
While today’s Facebook experience may revolve around status updates, news feeds, and photos, the networking site that exploded on Harvard’s campus a decade ago offered undergraduates just a few basic functions. Still, looking back on the site’s earliest days, its first users, Harvard undergraduates, say that adding friends, finding classmates, and ‘poking’ fellow users was enough to completely upturn social interactions on campus.
“It felt like within the first month or so everyone was on it, at some point,” said Chad Brown ‘07, recalling the many conversations about thefacebook he overheard in Harvard dining halls during the spring of 2004. “It was something that people talked about a lot.”
From the beginning, Harvard was hooked.
FROM FACEMASH TO FACEBOOK
The concept of an online collection of faces and biographical information was nothing new for Harvard students. While there existed a searchable directory for the freshman class, the rest of the College was organized by House, and each maintained a separate, and often restricted, rolodex of faces and phone numbers, as well as a print edition.
 
“Everybody wanted access to a face book for upperclassmen,” said Connie Zong ‘06, a member of Zuckerberg’s class year.
In October of his sophomore year, Zuckerberg himself had entered the social fray by launching facemash, a short-lived site that asked users to choose the more attractive of two Harvard student identification photos, which had been lifted from individual House directories.
The site attracted the ire of numerous student groups across campus, more than 20,000 hits in 24 hours online, and the attention of the College’s Administrative Board. Zuckerberg quickly apologized, both in an interview with The Crimson and in numerous letters to campus groups.
And though the Administrative Board declined to send Zuckerberg home for the breaches, the young programmer had forged a reputation.
“We all knew Zuckerberg for getting in trouble with the Ad Board for Facemash,” remembered Zong in an interview last week. “Facemash was such a big hit.”
If facemash was short lived, it highlighted anew the need for a campus-wide social directory. Cameron S.H. Winklevoss ‘04, Tyler O.H. Winklevoss ‘04, and Divya K. Narendra ‘04 saw a similar need and approached Zuckerberg for help in going a step further and establishing a social network along the lines of Myspace or Friendster, but exclusively for Harvard students.
Zuckerberg’s work with the Winklevoss group would eventually result in a lawsuit, but by the first week in February, shopping week at the College, Zuckerberg was ready to launch his own site. thefacebook.com went live on a Wednesday.
Overnight, the site took off. Within 24 hours, thefacebook had 650 registered users; within two weeks, 4,300 had created accounts. The first invitations, sent out by Zuckerberg and friends over a few campus email lists, had spread like wildfire.
“I remember getting an email from a close friend of mine...with an invitation saying ‘so and so has invited you to join thefacebook.com,’” Samuel L. Sanker ‘05 remembered. “I logged in and it was so early...it was just a very, very bare bones user interface, and from the day that I signed up, I just thought that it was the greatest thing in the world.”
Brandon M. Terry ’05 recalled being taken immediately by the clean aesthetics and intimate community the site offered.
“This site was only your friends...from college,” he said. “It was strange how you could lose so much time on this site.”
Zuckerberg, for his part, was unapologetically proud of his accomplishment and the speed with which he had pulled it off.
“Everyone’s been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard,” he told The Crimson on Feb. 9, 2004. “I think it’s kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week.”
A NEW SOCIAL NETWORK
Within weeks of thefacebook’s launch, the site began to develop its own unique profile, supplanting competitors and integrating itself into undergraduate life. Only Harvard undergrads could sign up, making the online community far more intimate—and seemingly secure—than those offered by MySpace and Friendster, early users say.
“You had to have a harvard.edu address, which made it a lot less sketchy,” Zong said. “With MySpace, you could get spammed really easily by people in the area, and I think a lot of people felt uncomfortable.”
One feature on the initial site, Coursematch, allowed users to see which classes their friends were taking.
“You could enter the courses that you were taking that semester, and for people that were interested in forming study groups it was the perfect thing,” Sanker said.
Another feature allowed users to “poke” their friends using the site. The meaning of this ambiguous term was never officially clarified, but that did not stop Harvard students from using it.
“Let’s say some girl would add me on Facebook who I hadn’t really met,” Brown said in an interview last week. “I’d be talking to my roommates and ask, ‘What do you think about this? What does this mean? Is she interested? I’m not sure what to think?’ So they’d say, ‘Well, send her a poke and see what happens.’”
“I like the poke,” Brown added.
The features added a new dimension to social interactions on campus, early users say.
“We weren’t quite sure how the online social dynamic was going to play out in real life,” said Barbara Eghan ‘05. Because the concept of online “friendship” was so new, Eghan explained, “it felt like a really big deal to say you were friends with somebody, or to unfriend somebody.”
“We weren’t quite sure what the rules of it were,” she added. “If you reject somebody as a friend or ignore their request, are they going to get a note that says you’ve rejected them?”
 
That dynamic was quickly complicated further as the network began to expand beyond Cambridge. By March, the site had gained strong footholds at Columbia, Stanford, and Yale and attracted its 10,000th subscriber.
But amid the social network’s rapid success, some users at Harvard worried that thefacebook’s expansion might alter their experience with the site.
“There was this chatter among the early users that it was losing its exclusivity, losing what made it special,” Eghan said.
DROPPING OUT
As the site grew and questions proliferated, so too did the profile of its creator.
By the time Zuckerberg sat for his final exams in May 2004, thefacebook had undergone nationwide expansion and was approaching its 100,000th user. When Zuckerberg finished those finals, he and his team—Dustin A. Moskovitz '06-'07, Andrew K. McCollum ’06-’07, and a group of interns—headed for Palo Alto, Calif. In June, the company changed its name to Facebook. Co-founder Eduardo Saverin '06 did not make the trip to Palo Alto. Christopher R. Hughes '06, who did, ultimately stayed on as the company's spokesperson, but Saverin was soon pushed out of the company.
Zuckerberg never came back to Harvard as a student. He did return after dropping out in 2005 to build the staff of his growing company.
Eghan recalled early recruitment events, often staged outside the Science Center, noting that  they were “heavily attended” by undergraduates. On another occasion, Zuckerberg, in sandals and a t-shirt, appeared before a meeting of CS50.
“[There were] a lot of computer science people who were interested to know how they could get involved,” Eghan said.  “It was the idea of being part of something that was blowing up, and we were watching it blow up right in front of our faces, which was a really cool thing.” 
Some, like Zong, regret not following the armada of Harvard students to Facebook.
“A lot of people [from my class] then went to work at Facebook,” Zong said. “I kind of kick myself for not looking into that opportunity. I don’t think any of us expected it to get as big as it did.”
But while Facebook maintained its special relationship with Harvard as an employer, Harvard lost its privileged place in the social network. 
“I think the core goal of connecting with people is the same,” said Brown, whose Facebook timeline, like those of many of his classmates, stretches back a decade. “I think that it has added change in that it is less exclusive, it’s become a more inclusive platform that allows people to stay up with each other, and I think that’s been a positive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Feb. 6, 2014, at 4:00 p.m.
For the first time, Harvard University Dining Services began allowing students to place weekly orders for bagged meals instead of having them complete the request form each time. Previously, the HUDS “Meal-to-Go” online system accepted only one-time orders.
“We added this option based on student feedback, and hope it helps students who regularly find themselves off-campus during regular meal periods for work or internships or classes across the river,” HUDS Director for Marketing and Communications Crista Martin said in an emailed statement.
The new change came as a result of an initiative started by the Undergraduate Council last semester. The Council's Student Life Committee initiated the project in order to allow students to have the opportunity to have bag meals repeated weekly if needed. 
Students said that the new website function would ensure that they would not forget to order a bagged lunch when they could not make it to a dining hall.
“I think the new repeatable order function is quite useful because if people order a bagged lunch, they probably have a schedule that dictates that they have to do it every week,” Ashley D. Dozier ’14 said. “It would be nice for them to not have to remember to put the order in every Tuesday night.”
Several students noted that Harvard’s class scheduling structure can make it difficult to find the time to eat in a dining hall.
“Given my schedule this semester, I’m in class on Thursday from ten to five and I have only one hour for lunch,” Kenard G. Dillon ’17 said.  “So this would be a really convenient thing for me, especially in between classes.”
The new online system only allows for the same type of meal to be repeated every week. If a student decides to change one of the menu items in a repeat meal, he or she must create a completely new order. Students said that this is a minor problem.
“To be honest, Annenberg is already monotonous in its food for every two weeks, so having the same meal for the same day wouldn’t motivate you to eat everything,” Ash S. Asencios ’17. said. “You would probably get sick of it really quickly.”
Still, most students said that they were happy to see the system change. “Regardless though, I appreciate HUDS workers doing this to make our lives easier,” Dillon added. “As much as we would like to complain, at least they are trying to make it easier.”
 
Notice of this new change was put up in the table announcements throughout the dining halls, but several students said that they have not heard of the recent development.
 
“I haven’t heard about it until now,” Asencios said. “They should have just sent us an email telling us about this change. If they did, I would have probably known about it.”
 
Students can order breakfast, lunch and dinner through the HUDS website. Bagged meals can be ordered up until 4 a.m. of the requested delivery day.

Although Herbert “Herbie” J. Hancock is a world-renowned Jazz pianist and composer, he once struggled with his future as a student at Grinnell College. Stuck between his passion for music and the practical skills of a degree in electrical engineering, Hancock ultimately chose music and has not looked back since.
Hancock delved into these personal experiences, as well as the core values of jazz music during a lecture in Sanders Theatre on Monday.
Hancock, the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry, the first African-American to hold the prestigious position, gave the first in a series of six lectures entitled “The Ethics of Jazz,” presented by the Mahindra Humanities Center.
The first lecture, entitled, “The Wisdom of Miles Davis” tied Hancock’s personal memories of the legendary trumpet player and bandleader to broader lessons about racism, ethics, and Buddhism.
During the lecture, which included some piano playing, Hancock touched on both the serious and lighter aspects of Davis’s life.
“He loved fast cars, boxing, fast women, and, oh yeah, music,” Hancock said of Davis. “He was a man of few words, but he knew how to listen.”
During one memorable concert while Hancock was playing with the legendary Miles Davis Quintet, the group was on a roll, Hancock remembered. However, right in the middle of Davis’s solo, Hancock played a wrong chord.
The chord sounded off, but Davis’s next notes made the mistake sound like part of the flow of the song, Hancock recalled.
“This experience became groundbreaking for me and opened the door to the future of my performances,” Hancock said.
Not only did Hancock draw values of courage and trust from the moment, but he also took away the Buddhist lesson that notes are neither right nor wrong.
 
Hancock enumerated other similarities he has found between Buddhism and jazz throughout the event.
“In jazz we don’t hide our discoveries from others,” Hancock said.
In one instance, Hancock was called to a practice session at Davis’ New York home, when Davis left the practice room and went upstairs for a while.
“Miles actually listened to us through the intercom in the bedroom...he wanted to hear us play unencumbered,” Hancock recounted.
However, the night was also filled with lighter stories, as Hancock mixed life lessons with anecdotes.
 
From the time that Hancock beat Miles Davis in a car race on the streets of New York at 4 a.m., to when a manager yelled, “You’re gonna regret this,” after Hancock quit his job at a post office so that he could play a local jazz gig.
 
“One thing I’ve learned is to always be a student,” Hancock said. “Don’t be too quick to say no.”
 
Ingrid T. Monson, a music professor currently teaching a class entitled “Herbie Hancock’s Musical Worlds,” invited her students to attend the lecture.
 
“It’s absolutely historic that Herbie Hancock is doing these lectures,” Monson said. “I couldn’t be happier, I think it’s really nice to be able to do a course and do it in conjunction with the many wonderful guests we have on campus.”
 
Bjorn Kuhnicke, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who attended the lecture, said he enjoyed Hancock’s style.
 
“It was an interesting way of preaching, I liked it.”

Thefts on campus spiked over the past week in several of the River Houses, where items ranging from laptops to cameras to coats were reported stolen, police reports show.
On Sunday, the Harvard University Police Department received reports of three Apple MacBook Pros stolen from Leverett House G Tower, according to the public police logs. A North Face coat, a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses, and a container full of coins were also reported stolen from Leverett F Tower.
In addition, HUPD received theft reports from residents of Mather House on Jan. 26 and Jan. 31, Dunster House on Jan. 28, and Quincy House sometime last week.
 
Ginny C. Fahs ’14, a Fifteen Minutes Magazine editor, said her suite in Quincy has been broken into multiple times this academic year. According to Fahs, she and her roommates had their belongings stolen from their room in November and again in December shortly before returning home for the winter break.
“All in all, we've had three laptops, an iPad, an Xbox, and a lot of alcohol stolen,” Fahs said.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email to The Crimson on Monday that in almost all of the incidents of theft, dorm room doors were either unlocked, propped open, or taped to prevent them from locking.
Mather House Co-Master Michael D. Rosengarten confirmed that the laptop stolen at Mather was left in a dorm with the door propped open.
Neither Dunster House Co-Master Roger B. Porter nor Leverett House Co-Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 would provide specific details regarding the crimes.
“I don't think that it would be appropriate for me to comment on the details while the HUPD are still gathering information,” Georgi said.
In his statement to The Crimson, Catalano emphasized students’ responsibility in keeping their own belongings safe.
“When leaving their own rooms, residents should keep the room and/or suite doors locked at all times, even when going down the hall for only a few minutes,” he wrote.
“Residents should not hold an outside door open for strangers or allow strangers to ‘piggyback' on their access card.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Course lotteries are designed to make the process for enrollment in high-demand courses more equitable, but students and professors at the College who have been involved in lotteries say that, particularly in General Education courses, the arrangment is often frustrating and inconvenient.
Course lotteries, which have existed at the College for at least 30 years, mandate that students enter a preferential or non-preferential lottery for classes that cannot accommodate the number of students interested in enrolling. Factors that could limit enrollment include classroom size and the number of teaching fellows assigned to a given course.
Students interviewed for this story said that they have felt the pressure from such tight restrictions on enrollment in some courses.
Jacob R. Carrel ’16, who was lotteried into a class last semester, said that the combination of course lotteries and shopping week augments students’ stress during their first week of classes.
“It can be really frustrating,” Carrel said. “Especially if you’re looking for an outside job or internship and need to know your schedule.”
Another common complaint from students and professors is that the course lotteries run too close to the study card deadline.
For Computer Science 20: “Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science," professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said that while his course did not have a lottery, he was still signing as many as two to four study cards for every student, a precaution that many undergraduates take in the event they do not get lotteried into their desired course.
“There were all these students who were waiting on lotteries for General Education courses, and that just seemed bizarre and unfortunate,” he said.
Some classes, like United States and the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” gave preference to students who had entered the lottery in previous semesters but were not accepted. Others courses, like History of Science 153: “History of Dietetics,” gave preference to concentrators.
Still, some courses retain non-preferential lotteries in which they do not take into account a student’s class year, concentration, or Gen Ed needs.
“In general, I’d prefer not to have to [lottery]. It’s only really used in cases to benefit the students,” said John Huth, professor of Science of the Physical Universe 26: “Primitive Navigation,” whose course lottery was non-preferential.
“We didn’t approach this lightly, and we tried not to lottery the course,” he added.
Other professors said that pre-term planning did not accurately predict enrollment numbers for the spring semester.
Steven Shapin, the professor for History of Science 15, said pre-term planning had predicted an expected enrollment of 22 students, but about 60 students expressed interest during shopping week, Shapin wrote in an email to The Crimson. Through a lottery, Shapin ultimately accepted 42 students, with the expectation that some would choose not to enroll in the course.
“Neither prior experience nor pre-term planning allowed us to anticipate this demand,”  Shapin wrote.
 
Though some students who do not lottery into a course can get accepted off a waitlist, Charles A. Scherr ’17 said that after being waitlisted for History 97e: “Commodities in International History,” he emailed the professor, to no avail.
 
“I was sort of disappointed,” Scherr said. “No one on the waitlist got in.”

Mark E. Zuckerberg
Mark E. Zuckerberg currently serves as the Chairman and CEO of Facebook, Inc., and is the twenty-fifth richest person in the United States with a net worth of $19 billion, according to Forbes. In 2011, Zuckerberg returned to Cambridge, where he visited Harvard and MIT to recruit new employees and meet with administrators. In the same year, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg, who played Zuckerberg in Academy Award-winning film “The Social Network.”
 
He currently resides in Palo Alto with his wife Priscilla Chan ’07, whom he met at a party thrown by Harvard fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi. Although he is still focused on Facebook, he has become involved with non-profits FWD.us and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. Zuckerberg has become an education advocate, notably donating $100 million to Newark, NJ to improve its public schools. Zuckerberg has joined the ranks of Michael Bloomberg, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett in pledging to donate at least half of his wealth to charity.
 
Eduardo L. Saverin ’05
Co-founder of Facebook and the company’s first CFO, Eduardo L. Saverin ’05 was Zuckerberg’s friend and provided the company’s initial funding. After a dispute chronicled in the movie, “The Social Network”, Saverin left Facebook, but he still owns 2.2% of the company, which is now worth about $2.65 billion. Saverin has spent his post-Facebook career as an angel investor, notably investing in startup app Qwiki.
 
Although Saverin renounced his U.S. citizenship shortly before the Facebook went public, which some thought to be a form of tax evasion, he has made himself comfortable in his adopted home of Singapore. He is often spotted driving in a Bentley, and enjoys celebrity-status at Singapore nightclubs. According to an article in The Daily Mail, Saverin “glides around Singapore, where he now lives, in a Bentley, alighting on one champagne-fuelled party after another.”
 
Christopher R. Hughes ’06 
Christopher R. Hughes ’06, unlike Moskovitz and Zuckerberg, returned to Harvard and graduated with his class, but continued to work as Facebook’s leading spokesman. As the buzz around Facebook continued to build, Hughes shocked many by leaving the company in January 2007, opting to join the campaign team of a then-presidential candidate, Barack Obama. Hughes helped create BarackObama.com, which used social networking to rally grassroot support. After the resounding successes of his first two ventures, Hughes purchased a majority stake in the financially strapped magazine The New Republic and appointed himself editor in chief. There, he has implemented many changes to revive its flagging readership. On June 30, 2012, Hughes married his longtime boyfriend Sean Eldridge, who is currently running for Congress in New York. Hughes’ net worth rests around $850 million.
 
Dustin A. Moskovitz  
Characterized by Forbes as the world’s youngest billionaire, Dustin A. Moskovitz was Zuckerberg’s roommate and one of the original Facebook co-founders. After leaving the company in 2008, Moskovitz went on to co-found and become CEO of Asana, a company that produces software to make professional collaboration easier. Moskovitz lives in San Francisco, is engaged to former Wall Street Journal reporter Cari Tuna, and, according to Forbes, still bikes to work and flies commercial despite his $5.2 billion fortune. Earlier this year, Moskovitz bumped into the Winklevoss brothers at Nevada music festival Burning Man, a confrontation that ended in them becoming Facebook friends.
 
Andrew K. McCollum ’06 
Andrew K. McCollum ’06 was Zuckerberg’s classmate and a designer at Facebook, creating Facebook’s first logo. He dropped out of Harvard to join Facebook, but after leaving the company in 2006, returned to complete his degree in computer science. After graduation, McCollum went on to co-found JobSpice, an internet company that helps people make resumes. Currently, he’s an entrepreneur-in-residence at New Enterprise Associates and a partner at Fresh Pond Partners in Boston. In 2012 McCollum married sociology Ph.D. Gretchen Sisson, in a ceremony that was described as the geekiest wedding ever.
 
Cameron S.H. Winklevoss ’04 and Tyler O.H. Winklevoss ’04 
After a four year legal dispute with Zuckerberg over the founding of Facebook, Cameron S.H. Winklevoss ’04 and Tyler O.H. Winklevoss ’04 settled their suit with Zuckerberg in 2008 for $20 million in cash and $45 million in Facebook shares, which was significantly less than their original suit of $140 million. The Winklevoss twins felt deceived by the valuation of the stocks and tried to undo the settlement. The federal appeals court in San Francisco upheld the settlement and the brothers decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court.
 
The Winklevosses continued rowing after their time at Harvard, going on to place sixth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics in pairs rowing. After graduating from Oxford with MBAs, the twins became venture capitalists, investing notably in Bitcoins and the payment processor BitInstant. Their Facebook stock is now worth an estimated $120 million.

Alden & Harlow, the restaurant that opened Friday in its location under Cafe Algiers on 40 Brattle St., pays homage to Harvard Square with its decor, its independent ownership, and even its personnel.
Featuring many of the murals that decorated the walls of its predecessor, the new bistro employs a line cook whose great uncle was the original owner of Club Casablanca, the iconic bar that occupied the space for more than 50 years.
“The name of the restaurant itself is the ultimate nod to the Square,” owner and chef Michael Scelfo said.
According to Scelfo, the architects Frank Ellis Alden and Alfred Branch Harlow designed the building the restaurant is housed in. The pair was also involved in the commission of Cambridge City Hall.
“They’re about as Cambridge an architectural firm as you can get,” Scelfo said.
Scelfo, who formerly worked as a chef for Russell House Tavern, describes the fare at Alden & Harlow as “the type of food I like to serve at home.”
“I think at its core it’s American food, which is kind of a melting pot anyway,” he said. “I think I definitely lean toward the Mediterranean in terms of what I like, having grown up in an Italian family.”
Scelfo’s restaurant serves brunch and dinner, with menu items that feature seasonal ingredients in both small plates and larger entrees. Prices range from $7 to $17 per plate.
Scelfo said wants his restaurant to cater to a wide clientele and “be everything to everybody.”
“It’s a great place for students to come in from school, hangout, and have late night snacks,” said Scelfo in reference to the kitchen’s 1 a.m. closing time.
The bar is open until 1 a.m on the weekdays and 2 a.m. on the weekends, making it  “a great place for faculty to come in and have meetings and after-work drinks,” Scelfo said.
Scelfo said one of his favorite menu items, the mesquite tortellini, exemplifies the restaurant's philosophy.
“It’s very umami based, very comforting,” Scelfo said. “I think it’s very symbolic of this place.”
Scelfo also discussed the numerous tributes his restaurant makes to Harvard Square and the city of Cambridge in general. Scelfo said he sees his restaurant as continuation of Square history.
“Alden can be that more independently owned [restaurant],” Scelfo said, adding that he wants to help create a new identity for Harvard Square that reflects its reputation as a locus of independent business.
Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, echoed this sentiment, explaining that even the restaurant’s name can be traced back to the idea of preserving history in the Square.
“Casablanca was an iconic location. For [Scelfo] to go into that location and transform it has been a lovely process to watch,” said Jillson. “He has done it with great style and respect to the original design of building.”
The restaurant has been up and running for less than a week, but according to Scelfo, the business has gotten off to a solid start.
“It’s been as good as I hoped for,” Scelfo said. “It’s very difficult to do anything perfectly, and I think restaurants are probably the most challenging thing, so I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t have a ton of things that I still wanted us to work on.”
However, Scelfo is already looking ahead to Valentine’s Day and warmer weather.
“[I’m] ready for the snow to stop and get some spring food in this place,” Scelfo said.

Second-year Harvard Law School student Rachel G. Miller-Ziegler was elected the 128th president of the Harvard Law Review on Saturday, succeeding outgoing president Gillian S. Grossman ’10.
 
Miller-Ziegler, who grew up in Sacramento, Calif., graduated from Yale College in 2010 with a degree in physics and religious studies.
 
“The Law Review is going to have a superb year under Rachel’s leadership,” Grossman said in a press release. “Rachel distinguished herself from the start through her brilliant work, her tremendous commitment to legal scholarship, and her kindness toward all on the Review.”
 
When reached by The Crimson, Grossman declined to comment.
 
Last year, the Review ramped up its online presence, more than doubling the number of editors who focus on the Review’s web content. Miller-Ziegler said she will continue this initiative.
“In the upcoming weeks, the Review will be unveiling a redesigned website with some exciting new functionality,” she wrote in an email to The Crimson.
 
The Review’s website was criticized last fall after Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain and Law School student Kendra K. Albert published a paper that found that up to 70 percent of the links on the Review’s website no longer connected to the original source of information.
 
Miller-Ziegler emphasized that the Review, which was founded by Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis in 1887, would continue to concentrate on the quality of its physical publications.
 
“My central focus will be to continue the Review’s strong tradition of publishing excellent legal scholarship,” she wrote.
 
Miller-Ziegler, who worked as a paralegal for two years before entering law school, wrote a student piece for the Review last year.
 
“Through writing a student piece for the Review, I’ve had the chance to engage in a rich dialogue with expert faculty members and my remarkably talented fellow editors, to grapple with complex and unresolved legal challenges, and to hone my writing and analytical abilities,” wrote Miller-Ziegler.
 
She also praised Grossman’s leadership.
 
“Her formidable intellect, deep personal warmth, and incomparable work ethic have made her an extraordinary and admired leader of the Review,” Miller-Ziegler said in the press release. “It is an honor to take over from someone so talented, and I look forward to working with a remarkable group of editors dedicated to the Review’s tradition of excellence in legal scholarship.”
 
On Friday and Saturday, elections will be held for the remaining officer positions for the Review’s 128th Volume.

Allston residents disagree on what to name the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, an area destined to be the retail and residential hub of Harvard’s development in Allston over the next ten years.
While many refer to the intersection as “Barry’s Corner,” the Allston Square Association, led by local landowner Reynold M. McKinney, is pushing to rename the area “Allston Square.”
According to McKinney, who has lived in Allston for 44 years, “Allston Square” more appropriately defines the location and identity of the neighborhood.
“It is about time the Metro-Boston area calls us by the name we were given hundreds of years ago in honor of Washington Allston,” McKinney said, referring to the American painter and poet after whom the neighborhood of Allston is named. Allston graduated from Harvard College in 1800.
McKinney has posted petitions around the neighborhood to record support for the name change. He said he has received almost 200 signatures. The petition is one step of the official renaming process determined by the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the Department of Transportation, McKinney said.
Other Allston residents said that changing the name of the intersection is an affront to the important history of the neighborhood.
 
“Through the generations, it’s always been Barry’s Corner to us,” longtime resident Tom Lally said, adding that the name Barry’s Corner can be found on maps that date back to the early 1900s.
Allston residents called the history of the neighborhood named Barry’s Corner one of the “tragedies of urban renewal.” During the 1960s the residents of Barry’s Corner, a tiny neighborhood in of 52 structures and 71 families, fought to remain in their homes despite the City of Boston’s decrees that the neighborhood buildings were blighted and must be demolished. Families were evicted one by one over eight years until a squadron of over 50 Boston policemen were required to remove the remaining holdouts amidst a protest of over 100 Allston residents in 1969.
According to Rita M. DiGesse, a Harvard-Allston Task Force member and resident of Allston for over eight decades, retaining the Barry’s Corner name is an important reminder of the perils of urban renewal.
“All these poor people got thrown out of their houses,” said DiGesse, who knows current Allston families who had been evicted from Barry’s Corner over four decades ago. “It shouldn’t happen again.”
Lally echoed the importance of preserving a local neighborhood name, especially in the face of Harvard’s expansion into the area.
“Washington Allston is a Harvard person,” he said, adding that the whole Allston neighborhood is named after the 19th-century painter.
The intersection will be the site of extensive Harvard development over the next decade, including a project named “The Barry’s Corner Retail and Residential Commons,” spearheaded by University-hired firm Samuels & Associates. Last April, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved the Commons, which will contain 325 housing units and 40,000 square feet of residential space. Harvard’s ten-year Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston calls for a number of other projects near the site.
Local residents said the dispute over what to name the intersection represents the tension in North Allston between a rich history and a rapidly approaching future.
“There’s a hope for a new future in that part of Allston,” Brighton resident Kevin M. Carragee said. “But I don’t think that runs counter to keeping the name.”
Despite the fact local residents have rallied around either “Barry’s Corner” or “Allston Square,”  the official name of the intersection is Anthony J. Vaccaro Square, according to a Department of Transportation spokesperson quoted in The Boston Herald.
In the end, some residents said that regardless of the official name, locals will continue calling the intersection what they have been for decades.
“Names are stubborn things,” said James Madden, project manager at an affordable housing nonprofit that operates in Allston. “Anyone who wants to call [Barry’s Corner] something else will have a tough slog at it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Voorhies, an art historian, will assume his position as the director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts today, a position he was appointed to on Jan. 31.
Previously, the responsibilities of managing the Carpenter Center were shared amongst faculty members of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies. Carrie Lambert-Beatty, a VES and history of art and architecture professor, served as interim director.
Voorhies, who is also a writer and a curator, will be responsible for developing and presenting exhibits and public programs at the Center.
“This is someone completely dedicated to imagining exhibitions, imagining what the place might be, and how the work we do here can intersect with the rest of the College,” Robb Moss, chair of the VES department, said.
The VES faculty will work closely with Voorhies as they determine what his duties as director of the Carpenter Center will entail.
“My goal is to give him as much room and support as possible to imagine what the Carpenter Center can be,” Moss said.
As well as working with the VES faculty, Voorhies will collaborate with the staff of the Harvard Art Museums and the Harvard Film Archive.
Voorhies comes to Harvard after serving as director of the Bureau for Open Culture, an itinerant curatorial initiative that he founded in 2007. As the Bureau’s director, he worked with artists and writers to create exhibitions at museums and universities.
“Throughout his career, James Voorhies has conceived of art exhibitions as fundamentally open, experimental, innovative, and collaborative sites of knowledge, production, and exchange,” Deborah M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Michael Strahan interviewed Paul Allen on the Super Bowl victor’s podium Sunday night, a Crimson sports editor stood between the NFL Hall of Famer and the Microsoft billionaire, taking in the moment.
Peter McLoughlin ’79 was not there to cover the Big Game. After all, he preferred to write about lacrosse and hockey.  He was there to accept the Vince Lombardi Trophy as president of the Seattle Seahawks.
At Harvard, McLoughlin studied English literature while writing for The Crimson’s sports board. The paper’s online archive includes 35 stories written by McLoughlin.
In a May 2012 interview with Seattle Business Magazine, McLoughlin said that his work on the paper helped him realize his desire to pursue a sports-related career:
“I was a sportswriter for The Harvard Crimson and thought, ‘I’ve got to do something in sports,’ because that’s what’s going to motivate me to get up every morning,” McLoughlin said.
Allen named McLoughlin president of the Seahawks and Major League Soccer’s Seattle Sounders in 2010. Before that, the Princeton, N.J., native had served as CEO of the National Hockey League’s St. Louis Blues and in a variety of roles with Anheuser-Busch and NBC Sports.
In 2012, McLoughlin received an expanded role in Allen’s sports holdings as CEO of Vulcan Sports & Entertainment. In addition to overseeing the business operations and administration of the Seahawks and Sounders, McLoughlin currently manages Seattle’s CenturyLink Field and Event Center and serves on the Board of Directors of the National Basketball Association’s Portland Trailblazers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For two nights in a row, Harvard men’s basketball co-captain Laurent Rivard was on fire, raining three-pointers and leading the Crimson to a weekend sweep over two Ivy foes at Lavietes Pavilion.
The 6’5” guard ended the homestand 11-of-17 from beyond the arc in triumphs over Princeton and Penn, helping Harvard (17-3, 4-0 Ivy) remain unbeaten in Ancient Eight play and maintaining its standing at the top of the conference.
“[Rivard] is that good of a jump shooter,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker after Saturday’s win. “We have known that, and that’s why we have a tremendous amount of faith and confidence in him. He has shot well this weekend.”
Rivard got started early against the Tigers on Friday night, and he ended the first half 2-of-4 from downtown.
“I started with an open look,” Rivard said. “I was wide open and I knocked the shot down, which is always fun. I missed the second one…but I felt good about it. The ones I missed weren’t really off, so I thought it was going to be a good game. I just kept going to the spots and my teammates kept finding me, so it ended up being a pretty good night.”
From then on, Rivard went 3-of-4 from beyond the arc, finishing the night with 18 points. Late in the second half, the Crimson’s all-time three-point leader knocked down a crucial three from the corner that extended Harvard’s lead to seven in the midst of a close game.
“[Junior Wesley] Saunders found me again,” Rivard said. “I had a good night shooting. That’s the type of momentum play we needed that is hurtful for the other team.”
The guard attempted only one two-point shot on the night, but didn’t connect on it. His three points that didn’t come from beyond the arc came from the free-throw line.
His dominance from downtown continued in Saturday night’s matchup against the Quakers, when Rivard recorded a season-high 22 points, leading all scorers. His six treys on the night tied his career-best.
During one 56-second stretch, Rivard knocked down three consecutive threes.Against Penn, Rivard was 6-of-9 from behind the three-point line and 4-of-5 from the charity stripe.
Overall, it was a big game from deep for Harvard. The team connected on a season-high 12 treys on the night. The Crimson did not tally a single point from inside the arc for the first 16 minutes of the second half. Its first 30 points of the period came exclusively on threes and free throws.
It was a historic night for Rivard, too. With the six makes, he moved into a tie for fourth for the most three-pointers ever scored by an Ivy League player with 253.
“He had a hell of a night,” senior forward Kyle Casey said. “He is our shooter…. They kept losing him and we kept finding him. On any given night, anyone can explode. It was definitely his night.”
This weekend marked a continuation of the senior’s success from deep this season.  So far this campaign, Rivard has made 41.8 percent of his three-pointers, along with 83.0 percent of his free throws. In Ivy League play this year, he has converted 60.9 percent of the shots he has attempted from deep. He finished the weekend averaging 20 points per game and shot 64.7 percent, and his prowess from beyond the arc propelled the squad to two crucial conference victories.
Harvard sits at 4-0 in Ivy play on the season, one game ahead of Brown and Yale. Both teams will visit Lavietes this upcoming weekend.
Rivard will most likely be counted upon to come through in clutch situations as the Crimson heads into the meat of its conference schedule.
“Rivard [recognizes] the significance of a Saturday night game in our conference and knows how important that can be, home or away,” Amaker said.
After his performance this weekend, there is little doubt that Rivard will be trusted to make the calls on his shots when he has an opportunity to convert.  “He has a green light,” Amaker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With both Harvard and Northeastern looking to end lengthy Beanpot championship droughts—21 and 26 years, respectively—the two squads faced off on Monday evening at TD Garden in the first round of the 62nd edition of the annual tournament.
Leaving little suspense throughout, the No. 11 Huskies dominated the contest, as Northeastern (16-8-3, 8-5-1 Hockey East) blanked the Crimson, 6-0, to reach the Beanpot final for the third time in four years.
Husky goaltender Clay Witt, who leads the nation in save percentage, collected his fourth shutout of the season.
“Quite frankly, we lost battles all over the ice,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We didn’t execute, we didn’t play well, [and] we certainly didn’t coach well.”
“All in all, it was just very disappointing,” Donato added.
After falling behind, 2-0, early in the first period, Harvard (6-12-3, 3-9-3 ECAC) looked to turn the corner following a game misconduct penalty on Northeastern’s Josh Manson. But the Crimson could not take advantage of this five-minute man-advantage, failing to generate much offense throughout the entire penalty.
“We got the five-minute mark and…that was our chance to get a goal and get back in the game,” Donato said. “We didn’t play very well to that point, but we had a chance to cut the lead in half and to maybe get in the locker room, regroup a little bit, and turn it into a hockey game.”
The Huskies may have had to wait until after intermission to use the momentum from the extended penalty kill, but they wasted no time in the second period, scoring just 31 seconds into the frame on a Torin Snydeman goal.
Northeastern added three more scores the rest of the way, including two power-play goals, the final one coming on a man-advantage opportunity from a major penalty called on Harvard freshman Kevin Guiltinan in the final minutes of the contest.
The entire game was peppered with penalties, with the Huskies committing 15 and Harvard 16, while serving 41 and 35 minutes in the box, respectively. The Crimson also took itself out of power plays several times with penalties early in the man-advantage opportunity.
“We really shot ourselves in the foot,” Donato said. “I think we were never really able to get any flow in the game and establish any forecheck.”
Northeastern was able to jump out to an early lead after strong control of the puck for the first six minutes of the game. At 5:57, Husky Dalen Hedges skated around the right circle with the puck, firing it past senior goaltender Raphael Girard’s glove for his eighth goal of the season.
After each team committed three penalties apiece in the first 10 minutes of the game, Harvard found itself down two skaters after consecutive penalties on junior defenseman Max Everson and Guiltinan. Northeastern immediately capitalized on this five-on-three advantage, with sophomore Kevin Roy receiving the puck in the center of the offensive zone, passing it to John Stevens, who then passed it right back to Roy for the one-touch goal. After Snydeman’s goal early in the second, Braden Pimm scored soon thereafter at 4:22, putting it past Girard on a four-on-three man-advantage for the Huskies to make it 4-0 in favor of Northeastern.
Though the Crimson led the second period in shots, 13-10, the Huskies essentially put the game out of reach just 16 seconds into the third period, as Colton Saucerman fired a low hard shot from the center of the blue line. Mike Szmatula capped off the scoring for Northeastern with a power-play goal with 3:13 left in the game.
Junior Patrick McNally and freshman Sean Malone led Harvard in shots on goal with four each but, like the rest of the team, could not find the back of the net.
With the defeat, Harvard will face off next Monday against the loser of the BU-BC matchup in the first round nightcap. The game will mark the Crimson’s sixth straight consolation game since falling to BC in the 2008 final.
The loss means that seniors like captain Dan Ford will end their Harvard careers without reaching a Beanpot final.
“It hurts,” Ford said. "It’s going to be tough to watch the late game next week, and I really would’ve liked to have been part of a championship game. But we still have a lot to play for. We are going to try to move forward here and focus on what we can do during the last month [of the season].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team added two more tallies to the win column this weekend, notching victories over Ivy League foes Columbia and Cornell.
A week after sitting its top four players and coming away with a perfect 9-0 victory over St. Lawrence, the No. 1 Crimson (9-0, 5-0 Ivy) returned with a full lineup and came out on top to stay undefeated in both nonconference and Ancient Eight play.
Harvard took commanding victories in both matches, topping the Lions (6-4, 1-4) by a score of 9-0 on Sunday and beating the No. 6 Big Red (7-3, 3-2) in an 8-1 decision on Saturday. With wins over Princeton and second place Penn already under its belt, the Crimson is the frontrunner for the 2014 Ivy title.
“The Ivy title is always in the back of our minds when we’re playing Ivy League opponents,” junior co-captain Haley Mendez said. “We felt a little bit more comfortable going into the Cornell-Columbia matches, so now we’re really looking towards this coming Friday match against Yale, which will probably be the decider for the Ivy title.”
HARVARD 9, COLUMBIA 0
Harvard proved it deserved its No. 1 ranking on Sunday, as the team breezed to a 9-0 rout of No. 9 Columbia.
“It was definitely a very strong weekend all around,” co-captain Natasha Anzik said. “We had a lot of girls who didn’t play as well on Saturday [make] some adjustments, and everything sort of came together on Sunday.”
The Crimson swept positions one through six, as all Harvard players won their matches by 3-0 decisions. Junior Amanda Sobhy retained her unblemished record at the top position with a victory over Colette Sultana, 11-5, 11-5, 11-1, and Mendez replicated the feat at the second position with an 11-5, 11-5, 11-5 win over Grace Van Arkel.
Junior Julianne Chu also had an important victory at the sixth position, as she topped Leah Barnet, 11-5, 11-5, 11-7, to earn her second conference triumph of the weekend.
“Megan Murray and Julianne Chu had big wins this weekend in the nine and six positions,” Mendez said. “They’ve had some tough matches over January, so it was nice to see them come up strong and get two Ivy League wins under their belts. It gives the team confidence going into this week.”
Harvard’s only dropped game came in the seventh position, where freshman Dileas McGowan lost the first set, 11-9, to Columbia’s Alisha Maityo. But McGowan came back strong, and won the next three sets by scores of 11-4, 11-4, 11-4 to take the match.
HARVARD 8, CORNELL 1
Harvard earned its first win of the weekend on Saturday, notching an 8-1 decision over Cornell.
“Everyone just played really solidly,” Anzik said. “By the end [they] were playing really great squash. I’m really proud of everyone.”
Harvard’s only match loss was at the eighth position, where sophomore Isabelle Dowling was bested by Olivia Wherry in five games. Sobhy returned to the lineup a week after making it to the semifinals of the 2014 Harrow Greenwich Open, where she fell to New Zealand’s Joelle King, the world’s fifth-ranked women’s player. On Saturday, Sobhy posted scores of 11-9, 11-3, 11-1 to cruise to a 3-0 win over Cornell’s Danielle Letorneau
.Mendez and freshman Katie Tutrone also beat their opponents by 3-0 scores to give Harvard the sweep at the first three positions. The Crimson’s other three-game victories came in the sixth and ninth spots, as Chu and Murray notched 3-0 wins over their respective opponents. A week after coming out on top at the first position, sophomore Michelle Gemmell returned to the fifth position and posted a 3-1 victory.
The Crimson now looks to Tuesday’s matchup against No. 2 Trinity, which will be a rematch of last year’s Howe Cup finals, in its quest to stay perfect on the season.
“Trinity’s a really big match for us,” Anzik said. “They’re undefeated as well, and I think going in on paper we might be considered the underdog. We’re going to use that to our advantage, and not put too much pressure on ourselves. What we’re emphasizing is just staying the same: taking the momentum from the weekend and going up there and playing the best we can.”

Editor's Note: This post, which was originally published in Oct. 2010, is being republished on the occasion of the tenth anniversay of Facebook's founding. 
It goes without saying, but during his time at Harvard, Mark E. Zuckerberg wasn’t just another student. While he was here and even after dropping out, he was regularly featured in The Crimson.
To take get a sense of his life here at Harvard, we compiled a list of Crimson articles that chronicled his ventures.

Good morning, Harvard! It’s only Tuesday, but in case your brain is already dead, here’s some intellectual stimulation!
 Choose the more annoying between the pairs:
Yesterday’s snow pelting you in the face while you walked to class vs. The fact that you have four more days until Friday.
That regrettable decision you made last night to watch a Netflix documentary instead of doing your reading vs. The sludge on your room floor from all of your roommates’ snow boots.
The brief but excruciatingly cold moment you have when you come out of the shower during the winter vs. Your conflicting desires to want a Valentine’s Day date but also to become a social recluse and hide under your covers watching re-runs of “The Office” for the rest of the winter.
When you want to message your friend during lecture but you don’t want the person behind you reading your conversation and judging you vs. The fact that all your goals for second semester have already dissipated.
(Answer: all of the pairs above are equal in terms of annoyance)
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Time to cross our fingers for a snow day sometime this week! With a high of 32 degrees, the day is mostly sunny while there’s a 100 percent chance of snow at night. Combined with more snow expected tomorrow, all we want to do is wear fuzzy socks and drink hot chocolate.
 IN THE D-HALLS
Lunch:Grilled Citrus ChickenPork Spetsofai (HUDS is on a roll with the special Greek dishes!)Falafel Sandwich
Dinner:Lemon Pepper TilapiaPumpkin Gnocchi with SageIt’s also Cupcake Night! You know you want one to get you through the prospects of facing Wednesday.
EVENTS
Although the Harvard Men’s Hockey team fell to Northeastern yesterday in a crushing 6-0 defeat, maybe the Women’s Hockey team can make up for it. Head over to Boston College at 5 p.m. to show them some love.
Aspiring politician? Don’t lie, we know at least half of you have thought about it. And by thought about it, we mean that you’ve probably spent hours in front of the mirror practicing your stump speech. You’re in good company. The Institute of Politics is hosting an open house in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum from 6-7:30 p.m. Stop by to learn about all thirteen of their programs, and meet the six fellows who’ll be hanging around the Kennedy School this semester.
AND FINALLY…
A couple things to check out if you have some free (also known as procrastinating) time:
By now, you’ve probably heard about the Harvard riff on Humans of New York that’s been making us all laugh, cry, feel all fuzzy inside, and maybe even wish were fuzzy on the outside, too. That’s right, Squirrels of Harvard has taken this campus by storm, and we’re sure it won’t be long before the hardcover edition of the posts from the Facebook page shows up at the Coop. Maybe Dean Pfister can pitch in with his own edition—Botany of Harvard? Herbaria of Harvard? Mystery Novels of Harvard? We aren’t picky.

We’re back! We at Flyby are sure that you, like us, enjoyed a relaxing break catching up with family and friends. We're glad to be back, but we could do without those dulling "How was your break?" and "How was shopping week?" conversations. To help you all get back in the swing of talking to other students, here's a list of guaranteed, successful conversation starters:
 "Did you hear that [insert name of good mutual friend] is taking a semester off? I haven’t seen him or her once yet.”Make sure the person isn’t actually taking a semester off. Just for fun.
"Is it true that Dean Pfister is going to fight for the permanent deanship?"While we share heaps of Flyby love for Dean Rakesh Khurana, we're going to miss all the botanical and whimsical emails. Who knows? Maybe if you start the rumor it will reach him and the two can duke it out for our affection.
"You look good, break treated you really well."The less well you know the person, the better.
"We need to talk."Pick your tone carefully and watch your conversational partner get super uncomfortable. Does it sound like "need" is in italics (e.g. We neeeeeeeed to talk more this semester)? If so, laugh internally while they try to figure out when you got so damn emotional. Is it deadpan and ominous? Freak them out a little!
"Want to block with me?"Say this to a stranger or someone you don’t like.
"You look familiar? Did you go to (your high school)? Class of (a year or two before you)?”To Professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53, age 72.
"Sie sind ziemlich heiß. Treffen Sie mich in der Bibliothek Stacks später?"If you say this to a German person, don’t tell them my name. And don’t be mad if they slap you.
