After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anthropologie, the high-end women’s clothing and furniture store, will move into the iconic glass-paned premises at 48 Brattle St. this fall.
Well-known for its distinctive decorations and artful window-scapes, Anthropologie caught the attention of building owner William J. Poorvu when he overheard a female assistant mention last fall that the chain would be “terrific for that space.”
“Who’s Anthropologie?” Poorvu, the managing partner of the Brattle Square Office Building Company, recalled asking his daughter-in-law that evening.
Upon visiting several Anthropologie stores in New York and Boston over the next few months, Poorvu said he determined that the chain deftly utilized multiple-level spaces and showcased a keen visual sense of interior design.
“They really cared about what would be shown there,” Poorvu said.
He ultimately decided that Anthropologie would be the best fit for the empty space on Brattle St., which had been vacated by Crate & Barrel in January 2009. Poorvu commenced the final approval process during the winter months.
“We’re delighted and looking forward to the grand opening and...to having that building lit with beautiful colors and beautiful displays that really lend such excitement and vibrancy to that end of Brattle St.,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
Anthropologie will be joining its sister retail brand in Harvard Square. The popular store Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie are both run by Urban Outfitters, Inc.

Former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings, former Haiti Prime Minister Michèle      Pierre-Louis, and former Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer are among the six resident fellows who will be joining the Institute of Politics this fall, the IOP announced today.
The roster—which showcases a diverse set of backgrounds ranging from journalism to foreign politics—also includes Israel's former Minister of Interior Ophir Pines-Paz, Boston Globe reporter Susan Milligan, and former Miami, Florida chief of police John Timoney.
"Inspiring interactions with top public sector leaders is a key reason student engagement in the field continues to grow,” outgoing IOP Director Bill Purcell is quoted in the press release. "This Fellows class is an ideal group of leaders who can help turn interest in public service into a career and commitment to making a difference."
Purcell said that in recent years, students have expressed "strong interest" in opportunities abroad—making this particular group of IOP fall fellows "especially strong and timely."
Two career politicians and a political reporter will bring extensive international experience to the Fellows program. Pierre-Louis, who served as the Prime Minister of Haiti from 2008 to 2009, was the second female to hold the post in the country's history. Pines-Paz similarly brings international experience, armed with a résumé that includes positions as the Minister of the Interior and Minister of Science, Culture, and Sport in Israel.
Milligan, a national political reporter for The Globe, said she views the IOP fellowship as an opportunity to provide students a perspective different from that of a politician.
"I've reported overseas and have a real sense of how foreign countries operate,” Milligan said. "I’m so excited for this opportunity."
Archer, former president of the American Bar Association, will bring a more local perspective on politics, along with Timoney, a police officer with 40 years of experience. Timoney said he hopes to inform students about the political aspects of police work by describing the "nuances and angles where police can be very good or sometimes very bad."
Purcell said that Spellings, the former Secretary of Education, will not only bring "a life of public service" to Harvard, but her knowledge of education—"one of the most important and timely issues facing our nation."

Juan Manuel Santos, who graduated from Harvard Kennedy School in 1981 and served as a Nieman Fellow at the University, was elected president of Colombia on Sunday and will take office in mid-July.
Santos defeated Antanas Mockus—the mayor of Bogotá, Colombia—by garnering 69 percent of the votes to his opponent’s 27.5 percent, marking the biggest margin in the country’s history.
In his recent years as Minister of Defense under outgoing Colombia President Álvaro Uribe, Santos played an active role in addressing the Marxist guerrillas that plagued the country.
Santo’s civic and political roles in his native country include redirecting upward the direction of the Colombian economy when he was in charge of the Colombian finance portfolio in 2000, and serving as the chief executive of the Colombian Coffee Delegation to the International Coffee Organization.
Beyond his political contributions to Colombia, Santos serves as sub-director of his family-owned newspaper El Tiempo, which boasts the largest circulation in the country, and had spent a year in the late 1980s as a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.
“He had a little more going on than the rest of us did,” said John S. MacCormack, a then-Nieman fellow and currently a reporter for the San Antonio Express-News. “He seemed older and more sophisticated...The rest of us were simple journalists working about.”
Eugene Robinson, who was also a Nieman fellow at the time, said that he was not surprised that Santos—a long-time friend and a “brilliant,” “extremely gracious” man—had been elected president of Colombia.
“One thing that any bureaucratic official faces is not having enough information—not having the right information,” said Robinson, now an associate editor at The Washington Post. “I think that as a journalist at heart...Juan Manuel has the instinct to really dig and find out what’s really going on.”
Santos—who has a degree in law and diplomacy and also received multiple degrees from the London School of Economics—helped execute the raids against guerrillas and drug traffickers, exemplifying his devotion to civil service that helped pave his rise to the presidency.
Santos now faces the problems of a bankrupt public health system and high unemployment as he moves into office.
“He has all the personal skills he needs plus a strong majority in Congress,” said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Kennedy School’s Center for International Development, who met Santos in 1992. “Things look good for Colombia.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the 2010 NBA draft just hours away, Harvard’s Jeremy Lin is still trying to prove that he deserves to be one of 60 names called by NBA Commissioner David Stern tonight at Madison Square Garden.
Lin travelled to Toronto’s Air Canada Centre Tuesday morning to participate in a pre-draft workout for the NBA’s Raptors, who hold the 13th overall pick in the upcoming draft.
Lin drilled alongside five other NBA hopefuls, including fellow guard Edgar Sosa of Louisville.
Looking to increase his exposure with NBA scouts after playing relatively under the radar in the Ivy League, Lin has participated in a handful of workouts against some of the top prospects at his position in front of NBA teams since his final season with the Crimson ended.
On top of yesterday’s workout with the Raptors, Lin has visited the New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs.
In these workouts, Lin has matched up with the likes of projected first round picks Greivis Vasquez, Jordan Crawford, and Greg Monroe.
But according to draft expert Ryan Feldman—editor of the Hoops Report—Lin’s performance at the workouts has not helped his stock, and Feldman projects Lin to go undrafted.
“I don’t think he’s done anything that’s overwhelmed teams,” Feldman said. “He’s a solid point guard from a mid-major conference. There are other guys teams would rather take a chance on.”
But Lin will wait to see if his name is called tonight.
“It’s hard to tell what everyone’s thinking,” said Lin, who declined to share his draft-night plans, though he admits to having something in the works. “You never know what’s going to happen on draft night with what everyone’s thinking.”
In all likelihood, tonight’s draft will be a disappointment for the former Harvard co-captain, who finished his career as the only player in Ivy League history to amass 1,450 points, 450 rebounds, 400 assists, and 200 steals.
“Certainly anybody at this caliber who does well since the season ended has a chance to slip into the last few picks, but the chances aren’t very high,” Feldman said. “[What hurts him] are just things that the NBA always looks at: size, athleticism, and potential. He’s a senior, which shouldn’t hurt him, but it does. It’s not that he’s totally lacking athleticism, but he’s not super athletic. He just doesn’t have things that overwhelm teams.”
ESPN’s Chad Ford has a slightly more positive outlook on Lin’s chances.
“I wrote last week that I didn’t think Lin was ready for the NBA, and I expected him to go undrafted after a workout I saw in Vegas,” Ford wrote on ESPN.com in May. “However, several team have since told me that they are considering Lin with their second-round pick.”
But regardless of what happens tonight, Lin’s NBA fate will not have been sealed.
“I know that if I don’t get drafted, I’ll still be playing summer league somewhere,” Lin said.
The 2010 NBA Summer League, which features 22 NBA teams, begins July 9 and regularly provides an opportunity for undrafted players to show off their skills in hopes of getting signed.
“I’m pretty sure that he’ll make a summer league roster if he wants to,” Feldman said. “There’s a lot of competition in that so it’s really tough to make a team.”
For Lin, the transition from workouts to summer league competitions will be a welcome one.
“I am excited for when I get to play five-on-five, because I feel like that’s my strength,” Lin said.
