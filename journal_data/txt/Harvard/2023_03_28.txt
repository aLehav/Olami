NASCAR’s claim on the American public has officially come under threat. Ten years ago, Formula 1 and NASCAR were more than 5.5 million viewers apart. But in 2022, the Miami Grand Prix and the Darlington Raceway NASCAR race, held the same weekend, both racked up an average of 2.6 million viewers — the first time a Formula 1 event has ever matched NASCAR numbers. This begs the question: Is it really possible that Formula 1 will overtake NASCAR to become America’s new favorite motorsport? With NASCAR’s slow death among its core fanbase and Formula One’s rapid expansion to the fresh American market, the answer to that question may be a resounding yes.
Outside the U.S., Formula One is undeniably more popular than NASCAR. In the 2022 season, NASCAR averaged over three million viewers per race, the most they’ve had in four years. Meanwhile, the 2021 Formula 1 season saw an average of 70 million viewers per race. Despite the current chasm in the two’s popularities, the sports had similar beginnings. The NASCAR Cup Series began in 1949 with nine races, and Formula 1 had its first championship season a year later in 1950 with eight races. Still, each sport had a slightly different approach from the start.
NASCAR quickly barreled towards being the quintessential American sport. Within three years, it grew to holding 37 races, competed by rural, working-class men like Lee Petty and Ralph Earnhardt with cars that the American consumer could buy. Today, the core principles remain: The cars are tough, the drivers are tough, and the racing is tough. Short of intentionally wrecking another competitor, there’s not much that you can’t do. This, paired with NASCAR’s origins being intertwined with Prohibition-era moonshine runners, gave rise to its original fanbase: mostly rural, southern men. Nowadays, one of the biggest criticisms of NASCAR is its supposed alienation of that core fanbase. By attempting to broaden its appeal, NASCAR seems to have lost its most consistent supporters.
Formula 1, meanwhile, has always prided itself on its elegance — even calling themselves “the pinnacle of motorsport.” Teams spend upwards of $100 million — with some teams putting down as much as $400 million before a cap was introduced — per season designing and building cars at the forefront of engineering, racing around the globe in something adjacent to a traveling circus. While Formula 1 will never be as rugged a sport as NASCAR, NASCAR can’t compete with the international prestige that Formula 1 offers.
Furthermore, unlike NASCAR, Formula 1’s attempt at broadening appeal has been wildly successful. Since a takeover by Liberty Media in 2018, Formula 1 viewership has been growing rapidly in the United States — between 2018 and 2022 average viewership grew from just over 500 thousand to around 1.4 million. Social media revamps, young drivers connecting with their fans in new ways, and — maybe most importantly — the Netflix docuseries “Drive to Survive” have all helped boost Formula 1’s U.S. popularity. In fact, according to Formula 1, season 4 of “Drive to Survive” was the most watched show on Netflix in 33 countries, including the U.S. The New York Times even reported from an on-site survey that more than one-third of attendees at last year’s Austin Grand Prix mentioned the show as a reason for their attendance.
With NASCAR’s steady decline in viewership since 2005 and Formula 1’s recent meteoric rise, the time seems ripe for a lead change in America’s top motorsport. To most Americans, NASCAR has always belonged to the “rednecks” —an association strong enough that NASCAR’s attempts to broaden their viewership are not only pointless, but discourage the dedicated fans they do have. Perhaps younger Americans are ready to shift away from the patriotic, everyman atmosphere that accompanies NASCAR.
Formula 1, on the other hand, represents a new sport for American fans to indulge in — one characterized by global fame, high stakes, and an array of celebrity drivers to fawn over (scroll through Charles Leclerc’s Instagram to understand why). This new appeal is something NASCAR simply cannot match and, in a few years’ time, it’ll pay the price.
Does this mean Formula 1 is objectively a better racing series than NASCAR? Not necessarily, but one thing is for certain: as the younger generations take to the road, Formula 1’s global appeal certainly has the power to kick NASCAR to the curb on America’s motorsport podium.

At seemingly the peak of his career, Lawrence “Law” Roach announced his sudden retirement from celebrity styling, leaving fans and clients stunned. Roach is one of the most renowned stylists in Hollywood and a trailblazer in the fashion industry, having styled some of the most iconic looks on the biggest names in entertainment, including Zendaya, Celine Dion, Ariana Grande, Bella Hadid, and Anna Taylor-Joy.
Roach’s rise to fame has been impressive, having started his career as a vintage clothing dealer in Chicago and entering the world of celebrity styling in the early 2010s. Always challenging conventional beauty standards and gender norms, he is known for bold and innovative styles that blend high fashion with aspects of streetwear and vintage looks.
Over the years, Roach has also used his platform to speak about his experiences as a Black stylist in a predominantly white industry and promote designers of color given his position as a passionate advocate for diversity within the fashion industry.
In recent years, Roach has appeared as a judge for America’s Next Top Model and won the first ever CFDA stylist award.
With all of this under his belt, Roach shocked fans with a since-deleted Instagram post announcing his retirement from celebrity styling — just two days after styling Hunter Schafer, Kerry Washington, Hailee Steinfeld, Eve Jobs, and Megan Thee Stallion for the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty.
“If this business was just about the clothes I would do it for the rest of my life but unfortunately it’s not! The politics, the lies and false narratives finally got me! You win…I’m out,” read the caption of the Instagram post.
In an interview with The Cut following the announcement, Roach confirmed his retirement and explained his reason for the sudden move. He shared that the pressure and drama within his career had taken too much of a toll on his happiness.
“The culmination of everything that’s been happening in my career for these last few days kind of just pushed me over the edge,” he said, referring to the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.
During the interview, Roach alluded to a call with a client he dressed for the Vanity Fair Oscar party as the last straw that led to his retirement from celebrity styling. Fans were left to speculate which of his many celebrity clients that night could have been the final straw.
Roach’s decision has set him free to focus on himself and his other endeavors. Though he has stepped back from celebrity styling, he remains a powerful force in the fashion industry.
During his interview with The Cut, he asked, “Isn’t it always best to leave when you’re on the top?”

“Once upon a time.” With those four words, Narrator (David Patrick Kelly) of “Into the Woods” launches the audience into a well-known story. Directed by Lear Debessonet, with music direction by Rob Berman and choreography by Lorin Latarro, the national tour of “Into the Woods” on Broadway opened at the Emerson Colonial Theatre on March 21. A masterful take on the beloved Sondheim musical, the award-winning revival manages to make the show — which premiered on Broadway in 1987 — still seem fresh.
“Into the Woods,” a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by James Lapine, follows an ensemble cast of characters from different fairy tales as they journey into the woods, each hoping to fulfill their wish. The show has been revived multiple times, most recently in 2022, with a production that began at New York City Center and transferred to Broadway for a six-week run at the St. James Theatre, which ultimately became a six-month run after multiple extensions due to incredible popularity. The revival is now on tour, with several actors reprising their roles from Broadway.
While some revivals extensively rework the shows they’re based on (such as the recent Broadway production of “Oklahoma!”), the new “Into the Woods” is more of a restaging than a full reinterpretation. Without many changes from the original musical, the show delivers exactly what theatergoers anticipated — the original brilliantly written book and score interpreted by some of the most seasoned artists in the industry.
The entire cast is excellent, each actor bringing a fresh and sincere take on their role. Montego Glover (“Witch”) and Stephanie J. Block (“Baker’s Wife”) are standouts in their respective roles. Glover exudes presence every time she steps onstage; she revels in her villainous power, yet her conflicting goals and human desires still show through. Block, a well-known performer in the theater industry, shines both on her own and alongside her real-life husband Sebastian Arcelus, who plays the Baker. They inhabit their roles with an infectious chemistry, particularly in the upbeat duet “It Takes Two.” And Gavin Creel’s charisma is off the charts in his dual role of Cinderella’s Prince and the Wolf.
The show’s minimalist set, designed by David Rockwell, works well to draw the audience’s full attention to the cast’s acting performances. Each scene is accompanied only by three houses suspended over the actors’ heads, or a scattering of organ-like trees, to indicate whether the scene takes place in the town or in the woods. The costumes, designed by Andrea Hood, are similarly minimalist, bringing a modern flavor to the fairytale of “Into the Woods” — the Witch, for example, wears a sequined, purple, spaghetti-strap dress throughout the second act. Given the sleek simplicity of the production as a whole, it works.
The show chooses to forgo elaborate sets in favor of visually highlighting the people that make up its cast, orchestra, and crew. Several moving elements of the show, such as flocks of birds, are operated by onstage puppeteers Kennedy Kanagawa and Josh Breckenridge. Rather than just playing a voiceover or reciting lines from offstage, actress Felicia Curry intones the Giant’s booming lines from a microphone stand at the back of the stage. The orchestra, too, is onstage for the entire show instead of playing from a pit, emphasizing the fact that the conductor and musicians are just as integral to the show as the actors.
The show, which takes a somewhat dark turn during the second act, does well to balance levity and solemnity. Parts of the show, particularly Creel’s scenes alongside Rapunzel’s Prince (Jason Forbach), were riotously funny; other parts, such as the conga line of deaths that occur throughout the second act, brought a much needed seriousness and weight to the show. The result is a musical that effortlessly shifts between humor and tears, anger and tenderness. All of this is supported by Sondheim’s superb score, which still sounds fresh and innovative after 36 years — a testament to the longevity of his work.
“Careful the tale you tell; that is the spell,” the Witch sings in the finale. The tale that “Into the Woods” tells is an utter delight — a three-hour enchantment that will leave the audience feeling as if they’ve woken up from a particularly wondrous spell.
“Into the Woods” runs through April 2 at the Emerson Colonial Theatre.

Celebrated novelist Zadie Smith’s debut play, “The Wife of Willesden,” has made its way across the pond for its North American premiere at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.). A contemporary adaptation of Geoffrey Chaucer’s “The Wife of Bath’s Tale” — one of the best-known selections from “The Canterbury Tales” — the play is set in a West London pub and narrated by a woman named Alvita, locally known as the titular Wife of Willesden.
Director Indhu Rubasingham — who also spearheaded the play’s debut run at London’s Kiln Theatre — creates a production that very much dedicates itself to conveying Smith’s words. Alvita, portrayed excellently by actress Clare Perkins, is largely responsible for ensuring that Rubasingham’s vision comes to fruition; she remains remarkably attentive throughout the play, maintaining deep engagement with the audience that partly justifies the director’s choice not to develop many other elements of the show.
Smith aimed to translate Chaucer’s stories for a contemporary audience, in celebration of Brent, her native London borough, named “London Borough of Culture 2020.” As an act of translation, the play is spectacularly successful. Underneath its 21st-century flourishes, Smith’s adaptation remains true to Chaucer’s original, pioneering literary form — winding, epic tales of far-flung people and places recounted in ways that can even feel unfamiliar to a modern audience.
The play’s content also delivers on its promise of modernity. Like “The Wife of Bath’s Tale,” the prologue is longer than the tale itself, and most of the 95-minute running time is dedicated to Alvita walking the audience and her fellow bar patrons through her decidedly epic marital history. Each marriage story is interspersed with more tumultuous myths of criminal acts and unlikely triumphs that come together to paint the picture of her, a woman as locally famous as she is infamous.
Beyond its position as a Chaucer adaptation, the show isn’t as innovative as one might expect. Much of Alvita’s monologue is made up of commentary on heteronormative marital woes and the everlasting battle of the sexes that will not bring any new perspective to most viewers — though some still may find it to be cathartic — and the downside of the epic poetic format is that the piece sometimes lingers far too long on tired literary tropes.
What may be surprising to some audiences is the brashness with which Alvita speaks about these issues. She is confident, outspoken, and proud — traits that remain underwritten for women characters, particularly women of color. She is an unlikely figure to be seen championing feminist causes, doing so in a way that manages to strike a balance between lightheartedness and sincerity.
Due to this focus on Alvita and her lines, other aspects of the production suffer. When the show drew focus toward supporting characters, the actors displayed excellent artistic intuition and great enthusiasm — but these moments were scarce and brief, leaving audiences disappointed when those characters’ time in the spotlight was over. The design consists of two ornate, homely bars that are shockingly underutilized, making it impossible for their elegance and intricacies to resonate with the audience. Very little dialogue happens at the bar itself, with Alvita instead taking center stage. This choice, combined with the very little attention paid to the supporting characters, removed the audience from the show’s pub setting and instead led to a sense that Alvita was simply monologuing from the A.R.T. stage.
Overall, the show accomplishes what it most sets out to do: Provide a contemporary Chaucer tale and celebrate the people and culture of Brent. Both are done well, and Smith absolutely does her due diligence in staying true to the source text, down to writing her adaptation’s dialogue in verse couplet. Alvita’s words are mostly successful at shouldering the weight of the production entirely on their own, a feat that likely would not have been possible without the support of both Perkins and Rubasingham. That said, the show yearns for something more; additional development of the supporting characters, a take on the institution of marriage that hasn’t already been heard the world over, or more visual stimuli, perhaps. Of course, enhancing each of those elements comes with the price of weakening the faithfulness of the adaptation; given these constraints, Smith’s creativity and literary prowess are untouchable. As a complete play, it may have benefited from a more robust set of creative expertise.

As the sounds of Drake’s “Hotline Bling” and Doja Cat's “Cyber Sex” fill the Roberts Studio Theatre at the The Calderwood Pavilion before SpeakEasy Stage Company’s production of “Wild Goose Dreams,” it’s hard to imagine how these songs could relate to a play about North Korea. But in the hands of playwright Hansol Jung and with the direction of Seonjae Kim, the seemingly contrasting elements come together seamlessly. “Wild Goose Dreams” weaves together serious themes of isolation, family, and digital communication with moments of levity at a break-neck pace. This tonal whiplash illuminates a side of North Korea that is rarely seen in the mainstream and highlights the joy and humor of a protagonist who reflects the complexities of her home country.
“Wild Goose Dreams” follows a young woman and recent North Korean defector, Nanhee, and Minsung, a lonely “goose father” who works at Samsung to provide for his wife and teenage daughter while they live in America. Nanhee is haunted by her past and struggling to adapt to her new life in the South, and Minsung has difficulty connecting with his wife and daughter whose lives are far removed from his in South Korea. Both Minsung and Nanhee feel the isolation that their far away families create and this loneliness leads them to strike up an unlikely connection that begins online.
The online space is a difficult terrain to depict on stage without coming across as overbearing or ostentatious. “Wild Goose Dreams” faces the challenge by representing a chorus of online noise with a group of actors talking over each other, announcing headlines, and advertising dating apps in loud clothing and louder voices that combine to create a mobile maelstrom. The online chorus is nauseating enough to make anyone want to unplug, accurately depicting the chatter and restlessness that Minsung and Nanhee feel in their otherwise quiet lives.
“Wild Goose Dreams” takes place in various indoor spaces, and differences in setting are demarcated in a simple way — chorus members move gauzy neon frames to separate rooms. Set designer Crystal Tiala’s fabric sculptures are visually intriguing even if, at times, their rearrangement by actors during scenes is unnecessary and somewhat distracting. However, these walls of translucent colorful fabric on top of the signs for different storefronts adds to the feeling that the characters are tightly packed yet isolated, and the motion of their surroundings reflects the transient quality of Nanhee’s and Minsung’s current situations. In addition to the vibrant sets, sound designer George Cooke’s naturalistic effects add to the atmosphere, though a few uses are abrupt and prevent the emotional resonance of scenes to sit. Supervised by Dominique D. Burford, a variety of penguin props are used to depict Nanhee’s nightmares, and their arts-and-crafts appearance bring fun and absurdity to these darker moments.
The frenzied moments that occupy much of the first half of “Wild Goose Dreams” are countered by quieter, longer scenes that take place at night between the lead characters. Actors Eunji Lim (Yoo Nanhee) and Jeffrey Song (Guk Minsung) display great candidness and delicacy in these tender moments between their characters, which helps the audience root for their unordinary pairing. Other standout performances include the ebullient Amanda Centeno, who plays Heejin, Minsung’s loud and precocious daughter, and Fady Demian as the stoic and charismatic digital Minsung.
The core of “Wild Goose Dreams”’s story could have been easily lost in the whirlwind of the graphic moving sets, the online avatars popping in and out without subtlety, and the several representations of penguins. However, the story remains grounded, which is a testament to the strength of Hansol Jung’s writing, director Seonjae Kim’s ability to wrangle such an expansive plot, and the cast's dedication to the heart of this play. Although “Wild Goose Dreams” takes place in the South, its depiction of a connection between South Korean Minsung and North Korean defector Nanhee highlights the multitude of emotions that North Koreans experience beyond oppression and pain. As Nanhee says in a particularly affecting scene, North Koreans know how to fall in love, too.

Gatsby
To see dawn’s red face, angry against a brooding
horizon. Your dowdy eyes, your tears: pearly,
lactic. Two fingers pressed to the roof
of your mouth, the prickle and the purge. I slice
oranges one after the other and barely glean
the juice from each half. Blade and butcher’s block, carrot fingers.
To cut the kitchen knife like the rest of them.
And I, I tell you—the panic like static, white noise
filling the jester’s box in my collarbone. The parking lot
outside the stir-fry joint where I cried thinking of nooses
and my friends fought fifteen feet away about their breaking
relationship. I’ve seen love shatter before it was built (a tale fed to me
like milk). I’ve seen the credits of the ballet roll and not worked up
a single tear. The terminally ill patient and the dying dog.
Double-o-seven. And I’ll cuff you over the ear, if you give me
a shot. Stand within range. Put down the niceties
and metric-measured tonalities and say it:
I never loved you. How could I?
51mm
I.
In the night the dog’s run turns violent. Knife-
clang, too close to my throat. Light wedging in
with a dull ache, pressure on a bruise. I pant
and I can hear it. I hurt and and I can see it, the wound
eating me up, corroded, wadded and thrown away.
Oh, to be away. The only place to breathe
and yet where is air?
II.
Time fades in again, slowly and with
hesitation. A bird learns how to beat wings
in early hours. I do not message you.
My hands, clumsy and sure like a toddler,
grasping refrigerator magnets.
Dog, mailman, shovel, ladybug. Garden
outside. Cool kitchen air. Lemonade—
always a disappointment. And there you were,
peeking from the stairway cupboard and
hiding under the hem of the tablemat. Ménage
à trois—although you were young, you couldn’t
possibly have meant it like that.
III.
The girls sit clustered in the house with the siding. They know
each others’ faces, names. They say nothing—
they pine.
IV.
I know the spaces you move through. How you speak,
at what cadence. With time I can feel my skin,
again, it accepts moisture like dried pavement does
rain. With time your mirage fades and I breathe,
again, I return finally from the burning house with smoke
in my lungs but they tell me there is fresh air all around.
V.
One day in the linoleum bathroom fluorescent light strokes my face
like a wavering finger. I remember, finally, that french song
sung by that french man on the trail leading back
from Monet’s house, all those years ago. I cup my chin
in my own palm, slow dance across grimy tile, brush my face
away from its reflection. One step, two, while I still
remember. La vie en rose. Tomorrow, she might be gone.
The girl who never could be a girl, never really. An arm raised,
a twirl. And if I wake up in the morning and she’s nowhere
to be found, she was here, for a moment, the unretouched portrait
of the girl who pulled me closer, held me fast.

A good movie or TV adaptation of a book can enhance its source material and introduce the books they’re based on to a wider audience. From “Catching Fire” to “Gone Girl,” here are some of The Crimson Arts’ favorite (and one not-so favorite) book-to-screen adaptations!
“The Godfather”
The screen adaptation of “The Godfather” is a rare instance where an adaptation eclipses the original piece of art. Widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, “The Godfather,” directed by Francis Ford Coppola in 1972, follows a powerful Italian crime family through their saga of triumphs and defeats. However, the iconic film was based on a lesser-known book by Mario Puzo, published three years prior. Puzo’s novel is an exemplary work of gangster fiction and a great piece of art in its own right, delving into complex and memorable characters, tangled familial relationships, and the subtle hierarchies of the mafia. And yet how is it that Puzo’s book is viewed merely as an excellent crime thriller, while the film is considered a masterpiece of cinema?
For art to be a masterpiece, it must be so creative and original that it overwhelms us with its storytelling power. The book is nothing quite so spectacular, but it does provide a riveting story that the movie uses as the canvas for its art. Everything about “The Godfather” film is utterly superb, from its Oscar-winning acting, rich and impeccably-paced plot, andbeautifully gut-wrenching score; to the way its setting and story are brought to life through a clear directorial vision. The film deserves its hype — it elevates Puzo’s book in every regard, transcending the original novel and cementing it as one of the best adaptations ever made.
—Staff writer Arielle C. Frommer can be reached at arielle.frommer@thecrimson.com.
“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”
Suzanne Collins’ “Hunger Games” trilogy is perhaps the most iconic literary series of the 21st century — its publication and ensuing popularity immediately led to the development of an incredibly successful film franchise. While all four adaptations are exceptional, it is the second book’s adaptation, “Catching Fire” (directed by Francis Lawrence), that steals the show. No other adaptation has ever been able to so flawlessly translate emotions from a book onto the big screen. Readers of the book will never feel closer to their beloved characters than when watching Katniss and Peeta share photos of their loved ones on the beach, or Katniss’s scream as Cinna is brought to his dismal end. Every detail is lovingly looked after and portrayed in the most engaging manner.
As Katniss herself says, “I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now and live in it forever.” “Catching Fire,” while horrifying, is so faithful to its source material that you never want to look away.
—Staff writer Hannah E. Gadway can be reached at hannah.gadway@thecrimson.com.
“A Series of Unfortunate Events”
Netflix’s TV series “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” which aired from 2017-2019, is everything your ten-year-old self wanted, a phrase which here means “a faithfully wretched adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s children’s series about three orphans.” But this Netflix adaptation is not only wretched — the show gives voice and vision to Snicket’s distinct melange of dark humor, bibliophilia, ethical dilemmas, and warnings against watching the unfolding tragedy. 13 mini-storylines translate colorfully into eccentric sets, fun guest stars (such as Joan Cusack and Catherine O’Hara), and absurd costumes, like the knife-heeled stilettos donned by Esmé Squalor (Lucy Punch). Standout Neil Patrick Harris disgusts as Count Olaf, perfectly visualizing the actor-villain. The mystery of the secret society V.F.D., which wasn’t originally included in the first four books, is retroactively included from the beginning of the show, which also strengthens the story’s sense of intrigue. Through the screen, Snicket afflicts a new generation with disturbing questions: Why is the world unfair? Are your parents good people? And what’s in the sugar bowl?
—Isabelle A. Lu
“Gone Girl”
“Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn is a book that readers will find exceptionally hard to put down. The story — one of family, dreams, nightmares, and revenge — will linger in readers’ minds long after finishing the book. The adaptation of the novel, directed by David Fincher and featuring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike as Nick and Amy Dunn, captures the essence of that story almost perfectly. Despite slow, widescreen camera movements and fatigued, desaturated colors, the film mockingly manages to stay one step ahead of its viewers. Infused with darkness and torment, laughter and beauty, the film incorporates exactly enough detail from the novel and turns it into an experience the viewer can truly be a part of.
—Staff writer Najya S. Gause can be reached at najya.gause@thecrimson.com.
“Becoming”
The 2020 Netflix documentary “Becoming” complements Michelle Obama’s 2018 memoir of the same name gracefully. Rather than being a direct adaptation of the book’s plot, the film revolves around the former First Lady’s book tour, showcasing her visits to schools and communities across the country. The film is beautiful in the way that it highlights young women at different points in their lives. From young girls to college students, the arc of Obama’s own life is reflected in the stories of those she meets. The film also includes interviews and clips of Obama’s family and friends, thus putting faces to the names of her memoir’s characters in a seamless and inspiring way.
—Lola J. DeAscentiis
“The Color Purple”
It’s easy for readers to be intimidated by any version of “The Color Purple,” be it Alice Walker’s novel, the film, or the musical. But while narratives of Black pain are often overrepresented in the media compared to narratives about excellence and justice, Walker grants full personhood to Black women and girls in her work — and for that, the world should be grateful. Her storytelling forges intergenerational connections between characters and shows the unfathomable struggles of Black Americans that are often forgotten. The 1985 film and its 2023 reboot bring together all-star casts of Black actors who channel the spirit of Walker’s words into an equally moving picture. For those who don’t love to read, the two adaptations of “The Color Purple” might make audiences reconsider. As books about Black people are being banned across the country, the impact of “The Color Purple” on culture and representation emphasizes the need to protect these stories.
—Staff writer Marley E. Dias can be reached at marley.dias@thecrimson.com.
“Shadow and Bone” (Season 1)
It is almost unheard of for an adaptation to be considered better than the original, yet the first season of “Shadow and Bone” did just that. The Netflix series, based primarily on Leigh Bardugo’s debut YA novels, tells the story of orphan mapmaker Alina Starkov (Jessie Mei Li) with the legendary power to summon sunlight. In the show’s first season, Alina must navigate the numerous nefarious plots targeting her, all the while dealing with her own complicated relationship with her identity as a member of the persecuted Grisha minority. While the show does deviate from the books, changes made to the adaptation — such as Alina’s biracial identity, the incorporation of characters from the spinoff duology “Six of Crows,” and the threats of a civil war between East and West Ravka — enrich the storyline and flesh out the worldbuilding. Coupled with amazing performances from the entire main cast and a killer soundtrack, Season 1 of “Shadow and Bone” proves itself to be the perfect book adaptation for fans of Leigh Bardugo’s amazing Grishaverse.
—Alexandria T.Q. Ho
Bonus WORST Adaptation: “Shadow and Bone” (Season 2)
There is no greater disappointment than seeing your favorite characters and storylines be completely butchered by writers after waiting two years. Season 2 of “Shadow and Bone” attempts to cover three books, juggle a 15-member cast, and set up the showrunner’s yet-to-be-greenlit spinoff project, resulting in a messy, underdeveloped, and unsatisfying conclusion to Alina Starkov’s (Jessie Mei Li) journey. The only bright spot of the season comes from the once-again stellar performances from the cast, especially Li, Barnes, Freddy Carter, and Daisy Head. However, even with their best efforts, the damage done is too great. Whether you’re a fan of the Grisha Trilogy, “Six of Crows,” or Season 1, it’s hard to feel anything but anger and disappointment at the direction of Season 2 of “Shadow and Bone.”

“I tried to become American, but America is toxic. I tried to become Mexican, but México is toxic,” award-winning poet José Olivarez writes in “Ars Poetica,” a poem in his new collection “Promises of Gold.”
“My work: to do more than reproduce the toxic stories I inherited & learned ... My work: to write poems that make my people feel safe, seen, or otherwise loved,” he finished.
As the son of Mexican immigrants, Olivarez’s voice has often focused on his experience in a Mexican family. His highly acclaimed 2018 debut poetry book, “Citizen Illegal,” touched on both political and personal topics of immigration, citizenship, liberty, and dreams. After experiencing Covid-19 and changes in both interpersonal and living circumstances during the last four years, the content of Olivarez’s writing changed too. In “Promises of Gold,” he documents and celebrates the ordinary aspects of life while continuing to speak on the lingering effects of immigration on the experiences of individuals and families alike.
"Promises of Gold" is split into eleven sections, each containing between four and 13 poems. The sections are given titles such as “Gold,” “Glory,” and “God,” again tracing back to Olivarez’s Mexican roots and inspirations. Despite the sorting of poems into sections, Olivarez's poems are not chronologically ordered or thematically categorized. Even in each section, poems jump back and forth between different stories and emotions, though most speak specifically to experiences with family and friends, with an underlying appreciation for such figures in Olivarez’s own life. Occasional poems scattered throughout the book illuminate the instabilities of love and politics, but as Olivarez writes in his book introduction, the majority of the poems are “for the homies.”
With this intended audience in mind, Olivarez does an excellent job of capturing ordinary interactions with people in his life, creating poignant short stories, and connecting them to larger themes and ideas. In poems like “Regret or My Day Says Love,” “Nate Calls Me Soft," and “No More Sad Mexicans,” Olivarez paints portraits of family members and friends, brothers and lovers, musicians and taco-makers — all while lingering on the little things that he notices about each, from the emotions that pour from his quiet relatives’ mouths after a few drinks to the nonchalant responses from friends when asked about their wellbeing.
Furthermore, Olivarez’s distinctive colloquial writing style within the poems of each section brings a sense of informality to the experiences he writes about, which helps him further connect with readers. Instead of rigid stanzas or sentences, Olivarez embraces structural freedom. This freedom appears in the poems’ content as well, effortlessly moving back and forth between his experiences and his reflections. The poems are offered like stories to the reader, and if read aloud, one could imagine each as a story shared by a close friend during a casual conversation. “Promises of Gold” becomes an immersive experience, allowing readers to intimately experience conservations with Olivarez and glimpse his innermost thoughts.
It’s not only Olivarez’s excellent storytelling and unique poetic voice that makes “Promises of Gold” stand out as a one-of-a-kind poetry book. Spanish poet David Ruano’s Spanish translations of Olivarez’s poems into “Promesas de Oro” — accessible by flipping over the book and starting from the back cover — open the book to a larger audience. Olivarez’s choice to provide a translation of his book also captures another defining second-generation immigrant experience: translating for family members and other loved ones who cannot speak English. Olivarez explained in an interview with The Chicago Review of Books that he was specifically inspired by an experience in which the parents of students in his poetry workshops had expressed their wish to read his poems alongside their children. He then took the initiative to advocate for a Spanish-friendly version of his writing, which “Promesas de Oro” soundly delivers.
Ruano’s translations of “Promises of Gold” are overall direct translations in both meaning and voice, presented in a colloquial tone and easily understandable. While all of the intentions and meanings behind Olivarez’s poems are kept, Ruano occasionally makes small changes to better adjust Olivarez’s story to a Spanish-speaking audience. In the translator's note, he makes distinctions between the different options he faces when translating English words into Spanish ones. One such example was the translation of “Mexican” into either “mexicano,” which means a Mexican who lives in Mexico, or “Mexican,” which means a Mexican who has migrated from Mexico to America. These little nuances in Ruano’s translations make “Promesas de Oro” much more authentic to read, and they likely also make Olivarez’s ideas more approachable to Spanish-speaking audiences.
Ultimately, “Promises of Gold” is a uniquely bilingual celebration of life and the mundane. Both Olivarez’s works and Ruano’s translations do an excellent job of capturing the essence of celebrating and appreciating life — despite its imperfections — for what it is. The writing in “Promises of Gold” and “Promesas de Oro” is clear and simple, yet easily navigates complex ideas and reflects on real-world experiences. While inspired by Olivarez’s distinctly second-generation Mexican immigrant experiences, “Promises of Gold” expresses themes of hope, dreams, family, and friendship that can apply to anyone, regardless of their background. It’s filled with all types of stories and promises — big and small, vague and specific, organized and messy. It’s a promise that life is more than just constant success, and more than happiness, sadness, or grief. It's a promise that Olivarez understands his readers, acknowledges the hardships they may have overcome, and wants them to “feel safe, seen, or otherwise loved.” And it’s also Olivarez’s personal promise to his readers that life is never just simple, but rather — if they embrace the right mindset — an experience that can offer overwhelming growth, appreciation, and happiness.

Before even the first page of “Monstrilio,” the back of the book promises to shock. In his debut novel, Gerardo Sámano Córdova dives head-first into a complex blend of conventional literary fiction and disquieting horror. The story, which is told from four perspectives — Magos, a grieving mother; Joseph, her husband; Lena, her best friend; and Monstrilio, the monster itself — follows the tragic loss of a child named Santiago and the growth of a piece of his lung into a monster that eventually emulates the boy that he was carved from. Though the surreal horror and gothic elements complicate what might have otherwise been a more typical vignette of grief, Córdova captures a sense of grim reality in the characters’ mourning, shedding a light on the differences in the way parents, family, and friends cope with loss. The book’s departures from realism only enhance this message of healing and introspection, giving the novel an insightful and deeply human quality.
Stylistically, “Monstrilio” shines. An intimate stream-of-consciousness writing style places the reader directly in the mind of the narrator, yet the prose’s depth and beauty keeps the book a page-turner. Unique and somewhat confusing epithets build intrigue on each page, such as when Magos remarks that “Jackie’s voice was calm, her aura of hair springy” — though the two descriptors seemingly have nothing to do with each other. Córdova has evidently mastered the art of show, don’t tell, especially in the section narrated by Magos, selectively interrupting the plot with powerful anecdotes from her past which help to explain the troubled inner workings of her mind. This is especially apparent in descriptions of Magos’s complex emotions, which are spelled out through her strange actions rather than words. Vivid imagery underscores the prose throughout this work.
Córdova embraces an ambitious but coherently delivered cocktail of themes to the audience. Common threads of loss, love, sexuality, and humanity weave together the four diverse perspectives offered in the novel. The narrative frequently subverts gothic and horror tropes, especially in Magos’s section. Rather than a ghost-like woman withering from grief, as is common in horror, Magos observes her husband suffering through the grieving process. Similarly, Córdova is unafraid to explore female lust and desire, even in the face of grief — a luxury often only afforded to men in the genre.
But disappointingly, many of the strongest gothic and horror elements fade into the background as the story progresses past its first narrator. By the time the story is handed to Joseph, the third narrator, the tried-and-true setting of a gothic home — exemplified by both Magos’s crumbling family estate in Las Lomas and her home with Joseph in New York — is long gone, as the plot is uprooted from its original settings of upstate New York and Mexico to instead float between New York City and Berlin. It’s in this transition that the plot starts to lose its footing.
The biggest flaw of the novel lies in the shifting narration. The first narrator, Magos, has a fascinating internal mind that the reader is eager to occupy; the frenzy and coldness of her maternal pain is complex, forming a puzzle to unravel. By comparison, the middle two narrators — Lena and Joseph — are less interesting. Lena’s unrequited feelings are left unresolved, at least to the external perspectives narrated by Joseph and Monstrilio, and Magos’s character shifts quite drastically while the reader is viewing the world through Joseph’s eyes. Indeed, while the novel is on the longer side as a whole, each part individually yearned for more.
Nonetheless, “Monstrilio” offers an entertaining and shocking read. Unafraid to break precedent and push boundaries of genre, Córdova brings his lusciously descriptive style from the short stories that he is known for to the brave new world of long-form fiction with relative success. Captivating from the first pages and with decent follow-through, there is no lack of introspection to be had. The satisfying conclusion adeptly ties together what otherwise might have been somewhat disjointed, crafting an overall cohesive arc. Rest assured, “Monstrilio” is a wild ride that questions the limits of love, family, and what it means to be human.

What comes to mind when you hear the term “horse girl”? Probably tall boots, neatly braided hair, graphic tees, and a carefree facade. Certainly not a horse-turned-DJ heading a room full of sweaty, dancing partygoers and fist-pumping tattooed arms.
Affiliated with the Berlin-based label and artist collective Live From Earth — a techno label that embraces experiments with hardcore, trance, and other genres — horsegiirL is a project that clearly started as a bit and then committed to it. The DJ and electronic artist plays all her sets in a giant horse mask that fully covers her head and neck —  an outstanding feat when you consider the temperature of the rooms she plays in and the mask’s poor ventilation.  She calls all her fans “Farmies” and claims, quite simply, to be a horse named Stella with some very human problems. horsegiirL’s song lyrics parody the tropes of pop and rap lyrics about love and sex: “I graze the range land on my own / and in the barn I'm all alone / This farm no longer is my home / Since you been gone since you been gone,” she sings in the chorus of “Harvest Heartbreak,” one of her more recent singles. “My barn / my rules / my toys / my tools,” she sings in the refrain of “My Barn, My Rules,” off her first EP. horsegiirL’s aesthetic is pure kitsch: stylized script font and excessive emojis feature in her Instagram captions; vibrant colors and sparkly graphic effects accentuate her pictures. Little information is available online about horsegiirL, not even her real name.
Her story, it seems, is the one she’s written for herself.
horsegiirL released her first EP, “Farm Fantasies” — a collaborative project with MCR-T, her labelmate on Live From Earth — roughly a year ago. Since then, she’s garnered over 75,000 listeners on streaming platforms. Despite its whimsy, her music isn’t just good because her act is a funny concept. Yes, you might be listening to a DJ with a horse head mix an original track about jealousy for her farmer’s new horse and how she misses eating carrots — but that’s only the gimmick. The music itself is undeniably catchy and danceable.
What makes horsegiirL stand out as a musician is her position at the intersection of techno and hyperpop. A seemingly niche act, horsegiirL embodies a transatlantic combination of the current moment’s musical sensibilities. The 2020s have seen the growing popularity, mostly in the Americas, of hyperpop — whimsical, maximalist, heavily-autotuned pop-electronic music — with the rise of artists like 100 gecs, Charli XCX, Arca, and SOPHIE. Meanwhile, techno — fast, repetitive electronic dance music favored in Europe (though it originated in Detroit) — has evolved to embrace crossover from genres such as hardcore and trance but remained distanced from pop’s emphasis on lyric storytelling and saccharine aesthetics.
On “Farm Fatale,” released on Feb. 24, horsegiirL combines these genres, layering airy, bubbly vocals over a fast, repetitive beat, with a mixture of harsh and melodic sounds. “Farm Fatale” is her first solo EP, strengthening her footing as an electronic musician and producer.
The most disappointing thing about the EP is that there isn’t more of it: With only three songs totalling just over six minutes, it didn’t deliver the the solid wave of new horsegiirL beats fans have been eagerly awaiting. The first two songs are enjoyable listens, but not as exciting as her work on “Farm Fantasies.” The high-energy brevity of “Green Grass (Intro)” could be used to make her already fast-paced DJ sets feel even faster. “Saddle” intersperses bird noises with a bouncy reverb.
However, the obvious highlight is the final and longest song; At a 2:32 playtime, “Praise the Farm,” shapes horsegiirL’s persona into horse-turned-outlaw in the style of old crime movies. “Praise the Farm” was released ahead of the EP as a single, the cover of which depicts horsegiirL leaning out of a crookedly parked car, clutching a purse, and pointing out of the frame, floodlights rendering only her blown out silhouette and the dramatic shadow of her horse mask visible.
On “Green Grass (Intro)” and “Saddle,” horsegiirL’s riffs about living on a farm and being a horse start to feel like generic filler. This is fine; nobody expects the lyrics over a solid techno beat to be particularly remarkable — that’s part of what makes the parodic element of horsegiirL’s lyrics regularly so amusing. But while something seems missing in “Green Grass (Intro)” and “Saddle,” “Praise the Farm” reinvigorates the intensely-focused, whimsical play of her past songs, carrying the EP across the finish line. horsegiirL sings about rebelling from a well-intentioned upbringing for material gain: “I praise the farm / then break the stall / a good ass horse / but bad ass thoughts / I know my mama raised me to be better than this / I gotta get this paper you know I'll never miss.” Of all the songs on the EP, “Praise the Farm” has the heaviest, steadiest beat. The sirens in the background of the intro give way to a galloping momentum that makes it impossible not to dance.
Though “Farm Fatale” doesn’t feel as consistent as one might hope, it’s a solid first solo EP that ends with a bang.

In “All the Beauty in the World,” debut author Patrick Bringley presents a stunning meditation on time, relationships, and finding purpose. Bringley brings readers on a journey of ruminating in the stillness of his grief to reentering the busier, louder world – which he finds full of renewed meaning.
Bringley, a former staffer for the New Yorker magazine, begins his story by explaining his decision to quit his job after losing his older brother to cancer. As a result of his changed perspective after this devastating loss, Bringley intentionally steps away from his busy New York lifestyle to pursue a slower pace. He ultimately chooses to become a security guard at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Throughout the book, Bringley provides precious insights into the emotional mindset and events he experienced during his brother’s illness. Instead, he shares his life at the museum, beginning with simple observations of seemingly mundane moments of daily life. In painstaking detail, Bringley describes his first moments at the Met, getting to know coworkers and learning the different room assignments. For a less-skillful writer, this detail might bog down the writing. However, Bringley pays such compassionate attention to enlivening both his coworkers and his work that the detail only serves to augment the contemplative tone of the memoir. But most of all, he describes the art.
Bringley presents art museums as a haven for the world. He offers descriptions of art that may be too detailed for some readers. Some readers, though, may find that these intricate details draw them into the same pensive state of mind, the same thought processes that Bringley himself existed within. What “All the Beauty in the World” lacks in exclusive detail about Bringley’s personal life, it compensates for it in stunning insight into Bringley’s mental space. His humble awareness of self and others refreshes readers.
While reading about Bringley’s everyday life, time slows. Did all of Bringley’s days really pass in this dreamlike trance of tranquility and reflection?
“I feel that I’ve surrendered to the turtleish movement of a watchman’s time. I can’t spend the time. I can’t fill it, or kill it, or fritter it into smaller bits,” Bringley writes. “What might be excruciating if suffered for an hour or two is oddly easy to bear in large doses.”
“All the Beauty in the World” is a written testimony to the power of intentionally stepping out of the dizzying rush of life to take the time for stillness. Bound between the prose of a memoir, readers will find a love letter to art.
Bringley’s view uniquely balances the microscopic encounters in life with macroscopic details of the world. While he zooms out on time, looking at millennia and tracing patterns in history, he then zooms into one moment: one person’s facial expression, the question of a museum-going student, the paint strokes of a Picasso.
“I think sometimes we need permission to stop and adore,” he writes, “and a work of art grants us that.”
From a philosophical perspective, Bringley pulls the reader in, gently convincing them that life is not a race, that it need not be spent speeding towards some unreachable, unattainable goal. He offers that the best course of action at times may be admiring the stillness of silence.
Ultimately, Bringley’s writing paints a softer world. Bringley reflects, “On a typical day, it is easy to glance at strangers and forget the most fundamental things about them: that they’re just as real as you are; that they’ve triumphed and suffered; that like you they’re engaged in something (living) that is hard and rich and brief.”
His words and the art he describes elevate the mundane to the realm of the sacred: “I am sometimes not sure which is the more remarkable: that life lives up to great paintings, or that great paintings live up to life.”
Instead of choosing a darker path, Bringley chooses to look with greater love and care at all around him. He speaks with a great humility, noting that it’s a “fortunate” day that he “can look with love at the tired, preoccupied faces of strangers.”
Just when it seems the comforting silence will envelop all of life, Bringley begins to exit the museum bubble. He takes the reader along on the journey to find love, get married, and become a father. Slowly, noise trickles back into his life as his ever present grief begins to fade. As he builds a life with his new wife, he learns the joys and difficulties of fatherhood and he begins to feel a desire to expand his talents beyond the walls of the Met.
On the whole, Bringley offers precious insights into his private life. His conclusions by the end of the book display a remarkable maturity and depth of thought, as he recognizes a growth within himself, a purpose for life, and a time and a place for all things.
As he says, “Sometimes, life can be about simplicity and stillness, in the vein of a watchful guard amid shimmering works of art. But it is also about the head-down work of living and struggling and growing and creating.”

Harlem, New York, is a breeding ground for some of the finest lyricists the hip-hop world has ever seen. Among those artists is the enigmatic Knowledge the Pirate, whose vintage sound is modernizing golden-age hip-hop for a new generation. Along with his longtime collaborator Roc Marciano, Knowledge the Pirate is recognized by fans and critics alike as a key figure in the commercial resurgence of classic hip-hop, spearheaded by groups like Griselda Records. This commitment to his roots has garnered him a devoted fan base that appreciates his commitment to authentic hip-hop.
Knowledge the Pirate has released a steady string of projects since his 2018 debut album “Flintlock,” with the recently released "Five Pounds of Pressure" marking his fifth album in as many years. The rapper cites golden-era rappers such as KRS-ONE, Big Daddy Kane, and Rakim as significant influences while emphasizing the importance of making music with meaning that’s not just about rhyming words. He labels his style as an “Underground New Wave Rap Renaissance,” illuminating the rapper’s intention to bring hip-hop back to its roots.
“I think this sound took hold because we're in an Instagram era and people's patience is very short,” the rapper said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “That lower level frequency music has reached its peak. It’s time for history to be renewed. What goes around, comes around, it’s just the natural process of life. So now, the genre is coming back to where it started from.”
Knowledge the Pirate cites his involvement with the Five Percent Nation, a cultural movement closely associated with Islam that originated in New York City during the 1960s, as a key part of his identity. The Five Percent Nation has had a profound impact on hip-hop culture, influencing work from the likes of Busta Rhymes, Wu-Tang Clan, and al.divino. The movement has shaped Knowledge the Pirate’s perspective on life as well as his music, with his name emerging from a combination of his Five Percenter background and his own upbringing.
“Knowledge is something that I got from the Nation and having knowledge of myself as an African American and my ancestral background,” Knowledge the Pirate said. “I chose to call myself Knowledge because I like to study and read. The pirate stuff that came from my lifestyle. I lived everywhere. I was always poor and moving here and moving there. Never had stability. I was always navigating the streets like a pirate.”
The rapper’s name is also inspired by the history of pirates. “This pirate stuff isn't no savage shit,” he added. “They were actually stopping slavery. They were running down on the slave ships and letting the slaves go free and telling them, ‘You can come join us. Fuck this shit.’”
Initially starting out as a battle rapper, Knowledge the Pirate has forged many strong creative partnerships throughout his career. One of his most notable collaborations is with fellow New York rapper, Roc Marciano, with whom he has had a friendship for over twenty years. Knowledge the Pirate recently featured on “The Elephant Man’s Bones,” Roc Marciano’s critically acclaimed collaborative album with The Alchemist that was released last August. The pair first met at a battle rap showcase in a New York City basement.
“He spit and I spit, but we didn’t battle. We had a mutual respect for each other.” Knowledge the Pirate said. “We were together every day for damn near twenty years. Everything that Rocky has done or we have done, we've planned together.”
Knowledge the Pirate recalled the early days of recording Marciano’s 2010 album “Marcberg” and his influence on the process.
“At the time, New York hip-hop was dead,” the rapper said. “It had moved down South. Everybody was doing that down south stuff, lean with it, rock with it type shit. So I was like, ‘Yo, Roc, only way I'm rapping is if you start producing again.’ I told him, ‘Bro your beats just got the sound. You got the sound that can bring New York back.’”
In his music, Knowledge the Pirate brings authentic experiences from his life to the forefront, offering listeners a glimpse into the real-life stories that have shaped his journey. With projects such as 2021’s "Hidden Treasure" and his collaboration last year with producer Big Ghost LTD. On the album "Wolves Don’t Eat With the Shepherd's," Knowledge the Pirate continues to push the boundaries of his sound, proving that he remains an important tastemaker in East Coast hip-hop.
As for what's next on the horizon, Knowledge the Pirate is currently working on his upcoming album, "Five Pounds of Pressure," which will feature production from Element and Roc Marciano. After that, fans can expect a full-length project produced entirely by Marciano, which is sure to be an incredible addition to his already impressive discography.
“We always make great music together,” Knowledge the Pirate said of Marciano. “I love to see his success as well as mine. I thank God that at this age, we're able to do what we really love.”

As the first vocalist from K-pop supergroup BTS to release a full album, Jimin’s “FACE” is one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2023. While Jimin has previously released solo tracks under the BTS moniker — “Lie,” “Intro: Serendipity,” and “Filter” — “FACE” marks Jimin’s official debut as a solo artist following his January collaboration, “Vibe,” with BIGBANG’s Taeyang. On “FACE” Jimin sets a high bar for his contemporaries, taking listeners on a genre-bending exploration of his inner psyche, defining a groovy and seductive sound along the way.
“Face-off” serves as an apt opener to the album, detailing a messy break-up with hints at the themes of loneliness, escapism, and introspection to follow on later tracks. The song opens with an ominous and haunting rendition of “Flea Waltz,” growing increasingly distorted before cutting out and transitioning to the equally eerie opening notes of “Face-off.” Underlaid with a trap beat driving the song forward, “Face-off” builds to an intense and bitter climax as Jimin laments “Tonight I don’t want to be sober / Pour it up, it’s all fuckin over.”
As the album’s second track, “Interlude : Dive” comes startling early, serving as a transition rather than a stand alone song. Yet, it fits the album’s storyline well, moving from the outwardly targeted anger of “Face-off” to the dreamlike introspection of “Like Crazy,” as listeners hear sounds pulled from across Jimin’s day. From the cheers of fans at BTS’s “Yet to Come in Busan” Concert to the sound of a car starting and a drink pouring into a glass, the interlude brings listers from the highs of celebrity life to the lows of lonely nights.
“Like Crazy” is a clear standout from the album, serving as the project’s title track and referencing the 2011 film of the same name. The seductive synthpop single opens with the soaring and breathy vocals that Jimin has become known for as a member of BTS. Filling out the vocals on the pre-chorus and adding a distinct synth bass, the track evolves from the whispered promises of a lover to a willful escape into late nights and alcohol as Jimin repeats “I’d rather be / lost in the lights.” Skillfully toeing the line between danceable beats and catchy melodies, “Like Crazy” leans into its ’80s influence, heightened by the accompanying choreography and styling, both evoking the style of Michael Jackson. The album’s sixth track is a full English version of the song, paving the way for US performances including the song’s debut on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
In many ways, “Alone” is a clear response to the energetic high and promised escapism of “Like Crazy.” Rather than escaping to parties and crowds, “Alone” explores the self-hatred that emerges when the music and lights disappear. In an interview with Dispatch, Jimin has stated that “FACE” represents a chronological retelling of his emotions throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Nowhere is this clearer than on “Alone,” where the monotonous repetition of each day in isolation forces self-reflection during lonely nights. The introspective track ends ominously as Jimin sings “it's gonna be alright” while “lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie” echoes through the background.
If the other tracks were meant to blend seamlessly into one another, “Set Me Free, Pt.2” shocks listeners with a jarring change of pace by beginning with ominous stacked harmonies sung by a full choir before a bombastic beat drop. While “FACE” is a tour across different genres, on this track Jimin returns to BTS’s hip-hop roots embracing a level of grandeur on scale with that of BTS’s “ON.” Unfortunately, the grand scale of the song eclipses its melodic merit which gets lost in an overproduced cacophony of horns, choirs, and sirens, ending an otherwise poignant and thoughtful album on a sour note.
Luckily, the physical CD comes with an extra hidden track which follows two minutes and 45 seconds of silence after the English version of “Like Crazy.” This bonus track — “Letter” — is a delightful ballad complete with a harmonica solo and backing vocals from fellow BTS member Jungkook. While the love song might have been out of place on an album that's central theme is introspection and self-reflection, the song's absence from streaming services will be lamented for years to come.
While mini albums as short as “FACE” — just five tracks and an English version of “Like Crazy” — can often sound like a disjointed collection of B-sides, the album sets itself apart through seamless transitions that takes listeners from track to track telling a cohesive story of doubt and discovery. While each song can be listened to individually, it’s clear that it was designed to be listened to from start to finish in a single setting. With a runtime of just under 20 minutes, Jimin takes listeners on a journey of heartbreak, avoidance, introspection, loneliness, and eventually, hesitant self-acceptance.

There are some pieces of art that just feel powerful. The Mona Lisa innocently hanging in her 30-inch frame in the Louvre, feels powerful. “2001: A Space Odyssey” feels powerful; when minutes of spaceship sequences accompanied by nothing but “The Blue Danube” remain impossibly captivating: That’s power. There’s a variety of musical entries too: Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” and Beethoven’s “Symphony no. 5” both spring to mind. But in the rock world, none achieve this status quite like “Dark Side of the Moon.” The two sides of the album each play like one uninterrupted piece of music; without looking it’s incredibly difficult to pinpoint where one song ends and another begins. And in these two fluid acts, Pink Floyd’s exploration of the human mind and their exploration of musical experimentation come together to form an album that, like other timeless pieces of art, just feels powerful.
“I’ve been mad for fucking years” are the first words to greet a listener of “Dark Side of the Moon,” and that might as well be the album in a nutshell. This blurb and others like it come from Pink Floyd bassist, songwriter, and co-founder Roger Waters’s recording members of the band’s crew answering questions ranging from the innocence of “What’s your favorite food?” to “When was the last time you were violent?” and “Were you in the right?” These answers, sprinkled throughout the album along with the occasional quasi-maniacal laughter, set the scene for an intense introspection into what makes a man mad.
Yet perhaps the album’s greatest strength is the way it forces the listener to play an active role — the album is less of a display of human madness and more of a conversation that encourages the listener to tease the answers out for themselves.
The lyrics “Breathe, breathe in the air / Don’t be afraid to care” are the first sung lyrics that a listener hears on the second track, “Breathe (In the Air),” and they might be the most upbeat ones of the whole album. Whatever lull of peace the opening manages to exude, by the time the carefree drumbeat and bluesy, sliding chords of “Breathe” reach their conclusion, guitarist and singer David Gilmour is already lamenting how the endless cycle of daily work is nothing more than a “race towards an early grave.”
As “Breathe” transitions seamlessly into “On the Run,” the song’s two themes likewise move from trying to stay calm in the face of perpetual toil and clearly failing, to falling into what can only be described as a musical panic attack. In “On The Run,” the rapid, sixteenth note hi-hats underscore the EMS synthesizer, constantly stabbing the listener with the same eight note melody repeated ad infinitum. And yet, despite these two constants, Pink Floyd experiments with vocal clips, machine gun-like noises, and their signature maniacal laughter to build up to a carnage-filled plane crash worthy of a Jimi Hendrix Woodstock performance.
Once the panic attack of “On the Run” subsides, a cacophony of clock ticks and bell chimes drag the listener into arguably the album’s best song, and the only one to credit all four band members as writers, “Time.” Setting the scene with a relentless pairing of metronome and heartbeat followed by slow, powerful chord changes and echoing drums, the song seems to interrogate the listener’s perception of time from the very start.
But in just two couplets, the sudden mood change and Gilmour’s singing immediately feel like a slap in the face, with lyrics that represent the very best of Pink Floyd’s songwriting. “Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day / Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way,” epitomizes Waters’ ability to capture and perfectly depict a mundane idea, like wasting away a day. Somehow, that couplet feels exactly like watching a day go by. The second couplet, “The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older / shorter of breath and one day closer to death,” represents Waters’ deeper storytelling, which again forces the listener to figure out for themselves what the song means to them.
“Time” runs through its magnificent guitar solo, a relieving reprise of “Breath,” and finally fades out, and Side One of “Dark Side of the Moon” comes to a close with “The Great Gig in the Sky.” With a title that impeccably captures its energy, session singer Clare Tory unleashes the full extent of her vocal prowess for over three minutes of wordless, pure expression.
“Money,” one of the album’s singles, opens Side Two of the album with an aptly-themed rhythm made from sounds of coins and a cash register. Thematically quite distinct from the rest of the album, “Money” talks about just that, albeit somewhat ironically, as the release of “Dark Side of the Moon” first made the members of Pink Floyd incredibly rich. Interestingly, Waters encourages the rich not to engage in any “goody good bullshit,” which has also aged somewhat poorly considering the recent controversial allegations on the subject of anti-semitism and the Israel-Palestine conflict. In any case, the biggest strengths of “Money” are its two solos, on saxophone and guitar, that burst with energy and carry momentum until the beginning of “Us and Them” calms down.
The subsequent longest song on the album and the second single, “Us and Them” serves as an initially mellow and very vague interrogation into the meaninglessness of war. With lines like “God only knows it’s not what we would choose to do” and “the general sat and the lines on the map / moved from side to side,” Waters and fellow cofounder, keyboardist, and songwriter Richard Wright point out the counterintuitive and top-down nature of war in a method reminiscent of the decade prior. The song’s incredibly powerful chorus does the topic justice, but the most unique part is again an interview, where roadie Roger “The Hat” Manifold tells a story about an entanglement: “Well I mean, they're not gonna kill ya, so like, if you give 'em a quick sh ... short, sharp shock, they don't do it again. Dig it? I mean 'e got off light, 'cause I coulda given 'im a thrashin' but I only hit 'im once. It's only the difference between right and wrong innit?” Effortlessly capturing the ideas of the song, moments like these are where the genius of Pink Floyd shine through: On a topic that’s been sung about hundreds of times, only Pink Floyd brings a first-hand experience that makes the listener bring war back to day-to-day life.
The album comes to a close with the instrumental “Any Colour You Like,” followed by the songs “Brain Damage” and “Eclipse,” which morph into one fluid outro. “Brain Damage” serves as a pivotal moment in the album, taking on the question of madness more directly than any other song, with lines like “the lunatic is in my head” being paired with the ever present laughter. But in the midst of these swells of mental instability, “Brain Damage” assures the listener, “And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too / I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.” Somehow, in the deepest throes of mental health issues, “Brain Damage” brings a crumb of comfort: The listener will not be there alone.
The album’s last lyrics, “everything under the sun is in tune / but the sun is eclipsed by the moon” lay the final claim: While darkness and turbulent emotions inevitably await the listener, they await everyone else too. And, as the heartbeat that faded in to open the album fades out to close it, Pink Floyd’s magnum opus reveals why it exudes that sense of sheer power like only select pieces of art. Because, as you listen to it in 2023, 50 years after its release, “Dark Side of the Moon” somehow still manages to leave you feeling like something inside you has changed irreversibly. With every listen, be it your first or twentieth, “Dark Side of the Moon” forces you to come to terms with your own sanity, all the while remaining one of the most legendary rock albums of all time.

Digital streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music have radically altered the music industry. Any song you could ever want to hear, only two clicks away at all times! Unfortunately, this isn’t always true. Fans of American hip-hop group De La Soul – consisting of members Kelvin "Posdnuos" Mercer, David "Trugoy the Dove" Jolicoeur, and Vincent "Maseo" Mason — have been grieving their missing discography for years. Sample clearance and contracting issues made it impossible for anyone to digitally buy or stream the albums that inspired some of today’s biggest artists. To add insult to injury, last month's unexpected death of one of De La Soul’s founding members, Trugoy the Dove, left fans mourning with no way of revisiting his musical legacy. Bittersweetly, two weeks after Trugoy’s death and years after the start of this toilsome battle, De La Soul’s legendary catalog finally made it to streaming platforms on March 3.
Formed in 1988 in Long Island, New York, De La Soul rose to fame with the help of producer Prince Paul after releasing their debut album “3 Feet High and Rising” (1989). The album was an immediate success, showcasing the group’s witty, playful wordplay and colorful, eclectic style. De La Soul continued to release music, and their subsequent albums were met with critical acclaim. They were also a part of Native Tongues — a late ’80s/early ’90s hip-hop collective featuring members such as the Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, Monie Love, and Queen Latifah — which unabashedly brought positive and good-natured Afrocentric lyrics to the mainstream. Although they were Grammy-nominated thrice on their own, De La Soul’s only Grammy win was earned for the Best Pop Vocal Collaboration in 2005 after their collaboration with Gorillaz on their hit single “Feel Good Inc.”
De La Soul’s streaming issues date back to their conflict with Tom Silverman of Tommy Boy Records, which owns the rights to their music. In a 2019 interview, Trugoy the Dove explained that Silverman did not believe “3 Feet High and Rising” would do well and therefore, decided to clear the album’s samples for only physical media releases and not digital ones. In 2014, the group, out of frustration, released their entire discography on their website, allowing fans to download it for free for one day. “We've been blessed to be in the Library of Congress, but we can't even have our music on iTunes,” the group told Rolling Stone at the time.
Another negotiation to put the group’s music on streaming platforms was attempted in 2019, but the contract left De La Soul with only 10% of streaming revenue. The public was outraged that the group would be inadequately compensated, resulting in Tommy Boy abandoning their plan. Fortunately, the issue was finally resolved when Reservoir Media acquired Tommy Boy in 2021 and worked with the trio over the past two years to reach an agreement which satisfied all parties.
This may seem like the happy ending fans wanted, but it is important to consider the impact that these messy business negotiations had on De La Soul’s musical legacy. So much of what people listen to today is directly linked to what is available on digital streaming platforms. No matter how much incredible music you make, does it really matter if no one can hear it? Despite their undeniably profound impact on hip-hop history, the absence of De La Soul’s discography on streaming platforms effectively minimized their relevance in conversation today.
All of this comes, of course, only weeks after the tragic passing of Trugoy the Dove, age 54. In a letter written to him after his death on Instagram, Maseo wrote, “On one end I’m happy you no longer have to suffer the pain of your condition, but on the other hand I’m extremely upset at the fact that you’re not here to celebrate and enjoy what we worked and fought so hard to achieve.”
With Trugoy’s passing, the Black community mourns the untimely death of yet another rapper. Over and over again, they have lost the people who vocalized so much of the pain, joy, and unity that runs through the heart of the community — be that to violence or natural causes. Hip-hop fans have run out of tears. Now, they turn to music to keep them going.
Luckily, the albums “3 Feet High and Rising” (1989), “De La Soul Is Dead” (1991), “Buhloone Mindstate” (1993), “Stakes Is High” (1996), “Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump” (2000), and “AOI: Bionix” (2001) have been released from their musical limbo and can finally help fans everywhere groove, grieve, learn, and laugh.

On March 17, Taylor Swift began her highly anticipated The Eras Tour, debuting a setlist of 44 songs spanning her entire discography. Yes, you read that correctly. Forty. Four. Songs. The setlist covered some of her biggest hits like “Love Story” as well as surprising deep cuts such as “tolerate it.” Yet, even with a nearly perfect setlist, some of her best and most loved songs didn’t make the cut. Here are 10 songs that were painfully snubbed from the Era’s Tour setlist.
“Our Song”
“Our Song”
Swift not giving her debut self-titled album its own section is understandable due to her expansive discography. But as one of her most iconic country songs to date, “Our Song” deserved a moment to shine.
“The Way I Loved You”
“The Way I Loved You”
A very underrated album track with an infectious chorus simply meant to be played in a stadium, “The Way I Loved You” was overshadowed by the sheer number of hits from 2008’s “Fearless.” The song sends you on a rollercoaster of emotions that Swift would have executed perfectly for the audience. Ultimately, even the song's resurgence on TikTok wasn’t enough to earn it a spot on the setlist.
The entire “Speak Now” album
The entire “Speak Now” album
Every “Speak Now” stan’s face dropped when Swift moved onto the “Red” era after performing just one song — “Enchanted” — from “Speak Now.” No “Sparks Fly?” No “Mine?” No “Long Live?” To not give the stadium a chance to sing “I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you” is an actual travesty. Justice must be had for Swift’s most underrated album.
“I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)”
“I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s Version)”
Yes, Swift performing another vault track is unrealistic but let's be delusional for a second. The theatrics of the song would translate perfectly into the high production of the Era’s tour. Imagine the on-screen visuals: the silver-spoon gated community; The living room dancing and kitchen table bills; The million dollar couch. The vision is clear.
“Out of the Woods”
“Out of the Woods”
The vocals that Swift gives every time she plays this song live demand a spot on the setlist. Not to mention that the track contains one of the best bridges Swift has ever written – and yet it was paid dust.
“Getaway Car”
“Getaway Car”
We’ve all seen the iconic video of the song’s bridge being created and the power it holds. The storytelling is a highlight from “Reputation” drawing a clear picture of her jumping into a new relationship in order to escape an old one through the clever imagery of a getaway car.
“I Think He Knows”
“I Think He Knows”
Imagine Swift strutting down the enormous stage while singing “He got my heartbeat skipping down 16th Avenue.” Paired with cute choreography on the chorus, it’s a track that would’ve been legendary.
“the 1”
“the 1”
Though the “Folklore” portion of the tour was the longest out of all the eras, the absence of this song was still felt. The iconic opening line — “I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit” — and the instrumentals which evoke images of a forest, immediately make this song one of her best album openers. Playing at least the first verse and chorus would have made the show just that much better.
“long story short”
“long story short”
The most upbeat song on “evermore” deserved its moment. The drums that start right as the chorus kicks in are phenomenal. Particularly given that “evermore” is one of the more mellow segments of the concert, this song would have been a great way to bring the energy up.
10. “You’re on Your Own, Kid”
Though Swift often leans toward fun pop songs for the closing song on her tours, this song could’ve been an amazing exception. It perfectly encapsulates the concept of the Era’s tour as the song describes Swift’s journey through her career. Singing this song to a stadium of fans and celebrating that she really did give her blood, sweat, and tears for this would have been beautiful.

Mariel Molino is a rising star in the entertainment industry. With experience across both Mexican and American film and television industries, she has taken on various roles, such as Carmen Sandoval in “Promised Land” and Kika in “Muy Padres,” and genres — and now has moved on to her first thriller. In a recent round-table interview, Molino discussed her career, influences, and how the landscape of television streaming is changing.
Molino began her career in Mexico and quickly developed a passion for working in Spanish-language shows and with other Mexican actors.
“I really love getting to work in Mexico because I love speaking in Spanish and working with other fellow Mexican actors and getting to spend time with my family. And I think that Mexico really gave me a lot of opportunities and it's where I was able to really get started in the industry and where I learned a lot of lessons,” Molino said when asked about working in Mexico.
She credits Mexico with providing her with many opportunities and teaching her valuable lessons about the industry, but working in Hollywood had always been her dream — something she has now realized. “The Watchful Eye” is Molino’s first time working in the thriller genre. She started her career in comedy and then moved into drama, which she found helpful in approaching the thriller genre.
She explained how her background in comedy was actually an asset in transitioning to a thriller show.
“And I think that that was kind of a really good spring to go into a thriller because even though I have a lot of background in comedy, you can really use comedy to lighten up a lot of situations, especially the darkest of genres, because you always need just a little bit of light to break up the mood,” Molino said.
Molino discussed how difficult intense, emotional scenes can be, especially when acting alone. One of the biggest challenges she faced in this role was having many scenes where she was alone, reacting to things that weren't actually there. This required a lot of imagination and visualization, as well as learning to use the camera as a co-star. In the show, there is a scene where Elena, Molino’s character, gets trapped in the attic because the secret door, which is hidden in a staircase, falls shut behind her, and her phone is dead due to a blackout. The acting in the scene is very powerful, as it shows Elena feeling fear and panic for the first time instead of her usual stoic nature.
“I really wanted to show a moment that really showed her vulnerability in her failed frailty, and that she was at her wit's end with this whole ordeal. And so that was really challenging because I wanted to be honest, but also not go too crazy,” Molino said.
“The Watchful Eye” provided many new opportunities for Molino including working with co-stars such as Kelly Bishop, best known for her role as Emily Gilmore on “Gilmore Girls.” Bishop served as a big inspiration for Molino as the two worked closely together on the show.
“I think I learned that [Bishop]'s all about the work. She's all the text and knowing the script so well, she's also a theater actor, and so it really is about what's on the page and about following direction, but also coming to set with ideas. And one thing about Kelly Bishop is that she's really, really specific in her work, she’s a comedic genius. Her comedic timing is impeccable. There wasn't one beat that was off, and it was like that take after take after take. So I don't know, I just learned so much from her. And she just has such a great voice too. She commands the room and it was really such a lovely experience to get to work with her,” Molino said.
Molino also discussed the changing landscape of television streaming. She finds it interesting that some shows are now releasing weekly episodes instead of dropping an entire season at once. She believes this can help with fan engagement and bring back the old feeling of anticipating a show. However, she also acknowledges that everyone's viewing habits are different, and there's no right or wrong way to watch a show.
“I’ve had people tell me, you know, I am waiting until all 10 episodes are out because I need to binge it, and, listen, I think to each their own. Your journey is your journey, but I actually, and I am not just saying this because it is my show, I love this format because of exactly what you are talking about, the fan engagement.” said Molino.
Molino's impressive breakthrough role is a testament to the years of hard work and dedication she has put into her craft. Her unwavering commitment to honing her skills has undoubtedly paid off, and this accomplishment serves as a shining example of what can be achieved through perseverance and determination.
“I mean, after this I'm going to acting class because I like to stay in class and challenge myself and never forget to kind of work that muscle out, you know, even if I'm in a show,” Molino said.
Mariel Molino's career in the entertainment industry is a testament to her hard work, dedication, and talent. Her experience working in both the Mexican and American film and television industries has given her a unique perspective on the television industry as a whole. Even as she continues to take on new roles and genres, she remains humble and always seeks to improve as an actor. The changing landscape of television streaming presents new opportunities for engagement, and Molino is excited to see where the industry goes from here. As she continues to evolve as an actor, Molino's future in the entertainment industry looks incredibly bright.

University tuition is high, and it’s been climbing for decades. Listed tuition and fees at both public and private institutions have steadily increased since 2002. Harvard’s price tag for tuition now exceeds $50,000 — then, it was below $25,000.
These exorbitant sticker prices are unaffordable for most families and deter low-income students from applying in the first place.
Many critics stop there, blanching at the announced tuition price and proclaiming an affordability crisis in higher education. A closer look at the data, though, reveals a far more complex story.
Higher sticker prices can actually decrease net costs for some families by increasing available financial aid. And some tuition increases — though not all — are genuine responses to higher costs. Though there are ways to make high-quality education more affordable, the solutions are not as simple as lowering the listed price of tuition.
First, why has tuition increased so much? For public institutions, which educate approximately three out of every four undergraduate students in America, the reason is clear: substantial cuts in state funding.
Since 2001, states have, on average, cut funding for higher education by nearly 18 percent per student. In 2003, just over 30 percent of revenue at public institutions came from tuition. By 2018, it was almost 50 percent. To compensate for the loss of state funding, public universities have, unsurprisingly, had to raise tuition.
For private institutions, the story is more complicated. Indeed, it’s hard to pin price hikes on any one factor in particular, and studies that do often miss the full picture.
For example, some say prices have risen simply because universities have expanded their administrative staff, contributing to “bloat” — wasteful spending that fails to improve educational quality.
To be sure, administrative inefficiencies exist aplenty. But to explain continually rising costs, the bloat theory requires more and more waste each year — a trend not reflected in the data. The administrative share of higher education spending has held relatively constant.
Moreover, university administration is not a vast nebula of useless bureaucrats. In fact, many new administrators include mental health counselors, student advisers, the Title IX office, and IT support staff, among others. Some of these positions are as integral to a thriving student body as instructional faculty and staff.
Ultimately, these new hires are likely only responsible for a small fraction of tuition increases — they don’t explain the massive jumps we’ve been seeing over the past several decades.
Instead, as Harvard dean and professor Bridget Terry Long explained in her testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Finance, tuition growth is “related to a myriad of other internal and external factors.”
For instance, the cost of hiring and retaining teaching staff — especially tenured professors — has skyrocketed. But these increases are not unreasonable; adjusted for inflation, prices for hiring doctors, lawyers, and other similar professionals have risen at similar rates.
In addition, universities now spend more per student on amenities, such as dining services, dormitories, and physical education facilities. They also borrow more money to fund construction ventures and building upgrades.
All these factors and more require private universities to raise tuition sticker prices each year. Thus, it is often simply the case that institutions need more revenue to finance expenditures that they believe will improve the overall educational experience. And institutions can’t offset those necessary expenditures only by trimming administrative fat.
But high price tags might not be so bad, as long as universities redistribute the extra revenue to financial aid for students with more limited means. Last year, Syracuse University, for example, raised tuition by 4.5 percent and increased aid by 9 percent. Princeton announced a new financial aid strategy that eliminates costs for most families earning up to $100,000 a year.
Rather than worrying about listed tuition prices, we should instead focus on the net tuition paid by students in different income brackets post financial aid. Universities should engage in more aggressive price discrimination, shifting from merit-based to need-based aid and forcing the wealthy elite to foot the bill so that low- and middle-income students can attend college functionally for free.
This is what has been happening. In the past ten years, private universities have steadily increased their tuition discounting. As a result, average net tuition has actually decreased. College rankings should factor in the progressiveness of each institution’s aid curve to encourage this trend.
Unfortunately, high sticker prices have an unintended consequence: They deter low- and middle-income students from applying in the first place. Thus, universities should also take steps to advertise how inexpensive they actually are for those students with limited means and make the financial aid process as seamless as possible.
Ultimately, we should focus on the net cost of attending college, not rising sticker prices. For public institutions, it’s up to the government to increase appropriations to decrease student costs. But for private universities, the high-tuition, high-aid model might be the best we can do. If tuition prices must rise, let’s make the most of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday at around noon, my mom texted me.
“Are you in class?”
“No, why?”
Immediately, my phone rang.
My mind sifted through the countless snippets of bad news I could possibly hear when I picked up the phone call. I still wasn’t ready.
“There’s been a shooting at East.”
My heart sank. It wasn’t a hoax this time. Not a “swatting” call. Not a kid with a BB gun. The unthinkable had happened in my former high school — a place that I still see as home. It happened to a community still mourning the death of a classmate, Luis Garcia, who was shot just a block away from school last month.
I scrambled to text my closest friends. For the first time in years, old group chats resurfaced. Within hours, “East High School” was a top 10 trending topic on Twitter in the United States.
According to officials, a student enlisted in a personalized “safety plan” for daily pat-downs had pulled a gun and shot two deans. The presence of paramedics at the school for an unrelated medical emergency may have saved a dean’s life. Ultimately, the shooting ended with one death — the shooter — whom law enforcement says died by apparent suicide far away from school.
At this point, it feels like there’s only so much one can say about this epidemic plaguing our country. We know the statistics. We know that firearms are the leading cause of death for American children and teens. A recent Crimson staff editorial aptly wrote that “We are the Generation of Mass Shootings.”
So, instead, I’ll direct this to East High School students, current and former — to my peers. And in that vein, to all students who have feared for their lives within the confines of their school.
The power and spirit that you hold in the heart of Denver is indomitable.
I remember marching down Colfax Avenue to the state Capitol with hundreds of classmates in March of 2018 to demand more gun control after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High. I remember when our legislators met us at the steps and listened and I remember our teachers cheering us on. I have never felt prouder to be an East Angel than at that moment.
Last month, when Luis was shot, you swiftly came together and fundraised more than $200,000 for his family. You wielded your power with other schools by walking out of class and to the Capitol, filling the chambers with your presence and your voices, calling for change. You lobbied. You made the news. You demanded more from leaders that have failed us for far too long.
And last Friday, the day after Dean Sinclair and Dean Mason were shot, after you once again hid in classrooms, texted loved ones, and were forced to fear for your life, you marched right back, like East Angels do. I would expect no less.
This past week, news of our school graced the New York Times. CNN and Fox News picked up the story, too. People who have never stepped foot in Denver, let alone walked the halls of East, will read the news, judge, generalize, and form every opinion imaginable about our school. Don’t listen to them.
Media and politicians will take these recent tragedies and frame them to fit their narrative. “This is why we need more gun control.” “This is a mental health issue, not a gun issue.” “This wouldn’t have happened if teachers were armed.” “There should have been police in the school.” “This is why you should vote for me for Denver mayor.”
Don’t let the voices of the adults, God forbid the politicians and pundits, drown yours out.
Keep organizing. Be a pain in the ass at the Capitol. Attend school board meetings. Speak at them. Write about what you want to see change within the walls of our high school, because nobody knows it better than you do. Build a culture that encourages the next students after you to do the same.
But please, please, allow yourselves time and space to mourn. Care for each other, for your teachers, and for your administrators. Let the warmth of the community wrap its arms around you in love, support, and solidarity. It will only make you stronger.
In four years or less, high school will be but a patchwork of memories for all of you. It is now for me. From spirited pep rallies, to meeting at the “E” before lunch, to marching down Colfax Avenue, these experiences shaped who I am today.
I can’t even begin to imagine how the last few months have shaped you. Whatever you choose to do next in your life, I urge you: Remember the East Angel spirit. Bring it with you and spread it to the communities within which you find yourselves. Don’t stop wielding your voice and your power, and don’t stop caring for each other.
We are Angels forever.
Dedicated to Luis Garcia, Eric Sinclair, and Jerald Mason.

In a world where division and difference seem to be the defining characteristics of life, finding agreement can sometimes be a daunting task.
Every now and then, however, one figure breaks through dark clouds of discord — and we believe that Harvard has found one of these individuals in its choice for the Class of 2023’s Commencement speaker. A man so beloved that he has acquired the nickname “America’s Dad,” a man so free from controversy that he was named the nation’s most trusted person in 2013, and a genuine charmer that anyone would be proud to bring home to mom and dad: We couldn’t be happier about the Commencement speaker selection of Tom Hanks.
But Forrest Gump is not just a familiar face from the silver screen. He is undeniably a master of his craft, having won two Oscars, six primetime Emmys, five Golden Globes, and 81 other awards for film and television, totaling 94 wins out of 210 nominations, not to mention his accolades from the French Legion of Honor and the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts — plus, of course, his Presidential Medal of Freedom. For a man so decorated for his abilities to deceive audiences into believing his characters are real, Hanks’s near-universal trustworthiness in real life gives us hope that he will inject some much needed veritas into our increasingly fractured reality.
Captain Phillips will also be a refreshing face at an event so often dominated by speakers from the world of business, politics, or academia. While these other distinguished speakers are certainly important, we also must acknowledge that the Commencement address is delivered to the entire Class of 2023, not just students wishing to enter these traditionally Crimson-saturated fields. An address from Hanks to the Class of 2023 represents the true diversity of interests contained within that graduating class, and we hope it will spark the creativity latent within all students — even those not seeking to enter the world of entertainment.
Although Hollywood is often riddled with controversies, we can find a celebrity to emulate in Tom Hanks. Time and time again, when Hanks makes headlines, he is featured for supporting veterans, advocating for AIDS research, or even selling his car for charity.
In recent years, Hanks’ biggest splash in the news occurred when he was one of the first celebrities to test positive for Covid-19, ushering us into a whirlwind era of fear, darkness, and uncertainty. We can think of no better person to speak to the class that was kicked off of campus in 2020, went through online school in 2021, and was only just able to return to a new “normal” in 2022. Woody led us into the pandemic; how poetic is it that he will be the one to lead us out.
Life is like a box of chocolates, and after swallowing so many bitter confections, the Class of 2023 has finally stumbled on a sweet one. We’re glad Tom Hanks is the one they’re gonna get.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and City Councilors Marc C. McGovern and Burhan Azeem are developing a policy order aimed at expanding after-school care, following more than a year of advocacy by Cambridge Public Schools parents.
The proposed changes, first presented in a February meeting of the council’s Human Services and Veterans Committee, would expand the city’s childcare after-school programs by 170 seats in the 2023-24 school year.
Cambridge’s Department of Human Service Programs currently offers 20 of the city’s 27 elementary after-school programs. Despite high demand from working parents in Cambridge, the city only provides enough space for roughly half of the eligible children in the city — with a ratio of 710 slots to 1,378 students.
Eugenia B. Schraa ’04, a CPS parent and former Crimson editor, said she was inspired to advocate for expanded after-school services after a difficult personal experience with the city’s current program.
After navigating the “really confusing” process of enrollment in 2022, Schraa said she decided to write a blog post for other parents to spread information about how to register.
“I got flooded with lots of parents being like, ‘Thank you, this is so helpful,’” Schraa said of the response to her post. “Then, I got a lot of parents being like, ‘We need you to help us advocate; there’s not enough seats.’”
After this realization, Schraa said she worked alongside CPS parent Amanda Beatty to advocate for expanded after-school care, meeting with McGovern and City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 to discuss the issue. Beatty and Schraa also circulated a petition to improve after-school care, which Schraa said had nearly 500 signatures as of Thursday.
The petition calls on the Department of Human Service Programs to create enough space so that every child who wants to attend the program is guaranteed a spot, to prioritize low-income students if spots continue to be limited, and to create an information dashboard on program opening and waitlist numbers.
The petition also asks the department to coordinate with CPS to ensure student transportation to after-school programs by bus or with walking accompaniment, or through “any other safe means.”
“We don’t want magic, we don’t expect something unachievable of the city — but we do expect them to be taking it really seriously and have a plan to achieve significant change,” Schraa said.
A pre-pandemic survey of Massachusetts parents by the Afterschool Alliance found that for every child enrolled in an after-school program, three more are unable to access them. Cambridge, having a higher average than the state and national level, currently enrolls 42 percent of elementary students in its after-school programs.
During the February meeting, Michelle Farnum, an assistant director at the department, said the primary obstacle to after-school expansion is staffing shortages. Farnum said childcare providers have struggled to recover from a workforce decline sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Particularly in Massachusetts, we have not fully recovered to our pre-pandemic rate,” she said. “Our recovery rate is less than other areas around the country.”
A national survey conducted by the Afterschool Alliance in spring 2022 found that 69 percent of childcare providers are extremely or very concerned about hiring shortages in spring 2022.
“This is not a Cambridge problem; it’s not even a Massachusetts problem,” Farnum said. “Still in 2022, providers of after-school care continue to be impacted by the staffing shortage.”
To support the existing program providers, the city’s proposal extends their temporary agency contracts to meet their fall 2023 expansion goals. The city would also promote high-performing temporary workers to permanent employees and partner with external recruiting firms to find additional full-time staff.
McGovern, who is working on the proposal, said “there’s still some back and forth going on” in finalizing the policy order, but added that he hopes it will soon come before the council.
The new policy order, according to McGovern, would direct the city manager to craft a three-year plan to improve the after-school program. The plan would seek to address issues including staffing, space, transportation, and special education, he said.
During the February meeting, Huang said that the city is “on the right track,” but needs to make decisions on how to make the best out of the city’s “scarce resource” of after-school childcare.
“I know that we’re still going to have many people on the waitlist and that it will really affect people and families and working parents,” Huang said. “I think there’s continued conversations for us to make sure that we’re grappling with this.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he is excited to see the city’s initiatives “after years of demands from hundreds of caregivers.”
“Expanded slots for Fall 2023 is only the beginning,” he wrote. “I look forward to the expansion of the proven King Open Extended Day model as soon as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal judge denied Harvard’s motion for summary judgment on one of the counts of a lawsuit filed last year by three Anthropology graduate students who alleged the University failed to properly handle years of sexual harassment and retaliation reports against professor John L. Comaroff.
U.S. District Court Judge Judith G. Dein denied Harvard’s motion to rule in its favor without a trial on the last of 10 counts in the lawsuit, which alleges that Harvard violated the law by obtaining and disseminating the therapy notes of one of the plaintiffs, Lilia M. Kilburn.
The tenth count, on behalf of Kilburn, alleges Harvard breached fiduciary duty and illegally invaded Kilburn’s privacy by obtaining Kilburn’s private therapy records from a non-Harvard therapist and sharing them with Comaroff.
Harvard says Kilburn encouraged the University’s Office for Dispute Resolution to obtain these records and knew they would be shared with Comaroff as part of Harvard’s Title IX investigation process. The two parties argued over the matter in filings last fall.
In a 23-page ruling, Dein wrote that the facts of the case were not clear enough to merit summary judgment, adding the “facts are sufficient at this stage” to “support” Kilburn’s claim that Harvard’s actions constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.
Dein also wrote that Kilburn was “entitled” to “sufficient time and opportunity for discovery.”
“This court concludes that the extent of Ms. Kilburn’s consent is unclear and in dispute, and that this issue must await further development of the record,” Dein wrote. “Harvard is relying on ambiguous documents and disputed oral conversations that have been untested by discovery.”
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the ruling.
The University also asked Dein to dismiss counts one through nine of the lawsuit, which detail the plaintiffs’ allegations of Harvard’s indifference to complaints of sexual harassment and professional retaliation. The motion for dismissal of these counts is still pending an order from the judge.
Kilburn, Margaret G. Czerwienski, and Amulya Mandava, three graduate students in Harvard’s Department of Anthropology, originally sued Harvard last February, saying the University’s “deliberate indifference” allowed Comaroff to assault Kilburn and retaliate against Mandava and Czerwienski.
“All three Plaintiffs repeatedly complained to Harvard administrators,” the February filing said. “But the University brushed them aside and opted to protect its star professor over vulnerable students.”
Comaroff has repeatedly denied all allegations of harassment and retaliation made against him.
After the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint in June with further instances of alleged sexual harassment during Comaroff’s tenure at the University of Chicago, Harvard resubmitted its motions to dismiss counts one through nine and for summary judgment of count ten in July.
In a memorandum supporting the motion for summary judgment, Harvard argued that Kilburn had consented to the ODR contacting and interviewing her therapist directly when she told the ODR verbally in an August 2020 meeting that the therapist “should have a bunch of notes or memories” corroborating her account of Comaroff’s behavior.
In a response to the motion, Kilburn’s attorneys argued Harvard failed to obtain necessary written authorization from Kilburn to access her medical records and took Kilburn’s “ambiguous” remarks as “license to obtain full psychotherapy progress notes from two private sessions.”
On Monday, Dein described Harvard’s arguments as “unpersuasive.”
“The record amply supports a finding that Harvard knew or should have known that Ms. Kilburn’s therapist required written, specific authorization before she was able to release personal medical information,” Dein wrote.
“There is also evidence, even at this pre-discovery stage, that Harvard should have known that the therapist did not have the authorization she required, but that ODR nevertheless interviewed the therapist at some length and obtained information which went beyond anything that Ms. Kilburn had said the therapist could provide,” Dein added.
In an emailed statement, attorneys Russell L. Kornblith, Sean R. Ouellette ’12, and Carolin Guentert, who represent the three graduate students, wrote they were “heartened” by the judge’s ruling.
“Harvard knew or at least should have known that interviewing Ms. Kilburn’s therapist and asking for her medical records required written, specific consent, yet Harvard failed to get that consent,” they wrote. “Students have the right to access their school’s Title IX process without fearing that the school will obtain their private medical information and disclose it to their harasser without their consent.”
In a statement, Ruth K. O’Meara-Costello ’02, an attorney for Comaroff, wrote that the professor is not a party to the lawsuit and did not take a position on Harvard’s motion for summary judgment.
Comaroff “disputes Ms. Kilburn’s characterization of his participation and statements in ODR’s process,” O’Meara-Costello wrote.
“Discovery in this case will reveal that he did not sexually harass or retaliate against any of the plaintiffs,” she added.
The Department of Justice submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the plaintiffs in September, arguing that Harvard could still be held liable for allegations that Comaroff retaliated against the students who warned others of his alleged misconduct.
Allegations against Comaroff were first publicized in a 2020 investigation by The Crimson. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay — who was elected as the University’s 30th president last December — put Comaroff on paid administrative leave shortly afterward, before placing him on unpaid leave.
Comaroff returned to teaching in the fall 2022 semester, prompting a student walkout and a protest by Harvard’s graduate student union. A similar protest followed this spring, with more than 100 students participating in a walkout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Local undergraduates are developing an app to connect Greater Boston’s unhoused population to essential resources, with hopes to launch in the coming weeks.
The app — known as “Alliance for the Homeless” or “Allforth,” for short — will use a map to display food, shelter, and medical resources offered at different locations in a user’s vicinity.
Benjamin Chang ’23-’24, the team’s executive director, said his experience working at Y2Y — a student-run shelter for unhoused young adults in Harvard Square — motivated him to develop the app.
“There are a lot of resources out there for the homeless community in Boston and Cambridge, and the shelters have a lot of information about it,” Chang said. “But something that I noticed was that a lot of the homeless guests that we had did not actually have access to the information, even though it was online.”
Chang said an app is an efficient way to reach the unhoused population and provide them with personalized information, citing his own observation that many Y2Y guests own a cellphone.
“We have a bunch of data from the Y2Y as well as different homeless shelters in the area, so we’re just compiling that data and putting it onto a map to make it more accessible to the homeless community here in Boston,” Allforth Director of Resources Harold Peón Castro ’25 said.
In his research for Allforth, Peón Castro — a director at HSHS, another student-run unhoused shelter in Harvard Square — said he discovered that an app with a centralized set of resources for unhoused people does not exist in Boston.
“I was surprised to research and find that there doesn’t really exist an app that’s done this before — a centralized directory for the resources here in Boston, or really a model that’s scalable to other cities, which I think is something that Ben has thought about doing further down the line,” Peón Castro said, referring to Chang.
Chang offered community fridges as an example of a resource that Allforth plans to include in its app.
“Harold’s found over 20 community fridges just in the Boston, Cambridge area,” Chang said, referring to Peón Castro. “What is the point of an amazing resource like that if it’s not being utilized by the people who need it the most?”
Chang said the response to his initial email recruiting interested students for app development was “inspiring,” adding he received “double digit sign-ups within an hour.” Allforth’s team comprises both students from a variety of concentrations at Harvard and from other local universities such as Tufts and Boston University, according to Chang.
“I think it’s great that we’re able to actually connect the people who want to help also with the people who need this help,” he added.
As for the team environment, Director of Engineering Kushal Chattopadhyay ’25 described the technical side as “collaborative,” with tasks being delegated to individuals “from different angles, but all of it coming together at the very end.”
Chang said once the app is released, it would be relatively easy to expand the app’s reach to include unhoused populations in other regions worldwide.
“We are potentially thinking about scaling this up to other high-need areas around the country or around the world,” Chang said.
“Once you have the platform, you can just add more data, and you can connect people with resources wherever there is location data for it,” Chang added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 300 students and professionals gathered at the Harvard Undergraduate Venture Capital Group’s inaugural Entrepreneurship Summit Sunday afternoon.
Hosted in the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, the conference featured a variety of VC firms and startups, 15 panels, and two networking sessions. The event attracted a range of attendees from around Boston, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and working professionals.
HUVCG Co-President Edbert Wu ’24 and Director of the Entrepreneurship Summit Michael Oved ’25 opened the conference by introducing the group’s history.
“We were founded in 2018,” Wu said. “And back then, we only had about 10 people. Now we’re proud to say we have over 40 members on board positions, 500 startups in our network, and over 50 VC firms that we have relationships with.”
The first keynote address was a conversation between Steve Fredette and Sarah C. Leary ’92. Fredette is the co-founder of Toast, a restaurant management software company. Leary is the co-founder of Nextdoor, a private social network for neighborhoods.
Fredette shared his early entrepreneurial experience in college when his company, Wickedparty.com, competed with the beginnings of Facebook.
“We had 20,000, 30,000 different college students across the city. And then when Facebook came out, it just spread way faster,”’ Fredette said. “It was a much better brand.”
Leary touched on her career path after graduating from Harvard as an Economics concentrator. Instead of entering investment banking or consulting, Leary chose to work at Microsoft, still a small company at the time.
“I think one of the most important things from that experience was the quality of the people that you work with,” Leary said. “I met incredible people who understood how to start companies, how to build them, and formed the type of tight bonds that you have in your working relationships.”
In a series of panels, experts covered topics ranging from launching startups to adopting a growth mindset. Jadyn K. Bryden ’21, vice president at VC firm XFund, discussed the growing interest of investors in non-technical founders.
“We support lateral thinkers,” she said in reference to XFund.
“You don’t need to be a CS major to be a good founder,” Bryden added.
Attendee Mani A. Chadaga ’25 said his hope in attending conferences like these is “to get inspired by bigger entrepreneurs.”
“We were just talking about some gems to take at Harvard to free up more time to do startups,” Chadaga said of his conversations with conference attendees.
The summit also attracted students from beyond the College.
Edwin Yang, a freshman at Northeastern studying electrical and computer engineering, said he learned about the event from the university’s Business and Innovative Technologies Club. Yang also said he had a chance to ask Fredette, the co-founder of Toast, about “building a brand and e-commerce.”
Sunday’s 6.5-hour conference also featured two networking sessions for attendees to interact over beverages and hors d’oeuvres.
“Our thanks go out to all our speakers, sponsors, and of course, our team members for making the event as successful as it was," Oved wrote in an emailed statement Sunday night.

The Harvard Undergraduate Association gathered for its weekly meeting Sunday, marking the first meeting since new leadership took office this month.
Officers and co-presidents, who were elected by the student body on Feb. 21, discussed goals for their tenure and introduced themselves to attendees during the meeting. The HUA — now led by Co-Presidents John S. Cooke ’25 and Shikoh Misu Hirabayashi ’24 — is entering its second year as the College’s student government after students voted in 2022 to dismantle the previous body, the Undergraduate Council.
Cooke opened the meeting by calling for volunteers to serve under the recently elected officers. He also announced open executive positions, including a communications director and a technological director.
Cooke also said his administration will emphasize the importance of “academic freedom,” especially around secondary fields of study.
“That means double secondaries. That means putting your secondaries on your degree,” Cooke said. “As it stands right now, the secondaries aren’t on your degree when you graduate and we want to have that present.”
Hirabayashi said his and Cooke’s administration will advocate for greater religious and athletic accommodations for students.
“A lot of athletes have really mentioned how they can’t reschedule an exam or they can’t attend a class,” Hirabayashi said. “Same for religious reasons as well, where students email the professor and the professor is very strict about a certain deadline or a certain exam.”
The finance team, led by Co-Treasurers Josh A. Kaplan ’26 and Corbin C. Lubianski ’24, shared plans to streamline the grant application process and work toward a goal of getting the student activities fee covered by financial aid.
While the newly established Inclusion Team has not yet received an allocation from the HUA’s budget, they may draw funds from other teams if deemed necessary, Lubianski said.
Sports Officer May Olibale ’25, who was not present at the meeting, plans to focus on adding written guidelines to the Harvard College Student Handbook about accommodations for athletics-related absences, Cooke said.
Her other goals for the term include adding new physical therapy equipment to training rooms, subsidizing sports-related health care costs for athletes, and investing in additional athletic trainers.
Academic Officer Peter E. Chon ’26 said he aims to facilitate the academic transition from high school to college by expanding the resources available for freshmen in large introductory courses and increasing their pre-professional advising opportunities.
“As a first-year, I have a lot of thoughts about this,” Chon said. “One of them would definitely be having pre-professional advising towards first-years, something similar maybe to the resident tutor system for upperclassmen.”
“Another thing would be that maybe all the department websites can have something like sample course schedules for your concentrations,” he added.
Residential Life Officer Hamza T. Masoud ’26 also discussed his priorities for his tenure, including supplying free hand soap for en suite bathrooms, extending dining hall hours, and expanding halal, kosher, and vegan options.
Masoud said he also hopes to add hot breakfast options to a dining hall located in the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Last semester, nearly 2,000 students advocated for hot breakfast in all upperclassmen houses.
The HUA plans to hold regular meetings Sundays at 5 p.m. in Smith Campus Center’s Riverview Commons room.

Journalists and filmmakers discussed the challenges of covering the war in Ukraine ethically while also portraying the reality of the conflict at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday evening.
Moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor of the practice Nancy R. Gibbs, the talk featured PBS FRONTLINE Editor-in-Chief Raney Aronson-Rath, Associated Press Global Investigations Editor Alison F. Kodjak, and AP correspondent Erika Kinetz.
The talk was co-sponsored by HKS’ Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy and ​​the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Gibbs, director of the Shorenstein Center and the former editor-in-chief for TIME Magazine, began the event by discussing the obstacles journalists face during wartime.
“They run towards the explosions,” Gibbs said. “The toll is not just on physical safety; it is hard to be immersed in other people’s acute suffering and not be able to do anything.”
Kinetz, who has reported on the ground in Ukraine for the last year, said there is a “healing” component to wartime journalism by empowering people to take a role in the conflict.
“I think a lot of people, especially Ukrainians, are happy to be able to do something,” Kinetz said. “There’s some kind of relief that comes from participating in a process where you are bearing witness to something.”
Kodjak said there is often an “internal debate” within newsrooms on deciding how much and what to show audiences.
“I am a person who believes that war is hideous and awful and that we shouldn’t hide that from people,” Kodjak said, but added that “there’s no right answer” to the question.
PBS FRONTLINE and the Associated Press have collaborated on War Crimes Watch Ukraine, an effort to document and verify war crimes throughout the conflict.
Kinetz, who helped establish the effort, said that for their documentary on Bucha, her team obtained roughly 2,000 intercepted phone calls and 80,000 videos.
Kinetz said it was important to independently verify the evidence, explaining that her team “put a lot of effort into the due diligence of these materials” to avoid the “manipulation of media.”
According to Kinetz, the AP has a team in charge of verifying the videos to ensure they “were really showing what corresponded to the actual streets of Bucha.” They also worked with an investigative group in London to verify the identities of the Russian soldiers who were making those phone calls.
“That took a lot of time and institutional commitment,” Kinetz said.
Aronson-Rath said that the monthslong process of creating a documentary is a “privilege” because it provides time to think through the “humanizing” aspects of these decisions and obtain consent from individuals shown in the film.
Kinetz brought up a conversation she had with a woman who discovered her husband was dead through an online post.
“These choices are hugely consequential to people,” Kinetz said.
Kinetz said that while there is “right and wrong here,” the public should not view filmmakers and journalists as “prosecutors” of war crimes, adding that their role is instead to document what they observe.
“As long as it’s in the public domain, it’s accessible to prosecutors,” Kinetz said. “I think the rule is, just publish as much as you can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s women’s ice hockey program has come under scrutiny this year following investigations by the Boston Globe and the Athletic, prompting the eighth major review surrounding Harvard Athletics since 2016.
Harvard Athletics’ decision to retain an external investigator to review the program in the wake of allegations against embattled women’s ice hockey coach Katey Stone is the first time since 2019 that a Harvard coach’s conduct has been investigated by an outside group.
The women’s hockey program will face an investigation by New York-based law firm Jenner and Block, led by attorney Katya Jestin, who specializes in culture investigations. Athletic Director Erin McDermott announced the external review in a March 14 email to student athletes.
In past scandals within Harvard Athletics programs, coach behavior and team culture have been reviewed by University bodies — such as the Office of General Counsel or the Title IX office — or independent investigators.
Harvard Athletics and its affiliates have faced several major reviews in recent years, five of which involved external investigators.
Former men’s fencing coach Peter Brand underwent an independent investigation in April 2019, which found him in violation of Harvard’s conflict of interest policy.
The investigation centered on the 2016 sale of his home to Jie “Jack” Zhao, father of two recruited Harvard fencers, for “well over” its assessed market value. Zhao also donated $1 million to the National Fencing Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit which that year donated $100,000 to a new nonprofit formed by Brand.
Brand was subsequently dismissed from Harvard, but he was acquitted of federal bribery charges during a jury trial in December 2022.
The 2012 men’s soccer team was reviewed by the Office of General Counsel in 2016 for its annual tradition of producing “sexually explicit scouting reports” of the incoming women’s soccer freshman class.
Following The Crimson’s reporting of the document which ranked women based on appearance and assigned hypothetical sexual positions to each player, Harvard’s Office of General Counsel conducted “an immediate review” at the request of then-University president Drew G. Faust.
The remainder of the team’s 2016 season was canceled following the review.
In 2012, shortly after the men’s soccer “scouting report” was made public, The Crimson reported a similar practice by the men’s cross country team, in which male athletes created spreadsheets featuring sexual comments about women on the cross country team.
Former Athletic Director Robert L. Scalise requested a review of the program by the Office of General Counsel. The team was placed on “athletic probation” following the conclusion of the review, which found that the team did not try to “denigrate or objectify particular women.”
Consultants from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports conducted a department-wide investigation in 2017 after the dual scandals, but its results were not made public.
Patrick Wales-Dinan, a former women’s cross country team coach, faced scrutiny in 2017 for accusations that he fostered “a culture characterized by an expectation of total devotion, unhealthy training habits, and deep divisions about the direction of the program.”
Concerns over his behavior were brought to Harvard Athletics staff, the College’s Title IX Office, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Scalise, the program’s faculty fellows, Faculty of Arts and Sciences human resources employees, and at least one external investigator.
Wales-Dinan stepped down in June 2017 after three years as coach of the distance running program.
In 2017, The Crimson reported allegations of unequal treatment of women’s rugby team members. Players alleged that they did not receive equitable support from Harvard Athletics, specifically raising concerns around recruiting spots and coach compensation.
The complaints led to involvement from representatives of Harvard’s Office of Human Resources after players reached out to Faust and Scalise on multiple occasions.
In November 2016, Alexandra D. Thaler — an attorney at Bello/Welsh LLP specializing in labor and employment law — was hired to review Harvard Athletics’ treatment of the program. A few months later, Janet P. Judge ’85 was hired as an external investigator to review gender and pay equity in the Athletics Department.
An April 2017 Crimson investigation found that coaches of men’s athletics teams earned “significantly more money” than coaches of women’s teams.
Harvard Athletics was most recently reviewed from 2019 to 2020.
The review was announced shortly after the dismissal of Brand, the fencing coach who violated Harvard’s conflict of interest policies. Still, FAS Dean Claudine Gay said the review, conducted by outside consulting firm Mercer, was “unrelated” to Brand’s firing.
The review found that many athletics staff members and student-athletes feel a disconnect from the FAS, despite Harvard Athletics falling under the jurisdiction of the body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outgoing Harvard Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister said in a Thursday interview that the University should be “very cautious” in its financial management as it confronts an increasingly uncertain economic climate.
The United States is currently facing an array of economic challenges, including record-high inflation levels, rising interest rates, recent bank failures, and stock market volatility. During the interview, Hollister said these challenges, which he called a “quadruple whammy,” will affect Harvard’s financial results in the coming years.
“There are storm clouds: Inflation is very clear and present and revealing in construction costs, supplies, services, everywhere,” Hollister said. “Capital market difficulties, bank failures, rising interest rates, and the fear, of course, upon the present — fear of a recession — so it’s time to be very cautious.”
Hollister also said current-use donations so far this fiscal year are “running behind last year.”
“Whether that’s a certain indication that the economy is softening, we don’t know yet. It’s also the year trend – we’re not sure how it will play out,” he said.
Hollister added the financial headwinds will “inevitably” affect Harvard’s endowment returns for fiscal year 2023, “and therefore the endowment’s capacity to make distributions in the next few years in the budget.”
Last fall, Harvard reported a $2.3 billion loss in endowment value for fiscal year 2022 — its first year of negative returns since 2016. Still, the University’s financial report for the last fiscal year cautioned that the reported endowment value, $50.9 billion, may not accurately reflect the current market value of the endowment’s assets due to uncertainty surrounding the valuation of private equity and venture capital investments.
Hollister said the recent financial turmoil has made it even more difficult to estimate the value of private assets in Harvard’s endowment.
“The recent disruption in both venture capital and startup funding as well as bank failures has no doubt further exacerbated the question of what is the proper valuation for certain classes of assets,” he said.
Despite financial challenges, Hollister said Harvard is “fortunate” to have entered fiscal year 2023 in a “sound financial condition.” Harvard reported a $406 million surplus at the end of fiscal year 2022 — its highest in at least the last two decades.
The Thursday interview marked Hollister’s final interview with The Crimson. Harvard announced last November that Hollister would retire at the end of the academic year after serving as the school’s CFO for eight years.
Hollister is credited with preparing Harvard well for financial challenges resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, Hollister led recession planning with financial teams across the University to ensure the school was well-prepared for future economic downturns.
Reflecting on his tenure, Hollister said it is critical for Harvard to remain prepared to weather economic turmoil.
“Harvard in its almost 400 year history has seen many ups and downs, and we’ve certainly seen some of those in the last seven or eight years,” Hollister said. “Staying watchful, being prepared, maintaining sound financial footing were important most recently and in years ahead.”
Hollister’s retirement will coincide with that of University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who will be succeeded by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay in July. Hollister said he was “thrilled” by Gay’s selection.
“I’ve had the opportunity to work with Claudine closely and think she’s terrific,” Hollister said. “One disappointment is that I will not have the chance to work with her or work under her leadership in the years ahead.”
During the presidential search, Hollister said he provided input on the “working relationship” between the CFO and Harvard’s top administrators: president, provost, and executive vice president.
Hollister said he looks forward to new endeavors following his retirement from Harvard.
“It has been a privilege to work at a place with such a worthy mission and so many interesting and dedicated people,” Hollister said. “But I have family, friends, adventures, and hopefully new chapters of contribution that I look forward to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Acting on what they described as a gap in advocacy opportunities on campus, Harvard undergraduates are seeking to promote LGBTQ+ rights and activism through a new group, Harvard Undergraduate Queer Advocates.
The group started when current board members and founders met last year during Visitas, an annual event which brings newly admitted students to campus in April to learn more about Harvard and meet other accepted students.
In founding the new group, the students were united in their common interest in advancing queer advocacy at Harvard. HUQAD aims to empower and advocate for LGBTQ+ people on campus and in the greater Boston area.
Oliver J. Slayton ’26, co-director of communications and a founding member of HUQAD, said the group’s founders felt there “wasn’t quite an organization centered around advocacy”.
Neha Kalra ’26, the vice president of HUQAD, said the group’s meetings grew organically out of a desire to collaborate on shared projects.
“It started with very informal meetings in the Science Center cafe once a week at night on Wednesdays,” Kalra said.
Kalra added that there was no leadership structure at the time — an arrangement they described as “flat leadership.”
“People really came not because they were obligated to, but because they just really had a passion for this organization,” they said.
The group’s current focus is on gender-inclusive bathrooms. Referencing the “strenuous laws around going to the bathroom that aligns with your sex assigned at birth,” Slayton said “bathrooms have become highly politicized recently.”
“All of a sudden, there is so much social pressure in the choice of which restroom you’re walking into,” they added. “And not only social pressure, but now political pressure depending on where you are.”
Kalra said the project on gender-inclusive bathrooms has entailed extensive research and collaborations with other organizations.
Amber M. Simons ’26, one of the co-presidents of HUQAD, said they hope to expand the advocacy work done by the group beyond the campus and into the Boston area, collaborating with other organizations. Simons also said the group aims to “empower” others to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ people.
Slayton said the “number one goal” of the organization is to make “the queer humans around us face a little bit less strain in their day-to-day life.”
Klarna said the organization aims to teach students to become more civically and politically engaged.
“We really want to enable everyone who does care about making a difference to be able to have the resources and knowledge to do so,” they said.
Slayton said the group seeks to be a space for individuals from all walks of life to come together to advance a common goal.
“It’s just a space for students, whether they’re queer or not, to come and make the world a better place day by day,” they said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Setti D. Warren has been named the permanent director of the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School, removing his interim title effective immediately, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced Tuesday morning.
The unexpected July 2022 departure of former IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 — who returned to Hobart and William Smith Colleges to serve a second shift as president — prompted a national search for a successor.
Warren’s appointment concludes a search that narrowed in on four finalists: former U.S. Representative Val V. Demings, former Transportation Secretary Anthony R. Foxx, former U.S. Representative Stephanie N. Murphy, and Warren. Following student interviews with candidates, Warren was perceived as a viable middle-of-the-pack candidate, before emerging as Elmendorf’s selection.
“I am delighted that Setti Warren has accepted the position of IOP Director,” Elmendorf said in the press release. “With his commitment to Harvard’s students and his dedication to working with them, the future of the IOP is very bright.”
Warren served as mayor of Newton, Massachusetts, from 2010 to 2018, before joining HKS as a senior leader where he was executive director of the IOP and the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. Warren was named interim director of the IOP in July 2022, following Gearan’s departure.
“I am honored to have the opportunity to lead this important and storied institution,” Warren said in the press release.
The IOP, one of the largest student organizations for undergraduates, was established in 1966 as a memorial to President John F. Kennedy ’40. The IOP aims to inspire undergraduates to engage with public service and politics through its 15 student programs.
“President Kennedy once said, ‘It is time for a new generation of leadership to cope with the new problems and new opportunities. For there is a new world to be won,’” Warren said in the release. “Building upon the President’s legacy, I look forward to working with students to ensure the IOP inspires young people to get into public service and make a difference in the United States and around the globe.”
Warren’s selection was well received, concluding a selection process that consulted HKS affiliates, IOP student leaders, and the IOP Senior Advisory Committee.
“Our members and student leaders look forward to continuing to work with him and each other in empowering and educating the next generation of public servants through mentorship, accessibility, and collaboration across the Harvard community and beyond,” IOP President Amen H. Gashaw ’24 said in the press release.
IOP Senior Advisory Committee Chair Michael A. Nutter described Warren as the “right leader at the right time” in the release.
“I have known Setti for a long time and continue to admire his leadership,” Nutter said.
Warren also holds a background in military service and politics on the national level. He served as a U.S. Naval intelligence specialist for nine years, White House liaison under the Clinton administration, and deputy state director and communications director for former U.S. Secretary of State and U.S. Senator John Kerry.
“Setti’s a public citizen, exceptionally well-suited to work that brings people together, defies partisan labels, and contributes to a stronger social fabric,” Kerry said in the release. “That’s exactly who he has been in and out of uniform, and who he will be in this new responsibility at a storied institution”
Gashaw praised Warren’s nine-month tenure as the program’s interim director.
“Setti Warren has played a large role in shaping the IOP’s student experience and building it into an increasingly inclusive and innovative space,” Gashaw said.

So you just got into Harvard. Congrats! But if you’re really meant for Harvard, you should know that every moment, including opening your admission letter, is an opportunity to capitalize on your past successes. Enjoy the moment with your family and friends? Reflect on your successes and let yourself feel proud of what you’ve accomplished? Ha! No, you need to post a reaction video and get those sweet, sweet TikTok views. Here’s how to make it happen.
Choose your approach ahead of time
There are three categories of acceptance video: shock, yelling, or crying. Shock is gender-neutral, whereas the crying tends to be women and yelling tends to be men. But who knows, this could be your year to break the glass ceiling. Regardless, you have to practice in advance to make sure you have the most shareable shock/yell/cry. A tip from my long-gone theater kid days: mint chapstick under the eyes will get the tears to come quick.
Make your most emotive friend or family member stand behind you in the frame
Does your mom cry at commercials? Did your brother punch a wall when the Patriots didn’t make it to the Superbowl? Did your bestie jump really high when she was prom-posed to? Good. Put them in the background of the video to really play up the emotion of the moment. And don’t tell them beforehand that you already know you got in, so you can get their genuine reactions.
Remember to say that Harvard is your dream school
Harvard. Is. Everyone’s. Dream. School. And don’t you forget it.
Choose one of the following background songs:
“I Did It All” by Vince Myers. The ending of “Chiquitita” by ABBA. “Perfect Day” by Hoku (because of “Legally Blonde”). “Dies Irae” from Verdi’s Requiem.
SEO optimization
Make sure to include the following tags in the description: #harvard #harvard2027 #collegeacceptance #cambridgemassachusetts #cokescholar #whatlikeitshard #crimson #flybyblog
I hope you utilize these tips. When I was a prefrosh, I didn’t yet understand how to commodify every aspect of my life. So, alas, my acceptance went unposted. Now I write snarky articles on Flyby to try to make up for all that attention I missed out on. Don’t be like me. Go get that publicity. See you at Visitas.
