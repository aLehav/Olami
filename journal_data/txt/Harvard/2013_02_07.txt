After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"I’ll see you at the bill-signing,” President George W. Bush told reporters, referring to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, a bipartisan effort to fix the United States’ broken immigration system. But the signing never came. Instead, the bill died in the House of Representatives, and millions of undocumented workers remained in the shadows.
Now, seven years later, our country faces a similar opportunity for positive change: A group of eight senators, four Democrats and four Republicans, recently announced a plan to draft comprehensive immigration reform legislation by March and bring it to a vote before Congress’s summer recess. On the heels of their announcement, President Obama unveiled his own blueprint for reform. Although it is heartening to see Congress and the White House heading in the same direction, President Obama’s vision for reform has a leg up on the Senate’s. Most importantly, the President’s plan more immediately addresses the needs of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.
Those who argue that legalizing immigrants would hurt American workers and taxpayers are misguided in their beliefs. In reality, an immigration overhaul that strengthens border security, minimizes hiring of undocumented workers, and streamlines legal immigration, while opening a pathway to full citizenship for undocumented workers already in the U.S., could solve a host of problems for current citizens and foreigners alike.
For one thing, many businesses knowingly hire undocumented workers well below the minimum wage, allowing them to turn a higher profit than businesses that play by the rules. This harms law-abiding companies, the middle class, and the economy as a whole. What’s more, many immigrants study in universities where they earn skills that could help the economy flourish, and then have no other option but to turn around and head back home—doubtless many students at Harvard fit this bill. Often, these students create new, exciting industries abroad, industries that end up bolstering the economies of our competitors when they could have strengthened our own.
Both President Obama and the senators pushing for immigration reform recognize these facts, but the senators seek to delay immigrants from applying for permanent citizenship until the government has taken steps to stem additional immigration—like securing the border, implementing systems to track visas, and checking the legal status of workers. Under the Senate plan, immigrants could immediately gain provisional legal status if they met national security and criminal background checks and paid back taxes and a fine. But afterwards, they would remain in a state of limbo for who knows how long, ineligible for federal benefits like health care subsidies. President Obama, on the other hand, would allow immigrants who had been granted provisional legal status the ability to embark on the road to full citizenship right away.
The President’s approach makes far more sense than the Senate’s. First off, it will be a long while till our border is anywhere near completely secure. This, coupled with the time it will take for the existing immigration backlogs to clear, may cause many immigrants not to see citizenship in their lifetimes. Besides, it seems unfair to name a group of people legal U.S. residents and then not allow them to become citizens on the same terms as everyone else. After all, efforts to secure the border are irrelevant when dealing with immigrants who have already crossed it—it is not as if people who are living here illegally are reaping the benefits of more immigrants entering. If we plan to legalize undocumented residents, we should not hold their rights to become full citizens hostage to policy initiatives that are out of their control and that do not change their own lives or legal status.
President Bush may have said, “I’ll see you at the bill-signing,” but another (perhaps greater) president once called the United States “a nation of immigrants.” Today, we should remember John F. Kennedy’s words. We should remember that we are all descended from immigrants, even if our ancestors traveled here on the Mayflower. We should remember that our country grew to become the most powerful in the world not in spite of, but because of the people who came from abroad to make it great. And in that spirit, let us hope for comprehensive immigration reform that will give undocumented residents a real chance to make it even greater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It began with a kind of ache—throbbing, persistent. It was a “down” period like those I’d had before, except that the “down” now crept into the rest of each day, each week, until it became my new normal. It was mental, at first; “I just think too much,” I would joke to my parents. “I have to stop thinking so big.”
Shortly into the semester, though, it spread. It became physical: panic attacks came in debilitating waves, tears threatened to pierce any conversation. I would sit curled up at the corner of my bed and the wall, knees to my chest, shaking. I would try to sleep but couldn’t. Everything took longer. I had readings to do and papers to write, but they were to be done alone, and when I was alone I could let myself crumble.
During these months, it was somehow very important to me that no one knew this was happening. I spent less and less time with people, less and less time outside my room, so I had the strength to pretend everything was fine the few hours I was not alone. I cried into my pillow so my roommates wouldn’t hear. I would sit in history lecture as a panic attack came on and blink back tears, terrified that someone would notice. I wondered how everyone but me was so fine. Knowing I needed to spend time away, I applied to study abroad, which would elicit fewer questions than “taking time off.” I continued to isolate myself, which made me feel worse, which led to further isolation: It was a vicious cycle. I had never felt so alone.
If there’s anything this past year has taught me, it is how wrong I was. I was not alone. I am not alone. It is heartbreaking that it has taken, in part, two student suicides to realize this. Harvard, I think, is realizing it too. Along with such tragedies, the past year has witnessed emerging sources of hope: a Kirkland House discussion with President Drew G. Faust during which students raised questions on mental health; a suicide panel of student and recent alumni voices; a Crimson series on mental health at Harvard; and a Tumblr devoted to the same issues.
These discussions have sought to explain and understand student mental health at Harvard, broaching topics from services at UHS to a pervading atmosphere diagnosed, eloquently and memorably as “I Am Fine.” I cannot say with any kind of certainty where Harvard’s mental health problem—because we do, indeed, have a problem—comes from. Many of us, often, are far from fine. What I can say with certainty is that the conversation must go on.
This semester, we hope to write a long series of articles in an attempt to do just that. I am writing as a member of Harvard’s Student Mental Health Liaisons, a student group founded in 2008 to engage and inform students on issues of emotional wellbeing. Since getting involved with SMHL last fall, I have been inspired by the sincerity and earnestness of each member and the group as a whole in raising awareness on a broad swath of mental health issues on and beyond campus.
There needs to be a forum and catalyst for continuing discussions of mental health, and for establishing a community that supports improving mental health at Harvard. We plan to publish regular op-eds on a variety of topics this semester. We also want to hear from students, faculty, and other members of the Harvard community, who should get in touch with us through the contact section of our Harvard SMHL website so that their voices can be heard as well.
Let us keep the topic of mental and emotional wellbeing at the forefront this semester. In different ways we have all struggled, or are struggling, or will struggle, during our years at Harvard. I don’t think we can ever fully eliminate all difficulties. But we can work toward this by approaching them with empathy, compassion, and a desire to listen. We can tackle them with the knowledge that we are not alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On August 30 of last year, the email was sent out. Soon after, the news broke publicly. We all know the story. A cheating scandal, the largest this campus has ever known—or in the words of Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, one “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory”—had been uncovered and was under full-fledged investigation. The course was Government 1310, and the professor Matthew B. Platt.
After five months, we can say with a bit of confidence that the administration bears a considerable amount of blame for the harmful way in which proceedings were carried out. Specifically, the glacial pace of the Administrative Board process caused students undue stress and exposed the need for substantial reform. The picture that is forming before us implicates the class and school just as much as many accused students. This was a process fraught with institutional failure, and it is one that deserves not just our attention, but also our action.
The scandal was first discovered when, in mid-May, Platt and some of his teaching fellows noticed glaring similarities in the content and structure of different exams’ answers, as well as a typo repeated exactly by multiple students. From there one would assume the investigation took off with full force and speed, since Platt already suspected 13 of his students of plagiarism and had contacted the Ad Board regarding such. Yet it took the administration as many as three months to notify some students. This is where the investigation’s process should first be called into question. The immensity of the case, implicating roughly 125 of the class’s 279 students, could be seen as reason for the delay. Even when taking into account that large scope, though, three months remains an inexplicably and inexcusably long amount of time needed to look over the exams.
This slow pace of the investigation did not come without severe consequence, either. Investigated students and alumni made public early on the burdensome uncertainty that the late August announcement placed on them, an uncertainty only heightened for those left without a verdict until late fall. The stress this created caused some students to, despite maintaining their innocence, withdraw before their cases were even heard out of fear that their tuition and board fees might go to waste. Most others who similarly feared financial waste went on with their semesters anyway but remained ever tormented by the looming possibility of having to withdraw. The issue of such financial inequity, determined arbitrarily by when in the semester a student would have to leave, has since been addressed by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael Smith. This address came all too late, though, for the many students who had already suffered in believing that they might have had to sink their tuition and board costs if asked to withdraw.
Such uncertainty was a burden on the implicated students not only during the investigation, but also during last term’s now-controversial exam period. Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and prominent alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 have both voiced their disappointment with how the course in question was run, noting that it was known campus-wide as an easy A. Yet despite this reputation, it appears Professor Platt significantly altered the course’s style for the spring of 2012 and in doing so made its exams not only tougher, but also less clear in what they asked of students. Some students also said that collaboration was historically known to be a part of the course’s exams, but again the 2012 changes lead to new guidelines on what was and was not prohibited. Adding to the confusion, comments made by students in the Q Guide last spring suggest that some teaching fellows for the course helped students on the final exam by defining terms and discussing questions.
If teaching staff did not observe exam policies, one can hardly expect students to. While collaboration was prohibited on paper, in practice it seems that the opposite was perceived to be true, and so uncertainty in what was and wasn’t allowed among students and teaching fellows enabled the collaboration that would later be punished.
So yes, students that withdrew may have cheated on their final exams—in fact, several most definitely did via brazen copy-pasting—but the teaching staff and Ad Board failed to provide those same students with the process they deserved. Beyond simply highlighting the necessity of academic integrity, this scandal also highlights the necessity of good teaching, of clear policy, and of fair process. The student body should not just hope but also actively urge that in each of these areas Harvard improve. We should demand clearer collaboration policies, fewer poorly managed courses, and more timely Ad Board processes. Perhaps the scandal will ultimately prove important as an instigator of change rather than just as a stain on Harvard’s reputation.
Students shouldn’t cheat, and we should always work to reduce both academic dishonesty and the environments that facilitate it. But equally important is that students not be left in academic limbo while their case is worked out for months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Defense secretary Leon E. Panetta’s recent announcement that the military will officially lift its ban on women in combat roles was heralded by many as a leap forward for equality in an important American institution, and bemoaned by others as a case of sacrificing efficiency for political propriety. Given that men have dominated every aspect of the U.S. military since its inception, the move is a welcome recognition of women’s critical role in the modern armed forces. Action on this issue, however, is long overdue.
Lifting the ban on women in combat is one of many apparently progressive, but ultimately common sense moves that took a long time to adopt. As with other significant institutional changes, rational decision-making on this issue is precluded by what psychologists call loss aversion. When weighing future possibilities, we humans tend to have a much greater fear of suffering negative consequences than of missing out on positive consequences of equal magnitude.
For example, few people would take a bet in which they had a 90 percent chance to win $10 and a 10 percent chance to lose $90, even though the expected value of the bet is neutral. This choice seems perfectly reasonable, as $1 gained is worth slightly less than $1 lost, due to diminishing returns. Furthermore, it may be desirable for an organization like the military to be risk-averse in uncertain situations. However, the striking effects of loss aversion cannot be explained simply by diminishing returns and rational avoidance of risk.
In Daniel Kahneman’s recent book, “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” he points to several studies that have shown humans tend to weigh negative outcomes approximately twice as heavily as positive ones. In other words, to convince the average human to accept a bet in which there was a 50 percent chance of winning and a 50 percent chance of losing, the potential winnings would need to be twice as great as the potential losses. You would not accept a 10 percent chance to lose $90 until the alternate possibility was to gain $20.
Setting aside any argument about gender equality (I will return to this momentarily), the decision over whether to lift the ban is essentially a complicated version of the gamble presented above. Any significant change in institutional policy will bring with it unforeseeable consequences. Women may not be as big and strong as men, but they are also less impulsive and may make better decisions in combat. We will not realize all the results of putting men and women side by side on the battlefield until we have actually done so; for now, the best we can do is predict what will happen. This type of situation inevitably leads to irrational thinking, and the military’s decision-making process was undoubtedly affected by loss aversion.
We can forgive loss aversion in many contexts because it is an inherent part of human decision-making and usually harms only those who make irrational choices. Loss aversion may cause a small business owner to forego investment in a new technology that would most likely benefit the business and increase profits until the technology has been more widely adopted. In this case only the business owner, and perhaps a few employees, are hurt by the mistake.  Few would argue that all citizens have a moral imperative to make rational profit-maximizing decisions because of the incremental benefits (in taxes paid) to all other citizens.
Here, however, a moral element comes in. The military’s decision regarding the ban is not only relevant to those making the choice; it affects an entire class of people who have historically been discriminated against in the organization. There may be no moral obligation to reform irrational decision-making when only private interests are at stake, but in this case, women have received unfair treatment.
As the military warmed to the idea of women in combat, loss aversion caused it to needlessly drag its feet on the issue until the perceived benefits so heavily outweighed the potential costs that the ban was lifted. We did not need to wait this long. In cases such as this one, we have an obligation to use rational judgment so that loss aversion does not cause unnecessarily prolonged discrimination.
Now that the ban has been lifted, it seems that we have already leapt over whatever rational or irrational hurdles stood in the way of putting women in combat, but the transition will almost certainly not pass without a snag. There will be cases in which women make bad decisions on the battlefield, as men already do, and there may be cases in which a woman fails to succeed at a task that, in hindsight, a man might have been better equipped to perform. Unfortunately, these bumps in the road will probably receive more coverage than cases in which excellent choices made by female troops lead to important military successes.
We owe all the women who want to serve this country a fair evaluation, based not on our instinctive reactions but on a carefully considered cost-benefit analysis. In the next few years, we will have the opportunity not just to predict, but to observe the real results of putting women in the same combat roles as men. My intuition is that a few small but well-publicized problems will be far less important than the significant benefits that will come from adding to the military’s talent pool. I can only hope that our natural instinct to highlight the negative does not overshadow the positive effects that we see from this change.

The only beverage available in chemo is ginger ale, and it is diet. I don’t realize this until I pour myself a saccharine Styrofoam cup. “Rinse off the top of the can,” my grandma says, unwrapping cheese crackers to offer my aunt and me. I bring wet cans for the two of us. My grandmother says she doesn’t want any, pouring more sound and gesture into the statement than seems possible. My aunt in the reclining chair hears me cough and asks the nurse to get me a mask.
My grandmother has been coming here weekly, off and on, for as long as I can remember, which probably explains why I have only recently realized that this is frightening. There is a way of thinking about the body when you have not known acutely what it is to fear, a way that washes your childhood thin, until you can see through it like tissue paper.
She has been featured in the local cancer center’s calendar as Ms. June, an image we have hanging on the wall of our laundry room. I like to flip through the book. In it, each month’s model is quoted saying something inspiring. She says she trusts God. I tear into the rim of the Styrofoam cup, even though my first-grade teacher told me that ripping Styrofoam is bad for the environment. I decide I trust people in surgical masks, intimations of divinity, the way bodies spiral out of themselves at good kinds of touch.
We talk about the flu, how it’s an emergency in Boston, how reluctant well-meaning people are to get flu shots. I move my mask onto my face when I cough. My grandmother gives me 15 bucks.
“Because I am worried you won’t have any money until you get back to school,” she says. “When you are driving later, I want you to lock the car doors. You don’t know what people can do.”
As I’m about to go, I pour the half-full cup of pale yellow soda down the drain. It burps and fizzles. Afterwards, I drive slowly, conscious of the edges of the road.

“Ya no quedan cafés como este,” my professor informs us as we walk up Calle Dr. Drumen to El Brillante. The little street is littered with mismatched storefront signs, some old, others crooked. They signal a few run-down bodegas, two hotels, one Starbucks. El Brillante’s green awning is among them, printed with loopy white script that sports a gaudy star over the ‘i.’ When we reach the café, the nine of us—a group of Spanish literature students—file through the glass door and into the fluorescent-lit interior. My professor holds the door for us.
We are here in Madrid for one rainy January week. He spent the past semester teaching us about the literature and architecture of the city at the turn of the century. Now is our chance to see it all for ourselves: the neighborhood where Trapeillo based his short stories, Moneo’s modern extension to the Museo del Prado, the skyscrapers built to compete with the scales of London and Paris.
But before we head out each morning to wander, we stop in at El Brillante. The place does not have the glamorous, intricate interior one might expect from a European café. Rather, it features a scuffed linoleum floor, photographs of meal combos hung along the walls, and metal-topped bars that stretch the length of the narrow eatery. The bars lead down to another set of double doors that open onto the parallel street, Paseo de Sta. María de la Cabeza. Men in neatly pressed navy blue uniforms stand behind the counter, taking brusque orders. Everyone (but us, of course) is a regular. Nadie pide la carta.
My professor explains that this is the way cafés in Madrid used to be: sparse and unwelcoming, with waiters that remembered your name, your family’s background, who your plumber was, that your mother-in-law visited last weekend, and, naturally, your order.
He had a friend once—una puertorriqueña—who lived a block away from El Brillante. She ate breakfast here every morning and ordered the same thing almost always. One day, something came up and she left Spain, went back to Puerto Rico, or perhaps to the United States. When she returned to Madrid those years later, she stopped in at El Brillante. Before she could close the door behind her that first time back, the waiter turned to her and asked, “¿Lo de siempre, señora?”

The land here in the Navajo Nation seems to stretch infinitely under a weightless sky: orange cliffs, vistas spotted under snow, and in the middle of it all, the occasional home.
Twenty minutes off the main road and up a muddy path—the weather’s been a bit colder this January, but it’s left more slush than ice—the octagonal structure of a hogan appears, connected as one building to the side of a small, plain ranch.
Inside, Marcy, as I’ll call her, sits on her bed beneath one of the windows, wearing layered sweaters and two different colored socks. She greets us with a shining grin that reflects off newly plastered walls, and a bright gaze that falls slightly past our eyes.
Marcy is blind and diabetic. Last year, a doctor was brought here to see if anything might improve her health, but 87 years make some things irreversible. We are here delivering food that might last a week, and firewood that will last less than that. In winters like this, water tanks freeze and supplies run short, but right now the near 50-degree weather and spotless sky are deceiving. Inside the hogan, it’s warm.
“Ya’a’teh,” I say, all I know in Diné, or Navajo: Hello. Marcy’s hands, soft and smooth, take mine and wrap them in a slow shake. A neighbor helps translate the Navajo I can’t understand: Marcy’s caretaker constantly checks up on her, she says, and her daughter lives right next door—in one of the only three other houses outside for as far as I can see.
Hogans, I’m told, embody a sense of community; for generations, entire families have lived in one circular room, eating from the same central stove, together. Even with renovations and additions, a natural continuity grounds reservation life.
Out here there’s an unspoken pride in having direction; guided from house to house, we’re often told to go north or south but find that we don’t know one way from the other. As we leave, Marcy looks—sees—out her door. Its frame faces east like in all hogans, oriented so that in the morning, the rising sun pours its light inside.

Three times a week Charley M. Falletta ’16 beats the sunrise awake. Physical training at 6:30 a.m., an early-morning military science class, a weekly leadership lab: These commitments frame the rhythm of Falletta’s weeks here at Harvard in her position in the U.S. Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. The terms of Falletta’s ROTC scholarship will require her to complete four years of active duty, plus four on reserve. None of these roles would necessarily bring Falletta into combat. But beginning in January 2016, for the first time, they could.
Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Leon E. Pannetta announced that the Pentagon would overturn the military’s official policy banning women from serving in combat forces. The ban has been in effect since 1994. Pannetta’s announcement was met with widespread acclaim from those who say that reversing such policies promotes equality and fairness and recognizes of women who have already served in de facto combat roles in the past. Detractors claim that differing physical abilities and the danger of sexual crimes perpetrated by the enemy, for example, will threaten the security of the armed forces abroad.
For the ROTC cadets at Harvard interviewed by FM, the issue of serving in combat is often not a personal one. “It’s not what I want,” says Madison L. Coveno ’14, an Air Force ROTC cadet, referring to entering combat. The force’s brassy blue uniforms have always been comforting to Coveno, reminding her of her childhood: Her father was in the Air Force for 20 years. In general, according to Coveno, Air Force pilots play a relatively indirect role in combat. “Personally,” she adds, “I want something a little more intellectually stimulating.”
While women make up around 14 percent of all armed forces, Coveno estimates her field training group to be about 25 percent women. Falletta, meanwhile, says that her battalion—made up of cadets from Harvard, Tufts, and MIT—is about 40 percent women. “Not everyone is going in who wants to be in infantry,” says Falletta. Infantry, or combat roles, are far from the only possible path for women in ROTC, whose roles could include public relations, leadership positions on American bases, or other non-combat duties.
But as the number of women in the armed forces continue to grow, and as the terms of the Pentagon’s announcement continue to be debated, other lingering questions are being dredged up: What is it really like to be a woman in the military? To what extent has an older, male-dominated norm remained?
None of the students contacted for this article claim to have felt discriminated against as women in ROTC. “I’d speak very highly of all the cadets, especially the Harvard cadets,” says Falletta. She acknowledges that physical differences do exist between males and females in ROTC, but hasn’t felt any kind of prejudice (despite her petite five-foot frame).
Coveno agrees, at least with regards to Harvard. During a summer training camp, though, she recalls an incident involving a leadership simulation, in which some cadets were required to move sand bags and others patrolled the surroundings. The male leader immediately set the three women present to be the guards. “We took offense against that,” says Coveno. “We said, ‘hey, we can carry sandbags. We’re not weaklings.’”
Nevertheless, Coveno doesn’t see this kind of event as a major roadblock. “You run into things,” she says, “it happens, but you can solve it—you can talk about it.”
Carolyn F. Pushaw ’16, a member of Naval ROTC, has experienced similar instances of tension. Pushaw completed a program similar to but unaffiliated with ROTC in high school. “There was surprisingly a lot of sexism,” she says of the program.  Pushaw claims that on one carrier, for example, the officer in charge treated all of the females present differently from their male counterparts. He wouldn’t let the women go anywhere without being in a group, and would bar them from certain activities, Pushaw says. “I’ve found that in ROTC it’s a lot more equal,” she adds.
Pushaw has also become frustrated with the distinct physical standards to which male and female cadets are held. While a woman can pass the required run—a mile and a half—with a 13:30 time, a man must complete it two minutes faster. For Pushaw, all members should be held to the same standards—even, and especially, as women join in combat. “If only two women can pass through to infantry,” she says, “that’s what should happen.”
“They shouldn’t change standards to encourage women to do it,” she adds, “because that will compromise their overall operations.”
In reality, as multiple news sources have reported, women have been in positions of direct combat since the 1994 ban. More than 280,000 women have been deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, 800 have been wounded, and over 130 killed, according to The New York Times. The armed forces’ definition of “combat,” however, rests on a delicate web of bureaucracy in which language can make or break a promotion.
"I think it’s been a real slap in the face to women who were, frankly, serving in combat, to say that these positions were barred to women,” says Falletta. Without holding one of these positions, opportunities like going to ranger school or infantry training, in addition to being promoted, were also closed to women. “So essentially,” Falletta adds, “women were serving alongside men, but men were receiving this training that women hadn’t received.”
“So I think,” she concludes, “this is hugely important.”
Coveno agrees that some of the greatest impact of the change will involve women who have already served. “Even though they’re functionally there, being put in under-fire situations,” she says, “they’re not getting credited for it.”
Pushaw, despite her frustration with different physical standards between men and women in the military, fully supports the introduction of women into combat roles. Particularly in the current conflict, she says, women will be of direct use on the front lines. In many Middle Eastern cultures, she says, “There’s such a gender divide that we need women to associate with Middle Eastern women in situations where men can’t really do that.”
Pushaw acknowledges that the gender relations in the military are far from perfect. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are worryingly high in the armed forces now, according to the media. Yet she says she believes that introducing women into combat could be fundamental to addressing this issue. “If men had to rely on women in situations in which they might protect their lives,” she says, “they would see them less as objects of sexual desire and more as equals.”
“This is one of the last bastions of a really gender-segregated institution,” Pushaw says. “How will that ever change unless we start now?”
Note: All those interviewed for this article agreed to speak in their capacity as individuals, not as official representatives of any ROTC.

It’s day 29 of being home for winter break, and I am starting to get a taste of what it’s going to take to become a real woman living in the real world. I have high hopes of eventually being employed someday. If it happens, it will be magical.
To get employed, my mom tells me, I will need to attend an interview. I will need to look presentable in said interview, she says, a cut above my signature jeans and ponytail. This means the unthinkable: I will need to go shopping.
I avoid malls like I avoid that kid in section, and do a pretty good job of it: My last mall visit happened in middle school. Today, I re-enter. Shut in a changing room I experiment with “business outfits,” which are broader-shouldered and bulkier than normal-person clothing. My body looks portly beneath the frumpy fabric, so my mom recommends I try adding heels—a clothing item I tend to wear for approximately 15 minutes each semester on the way to a formal. (I slide them off the second I arrive at the dance, like all practical souls do.) Heels are important, my mom says, because they make one look elevated and elegant. Looks like the day will involve purchasing more than a pantsuit.
Fresh out of DSW with my first pair of stilettos, mom mentions that she has plans to get her eyebrows waxed the next day and wonders if I want to do the same. She casually questions when I last had someone look at my eyebrows, and I casually answer that it was quite a while back. She feigns a half-smile and nods.
When the Vietnamese lady who owns the local nail and waxing shop squats down and stares into my face, she screams. Not a gasp, but a full-fledged screech that causes all the middle-aged women getting pedicures to snap their heads in my direction and giggle. “Lot of work to do,” the owner sighs, pointing me towards her operating table of waxation.
She does not mess around. Seconds later I am stretched out horizontally getting a full-face wax. The thin baby hair coating my cheeks, neck, chin, upper lip all disappears, ripped away strip by hot wax strip. I writhe and crinkle my face with each of her pulls. “This is torture, right?” she chuckles.
Once my face is hairless, Mom wants to know about the hair on top of my head—the hair that’s supposed to be there. To her surprise, I had very responsibly gotten my hair cut two weeks ago (point for me!). What mom really wants to know, though, is the last time I blow-dried my hair. Womp womp. I do not own a hair dryer…or a hairbrush. Combs work just fine.
Mom begins to enlighten me with her mystical hair care knowledge. Apparently there’s a way to prevent hair from looking “limp” and “plastered to one’s forehead,” and it involves using a hair dryer along with multiple models of hairbrushes. Her tone is loving and understanding, with only a very slight edge of accusation.
Two hours later, we’ve purchased a hair dryer and my face is still blotchy red. Perturbed about my quite visible facely tenderness, my mom infers that perhaps the problem is one of moisture. I’m really not the face type—I’ve never been into makeup or face washing, and I was not aware that face moisturizing was a thing people did. Mom hands me a bottle of Olay and advises me to moisturize my face and neck every night. “Got to prevent those wrinkles!” she chimes.
While we’re on the subject of faces, Mom decides to go for gold. We will confront the dreaded final frontier: makeup. Makeup cannot be explained; it must be handed down experientially.
When we get home I meet her in her bathroom, stare into its wide mirror lined with glowing bulbs. Mom has prepared the counter by laying her beauty products out across the counter so that the whole bathroom looks like a paint studio: fluffy brushes, open-faced pallets holding powders colored rose and peach.
She swishes her brushes into the powders, dots the skin-tone speckles all over my face as if she’s replicating Seurat’s pointillism. Blush goes in a thin oval above the cheekbones, while concealer saves the day by covering the baggy evidence of sleep-deprivation that hangs below my eye sockets.
I gaze into the mirror at a newly moisturized, freshly plucked and powdered face. The strands of my hair are dryer-kissed and tattered with flyaways. What will the employers think?

Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and addressed the throngs of Americans crowded onto the National Mall.
“I have a dream,” he said, “that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”
These words, among the first of a new nation, have not been taken lightly.
On Monday, Jan. 21, two miles down the National Mall from the Lincoln Memorial, President Barack Obama echoed Dr. King. From the steps of the Capitol, Obama called for an end to inequality and, just like those great orators before him, summoned a new generation to fight discrimination. “Our journey is not complete,” Obama said, ”until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.”
There on the lawn of the Capitol, I couldn’t help but smile with pride as my president called out for gay equality and voting equality and women’s equality.
Woven throughout his speech, Obama referenced great prose of the American past. “My fellow Americans”: He quoted John F. Kennedy. “We the people”: He harkened back to the American Constitution. “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” reminded his listeners of this country’s Declaration of Independence. And when he said that the founders gave to us “a government of, and by, and for the people,” Obama echoed the words that were engraved in the stone of the Lincoln Memorial in front of him across the mall.
“Our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation,” Lincoln said 150 years ago, “conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”
“Now,” he continued, “we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.”
And with the 262 words of the Gettysburg Address, Lincoln established that the bloodiest feud in American history was fought for the survival of a young nation, a nation still trying to live up to its founders’ expectations—that in this country, on this new continent, all men would be recognized as equals. And Lincoln proclaimed:
“We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. And that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.”
Abraham Lincoln said, “The world will little note nor long remember what we say here.”
It seems to me, Mr. President, that what we say might be the only thing the world will long remember.

6:35 p.m.
An old man sits and hums to himself in the Pit by the Harvard T-stop. Resting on his shoulder, a full-sized Tibetan flag flits and flutters in the wind, its sunny streaks of red and cobalt lighting up the January night.
A woman in her mid-20s wearing high-heeled boots and a black coat emerges from Dunster Street to sit beside the old man. They fall naturally into conversation and are soon joined by another young Tibetan in a blue hoodie. The older man passes a worn composition notebook to the younger one, who pens his signature at the bottom of a long list of names. He is number 2,354. Next to his signature he scrawls a note in the margin: “Free Tibet!”
This composition notebook logs all of the guests who attend the weekly Tibet Freedom Vigil in the Harvard Square Pit. The tradition began in March 2008 in response to a significant Tibetan uprising, in which those living in Tibet broke out in riots protesting Chinese occupation of their homeland. Demonstrations began in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, then spread throughout the country and the world. Fueled by the renewed urgency and spirit of the Tibetans back home, a group of young Tibetan activists in Boston decided to stand in solidarity with their compatriots.
“For a lot of young Tibetans it was the first time [in their lifetimes] that something dramatic had happened inside Tibet. It was happening today—not in historical context,” says Tsepa Bayul, one of the founding organizers of the Tibet Freedom Vigil in Harvard Square who was 22 at the time of the 2008 protest. “We figured we would go out in the streets, talk to other Tibetan supporters, and figure out what to do.”
Tibetans chose the Harvard Pit as their demonstration local because of its visibility and tendency to attract tourists from all over the world. Ever since Harvard Square’s first vigil on March 14, 2008, a core group of Tibetans has gathered every week with banners, flags, and a microphone to educate passersby on the Chinese government’s human rights violations in Tibet. They have not missed a single Wednesday.
6:57 p.m.
Vigilpala steps up to the microphone.  His real name is Tsering Dongshi, but he goes by Vigilpala, or “vigil father” in Tibetan, due to his perfect attendance at the Harvard Square Vigil.  Vigilpala begins with traditional Tibetan chanting: low, reverberating tones that to foreign ears sound like the deep gurglings of a tape recorder on half speed. He will chant until around 8 p.m. and then close the vigil with the Dalai Lama’s prayer, the Tibetan Uprising Song, and the Tibetan National Anthem.
Bayul and his fellow organizers, Ngawang Jorden and Dhondup Phunkhang, began the Wednesday vigil tradition as a way for the Tibetan community in Boston to participate in the international Lhakar movement.  Derived from the Tibetan words “white Wednesday” to celebrate the purity of the Dalai Lama’s soul day, Lhakar embraces the power of strategic nonviolent resistance against China. As part of Lhakar, Tibetans pledge to preserve their culture every Wednesday, by wearing traditional Tibetan clothing, mentioning Tibet on social media, shopping at Tibetan-owned stores, or attending a Tibetan protest. In doing so, Tibetans strengthen and perpetuate their culture, one that many believe China is trying to dilute in its occupation of the region.
For Tibetans, complaints concerning the Chinese occupation abound: According to many in Boston’s Tibetan community, China imposes religious restrictions on Tibetans, closes Tibetan schools to wipe out use of the language, tortures and kidnaps Tibetans, and incentivizes wide-scale Han Chinese migration to Tibet as part of what some call an “ethnic cleansing” project As a result, many Tibetans living in Tibet have responded with self-immolation, the practice of setting oneself on fire. Nearly 100 self-immolations by Tibetans within Tibet have been reported since February 2009, according to Tibetan rights organizations.
“Tibetans inside Tibet have been so oppressed by the Chinese government that they see self-immolation as the only resort for a speaking voice. These self-immolations have been done strategically, so that the outside world can act upon them,” argues Tenzin Yangchen, a board member of Students for a Free Tibet and the Secretary General of the Tibetan Association of Boston, which has over 600 members. “Their sacrifices will go in vain if we as Tibetans, as human rights supporters, don’t do something to carry on their voice.” According to Havard Divinity School student Joshua Eaton ’10, an activist and journalist who specializes in Tibetan issues, those within Tibet have heard about the existence of the vigil in Harvard Square, and they know others are speaking on their behalf.
Ngawang Jorden, another of the vigil’s founding organizers, believes the vigil has helped alter the perspectives of many locals. Jorden says that a Chinese man once slipped him a $100 bill at the vigil, explaining that he strongly supported the Tibetan community but that he could not admit so in China without consequences. Jorden also remembers a three-year-old toddler, a boy who was not Tibetan, who demanded to be taken to the weekly vigil by his parents.
“Our struggle is not something we can just look at. If you are creating a shoe, you see the result.  Our struggle is not like that—ours has lasted 50 years,” explains Jorden. “It’s a slow process, but little by little I think we do change people’s minds.”
7:02 p.m.
The shine of headlights from Mass. Ave commuters appears like bright stripes across the faces of the 20 or so Tibetans who have assembled for this Wednesday’s protest. They have come prepared with signs and artwork. One hand-written poster demands “Human Rights for Tibet.” Another sign depicts a baby blue cloud with the text: “Tibet Freedom Vigil—Every Wednesday 6-8 p.m. Harvard Sq.—Until Tibet is Free.”

If you’re tired of spending night after night at a Grafton Group Restaurant or sick of wandering up and down Mt Auburn St searching for a party, look no further. The Sinclair, a new concert venue and restaurant located at 52 Church St., has opened to the Square.
The Sinclair is the newest concert venue backed by The Bowery Presents, the New York-based booking company behind such iconic spaces as the Bowery Ballroom and Terminal 5. Now, for the price of a movie ticket, you can go see a concert in the Square and possibly splurge for a nice meal afterward. The food will cost a little more than, say, Bertucci’s, but The Sinclair offers a much better atmosphere than an Italian chain restaurant.
The Harvard Square location presented a unique challenge to The Bowery Presents because of Cambridge’s puritanical liquor laws, which forbid nightclub licenses; businesses cannot serve alcohol without food. In the face of such restrictions, Bowery decided to go into the restaurant business at The Sinclair, a bold move for a company that had never done so before.
The resulting space—part restaurant, part concert venue—provides a unique addition to a Square in need of new nightlife options. Though Harvard  Square lacks nightclubs like New Haven’s ubiquitous Toad’s Place (or even a movie theater, for that matter), The Sinclair concert venue may fill some of that void with a large wraparound balcony, a maximum capacity of 525 people, and, most importantly, three bars.
“The idea behind the [concert] space is to be able to have views from everywhere,” says Josh Bhatti, the head of The Bowery Presents: Boston, who spent two years working on The Sinclair prior to its opening. According to Bhatti, the large stage and balcony allow the audience to get as close to the performers as possible, in order to “concentrate the energy” of the room. Indeed, the stage seems massive. It’s hard to believe that this space can fit right in the middle of the Square.
With its relatively small capacity compared to other concert venues, The Sinclair will feature more up-and-comers than hit acts, but The Bowery Presents’ connections within the music industry have allowed them to plan for about 200 events per year in the space. “A lot of the bands are coming to us,” Bhatti says. Recent performances include a New Year’s event with Deer Tick and a sold out Duncan Sheik concert last week.
Bhatti also advertises that The Sinclair will be available to rent out for events on the nights without planned concerts, which could present exciting opportunities for student groups constantly in need of venues for theatrical productions, charity fundraisers, or social gatherings. Also, it has three bars.
Bhatti hopes the space will mirror New York’s Mercury Lounge, a precursor to the Bowery Ballroom with a capacity of 200 people, which hosted the White Stripes, LCD Soundsystem, and Arcade Fire before they went on to mainstream success. “This size is really exciting for bands,” says Bhatti. “You’re going to go tell 20 friends who won’t have heard of them about the concert. The idea being that when [the band] takes off more people will know about them.”
Off to a Fast Start
Finally opening in December after multiple construction delays, The Sinclair has enjoyed early success. It has sold out eight of its last 10 shows, according to Bhatti. “The reaction’s been fantastic,” says Bhatti. “People are really excited about how the room feels, how it looks.”
Bhatti partly attributes this positive feedback to the staff’s friendly demeanor. The bartenders are trained to be inviting, he says, and there are no bouncers at the door. Instead, the event staff check ID’s. “People act how they’re treated, and if you walk in and the guy at the door is just a bully or a meathead, it makes you feel you have the ability to act like that too,” says Bhatti.
Yet getting to opening day at The Sinclair was not a seamless process. The venue’s many construction delays reached comical levels, preventing the venue’s opening by over a month and leading to the creation of a Tumblr called “The Sinclair is Not Open.” The fact that the restaurant’s opening fell in the middle of January right after the holiday season was not ideal, Bhatti assented, but luckily business has been good thus far.
Bhatti chalks up the delays to the widely held desire to get everything absolutely right in both spaces. “We wanted a space that would last, we plan on being here for a long time,” Bhatti says.
Affordability Matters
In order to attract students, the Sinclair has worked to provide affordable concerts and meals for its patrons. According to Bhatti, 80 percent of the concerts at the Sinclair cost below 20 dollars. “We wanted our prices to be accessible so that people can come back multiple times,” Bhatti says. In addition, very few concerts have a 21-plus age restriction, making it easier for students to attend.
The Bowery Presents also worked to keep the restaurant “elevated, yet accessible.” The menu, designed by executive Chef Michael Schlow, features dinner entrees that hover around 20 dollars, as well as a less expensive late night menu. “Our price points were huge to us,” Bhatti says, “We try to keep ticket prices really low, and serving food that felt overpriced just felt disingenuous.”
The restaurant has a transportation theme, complete with custom subway tiles and maps. Bhatti says he wanted the design of the space to have a connecting thread while avoiding “kitsch.” The Sinclair also sought to distinguish itself from the tavern feel of Grafton Group restaurants, and went with a more “bunkery” vibe, he says. The Sinclair will also be able to utilize its outdoor patio in the spring: take that, Charlie’s Kitchen!
Bhatti pitches The Sinclair as a place to spend an entire evening—moving from the restaurant to the concert space—or to just stop by as one fun part of your night.
Either way, Bhatti says, “You’re going to come here and be treated well. Better than any music venue in town—I guarantee it.” He continues, “Hopefully it’s that place that two years later, 10 years later you’ll be able to say, ‘Oh yeah, I saw that band at the Sinclair.’”

Dipping into the Harvard archives, FM discovered that the University has put the postal service to work throughout the years. It turns out that the recent letter by alumnus Thomas G. Stemberg’s ’71 is not the first correspondence to make Crimson news. Harvard’s history is fraught with piles of letters, many simply addressed to “Harvard University, Harvard, USA” with questions about math problems, requests for degrees, and even suggestions for world peace. Here are a few of the strangest discoveries:
• One man wrote to the University, requesting thatHarvard loan him one million dollars to collectbutterflies. His big sell fell short, reading, “You’rea big strong university, you can stand the strain oflowering one million dollars down here.”
• In 1916, another writer had a much simplerrequest. He wrote, “dEar sirs; I am a poor boiewhat wud lik to hav a education an it iz for thisreson that I am riting to you at this time… iwud like to no how i kin ern my way thru skul.” Unfortunately, Harvard did not admit the boy, andspell check was not invented for another 75 years.
• In response to a young boy’s written plea for Harvardsports memorabilia in 1949, the University vowedto send pennants to any child upon written request. The Crimson published an article about the deal,entitled, “University Mails Out Sticker PennantsGratis to Urchins.” The free pennants almost madeup for referring to the kids as urchins—almost.
• Harvard professors were unable to help a manfrom Cedar Rapids, who wrote to the Universityrequesting instructions for how to catch pigeons. Office workers believed an aspiring carrier pigeonentrepreneur wrote the letter—or at least they hoped.
• More recently, Grace Oberhofer attempted to get off ofthe waitlist by singing a letter to Harvard in a YouTube video. “Harvard, you mean the world to me, on JohnHarvard’s statue I’d never pee,” she crooned. Even though the video, “Dear Harvard,” has over 100,000 views, Harvard never accepted Oberhofer, who now attends Tufts, where she is free to urinate on any statue.
Harvard’s mailbox has always been full, whether its contents are condemning, off-key, or just about pigeons. So consider this a thank-you note, Harvard, for putting up with the bizarre—and, as a side note, FM would also like to formally request a pennant.

Harvard rang in the new semester last Thursday with its fourth annual “Harvard Thinks Big,” an event that featured six different Harvard professors, as well as a student, giving 10-minute speeches. FM recently acquired a list of speeches that didn’t make the cut. They are presented below in their full glory:
“This Republic of Hot Yoga”—Presented by Drew G. Faust
The event’s keynote speaker, Faust enthusiastically bounces onto the stage wearing her signature neon spandex shorts and headband. “Who’s ready to roll?!” Faust asks the crowd, which had expected a lecture on the Civil War.
“What the ‘N.’ Stands For: The Greg Mankiw Story”— Presented by N. Gregory Mankiw
Mankiw walks to the stage to thesound of deafening applause. Uponarriving to the podium, he takes out anew copy of Principles of Economics,his bestselling economics textbook,and encourages the audience topurchase it (“not the used edition!”).After discovering that the speech willnot count as one of his mandatoryEc 10 lectures, he leaves the stage,leaving preceptor David Johnson tofinish the remainder of the speech.
“This is Harvard Thinks Big”—Presented by David J. Malan ’99
The words “This is Harvard Thinks Big” are on the big screen, but where is David Malan? There he is, flying on to the Sanders Theater stage wearing an Iron Man suit. As he lands, his team of lady dancers, clad in CS50 lingerie, rush on stage and shoot t-shirts into the stands using their patented CS50 t-shirt guns. He concludes with a five minute slideshow featuring the CS50 TFs.
“My Thoughts on Life”—Presented by Larry H. Summers
Addressing the crowd in a smooth,baritone voice, the former presidentof the university says nothingcontroversial or offensive in theslightest.
“What I Do: An Explanation of My Job”—Presented by Evelyn Hammonds
Hammonds leaves the stage. Five minutes later, she comes back with a basket of Boloco burritos.

Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” disappeared spring semester of 2013 at its home of courses.cs50.net. It is three years old.
A wide range of students from different sports teams—from basketball to football to baseball—all confirmed the disappearance. After years of popularity, when it seemed to have it all figured out, Government 1310’s life took an unexpected turn. Last year, some students saw Government 1310’s behavior change as it began to act unpredictably. About Government 1310, one student anonymously told the QGuide, “I got shafted.”
Government 1310’s disappearance prompted a search for new classes. Many students found an alternative in Sociology 43: “Social Interaction.”
If a student had been contacted about Government 1310’s disappearance, he might have said the exact same thing as the student before him, who might have said the same thing as the student before him.
Government 1310 has left a note on courses.cs50.net that it will return in Spring ’14. If you know the whereabouts of the course beforehand, or see a class that fits this description, please contact the nearest thesis-writing senior immediately.

DISCLAIMER: Due to the alarming amount of bias in the following piece, it must be clarified that the author has intimate ties to the subject. By that, I obviously mean the aspiring to intimate ties kind.
Ma chère Marion,
Marion. My life, my lust. Ma-ri-on: the sound of each syllable contorting everything from lips to throat to, on three, turn the mouth into a Cheerio. Ma. Rrgghrri. On.
You walked into Farkas wearing a tailored, asymmetric black and white striped blouse and could’ve walked away with more than just a golden Pudding Pot. You could’ve had me…in a state of catatonic fangirl shock, eager to mumble incoherent adulations to you in person.
Yet you chose to postpone our destined encounter for fame and glory. At first this seemed vain, but after seeing your black heel-less boots (I mean, who DOES that?#inspiration) and your Namaste to the hosts, I was convinced otherwise. Not to mention that slight millisecond when you looked in my general direction, said, “I love being kissed,” and added, “You are good kissers.” Now, I prefer subtle flattery, but hey girl. Hey.
Accepting the Hasty Pudding Theatrical’s tasks was the most sincere form of courtship I’ve witnessed in my brief existence. Proving yourself to me in front of a room full of people who paid to see you? Unbelievably romantic. The one thing I did not appreciate was Leonardo DiCaprio’s “guest appearance.” Come on. A ménage à trois seemed like a great idea at the time, OK?
After Leo—whom I confess I still have a thing for—revealed that completing a particular task would free you from meta-dreams, you persevered like the goddess that you are. You left a visibly diseased Gwyneth Paltrow speechless when you flawlessly acted out a death scene, impersonated Forrest Gump with a Donald Duck-esque Southern accent, and apologized for the debacle that was “Nine.” [(Tearfully.) I forgive you.] Both Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso could not live up to the existential self-portrait you insightfully captioned “REALLY GOOD DEAD PERSON.” Even Édith Piaf herself seemed negligible after your screechy rendition of “Non, je ne regrette rien.”
Oh yeah, and the Hasty Pudding Theatricals put on a show of sorts at the end. I mean, I guess they were ridiculously talented or whatever, but I only have eyes for you, mon amour. The back of your head, that is, but still.
Bisous.

Even families have hierarchies—I mean look at the Kardashians. My family hierarchy has always been clearly defined. My mom was the boss with the wallet, my brother just bossed me around, and I was the bottom of the bucket: the chump of the family. Then we got a dog.
 
We are not a pet family. Once we had a dog, named Pepper. It was horrible, to say the least. She scratched every inch of glass on the back French doors, chewed through the back gate, and destroyed my black lab stuffed animal that coincidentally was also named Pepper. When that didn’t work out, Pepper had to go live on a nice farm. 
 
It’s amazing that after almost a decade, my mom let my brother get another dog. She was already not a fan of animals inside the house, and no one could forget the destruction that Pepper left in her wake. My mom and I were prepared for accidents inside the house and mayhem everywhere. But Hanzo was perfect. 
 
He was everything we wanted in a dog. The little Shiba Inu was smart, potty-trained, and as cute as could be. He even rang a bell when he wanted to use the bathroom. He was so perfect that I suddenly found myself even further down the totem pole.
 
Hanzo is an early riser for sure. Let the games begin at 6:30 a.m. But don’t worry. My mom always shut my brother’s door to be sure that he gets plenty of sleep. Sadly, my door remained open and I got to wake up to the sound of Hanzo ringing the bell to go outside and play. I thought breaks were supposed to mean sleeping in, but there I was playing with the energetic fur ball as I watched the sun start to peak its rays out. How was I supposed to kick around a soccer ball when I was still trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes?
 
The worst part is that Hanzo knows he is higher than me in the family hierarchy. Shiba Inus are pack dog and all about the rankings. Sure, we love each other, but it’d be nice if he listened to me occasionally. 
 
Come.
Hanzo! Come!
Seriously come inside! 
Okay whatever. See if I care.
 
Hanzo listens to everyone else, but he seems to know that I’m the pushover in the family. He won’t even try begging my brother for food, but I’m his go to girl. 
 
But maybe being at the bottom of the hierarchy isn’t as bad as I’m making it out to be. Adding Hanzo to the family means that our trio has now become a quartet. It means that there’s another family member to love and be loved by. I’ll take all of that even if it means being at the bottom of the dog pile.

When you die, one of the first things the hospital gives your loved ones is a plastic bag with your belongings. It’s the same sort of sterile plastic bag that you get when you throw up on yourself and would rather not wear your soiled sweatshirt home. When your loved ones are ready, they’ll open it to find earrings, a scarf, and other things you couldn’t take with you to the afterlife.
My best friend’s mother died the day after Christmas this winter. There were still poinsettias in the church during Suzy’s funeral, and my friend asked in a murmur if I thought the color inappropriate. I told her that I didn’t think anyone would make the connection. I wondered if the room found comfort in the pastor’s words, if they even knew how to respond to his routine “peace be with you.” 
Normally, one has some time to separate the materials that constitute memories from those one feels comfortable donating. People comb through things they’ve never seen before and weigh sentimental value against space efficiency. 
But Alivia, a teenager with little storage space and no way to pay rent beyond January, faced the assignment of power-purging her former home of her deceased mother’s belongings. It was fortuitous timing in some ways, mainly because Alivia’s good friends were on a break from school and could help her. I was there so often that one could probably explain my present tolerance of cat dander by calling my stay “allergy exposure therapy.” We ate cheesecake, blasted One Direction, looked through Suzy’s photos from fashion design school, and wondered what in the hell we were going to do with the giant looms in the corner. 
When you die, your house becomes a dumpster of sorts, and those whom you leave behind are left to scavenge at will. I kept a wallet of Suzy’s. It’s a 90s-utilitarian, ugly, pink thing that I never saw her use. Maybe she never did. But when I see that wallet sitting on my desk, I don’t think about the wallet itself. Actually, I’ve probably spent a little more time smelling it than looking at it. It has that same smoky, yet fresh smell that overpowered me every time I walked into Alivia’s apartment.
Alivia is afraid that she’ll forget certain things about her mother. It’s only natural; in some ways, it seems like so much of her mother’s identity is in a landfill now. Alivia lost so much that is tangible that she believes she’ll forget what was perceptible—her mother’s face, what her voice sounded like, maybe even what she smelled like.
What she will remember, however, is moments in time with her mother. She won’t forget calling her mom during the occasional walk of shame (or, as my roommate emphasizes, “stride of pride”) and telling her mother/best friend about her night. She won’t forget when her mom took the lead in a parents’ rendition of one of our show choir performances (and did her booty-poppin’ daughter proud). What she truly gave her daughter never took as solid a form as something that she wove or sewed, but it will inevitably last longer.
The two giant looms—at which Suzy spent hours each day weaving—will likely end up either pathetically disassembled in storage somewhere or in a stranger’s house. They’ll practically become invisible to Alivia, but as soon as she thinks about coming home from school each day, she’ll see her mother look up from her weaving to greet her. 
When you die, maybe your belongings become a metaphor for your body. What is palpable melts away, freeing what is truly you. Their apartment is barer than ever, but I don’t think it’s empty. It’s filled with more substantial things than looms or photographs or even a smoky scent. It’s immaterial.

The Republican Party must increase the diversity of its ideas and members to achieve electoral success, according to five prominent Republicans who spoke at a panel discussion at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday night.
“I think that young people care very much about having a more open society,” panelist and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry M. Healey ’82 told her audience. She named gay rights and environmentalism as issues that matter to the nation’s younger voters.
Healey was joined on the panel by Ronald I. Christie and Karen Hughes—both members of former President George W. Bush’s inner circle—as well as CNN contributor Ana Navarro and John Murray, former deputy chief of staff to U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor. At the event, which was hosted by the Institute of Politics and moderated by IOP director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94, all five panelists urged their party to incorporate a greater variety of perspectives.
Christie kicked off the discussion by saying the GOP has erred by not making a greater effort to reach out to young people and people of color. It has also made a mistake by behaving in a way that seems “hostile” and “angry” to some, he said.
Panelists also reflected on the GOP’s poor showing in last November’s election, which saw Democrats retain their grip on the White House and strengthen their hold on the Senate. Navarro said that she blames the GOP’s failure to appeal to diverse groups for its disappointing performance.
“We had bad outreach, we had a bad message,” she said, adding that she believes Republicans can “sound to others as righteous, judgmental people.”
To rectify these problems, “I don’t think Republicans need to shift, but to accept diversity of thought,” Navarro said.
Panelists agreed that the party should seek ideological diversity by embracing voters who may not identify as Republicans. In this vein, Healey said that libertarians and moderates must be invited into a “coalition of conservatives,” which could coalesce around issues such as international affairs, fiscal policy, and states’ rights.
At times, panelists went beyond merely reflecting on the party’s past to instead comment on its future.
Healey, who served as membership secretary for the Harvard Republican Club when it had only 12 members, told the audience she will not seek the U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts recently vacated by Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
“But I promise we’re going to have a wonderful, wonderful candidate,” said Healey, who did not reveal which possible contender she supported.

Vice President and Nobel Laureate Al Gore ’69 praised recent efforts of Harvard students involved in environment and divestment campaigns during a speech focused on the health hazards of global warming which he gave in Memorial Church on Wednesday night.
Hundreds of students and community members lined the Yard in hopes of securing a spot in Memorial Church to hear the man introduced as “in truth, the elected president by America.”
Eric S. Chivian ’64, director of the Center for Health and Global Environment at Harvard Medical School, turned the stage over to Gore, whose talk was entitled “Healthy Planet, Healthy People.” The talk was sponsored by CHGE as part of the recently launched Paul R. Epstein Memorial Lecture Series.
During his talk, Gore lauded Harvard’s progress in becoming a more sustainable institution.
“One of my previous visits here with President Faust was to witness the launching of the Harvard Office of Sustainability,” said Gore. “And now some time has passed and we see extremely impressive results, not least of which is the incredible activism and engagement by students who have contributed to the progress the University has been able to make.”
Gore stated that consequences of global warming are compelling and devastating, but said that he believes in humanity’s ability to effect positive change.
“The dangers we face are almost unimaginably dire,” Gore said. “My hope is based on the history of our experience as a species.”
Gore said that the warming climate has destructive effects on human health. He noted examples of climate change that have influenced insect behavior and, therefore, the spread of diseases such as West Nile virus.
According to Gore, recent health dangers were anticipated by Epstein, a leader in the field of climate change at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“Everything that I’ve read to you about these recent findings was anticipated by Paul Epstein,” said Gore. “He wrote seminal papers 12 years ago. He saw the pattern very carefully and he was right. We all have a great debt to him.”
Gore voiced his disappointment in the current political system and the lack of discourse related to climate change in the recent presidential election.
However, he expressed hope in President Barack Obama’s ability to combat the rising temperature trends.
“I am optimistic today also because in his inspiring inaugural address, President Obama made the climate crisis the very first challenge he discussed and spent more words on it than any other. I was thrilled by that.”
The idea of the night was change. Gore continually stressed the urgency of the current situation, appealing to the audience with analogies.
“We’re using the atmosphere as an open sewer and it’s functionally insane,” Gore quipped.

Greater efforts should be taken to integrate scientific research into policies, Paul M. Nurse, the president of the Royal Society, said at the Science and Democracy Lecture Series on Wednesday evening.
Nurse, along with a panel of esteemed colleagues, emphasized “the primacy of the individual” in the face of a changing landscape for science and research.
“Scientific inquiry is concerned with acquiring knowledge of the natural world and ourselves. We’re interested in applying that knowledge,” Nurse said.
The panelists, MIT biology professor Eric S. Lander, physics professor Lisa J. Randall ’84, and history of science professor Charles Rosenberg, shared their diverse academic perspectives on the benefits and challenges of integrating science and policy.
Some of the obstacles derive from the permanent and irreversible nature of the reforms, Randall said.
Nurse cited current issues such as climate change and genetically modified crops to demonstrate the need to fund focused research.
Reflecting on the challenge of selecting reliable researchers from a pool of grant applicants, Nurse conveyed his approach to funding science: pick “people not projects.”
While Nurse emphasized applied research, he and the panelists spoke to the importance of broad research as well, recalling the original function of the Royal Society to encourage innovation and academic curiosity.
“With both [Harvard and the Royal Society], it was about finding a venue in which knowledge could be shared,” said Everett Mendelsohn, a history of science professor.
In the 19th century, when Harvard’s interactions with the Royal Society were frequent, both were serving as scientific research institutions.
But by the 20th century, the Society had shifted focus to being “the public face of established science in Britain,” said Alex Csiszar, who teaches history of science.
Moderated by Harvard Kennedy School professor of environmental science and public policy Sheila Jasanoff, the lecture was co-sponsored by Harvard’s Center for the Environment, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Graduate School of Design.

Final papers and projects will no longer be due during reading period if a proposal discussed at Wednesday’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting comes to fruition.
At the meeting, committee chair and Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented a proposal that would alter the structure of reading period, committee member and Pforzheimer House resident dean Lisa Boes said in an interview Wednesday evening.
Under the proposed schedule, all final course assignments would be due at designated dates during exam period, Boes confirmed. Students would be notified of these due dates at the beginning of the semester.
Committee members also discussed adjusting the length of reading period. Currently, reading period usually lasts between seven and eight days, while exam period is typically nine days long. Under the proposal, reading period would lose a day, while exam period would be extended by one day and possibly renamed “final project period,” Boes confirmed.
Boes said she supports the proposal because it better defines the last weeks of the semester.
“It also treats the culmination of courses in a comparable way, regardless if the culminating work is a paper or a project or a seated exam,” Boes said. “I think the format [Harris has] proposed is helpful for students because it protects reading period.”
Harris did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon.
Boes also voiced hope that the proposed change would eliminate stress for students, saying she believes two or more papers due within the last days of reading period can cause anxiety.
Danny P. Bicknell ’13, former president of the Undergraduate Council, said he believes the plan has the potential to benefit students.
“Any proposal that reexamines the true purpose of reading period should be welcomed by students,” Bicknell said, adding that the details of the proposal will need students’ feedback.
The Committee on Undergraduate Education is not a decision-making body, and instead offers a forum for the professors, administrators, and students who serve as its members to brainstorm and debate pedagogical changes. For the change to be enacted, the faculty would have to vote on the proposal, which would require an open discussion at a faculty meeting and another discussion by the Faculty Council, according to Boes.
UC Vice President Jen Q. Y. Zhu ’14, who was present at the meeting, said in an interview Wednesday evening that it is important for students to be involved in the discussion going forward. Zhu also said both students and administrators should make sure they are aware of any unintended consequences the change might create.

A group of Harvard students has launched a campaign protesting international Hillel policies banning partnerships with student groups that “support boycott of, divestment from, or sanctions against the State of Israel.”
The campaign, called Open Hillel and spearheaded by the Hillel-affiliated student group Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, officially launched Jan. 31 with a petition to Hillel International that had already gathered more than 430 signatures as of press time early Thursday morning.
The PJA came up with the idea for Open Hillel after it was prevented from holding an event at Harvard Hillel co-sponsored by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, a group concerned with the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, according to previous PJA chair Emily S. Unger ’13.
“We feel that these policies end up preventing dialogue [and] collaboration between Jewish and Palestinian groups and excluding some Jewish groups from the Jewish community based on their political views,” Unger said. “Hillel...should not exclude anyone from the community based on their politics.”
Harvard Hillel’s executive director Jonah C. Steinberg, who Unger said has met with the PJA several times to discuss Hillel’s policy, wrote in an email that although he believes it is important for students to participate in discussions about Israel that engage multiple perspectives, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions campaign “is out of keeping with that aim because it encourages alienation rather than constructive connection in relation to Israel.”
“I firmly believe that there is a very important distinction to be drawn between allowing and fostering dialogue, on the one hand, and underwriting and supporting institutional partnerships with [boycott, divestment, and sanctions] campaigns, on the other,” Steinberg wrote in an email to Harvard Hillel’s board members Jan. 31.
Unger said she hopes that if enough people sign the online petition, the PJA will be able to convince the Harvard Hillel Board to modify its rules to make them more inclusive.
Harvard’s campaign has already garnered attention from student groups on other college campuses. According to Unger, the PJA is in contact with students at Tufts University, Brown University, Binghamton University, and Brandeis University who also hope to change international Hillel policies. The petition on Open Hillel’s website is open to all and has been signed by people identifying as students from a variety of schools including Tufts, Temple University, and the University of California, San Diego.
“We’re trying to make it so that Hillel is open to more people. We’re not protesting Hillel,” said Unger. “One of Hillel’s central values is pluralism, and we think that should be extended to political views on Israel as well as to religious pluralism.”

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences awaits its planned move across the river to Allston, the school is in search of short term solutions to immediate problems created by a lack of space.
In anticipation of Tuesday’s announcement, last month SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray appointed a space steering committee to inform decisions about the school’s long-term space needs.
The committee will meet with architectural consultants to provide input on the design process of SEAS’s Allston presence, said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68—one of the co-chairs of the committee. The new campus will eventually be located in Harvard’s science complex, construction on which is slated to resume in 2014 and should be completed in late 2017 or early 2018.
Murray has also tasked the committee with investigating short-term solutions to SEAS’ space needs while it awaits the completion of its Allston facilities. Beginning in March and continuing into the summer, SEAS will relocate several of its administrative offices to a temporary space at 20 University Rd. in Harvard Square, referred to by Executive Dean G. Timothy Bowman as “SEAS South.”
Bowman wrote in an email to The Crimson that the move will serve as a short-term “Band Aid” solution for the school’s immediate space needs.
“Moving these offices to 20 University Road will free up some space, addressing our pressing need to accommodate existing research and provide modern, studio-style classrooms and teaching labs right away for our undergraduate courses,” Bowman wrote.
The temporary location will house the staff of SEAS’s finance, research administration, human resources, communications, and development offices.
Lewis said the creation of SEAS South demonstrates the current crunch on space resources felt by the school.
“It’s evidence for why the big move [to Allston] is happening,” Lewis said. “In order to make room for faculty growth and so on, they have to free up some office space around here.”
Professor David A. Weitz, the other co-chair of the committee, said he felt a sense of urgency because of the space challenges facing SEAS.
“SEAS is crowded, there’s no space,” Weitz said. “We can’t do research, we can’t teach.”
He added that even so, he was optimistic about the school’s eventual move to Allston.
“There’s only one challenge in my view, and that’s to make sure that SEAS remains part of the University,” Weitz said.
“As long as we overcome that, there’s no challenges, there’s only excitement and opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Wednesday night, Allston residents criticized Harvard’s proposed relocation of some campus services, a move which they say intrudes into a residential area.
About 75 members of the Allston-Brighton community packed into a Business School lecture hall for the meeting, which also touched on University-funded community benefits in Allston and mixed-use developments at Barry’s Corner.
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, spoke about Harvard’s intentions for its land in the neighborhood and fielded questions about the University’s plans for construction and its commitment to community benefits.
Casey kicked off the meeting by addressing the University’s decision to relocate the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to the planned science complex across the Charles River, a move which University President Drew G. Faust announced at a faculty meeting on Tuesday. Casey said that Harvard will not, as some residents feared, build a development for SEAS beyond the bounds of the proposals it has already submitted to the city of Boston.
Some residents argued that while the University is being very specific about plans for its own buildings, it has been much less forthcoming with details of projects intended to benefit the community, such as the Education Portal.
The conversation became particularly heated when it turned to Harvard’s plan to move some of its facilities from 219 Western Ave. to 28 Travis St. Critics took issue primarily with Harvard’s plan to relocate its “fleet management” services to the Travis Street site, which is adjacent to several residential lots. Residents requested that it be moved elsewhere, saying they were worried the plan would increase noise, traffic, and pollution in the neighborhood.
“Harvard is proposing to move a maintenance facility on the periphery of our neighborhood into our neighborhood,” said Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alfred.
The campus services that would be housed at 28 Travis St. would include mailroom and information technology services, a Harvard police training area, and recycling, storage, and fleet management services.
Casey said that the Travis Street location is the only viable place for the facilities and described changes to the plans that he said will address residents’ concerns. A new building for vehicle management, Casey said, will act as a buffer between homes and the loading zones, while a new layout will close off access to Travis Street from the loading area, doubling green space along the road and lessening noise and traffic for the homes across the street.
Still, some residents were not satisfied with the University’s proposed solution.
“You would walk your children next to a park with all of that?” Alfred asked.
The relocation is part of much larger series of plans for Allston that include the construction of a new science complex, a new basketball arena, a hotel and conference center, and other academic and administrative buildings. Harvard first filed a proposal for development with the city in 2007, but halted construction in 2009 because of the economic downturn, a move which angered residents in Allston and Brighton.
Harvard announced last summer that it would resume development in the neighborhood and has since filed new, shorter-term plans than the ones it pursued before the recession.

After two close opening games, freshman Saumya Karki and sophomore Julianne Chu found themselves playing catch-up. But Harvard’s No. 5 and No. 8 rallied to win each of their next three games, as the No. 2 Crimson women’s squash team (10-1, 4-1 Ivy) swept the second wave to clinch a 7-2 team victory over No. 4 Trinity (14-2).
“I couldn’t be happier with the team’s performance today,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “Individually, [in] each match a lot of girls who have been kind of working on certain areas of weakness really stepped up today and really proved that they are really learning from every match and building.”
Harvard sealed the deal during the second rotation of the night, as wins from Chu, Karki, and No. 2 Laura Gemmell put the Crimson up, 5-1. Although the wave was Harvard’s only perfect rotation, it produced some of the Crimson’s closest match-ups of the evening.
Gemmell defeated Bantams junior tri-captain Catalina Palaez in four closely-contested sets at the No. 2 position, 12-10, 10-12, 11-8, 11-7. Gemmell and Harvard No. 1 Amanda Sobhy remain undefeated this year.
At the No. 5 position, Karki dropped her first game before taking three tight sets to best Trinity tri-captain Robyn Hodgson, 8-11, 11-8, 11-9, 11-9.
Chu similarly gritted out four close games at the No. 8 position to earn Harvard’s decisive fifth win of the night. The sophomore edged Bantams junior Jennifer Pellentier, 8-11, 11-8, 12-10,11-8.
“They were able to come back and win, which showed really good character,” freshman Michelle Gemmell said of Chu and Karki. “I was really proud of them.”
Harvard emerged victorious at the top five positions Wednesday evening. The Crimson opened with a strong 2-1 performance in the first wave.
At the No. 9 position, Isabelle Dowling defeated Trinity sophomore Chanel Erasmus, 11-7, 13-11, 11-7. Kingshott fell to Bantams sophomore Natalie Babjukova, 5-11, 11-6, 11-9, 11-9, at the No. 6 position.
At the No. 3 position, Haley Mendez took Harvard’s only five-game win of the night. The sophomore rallied from 1-0 to beat Trinity junior Wee Nee Low, 9-11, 11-7, 11-7, 6-11, 11-3.
After the Crimson sealed the win in the second wave, the final rotation was just a formality. But in an interesting development, Amanda Sobhy’s streak of perfection came to an end.
The sophomore skated through her rookie season, posting a perfect 15-0 record without losing a set and earning all-Ivy and Player and Rookie of the Year honors.
This year, she kept the streak going through four matches, starting each at the No. 1 position. Although she picked up her fifth win tonight, it came at the cost of her perfect collegiate record.
The reigning CSA champion dropped a game for the first time in her college career, as Trinity freshman Kanzy El Defrawy earned the first point at the No. 1 position Wednesday evening. Starting from an unfamiliar position, Sobhy nevertheless swept to victory with convincing wins in the next three games, defeating El Defrawy, 6-11, 11-2, 11-6, 11-3, to give Harvard its seventh and final individual match of the night.
Michelle Gemmell also won for the Crimson at the No. 4 position with a three-game win over Bantams sophomore Ashley Tidman, 11-8, 13-11, 11-6. Trinity freshman Sachika Balvani defeated Harvard co-captain Sarah Mumanachit, 5-11, 9-11, 11-5, 11-5, 11-8.
The win was Harvard’s first against a top-5 opponent after the Crimson’s 5-4 loss to Princeton earlier this month.
“I think it gives us a huge vote of confidence, especially after Princeton,” Kingshott said. “We put in so much work, identifying areas of improvement, and the performances of the team as a whole and in the individual matches was a testament to how strong our training has been.
“Trinity had a close match with Yale two weeks ago, so this was a good litmus test for us going into the weekend,” Kingshott added.
Harvard will visit Brown today before hosting Yale on Sunday to close out its regular season. The CSA Team Championships begin a week from this Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day after the anniversary of his emergence, Jeremy Lin ’10 had a banner night against the Golden State Warriors. Lin scored 28 points on just 16 shots and made a career-high five threes on the day, part of Houston’s 23 from beyond the arc. That mark tied an NBA record and was in large part due to Lin’s nine assists, which led the team.
 
On February 4, 2012, Lin—starting his first game for the New York Knicks—registered career highs in points, rebounds, and assists with a 25-5-7 line against the New Jersey Nets. Lin got the best of All-Star point guard Deron Williams and led the struggling Knicks to a 99-92 victory. His performance spurred of the beginning of Linsanity, a string of seven straight wins that culminated with Lin winning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after his first four starts and playing in the Rising Stars Challenge of the NBA’s All-Star Weekend before getting injured later in the season and missing the playoffs.
 
Lin, who was waived by both the Rockets and the Warriors before the 2011 season, famously lived on his cousin’s couch when he first got to New York—not expecting to stay in the city long enough to need an apartment. After star Carmelo Anthony urged coach Mike D’Antoni to play the Harvard graduate, he became an instant sensation in D’Antoni’s wide-open offense—which caters well to Lin’s specific skill set and allowed him to flourish. 
 
After the season, restricted free agent Lin was encouraged by the Knicks to seek other offers but was expected to resign with the team. Nate Silver wrote in the New York Times that Lin had been worth nearly $600 million to the team since his emergence but after Houston Rockets general manager offered Lin a hefty contract that would have cost the Knicks a sizable amount in luxury tax payments, they chose to let Lin go and replaced him with a combination of Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd.
 
Lin has struggled in Houston to adapt to a new offense in which he is playing off the ball. The team’s trade for James Harden right before the season meant that Lin could not dominate the ball as he did in New York. Lin had adjusted as a spot-up shooter and is rebounding and assisting at roughly the same rate as last year and cut his turnovers at the same time. He leads a surprising Rockets team that currently holds a playoff spot in the ultra-competitive West. His three-point percentage is down overall but has increased by at least thirty points each month and this month he is shooting 5-10 from behind the arc. 
 
At the age of 24, Lin has vanished from the limelight that pursued him in New York. The storylines are abundant—as a Harvard graduate and the first Asian-American star since Yao Ming, he has generated a lot of publicity (and controversy, with racially insensitive remarks after his emergence)—but he has a long way to grow. Lin was +37 in plus/minus on Tuesday, his best performance of the year in that category and a sign of future growth. His story is only a year old, but it is far from over.

Freshmen who had not yet grown accustomed to life at Harvard were made a little more so Wednesday evening when they learned their formal dance, previously scheduled for Friday, had been postponed. The cause: a blizzard. Yes, that's right, a blizzard. Forty-five mile per hour winds, feet of snow, near zero visibility—the works. (An Act of God, you ask? Probably not this time, but only time will tell.)
 
Citing transportation hazards and a possible MBTA closure, the freshmen events committee assured students it would announce the date of the rescheduled dance next week. 
For those wondering if the cancellation is legitimate, Flyby has some stats on the coming storm: the National Weather Service in Boston has forecasted as much as 18 to 24 inches of snow in eastern Massachusetts. To drive this point home further, this is likely more snow than the average Texan sees in his or her lifetime. (We say 'likely' because who knows what global warming will really bring?)
 
To those rare freshmen who have been anticipating the tipsy T-surfing, copious chocolate fountains, and a ballroom much too large for a group that just wants to dance really, really close together, we say—what could be more fun than being trapped in the Yard? Occupy liked it. And the snow won't start until Friday, so there's no risk of missing classes or being distracted from catching up on that reading you're already behind on. Formal dances can be rescheduled; blizzards come but once each year. (Unless it's 2011 or you live in Wisconsin.)
Sections
During a recent tumble through cyberspace, Flyby came across this old photograph of Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., brother of President John F. Kennedy '40, chilling in Winthrop's Gore courtyard. The acronym that never was, JPK graduated from Harvard in 1938 and attended Harvard Law School before enlisting in the Navy during World War II (he was later killed in action). Here, Joe keeps things classy but casual in a sport coat while reminding us that our genes will never be as good-looking as his. If you're suffering from a particularly strong case of Kennedy nostalgia, head over to Winthrop House and sit where JPK once sat. The JFK Suite is located just a few yards away, in F entryway.

If you're tired of spending night after night at a Grafton Group Restaurant or sick of wandering up and down Mt. Auburn Street searching for a party, look no further. The Sinclair, a new concert venue and restaurant located at 52 Church St., has opened its doors to the Square.
 
The Sinclair is the newest concert venue backed by The Bowery Presents, the New York-based booking company behind such iconic spaces as the Bowery Ballroom and Terminal 5. Now, for the price of a movie ticket, you can go see a concert in the Square and possibly splurge for a nice meal afterward. 
 
The Harvard Square location presented a unique challenge to The Bowery Presents because of Cambridge's puritanical liquor laws, which forbid nightclub licenses; businesses cannot serve alcohol without food. In the face of such restrictions, Bowery decided to go into the restaurant business at The Sinclair, a bold move for a company that had never done so before.
 
The resulting space—part restaurant, part concert venue—provides a unique addition to a Square in need of new nightlife options. Though Harvard Square lacks nightclubs like New Haven's ubiquitous Toad's Place (and doesn't even have a movie theater, for that matter), The Sinclair concert venue may begin to fill that void with a large wraparound balcony, a maximum capacity of 525 people, and, most importantly, three bars.
 
In order to attract students, The Sinclair has worked to provide affordable concerts and meals for its patrons. According to Josh Bhatti, the head of Bowery Presents: Boston, 80 percent of the concerts at the Sinclair cost less than 20 dollars. "We wanted our prices to be accessible so that people can come back multiple times," Bhatti says. In addition, very few concerts have a 21-plus age restriction, making it easier for students to attend. Unfortunately, one does have to be 21+ to enjoy the three bars.
Check out FM's full review of the Sinclair here, and visit the magazine landing page for more FM content.
