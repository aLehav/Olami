After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know it's January when everyone, including you, is on some quest for self-improvement. Forget about the gym for a while, however, and concentrate on 2013's new book releases. This year promises exciting novels from established writers, so reading more this year should be an easy resolution to keep.
George Saunders, "Tenth of December," January 8
The genius whom you've never read is at it again with another collection of stories. The quintessential writers' writer, Saunders is still far from being a household name despite having received numerous authorial accolades. Previous publications like "CivilWarLand in Bad Decline" and "In Persuasion Nation" contained accounts of dystopian universes and exaggerated satires of contemporary society; Saunders' new work promises to be no different.
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, "Americanah," May 14
The award-winning Nigerian author of "Half of a Yellow Sun" is set to return with her first proper novel in seven years. "Americanah" will chronicle two star-crossed lovers, Ifemelu and Obinze, forced to flee a Nigeria full of military unrest. While Ifemelu is able to build a new life in America, Obinze is refused entry to the country; instead, he leads a dangerous life in London's underground. When the two lovers find each other back in Nigeria fifteen years later, it remains to be seen whether geographical closeness will lead to emotional reconciliation.
Khaled Hosseini, "And the Mountains Echoed," May 21
Remember that book called "The Kite Runner?" The one that found its way into every book club and high school English class in the country? Hosseini's second (and, in our opinion, far less nuanced) novel, "A Thousand Splendid Suns," also made quite a splash. His third novel, "And the Mountains Echoed," is due out in May; like its predecessors, it will be centered around themes of family, chronicling an intergenerational tale of sacrifice and triumph.
Neil Gaiman, "The Ocean at the End of the Lane," June 18
Gaiman fans, rejoice: just when you thought he decided to stick with children's books, the terrifyingly prolific author is set to release a new novel aimed at adults this summer. According to Amazon, "The Ocean at the End of the Lane" won't stray far from Gaiman tropes like fairies, necromancy, and the generally macabre.
Thomas Pynchon, "The Bleeding Edge," TBA
Pynchon writes doorstops of novels about esoteric subjects like the Mason-Dixon Line and Nazi rockets, but that hasn't stopped the literary world from shaking with excitement at the prospect of another one of his novels. Despite the popularity of works like "Gravity’s Rainbow" and "The Crying of Lot 49," Pynchon has maintained his reclusive proclivities throughout his novelistic career, rarely allowing himself to be photographed or interviewed. It should come as no surprise, then, that the plot of the novel, along with its release date, remains unknown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MEMPHIS—In the second half of the Harvard men's basketball team's matchup with Memphis, freshman point guard Siyani Chambers took it inside the paint and secured a layup for the Crimson, leveling the score for the first time at 44-44.
After a defensive rebound with eight minutes remaining, the visitors looked to take their first lead of the game. Sophomore forward Moundou-Missi secured the Harvard lead with a dunk, but the moment was short-lived, as Tigers forward D.J. Stephens answered with two points of his own for Memphis. The Tigers (14-3) never allowed another Crimson (9-6) lead, ultimately winning, 60-50.
“I was really proud of the guys—how we fought back to really make it a game and actually take the lead in this game,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We did some really good things in the second half. The way we started the game, we were knocked on our heels with their energy and their effort right away. I thought that was the difference.”
Harvard had a tough go of things in the first half, committing 13 turnovers and going 5 of 19 on field-goal attempts before heading into the locker room at the end of the first period down 32-16 at the FedEx Forum.
“I felt like we weren’t aggressive,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We weren’t doing what we’ve been doing the whole season. Obviously on the backboard they got too many offensive rebounds, and we weren’t able to get in the paint at all, and that really hurt us a lot.”
Webster led the Crimson in the first half with two steals and five points, three of which came from an on-target shot far outside the arc with 12:26 remaining in the half. Junior co-captain Laurent Rivard sunk the Crimson’s second and final three-pointer of the period in the 15th minute of the first half.
Harvard's defense struggled to defend freshman forward Shaq Goodwin, who led the Tigers with eight points and five assists heading into halftime. The Crimson failed to protect the paint, allowing Memphis players to score 20 points down low.
Harvard finished the period shooting 26 percent, well below the Memphis field goal percentage of 36. The Crimson only registered one offensive rebound.
“[Memphis] played very well,” Amaker said. “I think they came out and played incredibly hard and put us on our heels…and I thought it really hurt us right away. We needed to take care of the ball, and we needed to box out and keep them off the backboard.”
Harvard gained momentum in the second period with an 11-0 run spanning four minutes. Chambers scored two points on a jumper with 16:08 minutes remaining, bringing the score to 36-24.
Memphis failed to answer offensively, and sophomore forward Wesley Saunders extended the Crimson scoring streak with a three-pointer and a layup heading into the fifth minute of the half. The Tigers’ Joe Jackson cut the Harvard streak short by finishing an old-fashioned three-point play, putting the Crimson deficit at seven points.
“We just tried to relax, just play our game,” Webster said. “It wasn’t really about X’s and O’s. It was just about digging in and actually playing. I feel like we were tense [in the first half]. I don’t know if it was the big arena or what, but I felt like we were not being ourselves, and that’s what we tried to do in the second half.”
With five straight points, Rivard decreased the Tigers' lead to five, 44-39. After Saunders sunk two free throws of his own, the Tigers suffered a turnover on offense, allowing the Crimson another attempt on offense.
“I thought we showed a lot of fight—a lot of toughness—just to get back into the game, “ Webster said. “And with a team like Memphis, you can’t dig a hole for yourself.”
A dunk from Crawford with six seconds remaining was the final basket, ending the game with a 10-point Crimson loss.
“I think [the Tigers] are as good as advertised,” Amacker said. “They’re explosive, they’re athletic."
Saunders led Harvard with 11 points and three steals, while Moundou-Missi chipped in with 10 points. Chambers directed the offense, registering seven assists by the end of the matchup, but also finishing with seven turnovers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team found itself facing tough competition in No. 6 Cornell on Saturday at the Malkin Athletic Center. And although the Crimson remained in contention entering the final match, the team ultimately fell to the Big Red, 24-15.
The meet was tied, 9-9, at the midway point, but Cornell pulled away by winning three of the final five matches, two by falls, to secure the bonus points that would help decide the contest.
Although all of the Big Red’s wrestlers had winning records, with four ranked within the top 15 of their respective weight classes, Harvard was able to win five of the ten matches on the night.
“I just thought that every one of our guys wrestled hard,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “And that’s all I asked of them going into the match. I said that I don’t care about outcome; I just want you to focus on maximum effort and try to do something a little extraordinary. And I think they did, and that’s going to really help us.”
Freshman Jeff Ott started the evening off against Nahshon Garrett of Cornell. Although Ott led after the first period, Garrett went on an 11-1 run to seal the victory and his second win of the year over the Crimson freshman.
After Harvard sophomore Ryan Osleeb managed to snag a tight 3-2 victory at 133 lbs, co-captain Steven Keith was dominant from start to finish and to defeat his opponent, 8-1. The two consecutive victories gave Harvard a 6-4 lead.
“If we wrestle that way with that kind of intensity, hard for seven minutes, taking it to whoever we’re wrestling, [then] we’re going to break a lot of teams and hopefully pull out some wins against some good teams,” sophomore James Fox said.
But the Big Red fought back to seize the advantage as Chris Villalonga secured bonus points with a technical fall over freshman Todd Preston.
Although he was nearly pinned at the end of the final period, Crimson co-captain Walter Peppelman managed to hang on and earn his 99th career victory in a 1-0 decision.
With the score tied at nine apiece, Harvard freshman Devon Gobbo was sent out to take on three-time national champion and No. 1 Kyle Dake, who pinned Gobbo in the second minute. Dake has needed just over three total minutes to pin each of his three Ivy League opponents so far this season.
At 174 lbs, junior Cameron Croy edged out the Big Red’s Marshall Peppelman, younger brother of the Crimson’s Walter, by a score of 4-3.
“We were winning those close bouts, and you like to see that,” Weiss said. “Because when the pressure mounts, you have to be able to perform at your best, and I think our guys did.”
Fourth-ranked Steve Bosak, a defending national champion, came out strong and pinned sophomore Josh Popple of Harvard to push the Cornell lead to nine.
In the penultimate match of the day, Fox snagged an 8-5 victory in a back-and-forth bout at 197 lbs, and the Crimson still found itself with a chance to win going into the heavyweight battle. But sophomore David Ng was not able to take down his opponent and fell, 4-2, to seal the Big Red victory.
The wrestlers had the opportunity to perform in an electric environment on Saturday. The bleachers at the MAC were completely full, and some onlookers were forced to either stand or sit on the floor.
“The atmosphere was awesome,” Fox said. “That was as packed as I’ve seen the MAC, and coach said that’s packed as he’s seen the MAC in his twenty years here. We were definitely able to feed off the energy…. I wish all home matches look like that from now on…because it was amazing.”
Harvard was Cornell’s second opponent of the day, as the Big Red arrived in Cambridge fresh off a 35-6 victory over Brown in Providence just five hours earlier.
Losing by nine points to a team of Cornell’s caliber, which has gone 2-2 against schools ranked in the top ten so far this year, is viewed by the Crimson as a step in the right direction.
“I think we’re definitely encouraged, but at the same time we want to be a team like Cornell; that’s why we’re in the business,” Weiss said. “I think this has got to help the guys. Yes, we are encouraged, but we know we have more to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its first loss in nearly two years, the Harvard women’s squash team wasn’t about to let defeat become a pattern.
Following a narrow 5-4 loss to Princeton last week, the second-ranked Crimson (7-1, 2-1 Ivy) took on no. 16 Hamilton (2-6) and no. 9 Amherst (8-4) at the Pioneer Round Robin at the Jeffs’ Davenport Courts. Harvard bounced back from its only loss of the season in decisive fashion on Saturday afternoon, sweeping both teams for a combined 18-0 tally.
“We came out really strong, and I think the results speak for themselves,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “Especially coming off of a tough weekend, we really looked at this week to regroup and look forward, and I think that these matches, although they’re not quite the same test that our Ivy matches are, inspire us to keep moving forward as we approach Columbia and Cornell in two weeks and Trinity and Yale.”
The interlude between Ivy play not only gave the Crimson a chance to rebound from the Tigers, but also offered an opportunity to give less experienced players a chance to compete as part of the nine scoring matches.
“It’s a wonderful opportunity for girls on the low end of the ladder to get competitive matches,” Kingshott said. “Only the top nine play, but we do have a roster of 16, and the girls at the bottom put in as many hours and contribute as much to the team as the top nine, so for a lot of the girls to step up and show the hard work that they put in is really wonderful.”
Although last week’s setback at the hands of Princeton was foreign to a team that hadn’t lost since 2011, assistant coach Luke Hammond notes that the match gave the team pieces to work on that led to the victories this weekend.
“I think the confidence has been coming back for many of them individually all week,” Hammond said. “We’ve been going back, working on things, working on the mental aspect of the game and really trying to work everybody back to top form. A bunch of the girls who didn’t play well against Princeton have been playing better over the course of the week, so we’re feeling pretty good now.”
HARVARD 9, AMHERST 0
After routing the Continentals earlier in the day, the Crimson continued its show of dominance, dropping only three games en route to its 9-0 victory over the home team.
The closest contests came at the bottom of the ladder, in the matches of eighth-seeded junior Natasha Anzik and ninth-seeded junior Georgiana Brinkley. Anzik won the first game but dropped the next two before coming back strong to take the fourth and fifth games, downing her opponent, 3-2. Brinkley scored a 3-1 victory, losing her third game before notching an 11-4 victory in the fourth.
“For Natasha Anzik and Georgie Brinkley to get time on court today and really have a full team out in support for them was great,” Kingcott said.
Despite playing Hamilton just a few hours before taking to the courts to face Amherst, the team showed little sign of fatigue, with its top seven posting shutouts across the board.
“Some weekends [fatigue] can be a factor, but this weekend I don’t think it was too bad,” Hammond said. “We had a couple hours for lunch, so they weren’t too close together. It was a pretty early wakeup call, they had to wake up at 6 AM, so there was that factor, but I don’t think the kids were too tired.”
Freshman Isabelle Dowling, who moved from the no. 8 spot to the fourth seed, played two hotly contested games against her opponent, winning her first and third games, 12-10.
HARVARD 9, HAMILTON 0
The Crimson started out its day with a rout over the Continentals, winning each match 3-0. The battle was the first ever between Harvard and Hamilton.
“I don’t remember ever playing Hamilton before, so it’s always good to play new schools,” senior Laura Gemmel said. “Everyone was excited, it’s always exciting to play a team for the first time.”
Despite not playing the normally top-seeded sophomore Amanda Sobhy or fifth-seeded Saumya Karki, Harvard had no problems taking care of business against Hamilton, with the closest game coming in an 11-8 victory for Dowling in her shutout of Isabelle Weisman.
“[Sitting out Sobhy and Karki] was really to do with the fact that we want those girls who are usually right on the edge of being able to play in the nine,” Hammond said. “We like to get them into the official nine if we can. But we still have to respect them and be careful with Hamilton and Amherst, because those are two good teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Still in search of its first league win of 2013, the Harvard men’s hockey team dropped a 5-2 contest to its oldest rival, Brown, Saturday evening at the Meehan Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island.
The last time the Crimson (5-10-1, 3-8-0 ECAC) squared off against the Bears (6-8-4, 2-5-4 ECAC), the then-13th ranked Harvard squad defeated Brown for its third straight win, and looked poised to make a strong run in the 2012-2013 campaign.
Since then, the Crimson has struggled to find consistency, losing its sixth straight ECAC game since its win against Cornell back in mid-November. Harvard’s lone victory since that win came in last week’s overtime thriller against BU.
The Bears rode a four-goal outburst in the second period to come away with a win that propels Brown above the now last place Crimson in the ECAC standings.
“I thought we played a good first period, we outshot them and we won a majority of the face-offs,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “In the second [period] they outplayed us, they outworked us, they beat us to pucks in the scoring areas, they had multiple whacks at pucks, the game certainly was decided in the second period.”
The Crimson was able to open the scoring with a goal from sophomore Tommy O’Regan at 2:04 early in the second, with freshman Brian Hart finding the forward on a two-on-one from the right circle.
But the Bears netted four straight goals thereafter, knotting the score at one less than a minute after O’Regan’s goal. The visitors did not score until the end of the second period, where Hart made it 4-2, but Brown did not let Harvard come any closer as it closed out the game in the third to split the season series at one.
Soon after the Crimson initiated the scoring, Brown sophomore Matt Lorito broke the puck away from the defense near the left crease, wrapped it around the net and passed it up to junior Garnet Hathaway in front of the net, who buried the shot for his second goal of the year.
The Bears then pulled away with two quick goals in a span of just over a minute with goals by senior Chris Zaires and sophomore Ryan Jacobson. Zaires was able to score after the puck bounced around a bit on a rebound from a shot off a faceoff, while Jacobson found the left side of the net open after a crisp pass from Lorito on the right.
Brown finally made it 4-1 after a pass up from behind the net from Dennis Robertson found Lorito open in center; the team’s leading scorer then fired a shot on net, and the rebound bounced out to Nick Lappin who put it in for the power-play goal.
Throughout the game the Bears were strong in front of the net, winning many battles against Harvard on both sides of the ice.
“The [Brown] forwards were playing hard and going to the net and getting a lot of rebounds,” Hart said. “I thought they were good in front of our net and that’s where we need to get better.”
Shutout in the last three games on the power play, the Crimson finished 0-5 on the evening.
“We’ve had some good looks but we just haven’t been consistent,” Donato said. “We haven’t been able to get pucks through from the point I think that’s been a killer. [There’s been a] ton of shot blocked, and then when we have we haven’t really won any the battles in front of the net or rebounds so that’s something that we’ll have to improve on greatly if we’re going to have some success.”
Harvard was able to respond at the end of the period with a goal by Hart assisted by fellow freshman forward Jimmy Vesey and junior defenseman Dan Ford on a four-on-four opportunity to the lead to two.
But Brown halted any momentum the Crimson was trying to build with a goal by senior Jeff Ryan midway through the third period to put the Bears back up by three. His shot clanged off the top right bar and went in after a pass from the left circle from Zaires.
“We just wanted to come right of the bat hard and see if we can get a goal,” Hart said. “We had that big comeback versus BU so we had a little life, but that fifth goal was a little devastating, we were just starting to get going in the third and they scored there.”
Overall, Brown outshot Harvard, 35-28. Freshman Peter Traber stopped 30 in the loss while Bear Anthony Borelli saved 26 of the Crimson’s shots to clinch the victory.
Harvard will continue its search for its first league win of 2013 next week, with a quick turnaround and game away at Union.
“We are just going to keep working," Hart said, “We have a lot of skill and talent on this team and we just got to put it all together. We got a game Tuesday so hopefully we can move on from this and play well Tuesday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Watching the Harvard women’s hockey team face Union Saturday, you wouldn’t believe that it was the Crimson’s lowest-scoring win this season.
Harvard (16-1-1, 16-0 ECAC) dominated the possession game at Bright Hockey Arena, keeping the puck in the attacking zone for most of the contest and pounding shot after shot at Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg. The Crimson extended its fourteen-game unbeaten streak in a 1-0 shutout, a far cry from the 9-0 victory over the Dutchwomen (17-14-3, 0-9-3 ECAC) it collected earlier this month.
“I have to say that they definitely stepped it up defensively, and their goaltender was much more ready to go this time around,” said co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey, who tallied Harvard’s only goal. “We embarrassed them last time with a 9-0 win, so they were definitely not going to let that happen again.”
After 22 shots in 35 minutes of scoreless play, the Crimson finally found the back of the net in the second period. With Dutchwoman forward Stefanie Thomson in the penalty box for boarding, sophomore defender Sarah Edney received a pass from sophomore forward Samantha Reber and took a shot from the top of the zone.
Unlike the other 34 times Harvard took it to the net during the game, Lundberg was not able to hold onto the puck and make the save. As it bounced off her pads, Dempsey was there to finish the play from the left side.
“One of our focuses before the game was that we wanted to score on the power play,” Dempsey said. “Edney was at the blue line, and she took a great shot from the point, and I was just able to be there for the rebound.”
Dempsey’s goal was the only time Harvard would find its way past Lundberg, who let in six goals in the last matchup between the two teams. Playing behind a strong defense that crowded the attacking zone, Lundberg made acrobatic stops that kept the Crimson off the board in the first period.
Harvard’s best looks came early in the frame, when senior forward Lyndsey Fry—who led the Crimson with seven shots—attempted a wrap-around from the left side that ricocheted off Dutchwoman defender Haley Welch. Fry caught the rebound and fired it straight back into Lundberg, and she added two more shots before the first five minutes of the game had elapsed.
“We were moving it around, but the thing is, you can cycle it and keep it on the outside all day long,” Fry said. “At the end of the day, we have to get to the net and get more pucks in the net. We had a lot of shots, and they weren’t going in for us today, but all we needed was one.”
Harvard’s defense looked untouchable in the first 10 minutes of the frame, as they outshot Union, 12-0, to open the game. The Dutchwomen’s best chance came early in the second period, with sophomore forward Hillary Crowe off the ice for tripping. Union defenders Kelly Norton and Maddy McGrath alternated on four consecutive shots that were turned away by the Crimson’s remaining four skaters.
As the puck bounced around in front of the net, Dutchwoman defender Ashley Johnston took the final shot of the power play opportunity, which was stifled by Harvard goaltender Laura Bellamy—who notched seven saves and leads the country with a 96.8 percent save percentage. With the penalty kill—the first of two on the night—the Crimson’s nation-leading record improved to 56-of-58.
In the second period, the Crimson looked more aggressive in front of the net, driving to the goal and taking shots from close. With Crowe back on the ice, Harvard pounded the attack zone with ten consecutive shots, finally drawing the penalty that led to its power-play goal. With Union a man down, it took the Crimson only 17 seconds to find the back of the net.
“We tried to just find a way to get pucks in and just get different looks at the net, get some traffic going, but it was difficult,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said.
Union got one last look at the end of the third period after pulling Lundberg to add an extra skater, but Dutchwoman defender Alex Tancrell-Fontaine’s Hail Mary shot with seconds on the clock went wide, and the Crimson extended its home winning streak to a full calendar year in its ninth shutout of the season.
“The composure we had at the end, that’s something positive that we were really happy about,” Dempsey said. “These experiences, we’re grateful for these later down the line because we’d rather have them under our belt and know what it’s like to be in those tough situations now instead of in a one-game elimination.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the majority of the first thirteen minutes, senior goaltender Laura Bellamy stood in the net, waiting for pucks to come her way. When the seven shots on goal that Union (17-14-3, 0-9-3 ECAC) managed finally did find their way towards the nation’s leading score-stopper, Bellamy took care of business, shutting out the Dutchwomen in a 1-0 victory.
The win is the sixteenth consecutive for Harvard (16-1-1, 16-0 ECAC) at the Bright Hockey Arena, a place in which the squad has not lost since January 20, 2012.
Bellamy’s counterpart, Union goaltender Shenae Lundberg, had a much busier day in net as the Crimson pummeled her with five pucks in the first three minutes en route to 35 shots on goal for the contest.
Although Harvard failed to convert on 34 of its scoring opportunities, Crimson defenders controlled the puck for much of the match, keeping it away from Bellamy and pushing it towards their attacking zone.
“We have very solid defense and very solid defensive forwards,” co-captain Jillian Dempsey said. “They did their job and our goalie did her job when she need to… Those are almost the hardest games to play for a goalie because you’re sitting around the whole game and then all of the sudden at the last minute they’re just peppering you.”
After a scoreless first period, Harvard came out firing to start the second, taking two shots in the first 40 seconds.  The lone goal of the game came out of a power-play opportunity, off of Dempsey’s stick.
“You have to get in to those dirty areas, you have to pay the price,” coach Katey Stone said. “I think we did a better job with it and made it a little tougher on them, but you know, a good game for us to win, a good game for us to try to figure out and challenge us, and one-goal games are hairy, and you have to be able to handle the pressure, and our kids did a good job.”
LUND-BELIEVABLE DEFENSE
In the earlier match-up between the Crimson and the Dutchwomen, Lundberg let six pucks escape her grasp, including two scores within five seconds of each other, causing the Union coach to bench her in the second period in favor of the second-string goaltender.
Saturday was a much different story for the netminder, as she turned away puck after puck to record a 0.971 save percentage on the day, rivaling Bellamy’s top-ranked save percentage of 0.968.
“Their goalie was on today, she was tremendous today,” Stone said. “That makes a huge difference with your confidence. You keep working your system when your goaltender’s making the saves she needs to make, and if that weren’t the case, they would have to be doing different things, but they were able to keep with their game plan because of how well she played.”
Dempsey denied Lundberg a shutout when the Dutchwomen were outnumbered on the ice due to a boarding penalty late in the second. Off of a missed shot, the co-captain collected the rebound and put it away to give Harvard the sole point on the scoreboard.
But this lead felt radically different than the one the Crimson held in the first meeting between the two teams, where Harvard gained a commanding six-point advantage by the end of the second period rather than hanging on to a one-point difference.
“I have my hats off to Union and their goaltender and how well they played in front of the net,” Stone said. “They made it very, very difficult for us today, extremely frustrating. It’s one of those games where you just never know if you keep it close for too long.”
A CLEAN SLATE
Coming in averaging 3.7 penalties a game, the only statistic in which the Crimson did not best its opponents, Harvard was looking to reduce the number of scoring opportunities it allowed Union.
“We’re not a dirty team,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “We’re not going to take cheap shots at all. We really focus on keeping our sticks down and moving our feet so that they can’t call penalties on us. With that said, definitely today, they’re a team that works really hard, and when you have two teams that work as hard as we do, you’re not going to have a lot of penalties because a lot of the penalties are either cheap shots, which neither of us do.”
The goal was accomplished as the Crimson incurred only one penalty during the match and killed it. Although Harvard leads the ECAC in penalty kill percentages at 96.1 percent, Stone notes the effort that her team makes to avoid man-down situations.
“We’re a skating team and we’ll… do it the right way,” Stone said. “If we have to kill some penalties we will, but I think we’re doing a good job of controlling ourselves and playing good defense.”

Following a 3-0 sweep at the Stevens Institute of Technology on Friday night, the Harvard men’s volleyball repeated a dominant performance and blanked New York University, 3-0, on Saturday at the Jerome S. Coles Center. The two teams had last met in 2011, when the Crimson fell in five sets, not one of which was decided by more than five points.
Harvard (2-0) was propelled against the Violets (0-1) by a group effort that saw all but three members of the team receive playing time.
“These pre-league matches are important in that way,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “It’s a long season. A lot of different guys are going to play a role this year.”
While Harvard may have been aggressive on defense, stifling NYU to a -.047 hitting percentage as a team and out-blocking its opponents 12 to seven, the first set saw the Crimson squad give up 14 points on unforced errors, eight off serves, and six off kills.
“We worked on our serving a lot,” Baise said. “We know it’s an important part of our game and it’s always going to be a struggle... You can see a difference from the first to the second game. The second game we were really in control.”
Junior co-captain Nick Madden led the scoring effort for Harvard. The opposite hitter dished out a game-high 13 kills and the sole service ace for the team. Madden also dove for two digs and provided a pair of blocks.
Madden was followed by sophomore DJ White, who topped all scorers against the Ducks and had nine kills over the match. White was closely trailed by freshman outside hitter Branden Clemens and sophomore middle blocker Caleb Zimmick, who had six kills apiece. Zimmick snatched a game-high four blocks and Clemens, playing in his second-ever collegiate contest, had three.
“It feels great because it feels like all the work that I put in during high school has finally started to pay off,” Clemens said. “It feels great to be part of another team and it feels great to be playing.”
Clemens, who started two of the first three sets, has been the only freshman to start thus far this season.
The first set saw the Crimson hold a slim lead until a 10-3 run gave the team a six-point advantage, 21-15. Despite various errors over the next several plays, a pair of kills by Madden and an attack by Clemens, all assisted by co-captain Rob Lothman, brought Harvard to game point. A botched kill by Violets freshman Keith Waddell gave the Crimson the first frame, 25-21. Waddell, an outside hitter, led his team in scoring for the day, with six kills but eight errors.
Harvard jumped to an early lead in the second stanza off six NYU errors and a Clemens kill, 7-0. It was too late for the Violets, who had just six successful attacks throughout the set, and they were unable to contain the Crimson, who rolled over its opponents to take the second set, 25-13.
“I felt it went a lot better,” Clemens said. “We started making a lot less errors, especially serving errors. I feel like our overall team defense and blocking went a lot better.”
A final set saw a rallying effort by the NYU squad. The two teams hovered within one to two points of each other until the end of the game. A service error by White gave the Violets a point that tied the contest, 22-22. Harvard responded with a Madden kill and NYU once again set itself behind with an attack error by junior outside hitter Parker Kolodka. In a swift match point, White drilled a kill with help from senior setter Derek Jansma. Jansma set the entire third frame, handing out 13 assists. Lothman started the first two sets and finished with the match with a game-high 20 assists.
“We knew they were going to come out,” Baise said. “Third set is usually the toughest because the other team is fighting to save the match. I’m glad we got it. Now that I know we won I’m glad we got a little pressure on our guys. It was 22-all. It’s always interesting to see how we respond and we were able to get those last few points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team stood head and shoulders above its competition in a three-school meet with Brown (5-2, 2-2 Ivy) and Penn (3-3, 2-3) on Saturday, winning both match-ups by its largest point spreads since last season.
Competing in Providence, R.I., the Crimson (6-0, 5-0) had at least two swimmers or divers place in the top three in 11 out of the 16 events. Harvard soundly defeated the Bears, 208-92, and also topped the Quakers, 241-58.
Following an eight-day training trip to Puerto Rico and a match-up against Miami last weekend, the team was not granted any rest this week but continued its conditioning push.
“At this point in the season we’re pretty tired and run down,” junior captain Sara Li said. “We’re at the most intense part of our training right now, so I’m really proud of the team for really digging in and getting into the fighting spirit and racing no matter what. That was our goal for today, and I think we did a great job of that.”
The Crimson was led by Li, who took home first place in three individual events and contributed to a win in the 200-yard medley relay.
Li went on to capture the title in both the 50 free and the 100 free shortly after the relay. The junior was the only Harvard swimmer to finish in the top four in each of the two races.
But Li was not done yet, and she capped off her night by sailing past her competititon to win the 200 IM by nearly three seconds.
“I’m happy with how I did,” Li said. “I think a big part of it is owed to the team and the team mentality. Everyone gets each other fired up, so I’m really swimming for my teammates. That’s my biggest inspiration.”
Freshman Kendall Crawford was nearly as consistent as Li. Crawford was also part of the first-place 200 medley team and she swam the first leg for the 400 free relay squad that outstretched a fighting Brown team to the wall.
Crawford cruised to victory in the 200 back, where she was almost six seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.
The Crimson received another solid performance from freshman Danielle Lee, who took first in the 200 free. Four of the top five swimmers in the race were from Harvard.
In addition to her participation on the victorious 200 medley team, Lee secured her final win of the day in the 100 back. The freshman managed to edge out teammate Crawford, who owns the Crimson all-time record in the event.
Freshman Sherry Liu also stood out for Harvard, winning two races of her own. Liu’s margin of victory in the 1650 free was 18 seconds, with fellow freshmen Marlee Ehrlich and Margaret Ramsey finishing second and third, respectively.
“It’s hard to even pinpoint one [freshman] because they all work together, not only in the pool but as teammates, as people,” Li said. “All of them are really positive, they have great training attitudes, and we’ve all become really close. They’ve had a really positive impact on the team.”
Liu achieved similar success in the 500 free, taking first and missing her best time of the year by just a few tenths of a second.
On the diving side, captain Brittany Powell racked up the most points for the Crimson, finishing first in the 1-meter and second in the 3-meter to senior Teagan Lehrmann. Harvard placed four of the top five finishers in both events.
“For the diving, especially today, we haven’t been up against necessarily the best teams in the league yet,” Powell said. “So I think these have all been sort of like practice meets to try to get your dives consistent, but [our next meet] is going to be the real test of our mental acuity and our precision.”
The Crimson’s focus has been pinpointed on the match-up with Yale and Princeton, which will begin on Feb. 1. The competition features some of the best swimmers and divers in the Ivy League, and Harvard snapped Princeton’s 43-meet win streak last year.
“This is definitely the best preparation we can have, with two meets in one weekend,” Powell said. “HYP is a two-day meet, and [this weekend] prepares you mentally because if you had a tough day on the first day, or even if you had a great day, you need to forget about it and move on to your next races or your next day of diving. It’s going to be a dogfight and we’re going to have to fight for every single event.”
