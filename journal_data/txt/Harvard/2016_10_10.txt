After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How to Set a Fire and Why” by Jesse Ball
“How to Set a Fire and Why” sparks interest with its poster-esque design: The outstretched hand holding a lit match between the index finger and thumb offers excitement and rebellion and even hints at violence. The plot, which tells the story of a group of teenage arsonists “who are fed up with wealth and property,” only justifies the overt fire references. The cover’s matchbox, the illustrated flame, and the word “fire” in the title risk being excessive, but paired with an equally daring protagonist, Ball sets an artistically audacious first impression.
“Loner” by Teddy Wayne
At first glance, the cover of “Loner” looks unpolished and even unprofessional: Its asymmetry looks more reminiscent of a first draft than of an illustration that should provide a reader’s first impression. However, upon realization that the hand-drawn, misshapen shield is a take on Harvard’s very own Veritas crest, this imperfection is almost refreshing. Like the premise of the novel itself, in which the protagonist enters Harvard as a freshman and struggles to adjust to its social scene, the cover implies that such “elite schools”—ones that enthusiastically don a crest with an obscure Latin mantra—are not as perfect as they seem. “Loner” seems to promise a relatable explanation of these social and intellectual shortcomings.
“The Last Wolf” by László Krasznahorkai
This clean, modern cover perfectly matches the book’s interior: Krasznahorkai writes this story, in which a professor tells his life story to a bartender, in one single sentence. His innovative and refreshingly complex approach to storytelling instigates intellectual inquiry, just as contemporary art elicits many various interpretations. The colors—a cool, muted gray and modest yellow—and simplicity of design also reflect a modern European aesthetic, as “The Last Wolf” was originally written in Hungarian but was recently translated to English. Overall, the cover capitalizes on the notion of literature as innovation and art, both inside and out.
“Leaving Lucy Pear” by Anna Solomon
The serenity of the gradient ocean; the rocky, rural backdrop; and the peach-clad young woman slightly bent over her book not only create a visually stunning composition but also highlight the strengths of “Leaving Lucy Pear.” Its pastoral setting amidst a chaotic time, the elegant depiction of womanhood and femininity, and Solomon’s anapestic prose. The woman’s interaction with the script of the title suggests that she is indeed Lucy Pear, but the same ambiguity entices readers to open the novel to discover her identity (or perhaps this truth never reveals itself). Its muted color palette also invites a mood of discovery and interpretation on the part of both the protagonists and the readers.
“Nutshell” by Ian McEwan 
Based on the cover alone (yes, a literary faux pas), “Nutshell” suggests pages of calculus graphs or physics problems rather than an enticing novel. The cover completely misses the mark: The novel is supposedly filled with suspenseful twists and romantic betrayals, none of which the cover reflects. Instead, it supersedes McEwan’s elegant prose. There is definitely a beauty in simplicity (which seems to be the aim here), but with such a rich plot, why not do something more than a design reminiscent of high school textbooks?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As negotiations between Harvard and its dining workers continue without resolution, administrators are ratcheting up efforts to minimize campus disruption and calling for volunteers from the exempt employees within several of its schools to help out HUDS.
Sandra Parada, a staff assistant for Harvard’s Campus Services responsible for coordinating volunteers, wrote in an email that Harvard is “actively seeking for volunteers all across campus,” adding that the University is only looking for exempt employees. Exempt employees, such as freshman proctors, are not paid hourly or eligible for overtime pay.
“As we speak, I am receiving emails from colleagues offering to lend HUDS a hand,” Parada wrote.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan sent an email to FAS department administrators requesting exempt staff to aid dining hall managers as the strike continues.
“The dining halls are being staffed by HUDS managers, supplemented by Harvard colleagues from around the University who are pitching in to help with a shift or two,”  Kirwan wrote. “If you, or exempt staff in your department, are able to suspend some of your regular duties and instead lend a hand to HUDS, I know they would be most grateful.”
Harvard’s dining workers have reported to the picket lines each day since Wednesday, going on strike in response to a nearly fourth month-long bargaining process with the University that has thus far failed to produce a contract agreement.
The latest bargaining session between HUDS and the University on Saturday did not yield an agreement, and the two parties will meet again for their 22nd session Monday morning, according to Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
As the picketing continues, six of the 13 undergraduate dining halls closed for the weekend, and Harvard has enlisted a small cohort of temporary workers to staff those that remain open. Before the workers went on strike Wednesday, the University began stockpiling frozen food.
Harvard’s dining workers are receiving roughly $40 a day in compensation from their union— the Boston-based UNITE HERE Local 26—for the duration of the strike, Local 26 president Brian Lang told the Boston Globe.
Representatives from Harvard and Local 26 have disagreed about health benefits and wages over the course of negotiations. Local 26, often using Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment as a rallying cry, has called for the University to provide year-round work for interested employees and institute a “minimum guaranteed salary” of $35,000 for those workers, according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.
HUDS workers are laid off during the University’s recesses and are not able to draw unemployment because of the school’s status as a non-profit organization.
In response, the University offered workers a series of summer stipends between $150 and $250 dollars, which would be paid out weekly “even if there are no open shifts,” according to deLuzuriaga.
Harvard also proposed its dining workers enroll in the health benefits package that its largest union negotiated last winter. That plan would eliminate deductibles, increase copayments, and establish a new premium contribution tier for workers who make $55,000 or less annually, in which Harvard would contribute 87 percent of the premium of the lowest-cost plan. The plan would also fund a “flexible savings account” of $80 per year in 2018 and 2019, and $40 in 2020. Flexible savings accounts allow employees to pay “predictable” health expenses related to caring for a dependent with pre-tax dollars, thus lowering a worker's taxable income.
Harvard also extended a second option to the workers, in which the University would contribute the “equivalent cost of the Harvard University Group Health Enrollment premium” to a health insurance plan offered by Local 26. About 300 HUDS employees are currently enrolled in that plan.
