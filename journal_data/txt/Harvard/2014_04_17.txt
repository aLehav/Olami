 
It’s a fact: admissions rates at top colleges across the U.S. have declined dramatically in recent years. Elite schools like Harvard and Stanford rejected nearly 95 percent of the applicant pool for the class of 2018. But it isn’t that these schools admit fewer students; rather, it’s that these schools receive more applications than they ever have before. A number of factors contribute to this: a fear of the arbitrary nature of college admissions, a greater amount of financial aid available for low-income students, and the ease of pressing “submit” on the common app are only a few. Whatever the reason, though, many high school students these days feel pressured to apply to ten, fifteen, sometimes even close to twenty colleges to ensure that they won’t be disappointed when those admissions emails arrive.
 
 In light of the rising rate of rejections and the increasing number of extremely qualified applicants in an admissions pool, the inevitable question has arisen: should elite schools like Harvard increase class sizes in order to accommodate these changes? It’s a tantalizing prospect that simply involves increasing the number of beds available at the college so that more of these incredible students can be given the opportunity to study here. Unfortunately, though, this approach is far from practical and would only hurt the student body overall.

It’s important to remember that while Harvard is a massive research university as a whole, with top-tier graduate and professional schools included, the undergraduate portion—Harvard College—prides itself on being a smaller, liberal arts college. With nearly 7,000 undergraduates, Harvard College’s enrollment numbers are already on the upper end of the spectrum for a liberal arts college. To increase class size would be to forgo many of the important things a liberal arts education offers students, such as individualized attention from faculty and smaller course and section sizes. Smaller upperclassman seminars and tutorials, which are paramount to this style of learning, would likely be much more difficult to offer. Overall, students would be less able to engage in the interaction and discussion that plays such an instrumental role in a Harvard education.
 
 Then, of course, there are the economic and logistical issues that would accompany an increase in class size. Funding in all areas would have to be spread thinner in order to accommodate a larger student body. Student groups, which would undoubtedly become larger, would require greater funding for activities and efforts that Harvard could not provide. And the revolutionary financial aid program that makes Harvard so unique would not be as effective, since the scholarship money available would have to be spread between a greater number of accepted students.
 
 The issue here does not truly lie in the small number of students that elite colleges accept; rather, it lies in the culture of college admissions itself. These days, high school students and their parents place Ivy League institutions on such high pedestals, which only increases the pressure students feel to get accepted, and the sense of failure they experience if they aren’t. But the truth is that these outstanding students who are not accepted to elite colleges will instead populate other schools, thereby raising their standards. As a society, the only solution to this issue is to accept that Ivy League schools are not the only institutions that can provide brilliant students with an incredible and enlightening education. We must steer away from this obsession with big names and prestige, and instead convince applicants that there are many amazing options out there aside from the Ivies that will benefit from their presence.
 
 With admissions these days as competitive as they are, this is, of course, a tall order, but removing this weight from the shoulders of high-achieving high schoolers is undoubtedly the most feasible solution. A change in class size is not the answer; a change in perspective is.

Song cycles occupy a peculiar position in the arts world. Lacking plot or cohesive characters, they offer an opportunity for experimentation but may also be prone to poorer productions: stellar acting cannot substitute for lackluster vocal talents, poor directing cannot be overshadowed by plot or characters, and the ability to synthesize a common theme among many pieces becomes crucial. Fortunately for Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Songs for a New World,” which ran April 10 to April 12, most of these obstacles were overcome. 
 
“Songs for a New World” is a set of several musical vignettes that center on different people and their unique stories—some hopeful, some humorous. Without a central plot, the actors faced the difficult task of portraying different roles in every song. The performers met the challenge well, bringing dynamic interpretations to their various characters, which in less capable hands were in danger of being one-noted. Mastering the emotional nuances of two very different women in the production, Leah Reis-Dennis ’13 stood out. Initially portraying a disgruntled wife threatening to commit suicide in the first act’s “Just One Step,” Reis-Dennis was darkly humourous with her sudden wry—perhaps threatening—smiles and comic, forceful hand movements as her character chides her husband. On a much somber note, Reis-Dennis then transitioned into a reflective, skeptical flagmaker during the Revolutionary War in “The Flagmaker, 1775,” where she brings a decidedly more demure performance. In a production where characters are built and torn down within a matter of minutes, Reis-Dennis acquitted herself beautifully. 
 
Replete with tricky vocal jumps and sudden shifts in speed and volume dynamics, the score exhibited a wide range of emotions in the production, which the cast successfully executed with gusto. Although the entire cast was vocally on point, two talents were especially noteworthy: Joshuah B. Campbell ’16 and Amy K. Sparrow ’15. Campbell brings power to his performances in “On the Deck of a Spanish Sailing Ship, 1492” and “Flying Home” with his soulful voice, while Sparrow infused admirable singing with spirited acting in “Surabaya-Santa.” As Mrs. Claus complains about her marriage to dear old Saint Nick, Sparrow dexterously jumped from low to high notes with precision in seconds, showing her frustration in ways that go beyond words. In addition to tremendous solo vocals, the harmonies effortlessly accompanied the lead singer. There were times where the voices cracked under the strain of the high notes, but these instances did not detract from the strength of the overall singing.
 
Director Susanna B. Wolk ’14 complemented the actors and thematic elements of each song with thoughtful staging. Rather than containing the production in a small space, Wolk utilized the entire theater beyond the stage. This lent greater impact to certain songs and allowed for greater creativity in bringing each song to life. At the beginning of “On the Deck of a Spanish Sailing Ship, 1492,” Campbell stood on top of the stairs in the back of the theater, overlooking the audience and performers. As he pled to God, the image created was reminiscent of a preacher above a congregation, an apt parallel in a song about the search for mercy and a better world. Lighting by Chris Fournier also accentuated the shifting emotional currents. Bursts of red and oranges reflected sudden epiphanies or stronger emotions; muted blues represented the characters’ controlled feelings.
 
Nevertheless, the challenge of developing some cohesiveness from the music proved to be the production’s largest problem. The individual pieces were rich, but any thread weaving them together was not visibly apparent. Script-wise, every song dealt with a decision, be it the decision to jump off a building or to leave a loved one. Combined, they became a testament to people’s experiences across time and generations. Yet the execution generally lacked a continuity that would make the scenes feel as if they belonged in one show. An exception was the transition from “The Flagmaker, 1775” to “Flying Home”; as Campbell sung his opening verses, he draped the flag over a frozen Reis-Dennis. It was a moment of interaction from one scene to the next that seemed to elucidate a deeper meaning between the songs.
 
Regardless of its imperfections, “Songs for a New World” proved to be an entertaining journey through time and space. While song cycles may not have widespread appeal, the production is nevertheless an excellent example of how it should be done—with careful staging, orchestration, and an energetic and talented cast.

It’s “sun’s out, guns out” season for Harvard athletics, with the cruel throes of winter finally gone for good (hopefully). Sophomore pitcher Laura Riccardione took full advantage, tossing two beauties over the weekend to smite the Brown Bears squad in its stead. For her work, she takes top honors this week, but she was certainly not alone in fine Crimson performances.
Brian Yeung, Men’s Tennis
Yeung may be a freshman, but there was nothing “young” about his performances this weekend against Princeton and Penn. The Hong Kong native won all four of his weekend matches—two doubles and two singles—to push Harvard’s record to 3-1 in Ivy play. Bright the future is with this one.
Nick Madden, Men’s Volleyball
Repeating as AOTW runner-up, Madden had his eighth career double-double and fourth of the season, putting up a 17 kill, 10 dig game against NJIT Friday night.
Chris Gibbons, Men’s Volleyball
Not to be outdone by his fellow co-captain, Gibbons went off for 20 digs against Rutgers-Newark on Saturday afternoon. To put that in perspective, no one else had more than eight in the match.

UPDATED: April 18, 2014, at 2:27 a.m.
The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research announced Tuesday its 23 W. E. B. Du Bois fellows for the 2014-2015 academic year, a group that includes professors, students, artists, as well as a former Black Panther.
This year’s application cycle for the Du Bois fellowships drew the most applicants to date, said University Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the director of the Du Bois Institute and its parent organization, the Hutchins Center. He attributed the increase to the “generosity” of donor Glenn H. Hutchins ’77, who endowed both the center that bears his name and a number of new Du Bois fellowships.
“I think this is one of...the strongest group of fellows to come to the Du Bois Institute,” Gates said.
Fellowships with the Du Bois Institute last either the entire academic year or just one semester. During their time at the Hutchins Center, fellows pursue individual research projects that are related to African and African American studies.
A few fellows in this year’s class already teach and research at Harvard. Nevertheless, Maria Tatar, a professor of Germanic languages and literatures and chair of the folklore and mythology program, said that the fellowship opens new doors for research.
“I think it’s a great opportunity to recharge our intellectual batteries, and make sure that we don't fall into teaching the same old same old course,” she said. “It allows us to chart new directions and open up new research interests.”
As a fellow, Tatar will be working on a book with Gates about African American folklore.
Tatar said that the community created by the center is integral to the experience of being a Du Bois fellow.
“For me, it is absolutely essential to be in this community of scholars, many of whom have a deeper understanding of the discipline and can put me in touch with so many colleagues and resources at other institutions,” she said. “[The fellows and I] are so fortunate to have sabbaticals and to have an opportunity to soak in a topic and really be able to dig deeply and broaden our understanding of a topic.”
Funding from the Hutchins Center provides fellows with the time, money, and space they need to conduct their work. Fellows can receive up to $50,000 in funding, according to Gates.
Northwestern University history professor and newly announced fellow Kate Masur said that the basic support from the Hutchins Center is important, saying that the fellowship offers “time and...a space to work on [my] project.”
Since it was formed in September, the Hutchins Center has served as the umbrella organization for about a dozen programs in the field of African and African American studies at Harvard, including the Hiphop Archive and Research Institute. The move financially united these initiatives with a $15 million gift from Hutchins, a co-chair of the Harvard Campaign and one of the University’s most high-profile donors.

Every year, Glamour Magazine honors a group of women ranging from future astronauts to fencers on its list of Top Ten College Women. This year, Harvard’s very own Inesha N. Premaratne ’15 and Ishani D. Premaratne ’15 (that’s right, both of them) were recipients of the award. Aside from their obvious genetic inclination to success, the two were recognized for their project “GrowLanka,” an SMS system that alerts unemployed workers in Sri Lanka about job openings. Inspiration for the idea came out of a class the two were taking during their freshman fall, which had students deconstruct a social issue and explore different ways to solve those problems.
The following January term, Ishani and Inesha both visited Sri Lanka and went straight to work, conducting ground research by interviewing people. “Both of us grew up with one foot in the United States and foot in Sri Lanka,” Ishani said. “We toured a lot of the factories that had just opened, we talked to a lot of NGO people, we talked to anybody we could and consistently the major thing we found in the labor market itself were these search frictions,” Inesha said.
Following the civil war in Sri Lanka, which ended in 2009, there was a major shortage in human capital networks. “We decided to leverage the incredibly high mobile penetration and created a really simple SMS system… [It] was unique because there’s not a system there that only leverages SMS.” With the help of Harvard funding, they worked with Sewalanka, one of Sri Lanka’s chief NGOs, to bring the idea to life. The pair have since been able to keep their project alive, even partnering with the Sri Lankan government.
Speaking of the Glamour honor, they said it was definitely a surprise. Inesha said that “It was nice because they made a point to give it to the two of us but also to honor us separately, which is really important to me.” As twins, they’re used to the competition but said that they were never really competitive with each other. “We’re very different, and our roommates would tell you that us staying in the same room for too long is probably not a good thing,” Ishani said. “We complemented each other.” What would have happened if only one of them had won? “It would have been super awks.”
As one of Glamour’s Top Ten College Women, and definitely a woman to admire, Ishani’s advice to Harvard women is “not lose that curiosity and thirst to learn more about your fellow Harvard women.”
“Enjoy the many different seasons the Harvard education gives you,” Inesha said. “I think there’s a hesitancy to take a risk at Harvard—go off the beaten path and try new things. Take risks when you’re in college. Go listen to people for a month and they will tell you what they want. Go outside of your sphere of reference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
I’ve never really understood the celebration of birthdays. As a little kid with a (perhaps unhealthy) fascination with military history, I was grateful for the excuse to play laser tag. And parties were fun—bad pizza is still better than 90 percent of meals, and who doesn’t like Fudgie the Whale?
From a young age, though, the practice of gift giving confused me. I used to watch “The Lion King” about once a week, and Timon was always saying things like “Let me get this straight. You know her. She knows you. But she wants to eat him. And everyone’s okay with this?”
So I said to my sister: “Let me get this straight. Chris buys me a Breyer horse even though he has no way of knowing that I already have Secretariat, and I buy him Pokémon cards even though I don’t know Mewtwo from Dragonite?”
“Yes.”
“That’s silly.” 
“A little. It’s the thought that counts.”
“If it’s the thought that counts, why do people have to buy stuff?”
“They just do. And if they get you sand art, don’t invite them next year.”  
I don’t understand the attention, either. “Congratulations!” say my relatives. I never know if this is a foreign thing, or if they’re actually congratulating me on not having died. “I can’t believe how old you’ve gotten!” Really, second cousin once removed? That’s how time works. We live in a chaotic and mysterious universe, but the orbit of the earth around the sun is very predictable. 
Three days ago, I turned 21. I would throw in some tropes about milestones and the passage of time and coming of age and all that, but those are thoughts you’ve thunk and themes you wrote papers on in high school English class. I’m now of drinking age (if not of drinking disposition)—old enough to wonder what I did to deserve such a flat, flavorless Manhattan. I can cross the street without holding my mom’s hand, drive a car, and lose money in a casino. And I’m divisible by seven, which I guess is pretty cool. 
Historical birthday nonchalance aside, I’d been feeling a little weird about the whole 21 thing for a while. Last week, I called my parents. 
“Let me get this straight. I’m supposed to be a grown up for the rest of my life?”
“Yes,” answered my mom. “But remember—while youth is fleeting, immaturity is forever. I’m 56 and I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up!”
“Then how am I supposed to figure it out?”
“Little one,” said my dad. “No one does. You’ll be okay—just remember the three rules of civilization.”
How could I forget? First, commit not that gravest of sins—you must always replace the toilet paper roll behind you when you’ve finished one. Second, when you’re eating party mix, you must eat whatever your hand falls on. No picking out the Cheetos and leaving the pretzels. And third, when there’s prime rib on the menu, get it. 
But where do we find purpose and meaning? What if we don’t like consulting? In his graduation address to Stanford’s class of 2005, Steve Jobs advised, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.” I quite like Dots, especially the red ones, but Jobs doesn’t offer us much in the way of strategy. 
The best piece of advice I’ve come across is Judith Shapiro’s: “You want the inside of your head to be an interesting place to spend the rest of your life.” If it is, life is an adventure—the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are plot points, not tragedies. If you’re a human, they’re an opportunity to build and discover character. If you’re a friend, they’re an opportunity to get closer to those who are friends to you. And if you’re a writer, they’re material. 
Twenty-one, for me, doesn’t mean much; but sitting here on the cusp of adulthood, I can’t help but be apprehensive. Free will may be an illusion, but it’s as real to me as anything, and I intend to get my money’s worth. 
So—what to do with my 21-year-old self? I honestly don’t know. I can’t get myself the thing I always wanted growing up, at least until Harvard approves species-neutral housing. The thing I secretly hoped for, even though my apartment building didn’t allow them; the thing I didn’t dare ask for because it seemed to make my parents sad. 
But I know what I’ll do for my 22nd birthday. When I’m a senior, and spring is in the air and nostalgia in the Kool-Aid, I’ll be headed to the pound to find a puppy to spoil rotten.
Happy birthday, little one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a stifling late-June morning, Ruth Watterson sat frustrated in front of her television, its sole channel playing on repeat the footage of Patriots player Aaron Hernandez’s arrest for first-degree murder. She took out her laptop, opened up Internet tabs for multiple news sites, and “refreshed, refreshed, refreshed.” After her umpteenth click of the reload button, a new item finally appeared at the top of the page: the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Windsor to strike down part of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. Upon reading through the article, Ruth let out a literal sigh of relief before calling Kristin, her partner of four years, to share the news.
For Ruth, the decision was monumental. A few months ago, on Valentine’s Day, she had proposed to Kristin. The Court’s verdict opened a door to American citizenship, one that had been firmly closed before: she and her fiancée could now start a family in the States.
“I’ve never had a law affect my life so much,” she notes. “When it fell, I thought I would be overjoyed, but I was really more relieved than anything—to know that my family could stay together.”
That fall, when the couple went to meet Ruth’s immigration lawyer after their marriage, they learned that the extension of federal benefits to same-sex marriages would transform Ruth’s case from a near impossibility to a fairly standard bureaucratic formality. After providing the attorney with a more than 3-inch-thick binder of photos and documentation attesting to the authenticity of their marriage (“the most she had ever seen”), a green card arrived in their Quincy mailbox by springtime—a first step, Ruth hopes, to naturalization.
A decade earlier and before she met Kristin, though, Ruth had a very different vision of her future. Born in Northern Ireland to working-class parents, she was the first (and so far only) person in her family to attend college. At the University of St Andrews, where she pursued degrees in English, Medieval History, and Modern History, Ruth thought that she would teach secondary school students after graduating. But upon the advice of her Harvard-educated professor for a class entitled “Good Wives, Base Seducers, and Colonial Cross-Dressers,” she decided to turn her attention towards graduate studies in American history.
Now a ninth-year candidate in Harvard’s history PhD program, Ruth recalls the difficulties she encountered when first adjusting to life in America. Passing through customs on her first visit to the country was, in her sleep-deprived state, an anxiety-provoking experience. Filing visa paperwork, answering the immigration officer’s grilling questions, and even tipping her taxi driver upon arrival at Harvard Square all proved discomforting experiences.
“It was all very ‘grown up’ at a time when I still felt like a kid. Even when I went to pay my driver, I worried that I wasn’t tipping high enough and so handed out all of my American bills for him to pick out what he felt he was owed.”
At Harvard, she found herself among many internationals, but did not find a community of British peers to join.  Given the close cultural ties between America and the United Kingdom—shared music, literature, and language—Ruth found herself assimilating quickly, even losing some of her already-slight Irish accent.
During her first year in the States, she threw a St. Patrick’s Day party, hoping to share some of her upbringing with her friends (though she had never celebrated the holiday back home). Having prepared an entire spread of traditional Irish foods, she was surprised to discover that her friends had a much different expectation for the holiday fare: green Guinness and green mashed potatoes. “The next year, I just got green cupcakes and green beer, and dyed everything green—it was so much easier,” she jokes.
But a certain fear lurked beneath the kitsch. Because Ruth has assimilated so well and been accepted so fully as an American, she worries about losing her cultural heritage. Some of her friends still express disbelief at her Northern Irish background, and she sometimes wishes that she had a stronger accent to assert her identity. When she and Kristin have children in the years ahead, she wants them to know both halves of their culture, to be proud of their heritage and to know that they are part British: “I want to sing Irish lullabies to them and take them back to see where I come from.”
Despite her concerns about the pitfalls of assimilation, Ruth is excited to begin the naturalization process once the three-year waiting period for people who have acquired a green card through marriage ends. She and Kristin will soon look for work at universities located in states that recognize same-sex unions, to ensure their spousal and parental rights.
“Obviously, there are a lot of challenges in coming to the U.S. and being a foreigner. But I’m really lucky. I came here because I love American history, but I’ve grown to love American culture too—I find it really weird to go back. Everything’s been worth it. I’ve got a great education and, now, I’ve got a family.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This Monday, the Undergraduate Council voted to demand that Harvard administrators to cover summer storage fees for all students, regardless of House. Currently, Houses that have undergone renovations (such as Quincy House) will no longer provide free storage options in-House during the summer, as storage space has made way for student lounges and conference rooms. Leverett will also stop offering free storage starting in 2015 as McKinlock Hall finishes its current renovations. The College should recognize the financial difficulties faced by college students and do all it can to minimize these costs for students, rather than increase them.
 
While we acknowledge that Harvard has taken some steps to alleviate the financial costs for students, there are several significant drawbacks. Although Quincy will be providing additional furniture in rooms, including tables, chairs and sofas in an attempt to reduce the number of large items that require storing over the summer, this new arrangement makes no accommodation for students who have already invested in furniture and will lose the place to store it. Additionally, it limits the student’s ability to personalize their living space—their home-away-from-home on campus. Harvard has also decided to offer students a slight discount for storage through the company Collegeboxes. A standard “Collegebox,” which measures in at 24-by-18-by-16 inches, costs $45 without the discount. Considering the amount of bulky winter gear that most students at Harvard require during the school year, it is easy to see how the price of storage through Collegeboxes can quickly become burdensome for many students. A Quincy student estimated that the cost per student could be at least $150 dollars.
Given that the housing lottery is intended to make the upperclassmen living experience fair for all, the new stance the College is taking on summer storage undercuts the lottery’s purpose. Expecting solely the residents of Quincy and Leverett to pay out-of-pocket for storage expenses is simply not egalitarian. Although the administration may argue that they are simply in the process of phasing out summer storage, they should not discount the experiences of students who have to live through this transitional stage. In the interest of equity among students, Harvard should either provide free storage to all students or to none.
 
As UC president Gus Mayopoulos pointed out, given that President Drew Faust rejected the UC's earlier proposal for increased student activity funding on the grounds that she did not want to increase costs for students, this move on the part of the College seems inconsistent. The University should either make arrangements for greater financial aid for storage purposes or make accommodations for free storage to continue.

“Just found out that I’ll be spending the summer in Istanbul!”
 
“Headed to Barcelona this summer!”
 
“Bye-bye US, and hello France! Accepted into a summer program today!”
 
So begins many a recent Facebook status, reflecting (appropriately) the excitement of those lucky few given spots in study abroad programs for the summer. Understandably, these animated posts garner almost unparalleled support from the online community, sending them to the top of friends’ newsfeeds for their viewing pleasure. Fittingly, the happy cycle of “liking” and “commenting” continues without hindrance, until, of course, the post reaches someone less enthused by the vocalized success.
 
Invariably, acceptances come tandem with rejections—often, even, the balance tips in favor of the latter. This fact is one that we, especially, should be keenly aware of. All’s well and good with a post about a memorable summer to come, but it’s certainly read differently by someone denied the same opportunity. Delight for a friend is sometimes, sadly, overcome by a sense of failure. But why that feeling of underachievement?
 
The issue, in the context of our summers, reaches far deeper than a mere tension between acceptance and rejection. By publishing acceptances so prominently on social media, we perpetuate the myth that the only route to a successful summer is through an expensive, intensive program in a foreign country. It would seem that the notion of having “just a summer job, at home” has been stigmatized to the point of irreconcilable inferiority, lacking in all respects to an internship or slate of classes, domestic or international.
 
This is neither the case nor an acceptable course to maintain.
 
An email from the Office of Career Services last week sported the heading “Summer: It’s Not Too Late to Plan.” It is a point that even I, apparent denouncer of all things experiential and fun, agree with wholeheartedly. I’ve watched my friends, roommates, and self struggle to find and organize the “perfect” summer, one that invariably includes weeks (if not months) of exhaustive activity, all while feeling the pressures of those warm months fast approaching. When we plan ahead, we relieve the stress of uncertainty. If those plans spare us no moment of rest, though, are we really doing our future selves a favor?
 
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 noted the value of a simple summer in an address during Freshman Parents’ Weekend, explaining that time at home for a few months might in fact be time best spent. On campus, literature detailing the benefits of rest and relaxation is prolific—why shouldn’t the same logic apply to our lives away from the yard? The idea that a heavily programmed summer is stimulating, intellectually and otherwise, is well-founded in truth, but the widely internalized view that a looser one is not is simply false.
 
Here, reminders that we should be “finding our passion” and “carpe diem-ing” come almost ad nauseam and serve not to inspire, but to discourage. When students see or hear an achievement voiced, they might easily make a mental leap to inferiority should their plans not be of similar extravagance. It’s no shortcoming of theirs to feel disappointed; it’s not that they can’t share in their friends’ joy, which they most certainly can, and do. Rather, it’s a factor of the above described myth, that one’s drive for achievement, for a better-rounded self, for a fulfilling life to come, is somehow compromised if they momentarily “stop driving.”
 
Through social media, many of us broadcast—intentionally or not—that a summer spent at home is nothing more than an undesirable pit stop, a void that will undoubtedly prove to undermine our intellectual intentions. This description might seem extreme, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable. Nine to five has been replaced by June to July, 24/7. Weekend trips with old friends have been overshadowed by summer-long expeditions to make new ones. Not to suggest that this is somehow wrong, or worse—who wouldn’t go to Paris if they had the chance? But time to recoup at home, though less glamorous, is invaluable.
 
Often, our minds lead us to the conclusion that, having been exposed to the real world at college, we’ll be bored to distraction at home, a place lacking in culture, stimuli, and opportunities to grow. To quote the old adage, “The grass always seems greener on the other side.” But making something out of a supposed nothing and filling a summer with experiences generated solely from one’s own impetus and hard-earned funds is a skill as practical as any. We usually find that we can’t, in fact, do all that we set out to, even with months of time. Those familiar with Bill Watterson can certainly understand my sentiment: I’ll be spending my summer at home with Hobbes, thinking, “The days are just packed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers announced Monday that employees at Dumbarton Oaks, a Harvard research library and museum in Washington, D.C., are eligible to join the union.
About 45 staff members at Dumbarton Oaks, who are considered Harvard employees, made the decision to be part of HUCTW on April 1 by a vote of 62 percent with a 90 percent turnout. Given this majority vote in favor of joining the union, the University agreed to recognize Dumbarton Oaks employees as members of HUCTW.
 
Nearly a year ago, several Dumbarton Oaks employees approached HUCTW, but the union’s bargaining unit did not include workers outside of Massachusetts. To incorporate the D.C. employees, HUCTW and the University negotiated with a neutral arbitrator and opted to allow Dumbarton Oaks workers to unionize if they received majority support. 
HUCTW leaders and Harvard administrators cooperatively developed the voting process, and a secret ballot election was administered by the American Arbitration Association on the Georgetown University campus. HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said the process proceeded “quickly” and “smoothly.”
“It’s a good moment for our efforts at being collaborative with union management relationships,” Jaeger said.
Harvard’s Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy also said he was pleased with the cooperation between the University and HUCTW.
“Harvard values it's relationship with HUCTW and looks forward to a mutually beneficial relationship,” Murphy wrote in an email.
Staff members at Dumbarton Oaks, a research center focusing on Byzantine, Garden and Landscape, and Pre-Columbian studies, hold jobs similar to their Massachusetts counterparts, including researchers, financial and library assistants, coordinators, gardeners, and museum attendants. However, without the ability to join the union, some discrepancies existed between Dumbarton Oaks employees and HUCTW members.
“It appears that their rates of pay are a bit lower than for comparable jobs [in Massachusetts],” Jaeger said. “They haven’t had access to our child care or financial systems program, and they haven’t had access to some of our housing assistance programs or our improved educational benefits.”
Several employees at Dumbarton Oaks expressed excitement about the opportunity to join the union.
“Dumbarton Oaks is such a unique and incredible place to work, and I just think it can only get better with the union,” said Melissa Brizer, a greenhouse specialist at Dumbarton Oaks who joined HUCTW.
Jaeger agreed that many Dumbarton Oaks workers were enthusiastic about becoming more integrated with the rest of the Harvard community.
“For the people down there, more important than any of the economic benefits is the idea of having an equal voice and having the opportunity to participate in a respectful way in the workplace,” Jaeger said.
Although a number of employees voted against unionizing, Brizer said she thinks many will ultimately join HUCTW.
“We did get the majority, but I think there [are] always people who are hesitant for change and not exactly sure what the union is all about,” Brizer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At an open forum sponsored by the Undergraduate Council Thursday, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard has submitted a revised sexual assault policy, updated to align with recent changes to federal Title IX regulations, to the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education.
If approved, the policy would mark the first time all schools within the University would be required to comply with the same set of regulations regarding sexual assault.
In addition to detailing the legal, educational, and preventive components of the University’s approach to sexual assault and misconduct on campus, Faust fielded questions on a range of issues in the forum. including student organization funding and race relations.More than 60 college students and Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister attended the event.
The updated sexual assault policy is the product of a working group convened in May 2013 to evaluate both school-specific and University-wide policies to ensure that Harvard’s practices conform to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sexual harassment and broader gender-based discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding.
Faust's announcement about the updated policy comes after an op-ed published by The Crimson earlier this month sparked campus-wide conversation on the issue of sexual assault and Faust announced the creation of a task force focused on community awareness and prevention.
“We needed to really look hard at preventing this in the first place, and that is the responsibility of the entire Harvard community,” Faust said at the forum.
Throughout the question-and-answer period, Faust responded to a series of questions from students, many of whom belonged to student organizations that have recently demanded changes to College and University policy. Though students said they appreciated the opportunity to speak directly to the University president, some characterized her responses as vague and, at times, evasive.
In the question that prompted Faust to explain the University’s approach to sexual assault issues, Jessica R. Fournier '17, a co-organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group devoted to reforming Harvard’s sexual assault policies, asked why undergraduates were not on the University working group on the issue that was convened last year.
Faust responded by explaining that the previous year’s working group was focused on the legal issues of sexual assault, while the recently announced task force, which includes two undergraduate students, addresses community issues of education, prevention, and support.
Still, Emily M. Fox-Penner '17, another organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better, said that she had hoped to hear a “more concrete strategy” to involve a wide range of student voices on the issue.
On the topic of campus community, Kimiko M. Matsuda-Lawrence ’16, writer and director of the play, “I, Too, Am Harvard,” which propelled a campus-wide conversation on inclusion and identity in March, asked about the concrete changes expected from the working group announced by Pfister and his incoming successor Rakesh Khurana earlier this month.
Faust said that she predicted that the group may explore how to approach conversations during freshman orientation and the ways of building community to support diversity, such as through a multicultural center.
After the forum, Matsudo-Lawrence said she is still waiting on further details on the working group.
“We’re all just waiting to hear what the working group will be, what shape it will take, what it will actually be producing,” Matsudo-Lawrence said.
Touching on another hot-button campus issue, Leah C. Singer '16, chair of the UC Finance Committee, asked Faust the UC’s funding issues and its efforts, unsuccessful so far, to increase its annual budget. Faust referred the question to Pfister, who expressed support for UC funding efforts, but emphasized that Harvard continues to face budgetary constraints and the lack of flexibility in shifting money to student groups.
Singer said after the forum that she understood their answers, but expressed frustration that “nothing new was presented on the conversation.”
Harvard’s endowment also came up in the question-and-answer session. Blake McGhghy ’17, a member of the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, asked Faust if she believed the practices at Harvard-owned Argentinian plantations aligned with the University’s values.
Faust then called on McGhgy and others to read an op-ed published Wednesday by Andrew G. Wiltshire, head of alternative assets for the Harvard Management Company, which she said detailed “misstatements” that Responsible Investment at Harvard has propagated. Faust implored members to “look at those facts” and recognize that “any debate about responsible investment must begin with the facts.”
In addition, Faust faced questions regarding the loss of summer storage space in undergraduate Houses undergoing renewal and the absence of Latino studies programs on campus, among other topics.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 described administrators’ responses as constructive and honest, but acknowledged that “the student advocates were definitely looking for more in [Faust’s] answers.”
Mayopoulos said that although various administrators have listened to the Council’s concerns, communication could be improved.
“It would be nice for us to have partners in the administration who worked with us to make these changes happen instead of denying us the changes that students want,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going into Wednesday, the Harvard and Princeton baseball teams had been waiting eagerly for 18 days to get a chance to face off in a full game.
The teams were originally scheduled to play each other on March 29 on the Tigers’ Clarke Field, but inclement weather halted action after four full innings of play.
After resuming the postponed doubleheader, the Crimson (9-21, 4-8 Ivy) took the first game against the Tigers (10-20, 5-7) in a close 4-3 contest, but would fall in the second match, 6-2.
PRINCETON 6, HARVARD 2
After winning the day’s first contest, Harvard hoped to go two-for-two against conference rival Princeton.
“We were excited after the first win,” junior co-captain Ethan Ferreira said. “But after about five minutes…we were hungry to get the next one, because we know how important these games are.”
The Crimson’s momentum from that win rolled over into the second matchup. Harvard wasted no time jumping out to a two-run lead in the top of the first inning.Those runs came off a two-out double by Ferreira, scoring co-captain second baseman Kyle Larrow and junior right fielder Brandon Kregel.
This early offensive production would quickly be stymied by the Tigers’ stingy pitching. Luke Strieber and Nick Donatiello manned the mound for Princeton and combined for eight strikeouts to hold the Harvard batters in check the rest of the way.
But solid defense from the Crimson would maintain Harvard’s advantage throughout most of the game. Sophomore righty Nick Scahill and freshman lefty Greg Coman took care of the early innings. The duo allowed only one run to the Tigers to keep the Crimson’s lead at 2-1 going into the eighth.
“The first seven innings were all about pitching,” said junior center fielder Mike Martin. “[Princeton] didn’t come close to scoring a run.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, the defensive flood gates were about to break down. In the eighth inning, the Tigers’ offense finally hit its stride and pounded the ball around the field. Princeton strung together six hits, took advantage of wild pitches and walks, and ultimately put five runners across the plate, leaving the Crimson down 6-2 heading into the ninth inning.
Donatiello’s pitching for the Tigers would be enough to preserve the lead, and Harvard was held silent in the ninth, ultimately falling to Princeton, 6-2.
“We just kind of cooled down,” Ferreira said. “We didn’t execute as well as we could have or should have.”
HARVARD 4, PRINCETON 3
It was déjà vu for the Crimson as it stepped off the bus in New Jersey to continue where it left off last time out against the Tigers, in the top of the fifth inning with a 1-1 tie.
“The funny thing about that is…[we started] the same pitchers that were pitching when the rain came,” Martin said. “We really picked up right where we left off.”
The game was scheduled as a seven-inning matchup, leaving only three innings of regulation left to play.
The teams would exchange blows in the sixth and seventh innings. The Crimson got the first word when senior designated hitter Carlton Bailey roped a double into the left field gap and found himself in scoring position with no outs.
After Larrow moved Bailey to third base with a sacrifice bunt, Martin finished the job by driving him home on a base-hit single.
“We came in facing one of the better Ivy League pitchers,” Martin said. “I was lucky enough that he gave me a fastball that I kept my hands inside and hit right back up the middle.”
Martin did not stop there, as he used his legs to steal two bases in a row and put himself on third base with one out. He would then tag up on a foul-ball out by Ferreira, crossing the plate and putting Harvard ahead, 3-1.
But Princeton fired back in the seventh inning when Alec Keller struck for two RBIs on a homer. The blast left each team with three runs and sent the game into extra innings.
In this back-and-forth match, it would be the Crimson that got the last word. In the top of the ninth, junior left fielder Jack Colton worked his way around the bases after slapping a single to left. He eventually scored the go-ahead run on a fielding error with Princeton's Chris Bodurian in his second inning of work.
The Tigers were then shut down the rest of the way by Harvard senior right-hander Sam Dodge to cement a 4-3 victory for the Crimson in extra innings.
“Our bats came alive in the [five] innings that we played,” Ferreira said. “The game was definitely a little strange, but I think we responded very well as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore midfielder Audrey Todd scored a career-high four goals, including three in the second half, to lead the Harvard women’s lacrosse team past Boston University on a brisk Wednesday night at Harvard Stadium.
The Crimson (8-5, 3-2 Ivy) defeated the Terriers (6-9, 4-3 Patriot), 11-6, in its last nonconference game of the season. The victory gives Harvard a 13-11 advantage in the all-time series with its crosstown rival and exacts revenge for a 12-11 loss at BU last year.
In the second half of the season, Todd has emerged as one of the most potent threats for the balanced Crimson offense.
In the squad’s last five games, Todd has totaled 15 goals and produced four hat tricks. She added two assists against BU to give her six total points in the contest, also a career-high, and 29 for the year.
“[Todd] plays beyond her years,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “She’s composed and steady and smart, and easy to play with.”
Free position shots proved vital to Harvard’s offensive success, as the team converted five of the nine that were attempted. Three of Todd’s markers came off free position opportunities, with sophomore Alexis Nicolia and freshman Marisa Romeo each adding free position scores of her own to allow Harvard to take advantage of the physicality of the game.
Romeo continued her dominant play this season, tallying three scores to increase her Ivy League-leading total to 42 total goals. The mark also puts Romeo at the top of the team’s leaderboard in scoring.
Other than an early 1-1 tie, the Crimson led for the entire contest. As it has in most of its recent games, Harvard raced out to an early lead, finding the net three times in a row to lead the Terriers, 4-1, in the first half.
“We’re looking to our last two games, which are both Ivy [League matchups], so we know how important it is to have a fast start all the time,” co-captain Kyleigh Keating said. “I think we also had some fire under our butts from the last game, and we wanted to come out fast.”
In its last contest, the Crimson fell, 15-6, to Princeton on Saturday at Harvard Stadium. The Tigers now sit atop the Ivy League standings after a 9-5 victory over Penn, which was previously unbeaten in conference play and handed the Crimson its only other league loss this season.
Despite the early deficit, BU battled back, outscoring Harvard 3-2 over the final 12 minutes of the opening frame to cut the halftime deficit to two.
But in the second half, the Crimson locked down defensively, holding the visitors to one goal through the first 26 minutes of the final 30 and building a five-goal lead to essentially seal the victory.
Although the triumph guarantees a winning record for Harvard this season, the Crimson must prevail in at least one of its two remaining games to earn a berth into the four-team Ancient Eight tournament.
Harvard currently sits in a tie with Cornell for third place in the league heading into its matchups with Columbia and Dartmouth. The good news for the Crimson is that both of those teams currently occupy the bottom two spots on the conference table.
According to Miller, the key for her team in the final games of the season will be handling pressure.
“We’re young, it shows up at different times, so I think composure [is a potential issue],” Miller said. “I think sometimes we’re surprised by how aggressive the other teams can be, and I think that’s just a transition from a high school game to a college game.”
Sophomore goalie Kelly Weis made seven saves to anchor the Harvard defense against the Terriers. Weis has been a mainstay in the net for the Crimson, starting every game this season. Her play has served as a barometer for Harvard all season long, as she has given up over six scores per game in wins but almost 14 in each of the team’s losses.
Junior Sophia Capone added two goals for the Crimson, while freshman Megan Hennessey notched one of her own as one of the five players to combine for Harvard’s first five points.
“All year long we’ve been trying to spread the ball around and make sure that everybody on the field is a threat,” Miller said. “I just think it’s too easy to defend when you only have two or three weapons…. We have good players and we want them all to assert themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This is the fourth article in an occasional semester-long series on homelessness in Harvard Square. Read earlier installments here, here, and here.
Wrapped in a gray blanket on a rainy Friday afternoon in early April, Jade Hosie, 22, panhandles outside of a Harvard Square CVS on Garden St. Hosie ended up homeless almost two years ago when she and her mother lost their house in Buffalo, N.Y. after her mother fell ill.
Two days later, Harley, 19, is occupying the same space outside of CVS. A self-described “gypsy,” she says that Cambridge is just the latest stop on her two-year journey from Philadelphia up the Eastern seaboard.
A week later, as the weather starts warming up, Mike Olson, a San Francisco native who finds himself on the streets in Cambridge; Max, a homeless youth who is struggling to obtain treatment for a neurological disorder; and Alex Sanchez, who lives with her boyfriend in Cambridge but who enjoys the company in the Square, are smoking in the Pit.
These five stories suggest both the variety of life experiences of the homeless youth population that lives in and around Harvard Square and the challenges facing those who hope to aid this often overlooked subgroup within the larger homeless population.
As Dr. Ralph Vetters ’85 of the Sidney Borum Jr. Health Center points out, no matter how these young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 lose their homes, they are more likely than adults to become victims of sexual or other physical violence when out on the streets, while also facing many of the same basic challenges of homeless life.
But those who work with homeless youths say that despite their vulnerability, this group has the best chance of avoiding chronic homelessness and, as such, deserves greater attention and investment of resources than has previously been offered.
THE THREAT OF ASSAULT
In addition to the problems of exposure and hunger that all of Harvard Square’s homeless face on a daily basis, young people entering the streets face an added risk—they are often preyed upon by adults seeking money or sex.
As a single woman on the streets, Hosie says that several men have tried to take advantage of her situation, soliciting her for prostitution. “They know you’re desperate,” she says, adding that she has been able to fend them off.
“I’m not really afraid of anything,” she says. “As long as I’m not in a vulnerable situation like sleeping or something, I’m pretty good.”
Still, she recalls a time when she was almost raped while sleeping in the Harvard Square T stop. “I woke up with a guy in my sleeping bag next to me. He tried to kiss me. He tried to get on top of me, and I pushed him off. I grabbed my stuff and ran away,” she recounts.
Hosie’s experience is not unique. According to the 2013 Street Outreach Data Collection Report, a federally-funded study on homeless and runaway young people, about 17 percent of Boston-area homeless youth have been sexually assaulted or raped at some point. It is estimated that another 29.8 percent have suffered physical violence.
Hosie says she has experienced less harassment since she started panhandling with her fiance, who is also homeless.
According to Vetters, this is not unusual. Forming connections with other homeless youth, he says, is a matter of not just companionship but also protection. He describes the tendency of homeless youth to live in “street families,” small groups whose members look out for one another.
Even though there can be incidents of violence within certain street families, Vetters says, youth generally prefer living in groups rather than facing the dangers of living on their own.
The “street fam” community, Olson says, is something he values and wants to hold together.
“I don’t want to be alone,” he adds, as he sits with friends under the Out of Town News stand to take shelter from the rain.
BETWEEN RESIDENTS AND TRAVELERS
Unlike her other friends in the Square, Harley is only here temporarily.
“I’m not homeless,” she says. “I’m a gypsy—a nomad.”
Harley, who declined to give her last name, says her mother kicked her out of their Philadelphia home three years ago, and she—then 16—made her way to New York City. There, she says she met a group of travelers and eventually became their leader.
“In New York...they called me the ‘Gypsy Queen,’” she says, “because I ran with a band of gypsies that were all older than me, and I had their respect.”
Cambridge’s youth homeless population can largely be divided into two groups: the resident homeless and the travelers. The resident homeless are primarily youths who have been forced out of steady shelter due to poverty or family disputes, whereas the travelers generally have chosen the lifestyle of wandering from city to city and living on the streets.
For both of these populations, Vetters says, substance abuse is an issue, with marijuana and alcohol abuse prevalent among resident homeless and heroin abuse more common among travelers.
Both groups also have higher rates of mental illness than the general population, he adds, and some psychological trauma stems from experiences with discrimination based on sexual orientation. Nationally, about 30 percent of homeless youth identify as LBGTQ, he says.
Meeting these medical needs can be difficult, Vetters says, because there is often a mutual misunderstanding between healthcare providers and the homeless youth they serve. The dangers of life on the street, he says, leave these young adults distrustful of new people—a baseline reaction that creates tension when youth interact with medical personnel in emergency care facilities.
“They’re not cosseted little kids who will say ‘Thank you, sir’ and appreciate everything that’s done for them in a simple way,” Vetters says. “They’ve had to fight for everything all the time and so their initial reaction is defensive, aggressive.”
ACTING AS PSEUDO PARENTS
In order to overcome these initial defensive reactions of homeless youth, service providers need to prove that they are a trustworthy and constant presence, says Elisabeth Ortiz Jackson, the executive director of Bridge Over Troubled Water--currently the only youth homeless shelter in the Boston area.
“I tell my staff, ‘If you tell a kid that you’re going to have a coat for them, hell freezes freaking over, you better get them a coat,’” she says. “Don’t tell a kid that you’re going to do something if you’re not.”
Jackson’s organization provides a comprehensive set of services for homeless young adults, including an emergency shelter, career and college counseling, a transitional housing program, and a daytime drop-in center that provides hot meals.
She says that Bridge over Troubled Water specifically targets youth because they are more likely to work their way out of homelessness than older peers. “They’re young,” she says. “They’re willing to learn. They want to learn.”
Sintayuh Atkins, 19, is one of the guests with a six-month bed in Bridge’s shelter. In addition to a warm place to stay and hot meals, Atkins receives counseling, case management, and college guidance at the site. The shelter requires guests like Atkins to have a job or take classes, as well as save 70 percent of their income.
Atkins left the Bridge program soon after starting it in Jan. 2013, only to return a few months later after a difficult time on his own.
“When we talk about the kids who go up and down...we are still here for them,” Jackson says. “We become their pseudo parents.”
For all the work that Bridge has done, there remains a shortage of services for homeless youth in the Boston area, those who work with the group say. Youth on Fire, one of the few daytime drop-in centers for young adults on the street, will downsize and relocate in June to Central Square due to funding shortages.
“This isn’t the be-all, end-all,” said Steve Keizer, Coordinator of the Emergency Youth Shelter at Bridge.  “There’s a lot we can be doing with more beds.”
Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14 aim to provide some of those beds. The pair is working to establish a new youth homeless shelter in Harvard Square whose services will be combined with those of Youth on Fire.
For Greenberg and Rosenkrantz, the issue of youth homelessness is particularly salient because they are “youth serving youth.”
Rosenkrantz said she feels particularly called to action by seeing homeless youth her own age in the Square. “That reality, that tangible connection to the problem, is what’s emotionally driving me,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 17, 2013, at 7:45 p.m.
InstaNomz, a student-run food delivery service that launched at the beginning of March, has ceased operations indefinitely due to what it called an irresolvable conflict with the Harvard administration, the enterprise announced on its Facebook page Tuesday. 
The founders of the start-up, which delivered food from several popular restaurants in Harvard Square to the rooms of first-year students living in Elm and Ivy Yard dormitories, said that they were told that their service violated the school’s policies for student business activity on campus.
“The Office of Student Life informed us that we either had to operate as an outside vendor, which we understood as stopping outside of the dorm or House, or through Harvard Student Agencies,” wrote Akshar Bonu ’17 and Fanele S. Mashwama ’17, who developed the business out of a final project for the introductory computer science course CS50, in an emailed statement.
The Office of Student Life declined to comment on the record with regard to the admonition.
Bonu and Mashwama said, however, that they were unable to come to mutually agreeable terms with Harvard Student Agencies, a student-run not-for-profit organization that provides a range of services to the Harvard community. 
HSA President Ryley R. Reynolds ’15 declined to provide details of the negotiations.
The two founders voiced concern that refraining to enter a dormitory to deliver a meal as an outside vendor would incur greater time costs to their business—as a result, they decided to stop deliveries.
Although “Harvard permits undergraduates to undertake modest levels of business activities on campus,” according to the Harvard College Handbook for Students, the school’s policy reserves Harvard the right “to restrict or control student business use of its resources, facilities, academic product, copyrighted materials, and institutional data.”
While Bonu and Mashwama said that they were not explicitly told which policy they had violated, the Handbook cites “excessive foot traffic or movement of goods into or out of University Buildings” as an action that could warrant the prohibition of a student business by the College.
In 2004, neverthless, a now-defunct enterprise similar to InstaNomz called Crimsonfood.com gained authorization from the dean of the College’s office to deliver food directly to the dorm rooms of students living in the Radcliffe Quadrangle.
While they will no longer deliver to Harvard students, Bonu and Mashwama said they are looking to expand InstaNomz to serve other local academic institutions.
“Moving forward,” they said, “we are looking to launch InstaNomz in other Boston and Cambridge universities, but still hold onto the hope that we can launch it where we want to see it most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Key players involved in organizing the law enforcement response to last year’s bombing at the Boston Marathon discussed their strategy during the incident and its implications for security at this year’s marathon during a panel discussion in their honor at the Institute of Politics Wednesday night.
Panelists did not specifically mention what additional security measures would be in place at the marathon next Monday, but they confirmed that there would be heightened law enforcement presence at the event, as well as counseling staff at hydration stations placed every mile along the race to assist runners who might have an intense emotional reaction while competing.
There was little concern expressed for Tuesday night’s supposed bomb scare, with panelists attributing the incident to there “being a lot of strange people in Boston.”
“It is remarkable the level of fearlessness we have the luxury of enjoying in this country; this was two people who caused this,” said Massachusetts Executive Secretary of Public Safety Andrea J. Cabral. “The fear that [this event] sprung on people, that this was happening on our soil, I can’t describe to you.”
Cabral was joined on the panel by former Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis, Executive Director of the Boston Athletic Association Thomas Grilk, and Adjutant General L. Scott Rice of the Massachusetts National Guard. Also in attendance were about 40 military and law enforcement officers who were also being honored by the IOP.
When discussion gravitated towards the logistical and emotional challenges of the week following the attack, the panel addressed issues of jurisdiction, vigilantes, and the need for rapid response and improvisation.
“One thing that really strikes me after going through with this is that the old military adage ‘No plan survives first contact with the enemy’ is absolutely true,” Davis said. “The command structure that’s laid out under our guidelines formed a platform, a framework, that allowed us to improvise.”
Davis also noted the extreme level of cooperation between agencies in the aftermath of the incident, claiming that there was “no lack of information, no lack of coordination among the people tactically involved.”
Local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies were all on site during the week following the bombing. According to Rice, 1,000 of the 9,000 members of the Massachusetts National Guard were deployed to the city within the first few days after the marathon.
“One of the things I like to teach and stress to the force, is that there’s something to being at the right place at the right time,” said Rice. “Our goal in domestic is to support all levels of local agencies when they respond… Our job to is make sure that they’re successful—we really talk about that and we really train for that.”
Questions were fielded from the audience on topics ranging from the change in police approach for similar events to student perceptions of law enforcement in the wake of the tragedy.
Event moderator and Harvard Kennedy School professor Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard concluded the events by calling the panelists his “heroes.”
“We are often asked here [at the IOP] who our heroes are,” Leonard said. “We get to see a lot of different things, and we get to talk about a lot of different things--my heroes are in this room. My heroes are the people who go out every day and do this kind of work, at risk and without much thanks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A group of Harvard Business School students has set out to help people navigate life transitions through LifeGuides.me, a collection of free online courses that allow students to learn from the experiences of mentors who have already been through similar challenges.
“We all have goals,” course mentor and Business School student Xiao Wang said. “The problem is that those goals tend to be very aspirational and very far away. That’s where Life Guides plays a role.”
To make their idea a reality, Life Guides founders and Business School students Phillip M. Strazzulla, Mohit Rajani, and Nicholas R. Christman joined the Harvard Innovation Lab’s Venture Incubation Program this semester. Earlier this year, they also began to bring together mentors who had been through significant life experiences and were willing to reflect on them.
Mentors design courses that guide users through challenges such as applying to business school, transitioning from military to civilian life, and successfully navigating a long-distance relationship. The site gets about 50 hits per day, half of which are repeat visitors, Rajani said.
Strazzulla said that the idea for the site came from an undergraduate summer internship at a financial firm that he did not enjoy. Mid-summer, he wrote a letter to remind himself of his unhappiness—that note later helped him overcome pressures to return to the lucrative job.
“Two minutes writing that memo saved two years of my life working at a job that I would not love,” Strazzulla said, noting that past experience allowed him to make the right life decision in this case. Life Guides seeks to provide access to mentors with these experiences to share, he said.
According to Wang, who is a mentor for a personal fitness course, Life Guides facilitates a change in mindset by giving individuals an “initial set of guideposts” to move them in the direction of their goals.
After pitching their idea to a group of entrepreneurs, Life Guides was accepted this semester into the Venture Incubation Program, in which teams share their ideas and get feedback from industry specialists and experts. Teams also receive a mentor for long-term guidance beyond the 12-week program.
“Many new entrepreneurs do not appreciate the number of things they have to juggle and how frequently they are out of their zone of expertise,” Patrick A. Kinsel, an entrepreneur and Life Guides mentor, said. “For that reason, the i-lab is hugely important because the speakers, panels, and other teams help each other work through issues so much more quickly than they could on their own.”
Looking forward, Rajani said that the Life Guides team hopes to provide a course for “every possible problem that you could face”—hundreds of courses, each with dozens of mentors.
 
Kinsel noted that the biggest challenge in the near future will be getting enough qualified mentors together to create effective, high-quality courses. “They will excel at really understanding the motivation behind people sharing their experiences,” he said. “It is a durable process once you get it going but hard to get off the ground.”
Strazzulla said that the mentorship and resources provided by the i-lab were instrumental in overcoming the hurdles faced by the entrepreneurial endeavor and will continue to ensure that Life Guides can improve the lives of thousands of users.
“If you had someone’s actual life experience in your back pocket, you could save yourself time, money, and stress,” he said.

 In 1955, English replaced Government as the most popular concentration among Harvard College freshmen. That’s right—back in the days before Sparknotes, hundreds of undergrads willingly signed up for English classes way before “Chick Lit” was even an option.
 Government—“the traditional leader”—fell to second place, while History and Social Relations came in third and fourth, respectively. Economics was the fifth most popular area of study (probably because the Class of 1955 had not yet been exposed to the glory of a Mankiw lecture). Nobody took CS classes because David Malan’s parents hadn’t had sex yet.
 
If you’re having trouble imagining a Harvard where students close-read poems not just to fulfill AIU, just remember that in 1955, times were different. Guys had to concentrate in the Humanities because there weren’t any girls around to do it for them. Most Harvard students were rich and didn’t need to find a real job after college anyway. Plus, we imagine that most Harvard English classes played out like a scene from Dead Poets’ Society (not the “Neil!” one). 
Take note that students chose their fields of concentration at the end of their first year. It’s unclear if under this system there was also an advising fortnight for freshmen to lie about attending.

Around 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, a contract employee for Harvard Energy and Utilities Services fell from a water cooling tower while working on the roof of the Science Center. According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal, the man “suffered significant injuries."
Harvard University Police and several ambulances responded to the accident. The employee was carried on a stretcher down from the roof.
“Medical personnel responded and have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” Neal said.
Elevators in the Science Center were shut off around 11:40 a.m. The elevator stop on the fifth floor of the Science Center, where authorities had gathered after the fall, remained locked at press time. Emergency services had vacated the building.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano could not be reached for comment at the time of publication. John P. Clougherty, the manager of the Harvard Operations Center, a subgroup of Campus Services that oversees energy and utilities, was also unable to be reached.
