After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The concept behind Brutalism, a postwar architetural aesthetic, figures prominently in Ted Leo and the Pharmacists’ (TL/Rx) sixth studio album, “The Brutalist Bricks.” Like the raw concrete buildings meant to reveal the structure and function of their rooms through their exteriors, the album’s tracks combine to embody what seems to be the LP’s primary purpose. “Bricks” seeks to remain true to TL/Rx’s punk roots and commitment to a diverse range of musical genres, while experimenting with the style that has elevated the band into the indie rock consciousness. The album is thus built on the same foundation as all of its predecessors—smart lyrics layered on gratifying hooks—a formula that, if not flawed, has at least become predictable. When the group does attempt to diverge from the prescribed, it is compelling only on tracks which prevent the innovation from becoming overwhelming.
The album emerges with “The Mighty Sparrow,” a characteristic TL/Rx opener infused with energy and saturated with references to politics and romance—let it never be said that songwriter and frontman Ted Leo values rhyme over reason. Kicking off with Leo yelling “When the café doors exploded / I reacted to, reacted to you,” this track is an imperative statement. Coming from TL/Rx, its forcefulness is expected, but so is everything else—the song is unsurprising and ordinary. As flawless a blend as Leo’s falsetto, a tight drum line, and a melodic guitar solo can be, there’s no particular charm in stating the obvious. About as Ted Leo as Ted Leo can get, “The Mighty Sparrow” is an introduction indicative of an album whose success lies predominantly in songs that integrate a refined creativity into the usual repertoire.
Take “Even Heroes Have to Die,” an assertive stance on the reality of growing old, which Leo—now nearing 40—appears to regard with poise rather than panic. Powered by dynamic acoustic guitar, the upbeat melody has Leo singing, “Even heroes have to die / No one lives forever / No one’s wise to try.” The song is more reminiscent of the enervating, passionate style TL/Rx presented on 2004’s undervalued “Shake the Sheets”—and a thankful departure from the seriously underwhelming “Living with the Living,” 2007’s contender for album most in need of an edit—but it possesses a graduated feel, creating an explosive pop tune that is both infectious and arresting.
The band reveals a brilliant glimmer of versatility on “One Polaroid A Day,” which establishes its place amongst the loveliest songs TL/Rx have produced. Leo exchanges falsetto for throaty, deep musings that complement the subdued nature of this track. With an understated drumbeat and strumming bass, “Polaroid” is far from succumbing to muteness or timidity. Instead, the song is a subtly crafted gem, whose force lies in the band’s ability to augment a knack for a catchy beat with a heretofore rarely seen phenomenon—Leo exercising his vocal range. The novelty extends to “Gimme the Wire,” where riveting electric guitar riffs far outplay the frontman’s singing. For a band that so frequently pummels its music with politically charged lyrics, it’s refreshing to hear the rhythm guitar jam with such fervor, thrill, and prominence (even if, perhaps, unintentionally).
Where “Bricks” falters, however, is on those tracks that trade a beautifully rounded sound for wavering efforts to be distinctive. “Tuberculoids Arrive in Hop” could be haunting, but it’s overworked, and the result is a strange amalgamation of shrill tones bookended by segments that appear to have been recorded outside. The song is certainly different, but its oddness is remarkable only because it distinguishes itself from much of the rest of the album, which suffers from the conclusion that nine years after breakout debut “The Tyranny of Distance,” TL/Rx can still rock out—it’s just standard fare by now.
With tracks meant to fit coherently and easily into the larger constitution of an improved TL/Rx, “Bricks” too easily shows its cracks. The album purports to flow as seamlessly as the textured Brutalist buildings of the postwar era. But while its foundations remain solid, upon closer examination, “Bricks” is more often a revelation of the band’s disjointed endeavor to fuse old with new.

The announcement of the Pavement reunion way back in September of 2009 understandably sent musically minded twentysomethings the world over into delighted shock. It was surreal and wonderful that the rumors were finally true, and the timing seemed perfect—announced 10 years after the band’s messy breakup, and 20 years after they recorded those fuzzy first singles at Louder Than You Think in Stockton, California. Since the news dropped, it’s been a bewildering experience for fans—buying tickets for shows over a year away, internalizing the band’s amusing nonchalance toward the whole event in countless interviews, and, just last week, watching shaky handheld videos of the first reunion shows half a world away in New Zealand and Australia. Some signs of old age emerged—guitarist Scott Kannberg revealed on his blog that at their first show back, frontman Stephen Malkmus played “Here” instead of “The Hexx” because he didn’t have his glasses on—but for the most part, the band remains stunningly unchanged. Always known for their boyish, shambling charm, they seem similar to their former selves of 10 or even 15 year ago. Bob Nastanovich still stands tambourine in hand, Malkmus’ haircut is identical, Mark Ibolds’ basslines and pigeon-like qualities remain pronounced.
And yet much has transpired since 1999. For one thing, four of five Pavement albums have been reissued as two-disc behemoths to welcome effect by Matador, the band’s longtime record label. Each reissue has been an exquisite treasure trove, packed with beautiful artwork and liner notes, live tracks and rarities, and previously unreleased material. From EPs to Peel Sessions to the songs they recorded for Cartoon Network’s “Space Ghost Coast to Coast,” the reissues have witnessed Pavement at their funniest (“Harness Your Hopes”), their most spontaneous (“For Sale: The Preston School of Industry”) and their most heartfelt (“All My Friends”), serving as true testaments to Pavement’s prolific grandeur and limitless creativity.
All of this makes the new release of “Quarantine the Past”—Pavement’s first greatest hits album—so baffling. The very existence of a greatest hits album for this band—whose closest approximation of a hit was 1994’s “Cut Your Hair,” which peaked at the giddy height of 10 on the Billboard Alternative Chart—seems more or less unnecessary, but even when one accepts the notion, this particular collection of songs proves frustratingly off. Many classics make the cut, and the band certainly showcases its versatility, but the album is hurt by glaring omissions and more than a few strange and self-indulgent selections.
The assortment follows no chronological order and spans the entire length of their career, though it is—somewhat unsurprisingly—heavily weighted toward the catalog from 1992 through 1994. This emphasis on the early part of their career is not in itself problematic, but one marvels at the omission of, for instance, epic “Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain” opener “Silence Kid,” when five other songs from that album are featured, including the pretty but slight “Heaven is a Truck.” Likewise, though many songs from the pre-debut album EPs make a welcome appearance—some of which (“Box Elder,” “Frontwards,” “Debris Slide”) provide undeniable signs of the band’s future greatness—others, like the screechy “Mellow Jazz Docent” seem completely out of left field. And second EP “Demolition Plot J-7” is completely neglected, despite containing the most flawless of their early love songs, the fuzzed-out, propeller-laden “Perfect Depth.”
The only album that seems properly given its due is 1997’s “Brighten the Corners,” which is granted four inclusions: the yelping, joyous classic rock song “Stereo;” the winding, wistful “Shady Lane;” the schizophrenic, sped-up “Embassy Row;” and Kannberg’s second-best song, “Date with IKEA.” Pavement’s sedate final album, “Terror Twilight,” gets the short shrift with just one track. Ethereal pop song “Spit on a Stranger” is a solid choice, but some additional context—either in the form of piano-driven ballad “Major Leagues” or swan song “Carrot Rope”—would perhaps have been helpful.
The most egregious injustice, though, is the disc’s treatment of 1995’s controversial masterpiece “Wowee Zowee.” Though detractors label “Wowee” undiscerning and disjointed, it seems unlikely that many would advocate for the inclusion of just two of its tracks on a greatest hits album, especially if one of these is the vaguely unsettling, strings and synth-heavy “Fight this Generation.” Inexplicably, this is chosen to end the compilation, despite its resemblance to a horrible Verlaines parody, creepily swirling around itself without going much of anywhere.
But “Quarantine the Past” should be granted a certain degree of forgiveness; many of the songs do in fact define the band and speak for themselves. It’s difficult to argue with the sun-kissed slow burn of “Summer Babe [Winter Version],” the Stone Temple Pilots jokes in twangy road jam “Range Life,” or the eerie, escalating guitar solos in “Grounded.” But once Malkmus and co. move past the singles into less obvious selections, they prove misguided, opting to include things like their jokey tribute to R.E.M. (“Unseen Power of the Picket Fence”) in place of the many solid rarities that pepper their reissues. In light of their outstanding original releases, generous reissues, and exciting reunion, “Quarantine the Past” is a disappointment—a functional, but far from ideal, introduction to the 90s’ finest indie rock band.

When two colossal icons from different musical worlds come together, the ensuing result can fall on a spectrum somewhere between two extremes. It can result in, at one end, an album that lacks any semblance of cohesion, where the styles fight furiously against each other to dominate. At the other end, the collaboration can result in an album greater than the sum of its two parts, where the combined styles complement each other so that an entirely novel sound emerges, one that neither musician could have produced alone. It is towards the latter end of this spectrum that we find Broken Bells, the new collaboration between James Mercer, lead singer of The Shins, and producer/musician Brian Burton a.k.a. Danger Mouse. The folk guitar strumming and soaring voice of Mercer fits impeccably into the hip-hop beats and electronic ambiance of Danger Mouse. However, a true synergy of the two styles never really comes across, leaving, simply, an undeniably catchy, though not terribly innovative, pop record.
Mercer has remained relatively consistent over the course of his career, fronting the Portland-based indie rock band The Shins for over a decade now. Danger Mouse, however, is known for branching out and mixing musical styles. His rise to fame came with 2004’s “The Grey Album,” which remixed Jay-Z’s “The Black Album” with the Beatles “The White Album”. Since then, Danger Mouse has never remained in one place, producing albums and creating beats with musicians like Gorillaz, Beck, and his own project with Cee-Lo Green, Gnarls Barkley. On “Broken Bells,” however, Danger Mouse is billed as Brian Burton, and has spoken of his desire to make clear that he is not just producing an album by another artist; Broken Bells is meant to be a stand-alone project. It’s hard to say from the debut, though, if it will stand as more than just a brief, albeit enjoyable, collaborative adventure.
For example, “The Ghost Inside” is arguably the most beguiling track on the album, yet it never transcends what the two individuals have previously created on their own. The song starts with a strong hip-hop beat and finds Mercer singing in a reverb-rich falsetto. Two-thirds in, it takes a turn and Mercer drops his voice down to his normal range where he is accompanied by the somewhat hackneyed vacillation of strings and heavy bass. The yearning and nomadic nature of Mercer’s voice traveling through Burton’s trip-hop setting is, as on most of Burton’s past productions, as intriguing as it is enjoyable.
While “The Ghost Inside” demonstrates how Mercer’s voice merges with Burton’s aesthetic, opener “The High Road” slips back and forth between two respective worlds, sounding more like The Shins as imagined by Danger Mouse then a project of its own. The song finds Mercer’s piercing voice singing a refrain with just the right amount of poeticism—“Cause they know and so do I / The high road is hard to find”—over an adroitly robotic synth melody. A poignant piano and bass bridge takes the song into a saccharine folk outro that sounds like it could have been lifted directly from a Shins album.
Mercer and Burton largely stick to their basic styles, and thus their joint product is not as experimental or original as one might have hoped. The sole creative peak is “Sailing to Nowhere,” which takes a number of surprising turns, beginning by oscillating back and forth between two different riffs until a swell of cosmic synth noises emerges, climaxing in an explosion of strings and an electric guitar solo. The transient nature of “Sailing to Nowhere” makes it one of the most captivating songs on the album, and shows what other tracks could have become if the group had taken a few more risks.
For the most part, however, Broken Bells avoid the pitfalls of high-profile collaboration, creating a safe yet strong album. But when names such as Danger Mouse and The Shins are dropped together, more than just a risk-free pop-album is going to be expected, and this potential is never fully realized here. If Mercer and Burton want Broken Bells to continue as a band, they will have to step just a bit further than this.

The Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc) gave its third performance of the season this past Saturday in Paine Hall. Under the baton of Yuga J. Cohler ’11, BachSoc presented Prokofiev, Poulenc, Mozart, and the premiere of “Nightclub Scenes,” a student piece created for the orchestra’s annual composition competition. Because of its modest size, the performance was intimate and inviting, maintaining a high standard throughout.
The evening began with Sergei Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 1 in D major. The piece established the neo-classical flavor of the night’s first three works with sweeping, sometimes dissonant harmonies punctuated by pizzicato and sharp percussion. Cohler presented the third and fourth movements with an especially tasteful choice of tempi that allowed his musicians to end the piece with a rapid, energetic flourish.
This energy continued into Francis Poulenc’s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra in D minor, which featured 2009-10 Concerto Competition Winners Stephanie J. Brinton Parker ’10 and Lindsey R. Brinton ’12, who are sisters. The challenge of piano four hands is daunting for even accomplished pianists, but the sisters complemented each other’s performances both in terms of technique and stylistic expression. The interplay between them was so precise that it was difficult to tell which pianist was playing which phrase, creating a truly seamless piano performance. Though Poulenc rose to fame in France as an avant-garde composer in the early 1900s, he was an artist before his time. A century later in Paine Hall, his piano concerto still sounds dashingly innovative.
BachSoc then presented the highly anticipated premiere of 2009-10 Composition Competition Winner “Nightclub Scenes for Solo Piano and Orchestra,” by Zachary T. Sheets ’13. Though “Nightclub Scenes” fit nicely with the modern sound of Prokofiev and Poulenc, there was a distinctively jazzy, almost sultry feel to Sheets’s composition. Written as “a classically inspired piece with a sense of harmony rooted in jazz,” Sheets delegated the roles of the jazz band’s walking bass, tenor saxophone, and trumpet to the cello, viola, and violin, respectively. Tying the piece together was pianist Jennifer Chen ’11, whose performance evoked the mysterious sophistication of a nightclub. Sheets enraptured his musicians and audience alike, with the orchestra coming alive as they played his work.
Concluding the evening with Mozart’s Symphony No. 35 in D major, or the Haffner Symphony, BachSoc revealed the careful attention it paid to its selection of the evening’s works. The Haffner Symphony was a surprising segue from “Nightclub Scenes,” as it celebrated the classical period that influenced Prokofiev and Poulenc’s modern works. With Cohler conducting, BachSoc ended the Haffner Symphony with the exuberance that this work demands, as a final display of the refined sound that the orchestra conveyed throughout the night.

“This movie is often called a thriller or suspense, but it is simply about a mother... although this movie is not the right one to see with your mother.” This is how Bong Joon-ho—one of the leading directors of the current Korean film renaissance—introduced his most recent movie, “Mother,” on February 28th at the Harvard Film Archive. “I showed this movie to my mother last May, and since then, for seven months, we haven’t spoken a word about this film,” he said, implicitly summarizing the mélange of wit and sincerity in his work.
“Mother,” as Bong commented, is a film about a mother who devotedly dotes on her mentally-challenged, twentysomething son. The son, Do-joon, is eventually accused of murdering a high school student. Convinced of his innocence, his mother commits herself to exonerating him, a decision that highlights the macabre limits of maternal love. “Mother” is scheduled to be released on March 12 in the U.S.
Following a question from the audience apropos of lead actress Kim Hye-ja, Bong talked about the primary incentive of filming “Mother.”  “[I devised] a plan that would give me the opportunity to work with [Hye-ja],” he answered.
“In Korea, Kim Hye-ja is known as the iconic symbol of a mother. But, due to my perverted taste, I’ve always had this on-going suspicion that she was, in fact, a psycho, and I wondered if she ever had the chance to express her ‘psychotic-ness.’”
Bong also mentioned that after the basic storyline was completed, he met with Kim Hye-ja in a restaurant to discuss the film. To his delight, Kim was pleased with the plot, and the production ran smoothly thereafter. And while Bong was busy filming “The Host,” his co-screenwriter Park Eun-kyo—a former student from one of his screenwriting workshops—continued to polish the script.
Bong said, “[Park] was especially helpful as a collaborator mainly for two reasons: that Park was a woman, as the movie was about a mother, and that she was from the countryside, where the movie is set.”
In South Korea, Bong Joon-ho is known as one of the biggest blockbuster makers. His second film, 2003’s “Memories of Murder,” instantly became the fourth most watched movie in the country for that year. Considering the film dealt with a high degree of violence—a perverted serial killer who victimized numerous young women—its commercial success was monumental. “Memories” was also critically acclaimed, screening at several international film festivals, such as the Cannes Film Festival, London International Film Festival, and San Sebastian International Film Festival, the latter of which awarded Bong its Best Director award.
A larger breakthrough, however, was yet to come. “The Host,” which premiered in 2006 at the Cannes Film Festival, broke box office records in its home country with 13 million viewers in four months. The film focuses on a mutant monster generated by a U.S. Army laboratory which illegally dumped chemicals in the Han River (the “Seine of Seoul”). Bong was especially applauded for his ability to mix the conventions of a genre film—a monster film in this case—with his facetious social satire and the poignancy of familial bonds.
After the release of “The Host,” Bong began to receive international attention. The acclaimed French film journal Cahiers du cinéma ranked the movie as the third best film of 2006. Film critic Wesley Morris from The Boston Globe also listed “The Host” as the ninth best movie of 2007, after it premiered in the States.
At the reception following the screening of “Mother,” Bong left a personal message to Harvard students concentrating in film studies: “About 15 years ago, I was also a student studying cinema—some bitter-sweet memories. You must feel the same way.”
“I hope you come up with unprecedented and unconventional movies—I will look forward to them,” Bong said, this time without a hint of his trademark sarcasm.

“Don’t you think you’re being overdramatic?” asks Louise Harrington (Kelly E. Perron ’11)—mother of the fractious, dysfunctional family which “Five Finger Exercise” centers around—of her daughter’s tutor Walter (Noah J. Madoff ’12). “No,” he replies, “No, I don’t.” Walter’s acceptance of the melodramatic could be a motto for this production of the play, which emphasizes the satirical, over-the-top aspects of Peter Shaffer’s script while still finding room for more philosophical segments.
Shaffer’s body of work is an idiosyncratic mix of gloomy, meditative dramas and satirical comedies. “Five Finger Exercise,” which runs in the Loeb Experimental Theater through March 12, is the play that garnered him his first public acclaim in 1958, and it can’t seem to decide which side of that genre line it falls on. Despite a few missed notes, the cast very nearly reconciles these two disparate halves into a cohesive whole that entertains while confronting serious questions of family, responsibility, and class.
“Five Finger Exercise” follows Louise Harrington and her husband Stanley (Matthew J. DaSilva ’12), whose conflicting attitudes towards culture are at one point described as “the difference between the salon and the saloon.” They force these views on their two children: the artistically-inclined Clive (Stewart N. Kramer ’12) and his abrasive but endearing younger sister Pamela (Vanessa B. Koo ’12).
Divided by class, culture, and aspirations, the four are engaged in a constant struggle of wills, mercilessly manipulating each other for personal gain. “This isn’t a family,” Clive declares in one of the play’s more melodramatic moments, “it’s a tribe of wild cannibals. We eat everything we can.” The arrival of Walter—a young German tutor who embodies the tormented intellectual that Clive aspires to be and the cultivated manner Louise values so highly—urges the familial culture war to new heights.
Walter’s unwitting participation in the family’s tangled romantic web provides narrative thrust, but the true purpose of the play is to investigate the dialectic between art and work, between high culture and low, as well as the challenges and responsibilities of family.
The complex interplay between characters demands much from the actors in a play that finds room for both comedic and dramatic moments. For the most part, the cast pulls it off. Kramer delivers as Clive, nailing the desperate, angst-ridden teen with a deliberately exaggerated performance, allowing for ambiguity concerning how much of his persona is affectation and how much is real anguish.
The script, as well as his pertinence to college students, places Clive firmly in the central role, but the other four cast members provide ample support. Koo has exceptional chemistry with Kramer, and Perron affects the earnest but obviously artificial upper-class airs of Louise with panache. While the cast occasionally misses the script’s dramatic peaks, especially in the slow-boiling first act, by the play’s climatic moments they’ve settled into their characters. As the simmering tension finally explodes, Madoff and DaSilva in particular provide a deeply affecting finale that gets the play’s significant messages across effectively, if unsubtly.
A sprawling, deliberately worn set takes full advantage of the Loeb Ex’s black box space. Staging and lighting are mostly unobtrusive, allowing the actors to carry the play. Sound design plays a larger role—piano interludes complement the household’s cultural conflicts, while a battered turntable that sticks frequently punctuates the play’s powerful final moments. Overall, the production is fairly sparse, which accentuates the dreary gloom of the Harrington family’s relationships and takes the edge off some of the potential melodrama.
“Five Finger Exercise” never quite resolves its internal genre conflict, and this production doesn’t solve that dilemma. Instead, it does its best to balance the two sides—satirical comedy and more serious meditation—and mostly succeeds, even if the latter half sometimes gets a little lost in the process.

It has never been easy to understand the connection between—let alone the mass market success of—a band made up of Britpop star Damon Albarn, comic book artist Jamie Hewlett, and a series of featuring artists that now includes hip-hop producer Danger Mouse, rock legend Lou Reed, and the Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. It is even more surprising that these disparate figures, who collectively form Gorillaz, have built a reputation as a hip-hop group. In fact, Gorillaz has always been more influenced by comparatively esoteric genres.
In their latest effort, Gorillaz forego much of the rap/pop sensibility that had previously characterized them for mainstream fans and vaulted them to the Top 40. Instead, “Plastic Beach” delves into eccentric, challenging, and subdued forms of electronica that are morphed by a diverse set of other genres, from classical to funk. This shift is most apparent in the album’s focus on musical production rather than traditional narrative-based songwriting. With the exception of a few rap songs, vocal lines on “Plastic Beach” create only vague impressions, feelings, or associations.
Most important in this artistic development is the dominant theme that characterizes “Plastic Beach:” the meaninglessness of a mechanized external world and our attempts at real human connection within this oppressive order. For Gorillaz to express the plasticity of this world in conventional rap would be disingenuous, and their turn from this language toward a less human and electronic musicality represents a broader investment in a synthetic experience. Though there are moments where the transition is rough and incomplete, “Plastic Beach” represents a maturation for Gorillaz.
The conspicuous shortcomings of the album come on tracks that are limited by a rap vocabulary. “Sweepstakes,” which features Mos Def, contains the album’s only mention of stock hip-hop figures, as the rap star confidently spits, “There’s rappers and dealers and players and me / They say that they’re winners / Okay, well let’s see.” Not only are these rhymes depressingly conventional, but worse, they cast the beats in the background, thereby preventing the best aspect of “Plastic Beach” from shining through. This same problem is present on “White Flag,” in which banal rhymes ultimately dominate the fantastic opening of the Lebanese orchestra, who create an exotic and fast-paced rhythm through deep, resonating hand drums, a lighthearted flute, and a frenetic violin.
“Plastic Beach” shines brightest when its themes are more carefully unpacked. The most telling evocation of the theme of plasticity comes in “Some Kind of Nature.” Lou Reed is just the right man to feature in the song, his aloof monotone casually capturing the essence of the repetitive and opaque lyrics—“Some kind of mixture / Some kind of gold / Some kind of majesty / Some chemical load / Some kind of metal made up from glue / Some kind of plastic I could wrap around you.” While these lyrics present nothing in the way of narrative or even clear subject matter, the concepts of industrial fakeness and natural richness seem partially reconciled, as a “chemical load” is put on the same level as “gold” and “majesty.” The world only exists in “some kind” of things, indistinct and vague. Nonetheless, this unreality is finally comforting; “some kind of plastic” is depicted as a sort of blanket. We may be surrounded by the synthetic, but in the end this artificiality can be used as something real, even useful and protecting.
The following track, and arguably the album’s best song, “On Melancholy Hill,” provides a rare moment where a developed storyline expands on the album’s themes. Albarn is pitch-perfect in his contribution to a gentle, wistful synth line and light drumming, singing, “Up on melancholy hill / There’s a plastic tree / Are you here with me? / Just looking out on the day / Of another dream.” Reality does not exist in this world where nature is “plastic” and days are nothing more than “dreams.”  What is tangible, however, is the meaning of human connection—“Well you can’t get what you want / But you can get me / So let’s set up and see / Cause you are my medicine / When you’re close to me,” Albarn touchingly trills. The instrumentals and vocals combine in the exact same sort of sad, removed charm. Though Albarn’s voice can become incomprehensible, it is the soft sound of his warble that ultimately matters most and perfectly blends into the beat of the song.
Indeed, the line between lyrics and music is blurred throughout “Plastic Beach.” In their departure from rap and its focus on language, in search of a new, more sonic form of musical expression, Gorillaz have made their music and lyrics blend to form what is often no more than raw sound. An appropriate decision—after all, what could speak the language of plastics and machines better than pure noise?

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Princeton student smoke, but just look at all of you here,” remarked Jeffrey Eugenides—the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Middlesex” and “The Virgin Suicides”—of the cigarette smoke that veiled the audience and room at an event at The Harvard Advocate last Tuesday. After reading a passage from the novel that he is working on, Eugenides—a creative writing professor at Princeton and alum of Brown—answered questions from a crowd that spilled into the kitchen and onto the stairs. Eugenides mainly fielded questions about his writing process—revealing the difficulties, pleasures, and surprises that he encounters on the way.
“The hardest thing is when you have a new idea while writing something else. Sometimes, I take the adulterous route and write a short story—the equivalent to a literary fling. Certain stories just seize you and you feel compelled to go write them,” he said.
Eugenides articulated this delicate juggling act of being disciplined enough to complete a work, yet flexible enough to abandon a nonviable idea for a more captivating one. For Eugenides, this discipline also means being able to let go of a story.
“I was living in Berlin at the time so my editor flew in and took Middlesex off of my desk and back to America,” Eugenides recounted. “I tend to doubt my work a lot. I’m always reading it through for flow and messing with it again. It’s not the most effective way, but I enjoy writing that way… I wrote ten openings for “Middlesex” before finding the right one. That was eight hundred to a thousand pages in the trash.”
But, though Eugenides is an extremely meticulous writer, he recalled how good fortune prodded him into writing “Middlesex”—a novel brimming with themes of fate and destiny. “I was at the artistic colony Yaddo, trying to write the opening with the burning of Smyrna in 1922 without having done my research. But it just sounded so false. I was desperate; I thought I had to give [“Middlesex”] up, so I wandered downstairs where there was a stack of books left for anyone’s use on the table. One was Smyrna 1922. I picked it up, went back to my room to read it, and started writing again.”
Though Eugenides is half-Greek and “Middlesex” is centered on the ancient traditions of tragedies, epics, and myth, he confessed that the novel is less autobiographical than might be expected—drawing from his personal background more for literary authenticity than plot.
“With ‘Middlesex,’ I was writing about a character who was very different from me,” he said. The main character, Cal, has a genetic mutation and is intersex. “I had to find connections to my own life to make him seem credible so I invested Cal with details about me—he grew up in Detroit where I grew up and was born the year I was born. I needed an autobiographical ground to build this fictional narrative.”
In the novel he is working on now, Eugenides has used this same technique. The story takes place at a college in 1982—and Eugenides himself graduated from Brown University in 1983. But he also discussed the difficulty in treading the line between credibility from autobiographical aspects and the creativity and distance needed for a successful narrative.
“I took a year off from college and spent it in Calcutta working with Mother Teresa. I’ve tried to write about it for 20 years and I’m now doing it. I’m having such difficulty. The passage just gets shorter and shorter—maybe it will disappear altogether. It’s just so hard to write about yourself—easier to imagine another life because then everything has equal weight. This is why I don’t trust memoirs—I believe they need fictionalizing to write.”
While Eugenides’ characters in successive novels remain in youth—from boys dealing with a town tragedy in “The Virgin Suicides,” to Cal coming of age in the flux of 20th century America, and to college students studying semantic theory while carrying on a passionate affair on the side—he continues to be surprised about how much can remember from his own recent past.
“Semantic theory, which I learned and grappled with at twenty-two, still affects how I deal with writing. Books are generated by other books. In college and right after was when I was most voracious with books,” he said. He advised aspiring writers in the audience, “Take them and digest them within you to form this nutritive bed.”

Titus Andronicus named themselves after Shakespeare’s goriest play. Just as this would imply, their lo-fi punk rock sound abounds with vocal violence and instrumental incursions. The band’s 2008 debut album, “The Airing of Grievances,” was a blast of anger and furious rock infused with a surprising amount of humor. Lyrics and song titles, as well as the album’s title referencing the “Seinfeld” holiday of “Festivus,” were a foundation for the album’s unrelenting energy. “The Monitor” is very much a continuation of the band’s debut, still laden with lead singer Patrick Stickles’ vociferous shouts and loud yet boisterous guitar solos. It’s certainly understandable that the band’s sophomore release hasn’t deviated much from their original formula, and neither is it a problem, as Titus Andronicus’ sound is still fresh and exciting.
“The Monitor,” named after the Civil War ironclad ship, is ostensibly a concept album centered on living in our times and questioning identities, with a focus on the lingering importance of the Civil War. The songs run into each other without gaps as the group focus on building a narrative exploring the oppressive ideologies of living in America today, questioning our times with references to the context of the ideological shifts of the Civil War.
Though “The Monitor” takes up this new narrative, Titus Andronicus focus most on maintaining the anti-suburban message of their debut, describing their irreverent, sometimes self-loathing, enthusiasm for their roots. On “Theme From ‘Cheers,’” this irreverence takes the form of a drinking song dealing with youthful drowning of sorrows and building of friendships with alcohol and cigarettes. Other times, the band deals with their inability to escape personal repugnance, such as when they chant the mantra of “You will always be a loser” in “No Future Part Three: Escape From No Future.”
“A More Perfect Union,” the album’s sprawling seven-minute opener, sets the tone for the narrative. Sickles sets in with loud vocals summarizing a journey out of Titus Andornicus’ native New Jersey into the American unknown. Cynically invoking Springsteen, he screams, “I’m looking for a new New Jersey / Cause tramps like us / Baby we were born to die.” Driving guitar riffs and drum beats move the song forward, as the song builds to a climaxing chorus. Lyrics continuously question the anxiety and angst of Stickles’ view of America, leading into the chants of “The enemy is everywhere” on the punk rock of the following transitional song, “Titus Andronicus Forever.”
While most songs are similarly aggressive, “Four Score and Seven” proceeds at a much slower pace. Over sparse guitar and cello, Sickles cries out against the divisions the narrator of the album encounters—“This is a war we can’t win / After 10,000 years it’s still us against them.” The song slowly crescendos into a restrained chorus followed by a battered-sounding yet triumphant brass band and an exultant guitar solo, as Sickles continues to scream “It’s still us against them.” Even when the aggression of the music is reduced, the forcefulness of the lyrical narrative remains.
The album’s 14-minute long closing song, “The Battle of Hampton Road,” is named after the Civil War clash between the Monitor and the Merrimack, but actually it focuses mainly on 20th Century concerns. Sickles proclaims “I’m destroying everything that would make me like Bruce Springsteen / So I’m going back to New Jersey / I do believe they’ve had enough of me.” By directly disavowing this connection, Titus Andronicus only strengthen it, making this album a statement about the New Jersey and America of our times, a more furious, sardonic Springsteen for the 2010s.
Although the overarching concept of “The Monitor” is certainly heavy, Titus Andronicus’s goal is extremely admirable, and leads to some grand compositions. Building on their past sound and working to solidify it, “The Monitor” showcases the band’s thoroughly entertaining vision. Though their talent may still be a little rough, and hasn’t yet fully come to fruition, the fury and power of Titus Andronicus is undeniable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a sunny day. A couple of kids are hanging out, playing around with some old shopping carts they found lying around. And that’s when it happens. Students come streaming out of the nearby school in a state of shock. One of their teachers has opened fire during an assembly, killing three students and one teacher. The scene cuts to the hard-boiled policewoman whose job it is to sort out the mess. This simple exposition could be the beginning of any of the popular crime dramas shown almost constantly on television.
As it happens, this scene is also the one that unfolds in the first two chapters of Simon Lelic’s new novel, “A Thousand Cuts.” Lelic has mastered the tropes of the police drama. The book follows an order predictable to any viewer of such programs: exposition followed by introduction of law enforcement officials, whose own battles are then interspersed with testimony. Each witness’s deposition is even separated into a new chapter, much in the same way that “Law and Order” introduces a new witness by calling up a new screen with a characteristic two-note segue.
These shows may be wildly popular, but they don’t aspire to much more than a standard formula. If Lelic is to be successful, he must rise above the inherent constraints in such a form. However, unless his novel is intentionally commenting on society’s desire for an easy arc from obscene murder to thrilling conviction, it never rises above a simple copy of a tried and true blueprint.
Lelic’s plotline centers on a school shooting in which Mr. Szajkowski—a teacher who everyone agrees was always strange—walks into a school assembly and opens fire on students and teachers alike. Inspector Lucia May is assigned the case. As the only woman in a heavily alpha-male office, it isn’t hard for her to feel empathy for the awkward new history teacher whose bullies—both the students and a fellow teacher—she believes drove him to the point of insanity. As May fights to hold the school responsible for turning a blind eye to Szajkowski’s tormentors, she too is tormented by her colleagues who try and make it clear that the force is no place for a woman.
The narrative alternates between May’s story of increasing isolation and frustration with the police department, and testimony from various witnesses who saw the same thing happen to Szajkowski. As the petty bullying adds up, it is not difficult to see the underlying reason for the book’s title and its main characters’ drastic actions.
Basing a book around a police officer and the various testimonies she solicits may be a worn-out trope, but it must have provided an interesting exercise for Lelic. Lelic’s characters come from all walks of life, and he especially relishes in his attempts to mimic their speech. These narratives can be alternatively funny, melodramatic, and occasionally convincing. Other times however, they can be patently ludicrous.
One of the plotlines involves the bullying of another student, who receives threatening text messages. “Njoy yor vzit 2 d hospital. I hOp dey mAk U beta so we cn fck U up agen,” reads a typical one. It seems that Lelic wants to prove that he understands the workings of cyber-bullying and all the newfangled technology kids use, but he doesn’t seem to realize that true texting-speak involves much more than the removal of as many letters as possible.
Lelic is more successful when he returns to the world of adults, where he displays a mastery of the small details that make up normal, working lives. He writes, “Lucia May moved from the seating area towards the kitchenette. She opened the door of the microwave and then shut what she found back inside. The smell escaped, though – sweet, artificial, she thought, low calorie.” With descriptions like these, Lelic captures modern life far more effectively than he does with his aping of teens’ texting styles or his awkward insertions of pop culture references into his witnesses’ dialogue.
Unfortunately, Lelic attempts to elevate his book beyond a simple description of life as we know it, trying to tackle tough issues like school shootings and sexism in the workplace. When reaching for this, his dialogue takes on a stilted quality, and ultimately the book never rises above the level of the cliché.
In one scene, May has gone too far in her quest against the establishment and her boss confronts her: “‘And you.’ The chief inspector looked at Lucia. ‘You, take the day off. Take the week off if you want. You blew it. I gave you a chance and blew it. Now the both of you: get the fuck out of my office.’” Dialogue such as this is virtually indistinguishable from that which could found—profanity excepted—on any crime drama. Lelic starts with a very familiar form, and he fails to make it his own. Instead he bets on riding the coattails of television shows, hoping that their success will be enough to keep his book afloat. It’s a gamble that ultimately fails.

In James Wood’s popular class “Postwar British and American Fiction,” the first half of a lecture is invariably devoted to Wood reading aloud his favorite excerpts from the book under discussion. “Flip to page twenty-nine where Nabokov writes, ‘The cat, as Pnin would say, cannot be hid in a bag.’” Wood grins, before eagerly pushing forward, “Ah, yes, yes! There’s a great bit four pages earlier when Pnin gets dentures and Nabokov describes his tongue as ‘a fat sleek seal, [which] used to flop and slide so happily among the familiar rocks, but now not a landmark remained.’”
“What do you think about this passage?... Why is it funny?... Is it funny at all?... Is there another phrase you liked?... What made you laugh?” Wood asks. At first the students are taken aback by this barrage of surprisingly personal questions. After a half-minute of silence one girl gathers the courage to ask Professor Wood what the passage meant. He leans back chuckling in his chair before reassuringly answering, “Oh, I don’t have much to say about that bit. I’ve just always found it a good laugh.” Looking back on the class, I now realize Wood’s response is the most genuine reaction to the passage.
The professor’s unusual approach to lecturing immediately immerses his students in the milieu of the novel through short, funny excerpts, but more importantly it gives students permission to enjoy reading a book. Many students, who often feel afraid to laugh while reading,  find his method liberating. Yet, initially I was more annoyed than charmed by these recitations. I felt these comic details contributed very little to the analytical understanding of a novel; the excerpts gave a sense of a writer’s prose style, but ultimately they were nothing more than amusing diversions to give the class a few laughs before tackling the real issues of a book. I soon found I was wrong.
The ability to appreciate the comedic aspects of any great novel can expose new dimensions of a book’s complexities. An author can often reveal invaluable insights into a character’s personality through humorous details about his comic foibles or silly idiosyncrasies. Humor can be used equally well to humanize or ironize a character. But while the specific literary effects of humor vary from book to book, comedy serves as a surprisingly perceptive avenue to examine many novels.
William Faulkner’s modernist classic “The Sound and the Fury” has the reputation as one of the most formidable and tragic novels in the American canon. Surprisingly, appreciating Faulkner’s comedy has drastically changed my perception of the book. “The Sound and the Fury” concerns the disintegration of the Compson family, a declining aristocratic Southern clan living on a once-prosperous plantation. The first three sections are written from the point of view of the three Compson brothers: the mentally retarded Benjy, the suicidal Harvard student Quentin, and the cruel and domineering Jason. When I first tried to read the novel in high school, I stopped midway through the third section from spiritual exhaustion. Only after reading the entire novel did the illuminating role of comedy became apparent.
The humor in “The Sound and the Fury” articulates the roles of the three Compson brothers in the family’s decline. The comedic power of the novel is most evident in the third section, narrated in the bitterly sardonic voice of Jason. The tone abruptly changes with the first sentence of the section when Jason announces, “Once a bitch always a bitch, what I say.” The fatalistic overtones of this decree permeate Jason’s narration as he mocks almost every character he meets. Faulkner uses Jason’s cruel humor as the primary representation of Jason’s universal aggression towards life.
It can be difficult to sympathize with Jason, who embezzles from his own mother, constantly mocks kind and hard-working people, and prevents his own sister from visiting her daughter. Jason’s rage even spreads to general targets as he explains his philosophy on relationships: “I never promise a woman anything nor let her know what I’m going to give her... Always keep them guessing. If you can’t think of any other way to surprise them, give them a bust in the jaw,” revealing that the only venue for his restless energy is physical or psychological violence.
Jason is filled with the energy and ambition that Quentin lacks, but is equally self-destructive. He seems to be a different manifestation of the Compson family’s downfall—Jason’s satiric musings reveal his own frustrations and insecurities, but more importantly demonstrate that he is aware of how thoroughly dysfunctional his family is. The Compsons are trapped by their family’s history and heritage; Quentin commits suicide because, among other things, his sister Caddy has corrupted the family honor with her promiscuity. Humor is the vehicle that Jason uses to separate himself from the pressure of his family name. He is the one Compson brother who knows he must escape his family, but cannot initially muster the strength to do so.
Humor transforms Jason from a cruel antagonist into the tragic yet triumphant epicenter of the novel. In the novel’s appendix Faulkner writes that Jason “assumed the entire burden of the rotting family in the rotting house” before he “was able to free himself forever [from] the idiot brother and the house.” Faulkner reveals that Jason sells the Compson estate and puts his brother in an insane asylum—effectively dismantling his family’s history. Some might view this ending as tragic, but it is also triumphant. Towards the end of Jason’s entry in the appendix, Faulkner includes the exultations, “He was emancipated now. He was free.” The last remnants of high Southern white society crumble away as the individual enters modernity. Jason destroys one world to enter another. Though Jason’s sardonic outlook leads him to sacrifice his family’s proud history, it also allows him to find individual liberation.

Ezra Pound once declared that to write free verse was “to compose in the sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of a metronome.” Free verse has become one of the dominant styles of poetry—encompassing the long rhythmic lines of Allen Ginsberg and the short, understated verse of current Poet Laureate Kay Ryan. Amid this prevalence of fluidity in poetic style, “Mean Free Path,” Ben Lerner’s third book of poetry, stands out in its reactionary innovation. “Mean Free Path” is an experiment aiming for the reconstruction, not dismantlement, of poetic forms. Lerner’s book invents a new form as recognizable and systematic as the old ones.
Since the beginning of his poetic career, Lerner has experimented with form and structure. His first collection, “The Lichtenberg Figures,” is entirely composed of sonnets, while his second, “Angle of Yaw,” which was announced finalist for the 2006 National Book Award, is made up of prose poems. Having explored these two extremes, Lerner is now searching for something in between—a form that includes the structure of sonnet and the freedom of prose.
The result of this search is his new collection, “Mean Free Path.” The book is comprised of intimate verse narratives, addressed to a certain “Ari,” who seems to be the narrator’s confidant, or perhaps a lover. The narrator touches on thoughts about everyday life and discusses beauty, love and literature as if he were lying in bed beside Ari, chatting before sleep, almost whispering.
The strength of “Mean Free Path” lies in its air of intimacy. The subjects of the poems range widely from the most quotidian matters­—the act of looking up from reading a book—to the gravest ones—the death of a friend. By including the trivial alongside the serious, Lerner creates the illusion of conversation with a close friend. He writes, “I want this to be... a little path / For Ari... That’s why I speak / In a voice so soft.” The familiar tone, or the “voice so soft,” supports the content of the collection.
In order to deliver on this intimacy, Lerner has attempted to invent an entirely new form, rather than following the pre-existing structure of the sonnet or writing with the openness of free verse. He strictly regulates meter, punctuation, and stanza breaks, but not without constant and subtle variations, which permit his poems to avoid what Pound denounced as the “sequence of a metronome.”
The form, along with the content, renders the book a single, prolonged conversation. At first glance, “Mean Free Path” appears to be a collection of short, untitled poems. But here, the absence of titles is significant; the obscured distinction between poems is strengthened by Lerner’s intentional thematic repetition. That is, thoughts that were mentioned at the beginning of the book are repeated throughout the book over and over again—often in the same exact words; somewhat as if Lerner were attempting a modernized sestina.
Lerner’s dynamic use of punctuation gives an added shape to his sequences. His lines are almost always broken by a caesura, dramatically moderating the flow of his verse. “It cannot save us. But it can remind us / Survival is a butcher’s goal. All hands / To the pathos. Let the credits,” he writes. The poet explains that this is “a structure of feeling / Broken by hand.” Alternatively, Lerner also often leaves out punctuation, leaving sentences unfinished, imitating the rhythm of real conversations. The last sentence of the excerpt mentioned above—“Let the credits”—in fact ends there, abruptly.
At times, however, Lerner seems to be too preoccupied with the notion of the synthesis of form and content. One of the most frequent subjects of the collection is its own form. “Do not hesitate / To cut the most beautiful line in the name / Of form,” Lerner writes. Not only do these recurrent comments on the poetic form become redundant, but they also subtract attention from other sentiments expressed in the collection.
There are also instances where Lerner’s voice becomes too colloquial. Lines such as “removing the suicide / From the speed dial,” or, “There are some cool pics online,” detract from the other accomplishments of his work. These phrases solely function as a distraction from his more serious and beautiful ones such as, “we could spend our lives / Parting in stations, promising to write / War and Piece.”
Nevertheless “Mean Free Path” succeeds in creating a fresh style of poetry. Despite some wrong notes, Lerner has undoubtedly achieved a moving manifestation of our daily contemplations. Its structure, innovative as it is, manages to narrate the everyday sentiments of human life as they actually occur: in bits and pieces.

“Alice in Wonderland” holds true to the fascinatingly eerie vibe synonymous with the Tim Burton brand but leaves much to be desired in the realm of plot innovation. The film fast-forwards many years after Alice’s (played by newcomer Mia Wasikowska) initial visit to Wonderland, depicting a 19 year-old Alice who has forgotten her prior experiences. The subsequent journey ensues when she discovers her hidden destiny to take down the reign of the stifling Red Queen, played by Helena Bonham Carter.
Although it excels as a visually engaging film, the story plods along a little too neatly, complete with a cookie-cutter ending. However, the enthralling animation of the film at large makes for a solidly entertaining experience at the very least.
Despite the hopes that Burton would put his off-beat personal stamp on the material, the progression of events leading up to the final battle scene is entirely conventional, remaining predictable up until its final moments. Although the opening sequences are engaging and original, once Alice enters Wonderland, each scene is more foreseeable than the last. In fact, the film falls nicely into the standard fantasy epic plot, which is simply unaaceptable for an adaptation of “Alice in Wonderland.” Maybe this more mainstream approach is to be expected since some of Burton’s recent films like “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” try harder to reach to a wider audience with tacky jokes and characters that try to excel at self-conscious weirdness, but it is a disappointment nonetheless.
Its major redeeming quality is, as has long been expected from the colorful teaser images and trailers, its stunning visuals and special effects. Burton succeeds brilliantly at painting an astonishing Wonderland that is at once ominous and irresistibly intriguing. Much like Disney’s original animated film, “Alice in Wonderland” sets dark, foreboding tones around many of Alice’s new encounters. Especially when Alice first enters the rabbit hole, the looming doors and tattered walls cast a menacing environment that effectively looms over the miniscule Alice.
The skilled use of shadows and sinister clouds in contrast with the vibrant colors of the scenery throughout the entire film reflect the frightening effect that made the original such an absorbing portrayal of Lewis Carroll’s classic story. From the vivid costume design to the masterful depiction of the multi-colored Mad Hatter, played by Jonny Depp, this film steps up to the plate in film animation.
The state-of-the-art animation also allows for some reinvention of the classic Wonderland characters, which opens doors to some major differences. However, most of the traits that make certain characters—like the infamous Cheshire Cat—such distrustful personas are lost in this film. They seem to have toned down their trickery and traded it in for a more helpful, family-friendly approach to Alice’s strife. Wordplay and clever puns are still present, but the ever-cooperative actions of Alice’s companions do not match their tangled, devious verbal logic. The uncertainty surrounding Alice’s environment is thus lost, leading to a more comfortable depiction of her journey.
The generally bland dialogue is also a big disappointment. There is a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly delivered by the quick-witted Johnny Depp. However, for every clever joke there are more than a few clichéd lines. Alice’s cheesy monologue, describing the “six impossible things” that she has seen accomplished despite her disbelief (which culminates in the sixth declaration of  “I can slay the Jabberwock!”) is perhaps one of the most painfully tacky moments. And to top it all off, that climactic battle scene is soon followed by an unbearably saccharine dance sequence that threatens to undermine the stylistic credit the film has earned up to that point.
Despite its various interpretive downsides, “Alice in Wonderland” does in fact provide much wonder in its stunning animation and design. Yet, it is a shame to see Burton try so hard to please the masses with a standard fantasy epic plot and sprinklings of cheesy dialogue. Compared to his off-beat earlier works, this film definitely lacks the artistic risk-taking that makes for a quality film. Much like the “Avatar” sensation that took the nation by storm but whose plot rang a little too close to that of Pocahontas, “Alice in Wonderland” works its magic with eye-popping animation but falls short of achieving any kind of substantive originality or psychological stimulation.

Don’t go into “Brooklyn’s Finest” expecting a particularly innovative or intriguing crime film—it is certainly no “French Connection.” Director Antione Fuqua doesn’t retread his 2001 police drama “Training Day,” though if he had, “Brooklyn’s Finest” would have been much more satisfying. While boasting an all-star lineup, including Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke, and Wesely Snipes, the film remains a pedestrian melodrama.
The movie follows three interwoven stories concerning a single Brooklyn police precinct situated in the most violent part of the borough, all of which come together in a violent conclusion. In a concurrent storyline, the NYPD attempts to regain the community’s trust after an officer from the precinct shoots and kills an honor student from the projects.
Detective Salvatore “Sal” Procidia (Hawke) is a poor cop with a lot to lose. As the film progresses, Proicidia’s spouse falls increasingly ill due to a mold problem in their run-down home. In order to save his wife and their twins, Procidia must make a down payment for a new house in just a few days, but he doesn’t have nearly enough money. To meet his deadline, he turns to robbing drug dealers during busts, even going so far as to break into a dealer’s apartment after a bust gets canceled. Though this is the most compelling story in the film, Hawke’s performance is forgettable and uninspired, lacking any of the conviction or depth he displayed as Jake Hoyt in “Training Day.” In the end, Procidia comes off as a whiney hothead who can’t see that the end doesn’t always justify the means, and he gets what he deserves.
Other actors, however, fare slightly better. Gere plays Officer Eddie Dugan, who has a week left until his retirement. This has been the day he has been living for during his time of service, and his lack of drive is evident from his fellow officers’ disdain for him. After his retirement, Dugan loses his only connection to another person, his sometime prostitute. With absolutely nothing left, Dugan finally decides to act in a final dramatic­­­—and clichéd—scene. Through his intentionally flat acting, Gere provides the lifelessness and lack of soul the character of Dugan needs, making the performance quite admirable given the limited role that Gere has to work with.
The stories of Detective Clarence “Tango” Butler (Cheadle) and Casanova “Caz” Phillips (Snipes) are interwoven in the film. Butler is an undercover narcotics cop in the projects, who has risen to the top of the business over the past few years. However, when Phillips, Butler’s old prison buddy and formerly powerful drug dealer, gets released from incarceration, problems arise. Cheadle is as charismatic as ever, endowing his character with the most emotion and authentic passion in the entire film. Snipes, while not as strong as Cheadle, also successfully expresses the fear and panic of his character, who has fallen from great heights and is now trapped in his former life, unable to escape.
One of the most puzzling aspects of the film is the fact that Fuqua never makes effective use of the film’s actual New York location, excluding several overhead shots of the projects. In fact, the only neighborhood in Brooklyn mentioned in the entire film is Bedford-Stuyvesant, and that is only in passing. On top of using essentially stock characters in the script, Fuqua does nothing to give the film any legitimate New York feel.
From the film’s unoriginal storyline to the overly violent and unnecessary massacre that punctuates its conclusion (the ending of the film was reshot following a poor reception at a screening at Sundance this year), “Brooklyn’s Finest” affords little recommendation other than its stellar cast.

Some movies have unfaithful endings—the kind that don’t follow from their characters’ motivations, prior events or clues, and couldn’t possibly have been predicted by viewers at any point in the storyline. Imagine if “Twelve Angry Men” had ended with the one obstinate juror pulling out an M-16 and mowing down his uncooperative colleagues. “The Good Guy” is kind of like that, except it’s not just the ending.
This is the sort of movie where it almost feels as though the person who wrote the second page never read the first. A film where a character can tell a girl that he likes “Pride and Prejudice” because it reminds him of the hazards of first impressions, and then in the next scene be found rereading the book, explaining “I just met a girl who reminds me of Elizabeth Bennett.” Is he not listening to his own dialogue? The movie often gives that impression.
Worse still, rookie writer/director Julio DePietro doesn’t seem to realize that if you have to give your characters frontal lobotomies periodically to make your plot work and get your message across, there’s probably something fundamentally wrong with the script. The problem is that when a filmmaker both writes and directs, there’s no one there to point this out.
Saddled with the impossible task of portraying these discontinuous characters are a trio of television actors who apparently had slim pickings when it came to selecting their launch vehicle to the silver screen. Scott Porter (“Friday Night Lights”) plays the dashing Tommy Fielding, who looks to the audience like a high school senior doing his internship at a Wall Street firm, but whom the film helpfully tells us is actually a stock broker there. Painted from the start as “the good guy” in a depraved world full of cut-throats and egotists, Fielding is dating the lovely Beth Vest (Alexis Bledel of “Gilmore Girls” and “Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants”). Bryan Greenberg (“One Tree Hill”) is Daniel Seaver, the nerdy yet hunky computer guy at the brokerage firm whom Tommy gives a shot at a real finance job.
What follows is a predictable love triangle in which Fielding’s protégé slowly grows closer with Fielding’s girlfriend. But to move us along without waiting for such inconveniences as “character development,” the script decides to just drastically rewrite the personalities of the main cast on the fly.
Hence, there is Dan’s miraculous transformation from a borderline autistic into a Wall Street whiz who is also the life of Beth’s book club. (It’s a girls-only book club, but this film is far too clever to be derailed by such trivialities as believability.) Similarly, Beth trades men like Daniel trades personalities. It seems Tommy’s job keeps him too busy to hang out every single second of their screen-time, and so naturally she gravitates towards the only other male character in the story. Oh, and in case it’s not abundantly obvious, all-American Tommy is not what he seems either. At one point, in a particularly egregious move, the film even has him lie to the audience in narration, just so they don’t catch on. Really.
Almost as frustrating as this cardboard characterization is the fact that scattered throughout this rather awful movie are the makings of a very good one.  Director DiPietro is just in the wrong genre. Whenever the film strays into the territory of romantic comedy, it actually works. The lines are funny, the soundtrack is snappy, and the atmosphere is ideal. The actors are winning, if cookie-cutter, and know how to tell a joke. DiPietro is also a very artful showman, able to convey his characters’ emotions through unlikely angles and lush camera work. When his characters change—however absurdly—so does the film’s landscape. Unfortunately, DiPietro decided to try and teach his audience members a life lesson instead of just making them laugh.
“The Good Guy” is, in a word, contrived. The people in it are props, with actions dictated by the director just as much as anything else on screen. In this way, the film manipulates its characters, its plot, and its audience to teach a pseudo-sophisticated moral about how being true to one’s self is a greater pleasure than all the money, luxury, and girls that charm can buy. “The Good Guy” forgets that it’s hard for a film to preach integrity when its script has none.

According to Danish director Henrik Genz, “We can’t get what we want. And we have to be happy with what we can get.” In his new film, “Terribly Happy,” Genz manifests these sentiments in a story that—unsurprisingly, given its title—is fairly dark. Earning comparisons to films by American directors David Lynch and the Coen Brothers, Genz’s “Terribly Happy” exemplifies the Americanization of European films, creating a balance between the strong character development native to Danish cinema and the more plot-driven stories of Hollywood.
“Terribly Happy” is based on a book by Erling Jepsen, a childhood friend of Genz. “He told me about his new idea for ‘Terribly Happy,’ and I immediately got captured. I thought it was a wonderful idea. He agreed on sending me every chapter he wrote, and I would comment on it while he was writing the book. Meanwhile, I was trying to figure out a treatment for the film as he developed the story.”
Through this collaboration, Genz and Jepsen developed an innovative plotline, composed of a patchwork of genres that complement each other well.
“When I met Erling, he told me he wanted to write a Danish Western novel. And of course, the story turns more into a drama, or noir, so at last it ended up kind of a mixture of different genres.”
The story of “Terribly Happy” is based on real life events from Jepsen’s life and childhood: “It’s really from an 11 year-old boy’s perspective. The dysfunctional family in our film has really existed. And I think it’s a good thing for people who had a trauma and a deep, deep secret that they can’t bear living with, to get that story told.”
With the resulting realistic, relatable plot and characters, Genz was able to develop several well-developed protagonists. “In the story, the most difficult thing was to get to the mid-point where our main characters could do something unforgiveable, but still not lose the audience.”
This emphasis on character development and the setting reflects Genz’s desire to craft a specifically Danish film. However, Genz’s focus on the plot represents a break from traditional Danish cinema. “I made it in Denmark for a Danish audience, and it’s made in a visceral language and a way of story-telling that we are not used to here,” Genz says. “In Denmark it was really a rather new style, a style forced by the story. The story demands the style, I think. So the form is rather new and fresh here.”
This new focus on plot-driven storytelling has led to an unexpected broadening of the film’s audience base across Europe and into the States. “I’m so surprised that American audiences and reviews have been that good. I was shocked that we came along with the little Danish film looking like something happening in the Midwest, talking in Danish and requiring subtitles. I thought this could only be a disaster. But I’m surprised and happy about the response we’ve gotten so far.”
According to Genz, “Terribly Happy” epitomizes the encroachment of American film tropes on European movies. “What has happened is that the Danish films are beginning to look much more like the films that come from the U.S. Therefore, each year, our film language becomes more and more similar to the way of telling the stories [in America], to get an audience to come to the cinemas. So, in fact, there’s a tendency in the ways of European filming to go towards the American way of telling stories.”
This apparent swapping of styles may prove useful in what could be Genz’s next film, a remake of “Terribly Happy” in English, set in the American Midwest. “There’s a lot of talk about a remake,” Genz says. “We have had some meetings, and I would say as long as I am in control of the story, and it’s not taken out of my hands and transformed into something I cannot agree on, then it could definitely be really exciting for me, trying to make a film in the States.”

If Bertolt Brecht and Steve Jobs collaborated on a play about economic downturn, the end result might look something like the lifeless, sluggish production of Clifford Odets’s “Paradise Lost” currently running at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.). Brecht would insist on calling attention to the show’s own theatricality, thereby distancing the audience and forcing them to separate their emotions from the action onstage in order to realize an important truth. Meanwhile, Jobs would persistently add more and more technology to the play, to no rational end. This is the feel of director Daniel Fish’s “Paradise Lost,” which runs through March 20: a muddled, pretentious mixture of inexplicable technology, estranging effects, and bizarre sermonizing that overshadows the fine actors and even the story itself.
Fish manages to remove any traces of life and energy from one of Odets’s best works, a tale about the survival of the human will in times of crisis. “Paradise” follows the Gordon family, who has lost their livelihood during economic decline. While originally set during the Great Depression, here the Gordons are re-envisioned as a contemporary family—one of Fish’s only directorial decisions that works, even if only in theory. Modernizing the Gordons and their neighbors would make their misfortune more relevant and immediate.
Yet any meaning Fish achieves with the present-day setting is negated by the baffling stark and technological aesthetic he forces on the show, which works against the script rather than with it. Videos projected onto a gigantic screen throughout the production are particularly off-putting. Even when the video works in a technical sense, it is distracting, unnecessary, and alienating. This is no fault of video designer Joshua Thorson, whose work is actually quite charming by itself. Rather, any video­—even as engaging as Thorson’s—simply makes no sense here, where it takes away from the onstage action and detracts from the play’s narrative.
The use of video is particularly unfortunate when three factory workers visit patriarch Leo Gordon (David Chandler) and his business partner Sam Katz (Jonathan Epstein) to complain about their conditions. The unseen workers lodge their complaints, speaking into off-stage microphones while the screen plays clips of silently talking everymen. The effect is sloppy and confusing. If Fish is trying to equate the three workers with modern employees and their struggles, he certainly does not succeed; it is barely discernable what is actually even happening in the scene.
This disorder carries through with the needless use of live feed video. Many of the instances utilizing live feed seem to be the consequence of ill-conceived staging, such as the conversation between Ben (Hale Appleman) and Kewpie (a moving Karl Bury) in which both actors are seated on the floor with their backs turned to the audience, with large furniture further blocking them from view.
As a result of the projections, and several odd moments during which characters speak into handheld microphones, the production comes off as cold, sterile, and preachy. The cavernous quality of the Loeb Mainstage only adds to this empty feeling. While the various scenic elements—designed by Andrew Lieberman—are visually striking throughout the three set changes, their scattered placement on the vast stage also underscores the emotional barrenness of the production.
Actors almost never connect or collaborate as they recite lines; instead, they always seem to be yelling across the stage at one another from atop these purposely unfinished set pieces. Their placement makes them feel even more removed from the audience. Consequently, emotional peaks in the script fall flat. Fish certainly seems more focused on his concept than the story itself.
Despite the mess around them, most of the actors still manage to deliver solid performances. Sally Wingert is natural and funny as matriarch Clara Gordon. Thomas Derrah as Gus Michaels and Epstein as Sam are both powerful and fiery. T. Ryder Smith shines above all as Julie, the younger of the Gordon sons, and Mr. May, a corrupt businessman who tries to enlist Leo.
Smith’s one scene as crooked Mr. May is the only instance of a rewarding use of video in the play. Finally, the video’s detached feel makes thematic sense when projecting May’s image—in negative—as he speaks. His black-and-white face effectively reflects both Smith’s doubled role and May’s unfeeling nature.
Unfortunately, this is one of the only successful moments of the production, which ends on a fittingly impassive note for a show that stresses electrical connections over personal ones. Leo Gordon’s final speech about his hope for the future of mankind should be a stirring conclusion, but his delivery into a microphone instead turns it into a lecture. While the Gordons are left with nothing but their own faith in man’s work,  Fish’s production leaves a far  less reassuring impression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For college students, issues of identity, origins, and the future are, admittedly, sensitive subjects. More importantly, however, they are pressing ones that ought to inspire open discourse about people’s backgrounds and their aspirations.
Such is the philosophy behind the 12th annual Dr. Walter J. Leonard Black Arts Festival, which brought Black Art to the forefront of Harvard’s campus from March 4 through 6. Presented by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the Black Arts Festival (BAF) focused on giving a voice to artists from Harvard and beyond, allowing them to reflect on the roots of their identities.
For many, this introspection was inspired by the idea of “Sankofa”—the theme of BAF this year. A Ghanaian word literally meaning, “go back and take,” this expression inspired artists from all walks of life to create works which reflected their cultural and personal background. Beyond that, “Sankofa” implies using one’s history as an impetus to make progress.
“You just don’t take history for granted... you move forward as it inspires you,” explains Henrietta A. O. Afari ’11, visual arts coordinator of the BAF board.
The festival invited various interpretations of what it means to look back and move forward. This year, BAF began with a panel discussion about Black Art featuring renowned poet and writer Amiri Baraka, one of the central figures in the Black Arts movement in Harlem during the 1960s. The panel also featured two perspectives from a younger generation—spoken word artist Joshua Bennett and scholar Cameron Leader-Picone, a fellow at Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute. In defining Black Art, Baraka spoke of his experiences growing up in a segregated society and took an explicitly political stance on what Black Art ought to do: “We create art because we want to change the world... we want to liberate the world, liberate the people.”
Bennett and Leader-Picone took more open stances regarding what qualifies as Black Art, noting that expressions of black identity can reveal a variety of different cultural and social experiences. However, the two made a point of honoring Baraka’s opinions and his contributions to the movement.
“I think I see Black Art changing as material circumstances change,” Bennett said. Then, addressing Baraka, Bennet said, “Your generation gave us that... and I think that’s a beautiful way Black Art encompasses a spectrum of the human experience we haven’t seen before.”
This spirit of openness was also present throughout the span of three days and accounts for the vast scope of art and artists involved. Apart from the panel with Baraka, the festival incorporated events drawing from almost every possible artistic discipline, including a film screening, multiple concerts, and a visual art gallery. The art exhibit, which will be located in the Holyoke Center arcade through the end of March, includes paintings, photography, and mixed-media pieces. According to Afari, this range of artistic forms emphasized the importance of the multi-disciplinary nature of the festival.
“It’s about giving students a voice in several aspects of the arts,” she said.
While these events and exhibits undoubtedly focus on bringing Black Art to Harvard’s campus, BAF makes a point of celebrating diversity. To that end, Afari pointed out that the festival seeks to serve as a unifying agent for an audience far beyond the black community at Harvard.
“Harvard is multicultural... even though we are all unique, we are not separate entities. That is what multiculturalism is for me, and if anything at all, that’s what BAF is trying to achieve,” Afari said.
In this spirit of engaging people from all backgrounds, the festival featured a casual open-mic session. Beyond simply hearing spoken-word performances, the audience participated in conversation with the artists themselves.
Another event, titled “Old Skool Meets New School,” consisted of a series of workshops in the arts for local high school students. These lessons are a part of BAF’s efforts to bring Black Art to a community larger than Harvard alone. For Afari, this inclusive spirit is one of the best aspects of BAF because “everyone can identify with it, no matter what culture.”
Ultimately, however, this year’s BAF emphasized the individual experience as its central theme. In the spirit of “Sankofa,” the art featured at the festival drew heavily upon artists’ personal narratives and how those experiences pointed them toward the future. Whether it was Baraka reminiscing about the racial politics of the 1960s, or student poets spitting verses about their aspirations, this year’s BAF brought personal histories to the forefront as a means of moving forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sanders Theatre was filled with rich, textured harmony last Friday evening during Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra’s (HRO) third concert of the 2009-2010 season. Under the baton of Federico Cortese, a senior lecturer in the music department, Harvard’s largest orchestra exemplified its virtuosity with its program of Chopin, Kirchner, and Brahms.
The first piece of the evening, Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E minor, featured the HRO concerto competition winner and internationally distinguished pianist Kenric Tam ’12. With the orchestra’s bold opening and the emergence of the lyrical second theme, beautifully introduced by flautist Irineo C. Cabreros ’13, Tam took to the stage with breathtaking expression. Though the orchestra’s complementation of his performance was not perfect at times, Tam displayed a uniquely sensitive and heart wrenching interpretation of Chopin’s first piano concerto. Especially striking during the second movement, Tam’s phrasing evoked a tender fragility that lingered in the theater even with the swell of the orchestra behind him. Tam’s artistry in no way overshadowed his technique during this notably difficult concerto—he presented strength and articulation in the intricate fast passages of the third movement until the concerto’s robust conclusion.
Cortese took a moment before the second piece, Music for Orchestra II, to commemorate its composer Leon Kirchner. Kirchner, who passed away last September, was a professor in the music department from 1961 to 1991 and conducted Harvard musicians and orchestras around the world. Though far removed from the romantic lyricism of Chopin’s Piano Concerto No.1, Music for Orchestra II was distinguished in its own right. The fiery piece united the strength of brass, percussion, and the raw chords of the strings, echoing the music of Stravinsky and Schoenberg. The piece was a worthy tribute to Kirchner, who Cortese said was “an extraordinary musician, filled with energy, enthusiasm, and a sense of humor and irony.”
The evening could have had no better finale than Johannes Brahms’ Symphony No. 3 in F major. Cortese skillfully guided the interplay of violins, cellos, French horn, and oboe through the thick harmonies of the first and second movements. The highlight of the evening’s performance was undoubtedly the third movement, with a hauntingly poignant melody that does not easily leave memory. Driven by the orchestra’s momentum, Cortese led the fourth movement to the evening’s positively triumphant conclusion.
The night of Chopin, Kirchner, and Brahms required musicians of high caliber. Not only did the student musicians demonstrate this necessary technical skill, they exemplified a maturity of interpretation far beyond their years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Metal arm bands are neatly arranged by a pipe bag underneath a looming five-foot portrait of its owner: Sitting Bull, the former Lakota Sioux holy war chief who famously led the Lakota and Cheyenne troops to victory in the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876. Nearby, old arrows are suspended in mid-air—as if shooting out from a propped bow—under an airbrushed banner depicting “thunderbirds,” mythological messengers of thunderstorms revered by Lakota members as spiritual sources for energy in battle.
Last April, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University opened an exhibit called “Wiyohpiyata,” Lakota for “west,” which alludes to the tribe’s idea that thunderstorms originate in the west; to the cultural belief that thunderstorms fuel warfare; and to bloody Western expansion. The center of gravity for the exhibit is a ledger inscribed with the work of several Lakota artists. The ledger—which has been in the possession of Harvard’s Houghton Library since the 1930s and was only discovered to be of artistic value five years ago—contains seventy-seven color drawings of Lakota war exploits, several of which are displayed alongside ancient artifacts and contemporary art pieces.
While each of these artifacts tells a story—in the case of one drawing, the tale of a Native American warrior who rescued his friend in combat—the exhibit itself is the product of an intricate interweaving of stories and cross-cultural negotiations. The product of a 30-year friendship between Peabody Museum Associate Curator of North American Ethnography Castle McLaughlin and Lakota tribe member Butch Thunder Hawk, the Wiyohpiyata exhibit explores the tribe’s culture and traditions with genuine Lakota perspective.
“Together we wanted to come up with the key Lakota concepts that would form the backbone of the exhibits and [decide] how to best express those concepts,” McLaughlin said.
SPIRIT IN EXHIBIT
While working on a reservation for blue roan horses—the decedents of original Lakota war ponies—in the 1980s, McLaughlin grew acquainted with Thunder Hawk, the tribal arts instructor at the United Tribe Technical College. The friendship between the two has served as the impetus for the current Wiyohpiyata exhibit, which they co-curated. Its planning required a large team of workers and over four years of conversations and brainstorming, according to Thunder Hawk.
“We wanted to design a Lakota-centric exhibit,” McLaughlin said, as she described the museum’s conscious effort to include a Native American in the process of producing the exhibit. “I was supposed to provide a non-[American] Indian perspective when necessary.”
To bridge the potential cultural divide, McLaughlin worked with Thunder Hawk to make the exhibit into a sensory experience that immerses the visitor in the sounds, images, and even smells associated with Lakota culture. “We thought about how people experience cultures,” McLaughlin says. “We decided that it had to be ambient and appeal to people’s senses—[to emphasize] not words and text but colors and shapes and sounds.”
Sounds of a thunderstorm fill the small L-shaped room. Out of sight, a scent machine pumps out the smell of white cedar. “We wanted to give the audience a sense of being in the element of a thunderstorm,” Thunder Hawk said.
The walls are alive with movement. Mounted video screens capture the undulation of the grass in a western plain, the nuzzling of two blue roan horses on a green hillside, and the neurotic twitching of a golden eagle’s head against a blue sky.
Underneath the video of the bird is a bonnet constructed of the feathers of a golden eagle. Pointing to the display, McLaughlin noted that the supernatural bond between creature and human creation empowered the Lakota warriors during battle. “Lakota think of warfare as unfolding as a storm—building in intensity,” McLaughlin says. “When that energy reached a certain pitch, [the warrior’s] amulets [representing this bond] would spring to life... opening the passage to the spirits.” Thunder Hawk agreed, noting that the Lakota people draw on these spirits to help them in both the rage of war and quotidian life.
Thunder Hawk’s own work adorns the gallery, including an effigy honoring the death of a blue roan horse that appears over fifteen times in the images inside the ledger. According to him, such effigies were created by Lakota warriors who lost their horses in battle, and these objects were later used in ceremonial dances. For Thunder Hawk, who learned his artistic skills from his grandparents, the exhibit was an inspiration; it exposed him to the art of the pictograph—the colored illustrations that fill the ancient ledger.
CROSS-CULTURAL CONVERSATIONS
The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology houses more than six million cultural objects and 500,000 photographic records, constituting one of the oldest and largest collections of indigenous artifacts in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred of the objects are on display in the permanent exhibit, called “The Hall of the North American Indian,” which was installed in 1990 and continues to be a home for academic research, along with educational and ceremonial programs. McLaughlin says that she carefully selected the artifacts for the Wiyohpiyata exhibit from among the museum’s vast collection of Native American pieces.
Founded in 1867, the Peabody Museum boasts a uniquely comprehensive array of cultural objects. Throughout its existence, the museum has seen dramatic changes in the relationship between museums seeking indigenous artifacts and Native Americans. The Peabody has not only been an influential player in the development of modern conceptions of Native American artifacts, but also an exemplary producer of the shifts in the relationship.
In 1990, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) required that federally-funded institutions like the Peabody initiate dialogues with federally recognized tribes about the artifacts in museums. The Peabody’s collection of Native American artifacts is one of the largest in the nation subject to NAGPRA’s regulations, according to Repatriation Coordinator Patricia A. Capone, who is an associate curator at the Peabody and an anthropology lecturer. Capone describes NAGPRA as a catalyst for productive discussion between tribes and museums.
For example, the Peabody’s recent Archeology of Harvard Yard Exhibit drew together students, administrators, and tribal leaders in an effort to promote a concerted dialogue about the artifacts and their presentations in the museum, according to Capone.
The Peabody and the tribes can forge strong relationships when tribes exercise their rights as outlined in the act. For example, the federally-recognized Cape Fox Corporation—which legally represents various Alaskan Native American tribes—deemed one totem pole in the Peabody collection an object of cultural patrimony. The totem pole, which told a story of the Alaskan bear clan, was repatriated in 2001.
But the conversations between the Peabody and the relevant tribes are not always defined by peaceful unanimity. “There are times that not everyone agrees,” Capone says.
“However, among these Alaskan tribes, reciprocity is highly practiced,” Capone says. The tribe that reclaimed the totem pole gave the museum a cedar tree, and the museum in turn commissioned Nathan Jackson, an artist from that community, to carve the tree into a different totem pole.
The new totem pole tells the same story of the repatriated art piece: the story of the Fox, the Hunter, and the Brown Bear. The new pole is a recent creation and thus bolsters the museum’s collection of contemporary Native American art—a collection which grew during the Peabody’s recent REMIX exhibit, which explored indigenous identity in the 21st century.
REMAINING IN FOCUS
The REMIX exhibit was the result of a collaboration of Native American students and Peabody administrators looking to express the modern-day identity of Native American culture. Two pieces from the exhibit still remain in the gallery. One, a painting done by Bunky Echo-Hawk, replaced a 16th century photograph of a Native American that once hung outside of the “Change and Continuity” exhibit, according to Kelsey T. Leonard ’10, co-curator of the original REMIX exhibit and a member of Native Americans at Harvard College (NAHC). Leonard also noted the importance of including contemporary art in an exhibit about the continuity of the Native American culture.
The other piece that remains is a mural by Native American graphic artist Ryan Red Corn. The piece, entitled “Vandalism,” depicts Mount Rushmore, a sacred site for the Lakota tribe. The Lakota people held the land by treaty when the U.S. decided to carve Mount Rushmore into a sculpture of four American presidents.
As Red Corn worked on this piece symbolizing the disregard for the Lakota people’s treaty, a young boy walking by asked his father if Native Americans still exist. Red Corn listened as the father told his son “no,” according to Leonard. This anecdote is just one example of the “invisibility that is often felt by native youths,” Leonard said.
“We embrace our past and we embrace our present,” she added. “But we are looking towards our future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, Californians bore witness to dozens of protests across cities and universities in The Golden State. These protests were part of a national day of action that was organized by groups advocating for the protection of education from injurious budget cuts. In California, the protests were especially justified; to make up for a state-wide deficit of over $20 billion, the public universities in California have sought to trim their own budgets by reducing library hours, furloughing staff, cutting teaching assistants—and, most dramatically, increasing tuition by 32 percent.
We support the aims of these campaigns—convincing legislators who are setting state-wide budgets to allot more money for education. Diverging from past protests that included tactics such as storming classrooms and occupying academic buildings, the latest round of action in California instead involved groups of protestors storming highways, causing traffic to shut down. The smart shift in focus from targeting university administrators to directing frustration at budget-setting lawmakers will ideally bring about change as quickly as possible.
Much criticism has been directed at students for having taken to the streets rather than staying in the classroom where, so it is said, a student who really cared about education would be. The academic sacrifices suffered to support these campaigns for the protection of higher education are indeed real, and students across the UC system remark they are suffering from "protest fatigue."
However, the long-term consequences if these campaigns fail to stop tuition hikes and the failure of the UC system to achieve its educational purpose will greatly outweigh any short-term fatigue. Mark Yudof, president of the University of California, has said that departure of faculty members is his biggest fear in the UC system’s current crisis. Yet the proposed tuition hike threatens to exclude huge numbers of students from the world-class education promised to them by the California Master Plan, drawn up 50 years ago to ensure affordable access to education. If classes are cancelled now as a result of protests, it is with the understanding that the failure of these campaigns could mean the total loss of a college education for many more students. Given the number of UC students who pay their way through school by taking on jobs and loans, in addition to the considerable financial sacrifices endured by many families, the rise in tuition literally means the difference between getting or not getting a degree.
The protests aim to stop the erosion of one of the pillars of accessible, public university education—affordability. Non-violent protests against this unfortunate reality—as all the protests have promised to be—are thus completely justified. As such, we support the protestors’ expansive, multi-dimensional approach and hope that the students, staff, faculty, and administrators of the UC schools will begin seeing their demands for the continued safety and strength of the public university system met.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s no secret that the typical Harvard student is a perfectionist; they study the extra hour, take the extra practice exam, and read the next chapter. Perfectionism extends to Friday nights, as it turns out: This freshman class is more likely to take the next shot of alcohol than ever before, and more Harvard students are identifying themselves as heavy drinkers. According to data released by the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, there was a 43 percent increase in students requesting alcohol-related treatment from University Health Services over the last two years. Additionally, 42 percent of freshmen this year are more likely to "pregame," and 39 percent of freshmen take shots, two behaviors that can lead to over-consumption of alcohol.
Although there is only speculation on the causes of the increase in hospitalizations and drinking behavior, Harvard’s attitude toward alcohol leads to unsafe drinking habits for undergraduates. Often, students feel the need to consume large amounts of alcohol quickly at pregames before going out, as the availability of alcohol at events on campus is scarce. The College maintains a strict policy of prohibiting those under 21 from drinking at parties in upperclass houses. In response, students often flock to unsafe and unmonitored locations to drink, such as final clubs. Instead of acting as though underage drinking does not occur, the College should do its best to foster safe drinking environments for its students.
While Harvard’s policies might not be conducive for safe drinking behavior, the school has indeed created mediums to educate students on safe drinking habits. In 2006, the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors program, known as DAPA, was founded with the intention of educating students on safe drinking behavior. While this program was a good step for student safety, Harvard should push for alcohol education on more fronts. Specifically, the College should allow and encourage the plethora of upperclassmen advisors on campus to have an explicit conversation with their advisees about alcohol. These upperclassmen—including Peer Advising Fellows, Freshmen Outdoor Program leaders, Freshmen Urban Program leaders, and student-group comp directors, to name a few—have a close and influential relationship with freshmen, and can model moderate drinking habits, answer difficult questions, and make safe behavior the norm. All of these leaders should be encouraged to remain at parties if they notice advisees drinking there, to help freshmen as best they can.
Alcohol education at Harvard seems to be working to some degree, and the increase in hospitalizations might suggest that students are becoming more conscientious about the health of their peers, and are therefore utilizing UHS services more frequently. This attitude would not be possible without Harvard’s amnesty policy regarding alcohol. Found in the student handbook, the amnesty policy states that any student brought into UHS for alcohol-related illness, along with any students assisting them, will not receive disciplinary action. Because of this, students are less likely to fear punishment, which minimizes alcohol-related injury and death. Thus, Harvard’s amnesty policy deserves praise.
However, while this amnesty policy is effective, the OADS should conduct more research focused on students who repeatedly find themselves in Stillman Infirmary, in order to identify trends and help remedy those situations as best it can.
Ultimately, although Harvard can monitor student-drinking behavior to some degree, the amount each person decides to consume is a choice that lies solely with the individual. The increase in hospitalizations should be a wake up call for students, as well—and encourage undergraduates to take responsibility for any unsafe alcohol choices they decide to make.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"The burqa confiscates a woman’s existence. By and large, those who wear it are victims," said Fadela Amara, France’s Secretary of Urban Policy, and a Muslim woman herself. This is the going attitude toward the Islamic veil in France these days. Since 2004, French girls have been banned from wearing headscarves in state schools, and in January of this year, a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on women wearing Islamic face veils in government offices, schools, on public transportation, and in hospitals. Such a ban would be discriminatory toward Muslim culture, and the implications of its reasoning would be far-reaching and undemocratic. Currently in drafting, the bill that would enact these changes should not be passed.
It is true that certain forms of the Islamic veil, such as the burqua, physically limit a woman’s existence. It would be much harder to play soccer, go shopping or do other vigorous activities when so covered. In a society where the superficial changes brought by the feminist revolution are highly resonant—fifties women were hemmed in by those tight circle skirts, but now we can all wear pantsuits!—the burqua can seem inherently opposed to "girl power."
However, even if one takes the view that all veils are physically limiting in some way—and there are highly popular types of Islamic veils that seem to limit nothing but shaking your hair in the wind—who is Amara, or anyone else to say that these women are limiting themselves because of oppression and are thus "victims"? Women all over the world change their appearance in ways to reflect the opinions of other people, whether they be men, other women, or their families, and we certainly don’t see all these other forms of shape-shifting as rooted in oppression. High heels are awfully painful, and in a gender-neutral world I probably wouldn’t wear them that often. But I do choose to confine my existence as such from time to time, and it’s for myself as much as for my formal date.
For that matter, will other sartorial forms of person-to-person obligations that could be termed "submissions," such as wedding rings, ugly jewelry made by your children, and uncomfortable business suits, be targeted next? Wearing such devotional symbols is an indication of the happiness of your life, not the unhappiness. No one can say that a woman is being unwillingly forced to take on a certain appearance except the woman herself, and to assume otherwise in the case of a certain culture is wrong.
But the commission was not only worried about women’s rights when they proposed the veil-ban, they were also worried about the growth of Islamic radicalism within France. The same parliamentary commission recommended that foreign women exhibiting such signs of "radicalness" (presumably, like a veil) be denied residency, asylum, and citizenship. France has five million Muslims, more than any other country in Western Europe, and has had problems assimilating immigrants in the past. Therefore, fears of a London subway bombings-style act of violence by disenchanted Muslim youth are resonant Again, there is some truth to the idea that that veils often mark out some—although by no means all—Muslims who feel especially strongly about their faith. But just like it is unfair to assume that a veiled woman is oppressed, it is unfair to assume that a religious woman is a radical. In the 2004 law governing religious symbols in state schools, in addition to veils France banned large Christian crosses, Sikh turbans and Jewish yarmulkes. Yet none of these symbols are being considered dangerous indicators of radicalization.
Right or not, France’s actions against veils have set the tone for the rest of Europe. Now, Austria, Denmark, and the Netherlands are also considering banning the veil. But this is not the solution to acrimony between religions, or the problems of integrating immigrant Muslims into European cultures. Rather, European countries must expand their conceptions of liberalism to include aspects of Muslim culture—and that includes the veil.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"Running from place to place" is not just catchphrase for Harvard students. Rather, it serves as their modus operandi, or so we are told. With this month’s Harvard magazine feature, "Non-Stop," the myth of the Harvard student—the over-committed, over-caffeinated robot, mechanically churning out assignment after assignment, frantically darting from one scheduled activity to the next, and perpetually teetering on the verge of physical exhaustion—is at large.
Here, Deputy Editor Craig Lambert diagnoses the pathology of modern undergraduates, who "routinely sprint through jam-packed daily schedules" and submerge themselves in a "frenetic tizzy of commitments," checking their "Crackberries" when they pause to come up for air. Gone are the days of searching self-reflection and shooting the breeze with friends; students these days just don’t have the time. As Lambert opines, Harvard undergraduates are not simply busy; they are intensely fearful of not being busy. In the undergraduate lexicon, boredom doubles as a swear word; we suffer from a "horror vacui"—a phobia of leisure time that precludes us from loitering, daydreaming, and meandering through the Square.
In an effort to illustrate the extent of Harvard’s hysterically paced culture, Lambert profiles Rebecca A. Cooper ’10. Far from censorious, Lambert’s description amounts to a 500-odd word celebration of Cooper’s CV, which glorifies the very mindset it ostensibly intends to critique. Reducing Cooper to an itemized list of "productive" activities, Lambert reinforces the myopic, resume-building mentality that provokes many Harvard students to overextend themselves in the first place. Through Cooper’s account of late nights spent in Lamont, his article ennobles ascetic suffering in the name of academic success—what could be more beautiful, after all, than watching the sunrise in a fluorescently-lit cubicle? When defined in toto by a set of quantified accomplishments, as in Lambert’s article, Cooper becomes her resume, her self-worth determined by the number of semi-colons her activities can command.
Admittedly, there is some truth to Lambert’s observations: At times, every Harvard student is busy, stressed, sleep-deprived, or an amalgam of the three. Many undergraduates do undertake a dizzying plethora of commitments; others harbor acute anxieties about unstructured time, as evidenced by debates over the lack of J-term programming. Rebutting Lambert’s assessment without subscribing to the same dubious strategy of generalizing from anecdotes proves difficult, if not impossible—in the end, no commentator can channel the undergraduate unconscious. Yet, regardless of the veracity of his conclusions, by drawing what he deems the prototypical "Harvard student" into discourse, Lambert entrenches the very stereotypes which he seeks to probe. Equal parts descriptive and productive, Lambert’s critique becomes aspirational.
Its empirical validity notwithstanding, the myth of the Harvard student—epitomized by Lambert’s subtitle, "Cradle to Goldman Sachs"—possesses an inherent regulatory power. The student who takes five classes, founds two clubs, and snatches a competitive summer internship becomes the model for post-college success—the ideal that all undergraduates must approximate if they hope to end up elsewhere than their parents’ couch. By reiterating the stereotype in painstaking detail, Lambert inadvertently expands its ideological hold: We are meant—whether consciously or not—to stack our achievements next to Cooper’s and see how they compare. The stereotype, therein, becomes both self-perpetuating and self-fulfilling.
Evidence suggests that this phenomenon of the student-cum-superhero has a gendered bent. While Harvard’s male-to-female ratio weighs marginally in women’s favor, the gender gap in higher education widens on the national scale: According to the American Council on Education, 57 percent of bachelor’s recipients this year will be female. An article in The New York Times, published in 2007, describes the rise of "amazing girls:" young women who exhaust themselves emulating the paradigm of the straight-A student who is simultaneously thin, pretty, and stylish. The author attributes this trend—situated within a distinctly white, upper-middle class milieu—to the consolidation of feminist gains: As she asserts, "if you are free to be everything, you are also expected to be everything."
Unobtainable demands for female perfection are not news: The ideal of the poreless, cellulite-free, and endlessly docile female body retains its resonance, even though, as skeptics opine, "feminism is dead." This stereotype, however, is inherently asymptotic: no matter how earnestly one tries, its realization perpetually eludes, then leaves one feeling inadequate for failing to make the grade. The same holds true of Lambert’s "Harvard student." Generically classed and superhumanly scheduled, this figure seems to possess no tangible weight—yet, its existence, whether real or theoretical, still makes us feel anxious for not measuring up.
Pressured to instrumentalize their educations for the sake of some bigger, better goal, Harvard students come to instrumentalize themselves, deflating holistic personalities into commoditized brands that can be bought or rejected. By replaying—and implicitly glorifying—the stereotype of the Ivy League overachiever, Lambert’s diagnosis helps produce the mentality that it superficially critiques, rehashing the religious notion that those who suffer—those malnourished undergraduates still typing in the library come daybreak—are the most worthy.
I, for one, would rather be sleeping.

Maya E. Shwayder ’10-’11, a Crimson editorial writer, is a psychology concentrator in Pforzheimer House.
I can claim no political expertise. I have no knowledge of the inner workings of Washington, the particulars of punditry, or the logistics of legislation. However, as a voter and as a woman with some experience in the professional world, I would like to say this; if Scott Brown had been female, he never would have been elected.
Had he run the exact same campaign, had he faced the exact same opponent, and had the exact same nude Cosmopolitan Magazine centerfold spread come to light, his (or rather, her, in this hypothetical) campaign would have died right then and there. She would have been forced out of her current job and lost whatever credibility she had left, along with any hopes of running for future office or holding a high-profile job. There would have been accusations of prostitution, name-calling, innuendos, claims of foul play, and conspiracy theories galore. Why? Because Scott Brown needed to pay for law school, and she posed nude for Cosmo in order to do so.
During the campaign, no one really discussed the spread or its implications. No one seemed to think it a problem that the Republican candidate to succeed the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-‘56 was a one-time playboy. The only person who came close to a criticism was Keith Olbermann, who, in his emphatic over-slur of Brown, declared him to be an "irresponsible, homophobic, racist, reactionary, ex-nude model." Everyone else who mentioned the episode would quickly qualify the phrase, "he posed nude," with the statement, "to pay for law school!"
The answer to why was it not discussed further is obvious: It didn’t matter, nor should it. Senator Brown’s ability to make nice for the camera bears little on his ability to make policy. However, when the story first came to light, I couldn’t help recall Lisa Edelstein’s character Laurie from the hit TV show The West Wing, who was also trying to pay her way through law school by working as an escort. The point Aaron Sorkin, the show’s creator and main writer, was making with this plotline was that Laurie’s chosen method of financing her education had little to do with her intelligence or abilities as a lawyer. But when a White House staffer was caught with her, it almost detonated both his career and fictional President Bartlet’s.
Many stories like Laurie’s are unfortunately not at all fictional. In 2003, The Guardian published a story about a mother who prostituted herself in order to pay for her daughter’s schooling, as well as several other women in similar situations. In 2006, the London Times reported that an estimated one in ten students attending a university knew someone who had at some point "stripped, lapdanced or worked at massage parlours and escort agencies to support themselves." In 2008, ABC reported a rise in the rates of prostitution and drug trafficking among school children in Papua New Guinea in order to "pay school fees." And last July, CBS’s Katie Couric told the stories of several college-attending American girls forced to turn to prostitution when economic circumstances ran their families into bankruptcy.
Seemingly, little is being done to help these women financially so that they can stop being prostitutes. In fact, many have simply ended up in jail. The usual response to these stories is to turn up one’s morally superior nose and say that "there must have been another way to find the money." But all that these women were trying to do, just like Senator Brown, was pay for school. They want to be productive members of society. Many of those trying to attend law school would probably love to run for public office some day. But if and when their past came to light, rest assured that these women would be laughed out of the statehouse, out of the courthouse, off the campaign trail, and off the Bar. However, if you are Scott Brown, posing nude to pay for law school is no impediment to being elected to succeed Senator Kennedy with no questions asked.
The Brown phenomenon has brought to light more than just the supposed Republican re-takeover of our national government. Brown’s ascension to the Senate in spite of his turn as a centerfold is an indication of our culture’s severe double standard in terms of the treatment of men and women. One can’t help but recall the ridicule former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin underwent for being, among other things, a former beauty queen. When a girl can pay for her education without having to prostitute herself, and when a woman can run for a prominent public office without facing the harsh criticism that Scott Brown didn’t face, that will be the day that we are finally on the track to true equality and justice for all people, no matter their gender.

Forty placards, each bearing the words “I am a feminist because,” hung beside corresponding photographs of self-identified feminist students and professors in an exhibit that opened last night in the Adams Arts Space.
The Feminist Portrait Project, co-sponsored by the Radcliffe Union of Students and the Harvard Queer Students and Allies, features notable Harvard personalities including Law School Professor Alan M. Dershowitz and History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93.
The exhibit is one component of Harvard’s first annual Feminist Coming Out Day.
The statements of the individuals highlighted in the exhibit displayed a diverse understanding of feminism. Dershowitz wrote that gender equality has always been self-evident to him, and McCarthy wrote that he believes in the “radical” notion that women are full, free, and equal human beings. Gregory B. Johnston ’13 wrote that the world cannot afford to lose half its brilliant minds so the other half can feel more powerful. Shani Boianjiu ’11, co-president of RUS, wrote that feminism is the new “it” girl.
“Feminism is becoming a lot more visible on campus—look at these people from all different walks of life who have come out as feminists for this exhibit,” said Boianjiu, who added that she hopes the various notions of feminism expressed will increase discussion and awareness of feminist issues. “The exhibit gave RUS a chance to reach out to the amazing diversity of people at Harvard and learn how those people perceive the things we’re passionate about.”
Abby P. Sun ’13, co-president of RUS, said that the range of ideas expressed is inspiring and thought-provoking for people who may not have thought of themselves as feminists in the past.
“Feminism is a lifelong pursuit of justice, and a lot of it has to do with spreading awareness,” Sun said, adding that the exhibit is a wonderful way to bring a wide spectrum of feminist ideas into public view. ”One of the goals of this exhibit is to make feminism a label people are proud of.”
QSA Women’s Events and Outreach Chair Lena Chen ’09-’10, an organizer of the exhibit, invited the fifty or more attendees admiring the photographs to join the people pictured on the wall in coming out as feminists. Polaroid camera in hand, she snapped pictures of the attendees and taped the snapshots to the wall.
“A lot of people on campus may never have realized they were feminists without this exhibit,” Chen said. “Feminism is not something that’s just important to women—a lot of people can relate to it.”
She passed the camera to a friend and posed with a fellow QSA member for a picture. “Feminism is for everyone!” she smiled.

American black men in post 9/11 popular culture are being portrayed as “heroic terror warriors,” according to Boston College professor Cynthia Young, who discussed her research at a talk with students and professors in Robinson Hall yesterday afternoon.
The discussion—which centered around a draft of one of Young’s papers titled “Black Ops and Sleeper Cells: Race, the War on Terror and Popular Culture from Above and Below”—explored how rap music and television shows such as “The Unit” and “Sleeper Cells” manifest changing popular conceptions of blackness and how the media can influence such race issues.
“The Unit” is a popular American TV-show that depicts the work of Delta Force—an elite, ultra-secret special forces unit—that ran on CBS until May 2009.
“Sleeper Cells” is an Emmy-nominated Showtime miniseries that tells the story of so-called sleeper cells, terrorist units that live like ordinary individuals until told to launch a pre-planned attack.
Young, an associate professor and director of the African and African Diaspora Studies Program at BC, said she is interested in “how the Civil Rights legacy is being understood and reframed after 9/11” and why the Bush administration chose to link the “overcoming of black oppression” with the “so-called war with freedom and democracy.”
Young has previously written on the Civil Rights Movement and is currently working on a book project called “Afterburn: Race and Culture After 9/11.”
The paper presented yesterday will be part of this project, which she says will hopefully eventually contain five chapters.
In addition to studying media and popular culture, Young said she also hopes to look at immigration in America and the backlash against Latino immigrants from black groups.
She also said that she would like to examine how Muslims are being portrayed in post 9/11 American society and how they have been affected by accusations of terrorist activity.
In the aftermath of 9/11, Muslim-Americans faced widespread suspicion as the attacks launched by the terrorist group Al-Qaeda were seen as representative of Islam.
Young also took comments on her paper from professors and graduate students.
She said she was “hoping to reach an audience outside of universities” and aiming to write “in a way that was traditionally less academic.”
Audience members suggested she contact more black war veterans, explore popular reaction to the television shows and music discussed in her paper, and  also that she address the domestic implications that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have had on African American soldiers.

Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Y. Suk is helping Sen. Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.) design a new standard that would protect fashion designers against knockoffs.
Suk, who co-authored an article published in the Stanford Law Review advocating copyright laws for fashion designers, is now advising Schumer in his efforts to draft legislation expanding the reach of federal copyright laws to protect fashion.
“Fashion is an area of culture that is everywhere around us,” Suk said in an interview yesterday. “It is an area where there is a constant outpouring of creativity.”
Fashion is currently unprotected by federal law, as it falls under the category of “useful articles,” which, like furniture, are excluded from copyright protection in spite of any artistic value.
Copyright protection, Suk argues, would benefit emerging fashion designers with limited budgets, as they are often unable to compete with knockoffs that purveyors like Forever 21 advertise at significantly reduced prices.
Heba el Habashy ’10­—who recently launched TheCultivate.com, a Web-based service which aims to connect new designers with trend-conscious wholesalers and buyers to bolster local markets—expressed her support for protecting fledgling designers.
“I can get over people copying the work of established fashion houses,” Habashy wrote in an e-mail. “But emerging designers are barely scraping by, and to have the tenacity to cut them out of this competitive retail market is just wrong.”
But even prominent fashion designers such as the late Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, who are able to file lawsuits against companies for copying their designs, run into difficulties because there are no current legal standards in place.
Because fashion designs tend to follow existing trends, Suk said that the “substantially similar” copyright standards for film, music, and literature, cannot be applied to fashion designs.
Fashion designs, Suk said, can be “substantially similar”—just not “substantially identical.”

For many seniors, this week has been circled on their calendars for months. While the rest of campus is counting down the days until Spring Break and drudging through the last round of midterms and papers, about half of the senior class is preparing to hand in a senior thesis.
In addition to gallons of coffee, thesis-writing seniors said the most helpful opportunities that Harvard had provided them as they worked to complete this year-long endeavor were the chance to do on-the-ground research and the extra time to focus on their projects during the new January Term.
Through Harvard grants, many students use their thesis as a way of traveling and studying abroad. While exploring underground archives or interviewing the local populations in the Chinese countryside, Harvard students get a University-subsized glimpse of life outside of Cambridge.
For Weiqi Zhang ’10, who is writing a thesis in Social Studies, his time abroad this summer convinced him to alter the focus of his thesis. Zhang, an inactive Crimson news editor, had originally planned to focus on the Nu River Dam in southwest China and locals’ concerns about the dam’s construction.
But after arriving in the country and beginning his research, he decided he would rather focus on the environmental activists’ worries about how the dam would affect the surrounding area.
Zhang said that the in-person research he conducted helped him realize what truly interested him.
The new January Term break gave this year’s seniors the opportunity to focus on their theses without the distraction of classes and extracurriculars.
“It was nice to have a period of time where it was all you had to think about” said Sarah R. Burack ’10, a History concentrator writing a thesis about a race riot in London.
With the end in sight, all seniors interviewed said they look back on the thesis writing process favorably.
“It’s a nice way to wrap up your studies and put everything you’ve studied together,” Zhang said.
When asked if the end result will be worth all the time and effort she has put into the project, Reyzl R. Geselowitz ’10, a Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations concentrator writing her thesis on the role of women in ancient Israel, had two separate answers.
“If you ask me on Friday at 5:01 p.m., I would say, ‘Yes,’ unconditionally. I’m glad I had the experience, but right now I’m a little bit frazzled and sleep deprived.”
After completing the largest endeavor of their academic careers, seniors will certainly be celebrating this weekend.
“I’m planning a massive pub crawl through the Square,” Burack said. “Then I’m going to Costa Rica and not bringing my laptop or a single book.”

Kirkland House will retain one floor of 20 DeWolfe St. after efforts to offload all overflow housing in the apartment building have resulted in a compromise.
Contrary to earlier indications that Kirkland would cease housing students in the building altogether, Joshua G. McIntosh, associate dean of Harvard College for student life, confirmed in an e-mailed statement yesterday that Lowell House will take one floor of housing in 20 DeWolfe St. and that Kirkland will keep one of its two current floors.
This announcement came three days before freshmen will receive their housing assignments and after more than four years of yearning on the part of the Kirkland House Masters to rid the House of the overflow housing, which is located three blocks away from Kirkland proper.
None of the other Houses that currently occupy 10 and 20 DeWolfe St. will shift or be displaced, wrote McIntosh, who mediated the discussion over which Houses would occupy DeWolfe.
Lowell House resident tutor Van C. Tran said last week that he thought that Kirkland would be keeping one floor in the building, saying that Lowell only agreed to take on a floor after considering the “shared sense of responsibility” of devoting House resources to students.
Opinions regarding DeWolfe vary across the Kirkland community. Kirkland House Master Tom C. Conley said that students’ satisfaction scores on the House life surveys have suggested that residents prefer to live in Kirkland proper as opposed to DeWolfe, but Kirkland House Committee Co-Chair Kelly N. Bodwin ’11 said that some are sad to lose rooms known for their spacious interiors and in-room kitchens.

An e-mail from a concerned mother alleging that Central Square is “overrun with drunks, drugs, drug deals and scum” dominated the discussion at last night’s Cambridge City Council meeting, as council members discussed potential changes to the infrastructure of the neighborhood.
Though Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 said that the e-mail might simply be a “suburban overreaction to the diversity of Central Square,” he proposed that the city could benefit from an official assessment of the area.
“Central Square is, for many people both in and out of Cambridge, a central point of interaction within the City, owing to the many transportation lines that run through the square,” Reeves said. “There is erosion, and we have to address it.”
Reeves said that he hopes that the city will open a discussion on living conditions in Central Square, which has not seen a large-scale renovation since 1990 when the city spent around $3.5 million to revitalize the neighborhood.
Just last month, the Boston Consulting Group released a report on the state of Kendall Square, Reeves said.
Central Square’s most pressing problems range from a high poverty level to insufficient police presence to “move along various nefarious activities on and around the benches,” Reeves said.
Other council members at the meeting agreed that the city needs to address the problems in Central Square.
“It looks quite messy and even threatening,” Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis said. “We need to take more aggressive steps. We need to advocate for the citizens.”
Former Mayor E. Denise Simmons added that the City Council currently does not have a specific economic plan to develop Central Square.
“What I’m going to be looking for is some sort of aggressive plan to make sure that Central Square is the center of the Cambridge, which its name implies,” Simmons said.
Other topics discussed at the meeting included the dedication of a suitable location in the vicinity of Callendar Street in honor of Mrs. Mildred E. Best, the availability of public meeting space at Cambridge Main Library and other library related issues,  a possible meeting of various stakeholders in the Central Square community for the purpose of discussing and reviewing current action plans for Central Square, an evaluation of Grozier Road, which has a number of road defects, for resurfacing and repair, and a request that the Massachusetts Legislature ot conduct an independent cost-benefit analysis of Level III gambling in Massachusetts.

Mick Dodson, a law professor and director of the Australian National University’s National Centre for Indigenous Studies, has been appointed the next chair of Harvard’s Committee on Australian Studies.
Dodson, who currently lives and works in Canberra, Australia, plans to work with the Kennedy School of Government’s Project on American Indian Economic Development as well, according to David Haig, the current chair of the committee and a professor of organismic and evolutionary biology.
“Dodson has a great deal of experience in indigenous land rights, negotiation in Australia, and in the economic development problems of Australian indigenous populations,” Haig said. “There will be a discussion of the parallel experiences of populations in the United States and Australia, two countries with somewhat similar indigenous histories.”
Dodson, who could not be reached for comment yesterday, will share the rotating committee chair position next year with Chris McAuliffe, Director of the Ian Potter Museum of Art at the University of Melbourne, according to a press release from the Australian National University.
Dodson has been a lifelong proponent of indigenous rights around the world. He was named the 2009 Australian of the Year by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who thanked Dodson for his dedication to the Aboriginal people.
“His efforts truly show that if we work together, we can achieve real progress,” Rudd said upon presenting the award.
Dodson recently helped draft the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which advocates for indigenous human rights and was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007.
Dodson told the Australian Associated Press that he plans to examine why Native Americans have a longer life expectancy than Australian Aboriginals during his time at Harvard.
“It will also be a good opportunity to find out more about some of the work being done in the US that I can bring back to Australia,” Dodson said in the ANU press release. “Indigenous peoples from around the world have much to gain from sharing knowledge about their individual efforts to win full rights and recognition.”
Dodson will continue to hold his directorship at the Australian National University while he assumes the chair position at Harvard.

Like peanut butter and jelly, spaghetti and meatballs, or a Tuesday night and HUDS’ latest squash concoction, the sport of sailing goes together with clear skies and sunny weather.
So along with the return of milder temperatures and a spring climate this past weekend, so too came the opening of the 2010 spring season for the Harvard sailing team.
The beginning of the spring campaign was marked by just one regatta this weekend, the Sharpe Trophy Team Race at MIT, which is a light schedule compared to the two, three, and four regattas the Crimson will compete in over the next three weekends respectively.
“Our first real day together as a team was this past Thursday,” sophomore skipper Brendan Kopp said, “So we were only able to get one or two practices in before our first regatta this weekend.  Our main goal was to just get out on the water and to rotate as many people as possible into the boats.”
With these rather reserved goals in mind, Harvard was nonetheless able to post a third-place team finish among the six squads competing over the two-day affair on the Charles.
The Crimson co-eds posted an 11-7 record overall, with a 9-6 mark coming in the three round robins against the rest of the six-team field.
Harvard’s 9-6 record matched Tufts and Brown for the best mark in the round robin portion of the regatta, but the Jumbos and Bears were able to move on to the championship round because each took two of their three races against the Crimson.
In its final round of competition on Sunday, Harvard beat Boston College in two of their three matchups, securing third place for the Crimson, as Tufts came away from the regatta as the team champion.
“We were pleased with out results,” rookie crew Alma Lafler said, who was competing in her first top-tier competition as a member of the Harvard sailing team.
“The wind picked up over the course of day one, which was good, and there was a lot of wind throughout day two, which was nice because we were able to finish all of the races we started.  The sun also made our races much more enjoyable.  It was weather I didn’t expect so soon in the season.”
Four duos graced the water over the course of the weekend for the Crimson, as juniors Teddy Himler and Quincy Bock teamed up as a skipper-crew combo, while junior skipper Alan Palmer and Lafler made a team.
Also, junior John Stokes skippered alongside senior crew Michelle Konstadt, and Kopp rounded out the pairings with third-year crew Meghan Wareham.
“Everyone’s boat handling is going to be a little rusty after taking time off,” Kopp said.
The Harvard team was only able to lift weights while on campus over the past few months.
Some individual members were forced to sail on their own while they were away from Cambridge.
“Some of us are new to team race sailing, and the team has been very patient in helping everyone get used to the format,” Kopp said.
The newcomer Lafler also noted how the team was supportive in helping its less experienced members get accustomed to the Crimson squad.
“The communication between boats is only go to improve as the season progresses,” the freshman said.
Harvard will be able to improve on its communication and fix any weaknesses with new team experiences during its spring break trip to Maryland next week.
“We are going to be able to practice in Maryland with the teams from St. Mary’s and Yale, so that should help us improve as a team, and we will hopefully be able to try team and fleet style racing down there, which should help us gain experience” Kopp said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday afternoon, the Crimson women’s tennis team sweltered beneath the warm Tampa sun in a losing effort against No. 20 South Florida (7-4). With the 5-2 defeat, No. 60 Harvard (6-5) ended its only trip to Florida this season with an even record after winning against Central Florida on Saturday.
“Unfortunately today didn’t go our way,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “It was a great experience for us to play a top-ranked team, and we believe we can play with anybody.”
The Bulls grabbed the first point of the afternoon in a sweep of the three doubles matches.
Junior captain Samantha Rosekrans and sophomore Holly Cao were blanked 8-0 by the No. 15 duo in the country, Melissa Koning and Irene Rehberger, while the other two courts kept the doubles point briefly in limbo.
At No. 3 doubles, sophomore Caroline Davis and freshman Alexandra Lehman traded games with their opponents, eventually knotting the score at 6-6 before dropping the next two games to concede the doubles point to South Florida.
“It was a really tight doubles match, Green said. “I’m really proud of them.”
Beside them, freshmen Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton were up 6-3 but they unexpectedly gave up their lead. Although they were able to tie the score at 7-7, the final two games went in the Bulls’ favor to give them a doubles sweep and keep the momentum on their side.
“No. 2 and No. 3 were really close,” Rosekrans said. “They could have gone either way.”
In the singles matches, freshman Sophie Chang lost, 6-0, 6-4, to put the Crimson at a 2-0 deficit, but No. 115 Tachibana quickly pulled her team back within one point with a victory of her own, 6-4, 6-1. Tachibana is now 7-3 at No. 2 this season.
“Hideko’s opponent was throwing a lot of things at her,” Green said. “She responded well and pushed her game to another level.”
Norton dropped her first set 6-1, but quickly took the lead in the second, 3-0. Unfortunately for Harvard, Norton then suffered a light ankle sprain, which hindered her ability to close out the set. Despite coming within a game of victory at 5-4, she lost the next three games to lose the set, 7-5, effectively giving South Florida its third point.
“[The ankle sprain] threw her off her game and took her out of contention,” Green said.
Norton will visit the trainer when she returns to Cambridge to assess her condition to play in the squad’s next match.
A 6-4, 6-0 loss by sophomore Samantha Gridley gave the Bulls their clinching point, and brought them to 5-0 record on their home court.
Despite her team’s loss, No. 84 Cao had something to prove in the No. 1 court against No. 35 Irene Rehberger. In a hard fought match, Cao took the first set 6-3, but lost the second 6-2. In the deciding super tie-break, Cao battled to a 10-5 win to earn the Crimson’s second point of the afternoon.
“I kept calm and think I played a good match overall,” Cao said. “I need to keep being aggressive even if I’m making errors.”
The win against her higher ranked opponent moved Cao to 8-1 and will likely help improve her national ranking.
“Holly believes she can beat anybody in the country, and her teammates believe that as well,” Green said. “Holly was feeling under the weather but pulled out the victory for the team.”
To close the contest, Rosekrans battled back from an opening set 6-3 loss to take the second set 6-4. But in her super tie-break, feeling tired on the burning tennis court, she succumbed to a 10-6 loss.
“I feel like I got heat stroke or something,” Rosekrans said. “I was suffering from extremely low energy.”
Despite yesterday’s loss, the team is looking forward to playing outdoors again next week, when it continues its seven-match stretch away from the Murr Center and travels to California, before returning home for the start of the Ivy League season in April.
“I feel like the outdoor conditions actually suit our team,” Green said. “We have a lot of players who grew up playing outdoors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it mattered most, Kyle Richter finally came to play.
The talented yet inconsistent junior goalie had the best two-game stretch of his season last weekend in the first round of the ECAC playoffs, recording 33 and 37 saves respectively on back-to-back nights as Harvard swept the Princeton Tigers.
“Personally, I felt good,” Richter said. “The guys in front of me really did a good job in allowing me to see shots and made my job a lot easier...I thought it was a great team effort.”
On Friday night, Richter saved all but two of the shots fired at him, as the Crimson defeated its Ivy rivals, 4-2. He made a fantastic save on Princeton forward Mark Magnowski’s shot when he stretched out his left leg and blocked the puck with the tip of his skate early in the second period, which prevented the Tigers from going up 2-0 and having the momentum swing completely in their favor.
On Saturday night, Richter was perfect, earning the fifth shutout of his career and his first in the playoffs as Harvard won 3-0. He did not allow a goal in the final four periods of the series.
“Richter has been a big player for us,” freshman forward Luke Greiner said. “He steps up in big games and makes the saves we need him to make.”
Richter has been especially strong in Ivy League play, in which he saved 121 of the 131 shots against him during the regular season—a .924 save percentage, which led the Ancient Eight. He also allowed an average of just 2.48 goals per game in Ivy play, good for second in the conference. These statistics earned him an All-Ivy League honorable mention.
Despite this success, Richter struggled mightily at other times this year. He was unable to hold down the starting job since it was granted to him coming into the season, and ended up battling with fellow junior Ryan Carroll for playing time. He ended up starting only 15 games, compared to 13 for Carroll.
“Ryan and myself are really good friends on and off the ice,” Richter said. “We’ve really competed hard with each other and pushed each other throughout the year.”
Richter finished just 3-13-2 during the regular season, the worst winning percentage of any goalie in the conference, and often showed signs of rust after he took the 2008-2009 season off.
“Coming back, I’ve had to really focus on the swing of this year and get really back into game shape,” the goalie said. “It took a little bit to get back and get comfortable playing again at the college level...There was definitely a transition period.”
But the talent was clearly there, and Richter’s play picked up late in the season as he began to show signs of the goalie who won the Ken Dryden Award for the ECAC’s top goaltender as a sophomore in 2007-2008. In the five final contests Richter played in, he did not allow more than three goals in a game.  And in the playoffs, Richter started and allowed two goals or less twice in a row—something he had done in only three games during the regular season.
His teammates realize that his dedication is producing results at the most important time.
“He’s been working really hard all year, but it’s really starting to pay off,” junior forward Michael Biega said.  “[Recently] he’s been playing really well for us.”
Next up for Richter and his teammates is the No. 9 Cornell Big Red, another Ancient Eight foe. Richter saved 23 of 25 shots against Cornell on February 19, but his team still lost 3-0.  Yet the goalie feels that the team the Big Red will be facing in Ithaca this weekend will be a better version of the one it defeated last month.
“Based on the last two games against Princeton, I thought we’ve been playing the best hockey that we have all year,” Richter said. “This weekend was a true product of what we can do as a team.”
Richter has been in this spot before. In 2008, he took on Cornell in the ECAC semifinals in Albany and was outstanding, making 31 saves in a 3-1 Crimson victory.
In the hostile environment at Lynah Rink, the goalie will have to be as focused and confident as he was then if he is going to lead his team to a series win.
“I think he just has to play as strong as he did last weekend,” Biega said. “We’re going to try to play as well as we can defensively, and not give them many shots at his face. He just has to make the first save, and we’ll try to keep the puck away from him.”
That is exactly what happened against Princeton, when Richter forgot his regular season struggles and played like a reborn goalie.
“We didn’t approach [the series] any differently than we did during the regular season,” he said. “We saw it as a second opportunity to show how we can play as a team.”
Harvard now has a third opportunity to prove its doubters wrong, and his teammates believe that with Richter in net, anything is possible. Because when the goalie brings his A-game, his teammates are able to step it up as well.
“He’s really started to peak and has been phenomenal for us the last few weekends,” Greiner said. “He makes everybody a better player.”

Remember that time when setting large objects on fire and sending them down the Charles was good, clean fun? That time is no more. Unfortunately for the class of 2013, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman '67 sent out an e-mail last week outlining strict consequences for those brave souls who participate in certain River Run events this year. So what do freshmen think about this? We asked, and here's what they told us.
"I think the e-mail is kind of comical. I know a lot of people who don't take it seriously," said Ashtynn B. Baltimore '13. "I wasn't planning on participating, but most people who were haven't changed their plans."
Her suggestions for an alternative? "We should have a freshmen-only Primal Scream. Or maybe we could toilet paper the Houses we don't like. No matter what, we should come up with something less dangerous. We need to have some sort of a tradition."
Not all freshmen are so law-abiding.
"I'm definitely still doing it, even though I might make my boat kind of small," said one freshman in Annenberg Hall who didn't want to be named. "I will also definitely be drinking. I don't want to be in Winthrop, and I have to please the gods somehow."
When asked about the First Year Social Committee's slumber party alternative, the freshman said, "You can't end a real alternative at 12. People will just go out drinking afterwards anyways."
"I just don't want to be in the Quad," said another freshman. "If I can't light a boat on fire, I'll just burn down the Quad. Then there's no way I can get placed there."
We're not exactly a fan of that idea, since where you'll probably end up is going to look much more like a prison than any room in Canaday Hall ever did.
So to those freshmen wishing to avoid the wrath of the River gods, try some of these alternatives, avoid reserving yourself a room in a state penitentiary, have a cry-fest while reading about River Run experiences that you will never have, and get excited about Housing Day!

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about our project.
For those who like returning home to tranquility, a good dinner, and a loving community, Currier is the House for you. Though the decor is less than postcard-worthy—yes, we do have cinder blocks—postcards generally don’t make the best of living spaces. Singles abound in Currier (both the person and room variety), and everything is under one roof—as should be the case in a House—so you never have to deal with any of the entryway alphabet soup that forces you out into the cold rain in order to get to the dining hall. (Take that, River Houses.) Described in a few words, Currier is unpretentious, comfortable, and airy—all in all, a great place to live.
Dining Hall: Currier's food is pretty much unanimously acknowledged to be the best on campus, earning Currier five stars. Unlike the Adams servery dungeon where the scent of yesterday’s congealed Cajun chicken wafts over today’s pot of baked beans, Currier’s servery is fresh, airy, and always musical (the d-hall staff always has the radio on). Special dishes are served at dinner fairly frequently, and the phenomenal dining hall staff is always willing to bring out whatever isn’t out front. This last point should be emphasized: Currier’s dining hall staff is out of this world. As for brain break, though it may be decimated by 10 p.m., rye bread and grape jelly are always by the toaster for those returning late from Lamont.
Score: +1 million for amazing food
Common Spaces: Currier is chock full of secret rooms, comfy chairs, and plenty of places to lounge. Behind the dining hall is the Matthew Strominger Room; off the main hallway are the Bingham Living Room, the Poker Room, and the Treehouse, all of which can be reserved for events with very little hassle. Ping pong, air hockey, and pool are frequently played on the tables outside the d-hall. Many suites boast kitchens, and we must not forget the Fishbowl, a large multi-purpose room right at the entrance of Currier that is the Hell of "Heaven and Hell," home base for stein clubs, and a favorite TV-watching spot for many.
Score: +50 for a variety of rooms, +25 for fun stuff to do
Rooms: Seventy percent of sophomores are placed in singles, and there are never mice, roaches, or awkward walkthroughs. How does the Quad sound now? Though the notion is an odd one, many Currier singles are connected to each other by “sink rooms,” which are exactly what they sound like. As for exciting upperclassman housing, Currier boasts the 10-(wo)man, several solariums (complete with balconies that wrap around the house and provide a view of the Boston skyline), and several suite concoctions. And don’t worry about lugging your bags up nine flights of stairs when you move in: Currier has elevators. Props for being post-bellum.
Score: +100 for the abundance of singles
House spirit: Currier residents love Currier House. It’s pretty simple. The Currier House Committee is wild. They planned House bowling in August and House ice skating in February. Stein clubs, always packed, have themes ranging from Kindergarten to Camping, and the House list is extremely active. CurrierWire digest might be the way to go for the spam-intolerant, as people have been known to unsubscribe. The mascot, Woody the Tree, is beloved for his arboreal wonder. If you live here, you will love it too.
Score: +40 for fun events, +30 for a fun e-mail list, -25 for the spam
Location: Currier has many perks, but location is not one of them. The House is in the Quad, and that is a fact Currier residents embrace out of necessity. However, the shuttle does pick up and drop off people at Currier’s porch, so if the shuttle is your preferred mode of transportation, it’s a pretty painless process to get to the Yard. To get to Sever Hall, hop off the Shuttle at Garden Street, and you can be in class in about 12 minutes after leaving your room. CVS is about 10 minutes away. Alternatively, there is a Rite Aid in Porter Square a few blocks from the Quad itself. And despite what River dwellers may insist when you want them to come visit you, the walk isn’t bad at all. In fact, on a nice day, it’s quite lovely—and just far enough to listen to two and a half songs on your iPod.
Score: -1,000 for being in the Quad, +800 for still having a bunch of places close by
Quirks: Like to dance? Currier has its own studio. Like yoga? Classes get e-mailed out in our newsletter. Like drawing nudes? The Office for the Arts offers a figure drawing class in Currier. Like meeting famous professors in your House? Attend events held by our temporarily departing House Masters, biological anthropology Professor Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross, for Currier Conversations.
Score: +20 for a set of really sweet perks
Committee Rank: 8 out of 12, a respectable place in the top 75 percent.
Our Rankings So Far:
8. Currier
9. Leverett
10. Dunster
11. Cabot
12. Winthrop
