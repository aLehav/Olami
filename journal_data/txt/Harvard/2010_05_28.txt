After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Christiane Amanpour—CNN’s former chief international correspondent and future host of ABC’s “This Week”—said that her “first act of courage” as the 2010 Class Day speaker would be to remove her suit jacket in this afternoon’s “incredibly hot” weather, a reported 88 degrees.
Amanpour urged students to find their passions, travel the world in an age of increasing global interconnectivity, and—above all else—be informed citizens.
Along the way, she alluded to a variety of historical figures ranging from Robert F. Kennedy ’48 to Elizabeth Taylor’s seventh husband, the Republican senator John W. Warner.
Most notably, however, her speech referenced former Secretary of State George C. Marshall’s commencement address, delivered on the same spot 63 years before and considered among the most famous in Harvard’s history.
In his June 1947 address, Marshall articulated the need for massive American support for the rebuilding of Europe, which had been devastated during World War II. According to Amanpour, Marshall’s words ring true in a world in which the United States still must determine its role in the future development of countries like Afghanistan and Haiti.
“America’s challenges today remain the same,” Amanpour said, echoing Marshall’s sentiment that “what seems far away will nevertheless affect you even here.”
Amanpour said that as a journalist, she has to come believe deeply in people’s responsibility to keep themselves informed, adding that she hopes members of the class of 2010 will consider becoming journalists after graduation.
“I am a true believer in the power of this profession to be a force for good,” she said. “Where would we be without a press that’s uncovered injustice, corruption, inhumanity—or a press that’s on the cutting edge of reform, civil rights, desegregation and of all the smaller but vital issues that affect us every single day?”
Amanpour noted, however, that she is often troubled by the lack of substantive discussion in public discourse.
“I believe so deeply in the promise of America and Americans that it does frustrate me to see the limited discussion of important issues in public spaces,” she said. “And yet as I travel all over the world, people know everything about you and everything about your country.”
At the end of her speech, Amanpour recounted her own career path, which began after she arrived at CNN in Atlanta after her own graduation with only $100 and a suitcase. She said she worked nights and weekends to achieve her goals and reminded the graduating seniors that “there’s no such thing as effortless success.”
But Amanpour, who said that she, too, will graduate from her “alma mater” of CNN this fall, sympathized with the graduates she addressed.
“I’m sure that all of us graduates here today share same sense of excitement, the same sense of promise of a brave new adventure, the shadow of fear, trepidation, and anxiety as we hurl ourselves out of our comfort zones,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As he stood before thousands of Harvard alumni, former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 did not take his audience’s intelligence for granted, using his Commencement address to argue against limiting Constitutional interpretation to mere textual analysis.
Souter, 70, who stepped down from the high court in 2009, avoided legal jargon and offered what audience members called an accessible explanation of his judicial philosophy.
In his 30-minute speech, the thin, gray-haired man from New Hampshire—who has been associated with the court’s liberal wing—argued that “Constitutional judging is not a mere combination of fair reading and simple facts.”
Souter offered a rebuttal of what he termed “the fair reading model,” which calls for an analysis of the Constitution that is grounded in the language of the Constitution—at the expense of a more nuanced analysis that considers the contemporary values and outlooks that can shape judicial decisions.
In his criticism of the model, Souter considered two famous decisions handed down by the nation’s most powerful court: the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 and Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954.
While the Court ultimately found that the United States did not have enough evidence to prohibit The New York Times and The Washington Post from printing classified documents about the Vietnam War, Souter said the case demonstrated that the Court does not uphold the absolute inviolability of the First Amendment.
“Even the First Amendment, then, expressing the value of speech and publications in the terms of a right as paramount as any fundamental can be, does not quite get to the point of an absolute guarantee,” Souter said.
Instead, opposing provisions of the Constitution must be reconciled to come to the final decision, he added.
The fair reading model, Souter noted, fails because the Constitution must be “read as a whole, and when it is, other values crop up in potential conflict with an unfettered right to publish, the value of security for the nation and the value of the President’s authority in matters foreign and military.”
In her remarks to alumni minutes before Souter’s speech, University President Drew G. Faust praised the justice’s dedication to public service.
Phil Bakker, whose son graduated from the College this spring, said that he enjoyed Souter’s speech and said that he “better understood what it takes to be a justice” afterwards.
Superior Court Judge William L. Downing, a parent of a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, said that he was glad that Souter did not feel the need to pander to the audience.
“It’s a rather intelligent gathering,” he said. He added that while the justice’s speech was about judicial philosophy, “it was inspiring in its own way.”
Last year Secretary of Energy and Nobel Laureate Steven Chu gave the Commencement address. Renowned journalist Christiane Amanpour delivered this year’s Class Day speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time that History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 tried to ask his wife—MIT History Professor Pauline R. Maier ’60—on a date, she turned him down. He was a Harvard sophomore, and she was a Radcliffe student who was too busy for romance. At the time, they were both on The Crimson: he already a member of the News Board, she a recently elected writer.
Fifty years later, this tale of East Coast Harvard boy meets Midwestern Radcliffe girl is an ongoing story of love and learning in Cambridge.
“We came from totally different backgrounds; I came from a nonaffiliated Jewish family in the suburbs,” said Charles, referring to his New York City roots. His family moved to Scarsdale, N.Y. when he was nine, and he had attended a public high school there. He applied to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton before settling on Harvard because it suited him the best.
On the other hand, Pauline Rubbelke, as she was known at the time, was a parochial school girl from a working class family in St. Paul, Minn. She had never even heard of Radcliffe, she said, until she followed an acquaintance to a Radcliffe information session. There, she caught the attention of the alumni presenters by daring to be the only girl to raise her hand and ask a question.
“The graduates went into a spin about this,” Pauline said. “They noticed I was there, and they tried to find out who I was.”
Eventually, Pauline was admitted to Radcliffe, and in her sophomore year, she decided to comp The Crimson. It was there that she met Charles.
“I found her very striking,” Charles said, “but I couldn’t really ask her out while she was on the comp.”
Pauline said she remembers that Charles, after noticing that she was reading about Transcendentalism, first tried to catch her eye by giving her long lectures on the subject.
“I’m sure he was very proud of his lectures on Transcendentalists,” said Pauline, admitting that she found them a bit boring. “But he was very knowledgeable.”
After the comp, Charles attempted to ask Pauline out on a date, but he said that she initially rejected the offer because she was studious and did not have time to go out.
“I kept asking, and she kept postponing,” he said.
“The great joy of going to Radcliffe was that if someone asked you out on a Saturday night and you really preferred to stay home and study, it wasn’t understood to be a put-off,” Pauline said, adding that this did not seem to be the case at Wellesley.
Finally, after exams were over, Pauline agreed to a date with Charles, but their courtship was confined by the restrictions of the era.
“I imagine sexual relations are much more casual [nowadays],” said Charles, remembering how male students had to sign in female visitors, who then had to leave by a designated time. “The dorms weren’t integrated” at the time, he said, and that would not begin to change until 1970.
Pauline said she also remembers how restrictive the policies were during her undergraduate years, citing an incident when she was caught smoking with a friend around the same time that Fidel Castro came to speak at Harvard.
“I couldn’t go see Castro. I’m still pretty annoyed by it,” she said, referring to her punishment for the offense. “It was a historic event, and I missed it.”
After graduating in 1960, Charles with a degree in History and Pauline with a degree in History and Literature, the couple went to England for a year to further their studies. He had received a Henry Fellowship at St. Antony’s College, Oxford, and she was a Fulbright scholar at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Afterward, they married at Oxford and toured Europe together.
“How lucky he was to find such an intelligent and beautiful companion for life in Pauline Maier,” said Bryce E. Nelson ’59, Charles’s former colleague on The Crimson. “He obviously has much going for him if he could persuade her to marry him.”
The couple later returned to Harvard, where they began to pursue doctorate degrees in history. Charles focused on European history, while Pauline found herself drawn to American history.
“This couple basically covers the northern hemisphere in terms of history,” said Susan J. Diamond ’60, Pauline’s friend from Radcliffe. “That’s sort of a good portion of the civilized world, so they complement each other. They draw on each other.”
Eventually, both were able to secure tenured professorships in Cambridge—Charles returned to Harvard, where he has served as chair of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies and director of the Center for European Studies, and Pauline found her way to MIT, where she mostly teaches early American history.
After raising three children, the couple now looks forward to evenings spent with their dogs and weekends spent at their home in Rhode Island, where Charles drives a tractor around while Pauline gardens and cooks.
Diamond said that Pauline best summed up her life with Charles in one sentence: “I’d gladly live the same life over again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If more people followed women’s heavyweight crew, co-captain Laura Huppert might have been recognized by ESPN before now. And if more people followed wrestling, co-captain J.P. O’Connor, whose national championship victory was broadcast on the network, would be a household name. As it so happens, neither is the case. But because the athletes matched their athletic achievements with academic prowess, both have recently been named to the ESPN the Magazine All-District First Team.
The two athletes have earned a combined four All-America honors—three for O’Connor, one for Huppert—and seven NCAA appearances.
Beyond their excellence in sports and in the classroom, the pair has two more things in common. Both are science concentrators—Huppert studies molecular and cellular biology, while O’Connor concentrates in human evolutionary biology—and both can’t seem to say goodbye to the campus where they’ve excelled.
Huppert will remain in Cambridge to continue her tuberculosis research. The rower won a Hoopes Prize for her thesis on the disease, in which she studied Bacillus subtilis in order to be able to make comparisons to TB. O’Connor, meanwhile, will be staying on with the Crimson wrestling program, where he will help coach the team while he trains for the 2012 Olympics.
While Huppert’s days being recognized by ESPN are likely over as she turns her focus toward the medical profession, O’Connor’s might be just beginning if he succeeds in his goal to represent the U.S. in London.
Water polo co-captain Egen Atkinson, women’s swimming co-captain Alexandra Clarke, and sophomore fencing co-captain Noam Mills were named to the All-District Second Team.
