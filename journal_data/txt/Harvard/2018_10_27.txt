After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
10 Days. That is all that separates Harvard Men’s Basketball from the beginning of its 2018-2019 campaign, which will commence with a home tilt against Cambridge rivals MIT. The Crimson has had nearly seven and a half months to reflect upon the disappointment of a three-point loss to Penn, the hosts of last year’s Ivy League Championship. Adding a strong recruiting class, and retaining over 99 percent of last year’s scoring, Harvard will have its sights firmly placed on the Ancient Eight Title, and a return to the NCAA Tournament.
With the new season approaching, coach Tommy Amaker sat down with the other seven coaches in the conference for a preseason primer. Moderated by ESPN’s Dalen Cuff, the coaches discussed a host of other topics specific to the Ivy League and the state of college basketball as a whole.
Here are some of the highlights from the roundtable discussion, highlighted by three major themes: Recruiting, Media Exposure, and Rising Talent.
RECRUITING
In the wake of numerous FBI investigations into the recruiting practices of various Division I programs, the coaches discussed the current climate around Ancient Eight recruiting.
“The one great thing about being in this conference is that that’s not a pool that we swim in,” said Yale coach James Jones, who has led the Bulldogs’ program since 1999. “It makes what we do really special, because you’re dealing with people who want to go to school and do things the right way.”
Coach Amaker echoed Jones’ thoughts, while shedding light on identifying the families and players that are a good fit for the league’s goals.
“All of us sitting here recognize who we represent, and try to identify those particular kids and families that value what we can offer,” Amaker said. “Even kids who are ranked higher, we’re finding that players are looking for a particular type of opportunity, and we represent many brands that have been pretty magical for a bunch of kids out there.”
Columbia’s Jim Engles touched upon the nature of recruiting in a league that does not offer athletic scholarships.
“I think it’s a true sense of the educational component of being a student-athlete because kids and their parents are investing in their education,” said Engles, who is entering his third season in Morningside Heights. “With all the mentoring, and the internship opportunities, it almost becomes as a priceless, lifelong scholarship for them.”
“I think we double down, in the Ivy League, on who we are,” added Princeton coach Mitch Henderson, on the character of the conference. “A world-class student-athlete experience, it separates us from competitors, but it’s also the right thing to be doing, in terms of pursuing a four-year degree.”
NATIONAL EXPOSURE
The upcoming season will mark the first year of a 10-year partnership between the Ivy League and ESPN, that will air every conference game on ESPN+, with a host of matchups finding national airtime across the ESPN linear television spectrum.
Coach Jones shed light on the boost that the Ivy League’s partnership with ESPN will continue to give the teams, focusing on the transition from the perception of the Ancient Eight as an underperforming conference.
“I think that with the advent of more television, being on ESPN, and having people watch us play and have success at the same time, that perception is beginning to change,” Jones explained. “When people see that, and notice that not only are we amongst the best schools in the country academically, but we can compete with some of the best basketball teams… it makes it a little easier for people to see who we are.”
“When people turn on their TVs, they’re going to see really high level basketball,” said Brown coach Mike Martin of the league’s quality. “The exposure that we’ll get on ESPN will be outstanding for us.”
“The visibility is so crucial,” Cornell coach Brian Earl said. “When you think about athletics on TV, you think ESPN, and when you think about the highest level of education in the world, you think about the Ivy League. So when you start putting those things together, you don’t need to do too much recruiting-wise.”
RISING TALENT
While the influx of national attention that the ESPN deal will bring Ancient Eight Basketball is important, all of the coaches emphasized the rise of talent across all eight teams that has occurred over the past decade.
“People will start seeing that every team in this league has guys that can play anywhere in the country, and that’s not an exaggeration,” coach Martin said.
Several of the coaches referenced the difficulty they face in scheduling out of conference matchups, and point to it as a testament to the league’s widespread quality.
“When I was in the league prior, in the 2000s, you could schedule almost any game you wanted,” Penn’s coach Steve Donohue said. “But now, the level of play in this league has stopped teams that would typically schedule you, into thinking twice about it.”
Along with an influx of skill into the Ancient Eight, there has been an astonishing level of parity across the last two seasons, exacerbated by the advent of Ivy Madness.
“We’ve already touched on it, but this league from top to bottom has been ultra competitive,” said Coach Earl. “As Ivy League student-athletes, these kids want to compete in every way, in the classroom and on the court.”
Once a league that straggled behind its Division I peers, the Ivy League has clearly become a home for exceptionally talented players.
“I’ve been on the phone with more NBA scouts this offseason than ever,” coach Martin said. “It’s not just about the players we have, but it’s about everyone in the league. I think the league is headed for a very exciting future.”
As a fresh season draws near, Amaker and the rest of the Ancient Eight’s coaches will hope that the league’s status and quality continues to rise, helping create a new era for Ivy League basketball.
The Crimson will host the Engineers at 7pm on November 6th, as the tip-off to a season that holds much promise for a hungry Harvard team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The forecast predicted snow, but on Saturday afternoon the mercury barely crept over 32 degrees. Instead, Dartmouth and Harvard dueled under a frigid, drizzly New Hampshire sky. On its home turf, the Big Green prevailed in the soggy contest, 24-17.
In front of a clamoring homecoming crowd, Dartmouth (7-0, 4-0 Ivy) shattered a 14-year losing streak against the Crimson (3-4, 1-3). The last time the Big Green bested Harvard in Hanover, N.H., was 25 years ago, when the home team won by five.
“It’s been something that I think has kind of hung over this program’s head for a while, and I think it’s tough to put in words what we’re feeling right now since we just won the game,” Dartmouth linebacker Jack Traynor said. “We’re going to do our thing. We’re going to play Dartmouth football, and hopefully this win allows us to shift [towards] that perspective.”
But the Big Green entered the match with a streak of its own — nine games. That number, now 10, represents consecutive games the team has won, and it is only the eighth time in program history Dartmouth has notched a double-digit win streak.
The Big Green’s most recent loss came almost exactly one year ago today, on Oct. 28 and at the hands of the Crimson. The last three contests between the two squads have been nail biters. This one bucked the trend, as Dartmouth — which has the best overall defense in the FCS — jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter and never relented.
The wet conditions affected game play from even before to the first snap. On the opening kick, the Big Green’s Connor Davis booted the ball to the Harvard seven, before it bounced end-over-end off the field, racking up a 10-yard penalty for the home team.
Seven minutes in, Crimson senior quarterback Tom Stewart rocketed a pass to senior Henry Taylor who cupped the pass before it hit the ground. The referees reviewed the play for approximately 10 minutes. While the referees huddled near the 20 yard line, the players on both teams did jumping jacks on the field to stay warm.
Dartmouth’s first snap of the contest would have been a touchdown absent the conditions. Despite leading the FCS in completion percentage and pass efficiency — going a perfect nine-for-nine last week — Big Green sophomore quarterback Derek Kyler threw short to his wide-open receiver, J.J. Jefferies.
It didn’t matter, since on the very next play Dartmouth went to ground and then to the end zone with Rashaad Cooper’s 82-yard long rush — the eighth longest in program history.
Aside from the passing deficiencies, Harvard struggled to hold onto the ball. Through the first 30 minutes of the contest, the Crimson put the ball on the turf five times, losing it on four separate occasions. The Big Green didn’t fumble the ball once.
“It’s definitely a little slippery, but we’re just kind of conscious of that while we’re carrying the ball, especially seeing it happen on the other side,” Cooper said. “We knew that we had to be extra protective of the ball. I think we got it done.”
 Freshman wideout Kym Wimberly set up to return the final kick of the half. As the first year sprinted up the visiting sideline, a defender forced him in and another hit the ball as he wrapped up. The ball bounced off the feet of several players before Dartmouth recovered.
The first Harvard fumble doubly counted as the Big Green’s second score. As Crimson senior running back Charlie Booker sprinted up field, Dartmouth’s Niko Lalos punched the ball out. DeWayne Terry scooped the wayward ball and sprinted 62 yards for the score.
As Harvard drove in the opening drive of the second stanza, Stewart completed his pass to running back B.J. Watson, who was subsequently stripped at the home eight-yard line. The Big Green didn’t reverse the field for six on this drive, rather going a quick three-and-out before punting the ball back to the Crimson.
Sophomore running back Aaron Shampklin was stripped on the next drive. As the sophomore pushed for a few extra yards in the pile, Dartmouth’s Jack Traynor ran up behind Shampklin and pulled the ball out.
“One thing we always know, when you go into a game like this, the turnover ratio, the ball security is going to be a critical aspect of any big game,” Murphy said. “It’s certainly going to be a critical aspect of every game you play in less than perfect weather, so certainly that had an impact on us.”
Harvard nearly pulled off a miracle comeback down the stretch in the fourth quarter. Stewart entered the half staring down a 21-point deficit, but as feisty as ever. The defense pushed the offense off the field in six plays. Then Stewart took the reins, completing passes to five different route runners before dishing the ball to Shampklin to barrel his way to score from seven yards out.
Despite Shampklin’s rushing touchdown, after 60 minutes, Stewart led the team in rushing yards with 76, a career high. The senior has been seemingly more willing to tuck the ball and sprint up the field than in previous contests, securing long third downs on multiple occasions.
As the Big Green pushed the contest into a three possession game in the late third quarter, Stewart wasn’t ready to hand over the loss just yet. As the Crimson took over in the fourth, when the senior didn’t complete the requisite passes for the first down, he would sprint forward himself. On a long third-and-10, Stewart got pushed from the box by Lalos and sprinted 12 yards to push the chains. Two plays later, Stewart dodged two tackles before maneuvering 22 yards to the endzone.
“Things weren’t there, obviously I was trying to make some plays with my feet,” Stewart said. “[Dartmouth] did a great job up front and are very physical. [They] collapsed the pocket a few times and I just tried to make something out of nothing a few times.”
Harvard has led halftime comebacks in past renditions of this game before. Last season, the Crimson trailed by eight at the half. In 2015, Harvard trailed by 10. In both contests, the Crimson pulled out the victory by three points and one point, respectively.
Today, the second half effort wasn’t enough.
The Big Green dominated the ground game, accumulating 320 rushing yards throughout the contest. Junior “quarterback” Jared Gerbino led the effort, notching a season high 183 rushing yards for Dartmouth and adding a touchdown to match. Cooper added 108 yards to that tally, a career high.
In addition to Gerbino running from under center, Cooper tallied 117 on 11 attempts in the backfield — a career high for the tailback.
With five fumbles on carries, Harvard preferred to air the ball out. Despite the inclement conditions, Stewart tossed the ball 42 times, completing 24 attempts for 270 yards — two yards short of a season high.
“[That] wasn’t necessarily the plan coming in, but this was definitely the best run defense we’ll face all year,” Murphy said. “Their front seven, starting with their front four, is definitely very challenging to run the football against.”
The Big Green couldn’t replicate the feat, completing only four of 11 passes between the two quarterbacks. Without a single touchdown pass, today’s contest ended the school record 17-consecutive games that Dartmouth had tallied six points on a throw.
“I think the weather helped a lot with that, and game plan,” captain safety Zach Miller said. “ [We] got him to play a little bit left-handed. [They] had to go with the wildcat quarterback a little bit, and get out of their comfort zone.”
 No. 20/ARV Dartmouth is still undefeated, and is one of only four FCS squads to boast a perfect record. The Big Green was the Crimson’s third ranked opponent this season, the result of schedule that included also No. 18/23 Princeton and No. 20/22 Rhode Island. Of Harvard’s four losses this season, three have come to each of the ranked opponents. Never before has the Crimson played three ranked teams in one season.
The last time a team with two losses won the Ivy League was 1982. With this loss to Dartmouth, Harvard now has three Ancient Eight losses.
“We feel like a couple plays here and there, we could be undefeated right now,” Stewart said. “We’ve been in every game we’ve played in, and we owe it to ourselves, we owe it to our fans, we owe it to every single guy in our locker room to take these last three games as seriously as ever because we’re not just playing for our record, we’re playing for the guys in the locker room. That’s what it really comes down to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H. — Coming into overtime, the Harvard men’s hockey team’s season opener against Dartmouth had already checked off just about everything you’d want to see in a hockey game. Goals aplenty, as the squads were tied, 6-6, after 60 minutes. Dramatic penalties galore. Even broken glass, the victim of a hard point shot during a Crimson power play, that required a brief delay to replace. An enthusiastic Big Green home crowd settled in for extra hockey, waiting to see how much longer the contest would go on.
Not very long, as it turned out. Just 18 seconds into overtime, Dartmouth sophomore forward Quin Foreman beat Harvard senior net-minder Michael Lackey, sending Thompson Arena into raptures. The Big Green (1-0-0, 1-0-0 ECAC) handed the Crimson (0-1-0, 0-1-0) its first season-opening loss since 2011 with a barn-burner that featured five erased leads.
“We had some positives and negatives, but we battled real hard,” said junior defenseman Adam Fox. “When you have a lead going into the third you want to hold it, and we persevered really well…but overall it’s disappointing not to come away with the win.”
After conceding a power play goal halfway through the first period, Harvard found itself on the receiving end of three straight man-advantage opportunities. For the first two of those, the power play unit — significantly different, and younger, than last year’s — had enough chances to tilt the shot clock wildly in the Crimson’s favor. On the final power play, with a little over a minute remaining in the period, the visitors finally broke through, as sophomore forward Jack Badini cleaned up loose change around the Dartmouth net. Twenty seconds later, junior forward Colton Kerfoot got his first career goal, once again after a tussle in the blue paint.
The floodgates opened from there, and with that came some extracurricular activities. The middle 20 saw seven penalties, including a contentious embellishment call against Badini that had head coach Ted Donato ’91 fuming on the bench. Each team potted two goals in the second; both Harvard goals came on the power play, from sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh and rookie forward Baker Shore. The Big Green retaliated after each Crimson tally, bringing the score after two periods to 4-3 with the visitors leading.
“The game was choppy,” coach Donato said. “Which is somewhat to be expected, first game of the year, whatnot. But I liked the resilience of the group; [they] kept coming back.”
Additional power play goals in the third from Walsh and Fox, however, were not enough to preserve Harvard’s lead. Dartmouth entered the final period with extra energy, finding twine three times. The Big Green’s dangerous top line, with only one tally to its name against the Crimson coming into the game, combined three minutes after intermission for the go-ahead goal, and the team did not fall behind again.
Despite the loss, Harvard has numerous positive takeaways, the most significant being the power play’s 5-for-7 contribution. The goal-scoring extravaganza also featured rookies notching their first points in crimson and white: forward Baker Shore tallied on the man advantage, while defenseman Jack Rathbone and forwards Jack Drury and Casey Dornbach each picked up assists.
“[Assistant coach] Rassey does a great job with our powerplay," coach Donato said. "We have some excellent players that shoot the puck and I thought we scored in a number of different ways…. That’s certainly a positive coming out of the game. If we get a game with five power play goals and score six goals, we should be able to taste victory after a game like that.”
Momentum on the 5-on-4s was driven by point shots from defensemen like Walsh, Fox, and Rathbone — unsurprising, given the Crimson blue line’s experience and skill. Saturday night was a multi-point outing for both Fox (1–3—4) and Walsh (2–0—0), which bodes well for a team with a young forward corps.
“We have some new pieces that are still trying to…find their chemistry,” Fox said. “Coming back for the third year and having the experience I have, the thing I want to do is step up, be a leader on this team and produce in every way I can.”
Opening the season for the first time in his career, Lackey (7.04 GAA, .741 SV%) had alternating bursts of poise and shakiness. He stopped multiple breakaways, and slid pipe to pipe to rob a charging Dartmouth forward, to the chagrin of Thompson Arena. Still, conceding seven goals — five of which were at even strength — makes any contest difficult to win.
“I’m not taking [Lackey] off the hook either,” said coach Donato when asked if the onus for the Crimson’s goals against should be on the skaters or the goalie. “There’s five guys on the ice before it gets to the goalie…but I don’t think we got a good enough effort there to win either.”
The team will get back to righting the ship with a slate of home games next weekend, as Harvard plays host to Quinnipiac and Princeton.
