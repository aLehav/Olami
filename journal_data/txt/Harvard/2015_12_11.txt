After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given recent racially-charged events at Yale, Mizzou, and Harvard Law School, the imperative for
racial and ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, gender, and sexual diversity among Harvard’s Counseling and Mental
Health Services clinicians comes at an urgent time. Marginalized
students (including students of color and minority religions, first-generation
students, BGLTQ+ students, undocumented students, and students from low-income
backgrounds) on college campuses bear the burden of institutional racism and
social oppression on top of academic and extracurricular loads—even at Harvard. Microaggressions (like the recurring doubt of whether students of
color, too, are Harvard students), macroaggressions (like the creation of the
White Student Union and taping over black faculty portraits at Harvard Law
School), and lack of culturally-specific academic and social resources
remind us that Harvard is not exempt from social injustices. This reality takes
its toll on the mental health of many students and we can no longer wait for
change at Harvard’s pace. We need diverse CAMHS clinicians who understand our
unique frustrations and concerns now.
Across the nation, marginalized communities are
disproportionately vulnerable to mental health conditions but lack access to
adequate resources for economic and cultural reasons. Black Americans, for
example, are 20 percent more likely to report serious
psychological distress, but are about half as likely to receive mental health services
than their white counterparts. Similar trends exist among Asian-American, Latinx, Native American and BGLTQ+ communities.
Many of these individuals cannot attain health insurance for economic, social,
or legal reasons. In addition, stigma, shame, and prejudice surrounding mental health conditions
are huge barriers for members of marginalized communities. While access to
health insurance is not necessarily a barrier for Harvard’s students of color,
BGLTQ+ students, or students from low-income backgrounds, such factors continue to limit accessibility of mental health resources.
According to Barbara Lewis, the acting chief of Counseling and
Mental Health Services, only 25 percent of CAMHS clinicians identify as people of color,
while around 40 percent of the College identifies as such. This
disparity is a problem because, according to research
and Harvard student narratives, shared race or ethnicity between patients and clinicians breaks down barriers
that prevent students of color from
seeking professional mental health services. Research shows that clients prefer
clinician of their own race and perceive them somewhat more positively than
other clinicians. Therefore, clients are more likely to complete treatment when
they are matched with clinicians of their same race or ethnicity. Despite
initiatives to ensure quality health services to low-income and minority
students, including health insurance and CAMHS’s special focus on “women’s
mental health,” without clinicians who share similar worldviews, values, and
experiences, many marginalized students are left unable
to access quality mental health services tailored to their
particular experiences on Harvard’s campus.
On its website, CAMHS does not provide students the option to select
a clinician based on minority identity or identities. Many students also feel that UHS has failed to
make substantial systemic changes despite student outcry, leading us to wonder
whether the mental health of marginalized students is as much of a priority as
that of the perceived norm of the white, cis, heterosexual, socioeconomically
privileged Harvard student. We call on CAMHS to actively pursue clinicians who
can understand and advocate for marginalized students. CAMHS must hire
individuals who represent a broader spectrum of identities, and be supported
and rewarded for their excellence, so they do not actively seek positions with
more support and less pressure elsewhere.
We call on the Harvard administration to dedicate more funds to
the development and refinement of mental health services for marginalized
students. Columbia University’s current counseling and psychological services enable
students to select clinicians based on areas of special interest, including
trauma support, BGLTQ+, religious or spiritual concerns, multicultural concerns,
and body image and eating disorders. The diversity, accessibility, and transparency
of these resources should be similarly reflected in CAMHS staff and services.
We also want transparency about the reallocation of funds from the closing of
the Stillman Infirmary. If financial constraints are an obstacle for hiring
more diverse CAMHS staff, we suggest implementing a capital campaign for the
improvement of mental health services of marginalized students or implementing Columbia University’s fundraising strategy,
which calls for increasing student health fees by 7.5 percent.
Lastly, we call on students, faculty, and staff to join us in
demanding a reflection of marginalized students’ experiences, culture, and
identity in CAMHS staff and services. Students can complete an ongoing survey we are conducting to collect quantitative and qualitative data about
experiences with CAMHS. We ask that faculty and staff hold conversations on and
in the spaces over which they hold power and reflect on the ways in which they
can better support minority and marginalized students.
We, Diversify CAMHS,  in coalition with a wide range of student cultural and affinity organizations, call on Counseling and Mental Health Services to ensure
equal access to and quality of mental health services for marginalized and
minority Harvard students. Now is the time to support all students. Diversify
Counseling and Mental Health Services.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the semester winds down and winter vacation tantalizingly approaches, so too does the release of a blast from the past: “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” a reminder of childhood memories featuring light saber fights in the yard and attempts to blow up the Death Star from a high-flying cockpit on the swing set. Typically, events like the release of a long-awaited movie from a favorite franchise are the kind of historic moments that people pay attention to in their daily lives. After all, the last Star Wars film, “Revenge of the Sith” came out 10 years ago, and the very first was released 38 years ago when my parents were about my age. So, in a non-trivial sense, the release of the new Star Wars movie is a historic event, and it has been generating the attention one would expect.
Recently, however, movie history has not been the only kind of history holding the public imagination. In fact, as the author of a column whose main thesis is that looking to history is useful to glean ideas for present day problems, I have been pleasantly surprised by the past’s recent resurgence.
An obvious area in which the past has come back with a vengeance is in the ongoing debates at many universities over symbols and names. Here at Harvard, the Law School crest is currently the most hot-button issue, but other names will undoubtedly come next: Mather House for its namesake’s slave ownership, Lowell for that University President’s vicious treatment of Jews, blacks, and gay people. Even the first John Winthrop of “City upon a hill” fame had a role in establishing slavery in Harvard’s backyard. Yale continues to wrestle with having one of its residential colleges named after one of the most pro-slavery politicians in American history, John C. Calhoun. And, perhaps most extraordinarily, at Princeton, the usually inviolable Woodrow Wilson is coming under fire for his well-documented racism.
Historians are often wary about renaming campaigns, and they are for good reason. But just because the names of the buildings and institutions rattled off above should probably stay does not mean that the debates they are sparking are not worth having. On the contrary, these discussions illuminate portions of forgotten history that deserve better memorialization. One of the more intriguing proposals put forward in the Wilson debate at Princeton came from New York University visiting associate professor Nathan Connolly, who suggested keeping the name of the Wilson School but adding a monument to Wilson’s questionably conceived intervention in Haiti in a prominent location.
These kinds of dual remembrances are particularly appealing because they avoid the very mistakes that led certain histories to be remembered and others forgotten. People in the 1930s thought that naming a residential college after John Calhoun was an obvious decision because of a deliberately distorted historical memory. As University President Drew G. Faust paraphrased the brilliant historian John Hope Franklin in a recent essay on his life, “an understanding of history destroys innocence.” Remembering history well and seeing its aftershocks in present day violence and inequality is jarring; but forgetting it or creating false narratives of the kind that Franklin explored about the Civil War merely perpetuates injustices.
President Faust concludes her essay by posing several questions. One is aimed directly at her peers: “Are we as historians committed—and prepared—to seize this responsibility to extend history beyond the academy?” In a world where Donald Trump believes he can justify a policy of religious exclusion based on a passing reference to World War II era executive orders, a true engagement with the realities of America’s racial past, with scholarly rigor and an eye toward the future, seems long overdue.
In other areas of study, academics are already putting historical thinking to good use in a similar manner. The Kennedy School’s Graham T. Allison, for example, is conducting a project named after his famous concept of the Thucydides Trap. The central question of this venture is a pressing one: Will China’s challenge to the U.S.’s global dominance produce a war? To find the answer—or possible answers—Allison has studied 16 cases in which “a major rising power threatened to displace a major ruling power.” The results are sobering: in 12, war was the result. But in the remaining four, Allison sees hope for managing the inevitable frictions between Washington and Beijing.
This example from the world of international relations may not seem immediately applicable to discussions of race, but it underscores the way in which careful historical study can illuminate the full measure of present problems. Just as the worlds of 1945 and 1914 are far from being too distant to provide lessons for the conduct of today’s foreign affairs, the worlds of the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Progressive Era, the Jim Crow South, and the Civil Rights Era are crucial for understanding racial and economic injustice in the United States today. One need only look at the chaos in the Middle East or the protests on America’s streets, to paraphrase Tupac, to see the relevance of these disparate episodes to today’s world.
Which brings us back to Star Wars. When last we left Han Solo and Chewbacca, they had defeated the Galactic Empire and killed lots of stormtroopers. Judging by the trailers for “The Force Awakens,” it looks like at least the latter half of that equation is back. History, it seems, just won’t end in the galaxy far, far away, to the glee of moviegoers everywhere. For better or for worse, it won’t in this galaxy either—so we’d better do our best to understand it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, students and staff critical of race relations at Harvard Law School issued a long list of demands to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, insisting that she present a “strategic plan” for their implementation by 9 a.m. last Monday morning. When that unreasonable timeline was unmet, more than 100 students gathered to protest her supposed failure to address their concerns.
The demands, made by a newly organized group called Reclaim Harvard Law School, are for major institutional changes—including, among others, the removal of the Harvard Law School seal, establishment of a critical race theory program, and mandatory “serious study into the implications of racism, white supremacy, and imperialism in creating and perpetuating legal analysis and thought”—that cannot be met in a weekend. They can’t even be considered properly in that timeline.
So let’s consider them now. Some, such as the improvement of financial aid, are meaningful goals that the Law School would do well to aim toward. Others, like the creation of a “committee on diversity and inclusion,” seem benign on their faces, though Reclaim Harvard Law School’s stipulations that the 10 of the 20 members be students and that all members “must be individuals who share…an awareness of problems of inequality and non-inclusion” seem suspect.
And then there are those demands that are truly concerning, even beyond the misguided but ultimately symbolic movement to remove the Harvard Law School seal: the insistence on revising curricula to meet a preconceived ideological agenda. The group seeks to impose a mandatory first-year course on all students that would address “racial justice and inequality in the law,” as well as “implicit bias/cultural competency training” at the start of the year.
Other proposals are similarly off the mark. The insistence that Harvard Law professors, often the top practitioners in their fields, be taught how to properly “contextualize” their material and that student evaluations include questions on whether faculty “contextualize” their lectures properly smacks of overbearing academic regulation. Add to that the demand that a newly established Office of Diversity and Inclusion have “a full and equal seat at the table for all discussions and decisions on curricular changes,” and a full-fledged threat to academic freedom forms.
After the recent vandalism of portraits of black professors, it’s clear that issues of race still continue at the Law School. But vilifying Minow for not immediately acceding to all these demands in a weekend solves little.
In an email to affiliates Monday, Minow described the Law School as “a community of many voices and hopes,” going on to write that the school has “an obligation to provide and protect the opportunity for all to participate, speak and be heard.”         Hers is the right attitude.
Progress may be a duty on us all, but it must happen deliberately, with due consideration of consequences. Academic freedom is too important to sacrifice, even in the name of a cause as important as racial equality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, 60 percent of American millennials now support sending ground troops to fight the Islamic State, according to results from a biannual Institute of Politics poll of young Americans released Thursday morning. Only 48 percent supported sending ground troops in polling earlier this fall, and the question was re-fielded after the attacks.
The 28th edition of the poll surveyed just over 2,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 about their views on the Islamic State, the American dream, and the upcoming presidential election. The interviews were conducted between late October and early November, so the results do not reflect Republican candidate Donald Trump’s recent controversial statement about temporarily banning Muslims from entering the United States.
The IOP poll found that, despite majority support for ground troops in Syria, less than 20 percent of millennials are willing to serve if asked.
“Traditionally [millennials have] been very resistant to this. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not popular among young people... In large part, I think it’s because this group of people grew up after the war in Iraq really made an impression,” said Ellen T. Robo ’16, student chair of the Public Opinion Project, which conducted the survey with the guidance of IOP director of polling John Della Volpe.
Young Americans, according to the poll results, place integrity, level-headedness, and authenticity as the most important attributes in a future president, above political experience.
Poll data about the upcoming elections shows that Republicans are losing ground among young voters. A majority—56 percent—wants Democrats to maintain control of the White House, a net increase of 5 percentage points from the spring edition of the poll.
“That doesn’t necessarily mean that Democrats are becoming more popular, but what we see overall right now is that Republicans are becoming less popular,” said Dustin Chiang ’19, whose work on the project focused on the Republican primary race.
Trump led the pack of Republican candidates, with 22 percent saying they would vote for him if the primaries were held today. However, only 38 percent of young Republican voters believe he is qualified to be president.
Trump’s push to build a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico was another topic included in the poll. Seventy percent of young Republicans support building a wall, compared to 31 percent of Democrats.
“Young people look more like the rest of Americans,” Volpe said. “In the last four or five years, we’ve seen them become more polarized. Democrats are moving further to the left; Republicans are moving further to the right.”
As for Democrats between the ages of 18 and 29, there has been a surge of support for Bernie Sanders since the spring poll, when just 1 percent supported him. Now 41 percent do, compared to 35 percent for Hillary Clinton.
Fifty-three percent of Democrats in college support Sanders, while only 19 percent support Clinton.
There is also now a nearly even split between young people who believe the American dream is alive, and those who believe it is dead. A majority of both Trump’s and Sanders’ supporters believe it is dead—that is not the case for supporters of any other candidates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 13, 2015, at 4:02 p.m.
Every August, roughly 400 incoming freshmen line up on Widener Library’s 100-year-old steps, awaiting word of which peers they will join on the hiking trail for their trip with Harvard’s oldest pre-orientation program. They will soon spend a week backpacking, canoeing, or doing outdoor service projects with upperclassman leaders of the First-Year Outdoor Program, their official introduction to the College before they move into the Yard.
According to tradition, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 speaks to the group before they take off. He realizes something, though, about the group of students congregated each year.
“When I look out at the group on the night we welcome them when they’re on the steps of Widener, it’s fair to say that they don’t look like the whole class,” Dingman said.
Harvard touts its pre-orientation programs as its way of introducing incoming freshmen to the College’s campus in a more intimate and controlled setting than the class-wide week of orientation called Opening Days. Pre-orientation programs set the tone of the first-year experience at Harvard for their hundreds of participants and are often the place where students make long-lasting friendships and their first impressions of the campus they will soon join.
FOP specifically frames its mission as a source of social support for incoming students; in a statement, leaders described the program’s goals as helping freshmen develop connections with both peers and older students and a full picture of Harvard’s resources and the diversity of its students’ experiences.
The program struggles, though, with representing that diversity fully. Black and Latino students are underrepresented in FOP, and while program leaders have made strides to encourage more minority students to participate through mechanisms such as financial aid, they acknowledge that they still have work to do. FOP is tasked with developing creative solutions to attract a base of participants that has, until now, strayed away from the program.
A BACKGROUND OF BARRIERS
Leaders of FOP’s steering committee both past and present are candid about the struggles they face in addressing the dearth of diversity within the program, citing a score of both institutional and social barriers as obstacles of closing that gap.
According to Paul R. “Coz” Teplitz ’03-’09, who has served as FOP’s director for five years, the program does not gather data on the cultural or ethnic backgrounds of its participants for privacy reasons. But in the absence of data, FOP leaders identify the problem anecdotally. Teplitz acknowledges that certain groups are historically not represented in the program. 
“We would be surprising no one if we said that certain groups tend not to be represented in the FOP community as much as they are represented in the Harvard community,” Teplitz said. “Specifically, we tend to have rather white or rather Asian participants and not to have not that many of Latino/Latina descent, or [many] black individuals.”
Program leaders and administrators cite a myriad of reasons to explain why some groups of students are more represented than others. Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director for freshman programming who oversees FOP, cited a Freshman Dean’s Office survey from three years ago: According to that survey,  most students who did not participate in any pre-orientation programs named prior summer engagements or an interest in staying home for an extra week before college as eclipsing other reasons.
Still, hundreds of students do come to campus early, but underrepresented minority students in that group still do not tend to flock to FOP.
Dingman and Steele cite student interest in the outdoors as a large factor in the origin of FOP’s diversity problem. Teplitz noted that the National Park Service has tried to make the outdoors more appealing to minorities when it historically has not been. A New York Times op-ed this year described park goers as a homogenous breed: “white and aging.” 
There is also the cost factor. FOP will charge students $430 to participate in 2016, and although it offers financial aid and free equipment to those who need it, students have an option of making money through Dorm Crew, the only pre-orientation program that offers to pay its students and leaders for participating. For students on a budget, that is especially steep competition.
“Even if there’s no financial barrier, there’s an opportunity cost,” said Miles U. Graham ’16, who has led FOP trips since his sophomore year.
“It’s a program that is expensive and doesn’t appeal to everyone,” Dingman added.
Graham said FOP faces a two-headed problem—addressing minority representation within the leader corps by encouraging people without explicit interest in the outdoors to join the program and removing any barriers that would preclude students from doing FOP.
“In every single leadership position, if you don’t see a role model that looks like you, you aren’t going to feel welcomed,” Graham said.
Program leaders and others at the College say that diversity in pre-orientation programs like FOP matters. A recent report on diversity at the College argues that those programs “provide a shared institutional vocabulary and robust engagement with issues of diversity and cultures of inclusion” at Harvard and “enable attention to the needs of underrepresented students, especially those who are first generation and socio-economically disadvantaged, while fostering community for the entire population across lines of difference.”
To Steele, a lack of diversity among FOP participants dilutes the impact of the program.
“Part of the value of coming to Harvard is the high amount of diversity that we have, so any time that you have a situation where it’s not as reflective and representative of the class as it could be, then you’re missing out on something,” Steele said. “Everyone is missing out on something.”
EXPANDING AID
Assailed as they are with a number of challenges keeping them from diversifying, FOP has, in recent years, spearheaded major efforts to compensate for those barriers. FOP’s answer to the conundrum of incentivizing minority participation in the program is a robust financial aid program.
“That’s a big, sort of incredibly practical solution,” Steele said.
FOP’s steering committee has set its sights on smashing financial barriers for its participants. Taking their cues largely from Princeton, which instituted a school-funded financial aid program to accommodate the costs of their Outdoor Action program before suspending student fees altogether, FOP has provided participants financial aid at the same proportion as their Harvard aid packages throughout the past few years.
“That was something we were really psyched about because, obviously, financial consideration is something that is a barrier to people thinking of joining FOP,” Jacob C. Barton ’17  said.
In 2015, FOP gave 43 percent of its participants direct financial aid, distributing $57,250 total. This number is a more than $25,000 increase compared to the previous year, because program leaders upped their fundraising efforts. FOP gave some students—187 of its 393 participants, some on financial aid and others not—free gear rental as well.
Teplitz cites Princeton’s Outdoor Action program as an example of the power financial aid has on the makeup of outdoor pre-orientation programs. FOP used data from Princeton’s program to conceptualize their financial aid program.
“That data strongly suggests that making additional money available affects people’s choices on whether or not to do pre-orientation,” Teplitz said. “They were essentially a program that got a lot of money in one year and, going forward, within a few years the makeup of their program changed from being skewed to people who aren’t on aid, to matching the university's financial aid program.”
Funding for the financial aid program comes largely from three sources: donations from program alumni, the parents of FOP participants, and the parents of FOP leaders. FOP reaches out to potential donors using fundraising letters crafted by participants of the program, who share their individual experiences.
In the past, FOP has explored other funding sources for their financial aid initiative, looking to the University for funding. For the last several years, the Freshman Dean’s Office has made that funding requests through its yearly budget proposal, according to Steele, but has not had much success.
Sheila C. Thimba, the College’s dean for administration and finance, said Harvard has not used budgetary funds to supplement FOP’s program in the past, but administrators have been discussing whether to use discretionary dollars from the dean’s budget to help fund the financial aid initiative.
FROM THE INSIDE, OUT
Despite their goals of increasing the reach of financial aid, FOP leaders acknowledge that the program alone will not be enough to flesh out the makeup of their participant pool, prompting them to discuss other potential solutions.
One of those solutions is increasing the diversity of their own staff.
“Definitely something we are trying our best to actively think about and take steps towards is this goal that we see as making any FOPer that goes on FOP feel like they can see their personal background experience mirrored in someone in the leader community,” said Barton, one of the members of FOP’s steering committee. “Ideally, our leader community and our program is representative of any type of background that an incoming student might have, and therefore might identify with in a leader.”
Creating this diverse leadership background means attracting students who normally would not see FOP as a viable extracurricular experience. Students who either did not have outdoor experience before freshman year or did not participate in FOP for pre-orientation typically do not seek to join the program’s leadership ranks. The lynchpin of FOP’s publicizing efforts is to make sure students know that experience is not necessary to be accepted into the program, and leaders hope to increase FOP’s exposure through social media and their visibility on campus as a community-oriented group.
Additionally, Graham said pre-orientation programs at some peer schools have made the switch to paying their student leaders for their services. FOP might be able to attract students who elect to continue summer jobs, or work for Dorm Crew, to instead lead program excursions, Graham suggested, if it followed suit.
“My vision for FOP is that you can apply to be paid for the two weeks you train or lead FOP if that’s a concern for you,” Graham said.
In the meantime, as they still try to increase the diversity of their participant and leader corps, every FOP leader bridges the topic of campus diversity during their trips with incoming freshmen. FOP’s steering committee requires that leaders hold at least one structured discussion about diversity on their trips, but leaves the format of that discussion up to trip leaders.
On her trip, FOP leader Jenny Choi ’16 facilitated an activity this past year called “included, excluded,” asking students to share stories about a time when they had felt either included or excluded. The goal is to discuss diversity issues. While she was satisfied with how her group received the activity, in retrospect Choi said she would now approach it so that it would better address “a lot of the pressing real-time issues with diversity head on.”
“It was sort of going around them by pretty much opening it up to anything and everything,” said Choi, who writes a column for The Crimson’s editorial board. “You could say that you felt excluded when you didn’t make tryouts, or something.”
Moving forward, Choi said FOP should solidify a universal curriculum for diversity discussions to make sure conversations are well constructed and received. Teplitz said FOP may need to rely on the help of campus organizations and affinity groups to adequately frame those discussions.
FOP has previously collaborated with the Harvard College Women’s Center to train its leaders on gender issues. But it has not recently reached out to affinity groups to recruit from their ranks, according to FOP leader Lynn Miao ’16. Leaders have discussed reaching out to student affinity groups for feedback on how the program might address its issues with diversity, said Miao, who is a former Crimson Blog chair.
Program leaders agree that fixing its diversity problem will be a collaborative effort. As students on colleges nationwide debate diversity issues and the experiences of minority students, FOP will need to continue to think critically to develop creative solutions to diversifying its leader and participant populations, they say.
“A big part of the dialogue is acknowledging that we have to work extra hard [to ensure] that the outdoors is not a white space, and that it’s a space for everyone, and also we have to work extra hard to make sure that people know the outdoors is an accessible space,” Graham said.
To Choi, discussing the issue itself is imperative.
“It carries a lot of racial and socioeconomic weight, and I think part of it is to be forthright and honest about that,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To a crowd of more than 40 undergraduates, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana fielded student criticisms on the state of diversity programming on campus and promised Wednesday night to implement short-term initiatives outlined in a recent report on diversity at the College.
On a short-term basis, Khurana said he will immediately allocate funding for students to invite more diverse speakers to the College and work to study more developed mentorship programs between students, faculty, and recent alumni of color. He also outlined longer term goals, such as increasing diversity among Harvard’s faculty and creating more course offerings that focus on topics of diversity.
Khurana emphasized the exigencies of these issues in light of rampant national controversy over the state of institutional diversity at campuses and recent legal challenges to race-based affirmative action at Harvard and other schools. He called the plaintiff’s argument in a high profile U.S. Supreme Court case challenging the University of Texas at Austin’s use of race-based affirmative action—which began oral arguments hours before the town hall—as an affront against Harvard’s “fundamental project.”
“I don’t want to miss this window,” Khurana said. “I feel a sense of urgency around this, but also a sense of propping up that window, that this is not something that we can just be superficial about.”
Khurana framed the town hall as a chance for undergraduates to voice opposition to or support for specific recommendations in a comprehensive report from a College working group tasked with assessing the state of diversity programming and the experiences of minority students on campus. Released in late November, the 37-page report calls on administrators to bolster training around student life issues, augment the accessibility and diversity of course offerings, and promote diversity among the College’s faculty and disciplinary bodies. University President Drew G. Faust has already accepted a recommendation by creating a University-wide task force to study issues of diversity.
 At the forum on Wednesday, undergraduates alternated offering commentary on the report, and some were skeptical of administrators’ proposed timeline for implementing the report’s recommendations.
Tiffany M. Ramos ’16 asked whether administrators would change the College’s core curriculum, which was recently deemed “failing on a variety of fronts” and is now under review, to require students to take a course on gender, ethnic, or cultural studies. The College’s diversity working group reviewed current curricular offerings and found that less than 4 percent of all courses “substantially and critically with issues of diversity and inclusion,” according to a handout distributed at the meeting.
Administrators hope to increase courses that focus on race and diversity and more publicly display them in online search tools, said Brandon M. Terry ’05, a co-author of the diversity report and an assistant professor of African and African American Studies and Social Studies.
Other students criticized the breadth of the diversity recommendations, arguing that administrators failed to adequately include commentary on some student experiences.
Anwar Omeish ’19 said she saw little representation of Arab American students in the report, which is geared toward creating a more inclusive campus environment for all students of color.
“The discussion on inclusion excluded me,” Omeish said. “I don’t see Arab Americans being thought about in any way.”
William A. Greenlaw ’17, a representative on the Undergraduate Council, said he was concerned that creating more committees on diversity and inclusion may be counter-intuitive to the underlying goals of the report. Specifically, Greenlaw highlighted the formation of the University-wide diversity task force, in addition to the working group at the College level.
“I worry that… we miss opportunities to take meaningful action right now,” Greenlaw said. “How will you ensure that the formation of more discourse and more committees like these don’t prevent the University from being more proactive in attacking the issues that they say will be done in the short term?”
Terry responded generally to students and encouraged all people at the meeting to act seriously toward affirming a University-wide commitment to diversity.
“If we don’t continue to push this in every way, it will fail, and there are enemies to this project,” he said.
Some students criticized the tone of ongoing campus debates.
Tyler Jenkins ’19 said Harvard affiliates should debate the calls for administrators to remove or alter symbols that are associated with slavery or other historical atrocities. The College’s House masters recently agreed unanimously to change their title after some students said the name conveyed ties to slavery. Some Harvard Law School students, meanwhile, are demanding that administrators change the school’s seal because of its connections to a slaveholding family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though some undergraduates say they are on the whole satisfied with a new proposal to overhaul the College’s General Education program, others have expressed skepticism and say students were not adequately consulted during the review process. 
If implemented, the proposal would attempt to address issues with the current Gen Ed program—deemed “failing on a variety of fronts”—by requiring that students take four classes under new categories, in addition to a quantitative reasoning course and one class in each division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Some undergraduates said they support the divisional requirement, which would allow students to choose from a broader spectrum of courses not necessarily limited to the Gen Ed categories.
“It seems to me that students will be able to take a wider range of courses to fulfill each of the requirements, which I definitely think is a great idea,” said William A. Greenlaw ’17, an Undergraduate Council representative from Pforzheimer House. “It’s more flexible [for students] to take coursework that they’re interested in.”
According to UC Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18, he and his colleagues on the committee have been working closely with the faculty members tasked with revamping the program.
“All throughout the process, students have been involved in voicing feedback,” Ely said.
He added that students had the opportunity to attend four town hall meetings held last year on the review, and emphasized continued communication between UC members and Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, who chairs the Gen Ed review committee. That committee began its work more than 18 months ago, and has since consulted with the broader FAS faculty to create its proposal.
Some students who are not members of the UC, however, said they felt disconnected from the review process. Jordan M. Donald ’18 said the review seems to be going smoothly, but said he wished students had played a larger role in crafting the proposal.
“As a sophomore it was definitely news to me; it would have been nice to do an entire school poll or something like that,” Donald said. “The town hall meetings are nice but those are hard to get to.”
Though Nora P. O’Neill ’18 also viewed the proposal itself positively, she said she was unaware of any student involvement in the review process.
“I do think that when students aren’t involved in some part... the student experience is missing,” O’Neill said.
Several other students said they were either unaware that new proposals had been made or were unsure how the new program would work if  implemented.
Ryan M. Ward ’18 said he does not know if the new program will give Gen Ed a clearer identity. In earlier stages of the review, faculty raised concerns that the current program holds no identity at the College.
“It is hard to say how it will shape up without seeing what the new courses will look like,” said Ward. “I still feel like it’ll still be pretty arbitrary what counts for Gen Ed and what doesn’t.”
Yvenna Chen ’17 questioned the “flexibility” in student course selection that the proposal seems to advocate.
“There are still eight requirements when you break it down," she said. "And it honestly doesn’t sound that different to me."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted on a resolution several weeks ago condemning Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 for his public statement against the state allowing Syrian refugees to enter. Meanwhile, at Harvard, students have organized events over the past week to support refugees.
Following terrorist attacks in Paris in November, Baker joined 30 other governors in announcing that they would not accept refugees in their states, citing security concerns. However, governors do not have the constitutional authority to bar refugees from entering their states.
The issue became local on Nov. 23, when the Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a resolution opposing Baker’s comments and calling on Cambridge residents to take in refugees. Many Harvard students across party lines said they support the Council vote.
“As a Massachusetts native I was disappointed to hear that Governor Baker has refused to accept Syrian refugees,” Susan X. Wang ’17, the incoming president of the Harvard Democrats, wrote in an email. “The Cambridge City Council's vote against his statement is an important one, both because we have an obligation to help those fleeing a humanitarian crisis, and because it represents a rejection of the increasingly anti-Muslim rhetoric that surrounds this issue.”
John S. Acton ’17, a member of the Harvard Republican Club, also condemned Baker’s stance on refugees, since he believes current refugee screening practices are sufficiently rigorous. However, he said he found the City Council vote unnecessary, as Baker does not have the authority to reject refugees. He also took issue with the rhetoric used against Baker at the Council meeting.
“I think there’s room for people to legitimately disagree on the issue, but I don’t think that makes Governor Baker a hateful person,” he said.
Beyond supporting the Council resolution, some Harvard students are taking action themselves to help refugees. Syrian student Tala Atassi ’18 co-founded the Harvard College Syrian Humanitarian League last year to raise money and support for the cause. The League held a benefit concert last weekend to raise funds specifically for refugee children, and Atassi said the group is planning another event in the spring in collaboration with the Institute of Politics.
The International Relations Council held a community meeting Wednesday for College and high school students in the Harvard Program for International Education. The aim of the event was to discuss solutions to the refugee crisis and equip attendees with strategies for contacting their congressional representatives to urge them to support refugees.
“We felt that we’ve seen a lot of informational events, but what’s been lacking is action response,” said Sophia Lugo ’17, IRC chief strategist, who helped organize the event. “We tried to get people to see the problem as a personal issue. This is not just a policy issue, these are real people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of students, Harvard Club workers, and Unite Here Local 26 union representatives presented University Provost Alan M. Garber '76 with a petition on Thursday to revoke the Harvard Club of Boston’s right to use Harvard’s name in light of ongoing disputes over a new contract currently under negotiation.
The Harvard Club, a private business not affiliated with the University but serving Harvard alumni and graduates of selected affiliate schools, has been engaged in contract renegotiations with workers and representatives of Local 26 since earlier this year. Local 26 serves Boston’s hotel and food service workers, and represents the Harvard Club’s staff.
The petition, which members of the Student Labor Action Movement said garnered more than 300 signatures on Facebook and on campus, comes union and club representatives over dispute points of the proposed contract, including health care benefits and pension plans.
According to Henry M. Gomory ’17, a member of SLAM who helped with coordination efforts, impetus for the petition came from language on the website of the Office of the Provost which regulates the use of Harvard’s name to “promote the purposes of the University.”
“It comes out of thinking about, as students, what our role is in maintaining Harvard’s name,” Gomory said.
Members of SLAM met with workers to “hear about the main issues they were having” before drafting the petition, Gomory said.
“It really draws directly from the workers,” said Gomory, who emphasized SLAM’s focus on “making sure we have direct communication with the people we are advocating for, and that what we’re advocating for comes directly from their concerns.”
Yet there is dispute over the accuracy of some claims made in the petition.
Harvard Club spokesperson Diana C. Pisciotta wrote in an emailed statement that while the club “respect[s] the Harvard student group SLAM’s desire to assure that the University’s name is represented well by affiliated organizations…we believe their concern may be misfounded.”
The petition states that the health care plan proposed in negotiations would include “higher copays [and] higher deductibles,” resulting in “shifting costs onto the backs of workers,” an issue that has been of ongoing concern to Harvard Club workers and union organizers.
But Pisciotta maintained that the proposed plan includes no deductibles and lower premiums that, according to her, the club is “confident” would result in lower out-of-pocket costs for employees.
Local 26 organizer Tiffany Ten Eyck said these assertions do not account for members who use the plan with high frequency or include family members on their insurance plans.
“Workers do feel like it would be more expensive for them in the long run,” Ten-Eyck said. “What [the Harvard Club is] disregarding or misrepresenting is that when folks use the plan a lot it ends up being more costly.”
Charles E. Sileski, a union member who has worked at the Harvard Club for 13 years and is also a member of the negotiation committee, said he is “worried” about the proposed health insurance plan. Sileski’s two daughters and wife, who requires frequent care, are also on his health insurance plan.
Another main point of contention raised by the petition is employee pension plans, which were suspended but maintained at their current levels in 2012’s contract. Now, the Harvard Club is proposing a replacement of the pension plan with a 401k structure, which union representative Lila N. Goldstein says union members oppose.
“I don’t want to be afraid, I’m getting older and older each year,” Sileski said of the 401k plan. “I want to make sure my family is taken care of.”
The petition, which requests that Garber deny the Club’s right to use Harvard’s name if the cited issues are not addressed by Feb. 1, and to meet with community members to discuss the issues, was co-sponsored and presented by representatives from a variety of student groups including SLAM, the Harvard Democrats, Divest Harvard, the Progressive Jewish Alliance, the Harvard Islamic Society, the International Women’s Rights Collective, and the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee.
Members from student groups met with workers and union representatives outside of Massachusetts Hall, where workers expressed concerns about the negotiations and proposed contract changes before a student and a Harvard Club worker delivered the petition inside.

Just 14.8 percent of the 6,173 early applicants to Harvard College’s Class of 2020 received acceptance emails on Thursday afternoon, marking the lowest early acceptance rate since Harvard reinstated its early action program in 2011.
While the size of the early action pool increased slightly—about 4.3 percent larger than last year—the acceptance rate fell 1.7 percent, with 918 students receiving offers of admission. 
Although Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the admissions department does not set a numerical quota for early action acceptances, he added that admissions officers are careful to leave room in the class for applicants from the regular cycle.
When deciding to admit a student during the early cycle, “we want to be not 99 percent certain, but 100 percent certain that we would also admit the person later,” Fitzsimmons said.
Of those not admitted to the class, 4,673 students were deferred to the regular cycle, while 464 were denied admission, 12 withdrew, and 106 submitted incomplete applications.
Fitzsimmons also cautioned against the notion that applying early would bolster a student’s odds of admission, instead attributing the higher acceptance rate for early applicants to the stronger applicant pool during the early cycle. Last year, the Class of 2019 saw a 2.8 percent regular acceptance rate after an early action cycle that accepted 16.5 percent of applicants.
Of those admitted early to the Class of 2020, 24.2 percent identify as Asian American, a 1.5 percent increase from last year’s early cycle. The percentages of the pool comprised of African American and Latino students admitted each fell slightly, to 9.4 and 9.6 percent respectively from 10.3 and 11.4 percent last year. In addition, 1.8 percent of accepted students identify as Native American and Native Hawaiian.
Of the accepted students, 47.4 percent identify as female, marking a slight decrease from last year’s near-parity in the early pool.
Although Fitzsimmons was unable to provide a precise figure for the number of students who would apply for financial aid, he said that 11.4 percent of admitted students requested a fee waiver for their application and 10.1 percent were first-generation college students, up from 9.5 percent last year. Fitzsimmons declined to comment on the number of legacy students admitted to the class.
The number of accepted students indicating interest in the humanities increased slightly to 16.7 percent from 14.8 percent last year, which Fitzsimmons credits to the division’s new Theater, Dance, and Media concentration, the reopening of the Harvard Art Museums, and what he called the College’s “special effort to double down on the humanities.” The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences also saw an increase in prospective concentrators, up to 11.1 percent from 9.4 percent last year.
Meanwhile, the number of students indicating interest in the social sciences fell four percentage points to 24.4 percent this year. Fitzsimmons said that the decline was likely due to surging interest in the humanities and engineering, and added that he had heard “not even one mention” of concern for the quality of Harvard’s social science programs.
The Crimson was granted early access to admissions figures and an interview with Fitzsimmons under the condition that it not publish the story until Friday morning. Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, sat in on the interview via conference call.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard Law School students continue to advocate for a list of demands they say will improve the school’s treatment of minority students, a group of 25 Law faculty and staff published a letter Wednesday commending the student activism.
Last Friday, a group of Law School students, now called “Reclaim Harvard Law School,” demanded that Law School Dean Martha L. Minow institute a number of changes to the school’s curriculum and culture. While the professors did not directly endorse the demands—which range from establishing an independent office of diversity and inclusion to changing the school’s controversial seal—they praised the student efforts. 
“Complacency is not an option. We are ready to work with students and staff in an immediate, concrete and informed process or assessment and reform,” the professors, lecturers, and staff members wrote. “The current activism presents us with an opportunity that lovers of justice cannot afford to squander.”
In the past few months, discussions of racism at the Law School have dominated campus discourse.
A racially-charged incident involving pieces of black tape placed over the portraits of black faculty members in late November intensified student demands that administrators improve the school’s treatment of minority students. On Monday, students held a rally to protest what they described as Minow’s inadequate response to their demands.
Minow met with some students Wednesday evening, according to Michelle B. Deakin, a Law School spokesperson, and some students said they discussed their demands with the dean.  Minow has already taken some steps to respond to student demands, including creating a committee to reconsider the school’s seal.
The Law faculty and staff were not the only ones commenting on the recent developments at the Law School—another group of students launched a website called “Responsible Speech at HLS” that is critical of some aspects of Reclaim Harvard Law School’s demands. The online letter, supported by 16 signatories, most anonymous, argues that some of the demands—like curriculum change—could stifle academic freedom and discourage alternative viewpoints.
“We think some of the demands would have a chilling effect on dialogue and would actually be unproductive,” said William H. Barlow, a Law student who helped launch the site.
In an emailed statement, Alexander J. Clayborne, a third-year Law student, said he and student activists were encouraged by the faculty and staff’s letter, which was posted on the website of the Systemic Justice Project. Clayborne declined to comment on the “Responsible Speech at HLS” letter.
“[We] are very excited to see support among the faculty, lecturers, instructors, and senior staff. We'll be working to build more support in the future,” Clayborne wrote.
Janet E. Halley, one of the Law School professors who signed the open letter, said she is thankful to the student activists for changing campus discourse.
“We’ve been having a lot of conversations about racial inclusion and diversity at the Law School this fall thanks to the student movement,” Halley said. “We’re going to continue to do that through the rest of the year, and this is an effort by some members of the teaching community at the Law School to convey that we’re grateful for the way that they’ve brought the issues forward.”

This is Part I in a two-part series on The Crimson’s survey on College residential life. Part II will run on Monday.
The majority of students who responded to a recent Crimson survey—84 percent—say they are satisfied overall with their experiences living in their upperclassman Houses, but their experiences in those on-campus residences vary.
For example, while students in Cabot and Currier Houses—located in the Radcliffe Quad, farther away from Harvard Square—reported feeling slightly more satisfied with their living experiences than their peers on average, those respondents were much less excited when they learned of their housing assignments their freshman year.
According to the survey, 48 percent of respondents reported feeling very satisfied with their House, while 36 percent said they are somewhat satisfied. Eight percent reported feeling neutral, 5 percent somewhat satisfied, and 3 percent not at all satisfied.
Of all the Houses, respondents from Lowell House they were most satisfied (91 percent), followed by Adams, Quincy, Currier , and Cabot. Respondents from Winthrop House, meanwhile, reported the lowest overall rate of satisfaction, which still totaled 77 percent. 
Though all of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses—each home to between 350 and 500 upperclassmen— offer students dining, advising, and programming resources, each House varies in its character, traditions, and housing accommodations.
Harvard touts its House system as a cornerstone of student life, but students this year have criticized administrators for what they see as the pitfalls of on-campus social spaces. As students debate the quality of College social life and administrators look to increase the importance of the Houses in upperclassman student life, The Crimson conducted an anonymous survey of Harvard upperclassmen about House and student social life.
Conducted by The Crimson, the survey was emailed to College sophomores, juniors, and seniors on Oct. 25 and closed on Nov. 8, garnering responses from 1,128 students, just under a quarter of upperclassmen. The Crimson did not adjust the survey results for any possible selection bias.
The survey asked upperclassmen dozens of questions on topics ranging from their thoughts on Harvard’s ongoing House renewal project to their experiences on Housing Day, residential advising, and facilities. The results indicate that while students are overall satisfied, they also perceive inequities between Houses.
Just before spring break each year, blocking groups of freshmen receive random assignments to live in one of the College’s 12 Houses for the rest of their time as undergraduates. On festivities known as Housing Day, hundreds of enthusiastic upperclassmen don T-shirts promoting their Houses and storm the Yard, chanting and dancing as they deliver letters to their newest residents.
Overall, most survey respondents—64 percent—said they were excited when they learned what House they were placed in on Housing Day. Thirty-nine percent said they very excited and 25 percent somewhat excited; 15 percent of respondents felt neutral, while 12 percent were not very excited and 8 percent not at all excited. But between Houses, levels of excitement and outlook on Housing Day vary.
As a part of Harvard’s roughly $1 billion House renewal project, parts or all of three Houses have undergone major renovations meant to rethink common spaces and entryways: Quincy’s Stone Hall, Leverett’s McKinlock Hall, and most recently all of Dunster House. Winthrop is slated to undergo construction starting next summer and Lowell House the year after.
But with a mission to revitalize House Life, some students have critiqued the renewal process so far for its changes to existing living arrangements, which move away from private spaces like in-suite bathrooms and toward more open common spaces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sporting towels, sneakers, Santa hats, and not much else, throngs of naked students gathered in Harvard Yard at midnight on Thursday for Primal Scream, the biannual College ritual that marks each semester’s transition from reading period to final exams.
Though last year’s Primal Scream was the site of controversy, with a student protest interrupting proceedings, this year’s was far milder in terms of temperament and temperature.
As midnight neared on Thursday, students began to gather in front of Hollis Hall, many draped in flags and sporting bathrobes. The unseasonably balmy temperature drew a substantial number of “screamers,” the size of the crowd for the biannual tradition tending to expand and shrink in tandem with the weather.
As is tradition, the Harvard University Band provided the soundtrack, playing topical tracks like Bruce Springsteen’s “Born to Run.”
“It’s awesome,” Harvard Band member Robert D. Capodilupo ’19 said of the semesterly tradition that dates back to the 1960s. “This is what makes Harvard, Harvard.”
While the tradition originally consisted solely of frustrated screams from dorm-room windows, the naked lap around Harvard Yard has become a vital part of the ritual since its introduction in the ’90s.
“You did not do Primal Scream. This doesn’t count,” one woman said to a friend who had opted for a bikini over a birthday suit.
The crowd grew rowdier, chants of “USA” intensifying, until midnight provoked a raucous yell and the beginning of a counterclockwise loop around the Yard. Runners passed by a large group of phone-wielding tourists gathered around the John Harvard Statue before circling back to Hollis and making a beeline for their clothing.
Calling the event “awesome,” Primal Scream participant Kayla Phalen ’19 said her “biggest fear was having a lot of tourists take pictures.”
While the massive crowd had largely dispersed five minutes after the run, a sizeable group of revelers stuck lingered outside of Hollis, drawing shouts of “Go Home!” from Hollis Hall windows. One particularly energetic group of around 15 took a second lap at 12:30 a.m., jogging past discarded shoes and the odd empty bottle of Rubinoff.
“They need to put their clothes back on,” Carla Troconis ’19 said. “It’s done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Football is no longer the only sport where you can see a player sprint down the sideline right past the opposition to make a diving catch off of a line-drive toss for the score anymore at Harvard.
Harvard Red Line, the men’s Ultimate Frisbee club team, has used this type of connection to great effect throughout this fall season, one which has developed over the years between co-captain handler Mark Vandenberg and junior co-captain cutter John Stubbs. As a result of the star power these two provide, which complements the addition of newfound depth added by the outstanding play of the team’s younger members, the Red Line has performed up to its own lofty expectations so far this year.
In its first two competitions of the season at Huck a Hunk of Burnin’ Pumpkin in Portsmouth, R.I. and the Classic City Classic in Athens, Ga., the team reached the finals and semifinals, respectively, only to lose to eventual champion, top-ranked University of Massachusetts-Amherst, in both of the tournament matches.
The chemistry between two of the best collegiate players in the country in Vandenberg and Stubbs provides an added element to the squad that many opposing teams are unable to account for. Focusing too much attention on one half of the pair could leave the other one streaking down the sideline without coverage.
“If Mark is the quarterback, John is the star wide receiver,” senior cutter Alex Hem said. “Half the time the offense will start by Mark just immediately hucking it deep to John. And John will just toast his man and make an awesome catch. They’re two really good players who have played a lot together, and it’s sweet to watch.”
Both coming from the same Ultimate Frisbee powerhouse, the Paideia School in Atlanta, and playing for the Boston Ironside on the club circuit, Stubbs and Vandenberg have had ample time together to develop into a force. Their bond has strengthened both on and off the field, and their history together has enabled them to pick up on one another’s tendencies and strategies, resulting in a rapport that is rare and coveted in sports.
“John and I have been friends since we were like six or seven,” Vandenberg said. “I was very happy when he ended up at Harvard because when you play with someone for so long you get a pretty strong sense of the kind of things they like to do and are expecting you to do. Oftentimes it just takes a little nod or hand gesture…for us to know what the other wants.”
Stubbs has a family pedigree when it comes to Ultimate. His older brother, George Stubbs ’11, guided the Red Line to the USA Ultimate College Championships three times in his Crimson career, en route to winning the Callahan (National Player of the Year) Award in his senior season. Meanwhile, his sister India Stubbs ’15, who captained the Harvard women’s team, Quasar, for three years, dominated the women’s side. Frisbee runs in the family and Harvard Ultimate has benefited as a result.
Even though the team is anchored by the play of Vandenberg and Stubbs, the younger players have become productive contributors as well.
With its large freshman class last year, the Red Line was a relatively inexperienced group. However, the vital experience that the team’s young core gained from huge chunks of playing time it received a year ago, in addition to the effort the squad has put in over the recent past has paid dividends this season.
“[Our] sophomores put in a lot of work this summer and it was very clear from their play at both of these tournaments,” Vandenberg said. “[Sophomore cutters] John Rahill and Milan Ravenell stand out as two of those guys, but it was really a top to bottom thing. Our freshmen also were able to step into important roles, which we certainly were not expecting this quickly.”
The team’s upperclassmen leaders have developed a culture of accountability and work ethic in an attempt to bring the squad to new heights and allow new members to more easily adjust to its system. Red Line looks to build a program that will continue to play for years to come, even after the likes of Vandenberg and Stubbs move to higher levels of competition upon their graduation.
Despite its status as a club squad, the Ultimate Frisbee team does not just stand around tossing Frisbees back and forth when practicing, as one might imagine. Practice is by no mean casual, as it may be for other club sports across campus. This semester, especially, the team has placed an emphasis on fundamentals and strength training.
“We’re putting in a lot of work this fall, especially in terms of our fitness, which has taken a step to another level,” Hem said. “We’re working with a varsity trainer this year…and I think that’s given us not only a competitive edge in terms of increased skill and speed, but it’s giving us a lot of confidence going in as well.”
Yet the question remains: How far can this squad go, and can Stubbs help bring the Red Line to nationals as his older brother, George, did before him?
For Hem, the culture of success for Ultimate at Harvard lends an easy answer.
“We feel as if we have a good shot [at nationals] and a lot of potential,” Hem said. “We’re all really excited about putting in the work over the next few months that will help put us in a good spot.”

Injuries in sports may be as inevitable as death and taxes, but the way these ailments are subsequently handled has the potential to define the strength of a team.
Fortunately, at Harvard, there’s an app for that—or rather, dozens of medically-trained professionals dedicated to making sure that student-athletes can recover both safely and soundly.
The strength of this underlying support system is dependent upon each individual trainer, but also upon the entire organization’s focus on research and education. After all, there’s much more to the system than just tending to injuries. The athletic training and sports medicine staff form a deep and far-reaching network that ensures the safety, health, and well-being of athletes, one that’s perhaps deeper than many realize.
According to head athletic director Brant Berkstresser, the department has a vast store of resources that athletes need to know that they can access. This makes the first priority, perhaps not surprisingly, educating players and coaches.
“The big point comes down to really trying to educate student-athletes,” said Berkstresser, a 2013 Dean’s Distinction Award Winner. “We try to educate them on the services that are available—the fact that we have certified athletic trainers within our athletic training room [who are] able to evaluate, treat, rehabilitate, and make return-to-play decisions in regards to athletic injuries and illnesses.”
Many of the trainers have degrees in kinesiology or athletic training and all have vast experience in the world of athletic training. The department has an internal medicine physician, an orthopedic surgeon, a digital x-ray with an x-ray tech in the athletic training room, a part-time sports dietitian, and a part-time chiropractor, all of which are readily available to Harvard athletes. The athletic trainers do everything from taping ankles for practice to walking a player through the concussion protocol.
Berkstresser emphasized the importance of educating players and coaches on hydration, nutrition, and heat illness during play, as well as perhaps the most hot-button topic of athletic injuries–concussions.
“We want to make sure our student athletes understand what the signs and symptoms of a concussion are, the significance of reporting them as soon as they notice them, and how that can really shorten the recovery time,” Berkstresser said.
For junior water polo defender Dan Stevens, the educational efforts of the department translated into a success story on the ground level.
Last year, he suffered a concussion two weeks ahead of the water polo team’s Northern Division championship tournament, a disheartening development for an integral player on the team. With help from athletic trainer Calleigh Fangmeyer, a graduate student at Boston University, though, he was able to both recover safely and eventually get back in the pool.
“Calleigh took me through the entire protocol, and she was very good, very safe, very accurate with her assessments,” Stevens said. “Most importantly, I’ve never had concussion-like symptoms again, so I think that’s huge and a testament to how she helped me handle my concussion.”
Berkstresser added that student motivation is another factor in the speed of the recovery process.
“It has to do with student-athletes who are highly motivated to play their sport,” Berkstresser said. “Not just for themselves, but from the standpoint of the team’s goals.”
In addition, injured athletes have a hard time swallowing the fact that they may miss games. Something that may not be written in a trainer’s job description, but is vital to their effectiveness, is their ability to connect with the athlete.
“Calleigh’s not only accurate from a medical perspective, but she treats us with compassion,” Stevens said. “A lot of the time, it’s a difficult decision for her when she has to make a call.”
Trainers’ goals are to tend to the ailments of athletes in a way that is safe, but also minimizes the time off the field. When one of Stevens’ teammates had forearm tendinitis, Fangmeyer the training staff focused on managing his reps and treating the injury on a week-by-week basis, allowing him to not miss too many games whilst still keeping the condition under control.
Such success stories, according to Berkstresser, aren’t all too rare.
“There’s a lot. You always have them,” Berkstresser said. “We had three football players this past fall who had some injuries—the average time would be about 6 weeks—and none of those guys missed a game.”
On a higher level, the sports medicine department supplements the work of every athletic trainer with cutting-edge research.
“One of the great things about medicine and athletics is that both of them are always evolving and changing fields,” Berkstresser said. “You’re constantly adapting and innovating, whether it’s technology, whether it’s from a medicine standpoint, or different manual therapy skills that are coming out. You really always have to evolve and make sure that you’re continuing to educate yourself as a health professional.”
At Harvard, Berkstresser is currently involved in aerobic and anaerobic studies on the heart, as well as a recently-launched project that aims to detail the biomarkers linked to concussions.
“Sometimes you can be challenged to do a differential diagnostic between a concussion and another ailment,” he said in regards to the pilot study. “Right now, there’s no objective data, you can’t MRI somebody, you can’t do a blood test—you have to go with what they tell you.”
The Harvard sports medicine department may be working on broadly-sweeping research, but for the athletes, it is the department’s day to day work that is most important.
