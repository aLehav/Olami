After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Chiara String Quartet may have performed in some of America’s most prestigious venues, but their attitude towards classical music is anything but elitist. As well as Carnegie Hall, the group has appeared in less traditional spaces such as pubs, clubs, and sandwich bars. The group, who are the current Blodgett Artist-in-Residence at Harvard, will continue this trend by performing in both Paine Hall and the Queen’s Head Pub this week.
“[Playing in non-traditional venues] has got some obvious disadvantages,” says Jonah B. Sirota, the group’s violist. “Acoustically it’s not as good, people aren’t paying as much attention. The advantages for us are really that we’re potentially reaching a different audience... it’s more relaxed, people don’t feel like they have to dress up or fit into any sort of socioeconomic bracket.”
While they don’t see themselves as an outreach program, cellist Gregory L. Beaver hopes to inspire a love of classical music in a wider audience.
“What appeals to me is finding the casual listener who realizes that they really love the music that we’re playing [and] the intensity of what we do as a string quartet,” says Beaver.
On Wednesday, the quarter will perform in Paine Hall, while on Thursday, the group will bring their “Chamber Music in Any Chamber” to the Queen’s Head Pub for a free concert. The quartet was unable to reveal what they would be playing at the pub—not because it’s a secret, but because they rarely decide club show set lists before the day of the performance. “We like to keep it fresh,” says Rebecca J. Fischer, the first violinist.
Fischer hinted, however, that the audience will likely hear compositions by Beethoven—as suggested by the show’s tagline, “Beethoven in Bars”—as well as brand new pieces. “We have some newly commissioned works from young composers... we just received them this past month. If we’re lucky, we’ll try to play some of that,” she says.
The Chiara (clear, pure, or light in Italian) Quartet is composed of Sirota, Beaver, Fischer, and Julie Yoon on second violin. Rising stars in the world of chamber music, the group’s performances have been described as “truly breathtaking” by the Washington Post and “superb” by the New York Times.
The history of the quartet goes back to 1993, when Beaver and Fischer, then high school students, attended the Musicorda chamber music festival at Mt. Holyoke College. But their separate college careers made it impossible for them to convene on a consistent basis. “It was kind of a pipe dream for a while,” Sirota says.
Yet when all three ended up at the Julliard School for their master’s degrees, and Yoon joined the group to complete the line-up, they won a Chamber Music America residency to live and play concerts in North Dakota. “We packed up and moved from New York City to Grand Forks, North Dakota. Culture shock is probably an understatement,” says Beaver.
According to Sirota, the quartet used the rural residency as a springboard to perform in competitions, and ended up building a reputation and concert repertoire by playing in renowned venues like New York City’s Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.
That burgeoning reputation also led to their being selected for the Blodgett Residency at Harvard for 2008-09. The Blodgett Residency is a two-year-long program which, according to the Harvard Department of Music website, “provides for distinguished artists and ensembles to spend four weeks each year in residence at Harvard University offering workshops, coaching and lessons to Harvard students.” Each residency requires the group to perform at least one free public concert.
Professor Thomas Kelly outlined the main criteria the Blodgett Committee used during the decisions process.
“Essentially what we’re looking for is a group that’s young, dynamic, exciting, excellent musicians, and with a willingness to explore a wide range of repertoires and venues. But musical excellence has to come first, and we think [the Chiara Quartet] are just terrific,” Kelly says.
Coinciding with their residency at Harvard, the quartet is also embarking upon an ambitious mission to play all 16 of Beethoven’s string quartets in concert—some portion of which the Queen’s Head audience is likely to hear Thursday.
“We’re hardly original in this project. Playing all Beethoven’s string quartets is akin to running a marathon or climbing Mount Everest. It’s one of the big goals a string quartet can aspire to,” Sirota says.
Despite their ubiquity, Beethoven’s quartets still hold a special appeal for the group. “He put his most interesting and sometimes his most intimate work into his quartets,” Sirota says. “Beethoven went through such dramatic artistic and aesthetic changes over the course of his life that you can put together programs that are interesting, and have a great variety of music, just made up of his quartets.”
Now in the second year of their residency, the quartet is setting about continuing the diverse projects they began last year. In 2008 the group spent its four weeks on campus doing everything from sight readings of student composers’ works to performing at House dinners and giving demonstrations in music theory lectures. “We’re really available for what people want to use us for,” Sirota says.
As for their upcoming performances, Beaver warns audiences to be prepared. “Intensity is the name of the game,” he says, “so seatbelts are required.”

Harvard Law School students have heard nothing but bad news on the job front this year. After weathering a tough recruitment season, law students are now faced with a round of budget cuts that will worsen employment opportunities in the public sector as well. On Monday, Harvard Law School suspended the Public Service Initiative, a program that waived third-year tuition for law students who pledged to five years of public service after graduation. While budget cuts call for belt-tightening, it’s sad to see HLS’s Public Service Initiative disappear.
Given the high cost of law school, finances can often be a determining factor in law students’ career choices. According to HLS Student Financial Services, the standard student budget for the 2009-2010 school year is $67,900. Although financial aid is available, even a portion of this amount is a daunting price that many students will pay for themselves with student loans. Under this pressure, choosing to go into the private sector, where the average starting salary for 2008 HLS grads was over $155,000, can be a more stable and financially responsible choice than taking less lucrative job in public service.
Therefore, it is important to provide financial incentives to allow interested grads to pursue important work in public service and not feel required to take a corporate job to pay the bills. The tuition waiver is not just a symbolic gesture of HLS’s support for public service; it can mean the difference between a student starting on their career path in the public or private sectors. HLS will form a committee to suggest a successor to the Public Service Initiative whose recommendation will be announced in March of next year, and we hope this body will take provide some sort of adequate replacement to provide financial incentives for public sector work.
While it is admirable that HLS has moved to increase its allocation of financial aid by $2.7 million, this does not serve the same purpose of helping those who need it most. Students from low-income backgrounds who go into corporate law after graduation will no longer be low-income students when they are paying back their loans. Monetary resources should be directed toward those who will actually have difficulty with loan repayment, and that will be students in lower-paying public sector jobs.
Though this budget cut would, all other things being equal, likely lead to reduced enthusiasm for public service, given the weakness of the corporate law labor market, demand for public service jobs is up at the moment. Consequently, the flow of students into public interest careers may remain high for the immediate future. In this job market, the post-graduation employment choice for law students is often between no job and a low-paying public sector position, in which case the latter option would still be relatively more lucrative. However, this does not excuse the elimination of an important program that enabled HLS’s students to use their skills to promote the common good, and we hope to see the school replace the Public Service Initiative soon.

Student groups no longer have to stress as much over reserving rooms for their meetings and events thanks to a new online reservation tool unveiled by the UC this week. The tool is a good first step in centralizing room reservation and making space on campus more accessible to students. Moreover, it is nice to see the UC follow through on one of its promises.
The UC’s website now includes a detailed spreadsheet listing hundreds of available rooms to reserve across campus. The site also conveniently contains information about each room’s capacity, media capabilities, and contact person. According to committee members, the UC plans to soon integrate this spreadsheet into the Computer Science 50 maps.cs50.net interface with help from instructor David J. Malan ’99. The Office of Student Life has also assisted with the overall project. We are pleased to see both faculty and the administration work and support the UC in an endeavor that is bound to benefit the student body.
The project, however, is far from complete. Currently, the website only displays room information. Ideally, the site would also serve as an actual reservation tool where students can reserve rooms electronically. UC members agree with this assessment and seem to be working toward this goal, which is a good sign. They have announced plans to hire a student programmer in order to upgrade their system in the next year.
The initiative is undoubtedly impressive. Nevertheless, the process of preparing this spreadsheet took an astonishing amount of time. The plan has been a year and a half in the making already. We urge the UC to speed up its efforts: Preferably students would not have to wait another 14 months for this tool to be fully functional—the time frame certain committee members have given.
Given Harvard’s decentralized structure, the UC’s accomplishment so far is no small feat. Each House has its own rules and regulations concerning which rooms can be reserved and by whom. For instance, Eliot’s JCR cannot be reserved under any circumstances whereas Kirkland’s JCR is now featured on the UC’s website. We appreciate the transparency and convenience that this website offers.
Finally, the announcement should also help bolster the UC’s image among undergraduates, especially after the election fiasco. Hopefully, this achievement will help the UC regain the trust of its constituents and help better establish its effectiveness as a governing body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, Barack Obama took his first presidential whirl around the Far East, all the while peddling the messages of our nation. The common refrain? “We welcome China’s effort to play a greater role on the world stage—a role in which its growing economy is joined by growing responsibility.”
This simple principle—that with great power comes great responsibility—is accepted by most prominent public figures, from Obama to other Western leaders to Spiderman’s Uncle Ben. The People’s Republic of China, though, seems to be having some trouble with it.
Lately, the People’s Republic has been in the bad habit of making ever larger investments with questionable African regimes. A week before Obama’s tour, during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao promised to lend Africa $10 billion in low-interest development loans over the next three years and to forgive many older interest-free loans made to less developed nations.
While this sounds rosy enough, even interest-free money isn’t ever really free. Rather than use its economic leverage to stamp out corruption or push for human rights, as the West does, China’s demand is instead a request that African markets open up to the dumping of Chinese products, that participating governments refuse to recognize Taiwan, and that any development contracts are forged exclusively with Chinese companies.
The People’s Republic, for its part, adamantly invokes the Westphalian defense that, unlike America or the World Bank, it doesn’t involve itself in the internal affairs of other nations. Yet such invasive preconditions suggest otherwise. The terms of Chinese loans certainly put limitations on African sovereignty, just not on African corruption.
As China steps into its role as a global leader, it must be more careful about how it presents itself on the world stage. Technocrats in Beijing can hardly hope to veil their foreign policies as well as they do their domestic ones. Political and economic success story that it is, China is a role model for scores of developing nations. Under the dual threats of setting those nations astray and losing its own international good standing, China therefore needs to change its Africa policy—and fast.
Of course, China’s initiatives are far from malicious in and of themselves. In fact, they might do the perpetually forgotten continent an unprecedented amount of good. Among the tangible benefits of the November deal are $1 billion for small business, massive improvements in African infrastructure, reduced tariffs, construction of 100 clean-energy projects, and sponsorship of programs in health, education, culture, and agriculture. Since 2000, such measures have not only built China political goodwill, they have also expanded the dollar value of Chinese trade with Africa tenfold.
What is deplorable, though, is that by providing an alternate source of investment without any progressive strings attached, China is undermining the efforts of Western reformers who offer corrupt or dictatorial regimes only humanitarian aid or loans that are conditional on political reform. By providing economic opportunity without incentives to liberalize, China is only emboldening and legitimizing tyranny.
Needless to say, the many African nations that do not suffer corrupt government deserve to be extended loans free of austere prerequisites. But China’s track record suggests that its dealmakers are hardly selective enough.
The Beijing Olympics thrust into the spotlight China’s massive investments in genocidal Sudan. The rancor that followed marked the first time China faced the international humiliation that comes with injudicious investment in troubled regimes. Since then, China has emerged from a year-long financial crisis as a global leader, not just a player. And yet the People’s Republic persists.
In late September, the Guinean military junta murdered 150 demonstrators and raped scores of women who peacefully sought civilian rule. Two weeks later, a secretive Chinese conglomerate with several ties to state-owned enterprises and governmental agencies struck a $7 billion deal for oil and mineral rights with the Guinean dictatorship, even as the United States and European Union slapped it with sanctions.
At the end of the day, China has every right to strike bilateral deals with other nations, regardless of the terms. But if it persists in failing to consider the moral responsibilities that come along with visible leadership in a globalized world, China risks losing that very leadership itself.

Pro-abortion advocates are up in arms over the Stupak amendment to the House’s health-care bill. This amendment would prevent federal dollars from subsidizing any health-insurance plan that covers abortion outside of rape, incest, or medical risk to the mother. The main argument put forward against the amendment is that it is, as this page put it, “an outrageous curtailing of lower income women’s right to choose.”  By this argument, in depriving these women of their “right to choose,” the Stupak amendment would force women to seek unsafe abortions that would risk their lives.
There are two problems with these arguments: The illogic of saying that the amendment would remove some women’s “right to choose” and the questionable assumption that imposing any restrictions on abortion would necessarily lead to more unsafe abortions.
Let us be clear: The amendment in no way makes abortion illegal.  Abortions would still be legal and widely available; however, they would require the woman to either have supplemental insurance or to pay out of pocket.  There are two things to note from the start. First, the state government could provide the supplemental insurance. Many states offer such coverage to supplement Medicaid, which also does not cover abortions.  Second, in 2001, the average abortion at 10 weeks of gestation cost $ 372, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion non-profit group.  In other words, anyone with an iPod could reasonably afford an abortion at 10 weeks.
However, let us discuss for the sake of argument the small subset of women for whom the Stupak amendment would make abortions prohibitively expensive.  The claim that this fact deprives them of their “right to choose” merits further inspection.  First, it implies that abortion is the kind of thing that women not only have a right to obtain, but also that they have a right to obtain regardless of whether they can pay for it.  To illustrate the difference, this argument likens abortion to the right to an attorney; if you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you.  Contrast this with my right to ride the subway—I certainly am entitled to ride the subway however often and for however long I want, but only provided that I can pay for it.  In either case, abortion is considered permissible, but only in the former case would the government be right in funding it. The anti-Stupak arguments do not provide any reason why abortion should become one of the former, stronger kinds of rights.
A second challenge to this claim is that it rests on an assumption: If a choice is made based on economic necessity, it is not a real, truly free choice.   However, abortion proponents must consider how often women seek abortions because they cannot afford to raise a child.  Is this not, too, making a decision based on economic necessity?  Does this not, too, deprive a woman of her right to choose not to have an abortion?  If the government were to fund abortions, it would also have to offer complete support of child-rearing in order to protect a true “right to choose.”
Finally, opponents of the Stupak amendment claim that the amendment would lead to more unsafe abortions, which are likely to harm women.  Participants in an anti-Stupak rally in Harvard Square on Nov. 18 brandished coat hangers and handed out flyers that said legal restrictions on abortion “just make abortions dangerous.”
This claim likely has its roots in a 2007 Guttmacher Institute study of worldwide abortion that concluded that countries in which abortions were illegal had significantly higher rates of unsafe abortions.  However, the fatal flaw in this conclusion is that the countries where abortions are illegal are almost entirely developing countries, including most of Africa.  The countries where abortions are legal include the United States, Europe, and other already developed nations. Moreover, 97 percent of unsafe abortions were in developing nations.  This argument attributes the disparity in unsafe abortions to legal restrictions while not addressing the fact that medical care in countries where abortion is illegal is vastly inferior, much less available, and often not performed by adequately trained professionals.  So it is misleading to claim, based on this study, that making abortions illegal would cause a rise in unsafe abortions. (Moreover, it is important to remember that the Stupak amendment does not actually make abortions illegal.)
President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as the Democratic champions of the health-care bill, have been repeating the mantra: “This is not an abortion bill; it is a health-care bill.”  The irony of this situation is that it is pro-abortion advocates—not anti-abortion advocates—who are seizing this opportunity to wage a pro-choice vs. pro-life battle.  It is unreasonable to say that the Stupak amendment would curtail any women’s “right to choose,” and, moreover, there is no evidence it would lead to unsafe abortions.

Two Mondays ago, The New York Times offered a contradictory message on America’s ballooning budget deficit.  A front-page article, “Wave of Debt Payments Facing U.S. Government,” warned that higher future interest rates will soon add heavily to the cost of funding the national debt.  Meanwhile, economist Paul Krugman, in his column published the same day, referred to the fear of massive long-term debt as an over-exaggerated “Phantom Menace.” He argued that Congress should continue deficit spending in order to boost the economy.
One might conclude from these articles that America is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  If Congress takes Krugman’s advice and passes an ambitious jobs bill, it risks pushing the deficit to even greater heights.  But if Congress eschews further recovery spending, employment and growth will remain anemic.  However, the situation is far from hopeless; it is possible to take meaningful action on both the jobs and the debt front.
America’s economic performance in 2009 seems to be a RINO: recovery in name only.  Though third-quarter GDP growth was positive at 2.8 percent, this figure is lackluster compared to GDP growth in post-recessionary periods in the 1980s and 1990s.  Worse, unemployment has reached 10.2 percent, a 25-year high, and is still climbing.  Economists expect it to peak early next year, but it is likely to remain elevated for some time; the Fed expects an unemployment level of 8 percent in 2012.
With economic figures this moribund, a wise strategy would begin by attacking joblessness.  Congress should treat high unemployment as its most immediate concern and enact robust jobs legislation, even if it increases the short-term budget deficit.  Though this might seem counterintuitive, fighting unemployment is a necessary precursor for curbing the national debt’s growth.  Returning people to the workforce will increase GDP, which replenishes the federal government’s tax revenue and shrinks the budget deficit.  As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it, “We’ll never have deficit reduction until we have job creation.”
Fortunately, Congressional Democrats, fearing the wrath of voters in the upcoming midterm elections, are seriously considering passing legislation to fight unemployment.  Potential policy measures include fiscal aid to the states (so that they can avoid firing public sector workers), business tax credits for new hires, and greater infrastructure spending.
The spike in joblessness could not have come at a less opportune time, as it coincides with the budget deficit reaching levels unseen since World War II.  Funding for the Troubled Asset Relief Fund, the stimulus package, and other recovery measures have pushed this year’s deficit to $1.4 trillion.  The total national debt stands at around $12 trillion, or 80 percent of GDP.  Furthermore, the White House projects significantly smaller yet persistent shortfalls throughout the decade.
Deficit hawks believe that this much debt places the economy in jeopardy.  Right now, much of the national debt is financed at low interest rates.  As the economy recovers and interest rates rise, investors will demand higher rates to continue lending to Uncle Sam.  The cost of servicing the debt will increase, making it that much harder to escape constant budget deficits.  Worst of all, this will happen as the baby boomers retire, placing additional pressure on Social Security and Medicare.
For these reasons, President Barack Obama should propose a well-defined deficit reduction plan at next year’s State of the Union address.  This policy should reverse the Bush income tax cuts on the wealthiest one percent of taxpayers, eliminate many tax deductions, form a commission to recommend binding changes to entitlement program funding, and sharply reduce wasteful subsidies to agribusinesses.  However, he should promise that the plan will take effect late in 2011.  By then, the economy (and, by extension, tax receipts) should be growing at a respectable pace.  Announcing this pledge today will demonstrate a commitment to long-term fiscal health, assuaging America’s creditors. Delaying its implementation will give Congress enough time to use its fiscal firepower for economic recovery.
In Homer’s Odyssey, the Greeks are forced to cross a narrow channel between Scylla, a six-headed monster, and Charybdis, a whirlpool.  Similarly, President Obama must safely navigate the treacherous waters between unemployment and the spiraling national debt.  The success of his first term, and his prospects for a second, may depend on it.

A ribbon shaped from red plastic cups with candles burning inside lit the steps of Memorial Church yesterday evening, and a larger ribbon of red Christmas lights shone from the front of Grays Hall. The candlelight vigil at Memorial Church, followed by the lighting of the ribbon on Grays and a discussion about gay men’s sexual health in the Brazilian immigrant community, was held as a part of the World AIDS Day celebrations, organized by Queer Students and Allies and Global Health and AIDS Coalition.
“The theme of World AIDS Day this year is Universal Access, so we wanted to reach out to the whole community,” said QSA Co-President Marco Chan ’11, who helped to organize events for students at the College while also involving the Cambridge immigrant community. As the celebrations were arranged with limited involvement from the administration, Chan said that it was all the more important to host a variety of events, with students taking the initiative to raise awareness among different circles.
Linda Ellison, a lecturer on women, gender, and sexuality, said she was impressed with the students’ organization of the event but disappointed with the administration’s failure to address the subject of AIDS at a University-wide level.
“AIDS is on the agenda of the UN and governments all over the world,” she said. “It’s a shame it’s not on the agenda of the most prominent university in the world.”
Ellison said that she was disappointed by the University’s lack of attention to World AIDS Day, particularly in light of the decision made by University Health Services last year to cancel anonymous HIV testing.
“The director claimed that the stigma about AIDS is over and only promiscuous people need to be tested,” Ellison said. “But they’re withholding a lot of information from students about what happens if testing isn’t anonymous.”
She said that job applicants with HIV tests on their medical record are often considered “at risk” by potential employers and face higher insurance premiums, and international students who test positive for HIV can be deported.
“There’s a lot that people don’t know, and events like these remind people that we still have a long way to go,” said Jia Hui Lee ’12, a member of QSA. “This is not something that’s solved yet.”

Sarah Palin jokes and witticisms abounded at the international debut of Steve Almond’s “This Won’t Take But a Minute, Honey” as the local author gave a reading of his new, self-published book at the Harvard Book Store to an audience of over 50 people.
The book comprises 30 300-500 word “short short” stories and 30 brief essays on the psychology and practice of writing. It was offered with three different covers to be printed using the Harvard Book Store’s 2-month-old “Paige M. Gutenborg,” an Espresso Book Machine that prints books on demand.
The machine, which can print a fully-bound book in five to ten minutes, allows authors to produce their work independently and according to Almond, has the potential to give authors total control over the content of a book. It also allows artist to artist interaction in the cover design process.
For Almond, the book launch marked a significant departure from the traditional top-down method of printing using big-name publishers. Almond described this alternative process as “conducive to allowing a book to become an artifact that commemorates the communal experience, rather than a commodity.”
Bronwen Blaney, one of the Harvard Book Store’s managers, said that the machine also allows book vendors to get books that are old or in low supply to customers quickly and at prices as low as $8, depending on publishers’ demands and whether or not it is in the public domain.
Attendees at the debut of “This Won’t Take But a Minute, Honey” had the option of having their own, hot-off-the-press copy of the book printed as they were treated to a reading of several excerpts from Almond’s self-published work. The subjects of the readings ranged from serious topics like Hitler’s demise to more humorous but instructive stories concerning unfriendly cashiers and the Red Sox.
After Almond’s well-received reading, several customers queued up to print copies of their book and get them signed by the author, whose joked that his goal for his evening was “to outsell Sarah Palin.”

CORRECTION APPENDED
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and four of the University’s professional schools offered a voluntary retirement program yesterday to eligible members of their faculties, marking the culmination of months of planning initiated by the fiscal troubles of the last academic year.
The packages, offered by the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, the Harvard Divinity School, and the Harvard Graduate School of Education, represent the first official faculty retirement program laid out by the University since the federal mandatory retirement law—which permitted Universities to force professors to retire at the age of 70—was repealed in 1994.
Under the terms of the program circulated by FAS, the University’s largest school, tenured faculty members 65 or older who have served at Harvard for at least 10 years are offered three retirement tracks varying by dates of retirement and accompanying benefits. The shortest term “1-Year Option” allows a maximum of a single year of paid sabbatical to faculty looking to enter retirement in 2011, while corresponding tracks make provisions for those indicating an intention to end their service in 2012 or 2014. Those faculty choosing to participate must accept by June 30, 2010.
The unveiling of the package—applicable to nearly one-fourth of the tenured faculty in FAS—comes less than a month after FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said in an interview that he plans to reduce the overall size of the FAS in upcoming years through attrition. Currently, 24 percent of Harvard’s tenured faculty is aged 65 or older—the average age of tenured faculty members within FAS is 56.
The proposal for a faculty retirement package surfaced as a possible cost-saving measure in the spring, when FAS learned that it faced a daunting $110 million deficit. In February, the University had opened an early retirement incentive program for staff members, 531 of whom ultimately took the package.
In previous interviews, Smith himself has framed the faculty retirement packages, which were in progress as early as this spring, as part of budget-saving effort aimed at resurrecting the Faculty from a financial deficit that yawned as wide as $220 million in April (the figure has since been cut in half, Smith announced this fall). If any of the 127 faculty members who were offered the package chose to accept it, the plan would open up positions that would only be filled again on a case-by-case basis.
The package is presented as a service to professors for whom retirement is already in sight. “The FAS faculty retirement program is designed to support faculty who are considering retirement,” wrote FAS Spokesman Jeff A. Neal in an e-mail to The Crimson Wednesday.
Neal added that there was no target figure for participation in the program or any projections relating to the amount of budgetary relief that could be in store for FAS.
“[W]e do not expect that there will be any savings related to this program in the near-term and we cannot estimate at this time what savings may accrue in the out years,” Neal wrote.
In the past, Smith has emphasized that over half of the Faculty’s budget is allocated toward compensation for staffers and professors.
Harvard professors are currently the highest paid in the country, according to a recent report by the American Association of University Professors, with an average salary of $192,600 per year. In the 2009 fiscal year, FAS spent $147.8 million on all faculty salaries, according to the Dean’s Annual Report.
The FAS package is a one-time offer, which, currently, the Faculty “has no expectation of offering...again at a later date,” according to page nine of the pamphlet sent out to eligible professors today.
Last spring, in the midst of budget troubles, the University offered an early retirement package to staff members aged 55 or older who had served at Harvard for 10 years or more. That package was expressly proposed as an early retirement incentive aimed at trimming numbers and cutting costs.
In the FAS faculty package, eligible professors are presented with three options—a one, two, or four-year retirement plan. All eligible professors will be given $1,000 to support their financial planning while considering their choices.
In the one-year plan, professors would maintain research and advising obligations while on paid sabbatical during the 2010-2011 academic year and retire fully by June 30, 2011.
In the two-year plan, professors would maintain part-time teaching positions for the next two academic years, including two semesters of paid sabbatical, and retire fully by June 30, 2012.
In the four-year plan, professors would teach and fulfill service obligations halftime and retire fully on June 30, 2014.
Under all three options, faculty members will be paid their full salaries during the 2010-2011 fiscal year, so the plan will not affect the budget plan for the upcoming year to be announced this spring.
Harvard’s creation of an early retirement option for faculty places the University in the company of many of its peer institutions, including Stanford, University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, and Dartmouth.

An earlier version of the Dec. 3 news article "FAS, Four Other University Schools Offer Retirement Plan for Faculty Members" incorrectly stated that Princeton had put in place an early retirement plan for its faculty. In fact, Princeton's early retirement package applied only to staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Jay O. Light announced his decision to retire at the end of this school year in an e-mail sent to the community yesterday afternoon.
After leading the school through a wave of budget cuts earlier this year, Light, who joined the Business School faculty 40 years ago, said that it was a good time to step down.
“I had to take ownership of the process of making sure this institution got through what we now call the ‘Great Recession,’” Light said in an interview yesterday afternoon of the past year’s fiscal challenges. “We’re at the right place to bring in a new dean who will execute whatever set of choices we make.”
During his five-year tenure, Light oversaw the completion of a $600 million capital campaign, the complete renovation of the school’s Baker Library, and the introduction of the 2+2 Program, which allows rising seniors to apply and, if accepted, work for two years after graduation before matriculating.
But Light said he thinks he will be remembered for expanding the HBS Global Initiative, a growing international network of research centers, and spearheading initiatives to build faculty and expand the school’s curriculum in areas such as health care and social enterprise.
University President Drew G. Faust said that she plans to appoint a successor by the time Light steps down in June 2010. Faust added that she will assemble a search committee in the coming weeks.
“It was very helpful for me to call a number of leaders in the field across the nation,” Faust said of the recent search for a Law School dean to replace former Dean Elena Kagan. “I think with the Business School it should be across the world.”
Prior to permanently assuming the deanship in April 2006, Light had been a member of the school’s leadership team for 23 years, serving as a senior associate dean and chair of the school’s finance unit.
M. Scott Daubin, co-president of the HBS Student Association, said that Light always solicited student input in making administrative decisions.
“One of best qualities that Dean Light has is that he really understands the student perspective,” Daubin said. “He was always very conscious of student opinion.”
He added that students especially enjoyed the dinners Light would often host as prizes for student-run charity auctions at the school.
Daubin said he hopes that the next dean will also have extensive experience teaching and working with business school students.
“Being inside the case method classroom is hard to replace, and I really hope the next dean has that,” he said. “We’re sorry to see him go.”

Samuel J. Bjork ’10, a chemistry concentrator in Eliot House, left his interview for a Marshall Scholarship in Chicago last month with misgivings.
“I ate a soggy burrito, flew [back to Harvard], and just tried to forget about it all,” Bjork said.
The following day in class, the native of Cambridge, Minn. received a phone call notifying him of his Marshall Scholarship to pursue graduate studies at any university in the United Kingdom in the two years following graduation.
“I think I giggled for a while,” said Bjork, who is an inactive Crimson editorial editor.
One of only 35 Marshall Scholars—the lowest number in the past five years—Bjork plans to spend his first year working toward an M.Phil in the history and philosophy of science at Cambridge University. His plans for the second year have not been finalized, but Bjork is considering an M.Sc. in organic chemistry at a different university.
“I think I’m just chronically indecisive,” said Bjork, who flirted with concentrating in the humanities before settling on chemistry. “I’m not sure if it’s a good thing or a bad thing at this point, but I’m grateful for the opportunity to be indecisive in England.”
Stanford topped this year’s list of Marshall Scholars with four recipients. Yale and MIT followed with two scholars each.
Up to 40 American undergraduates are granted the prestigious scholarship every year. All applicants must have a GPA of at least 3.7.
During his time at Harvard, Bjork, who is teaching organic chemistry at the Extension School this semester, has conducted research exploring the anti-cancer effects of certain antibiotics and producing ethanol in bacteria as a possible source of renewable energy with Harvard Medical School genetics professors Jack Szostak and George M. Church as well as ry professor Andrew G. Myers.
Andrew Tolonen, Bjork’s research advisor in Church’s lab, spoke highly of Bjork’s work, adding that he was able to clone a gene in his first week on the job.
“Sam would be a great asset to scientists because he thinks about why scientists do what they do,” Tolonen said.
Outside of the lab, Bjork also played violin in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra for three years and contributed to several campus publications. He also took a year off after his sophomore year to work at a pediatric HIV/AIDS clinic in Gaborone, Bostwana with a Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Public Service Fellowship.
University Professor Peter L. Galison cited his former student’s intellectual capabilities for science and the humanities.
“He brings just the right combination of aptitude and innovation for the field,” Galison said.

CORRECTION APPENDED
The Harvard University Employee Credit Union was closed briefly midday yesterday after a man demanded cash in a letter he handed to a teller at 11:15 a.m.
According to Kevin Galvin, a Harvard spokesman, the man then fled with an envelope containing an undisclosed amount of cash. He appeared to be unarmed, and no injuries were reported.
Liz C. Bloom ’12, the assistant financial manager for the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, entered the bank just after the man left. She was the only customer in the lobby when she entered the bank, and she was depositing a large sum of money at the counter when she noticed the teller who was counting her money drastically slowing down. Bloom said she saw that her teller was distracted by another teller’s facial expression.
Both tellers, Bloom said, then ducked under the counter and started whispering, leaving Bloom with the piles of cash on the counter.
“I didn’t see anything,” she said. “It wasn’t a holdup. It was quietly done.”
Bloom said she did not know a robbery took place until she finally asked her teller if everything was okay.
Moments later HUPD entered and closed the doors to the bank, not allowing the few customers who had just trickled in to leave, and not admitting new customers. While the police took down names, the bank continued to complete transactions.
Bloom said the atmosphere in the bank during the entire incident was rather quiet—aside from the flustered teller, no other parties seemed emotionally disturbed or concerned.
The bank reopened before 2 p.m.

The Dec. 3 news article "Credit Union Robbed Quietly" incorrectly stated that the person who allegedly robbed the Harvard University Employees Credit was arrested after his bus was pulled over by the police. In fact, though a suspect was taken from a bus nearby, according to a witness who requested to remain anonymous, the person who allegedly robbed the bank is still at large, according to Harvard Police Sergeant Wilmon Chipman.

Several dozen Harvard employees and students rallied outside the Holyoke Center last night, protesting the budget cuts that may dim the holiday season for some University staff.
Members of the local branch of the Service Employees International Union, which represents security guards and janitors, joined other unions representing technical and clerical workers and dining hall staff, waving picket signs and chanting as University administrators streamed out of the Holyoke Center at the end of the workday.
Union officers addressed passers-by on a portable P.A. system, trying to encourage them to participate in the rally as they walked past.
“Most people have no idea how they are going to pay their bills, no idea how they are going to feed their family!” said Edward B. Childs, a cook in Adams House and the Co-Chief Steward of Unite Here Local 26.
Emeka Onyeagoro, a library employee running for Widener union representative of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that University staff were most concerned by the prospect of additional furloughs, which require them to take an unpaid period of leave while still paying out of pocket toward their benefit packages.
Other workers protested the replacement of full-time staff with part-time student workers. Desiree A. Goodwin, a library assistant at the Graduate School of Design, said that this meant students would be deprived of a dedicated library staff, and laid-off workers would lose their primary source of income.
According to Onyeagoro, fewer than half of the 119 workers in HUCTW who were laid off earlier this year have found employment elsewhere at Harvard, even though they had been promised priority consideration for other positions.
Harvard announced in June that it would lay off a total of 275 employees from across the University, in an effort to cut labor expenses after a precipitous decline in the value of the endowment.
Members of the Student Labor Action Movement carried a sign that read “The Harvard Corporation Stole Christmas,” and one pedestrian who noticed the student criticized the University for what he considered “unconscionable” actions.
“Harvard should be setting an example, according to principle,” said Mike McGann, an Ohio resident visiting Cambridge who observed the rally for a few minutes.
Several students passing by expressed sympathy for the University employees, but they questioned the effectiveness of the protests.
“The spirit is more impressive than the substance,” said Patrick W. Spence ’12. “These things tend to be a little peevish and ineffective.”

Laughter is supposedly contagious, but so is loneliness, according to a new article co-authored by Harvard Medical School professor and Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis.
In the article “Alone in the Crowd: The Structure and Spread of Loneliness in a Large Social Network,” Christakis and his co-authors argue that loneliness can be transmitted from person to person within a social network, and that even individuals who are included in social networks can feel lonely. According to Christakis, the article on loneliness takes a more technical approach to the loneliness theory discussed in his newest book.
“Most people think of emotions as only properties of individuals,” Christakis said. “Collective anger and fear of riots are typically considered group emotions, but we wanted to look at everyday emotions like loneliness.”
Christakis has received much attention for his research on social networks and was included in Time magazine’s list of the world’s most influential people in 2009.
In September, he and University of California at San Diego professor James H. Fowler ‘92 released a book titled “Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives.”
The article was a collaborative effort with Fowler as well as University of Chicago professor John T. Cacioppo that was published Monday in the December issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Christakis, Fowler, and Cacioppo used a decade’s worth of data collected by the Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1971 and asked its subjects about their emotional state at regular intervals.
After reprocessing the data, the trio constructed the social networks using ties, such as familial or professional relationships, recorded in the original study.
The average American experiences loneliness 46 days each year, but this number is reduced by five percent for every friend he or she has, Christakis said.
The study found that loneliness is prevalent on the “edge” of the network and is transmitted between connected individuals, who eventually sever their connections with each other.
This result may demonstrate the need to address the spread of the loneliness contagion, which he said could negatively affect social cohesion.
“We need to pay attention to those at the edge­­­­­—franchise the disenfranchised,” he said, “The loss of ties because of loneliness could impact the vast fabric of humanity and cause an unravelling process like pulling the loose string of a sweater sleeve.”

Frederick “Fritz” A. Henderson—a 1984 graduate of the Harvard Business School—resigned as CEO of General Motors on Tuesday after the Board of Directors asked him to step down, a move that stunned the auto industry.
G.M. Chairman Edward E. Whitacre announced he would serve as the interim chief executive in a press conference Tuesday, making him G.M.’s third chief executive in nine months.
Although Henderson appeared to be making some progress to outsiders, he did not implement changes quickly enough to satisfy the Board’s desire for change.
“While momentum has been building over the past several months, all involved agree that changes need to be made,” Whitacre said at the press conference, according to the New York Times. He added that G.M. was “on the right path,” but needed to move more quickly under new leadership.
Henderson’s resignation comes eight months after the Obama administration forced the resignation of former CEO G. Richard Wagoner—a 1977 graduate of the Business School.
The government, which owns 60 percent of G.M., did not play a role in Henderson’s resignation, said a G.M. spokesperson cited in the New York Times article.
Henderson, who has worked at G.M. for 25 years, may be too closely tied with the company to provide bold changes, according to Business School professor Joseph L. Bower ’59.
Although G.M. has not provided details on its search for a new chief executive, Bower said that the company would most likely look for an outsider who “would do things that were just too difficult for Henderson [as an insider].”
He added that it is important for G.M. to move quickly.
“G.M. doesn’t have forever to fix itself,” he said. “The papers tell us that the board concluded that Henderson was a good man, but he was not willing to move fast enough transforming G.M. into a 21st century company.”
Yet Bower and some of his colleagues at the Business School said that a change in leadership during this pivotal time for G.M. could hinder the company’s transformation.
“The one thing you don’t want to have when you go through this sort of situation is a crisis of leadership,” Business School professor James B. Harreld said. “You do not want to see two dips, two crises of leadership in such a short period of time.”
Business School professor Malcolm S. Salter ’62 said he did not know if the change would benefit G.M., but questioned the quick timeline that the Board seemed to want the CEO to follow.
“At some point there is a speed limit,” he said.
In an earlier e-mailed statement, Salter wrote that the breech between Fritz and the board was “a shame.”
“Another good man takes the fall for failing to immediately turn around a problem that was decades in the making before he came on the scene,” he wrote.
Salter, who taught Henderson at the Business School and also knew Wagoner from his time at Harvard, said that both were “men of strong values in a very tough industry.”
He described Henderson as a “serious student...an energetic class participant and a really smart guy.”
“He worked well in groups and was a total pleasure,” Salter added. “He invested and he performed, what could be better?”

Massachusetts is soaking up the sun.
A $68 million state fund that provides rebates to homeowners and businesses who install solar panels had been entirely disbursed in October after a mere 22 months, though the funds were expected to last up to four years.
Denise Jillson, executive director of Harvard Square Business Association, said she was not surprised by the ambitious investment in energy efficiency.
“The fact it took only about half the time for the funds to be used up is indicative of how this issue really is important to all people,” Jillson said, adding that several Square businesses have contributed to sustainability through a solar Wi-Fi mesh network and solar panels.
Since the program—financed through surcharges on utilities and electricity usage—was met with such overwhelming demand, Massachusetts officials are preparing a new plan that is expected to be available on Jan. 1. This successor project, dubbed Commonwealth Solar, is the preliminary phase of the clean energy initiative—championed by Gov. Deval Patrick ’78—geared toward achieving 250 megawatts of solar-generating capacity in Massachusetts by 2017.
Jenny Harvey, the program coordinator for sustainability at Harvard Real Estate Services, said she attributes the state’s pursuit of a robust renewable energy policy both to the affordability of renewable options and the desire of institutions to increase their sustainability in the public eye.
Harvard has recently undertaken several measures to reduce its carbon footprint. A 500-kilowatt photovoltaic solar array—approximately 2 1/2 football fields long—is in development for the rooftop of The Arsenal, the largest building at the Harvard-owned Watertown office complex. Harvey added that this project would not have gone forward without the $1.1 million grant from the state’s Commonwealth Solar rebate program.
“There is a great effort to promote more solar in Massachusetts,” said Mary H. Smith, an energy strategist for Harvard’s University Operations Services. “The incentive programs are changing.”
Harvard’s other recent efforts to improve sustainability include its agreement made on Nov. 2 to purchase 10 percent of its annual electricity usage in the form of wind power, making the University the largest institutional buyer of that type of energy.
University President Drew G. Faust had previously announced a campus-wide initiative in the summer of 2008 to curb greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2006 levels by 2016.

Several Harvard undergraduates held signs outside the Holyoke Center yesterday afternoon, trying to coax fellow students and Cambridge residents to call their congressmen and encourage them to vote against the Stupak Amendment.
The amendment, tacked onto the House Health Care Bill, would deny abortion health care coverage to women receiving care under the public option or any federally-subsidized private plans.
Convincing more than 20 passersby to call congressmen, the half-dozen volunteers represented the Students Against Stupak, a subsidiary of campus organization Students for Choice. They handed out free condoms and coupons to J.P. Licks as incentives to boost what rally organizers said was a national effort to flood representatives with calls to kill the amendment to the House Health Care bill.
“If the Health Care bill were to pass with this amendment, the result would be a women’s health care crisis,” said Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, who led the call-in initiative.
“Anti-choice people tend to call their political representatives very frequently, and I think that pro-choice people sometimes get complacent,” Reis-Dennis added.
Michele S. Zemplenyi ’13, a Washington state native and one of the students who called in, said she was motivated to phone her representative by her belief “that there’s no reason that a woman in the free world should be denied abortion coverage.”
Reis-Dennis said that the national goal was for each college campus to promise 50 calls to congress.
Local residents joined in the effort to call congressmen, sometimes borrowing students’ cell phones.
“Any issue that energizes students to interact constructively with the people who live in Cambridge and therefore step out of the ‘Harvard bubble’ must be pretty special,” Elizabeth J. Newton ’11 said.
If the Stupak Amendment were to pass Congress, the existing House Health Care Bill would only cover abortions in the instances of rape, incest, or potential harm to the life of the mother.
The New York Times reported yesterday that Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch is also planning to introduce an equally stringent amendment to the Senate bill.
“Our efforts won’t end after this [call-in],” Reis-Dennis said. “This is only one element of a much larger and continued effort to make sure that the Stupak and any other similarly-worded amendment doesn’t pass. Women deserve coverage for abortion.”

Visiting Harvard Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed hosted a panel discussion yesterday evening about U.S. President Thomas Jefferson and his relationship with slave Sally Hemings.
The discussion, which took place in Austin Hall at the Law School, was based on Gordon-Reed’s latest book, The Hemingses of Monticello, in which she explored how Jefferson and Hemings’s relationship impacted their children.
The book, which was completed after 10 years of research, won several national awards including the 2008 National Book Award in Nonfiction upon its release.
Despite the amount of research she did on the subject, Gordon-Reed said that writing about the Jefferson-Hemings dynamic was no easy task.
“It’s difficult because you’re writing about a slave owner and an enslaved woman. There is the difficulty of pulling together the lives of people who don’t have lots of letters,” she said.
Harvard history professor James T. Kloppenberg said that Gordon-Reed’s book challenged older assumptions about Jefferson and the nature of master-slave relationships.
During the panel discussion that followed, Gordon-Reed explained the significance of acknowledging different accounts of Jefferson from the slave children that he fathered with Hemings, rather than relying on the accounts of white men who had no respect for the slaves.
“The historical witnesses who were enslaved were not given credence [but] the words of the people who owned them were accepted,” Gordon-Reed said.
Several people who attended the event said they were impressed by Gordon-Reed’s enthusiasm for the subject.
“Dr. [Gordon-]Reed has allowed our female ancestors to speak again through her research,” said Virginia C. Cash-Kemp, a Massachusetts resident who attended the discussion.
Brandon C. Slaughter, a teacher at Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Mass. and a descendant of Jefferson and Hemings, said he found the discussion interesting.
“I was very impressed [by Gordon-Reed’s discussion],” he said. “I’m a history teacher, so, above all else, I just think it is a unique story.”

Massachusetts Congressman Edward J. Markey announced his endorsement Tuesday of fellow Congressman Michael E. Capuano in his bid for the vacant Senate seat of the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56.
Capuano, who decided to run in early September, represents the 8th Congressional District of Massachusetts, which includes Cambridge, Boston, Somerville, and Chelsea.
“Mike [Capuano] combines the street smarts of Somerville with the decisiveness of his Dartmouth education,” Markey said at a press conference Tuesday.
“Having worked with him in Congress for the last 11 years, I know that he will be a passionate and effective force for progressive values in the United States Senate,” Markey said.
Markey had also been expected to run for the seat, but shortly after Capuano declared his candidacy, Markey announced that he would not pursue the position.
“I am thrilled to have Ed’s endorsement of my candidacy,” Capuano said at the press conference. “His commitment to my campaign demonstrates a recognition of what I’ve accomplished in the U.S. House and of what I can achieve as a senator.”
Markey is the longest serving congressman from Massachusetts and one of the most senior Democrats in the House. Markey said that his seniority in the House would make him more useful there as an advocate for Massachusetts than he could be as a freshman senator.
So far, Capuano has been endorsed by seven of the nine other congressmen from Massachusetts. Representative Niki Tsongas endorsed Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley, and Representative William D. Delahunt has not yet issued an endorsement.
Capuano has also received endorsements from former Mass. Governor Michael S. Dukakis and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, the late Senator’s son elected from Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District, praised Capuano but stopped short of endorsing him for the Senate seat.
Capuano’s competition for the Democratic nomination currently consists of Coakley, Institute of Politics Fellow Alan A. Khazei ’83, and Boston Celtics owner Stephen G. Pagliuca.
Voter turnout for the election is expected to be low because of the unusual timing—the primary will be held next Monday, Dec. 8, and the final election will be on Jan. 19.

It was payback time as soon as the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team stepped onto the courts in Hanover, N.H. last night. After having lost to No. 8 Dartmouth (3-1) in a scrimmage last month, the Crimson (3-0) brought a more united front in the Big Green’s first Ivy League competition, winning, 6-3, for its third victory of the season.
“I think that, on the whole, the team came together,” co-captain Frank Cohen said. “It was a mark on our calendar for a while.”
Co-captain Colin West, ranked second in the country, improved his record to 3-0 with a 3-0 win in the No. 1 spot, defeating Christopher Hansen, 11-9, 11-3, 11-4.
West was among six Harvard players with undefeated records going into yesterday’s match.
One of those, junior J. Reed Endresen faced off against Dartmouth’s Michael Shrubb winning all three games, 11-6, 11-9, and 11-3, eventually securing the No. 4 position with a 3-0 victory in the match.
“I knew my opponent was injured,” Endresen said, “so I just went in there looking to crush him. It was good to get that win.”
Freshmen Jason Michas and Alex Ma finished with 3-0 wins as well.
Michas, playing in the No. 5 slot, defeated Dartmouth’s Luke Lee after emerging victorious in the first game of the match.
While the first game featured a back-and-forth duel, with Michas eventually coming out on top by a score of 17-15, the next two games were less of a challenge. The freshman won the second game by a score of 11-8 and the third by a score of 11-3.
The Big Green’s Daniel Wagman proved to be less of a challenge for Ma, who took the No. 9 position with game scores of 11-5, 11-9, 11-7.
Crimson coach Satinder Bajwa complimented the progress that the freshmen on the team have made.
“They both played a very mature game,” he observed.
Will Ahmed, a sophomore, returned from an injury with a 3-2 victory in the No. 8 spot, claiming wins in the match’s first, second and fifth games.
“Will Ahmed has almost fully recovered and he showed it by winning a match today,” Bajwa said.
Harvard junior Richard Hill and his opponent Nicholas Sisodia went back and forth in an energetic battle. The first game went to Hill, 11-6, while Sisodia took control in the second and third games, with the score ending at 11-7 in both.
Hill quickly rallied, with the fourth game ending 11-8, and sealed the deal with an 11-6 victory in the fifth game.
Dartmouth took the No. 3, 6, and 7 spots defeating freshman Zeke Scherl, Cohen, and senior Alex Lavoie. Scherl and Cohen lost their matches 3-1 while Lavoie lost 3-0.
“This was a good win for us,” Endresen added. “It was good to beat them and really make a statement there. We’ve got young guys stepping up, which is nice.”
The Crimson’s match on Saturday against Cornell will prove to be a similar challenge, with the Big Red ranked right below Harvard at No. 6, but Bajwa believes that his team will be prepared.
“The next match is a touch-and-go match like this one was. We can only prepare 100 percent and see how it goes,” he said.
“Everyone just has to go out there and play really well,” Endresen said. “Cornell has a deep team. A lot of young guys. All of their spots are strong.”
Cohen echoed a similar sentiment.
“I think we’re in a good position,” he said. “It will definitely be a tough match. Individually everyone has their own things to work on.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seemed like it was going to be easy for the Crimson women’s basketball team.
Junior Emma Markley directed the opening tip-off to sophomore point guard Brogan Berry, leading to a basket by freshman Victoria Lippert before 10 seconds had expired, and Harvard amassed nearly 20 points before Holy Cross got on the board.
Lippert and Markley were hitting their shots and would finish the half with 10 points apiece. It looked like the Crimson (4-3) would sail smoothly to an eventual 74-57 defeat of the Crusaders (3-5).
“I loved how we started, and I’m proud of how we started,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It’s not unusual to get a big lead like that and then think that the game is over.”
But a change of winds was in store.
As the first half wore on, the Crimson appeared more and more comfortable with their seemingly-unchallenged lead, and Holy Cross started to fight its way back into the game.
The Crimson rode into halftime with a 16-point advantage, but the game was much more even.
The teams switched roles in the second half. This time, it was the Crusaders who got on the board first, with guard Brianna McFadden hitting two free throws to open the second period.
“I guess my halftime speech was awful,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’ll work on fixing [it].”
Holy Cross charged into the second half with an energy that was absent from its play in the opening minutes of the game. Harvard seemed unable to respond to the Crusaders’ increased intensity on defense, and its shots simply stopped falling.
“Too many of us are catching as passers and not catching as shooters,” Delaney-Smith said. “We’re catching the ball, and then getting low and looking to shoot. I want us to be catch-and-shoot people.”
On the other end of the court, the Crimson found itself in foul trouble, and Holy Cross capitalized on its trips to the line.
Crusaders forward Whitney Fremeau hit two free throws with 14:27 to go, narrowing the margin to three.
“I think the game is really about momentum,” Markley said. “The more energy you can bring to the court, the more energy from the bench, the more energy from the fans, whatever you can do to rile your team up is eventually what’s going to rule the game.”
With the score 40-37, the Crusaders took control of the game’s energy as well as its momentum.
“What we had to do was calm ourselves down, think about the fundamentals and focus on defense,” Markley said.
Fittingly, Harvard’s turnaround started on defense with a rebound from junior co-captain Claire Wheeler. On the following play, Berry slashed to the basket, where she was fouled.
The sophomore hit both of her shots.
“Brogan’s our rock,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s the boss on the floor.”
Lippert was next on the board with a three-point shot at 12:53, followed by a Wheeler layup, putting Harvard back up by 10.
Never again would Holy Cross challenge the Crimson for the lead.
Harvard dominated the end of the game just as convincingly as it did from the tip-off.
Markley led the way with 18 points, 15 rebounds, two steals and two blocks.
“They had to double her to take her left shoulder away and they still couldn’t stop her,” Delaney-Smith said.
Berry was second in scoring with 16 points, and junior co-captain Christine Matera went 4-for-8 from beyond he three-point line. Lippert finished with 13, as four Harvard players scored in double digits.
“Everyone has to contribute,” Markley said. “It can’t be one or two players. Everyone’s got to bring it.”
The Crimson closed out the game with a 17-point margin of victory. Towards the end, the Crusaders lost the composure that had brought them within three, and Harvard finished the game as smoothly as it began it.
“We need to come out with a lot of intensity,” Markley said. “We did. We came out with a lot of energy in the first half. In the second half, it started to go back and forth, but we were able to pick ourselves up and finish strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team (3-0) stayed undefeated in convincing fashion last night, routing ninth-ranked Dartmouth, 9-0.
The Crimson handed the Big Green (1-1) its first loss of the season and won a crucial in-conference match. In doing so, Harvard dropped only one game, going 27-1 in nine matches. This stellar performance resembled the Crimson’s past two victories, 27-1 against Brown and 27-0 against Williams.
The scores of each individual game were not available when The Crimson went to press.
Harvard has not won the Howe Cup, the A-division women’s squash championship, since 2001 and has lost in the finals to Princeton for the past two years. Returning all of last year’s starters and with notable freshman additions—such as Laura Gemmell, playing in the No. 1 spot—the Crimson appears set to make a real run at reclaiming the Howe Cup.
Last night’s win against Dartmouth came in overtly hostile territory, with Harvard playing in the packed and pressurized conditions of Berry Sports Center.
“The atmosphere was pretty crazy,” said co-captain Katherine O’Donnell, who reckoned that around 200 rowdy fans were in attendance at the match. “We were being very patient and very focused...we did a good job of bearing down—especially the freshmen.”
No. 6 O’Donnell won her match, 3-0.
“I definitely used a slower pace; I wasn’t trying to overpower the ball because the courts here were really hot,” she said. “I tried more to place the ball.”
In general, O’Donnell said, the team has been having consistently strong chemistry.
“Our team dynamic is awesome and I think everyone is working really hard to keep it up,” she added.
Coach Satinder Bajwa seemed to concur with O’ Donnell’s assessment of Harvard’s mindset.
“They’re all treating their matches as if they could lose, they’re respecting every opponent, and there’s no complacency,” he said.
Some of last night’s success can be attributed to a changed workout routine.
“We have reworked our strength and conditioning program,” explained co-captain Johanna Snyder. “We do a lot more agility work...the staff has developed a program that’s great for squash.”
The victory came without the aid of sophomore Emily Park, last year’s No. 4 player. Park has been struggling with a strained back this season.
“She’s always at practice and is a huge part of the team,” O’Donnell said. “Hopefully she’ll be back any minute."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard showcased flair and fundamentals last night when Rice (4-3) came to Lavietes Pavilion. The Crimson (6-1) built up a 14-point lead in the first half and cruised to an 85-64 win in a game abounding with highlights.
Perhaps the most sensational play came less than four minutes into the action with both teams struggling.
Together, the two squads had already combined for eight turnovers when sophomore guard Oliver McNally sent an alley-oop to freshman forward Kyle Casey.
The freshman skied and flushed, eliciting cheers from the crowd and igniting a Harvard offense that was hot for much of the night.
“The coaches want me to bring a lot of energy, so we ran our play and we executed pretty well,” Casey said. “It kind of sparked us and got us going.”
But with five minutes remaining in the first half, the Crimson was still unable to pull away and led only 25-19. A three-pointer from the right wing by freshman forward Christian Webster extended the lead to nine.
On the subsequent possession, co-captain Doug Miller kicked the ball from the post back out to Webster in the left corner where the freshman buried another three. Harvard’s lead never dipped beneath nine afterward.
The Crimson’s prolific offense was matched by its defense, which forced 12 turnovers in the first half en route to holding the Owls to just 26 points.
“[I was] very pleased with, I thought, a stellar defensive effort by our team,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[I’ve] been very impressed with the way our kids have been able to bring great energy and effort to the defensive end.”
Leading 40-26 at the half, the Crimson wasted no time extending its lead in the second frame. The offense looked to sophomore forward Keith Wright to shoulder the scoring load, and the big man responded by scoring six straight points.
On the night, Wright led Harvard with a season-high 16 points on 8-of-10 shooting.
“They were throwing it into me so I had to finish,” Wright said. “That’s the main thing I’ve been working on all year.”
“[He was] efficient around the goal, making his layups and his post moves,” Amaker said. “When we can go inside and play inside-out, we like the way our offense flows.”
The offense was both solid, sporting a 60.8 field goal percentage on the night, and spectacular. Three minutes into second half, Webster got the ball as he cut into the lane and delivered a no-look pass to Miller, who finished the play with a dunk.
Midway through the frame, co-captain guard Jeremy Lin dribbled up court on a fast break, and took the ball directly at Rice forward Trey Stanton as if to dunk the ball.
Fouled at the height of his jump, Lin went sprawling but managed to bank his shot off the backboard and through the hoop as he collapsed on top of Stanton.
The play and the following free throw accounted for three of the senior’s 14 points on the game.
Minutes later, sophomore point guard Oliver McNally contributed his own circus play. Driving in the lane, McNally pulled up in front of Owls guard Emerson Herndon and launched a floater as he was clobbered to the floor. The basket fell and McNally converted the ensuing free throw.
“Our style of play is very important to us,” Amaker said regarding the Crimson’s highlights. “Not just the dunks, but the brand, the movement, the freedom, the structure...That’s hopefully something that can draw other people to want to watch our kids perform and compete.”
The 85-64 win, in which all of Harvard’s healthy players saw time on the court, brought the team to 6-1 on the season. The start is the Crimson’s best since 1984-85 when it began 8-0.
“It’s a nice thing for our kids to hang their hats on,” Amaker said. “They’ve earned it. We’ve played a tremendous schedule so far, and it only gets incredibly tougher from this point forward.”

Papers got you feeling down on your luck? The Harvard Square Qdoba's got a new promotion that could help you turn the tide.
For at least the next few Wednesday evenings (3-7 p.m.), any customer at Qdoba can take advantage of Dice Day Wednesdays—a 50-50 chance to win a free burrito and soft drink by rolling a large green die at the register. If the customer lands an odd number, the combo's on the house. If not, the customer pays full price.
Christian Chauvet '12, one of this week's gamblers, struck out with his first roll but amazingly had the appetite to try again—and win. "It was a cool thing to do and I was hungry," he said.
But not everyone handles victory with Chauvet's calm.
"I've had guys tonight react like they've win a million dollars," said Qdoba Assistant Manager Jenna Delorenzi. "They go crazy."
The promotion is only at the Harvard Square location but is only sure to run through January, according to Delorenzi, so get on this soon if you won't be on campus for J-Term.

If there is such a thing as a classy way to rob a bank, we may be able to learn a little something from the man who ran out of the Harvard University Credit Union with an envelope full of cash Tuesday morning. The man allegedly marched into the bank only minutes before, seemingly unarmed, and presented the teller with a letter demanding cash.
Yep, that's right. A letter.
Was his getaway just as classy? Find out after the jump.
With an undisclosed amount of cash safely in his hand, the man allegedly hopped on a bus, hoping to get far from the Square. He didn't get very far. Cambridge police pulled the bus over in short order and arrested him.
Liz C. Bloom '12, who was at the bank just after the robber left, said that the teller who was counting her deposit suddenly stopped and ducked underneath the counter with another teller. (The duck and cover technique only keeps us safe from tornadoes, not bank robbers, silly.) Bloom was left puzzled and at the counter with her large sum of money splayed out in piles, the two tellers exchanged in whispers about what they should do next. Bloom did not know a robbery had occurred until she asked over the counter if everything was alright.
HUPD eventually came to the rescue by briefly closing the bank. Though no one could leave or enter the bank, tellers continued to make transactions for those customers still in the bank as well as new customers waiting outside. How? We're a bit puzzled by that too.
The University confirms that no one was hurt during the incident (not even by a paper cut from the letter). The bank reopened before 2 p.m.
Lesson learned: Write a letter the next time you need money. It works. Sort of.

So what does being a State Dinner crasher get you? Subpoenaed, apparently. In light of today's congressional hearing looking into the antics of the now infamous Salahis, Flyby talked to Harvard's very own History Professor Emma Rothschild and her husband Professor of Economics and Philosophy Amartya Sen who were two of the lucky few to get an invite to the first State Dinner of the Obama administration.
Follow the jump to find out what they had to say about the pair.
"The Salahis have inadvertently contributed to more understanding of the gaps in the existing [security] system, and that is the positive take on this dangerous - but happily past - affair," wrote Sen in an email to Flyby.
I'll say.
But the Secret Service may have a friend in Rothschild who came to their defense. "[The security] seemed careful," said Rothschil.
So, how exactly did two people manage to get into the White House of all places uninvited? Well thats what Congress is trying to find out as we speak.
But in other news, Professors Rothschild and Sen brushed elbows with the now infamous couple at the State Dinner. "I remember thinking that Mrs. Salahi looked very pretty in her sari," Sen wrote, "but a little unsure about what to do with so much drapery."
