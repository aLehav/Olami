[Editor's note: DC Comics' "The New 52" initiative aims to bring a new audience into the DC Universe by rebooting or significantly changing all of their superheroes and restarting them back at issue #1. In this series, the comic book newbies of The Crimson attempt to evaluate the quality and accessibility of The New 52.   —Brian Feldman, Arts Web Editor]
The new Justice League #1 is a little hard to follow initially, as it places more focus on the visual than dialogue and contains no narration. It's like watching still frames from a film, so for a newbie like myself, it takes some concentration. Almost the entire issue is dialogue that provides little exposition, and so it is as if the characters are as in the dark as the audience is. The banter is typical 21st century. That is to say sarcastic and casual. The Green Lantern, upon meeting Batman for the first time, exclaims in disbelief and disappointment: "You're not just some guy in a bat costume, are you? Are you freaking kidding me?!" Gone are the days of sound effects like  "Bam!" and "Pow!" which used to show strength and a certain level of badass-ness. Now the sound effects are "KRRRRKKKK" and "Krash" with a "K". Because ‘crash’ with a ‘c’ is less cool than ‘Krash’ with a ‘k’.
The great thing about this new series is that the superheroes know as little about each other as new readers will. They're like the Gen Ed classes of comic books. They assume no prior knowledge of the subject, and are tailored to the new reader with no (or little) DC experience. This issue introduces Batman, the Green Lantern, and Superman. The heroes are all learning about each other and aren't yet sure if they are allies or rivals. At one point, Superman punches Green Lantern right in the face and then asks “So… what can you do?”
For readers who are still unsure whether comic books in general are fun or intimidating, DC has included a page dedicated to the "New 52" that makes this issue and all the others in the reboot accessible. It lists all the new #1's and makes it easy to see how everything fits together. For someone who doesn't know the difference between the Legion of Super-Heroes and Justice League International, you can at least see that two such things exist, you can see their release dates, and you know that if you read those comics, you will gain greater understanding of what is going on throughout the DC universe.
Powering through the initial confusion of a new #1 is worth it for a chance to see some behind-the-scenes sketches by Jim Lee that give insight into the costume choices and the thought process that went along in creating this new version of the Justice League.
The new art from Jim Lee is great—a cross between the classic Ben-Day dot comic book printing style and a grittier realism. Batman’s costume maintains his persona of utilitarianism and modesty while ink Scott Williams makes Green Lantern’s constructs glow with a flashiness almost rivaling his ego. The superheroes all, in a way, resemble Transformers and Power Rangers—action figures but with better costumes. Rugged, strong, not too sexy.
Geoff Johns’ storyline itself is not that thrilling because very little happens. Batman meets Green Lantern, they trade insults, and then travel to Metropolis to find the mysterious Superman. In the final two pages, while Batman and Green Lantern are still getting their bearings, Superman makes a powerful and authoritative entrance. With Superman standing over Batman, eyes glowing and ready to fight, the issue concludes with the ominous words “Next: Batman Vs. Superman.” Quite the way to get a new reader to pick up Justice League #2.
Although short on story and information, Justice League #1 contains tons of action, and the added bonus of a sense of accomplishment for a new reader following it all the way through. Perhaps because of its limited scope, it’s approachable, and in that sense DC has accomplished its goal.

Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 sat patiently in his yellow Adams T-shirt and blue swim trunks, swinging his legs as he waited for someone to hit the red button.
When a baseball finally hit its mark, Palfrey slid smoothly into the water below, his arms forming a “V” for victory.
“It’s about time,” Palfrey said, grinning as he rose from the water.
Palfrey joined House Committee chairs from each House as voluntary victims of the dunk tank at “Cape Crimson”—this year's welcome back event hosted by the College Events Board.
Students filled Tercentenary Theatre Friday evening, drawn by the promise of a dunk tank and a Slip ‘n Slide, and forced from their Houses by their dining halls’ shut doors.
Red, blue, and yellow umbrellas dotted the lawn as students tossed “Welcome Back” Frisbees and bounced around inflatable beach balls.
CEB secretary Ece Erdagoz ’14 said that the group settled on the Cape Crimson concept because it wanted a them that fit with the end of summer season.
“We wanted to encourage people to get wet and wear swimsuits,” Erdagoz said.
Though students were told to wear “beach attire,” many stripped down to sports bras or boxers to slide down the 33-foot Slip ‘n Slide. More than one person went down fully-clothed.
And with only Dunster and Currier open for the dinner, many hungry students flocked to Tercentenary Theatre for seafood rolls, corn dogs, and a salad of mesclun greens.
As some students ate their meals on the steps of Widener Library, others signed waivers to ride a surfboard simulator.
Canyon Woodward ’15 was ousted from the Harvard Resource Efficiency Program’s “Eco Limbo” after face-planting, shirtless, in the mud, but stood up from the ground with a smile.
For him, the limbo game was his favorite part of Cape Crimson—“a great welcome to Harvard,” he said.

With “Justice” out of the running this year and Life Sciences 1a coming in third, Economics 10: “Principles of Economics” took the lead as the most-enrolled course this semester.
The mega-course taught by campus legend N. Gregory Mankiw will introduce 731 students to classical economic theory, a marginal drop from the 776 students it had last year.
“I am delighted that so many students are choosing to take Ec 10,” Mankiw wrote in an emailed statement, adding that he wished he could enroll every single freshman—with the exception of students who are already prepared for more advanced coursework—in the course.
But what’s rising to be a formidable foe to the market leader is Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”—not that Ec 10 disapproves of competition.
An increasingly trendy course with a project fair and even its own logo, CS 50 drew 651 students this semester, a 32 percent increase in enrollment since last fall when 494 students took the course.
“We’re thrilled, both as a course and as a department and school,” lecturer David J. Malan ’99 wrote in an emailed statement.
The jump continues the multi-year rise in enrollment for the course. Since the fall of 2007 when Malan took the helm of the class, course enrollment has increased by 131 percent.
“At Harvard, the person who gets the credit is David Malan,” Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83 told the Crimson last May. “He turned CS50 into a class with a real community.”
Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology,” a requirement for most subsequent life science courses, had the third highest enrollment with 517 students.
The six newly-designed General Education courses also had a strong showing on study card day, with Ethical Reasoning 30: “The Just World” leading the pack with 121 enrollees.
Ethical Reasoning 30 was so popular that two additional discussion sections were added after enrollment figures came in, according to the course website, boosting the number of sections in the course to seven.
Culture and Belief 50: “The European Postwar: Literature, Film, Politics” and United States in the World 36: “Innovation and Entrepreneurship: American Experience in Comparative Perspective” also did well, with Culture and Belief 50 drawing 109 students and United States in the World 36 drawing 96 enrollees.
Enrollment in an existing Gen Ed course, Culture and Belief 22: “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization,” skyrocketed, jumping from 68 enrollees last fall to 224 this semester.
On the first day of shopping period, Professor of Classical Greek Literature Gregory Nagy said he thought that the high turnout to his course was due to “a genuine hunger for understanding classical civilization at a time when moral problems seem to overwhelm us.”
Nagy said he was encouraged by the interest in his course “at a time when science is very eminent as a speciality.”
“The numbers that we’re now getting are reflective of the kind of interest Harvard students still have in the humanities,” Nagy said. “Scientists too have hunger for the humanities.”
On the other hand, Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science” saw a dip in enrollment, drawing only 175 students this fall after enrolling 273 students last fall, the first semester the course was offered.
Last year, Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice” took the lead with 800 students, but the popular philosophy course is not offered this year.
Initial enrollment figures could change over the course of the semester as students add and drop classes.

I was walking through City Hall Park the other day, just to stretch my legs. There’s a visual art exhibit, it looks just like pieces of plastic  on grass.  A tourist came up to me, you could tell it was a tourist, with her daughter attached to her legs. She said, “Excuse me mister, can you tell me where the Twin Towers are?” I said, I’m sorry? She said, “The Twin Towers.” I said they aren’t here any more. She rolled her eyes at me and said, “Well I know that, I mean where were they.” I was looking at the visual art exhibit. You mean Ground Zero, I said. She said “Yeah of course, which way is it?” I said, Ground Zero is what you meant. She waited. Then I pointed. The daughter switched to the other leg while  they turned. I sat on a park bench for a while, and then I got up, and then I left.

By September 11, 2001, I was too old to allow my parents to hug me in public. I was too mature to let my mother push me on the swing or to play baseball with my dad. I was in fifth grade—we were the “seniors” of elementary school.
At ten, I thought I was old enough to understand things. So when on a Tuesday morning, students in my New York City classroom started disappearing throughout the day, my peers and I juggled around theories. Maybe they were kidnapped, we thought, or being held hostage in the basement. Finally, the teachers herded us into the auditorium and informed us that there had been a fire downtown.
When we returned to homeroom, I watched the teacher gaze out the window, her eyes lingering along the horizon, and I wondered what she was expecting to see. Satisfied with the explanation provided in the auditorium, my classmates and I chose to play computer games. I think we decided on Zoombinis. My teacher snapped at us—we were being too loud. “This is a day you will tell your grandkids about,” she said.
They closed school early that day, around one o’clock. It was then that I realized that something was wrong.  Parents stampeded toward the entrance as children approached the door. I saw my father, which was surprising since he normally did not return from work until 11 p.m.
I let him embrace me, which was even more surprising.
As we walked the mile-and-a-half home—I never questioned why we didn’t take the subway as we normally did—my dad explained to my sister and me that two planes had hit the Twin Towers, but it was too soon to know more information. My dad, who worked a few blocks away from the towers, had attended a meeting uptown that morning instead of going to the office. I did understand that I was lucky.
By the evening, my parents decided that there would be no more answering phones and certainly no watching the news. We were going to the playground.
Mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, it seemed as if the whole neighborhood had gathered in the shady grove on 91st Street and Riverside Drive. My mother offered to push me on the swing, though she had long before taught me to pump my legs and propel myself.
I let her push me. Later, I even agreed to a friendly game of catch with my dad.
I remember going high on the swing, also eying the ball each time my dad patiently threw me a pop-up. I already knew I had no baseball talent, but my dad kept throwing to me. Everyone always notes how the sky was a striking blue that morning. I remember the sky at dusk, the dust and smoke blurring my vision as I looked upward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Abdelnasser Rashid ’11-’12 was seated in class at an Islamic K-12 school in Chicago when the Twin Towers crumbled to the ground in 2001.Upon receiving the news, the school’s principal convened the middle and high school students in the cafeteria to explain that two planes had crashed into the iconic New York City towers and the Pentagon in Washington D.C.“I remember he said, ‘There are people who say Muslims might have done this. You need to be very careful out there,’” Rashid said. “I was 12 years old and I felt like I was being held responsible for what others had done.”
Following the attacks, a mosque across the street from his school was vandalized. A throng of protesters encircled the place of worship and defaced its exterior.
Ten years later, discrimination toward Muslims in America persists. For Muslims who have come of age in the years following 9/11, the events of that day set off a lifetime of discrimination and stigmatization, an experience that has been marked by selective screening procedures in airports and outright harassment.
“9/11 and its after-effects have been the most defining of my generation,” Rashid said. “Muslims have endured severe abuses of civil rights, which continue to be effectively compromised, even today.”
PULLED ASIDE AT THE AIRPORT
Efitan Akam ’12, vice president of the Harvard Islamic Society, was traveling back to the United States from Sudan in 2005 with her family members when they were pulled aside for a random search. As her parents do not share the same last name, they travelled as two different parties, but that did nothing to prevent every member of the family for being selected for a so-called special screening.
Their carry-on luggage was picked through, and Akam’s headscarf was patted down while her family was interrogated about their business in Sudan. Despite being told the procedure would be brief, Akam ended up missing her flight.
“This was the first time I felt like we were being directly targeted,” Akam said. “I don’t have a problem with extra security measures, but this was pulled out under the guise of a random screening which inconvenienced my entire family.”
Although Muslims have faced various forms of discrimination, among the most familiar and most reported by Muslims is racial profiling at airports.
Like Akam, Rashid has also faced discrimination at airports, and says that his name—common in the Arab culture and Muslim world—has led to “many supposedly random security checks.”
In the immediate period following September 11, 2001, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee reported over 80 instances of discriminatory or illegal removal of individuals of perceived Arab descent or Muslim faith from airplanes. These instances do not include discrimination at security checkpoints but gives an indication of the widespread suspicions that Muslims faced following the attacks of 9/11.
Nura Sediqe, a graduate student at the Harvard Kennedy School, is a frequent traveler who says that she commonly encounters prejudice not only at security checkpoints, but in other parts of airports as well.
When paying a visit to a meditation room, an interfaith place of worship built in many airport terminals, before an international flight, a security guard began chasing after her shortly after she entered the room, demanding that she explain what she was doing.
She said she had come to pray. The security guard shrugged and left her alone.
Once on board airplanes, the experience is not much different from the scrutiny Muslims often face from airport officials. There, however, it is sideward glances and off-handed comments from passengers that remind Muslims that the legacy of 9/11 has coupled their faith and airborne terrorism in the minds of many Americans.
While seated in the emergency exit row of a plane, Sediqe said the man immediately behind her laughed and mockingly said, “I hope this goes well, and we all get there safely.”
“People are nervous about you being Muslim and some may make small snide remarks,” Sediqe said. “This was not as big an issue before 9/11. Muslims are now self-conscious about traveling.”
The suspicions that fuel these prejudices have become deep-seated, and Muslims who have grown up in the shadow of 9/11 have had to contend with its legacy in nearly every aspect of their lives.
When she was younger, one of Sediqe’s teachers posed a question before her entire class that illustrates the contemporary Muslim experience.
“‘Why didn’t your people condemn 9/11?’
I thought this was an interesting question to bring up in class for debate, to say the least,” Sediqe said. “Subtle discriminatory instances like this can occur in various educational spaces. At the time I was pretty confident in who I was, but for another student, this could have had a profound negative impact.
WEARING THE HIJAB
Ten days before airplanes pummeled into the World Trade Center, Akam began to wear a headscarf, or hijab. For ten days she wore the religious covering, but after the attacks her mother forbade her to wear the hijab.
After a number of headscarf-clad women in her community were harassed—including a close family friend who was stalked until she removed her headscarf—Akam’s mother told her daughter that out of concern for her safety she should not wear the hijab.
Akam says her mother, who wore a headscarf before 9/11, refused to remove her own hijab after the attacks.
Fearing for her mother’s safety, Akam and her sisters were appointed her guardians.
“People yelled things at her as she was walking, like ‘rag head’ or ‘terrorist,’” Akam said.
Despite observing her mother’s struggles after 2001 and her sister’s initial disapproval, Akam began wearing the hijab the summer after her freshman year at Harvard. She arrived at her hometown airport wearing the hijab.
“My sisters thought I would hurt my job opportunities, saying it would be hard to do research in lab with headscarf on, but they were later accepting of my decision,” Akam said.
While she has found people in Cambridge generally accepting of her practice to wear the hijab, she has also confronted intolerance.
“It can be dangerous to wear the headscarf in today’s world,” Akam said. “In the Harvard intellectual community there’s lots of understanding, but in my hometown of Yuma, Ariz., people are not as accepting. I get many stares and whispers, although they seem to be more curious than malicious.”
The visible nature of the hijab also means that those who choose to wear it become public emissaries for an often embattled religion.
“It’s a bit daunting at first to be a symbol of religion, but we are all symbols of something. When we travel abroad we are symbols of what we are. The headscarf helped me to become a better person and show me what I needed to live up to and hold for all Muslims,” Akam said.
“You may be the only Muslim someone meets,” Sediqe said. “You can sometimes feel the additional responsibility of being a model person because people might generalize your actions. Islam is often perceived as a monolithic entity. Muslims are all X, Y and Z and behave in this manner. But with 2.2 billion, naturally diversity exists and it’s important to make others aware of that diversity.”
Rashid explains that he cannot discern whether the experience of 9/11 instilled in him a strong sense of being Muslim, Arab and Palestinian, or if it was his maturation during his teenage years where he began to question and explore.
While Muslim women, especially those who wear the headscarf, confront intolerance, Akam acknowledges that Muslim men face a different set of obstacles.
“Women are the poor, oppressed bad guys that need to be saved, but men are just the bad guys,” Akam said.
EMBRACING MUSLIM IDENTITY 
Shortly after 9/11, Akam says that she felt bitter toward America.
Observing the struggles of her family firsthand led her to partially shed her American identity, which she says was a natural reaction.
But as the years have passed, she says that she has reconciled her American identity with her Muslim one, although she says her sense of being Muslim and her pride in Islam have strengthened.
For Muslim youth growing up in contemporary America this feeling of alienation is fueled not only by outright discrimination but also a lack of Muslim role models in the media.
For negative images of Muslims in the media—especially the ubiquitous image of the bearded, Muslim terrorist—to become de-politicized, Sediqe says a social and cultural shift must occur to provide a positive, constructive image of modern Muslims.
“We need strong Muslim role models to be recognized for their contributions,” Sediqe said. “We have Muslim athletic legends like Muhammad Ali, hip-hop artists like Lupe Fiasco, Congressmen like Keith Ellison who are Muslim and examples that speak to the youth. Nothing will be done overnight, but progress is possible.”
Akam says strides toward progress are underway, pointing to efforts to educate Americans about Muslims since 9/11 and the rise of outwardly Muslim women entering career fields in the public eye.
“The way to combat discrimination is with education and tolerance. People need to learn what Islam is about,” Akam said. “Some think Islam teaches you to be violent and extremist but this is not true. People have been trying to educate masses about normal everyday Muslims.”
Sediqe echoed Akam’s sentiments, suggesting that only through education and interaction can tolerance be achieved.
“I am commonly asked, ‘Where are you from?’ expecting a foreign country,” Sediqe said. “But I say Ohio, surprise! People need to know the story of ordinary American Muslim girls and guys in small towns.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was in Cambridge, Mass., in the mouth of a large red slide when I first heard about the attacks, only what I heard was that World War III had begun, and that the war was why we were enjoying an early recess. I became dimly conflicted. I knew little more than that I was happy to be at recess, curved flat against the sturdy backlit plastic, but I was also vaguely aware that I should be concerned about the draft, and even sugar rations—a WWII carryover that had somehow stuck with me.
It wasn’t long before a group of us had begun a game of kickball, only to lose a few players every inning to anxious parents. I recall enjoying the game, despite the diminishing outfield, looking at the clarion blue sky and feeling ashamed at my own remorselessness. At that moment, though I couldn’t have articulated it then, I felt like everything must be different, and that I was lagging behind. The unchanging campus, and the unremarkable kickball game both felt oddly unresponsive—as if the trees should have shed their leaves, or the kickball been less lively.
No one in my family was directly affected by the attack. I believed that I had little claim to negative emotion, and was almost envious, in moments when any comprehension of the attacks’ magnitude succumbed to a general idea of their importance, of those with a personal connection to the incident. That night, my brother and I crowded around our computer. He showed me a picture with Osama bin Laden’s face clearly etched in the smoke from a burning tower, and I understood terrorism then as a sort of supernatural evil. My family was living in Mather House at the time, and when we went to dinner in the dining hall, each of the long rectangular tables had a television hastily affixed to its end.  After the meal, the house held a candlelight vigil in the courtyard. I felt both happy and guilty upon seeing the community coming together, and my comfort in observing change so clearly demonstrated. I even wondered how often we’d be gathering like that.
From then on we made gestures at an altered life. My brother was forbidden from going to work the next weekend, despite the fact that Newton, Mass.—where he sold kayaks—was surely low on the list of potential targets. My parents kept me from watching the news, but the next day at school I heard a kid on the playground bragging to a friend that he had seen the plane hit the tower almost a hundred times on television, and I was jealous. For my part, I spent a decent amount of time surreptitiously googling until I became inundated in conspiracy theories and gave up.
It wasn’t until high school that I felt any different. A year or two in, on one of the more inconspicuous anniversaries, we filed out of our classes and stood in silence around the flagpole as the bells rang out. After some time, we broke for recess, and a friend of mine came running up to interrogate me about a coming test. The whole operation felt like a fire drill. Later, I went to the chapel to try and give the day its due. Though motivated again by shame, I felt truly sad for the first time. And then I thought about that kickball game, and how little it had seemed to matter whether it was World War III or airplanes flying into buildings. I thought about growing up with longer lines for security; freedom fries and the War on Terror. But I thought most about how scared I was first by being small, knowing something was horribly changed, and feeling no different.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve always loved bring-your-kid-to-the-office day: the expansive green carpets that rolled across the lobby with flags of different nations falling from the high ceiling, the two bullet-speed elevators that my father and I would board to climb to his 56th floor office. My father worked at 2 World Trade Center for nearly ten years. At the time of the attacks, he was working in a different office. But I was in fifth grade. In school, the emergency lights in our hallways flickered alight for the only time when I was a student. We didn’t know where to be, what to do. Deemed too young to listen to radio updates, we crouched in our middle school center as teachers told us to stay calm, everything was going to be ok. Young though we were, we could sense their uncertainty.
The day after, fighter jets patrolled the air, visible from Central Park, even though the skies were grayed from airborne debris. People on the streets wore facemasks. New York felt silent.
When I came back from school that September 12th, my father told me—not out of paranoia or fear, but out of rational precaution—that I should begin carrying a photocopy of my passport in my wallet from here on out, as an official ID. I still keep the ten-year-old folded paper in my pocket. I watched as other Indian-Americans became more flustered when talking about national security. One family friend cited an example, cinematic in scope, where the FBI allegedly approached a Muslim in the States to wear a wiretap when he went to Friday mosque services. We weren’t Muslim, but the adults always talked about being careful. Family friends stopped wearing kurta pyjamas, traditional garb, to take out the trash.
As an eleven-year-old, I didn’t think much of these new habits, these new stories, introduced into my life as a child. For me, my identity—and how it was perceived—seemed unchanged from the events. And, for the most part, that was true.
Except for a series of uncomfortable random security checks. During the winter of the tenth grade, just months after the five-year anniversary of the attacks, I commuted daily to a faraway indoor track for my running practices. At the subway station I would board to get back home, there were always several cops, coolly examining the crowd that filed through the turnstiles. And frequently, I was given the opportunity to familiarize myself with them.
The first time that I was asked to step aside to go through a security check, I was with a large group of my friends, predominantly white with some African-Americans and Asian-Americans. More than a score of people had trickled past the turnstiles to enter the station, and a few of them curiously looked back as my friends patiently waited, embarrassed, not looking at the cops or me as they listened to their iPods. They were silent. The cops checked for metal objects using a detector, patted me down, and opened my bags. I was granted permission to proceed. This ceremony happened six more times, with none of my other friends stopped.
We still joke about it: “Dude, well, good thing you didn’t pull your Indian accent,” or “Hey, which cop do you think gave the best pat down?” And so on.
I was silent about the process. On one hand, in some ways I was happy that they checked me—I was glad that they were ensuring the security of subway passengers, who were sometimes rattled by fears of an attack against the underground transportation system. But I also felt distanced from the country in which I was born, educated, and called home. I lived through 9/11. I knew the World Trade Center, called it a place of familiarity. But I still began to question whether society was separating me into another bucket: as an “other,” a not-so-American.
The answer, I believe, is yes. But even if I was separated, I was still American. Getting differentiated based on my skin color is no different than many other societal judgements, as much as we pretend that we live in a society without labels. I’m still proud of this nation, and I wouldn’t want to have grown up any place else. This country is still my home.
There was one more memory that I had of the World Trade Center, and that’s of my father’s office.  As he would open his double doors, a grand wall of floor-to-ceiling windows would greet us. Past them was the Statue of Liberty. When I think of the World Trade Center, I think of this memory perhaps the most. It was a spectacular view. In school I was always the only one in the room who could explain Diwali. The Statue meant something to me, more than a tourist’s photograph. It was a sight I always looked forward to. As the Freedom Tower begins to scrape the skies, I look forward to holding that same view.

On May 1, nearly 80 members of the U.S. Navy’s SEAL Team 6 stole into Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan, aimed their guns, and rendered the man who designed the 9/11 attacks obsolete.
As Obama relayed the news to the nation in an impromptu television announcement, his face was neutral: If anything, tired. A few times, the president jumbled his words. He did not smile, he did not express relief. He reiterated that that the fight against terror continues.
America responded differently—with jubilation. Streets crowded with people in spontaneous patriotic rallies. Drinks were poured. Republicans said nice things about Obama.
At Harvard, students congregated, as they did when Obama was elected over two years prior, in the Yard.
William T. Whitham ’14, a freshman at the time, misconstrued the shouts he heard through his window: “I actually thought it was Primal Scream even though it was still a week early,” he said.
“We probably had maybe two or three hundred people there. People were singing patriotic songs, singing Harvard songs, waving flags, there was a constitution reading, etc.,” said Rajiv Tarigopula ’14, whose post on Facebook first suggested that Harvard students gather in the Yard.
But, Tarigopula said after a pause: “The next day of course a lot of people voiced disapproval.”
Now that the initial glee has been expended and months have passed, students look back at the initial response quizzically and with slight discomfort: why was the response to murder, joy? The answers given—catharsis, relief, an assertion of strength after a long stretch of apparent impotency— reveal something else: Undergirding it all, was fear.
THE FIGURE OF 9/11
No name is associated with Pearl Harbor, the only foreign attack on American soil other than 9/11. 9/11, however, was given a face. “I think bin Laden represented, especially for our generation, the enemy,” said Tarigopula. “He was the figure of 9/11.”
Bin Laden has claimed responsibility for planning and orchestrating the attack on 9/11—redirecting the plane flights and any other steps that made him the ready executioner of thousands.
But for a decade, the United States’ armed forces were unable to locate him, and his continued evasion was seen as a national failure. This was the man behind it all, and we could not find him.
In his speech on May 1, the night bin Laden was killed, Obama invoked the images of 9/11 “hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless September sky; the Twin Towers collapsing to the ground; black smoke billowing up from the Pentagon.” These images, Obama said, had been “seared into our national memory.” Bin Laden’s face, too, had come to be one of those images.
His capture, then, to some, was vindication, imbued with symbolism. Foucault tells us that the effect of power (that is, the perception that power exists) is more important than the reality of that power. If this is the case, then regardless of whether or not the U.S. remains as the world’s strongest military power, the perception that it is powerless in the face of random and senseless attacks by terrorist organizations is debilitating and in many ways undermines our military’s might.
Thus, most of those who celebrated bin Laden’s death celebrated the symbolic assassination of the leader of Al Quaeda, not the actual loss of a human life. In their view, bin Laden’s death was a largely symbolic event, representative of national triumph.
CELEBERATING DEATH?
Harvard’s celebratory response to the news of bin Laden’s death resembled the nation’s: boisterous crowds, waving flags, bursts of loud song.
The crowd in Harvard Yard was triggered by a Facebook posting: “I was looking at the Twitter feed and it was leaked that bin Laden had been killed and that the president would be making the announcement,” recalled Tarigopula, who is a member of The Crimson’s Editorial Board and a frequent contributor to the Harvard Political Review. “I immediately changed my Facebook status to ‘Meet in front of the John Harvard Statue to celebrate!’”
Students did so in hordes. The magnitude of the gathering surprised Tarigopula. But he also thinks that there was a reason for celebration. “I remember where I was when 9/11 happened and a lot of my classmates and peers do as well. For the last 10 years we’ve been living under this cloud of terror from the attacks, and [bin Laden] in a way became the face of terror, at least in the beginning,” he said. Therefore, Tarigopula maintains that bin Laden’s death “was a unifying moment,” and that the celebration was simply “a big outpouring of patriotism.”
Not everyone interprets the gathering in the same light.
Many feel that the resounding jubilation was unjustified and even perverse—a sort of delight derived from another’s death. A prevailing phrase used by critics of the rallies is “celebrating the death of a human being.”
Anna J. Murphy ’12 said that she finds the celebrations “troubling” and that she has heard others refer to the jubilation as “simply in bad taste.”
Whitham also says he feels uncomfortable with the initial celebratory response. “This man was a total monster, one of the worst criminals in recent history. It’s not that I regret his death, but I don’t know that it was appropriate celebrate in that way.”
Whutham continues, “Obviously I think the world is better off without him, but if you just look at it in that simple sense then you’re missing the picture. Basically, for the last 10 years we’ve waged this global war on terror … That’s not something to celebrate.”
'DISTRACT PEOPLE FROM PROBLEMS'
But according to C.M. Trey Grayson ’94, the Director of the Institute of Politics, the generation of people now in college is especially thirsting for something to celebrate.
Much has been written about the generation’s experience in a post-9/11 world, often referring to the new realities of airport security, Homeland Security codes, and fear of domestic attacks. But the last decade has been unsettling in many more ways than just in terms of national security. Horror stories tell of college graduates who can’t find jobs because the economy is progressively worse, of people who are turned away from medical care because they can’t afford insurance, and of an education system that is failing the country.
A Gallup poll released earlier this year reveals that only 44 percent of Americans are hopeful that this generation will have a higher quality of life than their parents, the lowest recorded number for that question in almost 30 years.
To top it off, a new social infrastructure is evolving every single day with the advances being made in technology and social media. When Walter Lippmann said in 1912 that “Modern man is not yet settled in his world,” he could not possibly have known that 100 years later we would still be struggling to figure it out.
Whitham believes it’s difficult to separate the celebrations, this blunt assertion of America’s strength, from the trend lines of the last decade. “These last 10 years have been this really frightening time. This ‘Lost Decade’ has been really alienating,” he said. “The economy, the war, problems with health care. People are really hurting. Historically, it’s been easy to have a war or an event to distract people from problems.”
Pausing a bit, he added, “A lot of our frustrating is directed towards phantoms, and we see it everywhere. Towards phony liberal politicians. Towards immigrants. Look at the Tea Party. I see those complaints, but I also think that this passion is being misapplied.”
Americans, it would seem, are eager for good news, and the 9/11 attacks can be seen as the beginning of a sense of hopelessness. The celebrations following bin Laden’s assassination, then, cannot be considered in isolation. Tarigopula said, “Those who have grown up in the shadow of the 9/11 attacks, I think, want to see justice being served.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My classmate was the first one to tell me. She said, “Two planes crashed into the World Trade Center.” My brain emptied. After what felt like hours, I conjured up the realization that I lived across the street from the Twin Towers, a 30 minute train ride from my Upper West Side school.
The girl was the grade’s know-it-all, the one who our religion teacher would later describe as “18 going on 50.” She always seemed to have information, both good and bad. In a hushed tone, our middle school’s principal said, “Two planes have hit the World Trade Center.”
The message echoed loudly in the chapel in which our teachers had mysteriously gathered us. Already numb from my classmate’s whisper, my mind remained blank.
The principal listed logistics for the rest of the day which, from what I only remember hazily, included plans to cancel classes for the afternoon, to have recreation time instead and to allow parents to pick their kids up early, the ones who could make it. As a lower Manhattan child whose mother, according to the timing of the plane crashes, would have just returned from her half-hour train trek to drop us off at school, and whose father would have been headed to work late because he was handing out fliers for the primary election that day, the question of whether my parents “could make it” loomed largely for me that afternoon.
The other issue was discussing all of this with my brother Gordon, who was only eight years old. When asked by his teacher why I had stopped by his classroom, I said, “I don’t know if my parents are alive or dead.” With a blank look on his face, he said that my brother was not in his classroom and was instead at a special elective class: computer skills. After making my way hurriedly down the three flights of steps to the basement where my brother was learning about patterns and paint tools, his teacher saw me enter the room and cut me off.  “We haven’t told the lower school students yet,” he said. I was old enough to keep a secret. I walked over to my brother and said, calmly, “Gordon, if Mommy and Daddy come here, tell them to come get me, too.” He had no clue as to what had happened. The only thing left to do was wait for my parents.
Upon the instruction of one of my teachers, I headed to the gym: to hang around and feign interest in normal things like basketball or jump rope. I spent the majority of those few hours sitting on the bleachers.
After waiting for hours for any word from them, both my parents suddenly appeared in this recreational space, a space that seemed completely normal and safe until this day. With tears rolling down her cheeks (something that I have seen happen only three times in my life), my mother collected me in her arms and told me how the two of them had to walk up the West Side Highway from Battery Park City until they found a bus that shuttled them from Midtown to my 91st street school.
My mother had been in the bottom of the first tower to be hit. I can’t remember if I said goodbye in the morning, if I had been mad at her for God knows what. She can’t remember why, but she was in the now-defunct Tower Records buying a Bruce Springsteen cassette. She literally ran into my father, who said that he was frozen in time upon seeing the planes enter each of the buildings while standing the equivalent of three blocks away from what would become Ground Zero. He was stationed outside our apartment building, handing out political fliers. The fact that they bumped into each other in the chaos and violence of that morning is beyond serendipitous.
When all four of us finally collected ourselves to the best of our ability that afternoon, we went out into the streets of the Upper West Side, which I simultaneously viewed as familiar (since I had been attending school in the area for six years) and distinctly alien (since my home was half an hour away). There was nothing for my mind to settle on. After leaving the school, out in the streets, I asked, “Where will we live now?” and my father told me frankly, “I don’t know.” I had never noticed hotels until this afternoon but these places would soon become my home-away-from-home.
I would come to find out that the windows in our apartment building were completely blown in.  My bed was covered in the dust of the World Trade Center: I felt homeless. After all, I had passed through the Twin Towers each day on my way to catching the subway. There was a shopping center my brother and I had visited each weekend as a routine. The idea of routine was thrown out of perspective. All I remember from that first afternoon itself, sitting on the hotel bed, was asking my mother, “Is this going to be on the news again tomorrow?” She looked at me blankly. She told me it would, and she was right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In wartime, Harvard students have rarely watched from the sidelines—until now.
In the first half of the 20th century, Harvard students responded to the threat of war with patriotic enthusiasm, with more than 11,000 Harvard affiliates serving in World War I. In World War II, 27,000 students, faculty, and staff served. Harvard also counts more Medal of Honor recipients among its alumni than any other school besides the service academies.
But today, students at Harvard tend to generally exhibit apathy toward the military. This generation is often described as the 9/11 generation, a term that implies that today’s young people have been marked for life by the events of that day. But if such a mark exists at Harvard, it does not appear to apply to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, both of which have their origins in the attacks of 9/11.
Since the start of the wars, 4,474 American troops have died in Iraq,  and 1,760 in Afghanistan. But discussion of the two wars is nearly non-existent on America’s ivy clad campuses. Protest and organized opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is relatively small, and only about 150 Harvard students have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, according to data collected by the Harvard Gazette in 2010. Just three ROTC-commissioned cadets graduated from the College this past May. Nineteen undergraduates were enrolled in the program last year.
Although the drop in military enlistment among Harvard students is largely due to the smaller scale and absence of a draft in the War on Terror, it is well-documented that well-educated men and women are underrepresented in the modern military. According to Pentagon figures from 2006, 17 percent of active duty member of the military have at least bachelor’s degrees compared to 28 percent of the general population. Nineteen percent of new recruits that year were high school dropouts. The median income of recruits matches the country-wide median salary, but America’s wealthiest are also underrepresented in uniform. In short, fighting wars is no longer an occupation for America’s elite.
Lacking both the support of the two World Wars and the protests against the Vietnam War, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan remain conflicts that Harvard students and an entire generation of young people have never fully rejected or embraced as their own.
“It will be difficult to make a legitimate claim that those who came of age during the current wars can be called ‘the Afghanistan and Iraq Generation,’” said History and Literature Lecturer Steven Biel.
A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR
On a bus ride to school several days after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2011, Christopher W. Higgins ’11 says he can distinctly remember the smell of smoke from the toppled World Trade Center towers. The memory, he says, was a wake-up call and made him think hard about what he wanted to do in life.
Higgins was 13 years old and living on Long Island at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks. Last summer, he was commissioned as an Army officer.
Higgins said his decision to join the military was influenced by the beginning of the war in Afghanistan. He hadn’t thought seriously about joining the military before 9/11.
“I remember watching CNN with my parents seeing images of American soldiers getting off planes in Afghanistan,” said Higgins, who will enter active duty in the Army in 2013 after he finishes two years of graduate school. “In that time of crisis, the image of everyone looking at these men and women stuck with me as maybe something I’d like to do.”
But Higgins is part of a small crop of elite college graduates heading into the Army.
Biel said he attributes much of the disconnect between young people and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the volunteer nature of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“[A volunteer army] very much changes the domestic dynamics of not just opposition to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, but the day-to-day awareness of them,” said Biel, who co-teaches History and Literature 90ak: “The Vietnam War in American Culture.” It’s much easier not to know somebody who is serving or has served in Iraq or Afghanistan than it was not to know somebody that was serving in Vietnam.”
Sayce W. Falk, an Iraq war veteran who graduated from the Kennedy School last year, said he thinks the volunteer nature of the military has created an insular conflict.
“We have a situation where the same guys are going back [to war] six or seven times in ten years,” Falk said. “Only the guys who want to fight are fighting, and everyone else is less aware of what’s going on.”
Unlike the early years of the war, in which the entire nation paid close attention to the invasion of Iraq, Falk said he thinks that “now everyone just has a fatigue with that kind of news.”
Even Falk—now two years removed from his last deployment to Iraq—said he “can’t even tell what’s going on there now.”
According to Biel, the wars’ lack of immediacy “contrasts starkly” with the Vietnam War.
“The Vietnam War was on the news every night,” Biel said. “Now, think about how many days will go by when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan aren’t the top stories, or aren’t even stories at all.”
WHO IS SERVING
The wars’ lack of immediacy for many students may be due in part to who is serving in the war.
In general, the military looks a lot like America—most recruits are middle class, though they draw somewhat disproportionately from southern, rural, or suburban regions. The military is predominantly white, and blacks are slightly overrepresented while Asians are underrepresented.
Although recruits are slightly better educated than the average American citizen, the best educated and wealthiest members of America’s youth population—who often gravitate to schools like Harvard—are underrepresented in the military.
Several times in the past decade, this underrepresentation of America’s elite was brought to the national stage when New York Congressman Charles Rangel, a Democrat, proposed legislation that would reinstitute the draft. Rangel argued that because few Congressman had children in the Armed Forces, they were overly willing to commit the United States to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. By bringing back the draft, Rangel said he hoped to inspire elected officials to think more carefully about the consequences of going to war.
“There’s no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq… if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm’s way,” Rangel told CBS News at the time.
In 2004—the only time Rangel’s bill was brought to the floor of the House of Representatives—the legislation was defeated by a vote of 402-2.
Many studies suggest that the underrepresentation of military recruits from the nation’s top universities may be due in part to the long-term absence of ROTC on Ivy League campuses.
For years, many of the best people at Harvard have “just gone on to do other things,” said Michael Segal ’76, a member of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC.
But when Harvard formally recognized ROTC last March after a forty year stand-off, an opening emerged for ROTC to increase the representation of elite students in the military.
“We would like to persuade more people from the highest socioeconomic group to serve in the military,” Segal said. “The people who meet Harvard’s filter for intellectual abilities and the military’s filter for leadership qualities tend to be really terrific people.”
But, as of now, the individuals who meet both tests are few and far between.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve started every school year I can remember with a new pair of shoes. My annual excursion to Aldo shoes was nothing less than a ritual, and never more so than on September 1, 2001, a little more than a week before my first day at Wagner Middle School in Midtown Manhattan. On the one hand Wagner had a school band that played at Carnegie Hall every spring; it also claimed a new crop every year who took it upon themselves to smash the windows of the nearby Starbucks. The parents who dropped their kids off the first morning of sixth grade came from all walks of life. Some weren’t around to care about the first day of school. Some dashed off to Wall Street. I remember agonizing over whether to get suede moccasins or black leather loafers. It seemed like a really vital decision at the time. I went with the latter.
I had gone shoe shopping straight from a boat ride around the Hudson River with my parents. My uncle had just gotten a mini sailboat and wanted to take us out. I remember the conversation that morning so clearly. I’d been born and raised in New York City and seen the World Trade Center only twice in my life (I’ve seen the Statue of Liberty once from a distance. Hard-core New Yorker.) It was about time I got acquainted with the Financial District. So off we went. My uncle docked the boat in the river, right in front of the towers, and we ate lunch. Imagine that.
On September 11, 2001, my mom brought me to Wagner for my second day of middle school, a little before 8 a.m. My memories of the morning are tainted by the pain of my new shoes. They turned out to be wholesale Made-in-China, man-made rather than leather. By second period my feet were torn apart, bloody and covered in blistering sores. I cursed Aldo for ruining everything.
Second period was French class. We were probably conjugating être when our teacher got a call. He seemed perplexed and told us to entertain ourselves while he stepped outside. We spent the better part of the next hour playing truth or dare while our teacher fielded phone calls and babysat. As far as I was concerned, nothing was wrong, and I’d just gotten a free period. We were all eleven years old and cell-phone-less, and downtown seemed worlds away.
Thirty blocks south, my mom was crowded around a television at her Park Avenue office, watching the first tower collapse over and over again. She stood, paralyzed, as her best friend and coworker received a phone call from the plane headed into the second tower, and watched live as her coworker’s sister flew to her death.
Third period rolled around, and the entire school was summoned to the auditorium. A voice at the front asked whether anyone had parents working in the World Trade Center. I can’t be sure how many hands flew up but I can remember that there were many of them. At one point, a flock of Humanities teachers surrounded a sixth-grader in the front row and quickly ushered her out of the auditorium. We later found out that both her parents worked at the Twin Towers, and we never saw her again.
At the time, my understanding of what had happened was that there had been a huge explosion of some sort, leading to the collapse of the Towers. I had faith that everything would be okay and that the people working at the World Trade Center would be rescued from beneath the rubble. I was confused when parents began trickling into our school ten minutes later, removing their children from classes.
Around 11 a.m., my mom and aunt arrived for my cousin and me. At this point my shoes were making it impossible to walk and I asked if there was any chance we could take a taxi home to Queens. My aunt tried to persuade my mom that we should sleep at their apartment nearby. My mom was resolute: we had to make our way to Astoria. End of story.
And so we walked. With each step in my Aldo clogs the coarse leather stabbed my insoles. We walked 17 blocks until we reached the entrance to the Queensboro Bridge. No cars were in sight; only crowded masses, huddled together and walking across in packs. It seemed like a mass exodus, the kind I’d then only known to associate with Holocaust memoirs and refugee narratives. Yet these New Yorkers moved with a frightening sort of nervous velocity, a collective panicked dash across an expanse that stretches about 7,500 feet between two boroughs of the fastest city on earth. People were walking fast. No one spoke, but everyone seemed to communicate with eyes peeking out from headscarves and surgical masks. Some stationed themselves at various points of the bridge, handing out cups of water. It seemed the last place to be hours after a terrorist attack on the city. But on everyone plowed.
Years later, sitting down to write about this day, I still associate the events of 9/11 with the blistering soles of my feet and the way my mom and I ran across that bridge with so many others. We were running above the water, just like days ago we’d been one of the last to sail in front of the Towers. In the thousands of times I’ve crossed that bridge by car since then, heading into the city for school, I’ve never once forgotten crossing it back the other way on foot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was supposed to be upperclassman registration day. Yet, rather than an atmosphere of excitement, anticipation, and first-day-of-school jitters, Erin B. Ashwell ’02 recalls that Tuesday afternoon as one rife with terror, confusion, and sadness. “I remember walking to Sever Hall…and I remember you could hear coverage of what was happening from table to table…there was certainly a lot of shock, disbelief, and anger.” While the Harvard campus may often seems like a bubble from the outside world, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 jarringly and cruelly shook the community from its complacency. As the United States approaches the 10th anniversary of the defining moment of the 21st century, many former Harvard students, as well as members of the faculty and administration, can still vividly remember exactly where they were and how the campus responded.
Much like the rest of the U.S., Harvard students spent that morning in a state of panic and confusion. As news of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington D.C. began to trickle in, students desperately scrambled for more information. Across campus, in bedrooms, common rooms, grilles, and tutors’ residences, members of the Harvard community gathered around televisions and radios to watch footage and hear coverage of the towers’ collapsing.  “All of the campus was in shock,” remembers Esther Y. Tian ’05, who first watched the coverage on her roommate’s T.V. Ashwell, much like many of her fellow students, was in disbelief when she received a forwarded CNN article from a friend. Alex Pasternack ’05 walked into the Freshman Dean’s Office for a meeting, but was immediately struck by the fact that “the manner of our conversation was so trifling in comparison to what happened that day.” Government department faculty member, New York native, and Stanfield Professor of International Peace Jeffry Frieden remembers that “[somebody said] to me that I looked white as a sheet. I know that I was in a state of shock. After all, it’s my hometown, and I had been in the [World Trade Center] probably hundreds of times.”
Almost immediately, students and faculty turned their attention to locating friends and family. “I ran into a friend who had thrown his phone through a window because he had a friend flying that day and couldn’t get in touch with him,” Ashwell says. Much like Ashwell’s classmate, members of the Harvard community grappled with technological difficulties throughout the day, as many phone lines and news websites were crippled with massive inflows of traffic. Freshmen and future blockmates Pasternack and Timothy H. Wong ’05 were both unable to reach their parents who worked downtown in New York City. “Growing up in New York City…it was such an icon. When I heard the towers had fallen, I couldn’t really believe it until I saw it,” Pasternack says. Meanwhile, as it was the last day of registration before classes, the administration scrambled to locate students who had not yet returned to campus. A small scare occurred when the school tried to locate Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics faculty who were supposed to fly to Los Angeles that morning, but fortunately their flight had been diverted.
Then-University President Lawrence H. Summers was on his way to the faculty club when he first heard the news; he spent the majority of the day preparing remarks for the afternoon service held in Tercentenary Theatre. “This was an attempt to break the social fabric of the United States,” Summers says, “and we could best do our part by carrying on with what we did.” In his afternoon address, Summers took great care to state clearly that even as the U.S. government struggled to figure out the source of the attack, the tragedy that had taken place was most certainly an attack, and not merely a blameless disaster. At The Crimson, Ashwell faced a similar naming dilemma as she wrote her editorial, “Understanding September 11th, 2001,” and wondered whether to call what had taken place a crime or an act of war. She ultimately chose the latter.
As the events unfolded throughout the day, the Holyoke Center was transformed into a command and information post for students and administration, while HUPD and the Operations Center increased their staff and patrols. Summers, beginning his first year as the President of Harvard, was briefed on any potential security threats. Like many other tall buildings around the Boston area, William James Hall was evacuated. In the spirit of maintaining normalcy, many classrooms and facilities remained open to allow students a place to congregate and watch the events as they unfolded. Crisis and counseling centers, supplied with food and televisions, popped up all over campus as a number of different communities hosted conversations and discussions about the day’s events.
Outside the gates of Harvard Yard, the city of Cambridge experienced a similar combination of panic and shock. Carole Horne, the general manager of the Harvard Bookstore, recalls eating lunch in the “mobbed” basement of Uno Chicago Grill and watching the events on TV with dozens of other Cambridge residents. “We decided not to close [the Harvard Bookstore] because we thought that people would want places to go and for things to seem as normal as possible. Many people came in and they really did seem to want a place to be with other people and try to get news.” Numerous buildings in neighboring Boston were evacuated and Logan Airport, the source of two of the four doomed flights, was immediately shut down for further investigation.
Anxieties about future security breaches abounded; as Horne recalls, “everyone on the street and in the store was wondering ‘will there be more?’” Ashwell remembers that as students gathered on Tercentenary Theatre for an address from Summers and the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, “we heard a plane fly overhead…everyone was wondering if this was a plane coming down on Harvard Yard.” Across the country, Harvard alumni with friends in downtown New York bombarded alumni email lists for news of their former classmates.
Some students immediately felt a need to provide whatever assistance they could. Esther Tian grabbed a water jug from her room, and with her roommate, set up a collection stand in front of Annenberg with some help from other students in her entryway. PBHA took notice of the collection, and in conjunction with Tian, spread the donation efforts to all of the upperclassman Houses. Reflecting on the outpouring of student support, Tian feels that the tragedy “really brought people together in this sort of shared experience and obviously it was a life-altering experience in many ways. It was very profound in that we knew we were witnessing history.” By and large, however, the students remained at a mental standstill.
The question subsequently arose as to whether or not the first day of classes would proceed the following day as planned. Some felt that one of the best ways to cope with the attacks would be to return to business as usual. Although he had originally been opposed to keeping registration day open, Summers believed that “engaging in regular rituals would be more comforting for people. Primarily, it was a determination not to allow this to induce any more paralysis than was necessary.” While the school ultimately decided to hold classes on September 12th as scheduled, many students still believed that a 24-hour pause was simply not enough time to process the previous day’s events. “Everything just kept going; life continued on. The first day of classes was the next day, so there wasn’t a whole lot of time to process it,” Pasternack says. Like many professional athletics teams, Harvard put all of its scheduled weekend games on hold.
For the following week, students congregated on repeat occasions to mourn those who had died in the attacks. That night, nearly 3,000 students gathered on Tercentenary Theatre in silence to reflect on the day’s events.  One of the most moving moments of the entire week took place a few days later on Friday night, as hundreds of students gathered with candles for nighttime vigils at University Hall and the Eliot House courtyard. Surrounded by their fellow classmates, students broke into song, including “The Star Spangled Banner,” “My Country, ’Tis of Thee,” and “Amazing Grace.”
In the wake of the attacks, members of the community soon began to notice changes around campus and the surrounding Boston area. With the school’s widely diverse student body, members of the Muslim and Middle Eastern community on campus worried about potential backlash. However, some students, such as Ronen Mukamel ’05, whose family consisted of Iraqi Jews transplanted to Israel, noticed more gradual changes, rather than an immediate shift. “My last name is Arabic…I feel like that reaction was not immediate. That was something that took time for me to formulate and understand how it had affected me, Israel, and my family.” After Logan Airport reopened, students took note of the increased security measures. “I remember in a lot of ways, the city changed dramatically after that…you’d see people with automatic weapons at the airport for the first time,” Ashwell remembers. One month later, during the preparations for Summers’ inauguration as President of the school, the question arose as to whether or not all attendees would be required to walk through security scanners similar to those at the airport. Summers remained firmly against the idea, saying, “It was very important that we not become a garrison state.”
The attacks of September 11 ultimately set a peculiar tone for the new school year. Professor Summers recalls that “[the freshman class] was certainly a sober group.” Looking back, alumni from that year’s freshman class perceive their post-9/11 experiences with differing opinions. Esther Tian feels that “it definitely brought the community closer together.” On the other hand, Tim Wong feels that perhaps because of the shock of 9/11, the class of 2005 was “less willing to take risks once that initial shock came in…we were kind of held back and reserved.” Pasternack agrees, saying that “this was a pretty formative moment for a class that was in a pretty formative moment already. It’s the beginning of college, and then the world changes.”
Alumni such as Ashwell and Pasternack remarked that they could not believe 10 years had gone by; their memories of that day remained vividly clear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I.
For me it starts, in my sixth grade English class, when we are talking about “The Outsiders” by S. E. Hinton, which is a book about some kids who have no parents. Mothers are coming and knocking on the door and taking their daughters out of class. My mother is flying over the Atlantic Ocean, with my grandmother, coming back home from Rome, which is where she is from. They had a layover in Switzerland. They are landing this afternoon.
It’s second period on Tuesday September 11, 2001. (Is there any way to say it without sounding melodramatic? That’s just what it was.) We have a special assembly, where they tell us what happened, or what they know. Rumors are spreading. A friend of mine claims that there is a bomb on top of New York City. In that way of children, we are certain we are all going to die, sooner rather than later. We never really expected to make it to our thirteenth birthdays, to lose our virginities, to go to college. We never really expected to stop being children.
I am thinking about my mother and my grandmother. Even when the principal says that they were American flights, national planes, I don’t really believe her.
II.
At cruising altitude, my mother and grandmother’s Swiss Air flight has been turned around and is going back to Geneva. The pilot says that there has been a catastrophe in New York. The pilot says they cannot land. He makes a joke, in that way that people make jokes in the time of tragedy, and says that he hopes they have enough fuel to return to Switzerland. I don’t know, even now, exactly what my mother and grandmother’s reactions are to these announcements. Later, we will laugh about the joke, about the fuel, not ever really certain.
Approaching the 10-year anniversary, now, on a summer’s evening and during a rainstorm, my parents and I go to a deli near our home on 75th Street and 1st Avenue. My mother, taking a bite of a hot dog, says, “I remember thinking: I’m never going to see them again. I remember thinking: I’m never doing this ever again; I am never leaving you.”
III.
I don’t remember much of what I wrote in my fourth grade journal, but I remember once writing that my mother was on a business trip in Washington, D.C., and that, probably like most children, I didn’t like it when she went away. I didn’t like it when she flew. Maybe like many urban children, I was an anxious kid.
A few years later, a couple years after September 11th, my mother is diagnosed with breast cancer and I am sent to therapy. My therapist asks me to draw a diagram of my family—where are the strongest bonds? I draw a triangle, and I say, doesn’t she understand? All the bonds are strong. When there are only three people, they have to be strong, otherwise you can’t make a shape. She says, “exactly.”
As long as I can remember, my mother has said to me: “I will always be there for you.” But even as a child, a young child, I knew this wasn’t quite a lie, just a thing that was untrue.
IV.
Here’s what happened to me on September 11. My father came and picked me up from school. We bought milk at a supermarket on Madison Avenue that no longer exists, and we went to his office, which was on the first floor of a townhouse, because he didn’t want to go back to our apartment, on the 33rd floor, because we didn’t know if it was safe to be so high. We sat in his office listening to a transistor radio. Before, he removed $500 from his bank account. We got a call from a friend in Rome, explaining what had happened to my mother and my grandmother.
Finally, some hours later, we all talk to each other on the phone. What happens next is that my mother tries to get back to the States but she can’t. What happens next is that she doesn’t get to us until Sunday. I spend the next few days in the home of our downstairs neighbors, at a friend from school’s apartment, with my paternal grandparents. My father, a psychiatrist, goes back to work. We do strange things like go to synagogue, and my paternal grandmother and I make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for firefighters. On Wednesday morning, before my dad goes to the office, he walks me up to my friend’s house on Park Avenue and 92nd street. Looking down the avenues you can see the smoke. Finally, on Sunday, my mother comes home. She got a plane out of Zurich, having sent my grandmother back to Rome with all their luggage.
Here’s a thing I shouldn’t say: On the television, the night of September 11, all these people were saying, “We’re all New Yorkers tonight,” which was supposed to make us all feel better, like we weren’t alone. But I remember thinking: “No, no you’re not.”
V.
I’m hesitant to write this at all.
VI.
I am sitting in my father’s first floor office, listening to a transistor radio, not having yet heard from my mother. There’s a brown carpet and I’m sitting on the floor and he is sitting in the chair that swirls. All we do is make phone calls. I’m sitting on the floor. We have a transistor radio and I don’t know where we got it from. Even inside the small dark office it was sunny. I mean there’s things that you can’t really say. We lost our virginities, went to college, turned thirteen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
September 11, 2001 is often described as a sunny day interrupted by the sudden crashing of airplanes into two of the country’s most iconic buildings. The jet fuel melted concrete. Bodies tumbled from windows.
The events of that day made little sense at the time—and it is still difficult to assign them meaning. Somehow, a group of bearded men in caves in Afghanistan had been able to strike a blow at the world’s most powerful nation.
For a generation that had known nothing but 1990s peace and prosperity, 9/11 has come to represent, in one way at least, a loss of innocence. It is most likely this that the term “9/11 generation” refers to.
For us, children in 2001, that day made even less sense. Most teachers didn’t honestly address what had happened. Some kids were just happy to get an unforeseen recess. But even if that day wasn’t experienced in its stark reality, 9/11 has served as the backdrop for the coming of age of young people today.
In short, that moment of crisis represents the defining event of a generation—even if young people’s memories of that day involve blithely playing on a playground, images of parents glued to television screens, and the sudden appearance of American flags on every house.
That day, America coalesced around a shared enemy. And the feeling of brotherly love led to thousands of people rushing to New York City and Washington D.C. to aid the recovery effort. It also led to violent reprisals against this country’s real and perceived enemies.
Whether it involved manufacturing “9/11—Never Forget” bumper stickers, Red Cross blood drives, or military recruitment, American culture rallied around supplying its citizens with the tools to express newly acquired patriotic fervor. Even if the feelings that motivated the purchase of that bumper sticker have dissipated, the bumper sticker remains on the back of cars around this country. It would be uncomfortable to peel one off.
So the outward appearance of sentiment—the flag pin of it—remains today, even if it has become hollow. The very real emotion that led to the proliferation of American flags has by and large faded. All such feelings do.
What we’re left with is the gravestones of a forgotten feeling—a schmaltzy Americana—that weighs down our cultural moment. By examining the timeline of our post-9/11 patriotism and seeing its proliferation in culture, we can best understand what it has meant for young people today. In cultural items as different as country pop, prime-time TV, and the 7th inning stretch, we can see the shadow of lost belief.
BOTTOM SEVEN
The fall of 2001 was a season of surprising reversals for the United States, and that October a most improbable thing happened—America started rooting for the Yankees. Overnight the country began to grasp for all that was familiar and comforting, venturing into its closet of dusty traditions and trying on baseball, which fit the national mood with the reliability of an old mitt.
Soon after, Major League Baseball mandated that “God Bless America” be sung in every game for the rest of the season, and in some cases the song replaced the hallowed classic “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” Sports schmaltz, then, was replaced or overshadowed by patriotic schmaltz in a direct response to 9/11. Today, the Yankees, Braves, Mariners, and Dodgers still play the song every game, and it’s been instituted league-wide that the postseason games include the song. For baseball to regain its status as The National Pastime, it needed a symbol.
Doris Kearns Goodwin, a prominent American historian, is also one of our country’s foremost baseball fanatics. “It was sort of a requirement in the year afterwards,” says Goodwin of “God Bless America” in baseball. “People were rooting for the Yankees, incomprehensibly, even myself.” Goodwin believes that baseball’s symbolic importance had relevance directly after 9/11, comparable to the power of having an American flag for parents of soldiers.
That “God Bless America” has become a requirement, however, changes its meaning. “You shouldn’t have to prove your patriotism by that kind of symbol,” Goodwin says.
Associate Professor in the Literature Department and former New York resident Christopher Johnson sees this patriotic ritual in broad terms, as endemic in contemporary culture. Another example is criticism in 2008 that Barack Obama was not wearing a flag pin; another is Congress’ 2003 decision to coin the phrase “Freedom Fries” for fried potatoes served in the Capitol Hill dining hall; another is the recent debate over whether a mosque near Ground Zero was too symbolically distasteful. The seed was planted with 9/11, which was perceived as the ultimate attack on American symbols, rebuking freedom and The American Way.
“[It’s] a question between depth and surface. These are all superficial manifestations of what it means to have patriotism or any other deeply held belief. Are we satisfied merely with the singing of ‘God Bless America’ before the commercial in between the top of the 7th and the bottom of the 7th?” Johnson asks. Once a symbol becomes what Goodwin calls a “ritual,” it loses the substance underneath, becomes mandatory though not by virtue of its meaning. “[Mere symbolic activity] means that we found ways to short-circuit debate and sustain dialogue. It’s a way of saying, ‘This is sufficient,” Johnson says.
This decision just after 9/11 to reinvest patriotic meaning in baseball—the great American sport of the country’s great past—is the most direct and obvious retreat to nostalgia. And in baseball, it is most clear how this nostalgia has changed since its first use as a post-9/11 palliative into a national weakness. “Nostalgia has ideological uses, interesting ones, important ones,” cautions Johnson. All the worse if we’re using it against ourselves.
THE AMERICAN BOOT
The language of cultural degeneration, of nostalgia for frontier America, finds its most obvious contemporary placeholder in pop country. The recent revival of country music began before 9/11, with groups like the Dixie Chicks and singers like Shania Twain who rose to fame in the early 1990s. By the turn of the century, however, rap music and more conventional pop had gained almost complete dominance over the Billboard 200 charts. From Sept. 11, 1999 to Sept. 11, 2001, Tim McGraw’s “Greatest Hits” and the Dixie Chicks’ “Fly” were the only two country albums that managed to stay in the top 10 for five total weeks. To give a sense of perspective, “Nutty Professor II: The Klumps” soundtrack stayed in the top 10 for six weeks.
But 90s country had no robust connection to grassroots Americana. The Dixie Chicks began as a group of left-wing buskers, and Shania Twain is Canadian.
Since 9/11, mass-market country has undergone a radical shift. It’s useful to separate modern pop country into two categories: pop country for pop fans and country for country fans. Between these two categories, there’s been a unified series of changes: country has grown more mainstream—or more accurately, the mainstream audience has grown more country. At the same time, pop country has become lyrically committed to cultural conservatism, patriotic nostalgia, and Americana; and its sensibility as a genre has been refined, made distinct, and become singular, to the direct exclusion of other views on politics and culture.
This is less obvious in the upper echelons of country pop success, that stratosphere occupied by Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood. Their appeal is historic: Swift has enjoyed the longest Billboard 200 stay in a decade. Her eponymous debut album is in its 246th week on the charts at the time of writing. Swift’s debut single, “Tim McGraw,” is composed solely of acoustic guitar chords, and the music video prominently features a Chevy and cornfields (which, incidentally, also make up the cover of “Some Hearts”). Underwood’s allegiance to Americana country is more obvious than Swift’s. While most of her songs deal with the typical problems of romance (let’s just get away from this place! If you cheat on me I’ll wreck your car!), some of her most successful songs are the explicitly religious “Jesus Take the Wheel” or the superlatively American “All-American Girl.” No explanation required.
This is the most popular music in the U.S. right now, but it’s only a light version of country music for country fans. This type of country music has concerned itself deeply and directly with protecting what it sees as The American Way. Zac Brown Band’s “Chicken Fried” is typical of this myopic worldview. Its lyrics catalogue the totems of patriotism: “a cold beer on a Friday night,” fried chicken, “the stars and stripes,” and a “salute” to the military.
Some country music has explicitly taken on 9/11 and those who criticized the Iraq war. The namesake and title track of Darryl Worley’s album “Have You Forgotten?”, which made it to number four on the Billboard 200 in 2003, takes direct aim at his perceived opponents. “Some say this country’s just out looking for a fight,” Worley sings of Iraq war detractors, “Well, after 9/11 man I’d have to say that’s right.” “Don’t you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden,” he adds, “Have you forgotten?”
Worley is not contrasting two political options but two ways of seeing the world, one in which “just out looking for a fight” is nonsensical and another in which it is admirable. The key word here is “you,” the singling out and warning of the other side, the implication that to not support the war is to have “forgotten.” In this scheme, we get a clear right and wrong in flatly threatening tones.
“Us” and “them” can also be presented vaguely. “American girls and American guys, will always stand up and salute,” sings Toby Keith in “Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue (The Angry American).” “You’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A,” he cautions later, “‘Cause we’ll put a boot in your ass, it’s the American way.”
Keith, like Worley and the Zac Brown Band, is proscribing a singular notion of what it is to be an American: a notion in which unfailing patriotism and citizenship are equated. In Keith’s song, the “you” enemy seems most literally to be referring to enemies in the Middle East, but notably is never defined. So, it can be applied to anything: communists could see this “you” as financiers, and Zionists could see it as enemies of Israel. Understood on the song’s own terms, however, the undefined “you” refers to all departures from Keith’s concept of “the American way.” When Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines called “Courtesy” “ignorant,” Keith put up a photoshopped image of her and Saddam Hussein at a concert.
Country music is devoted to a traditional vision of America, one that is being outmoded technologically and challenged militarily and economically. Its musical kinship to this past—stark in an era of synths—and its lyrical excitement at fighting for this past insist that our traditions are safe, that we as a people will fight to protect the values our parents, grandparents, and Mayflower sailors held dear. It is a nostalgic vision for what America should be.
LOST COMPLETELY IN IT
But country music does not have the only claim to the great American past.
The success of “Mad Men” has spawned a whole new genre in American television of mid-century revivalism. 2010’s hit series “Boardwalk Empire” and the upcoming premieres of “Playboy Club” and “Pan Am” are four high-budget television shows that impose a rose-tinted lens on the past. These shows are deeply concerned with a superficial depiction of the social politics of the 50s.
That “Playboy Club” and “Pan Am” seek to reproduce the “Mad Men” model is comically clear from their trailers. In eager nods to their Greatest Generation mood, both trailers open with a Sinatra standby—“Town Like This” for “Playboy Club” and “Around the World” for “Pan Am.”
In the first scene of the “Pan Am” trailer, a bride-to-be decides that conventional married life isn’t for her, and drives away to become a Pan Am stewardess. This takes eight seconds. Over the next 36 seconds, we go through a montage of various Pan Am stewardess activities—being whisked up and kissed, running hurriedly with multiple bags, being weighed on a scale by a spare female boss (“Are you wearing your girdle?”), gossiping about Life Magazine, gossiping about husbands, complaining about gossip about husbands. We run through a dizzying number of different leggy women. Then, a few boss male figures talk big business.
“Playboy Club” is similarly concerned with creating a playful atmosphere and highlighting petty concerns. A black playboy bunny who wants to be the company’s first black centerfold, a starstruck bunny who has begun making more money than her father, a man in a suit who wants Marlboro Reds.
“People are nostalgic for a time when the country seemed much more confident,” says New York Times television critic Alessandra Stanely, who has been on the TV beat since 2003, when she left her job as a foreign correspondent, having been the chief of the Rome and Moscow bureaus.
For Stanley, these shows mark a new kind of interest in the past that only makes sense for a post-9/11 audience. “‘M*A*S*H’ wasn’t really about Korea, it was concerned with people stuck in [Vietnam]. ‘Happy Days’ was poodle skirts and music everyone loves ... but the relationships and the adolescent angst was pretty contemporary.” Then, historical TV shows had interest in the past only insofar as they could find attractive and inoffensive ground to explore issues of its own day. The great sitcoms of yesteryear generally sought to give a certain or even total vision of their own era—“I Love Lucy,” “All in the Family,” and “The Cosby Show” are only a few examples.
The “Mad Men” brand does not seek to recast the past—it seeks to be lost completely in it. “We know prohibition and know that sexism got more or less redressed,” Stanley says of the main issues raised in “Mad Men” and “Boardwalk Empire.” “It’s compelling now because we’re in a difficult time and we don’t feel powerful, so it’s fun to look at eras where the country seemed more on the ascent.”
These shows, then, have a double function for viewers today. First, they allow us an escape from our present into self-contained periods in the past. Neither “Mad Men” nor “Boardwalk Empire” have any concern with what their periods mean to contemporary viewers. Instead, they want to make the past beautiful—to make the suits tailored, the women elongated, the office desks shined. In these shows, we see how the rich and powerful were able to control the culture of our country’s greatest age—the ad men of the 50s, the bootleggers of the 20s. The strong male protagonists of these shows are able to control their environment completely and allow the viewer to imagine themselves as Don Draper, the man who can seduce any woman and sell any product. Both of these shows are set in a time of American greatness, and their leading men embody the American ideal of the self-made man.
Even the problems of these eras are unserious, aesthetic. Sexism, the political division of choice, is enacted before only in its most blatant form—openly harassed secretaries, unapologetically cuckolded wives—so we can see something we have conquered. The past was pretty, we understand, and its gravest challenges have become punchlines. This kind of understanding is only appealing to an audience openly cheating on the present with the past, to a culture that has traded novelty for nostalgia. So in a post-9/11 era, these leading men carry a special appeal. Namely, they are in complete control, which stands in stark contrast the contemporary world of American decline and uncertainty about the future. What happened one day 10 years ago didn’t create this attitude, but it was the decisive event that created the culture that made it possible.
Without 9/11, there would not be this impulse to turn away from today.
I RAISE MY HAND, I TURN MY HEAD
To understand how 9/11 has shaped today’s hollow patriotism, it is necessary to understand the immense feelings of national togetherness that followed the attacks, a feeling that quickly withered away into a meaningless sense of crisis.
For Robert Putnam, Harvard professor and author of “Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community,” this came in the form of widespread communal trust, sympathy, and connectivity. Americans felt a need to stand together in the face of a threat. “If we had a national hug index, that would have skyrocketed in the weeks following 9/11,” Putnam says.
Following the attacks on Pearl Harbor, there was a rush to enlist in the army; broad national support for a tax increase to aid the war effort; and steely acceptance of gasoline and food rations. Then, the country was amenable to making material sacrifices for the sake of the war effort and the abstractions of patriotism, says Doris Kearns Goodwin, a prominent American historian. These teenagers of the late 30s, now called The Greatest Generation, grew up valuing a dollar and a neighbor like one had to during the Great Depression. Even in times of prosperity, they continued to be more civically engaged than their parents or their children. Today, they vote at higher rates than any other age demographic, walkers and nurses in tow.
There was a critical moment, then, after 9/11, when the broad thematic strokes of our generation would be decided. Briefly, community-mindedness surged as groups of people came together around a sense of shared trauma. The opportunity to permanently strengthen these communities, however, passed us by. At a time when Americans could have been called upon to make sacrifices for their country, all that was asked of them by then-President George W. Bush was to go on living their lives as they had before the attacks, maybe taking the kids down to Walt Disney World.
“I think the adults this time failed your generation,” Putnam says. “We did not behave in ways that would encourage your generation to participate in civic life ... I was extremely hopeful that your generation could turn around civic renewal.” According to Putnam, six months after the attack levels of community trust were back to their original, pre-9/11 baseline.
On the night of Sunday, May 1, college students across the country erupted into a celebration at the news that Osama bin Laden had been killed by American military forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Two-hundred undergrads spontaneously gathered in Harvard Yard, waving American flags and chanting “U—S—A” after Barack Obama announced bin Laden’s death. That night marked the end of a decade-long manhunt for a generational boogeyman, an apparent evil for evil’s own sake who had brought us into adult consciousness.
For a moment, the patriotism that has lost its meaning since 9/11—in popular music, television, even in baseball—was revitalized. The group chanting that night was reminiscent of marches in the 60s, rioting in the 80s, events that have gained the status of folklore for people under 30. The energy was contagious.
But on May 2, patriotic symbols began to turn stale once more, repeating what took place in the years after 9/11.
In Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963 movie “Vivre Sa Vie,” the protagonist proclaims, “I think we’re always responsible for our actions. We’re free. I raise my hand—I’m responsible. I turn my head to the right—I’m responsible. I’m unhappy—I’m responsible. I smoke a cigarette—I’m responsible. I shut my eyes—I’m responsible. I forget that I’m responsible, but I am.“ Putnam is right that adults failed us, and omnipresent pop culture has capitalized on our need to escape the U.S. of today, heavy with mythos and light on power. It’s nighttime in America, and it feels best to think of better times. The only way out, however, really and finally out, is to take the responsibility we believed we could once have. Nostalgia not for its own sake, but as the tool to reconstruct our own times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Her blond, shoulder length hair pulled back in a half ponytail, Sharon K. Kelleher '14 recalls the first time she heard the word “terrorist.”
“I was in gym class, and we were line dancing actually, of all things.”
In the years to come, terrorism would become a constant presence in her life, inextricably linked with the death of her uncle, Edward R. Hennessy ’88—the man who lived down the street throughout her childhood and sparked her passion for the piano. Edward, known by friends and family as Ted, was a passenger on American Airlines flight 11, which departed from Boston’s Logan International Airport on September 11, 2001 and was the first of the planes to crash into the World Trade Center.
The day after, fighter jets patrolled the air, visible from Central Park, even though the skies were grayed from airborne debris. People on the streets wore facemasks. New York felt silent.
throughout her childhood and sparked her passion for the piano. Edward, known by friends and family as Ted, was a passenger on American Airlines flight 11, which departed from Boston’s Logan International Airport on September 11, 2001 and was the first of the planes to crash into the World Trade Center.
For the public and the media, the 10th anniversary of 9/11 has become a marker of the change of an era in American history, a time when a blustering world power lost some of its innocence. But for the families of the victims, this anniversary is similar to this day every year, a time when they are torn between the public spectacle of remembering 9/11 and the private grief of losing a family member.
“For me, personally, my brother’s death and 9/11 are almost two separate events,” says Susan D. Kelleher, Ted’s sister. “I think of his death as so personal and this whole 9/11 thing is so public.”
Ted’s mother Gerry M. Hennessy’s voice trembles as she says, “Just another day, you know—another day that he’s gone.”
Violetta Demas, whose husband Anthony Demas worked in the South Tower, describes September 11 as “‘a day of infamy,’ as Franklin Roosevelt said. I don’t think there are better words for it than that.”
CONFRONTING TRAGEDY
When in ninth grade, Sharon was asked to write about whom she would choose to talk to if she could have a conversation with anyone, dead or alive. She chose Osama bin Laden.
“I still can’t wrap my mind around it at all,” she says.
“I was only 10 when it happened. So I was old enough to know what had happened but young enough that I didn’t understand the larger implications of the actual tragedy,” Sharon says. “I just remember hating. Just hating whoever had done it and not knowing who they were.”
Over the years, she says her hatred became sadness and pity for those who were responsible for the attacks, but the transformation was slow, one without a definite beginning.
Ted’s death was not the first loss the Hennessy and Kelleher family experienced. In 1971, Ted’s oldest sister, after whom Sharon is named, died in a car crash.
“When Ted died it was just unbelievable that we’d have another child die on us,” Gerry says. “I got very run down, and I had a heart attack very shortly after that. It just took the life out of us.”
For many, especially those who were younger at the time and lost a parent in the attacks, Sept. 11, 2001 and the days and weeks that followed were a time of deep confusion.
In the household of Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12, the days after the attack were characterized by waiting. Waiting to hear something—anything—concrete about her father.
“No one knew if my dad was somewhere in a triage. There were the missing person signs everywhere,” Elizabeth says.
Elizabeth’s father, Dennis G. Moroney, died in the North Tower.
Elizabeth was 11 on Sept. 11, 2011. She went back to school within the week, diligently continuing to do her homework as a way to keep her mind occupied. The family held a memorial service for Dennis sometime in October, at which Elizabeth played her flute.
“I don’t know at what point we just stopped waiting around,” she says.
Afterwards, Elizabeth began participating in a bereavement program in her community, as well as in groups at Tuesday’s Children, a non-profit organization that supports individuals impacted by the events of 9/11.
Most importantly, her family came together after the tragedy.
“My brother, my mom, and I got a lot closer afterwards. We sort of coped with it by focusing on each other and on everyone else in our family,” Elizabeth says.
THE LIVES OF THE VICTIMS
As the healing process continues, the Kelleher, Hennessy, Moroney and Demas families say that they are trying to keep in mind the positive milestones that have taken place since Sept. 11—the marriages and graduations—instead of dwelling on the horror of the attacks.
“I’m always very focused on keeping my spirits uplifted, as my husband would have wanted me to do, and not be mired in the sadness of it,” says Violetta, whose husband attended the School of Continuing Education in 1979.
A critical aspect of remaining optimistic is keeping the spirit of their family members alive.
“They don’t ever shy away from talking about him,” Sharon says of her family’s treatment of Ted’s death.
Susan recalls her brother’s sense of humor. “He was so funny, but he was so smart that he would tell jokes and sometimes would have to look up the words in the dictionary.”
“We were so grateful to have him for the time that we did,” Gerry says.
Elizabeth tries to do the same, although the fact that she was so young when her dad died makes remembering him more difficult.
“Most of my memories are after that date,” she says, her voice faltering.
But she does have a few images that come to mind when she thinks of her father.
“When we lived in England we visited France and he had me order him a beer in French, and then we tried escargot together. I was like seven or eight,” Elizabeth says, laughing.
SEPTEMBER 11 IN THE MEDIA
When most families lose a loved one, the mourning and healing process is intensely personal. But for the families of those who died on 9/11, their grief has played out on a very public stage.
Since that day, the media has been a constant presence in the families’ lives, creating a collective memory of the attacks. But the media has also tried to exploit the events of 9/11, and that has had very real consequences for victims’ families.
“The media is really important in fueling it, fueling the fact that it’s remembered and that no one forgets what happened,” Sharon says. But, she adds, “It kind of depends on the way that it’s portrayed.”
The families say there is a difference between positive, respectful coverage, and attention that is decidedly hurtful.
In high school, Elizabeth and her friend were at a movie theater when a preview for World Trade Center came on screen. “I just walked out of the movie theater until it was done,” Elizabeth recalls. “It’s a little weird that it’s used as a theme for action movies. I definitely see why people would use it as a theme for a movie to capture national sentiment or express a point. But the extreme violence that’s depicted—I think that’s just gratuitous.”
However, the media will always be there. “You can’t stop it,” Violetta says, resigned.
Violetta, like the Kellehers, has never spoken to the press before.
“You’re the first interview I’m giving,” she says. “And I’m doing it because my sons thought it would be the right thing to do since their father loved Harvard.”
Susan’s reason for giving her first interview is the same: Harvard.
“Harvard was a huge turning point for him,” Sharon says of her uncle. “He became so involved and found his people and his niche.”
While at Harvard, Ted was in the marching band and co-wrote the Hasty Pudding Theatricals show in ’89, titled “Whiskey Business.” His mother and sister chuckle as they recall the subject of the play: Italian gangsters.
“We were in the front row,” says Susan as her laughter trails off.
Speaking about her daughter, Sharon, Susan admits, “She wouldn’t be there right now if it wasn’t for Ted.”
But the families’ decisions to open up to the press do not necessarily signal a desire to bring their loss into the public spotlight.
Elizabeth and Sharon met each other last year in US and the World 32: “The World’s Religions in Multicultural America: Case Studies in Religious Pluralism.” During a class discussion, Elizabeth brought up her connection to the attacks, which prompted Sharon to stop her after class and share her experience.
Neither woman knows of other students in the Harvard community who lost a family member in the towers—the attacks are not a subject they often bring up in conversation.
Breaking that silence, Elizabeth has decided to speak at the College-wide vigil to be held in Memorial Hall today.
“I’m just really hoping that if people read this or if people hear my story, that they can just think about why people hate and what we can do to have a more peaceful society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a successful opening weekend in the Georgia State Invitational, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (4-2) had hopes for an even stronger showing this weekend.
On Friday evening at the Bryant Invitational, such dreams became reality, as the squad toppled both Holy Cross and Bryant. However, Saturday proved to be a different story, whose conclusion left the Crimson with a disappointing loss and a second 2-1 finish in as many weeks.
MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE 3, HARVARD 0
Despite Harvard’s stellar start in the first two games of the Invitational, a perfect finish was just not in the cards for the Crimson, which was blanked by the Hawks (the eventual tournament winner).
After falling behind in the opening set, Harvard was never able to recover and conceded losses of 25-18, 25-19, and 25-16, respectively.
“UMES came at us with a different style of attack,” co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer said. “It took us a while to adjust ... and we felt like we were all working hard but just weren’t getting the job done.”
The numbers told the story of the game, with the Hawks recording a superb 18 kills in the first set, while Harvard only mustered five.
The second set was more even—each team posted nine kills—after the Crimson jumped out to an early 3-0 lead, before the Hawks rallied with a 7-1 run midway through the game to gather the momentum for a second-set victory.
The run was started by a trio of aces by Maryland Eastern Shore, which had only seven on the match. Harvard fought back in what would be the final set, leveling the playing field at 6-6, before the Hawks took a lead that it never lost.
The Crimson fell behind for good when the Hawks pulled ahead, 16-10, and won only six more points before losing the game and match, 25-16.
“We never really showed up [on Saturday], and we didn’t adapt to Maryland’s level of play,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We didn’t play Harvard volleyball.”
HARVARD 3, BRYANT 1
Coming off a dominant win against the Crusaders, Harvard entered its second match of the night against Bryant, which was reeling from a 3-1 loss against Maryland Eastern Shore.
The Crimson took the first two sets handily, 25-17 and 25-22, respectively, before Bryant fought for life in the third, turning the tables for a 25-22 victory.
Although it started behind in the fourth set—no doubt reviving the memories of its past fourth-set woes—Harvard squashed any chance of a comeback in the game, claiming a final 25-19 score, secured by a couple of kills by freshman Kristen Casey and a kill from sophomore Teresa Skelly.
It was the second set in a row in which Skelly—who recorded 21 kills on Friday—delivered the final blow.
“We had two back-to-back matches on Friday night that were physically exhausting,” Fryhofer said. “But we came together, found fuel in the reserve tank, and came out on top. That was a good night for us.”
The Crimson was led by Casey, who posted 15 kills and three service aces in the win, and Wu, who added 28 digs.
HARVARD 3, HOLY CROSS 0
In its first match of the night, Harvard took the first set in a competitive 25-22 game and never looked back, winning the subsequent sets, 25-12 and 25-20, respectively.
The Crimson’s victory in the first game did not come easily, though, after it dropped the opening three points and fell behind, 12-5, halfway through the set.
Harvard was done but not out and fought back to finally take the lead at 20-19 after its offense—led by junior Taylor Docter and Skelly—woke up.
The offense kicked into full gear in the second set, owning a match-best .394 hitting percentage with 18 kills.
In the third and final frame, the Crusaders tried to rally, evening the score midway at 13, but kills by Skelly and sophomore Erin Cooney and an ace by Wu sparked enough momentum for the Crimson to earn its first win of the weekend.
“We knew what it took to beat [Holy Cross],” Wu said. “We knew we didn’t need to play down to their level and ... we wanted to stay in our system and play our game.”
Skelly spearheaded the Crimson offense, recording 11 kills, while junior Beth Kinsella contributed 35 assists. Wu and sophomore Natalie Doyle bulwarked the defense with 13 digs apiece.
“This tournament was a good one for us because it gave us a look at different teams and prepares us for the Ivy League,” Wu said. “We’ll have to learn how to adapt to other teams, but at the end of the day, any game time experience allows us to get our kinks out of the system.”

Beauty, talent, and brains reign supreme for Isha H. Jain '12, who made Glamour Magazine’s list of "Top 10 College Women" for her lifelong work in the biological fields and involvement in Harvard's National Symposium for the Advancement of Women in Science. Jain was prompted to enter Glamour's competition by her pre-frosh host at MIT, who was also a winner of the award. Jain said her interest in science was sparked by role model and Nobel Prize winner Elizabeth Blackburn, whose articles inspired Jain as a seventh grader. 
After her application was considered based on a variety of qualifications including merit, leadership, and service, Jain underwent a long interview process last spring.  Jain was on campus with her mother when she receiving the call with the good news.
 "We screamed and danced a little bit," Jain admited. 
Jain wanted people to know, that while she was deemed "the scientist" by Glamour, she is anything but a lab rat.
"I dance a lot, make jewelry, and play soccer. I was excited about the award because it shows young girls that science can be glamorous and not just a dorky field with big glasses and a lab coat," Jain said.
