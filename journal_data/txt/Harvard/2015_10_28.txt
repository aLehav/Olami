After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How are you? No, how are you, actually?
This is the most important question we can ask each other. I came to this realization when I was having breakfast with a friend: I asked how he was, and he shrugged, and said, “I’m okay.”
“How are you, actually?”
And there it was. That one little word made a world of difference. We found ourselves having an open, honest conversation, in which we shared our struggles and gave each other advice. In that moment, I realized the power of one little word—a word that meant that I cared about how my friend was doing, and didn’t simply want to hear that he was “fine.”
Lately, our campus has been having conversations expressing the need for a community more conducive to our mental well-being. Unfortunately, this talk hasn’t led to much action. Sitting and stewing in our anger about what needs to be done won’t effect change; we must take it upon ourselves to create the very outlet we desire.
There’s been a lot of fantastic discussion about how Harvard needs open spaces and forums, like study breaks and peer-led groups, where people can confront issues they may otherwise be afraid to address. I’m completely in favor of creating these spaces, but the Harvard student body needs more than that; we need an entirely open atmosphere—one where students don’t feel judged sharing their thoughts over dining hall lunches, or even in passing in the hallway. And that openness exists on an individual level, not simply on a large scale.
We are accustomed to hiding behind facades of “good” and “happy.” We tell others we’re “fine,” because we’re afraid of being judged for any other answer. It’s important for our community to have access to many self-care resources, but it’s even more important to be able to admit that we’re not fine to one another. We have the power to check in with others and ask how they’re truly doing, and take five minutes to listen to what they have to say.
Of course, this change is more daunting than it sounds. Checking in seems like an onerous, time intensive task. Every student here is busy, and not everyone necessarily has the time to take a break and see how a friend is doing. Even more intimidating, people feel that they won’t know what to do if a friend presents a problem and needs advice. Because of these fears, people shy away from asking others how things are, or whether there’s anything they can do to be of help. But the act of asking—of caring—is intrinsically helpful. By taking the extra minute to see how someone is really doing, beyond the masks of “fine” and “great,” we show someone we care. And exposing someone else to the vulnerability that comes with a truthful answer is just as meaningful.
In a setting where everyone is striving to be the best, it’s easy to get caught up in our own worlds. We have this weird idea that acknowledging our limitations and asking for help is equivalent to personal weakness and ineptitude. The intersection of this perfectionistic environment and misconception that reaching out for help is a character flaw makes people afraid to reach out to others, and afraid to see how others are doing. We each have the power to remove the stigma associated with imperfection—let’s start by listening, instead of merely hearing, and asking for help when we feel stuck.
Harvard, I challenge you to ask for honesty. I challenge you to stop asking, “How are you?” and start asking, “How are you, actually?” And I challenge you to respond with anything but, “I’m fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes I worry about Drake.
I don’t mean like, whether or not he’s eating enough leafy greens. (Judging by how fit he’s looked on Instagram, it seems like he is.)
It’s a few things really.
I worry about how much credit Drake gets for being, essentially, a kind and hot dad-of-a-guy, sensitive and well meaning, just looking out for women. According to his lyrics, though, he’s not. He’s often kind of creepy. He’s been in the business of telling women how they should and are allowed to be long before “Hotline Bling,” but the viral technicolor jam best illuminates his patent patronizing, patriarchal tone.
“Hotline Bling,” in short:
Drake and a woman used to be involved. The woman would call Drake, often, for late night love. As you do. But then things changed. Whatever was between them ended.
The woman: You and I are no longer involved and we don’t even live in the same place anymore. I’ve moved on and—
Drake: I’ve noticed you wear fewer clothes now. This must be a direct result of how you and I no longer living in the same city. Also, who are your new friends? Why don’t I know them? You used to be a good girl! You used to stay at home!!!
The woman: Drake, that’s kind of sexist. And how do you even know what I wear these days? I thought I blocked you??
Drake: Why don’t you ever call me anymore?
The woman: Drake we aren’t even dating or anything I don’t—
Drake: **elevator music outro**
His anti-feminist politics are my first worry, for sure. Then comes, related, and a little more complicated, the worry I feel about the white feminist perception of Drake, of the inevitable white think pieces about black misogyny.
And worse, how everything under the white gaze these days feels like consumption to me. The other day I sat out of a talk I wanted to go to because I just couldn’t take a room full of queer white people consuming a queer person of color. It would have just been listening, but it would have felt like a buffet, a crowd picking their teeth with familiar bones.
It feels almost the same when the white people behind me in the dining hall are sitting around a laptop laughing at the “Hotline Bling” video (not even parody vines or anything, but the original damn video, this late in the game). A girl says, “Gosh, look at all those butts. Usually, at least, there’s a reason for all the butts.” There are no women, apparently, attached to said butts. Afterwards, I imagine the people at the table sucking their teeth clean.
I’m worried about all of that tiring personal political stuff, and I’m tired of being tired. A white guy walked up to my group of friends the other day and started joking about “oppression” and my body physically started aching. Maybe it’s just flu season. Either way, I left. So I don’t want to talk about that stuff. I want to talk about love.
In high school, Drake’s “Nothing Was the Same” became a girl for me, as did the entire city of Atlanta, as albums and cities tend to do when you are a teenager and in love and good at ascribing big meanings to big things. I don’t really listen to that album anymore, because of this, but I can remember sitting in my cheesy-ass baby blue Honda civic in front of a bad sushi restaurant in my hometown with my debate partner and best friend, listening to “Nothing Was the Same” start to finish. Even if I can’t listen to too many of those songs because of the girl, that memory and that album became part of the love I had and have for my best friend. We were the only two black girls in our friend group, always too loud and finding solace in bad music. We skipped class one day and drove somewhere unimportant, shouting the lyrics to a series of Big Sean songs, lyrics we knew were offensive to us specifically but clumsily reclaimed as ours. And that was love.
When I was around 12, we drove to Virginia to watch my genius mom defend her dissertation at Hampton University. For some reason, the entire drive was occupied by some odd CD of black wedding songs, (at a wedding this summer, my dad and I realized we didn’t even know how to guess what music they play at white weddings, the cannon of black wedding music our only reference point), and the only song my older brother and I wanted to listen to on the soundtrack was “When We Get Married,” the Larry Graham version, which is important because of those falsettos at the end. We were sick of being in the car together, my mom was a mess, my parents were only tenuously getting along . But whenever Larry Graham hit those high notes, my brother and I did too, and the whole car would crack up, and it wouldn’t matter if we were lost, or angry at each other, or generally broken. My mom cried during her defense, and so did a few others in the room. I kind of figured all dissertation defenses looked like that, all black and all proud, with desperate tears, but apparently they don’t. But that day, that was love.
All that my parents taught me about romance they taught me by giving me their music. The Supremes, Gladys Knight. My mom has always been a sucker for Luther Vandross. I have to remind myself that it would be misguided to worry about where Drake fits into that. I do really love Drake. Often, on the way to a particularly doing-too-much class, I listen to a playlist comprised almost entirely of Drake and become impenetrable. The lyrics are questionable, sure. They always are. But the songs make me feel huge, and sometimes that’s love.
The other day, some folks from Renegade got together to have a Tiny Dorm Concert. Rarely on this campus have I ever felt that warm. For my people, music is healing. Whether it’s “Trap Queen” or gospel. My parents have been trying to tell me this forever. For me, a good music video has rebuilt a shaky friendship. A single deep track could signal to the kids at a barbecue to go inside, leave the adults to the booze and sunset and citronella candles. An album has forged a bond. And right now, when the constant mental onslaught of being black and/or queer is too much for too many people, when there are videos floating around that could single-handedly end me, when for me and for many the stress registers physically, when checking my phone and getting out of bed and going to class is an Olympic act, as far as reprieves go, I am taking what I can get. And sometimes that’s love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Andre Smith hit his head on the final play of his Illinois high school’s football game. He got up, walked off the field, and made his way to the sideline. Then, he collapsed. The following morning, he died as the result of “blunt force head injuries due to a football accident.” He was 17 years old.
Smith’s death marks the 11th time a high school student has died as the result of a football related injury this year alone.
*****
Harvard spends over $400,000 annually in operating expenses for its football team to recruit high school players, pay coaches and staff, and maintain its facilities. On the surface, these expenditures are paying off: Last week’s 42-7 rout over Princeton was Harvard’s 20th straight win; we’ve won three of the last four Ivy League championships; we’ve beaten Yale eight straight times.
But if you look a little closer, it becomes clear that by maintaining a football team, Harvard is not simply risking the health of its players on a weekly basis, but threatening players’ mental and physical well being for the rest of their lives.
It’s time for the administration to disband Harvard Football.
Sure, not all football injuries lead to death, and of course, more often than not, players leave Harvard and enter the workforce without an easily discernible mental deficiency. But study after study has concluded that playing football—at the high school, college, and professional level—leads to brain damage, in the form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, post-concussion syndrome, depression, and other long-term head-related injuries.
Some argue that the way to address this problem is to increase awareness. But in spite of repeated efforts to encourage football players to be more cautious, college players still only report one in every 27 head injuries. Furthermore, according to a study conducted here at Harvard and Boston College, players still suffer six suspected concussions for every one diagnosed. Besides, even if we were to create a paradigm in which all concussions were reported, we’d come nowhere close to thwarting the detrimental effect college football has on players’ brains.
As Malcolm Gladwell argues in The New Yorker, citing concussion expert Robert Cantu, “It’s not just the handful of big hits that matter. It’s lots of little hits, too.” Anyone who has ever seen or played in a football game knows that little hits are an every play occurrence, as intrinsic to the game of football as cursing is to a Tarantino movie.
*****
As far back as I can remember. I’ve always been obsessed with football.
From the ages of five to 10, I played Madden religiously every Sunday, in an attempt to grow closer to my estranged relatives. My stoner uncle and estranged grandfather—whose roles in my life were practically nonexistent otherwise—would come over and play virtual football with me once a week. Always three minute quarters. Always set to Monday night football. No punts allowed. These games marked the highlight of my week.
From 10 to 13, I half-heartedly convinced myself I could play in real life. I joined a flag football league, began what I thought of as a rigorous regimen of push-ups and sit-ups (100 a day), and learned to run for more than a mile at a time. But some part of me always knew I wasn’t serious. I was short. I was a little tubby. I was slow as shit.
From 14 to 18, fantasy became my preferred method of football consumption and I managed my team as though it were my job. Having quit real life football, I savored the chance to compete on the newest iteration of a football field: ESPN’s Live Fantasy Cast.
I never had a real chance of playing tackle football—my mom was too neurotic and my biceps were too small to let that happen. But I never stopped paying attention to the sport, because football has always given me pure, unadulterated joy. Which is to say: I’m telling this story because even though I can never genuinely relate to football players, to some degree, I do get it. Football is not only fun, it’s valiant, It’s uniting. Something about it is undeniably magical.
But while I would hate to see football go, I now understand that it simply has little place in today’s society, especially at an educational institution like Harvard.
*****
College is supposed to be a time of intellectual exploration, centered on expanding students’ brains and preparing them to become fully grown citizens of the world. Football is not conducive to that mission. Stuck in your dorm room with a concussion, it’s hard—maybe even impossible—to get through your readings, or go over to a friend’s room and have a meaningful conversation. I’d know: I’ve had three serious concussions myself.
But perhaps even worse than the effects concussions have on the lives of Harvard football players is the number of high school students who put themselves at risk for the (really, really slim) chance of playing college football. According to a 2014 study in the American Journal of Sports medicine, almost 70 percent of high school athletes with concussions played despite their symptoms, over 40 percent of whom never told their coaches about the injury. According to another study, over 50 percent of concussions obtained in high-school male sports came from football.
Point being: Over one million high school students across the country risk their health—and, often, conceal their injuries—to play competitive football. If Harvard, and other schools that value education, shut down their football programs, one can only imagine how many more high school students would report their concussions, or stop playing football altogether.
As more information comes out about the dangers of football, high school students from upper-middle class backgrounds will be less inclined to play, while lower-class students may still feel forced to join football teams in spite of the risks. The coercive incentive structure that is starting to develop alongside the “ghettoization” of football is not unlike that of the military, where lower-class citizens often feel forced to put their bodies at risk for the chance of a college education. This incentive structure is tilted to favor the upper class.
Ultimately this debate comes down to a single question: Should Harvard, a school that’s mission is to provide students with a “transformational” education, really be rewarding high school students for playing a sport that risks their physical and mental well-being?
I think not, and I want Harvard, as well as any other schools that would be willing, to shut down their football teams now, so that young Americans like Andre Smith do not die in vain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before I quit as an organizer for the Harvard Graduate Student Union-UAW in late September, I heard consistent support of the union by graduate students. These supporters believe that the proposed student union will have many a positive impact on the Harvard community. I am skeptical.
My skepticism about the union derives not from a principle regarding student unionization per se, but from an objection against some of the main goals of the HGSU-UAW and the way the group has chosen to organize students at Harvard. There are still many unanswered questions and unvalidated assumptions about the proposed union that need to be addressed before we can make an informed decision on whether to support it.
As Julie Kushner, the director of the United Auto Workers’ region 9A, made clear at a town hall event last week, one primary goal of the movement is to secure greater benefits for graduate students. The HGSU-UAW’s organizing work is replete with populist rhetoric that paints Harvard as a powerful employer who exploits graduate students in order to maximize its gains; graduate students are engaged in a class warfare with the rich, greedy University—and it is only fair to claim a bigger slice of the pie they help produce.
Is this a fair indictment of the University? Graduate students at Harvard are already reasonably  compensated and to claim otherwise is lacking in perspective. When judging whether students receive a fair compensation for their work, we must take into account various forms of benefits the University provides. Based on a brief summary of support Harvard provides to graduate students, I infer that on average a graduate student receives about $60,000 per year in various forms of compensation and benefits including tuition remission, health insurance, and stipends. This is much higher than the U.S. median personal income of $28,155 per year. If two graduate students decided to form a household, then their combined compensation would place them in the top 15 percent household income bracket in the U.S.
True, graduate student stipends may not be enough to afford a comfortable lifestyle, or to cover essential dependent health care or childcare costs. However, the University provides financial support in various other forms, without which many students would not have been able to afford to attend the school in the first place or would graduate with a staggering amount of debt. It is also unclear whether the University should carry all the burdens that stem from the failures of the nation to provide affordable childcare, health care, and housing. Going to graduate school is not a necessity but a personal choice and students should bear the responsibility for their choices.
I have been particularly disquieted by a seemingly prevalent oversimplification in the organizing work of the HGSU-UAW. Many issues the organization hopes to address, such as timely payment and protection against discrimination and unreasonable workload, are complicated problems. Without any clear vision or plan based on objective research and well-reasoned arguments provided by the HGSU-UAW, any assertions that the union can help address these and  other  problems are just empty rhetoric, or undeliverable promises made in order to win support. Given that students if unionized will be paying 1.44 percent of gross income (at least $385, given the $26,800 stipend) as union dues, they deserve to know how the union will help them individually in detail.
I am under no illusion that the University does everything well. In particular, the leaders may not properly address educational problems graduate students face—such as a lack of adequate support for students’ professional development or sufficient mentoring necessary for timely graduation—because doing so often provides little concrete rewards. In theory, a graduate student union can resist such tendencies through the effective use of its collective bargaining power and economic weapons such as strike.
However, as a labor organization, a student union is always in danger of narrowly focusing on economic issues and making demands that cannot be easily met by the University. The administrators have an obligation to manage the University’s budget wisely by balancing a myriad of competing demands from various stakeholders while maintaining the organization’s financial health. It would be inappropriate for the administrators to concede to every demand of students, especially if they are based on questionable grounds.
Simply having a contract will not solve many problems graduate students face at Harvard. We need less rhetoric and more reasoned conversations based on research and data. I will continue to ask more questions about the HGSU-UAW, and I hope you will too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The row between Silicon Valley tech companies and Obama administration over access to encrypted content in personal devices has ended with the administration conceding its position: The government will not ask technology firms and smartphone manufacturers to install backdoors in smartphones and other digital devices that would allow law enforcement organizations and national security agencies access to personal data.
This decision comes as security experts warn that allowing the government privileged access to encrypted content using backdoors will weaken encryption technologies. Encryption technologies are most prominently used in smart phones, where they shield information like photographs, messages, and other potentially sensitive data. Security experts, who have compared the government’s demand to hiding “keys under doormats,” argue that a backdoor will make it easier for foreign hackers and cybercriminals to target such confidential content.
Ideally, government agencies would have access to encrypted content if it posed a threat to public safety. But allowing the government privileged access to digital devices would make the public more vulnerable by weakening the security mechanisms currently in place. The strong consensus among experts that a special backdoor would give rise to unacceptable risks is clear evidence that the current technology is not compatible with the Obama administration’s original demands. In short, the president was right to back down.
The demand for a privileged backdoor also raises questions about the relationship between tech companies and their users. As the companies themselves have argued, smartphones today contain an enormous amount of peoples’ most personal information. Smartphone manufacturers like Apple have started encrypting all content in their devices, assuring users that neither the company nor the government has improper access. Though public safety would be best served by allowing limited government access to smartphone data in narrow circumstances well defined by statute, the option under consideration by the Obama administration would also give companies broad access to users’ data—a possible breach of the consumer’s privacy.
Ultimately, the Obama administration’s plan failed to make a convincing case on security or privacy grounds. As the cyber-security community has shown, mandating backdoors would risk opening Americans to the same attacks by malicious nation-states and cybercriminals to which the government itself has fallen victim. And backdoors might also undermine the delicate and necessary trust between users and the tech companies that hold so much of their personal data. On all counts, then, the president’s decision was the correct one. Until the technology allows, the practice of leaving keys under doormats in cyberspace will only invite enterprising burglaries.

Kennedy School of Government lecturer Pippa Norris discussed various factors than can lead to failed elections in front of a small crowd gathered at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation on Tuesday afternoon.
Her talk was based off findings in her recently published book, Why Elections Fail. This is the second volume in a trilogy about the Electoral Integrity Project, a research project directed by Norris that aims to research and evaluate international elections, discover the causes and effects of election failure, and provide solutions for these failures.
Norris and her team have collected data on over 100 countries with a population of more than 100,000 that have held a national election between 2012 and now, and will continue to collect data in the coming year. The researchers have asked 40 experts in each country to fill out a survey with a range of questions about how the election was carried out, the results of which Norris has used to create a Perceptions of Electoral Integrity index. She defines electoral integrity as “international commitments and global norms, endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines.”
In this index, the United States ranks the worst of all established democracies, and below several other countries with shorter histories of electoral processes, including Rwanda and Tunisia, illustrating Norris’s point that election failure is not limited to the developing world.
“When we talk about problems of electoral integrity, in our project, we see them as universal,” Norris said.
According to Norris, one reason the U.S. ranks so low is that the success of elections has two dimensions—adherence to human rights and the administration of the elections themselves. The U.S. has scored low on the administration dimension, and on campaign finance issues in particular.
Norris is also interested in investigating other reasons that lead to low electoral integrity. Although she explores several different reasons in her book, she focused on the effects of the international community on elections in her talk.
She discussed her findings that the openness of a country’s borders and the electoral integrity of its neighbors have a large impact on the electoral integrity of the country itself. She has also found that the amount of aid spending in a country had no significant result on its electoral integrity score. Although she attributes this largely to the fact that aid is going to the worst cases, she said it poses a challenge for the final leg of her project, which is to propose solutions to election failure.
Attendee Paul Bernstein was drawn to the talk by concerns about American democracy and Norris’s work in the field.
“It’s a very worthy project,” Bernstein said. “It seems to be having good influence in places that are very needy, and it seems to mirror what we in America feel, that our democracy is not the best in the world.”

This is the second part in an occasional series on the College’s Program in General Education. Part I ran Sept. 29.
Faculty are hesitant to propose new courses for the College’s General Education program as it enters its final months of review, which could introduce substantial changes to Harvard’s core curriculum, deemed last semester by a faculty report “failing on a variety of fronts.” 
That report condemned the program for its lack of identity within the College, its shortage of financial support, and the fact that a large number of department courses could count for Gen Ed credit. And as the Gen Ed review committee prepares recommended solutions, expected by December, faculty are “waiting and watching” before proposing new courses, afraid that they might not fit into the revitalized program, said program director Stephanie H. Kenen.
“It’s an awkward time,” she said.
Perhaps because of this uncertainty, the program has seen a decrease in the number of course offerings this semester, Kenen said. She added, though, that there is usually fluctuation year to year in the number of Gen Ed courses offered.
Kenen said she has discouraged faculty from applying their departmental courses for Gen Ed recognition, since “it looks like those are going away.” The review committee’s report argued that most departmental courses that count for Gen Ed credit—accounting for roughly half of the program’s offerings—were not developed with the underlying principles of Gen Ed in mind.
Kenen and other administrators and professors in the program considered “putting a moratorium” on departmental courses in anticipation of the final recommendations, but ultimately decided to wait. The review committee will likely present the Faculty of Arts and Sciences with a finalized set of recommendations for the future of the Gen Ed program by the end of this semester.
Kenen, who has been involved with the program since it was first implemented, said administrators were relatively lax on what courses could count for Gen Ed because they needed to fill up the program quickly and did not have much money to do so.
“Then there were precedents set, and it was difficult to say no,” she said.
In recent years, though, Kenen said she has seen the quality of proposed Gen Ed courses improve. Faculty say the best courses fit with Gen Ed’s stated underlying goals, which include preparing students to act as citizens, respond to change, understand ethical consequences of their words and actions, and teach students to “understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and values.”
In general, professors across FAS have agreed with those goals, but take issue with the program’s implementation.

Patrick Ho, co-founder of Vaxess Technologies and a Harvard Law School graduate, spoke Tuesday about his experience in entrepreneurship and the challenges associated with building a for-profit company that supports the public interest.
The event, hosted by the Law School as part of its celebration of National Pro Bono Week, attracted more than 40 attendees, primarily law students.
Ho co-founded Vaxess Technologies during his third year with three other Harvard affiliates from across the university, with the goal of promoting global access to vaccines.
“Currently, all vaccines need to be refrigerated, and in many cases need to stay frozen in very stringent conditions,” Ho said. “Ideally, vaccines should be given to 7 billion people. And that’s pretty hard for areas that don’t have roads or electricity, let alone the ability to keep vaccines between two and eight degrees Celsius.”
Vaxess Technologies licenses a technology created by researchers at Tufts University, which uses a silk-derived protein to encapsulate and stabilize vaccines. This process allows vaccines to be transported more easily and without refrigeration.
In 2012, Ho and the other Vaxess co-founders were awarded $70,000 by winning the grand prize in Harvard’s President’s Challenge, organized by the Harvard Innovation Lab and University President Drew G. Faust, which challenged students to address societal problems via entrepreneurship. They also won $25,000 in Harvard Business School’s 2012 Business Plan Contest.
While Vaxess was initially a side project for Ho and his team, eventually they chose to focus on it after graduation, despite being offered jobs elsewhere.
“We felt this was an important human issue that we potentially had the technology to solve,” Ho said.
During the question-and-answer portion of the event, one law student inquired as to how Ho was able to make this a financially viable alternative to his standing job offers at the time.
“I didn’t,” Ho answered. “Frankly, it made no financial sense. We came out of the spring of our [third year] with about $150,000. That allowed for 12 months of running the company, including paying all of us. There was very little coming back into my pocket.”
“But at the end of the day, you have to invest in the upside,” Ho said. “It’s what we wanted to do, and I just hated the idea of seeing this project go on without me being a part of it.”
Lee B. Mestre, associate director of the Office of Clinical and Pro Bono Programs at the Law School, moderated the event.
“We’re happy to have Patrick here,” Mestre said. “We want to talk about doing well while doing good, and what it means to run a company that’s in the public interest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Given sufficient national will, political commitment, and adequate funding, humans could realistically be on Mars by 2030, said Charles F. Bolden, Jr., administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, at the Kennedy School of Government on Tuesday.
In contrast to the Apollo program, Bolden said, it will likely be a hybrid of commercial and public space, coupled with significant international collaboration and contribution, that will get us to the Mars. And once we get there, the possibilities of discovery and exploration could be extraordinarily transformative, he added.
“If we go to Mars and we are able to go to where the ice floes are and we find one living microbe in that ice floe, we have fundamentally changed everything that we know about life itself and about this universe—that’s what we’re chipping away at,” Bolden said. “Is it tiring? Yeah, it’s fatiguing sometimes. But it’s something that I think is so important to the future of humanity that we just have to stick in.”
Bolden’s remarks came as part of a panel discussion about space exploration and interstellar travel at the Institute of Politics, moderated by acting Kennedy School dean Archon Fung. Bolden, who is a retired Marine Corps major general, was joined by 100 Year Starship Project principal Mae C. Jemison, the first African American woman to travel in space.
Bolden and Jemison both highlighted the importance of public commitment to and enthusiasm for the future of the space program. Bolden also emphasized the critical partnerships between different nations and the public and private sectors moving forward, noting that NASA’s mandate under President Barack Obama was to phase out from the space shuttle program and depend on industry to provide transportation to low-earth orbit.
“A lot of people say, ‘Can’t we find an enemy that will propel us to do the kinds of things we did back in the 60s?’ and my response is ‘No—you don’t need one,’” Bolden said. “The enemy of the human psyche is the human psyche—you’ve got to be able to instill in your own self the will to do something greater than you really are.”
Jemison, for her part, said one challenge is reconciling the incremental approach and progress of space exploration and interstellar technologies with the short-term attitude of policymakers on Capitol Hill who might be concerned with more immediate payoffs than manned missions to Mars in 15 to 25 years.
“It’s not about the journey — the actual, physical journey—in many ways, space exploration…pushes us to do something more,” she added. “We believe pursuing an extraordinary tomorrow creates that better world today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 28, 2015, at 6:39 p.m.
As the plaintiffs of a lawsuit against Harvard continue to allege that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants, some students have questioned the College’s transparency on the issue, but a group of Asian and Asian American student leaders on campus are still not convinced of the plaintiffs’ claims.
The lawsuit, filed last November by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, accuses Harvard of enacting illegal quotas to limit the number of Asian American students admitted to the College. Edward Blum, the man organizing the lawsuit, previously advocated against race-based affirmative action in the high-profile 2013 case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin—now slated for a return to the U.S. Supreme Court this December.
The allegations have attracted a lot of attention from outside media outlets, and Harvard administrators have said that the lawsuit represents a threat to values of diversity they hold dear.
Several Asian American student leaders at Harvard, though, are skeptical of the plaintiffs’ logic. According to Alex J. Pong ’16, a Chinese American student who is a president of Harvard’s Asian American Association, the lawsuit represents another attack on affirmative action by Blum, “just using a different lens this time.” Blum declined to comment for this story.
“It’s very clear that this lawsuit has an agenda that’s not actually about helping Asian Americans and Asians,” Pong said.
Phebe J. Hong ’16, an Undergraduate Council representative who is Chinese American, agreed with Pong and argued that the fact that the lawsuit did not originate from within the Asian American community is troubling.
“The truth is, this lawsuit was neither initiated by Asian Americans, nor is it supported by a majority of Asian Americans,” Hong said.
Students for Fair Admissions does purport to represent a number of anonymous Asian American rejected and prospective applicants and their parents. The group recruited complainants last year through a site dubbed “Harvard Not Fair.”
Still, said Hong and other students, the plaintiffs cannot claim to speak for all Asian Americans.
“There is no singular ‘Asian American community’ that is dissatisfied with Harvard admissions,” said Kirin Gupta ’16, an intern at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations who is Indian American. Gupta argued that factors such as immigration and class differences make the term “Asian American” “a legally negligent characterization of many diverse communities.”
While the plaintiffs’ complaint advocates for race-neutral admissions because “it is lamentable for Harvard to lump all Asian Americans together in the admissions process,” Shaiba Rather ’17, a UC representative who is South Asian, took issue with the plaintiffs’ claim that Harvard considers its applicants as members of broad racial categories, not as individuals.
Jenny J. Choi ’16, a Crimson columnist who is Korean American, added that the discourse surrounding the lawsuit perpetuates the harmful perception of Asian Americans as “model minorities”—hardworking, compliant, and disproportionately successful.
Although several student leaders interviewed were highly critical of the lawsuit, some students have raised concerns about the transparency of Harvard’s admissions practices in light of the ongoing litigation.
In a Crimson op-ed earlier this year, undergraduate leaders of the Asian American Brotherhood—a social and service organization geared toward Asian American men—addressed the lawsuit, condemning the “use of an unofficial quota in university admissions” but acknowledging that it was still unclear whether Harvard in fact employs one.
“We don’t know exactly what is going on behind the closed doors of admissions offices,” the students wrote, calling on universities like Harvard to promote “greater transparency within their admissions process, and releasing the ethnographic statistics of their applicant pool.”
“We wish that Harvard were large enough to accommodate all who wish to study here,” they wrote. “Given that it isn’t, we should work to ensure that the available spots are accorded to those who most deserve them.”
Pong, for his part, also said he would not approve of the use of quotas, although he emphasized that he does not know if Harvard uses them.
“It’s really hard to judge what is going on here, but if there is a quota in place, it would really be problematic,” Pong said.
Still, on the whole, several student leaders seem to align with Harvard’s defense. Choi, Gupta, and other students criticized the plaintiffs’ argument that affirmative action policies have a “stigmatizing effect on the supposed beneficiaries of these policies”—namely, black and Latino applicants—who suffer from being “academically mismatched” to elite schools.
Much like Harvard officials have defended their affirmative action policies on the grounds that they are critical for diversity, Gupta and others defended the College’s use of affirmative action as necessary to creating a diverse campus and righting what Gupta called Harvard’s “legacies of deep complicity in systemic racial oppression.”

As their teams prepared to face off for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night, fans of the New York Mets and the Kansas City Royals gathered on campus and in bars around Harvard Square, excited and optimistic for the upcoming competition.
Anticipation for the Series is heightened this year because Major League Baseball’s 2015 postseason featured teams that have historically performed poorly in the playoffs, including eliminated division champions Chicago Cubs and Toronto Blue Jays.
“From the fan perspective, it’s good that baseball is finally no longer just three or four teams competing every year,” Royals fan Zack W. Royle ’17 said. “It used to just be the Yankees winning every year—baseball wasn’t interesting for other fans.”
Neither the Mets nor the Royals have won the World Series in several decades—the Mets last won in 1986 and the Royals in 1985.
“They’re perpetual underdogs,” Mets fan Oliver W. Kim ’16, a Crimson editorial writer, said of his favored team. “They’ve been pretty disappointing throughout their history, but they’ve had these moments of magic and electricity, which are just captivating.”
“I always say that this is the year for the Mets, but this time I was surprised that I was right,” said Daniel J. Kenny ’18, also a fan of the New York team. “After all the humiliation that the Mets and Mets fans have suffered over the past few years, this [is] extra satisfying.”
Royals fans, too, are excited, albeit surprised, about the team’s recent success.
“After experiencing so much ineptitude from the Royals in the beginning part of my life, my expectations are always pretty low,” Royals fan Max W. Sosland ’19 said. He said the team winning the World Series would “be a dream come true.”
Campus fans of the eliminated Cubs and Blue Jays, meanwhile, are disappointed by their losses, after following their teams closely. Blue Jays fan Dylan K. Wile ’19 said he watched every playoff game in his “reasonable grasp.”
Emma V.R. Noyes ’18 went home to Chicago to watch the final game of the Cubs’ playoff series earlier this month. She recalled the incredible disappointment that plagued fans after the team was swept by the Mets.
“By the end of the first inning, you could feel the energy drop,” said Noyes said, a Crimson magazine writer.
Ever optimistic, however, campus Cubs fans expressed confidence in their future prospects and pride in their team.
“It’s been 108 years now, but I think next year might be the one,” Cubs fan John S. Acton ’17. “If not next year, one of the next few.”

Speaking about gender-based online harassment, Sarah Jeong, a journalist and graduate of Harvard Law School, argued for a more “compassionate architecture of the internet” at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society on Tuesday afternoon.
Jeong used her “Theory of Garbage” to discuss the things, including harassment, that disable the internet as an avenue of communication for certain groups of people.
“The Theory of Garbage is very simple. The internet is mostly garbage,” Jeong said. “When I’m talking about garbage, I’m talking about things like spam. I’m talking about things like malware. And I want to include harassment...These things make the internet unusable.”
Jeong outlined the issue of “inequality in participation on the internet” with studies showing the disproportionate amount of abuse women receive online.
In her talk, Jeong cited a survey that revealed 60 percent of cyberstalking victims are women. Jeong also discussed a 2006 study at the University of Maryland in which researchers planted “silent bots” in an Internet Relay Chat with gendered usernames. According to Jeong, female-named “bots” received 25 times more “malicious messages” than their male counterparts.
Although many studies focus on online harassment directed at women, Jeong explained that the problem extends beyond lines of gender.
“It’s really important to know that this problem is exacerbated on every single axis of social oppression,” Jeong said.
Drawing upon her time at Harvard Law School, Jeong discussed the shift in discourse from a focus on free speech to a focus on safety.
“I came to HLS in a time when the frame was still very focused around, ‘Free speech is good. Oppressive government is bad. We must protect the internet from these threats of interference of censorship,’” Jeong said. “And suddenly, the discourse was changing. And you were increasingly seeing these examples of women getting physically threatened off of the internet.”
Jeong said the change in conversation regarding gendered online harassment created a discourse built around a dichotomy of “free speech versus women,” a distinction she found “upsetting.”
Using the Theory of Garbage as a framework, Jeong discussed cyberharassment from a policy standpoint, highlighting the role of social media developers.
“Changes to user interface are not neutral. They will hurt some people and help some people,” Jeong said. “Sometimes they’re very, very political.”
Especially prominent is the “unfortunate” focus on deletion in managing harassment on social media, according to Jeong.
“We think in these terms of deletion and it gets us nowhere, because deletion isn’t victory, it’s not liberation, it’s not freedom from fear. It’s just deletion,” she said.
A “more productive direction,” according to Jeong, is one that focuses on “compassionate user interface” and other ante hoc solutions, rather than “post hoc reactive measures” such as deletion.
“If we can just design the architecture of the internet in a compassionate, egalitarian way, we can get someplace,” Jeong said. “Garbage is a speech issue, but we still take out the garbage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In their last meeting with University President Drew G. Faust, Undergraduate Council leaders on Tuesday discussed campus social spaces and the results of the University-wide sexual conduct climate survey with Harvard’s top administrator.
The meeting struck a similar tone as the undergraduate student government leadership’s meeting in February: UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 approached the half-hour conversation with the intent of briefing Faust on the progress on their initiatives, rather than voicing demands.
“Different from past leadership meeting with President Faust, our meeting was more informational and less demanding,” Goyal said.
The duo has taken the same approach in their conversations with other top administrators. In a meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana earlier this semester, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal used the time to reflect on the year and brief him on Council initiatives. 
The current UC leadership’s approach to dealing with administrators strikes a stark contrast from last year. Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal’s predecessors, former UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, used their first meeting with Faust to request a $250,000 increase in student group funding, staging a rally outside her Massachusetts Hall office in the process.
The current UC leaders devoted a large part of their Tuesday meeting to discussing the recently released findings of the University-wide sexual conduct climate survey. Among other points, the survey found that more than 30 percent of senior women at the College surveyed reported being victims of some kind of sexual misconduct during their time at Harvard.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said the UC should have some role in starting more effective dialogue on campus regarding sexual conduct. Nasrollahzadeh proposed UC-hosted town halls to educate the student body about community-wide sexual conduct.
At the meeting, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal also proposed providing more shared social spaces for freshmen. According to the two students, Faust was receptive to the idea.
In their discussion about social spaces, the UC leaders did not speak with Faust about recent moves by some all-male final clubs to include women in their ranks, despite recent revelations that administrators have placed pressure on the groups to change.
In an interview after her meeting with Faust, Nasrollahzadeh said she saw the actions of the Fox and Spee Clubs as a “good initial step forward” for the College’s social scene. Nasrollahzadeh, a member of the all-female Bee Club, added that she welcomes other clubs to transition to co-ed membership as well.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal did update Faust on Omni, a smartphone application for undergraduates that contains informational features similar to the University-wide “Harvard” application. According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, the app has been downloaded more than 4,000 times, and about 60 percent of its users visit the app one to three times each day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Sanzone, a Cambridge City Council candidate, has decided to end his campaign following revelations this week that he had posted racist and homophobic comments on Stormfront.org, a white supremacy website, when he was a teenager. 
Following reports in The Cambridge Chronicle about his past online comments, Sanzone took to Facebook, making public his desire to withdraw himself not only from the election but also local politics more broadly.
“I am withdrawing completely from Cambridge public life, with a great deal of regret,” Sanzone wrote.
The online statements under scrutiny began in 2004, when Sanzone was a teenager and continued into his time at college, Sanzone told The Crimson in a statement.
Sanzone wrote in an email that his past comments have “no relationship whatsoever” with his current views. In a statement to The Chronicle, Sanzone, who is gay, described himself as closeted and “obviously in denial” when he took to the white supremacy website looking for “some sort of belonging.”
In the wake of the revelations, some fellow City Council candidates spoke out in support of Sanzone.
“It’s diametrically opposed to the way he is today,” said Jan Devereux, a City Council candidate. “I believe he’s trying to do good things for the city.”
Dennis Carlone, a current City Council member, likewise agreed that Sanzone had changed since the time of his online comments.
“I believe that, today, John is a mature, accepting person and not the person that we see in those words from his youth,” Carlone wrote in an email.
Members of the Slate for Cambridge, of which Sanzone was a member prior to the revelations, spoke out against Sanzone’s past comments, yet were supportive of his work in Cambridge.
“Slate for Cambridge candidates didn’t know of his past beliefs and condemn them in the strongest terms,” the group wrote in a joint statement. “We’re also encouraged by the empathetic public response from a city that has come to know John for who he is now—an active, inclusive community member working to make Cambridge a better place.”
While Sanzone has said that he no longer wishes to participate in Cambridge civic life, the ballots had been printed and Sanzone will still be listed as a candidate, according to Tanya L. Ford, the executive director of the Cambridge Election Commission.
Although he had never held an official position in Cambridge government, Sanzone was known as a strong advocate for local transit issues.
“Over the last few years, I made Cambridge my everything, and whatever I was in my younger days has nothing to do with who I am today. I’m sorry I was not a better person,” Sanzone wrote on Facebook.

In May 2017, more than 50 students will undergo Commencement exercises despite having spent only eight weeks of their two-year program in Boston. These students will represent the first class of graduates from the School of Public Health’s blended Master of Public Health in Epidemiology program.
Launched with its first cohort in June, the blended degree program combines on-campus and online courses: two three-week residencies in Boston in June 2015 and June 2016, online classes otherwise, and a final two-week residency in May 2017 to present a capstone project before program completion. 
The School of Public Health’s program joins several online MPH programs already offered by peer institutions. Johns Hopkins University first began its online MPH in 1999.
Currently in its first year of a three-year “test” period approved by Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, the program will undergo regular evaluations. Jenny Bergeron, director of educational research and assessment at the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, prepared a review of the program’s early stages for a special committee in the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning.
According to statistics released by Ian Lapp, the School of Public Health’s associate dean for strategic educational initiatives, the report found an average student satisfaction score of 4.9 out of five for the first three-week residency in Boston in June and 4.6 out of five for the first online courses completed by students.
Lapp, who said the ratings qualified the blended program as one of the most well-reviewed courses at the School of Public Health, added that the report also showed similar admissions rates, yield rates, and caliber of students interested in the blended program as compared to those interested in residential MPH programs. Although twice the length of a residential program, the blended degree costs a similar amount. The two-year blended MPH program costs $60,000 in tuition, compared to $56,000 for the one-year residential program.
According to administrators, students enrolled in the blended program represent a different kind of scholar than those the School of Public Health has drawn in the past. Every student in the program has already completed a doctoral or master’s level degree, and 60 percent are physicians.
MPH student Jaleel Durrani, a practicing anaesthesiologist from Louisville, Ky., stumbled across Harvard’s new program while Googling “online MPH degree.”
Though Durrani found the six to eight hours per week that he devotes to the program manageable, he said June’s three-week Boston residency proved more challenging, though “worth the effort.”
Durrani said the Massachusetts College of Art and Design dorms where the students stayed “could use some improvement,” but added that the residency prepared him “very well” for the online courses.
Samuel F. Stolpe, a pharmacist interested in health policy and another blended MPH student, said the residential program “was seamless from start to finish.”
An in-house team of course designers and videographers based at the School of Public Health’s Longwood campus, opting not to partner with HarvardX despite previous courses on the virtual education production, produce the online components of the blended degree.
According to epidemiology professor E. Francis Cook, undergoing course production in-house faced challenges.
“It’s a lot of work,” Cook  said. “Everyone is underestimating what it takes to put these things together, and we’re learning as we go along.”
Still, Cook said he is confident the program can overcome any initial trials in course design.
“I think we’re building what will be the best blended online on-campus MPH program that the world will have,” said Cook.
Both Cook and Lapp referred to discussions of potentially adding more blended programs at the School of Public Health if administrators deem the MPH in Epidemiology successful.
“Colleagues from other professional schools have shown significant interest in what we are doing,” Lapp said. “I’ll leave it at that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On football fields, on dorm-room floors, and in life, Dexter “D.J.” Monroe ’13 danced.
Sometimes, at the end of a Harvard football game, the former defensive back would carve out space in the locker room, find music, and bounce around the area, still wearing full pads.
Other times, on Saturday nights, he would take over a party by playing a favorite Southern rap song and commandeering part of the floor.
“He was a huge dancer,” said Nnamdi Obukwelu ’13, a former blockmate of Monroe’s and an ex-defensive tackle. “D.J. was the guy who was the life of a party.”
But Monroe, who died in a motorcycle accident on Oct. 13, was more than just a well-liked socialite. As teammates and friends reminisced, it was not the dancing so much as the underlying authenticity and self-confidence that marked Monroe as a special individual during his 24 years of life.
A leader on the Harvard football team, an irreplaceable member of a tight-knit friend group, and a proud brother in a family of three sisters, Monroe found people who loved him wherever he went.
This remains true even in death, as Monroe leaves behind a vast network of friends, teammates, and relatives who all seem to remember him in the same way: with a smile on his face.
“It’s always hard to picture D.J. without picturing the huge smile that he had,” said Adam Riegel ’13, another blockmate and former Harvard defensive tackle. “That smile and the laughter that always followed were two defining characteristics of who he was.”
The first time that defensive back Jonathan Mason ’12 saw that grin was nearly seven years ago, when Monroe visited Harvard for his official visit. Coming from Columbia, S.C., the prefrosh struck Mason as shy and tentative—maybe a little nervous about being so far from home.
In retrospect, that first impression makes Mason chuckle.
“When I re-met him as a freshman at Harvard, I learned how he really was,” Mason said. “He was the life of the party…. Once he felt comfortable, he kind of let loose, and that was the D.J. that we all knew and loved.”
This energy and charisma characterized Monroe throughout his time with Harvard, both on and off the field.
Donovan Celerin ’13, a blockmate and fellow defensive back, recalled one night during his freshman fall when he was caged in the basement of Grays Hall, studying class notes for a science course.
Noiselessly, Monroe snuck into the room, and before Celerin could react, the South Carolina native had shoved a pile of snow into his face, setting off a sprint through Harvard Yard that ended in snowballs and laughter.
“It’s something that I’ll never forget,” Celerin said. “That’s just the type of person that he was.”
But Monroe prioritized much more than friendly mischief during his time on campus. As a defensive back, he developed into a cornerstone of the Crimson secondary and earned two All-Ivy selections.
He played the same way that he lived: with pure joyfulness and intensity. As a senior, he defended 18 passes, more than any other college cornerback, and earned team-wide renown for his post-play celebrations, including his signature bow-and-arrow.
The stakes may have been lower on the practice field, but the same excitement remained. From the first day of freshman camp, teammates pegged Monroe as someone with a burning desire to succeed—and the natural talent to fulfill this desire.
For four years, defensive back and blockmate Brian Owusu ’13 was one of Monroe’s weightlifting partners. Although the trainer gave each player a personalized set of exercises to complete, Owusu and Monroe often went beyond those suggestions, adding weight in a quest for self-improvement.
“He had this enthusiasm about him and this demeanor that was always welcoming,” Owusu said. “At the same time, you could see the passion in his eyes about the game and wanting to do well.”
However, success did not come easily. In his sophomore year, Monroe blew out his ACL in a game at Lafayette, forcing him to miss the rest of the season and undergo several months of rehab.
Alongside him were Mason and Jaron Wilson ’14, two other secondary members who had suffered knee injuries. These three combined with a few others to form the New Knee Nation, or NKN for short, as they sought to push themselves through up to six extra hours of training a day.
Although he was a year younger than Mason, Monroe took on an authority role with the squad, pointing out lack of effort and motivating teammates to stick with the process. And despite suffering a second knee injury during the next preseason, Monroe returned at full strength to play in nine games in 2011.
According to various teammates, nothing during this trying process had much of an effect on Monroe’s personality. In particular, he maintained the same drive and authenticity that had distinguished him in the first place.
“He was the most genuine, kind-hearted person I’ve ever meant,” Wilson said. “He wanted to bring you into the fold.”
Of all Monroe’s Crimson friends and teammates, running back Treavor Scales ’13 was one of the first to experience these traits. A prospect out of Georgia, Scales happened to schedule his official visit at the same time as Monroe, and for the next four years, the pair remained together as members of a tight-knit football team and later an eight-person blocking group.
“We spent pretty much every waking moment together,” Scales said. “You had to have supreme confidence to even be in his presence…. It was beautiful to be around, and it made you just step out of your shell.”
The last time that Scales saw Monroe, the pair met up with Celerin in Florida. Monroe had made a roughly five-hour drive from Bristol to Tampa to be there with his friends.
“We sat out in the back of his truck, just chilling and reminiscing,” Scales said. “That’s most certainly one of the fondest memories I’ll ever have.”
In addition to his family of teammates, Monroe leaves behind a family of sisters and parents who have always played a seminal role in his life. Riegel estimated that Monroe called home four or five times a week when at school, and outside of those talks, Monroe rarely missed an opportunity to update his friends on the accomplishments of his three sisters.
While Monroe’s friends may never be able to fill the loss, they have pledged to provide any support that they can.
“We used to sing that Ten Thousand Men of Harvard song after every victory,” Wilson said. “[At the funeral], I looked at his mom, his dad, and his sisters, and I said, ‘I know that was your only brother—I know that was your only son. But because of your son, and because of who he was, you have ten thousand more sitting right beside you.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 28, 2015, at 5:41 a.m.
In a physical game at Jordan Field, a pair of seniors lifted the Harvard men’s soccer team (7-5-2, 3-1-0 Ivy) over crosstown rivals Boston College (8-6-1, 3-4-0 ACC) by a score of 2-1.
Classmates Michael Innocenzi and Oliver White came in from the sidelines and notched a goal each against the Eagles, ranked 14th in the RPI rankings. The match was the Crimson’s final nonconference contest as the team heads into the final stretch of the Ivy League season.
Half an hour into a cagey first period that saw the majority of play relegated to the middle third, the Harvard offense finally found its spark.
Some quick buildup play from senior forwards Jake Freeman and Tim Schmoll caught the Eagles off guard and led to a through ball that found its way through the BC back line. The ball ended up at the feet of Innocenzi, who poked a shot into the back of the net for his second goal of the season.
After a defensive struggle in the first stanza, the second half began with both teams displaying a much more attack-oriented mindset. With the searching long balls of the first period replaced by incisive short passes and aggressive physical play, momentum shifted back and forth.
It seemed as though neither team could find its footing for long enough to score, but White proved to be the Crimson’s sparkplug when he re-entered the game halfway through the second period. Just seconds after coming onto the field, the senior pounced on the ball after a scrum in the BC box to hammer it into the far side of the net.
“I was just on my toes, trying to drift towards the ball,” White said. “I knew I’d only have time for two touches; just take one to settle and another one to shoot.”
Harvard continued to press forward after going ahead but struggled to get off clean efforts on goal. Although the Crimson outshot the Eagles 11 to seven on the night, just four of the efforts were on frame.
“We’re going to work on our shots on goal,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “When we shoot on goal, we produce goals. The guys have worked on that and will continue to work on that and I think that’ll produce big dividends down the line.”
BC threw everything forward in the last 10 minutes of the match and was rewarded with a consolation goal as freshman Simon Enstrom nodded in a glancing header off of a hopeful cross from junior Zeiko Lewis with just over a minute left to play.
The lone score was not reflective of what was otherwise a strong performance by the Crimson back line. The Harvard defense limited a BC front line that has averaged 10.6 shots per game to just seven efforts on the night.
The defensive effort was led by co-captain netminder Evan Mendez, who totalled five saves on the night. As BC threw men forward after the Crimson’s second goal, the senior keeper was called upon to preserve his team’s lead.
Midway through the second period, the Eagles earned a throw deep in Harvard territory, and the ball found its way into the Crimson area from a long toss.
After a series of headers, and with Mendez out of position, a BC forward lobbed a shot at the unprotected Harvard frame. The Crimson keeper dove acrobatically to tip the ball just wide of the post.
“[Mendez] has been great, he’s been fantastic,” Lehrer said. “He’s been a great captain and a great leader, and he settles the back line, which is huge.”
Although the victory did not count for Ivy League standings, Harvard will appreciate the momentum going into the next game against Ancient Eight leader Dartmouth this Saturday.
“[The victory is] huge,” White said. “But at the same time, we look at every game the same. We want to win it, and that’s all that matters, playing our best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven minutes into the second half of the highly anticipated Harvard-Princeton football game, something strange caught my eye. Two balloons—one orange, one black—escaped from a child’s hands in the Princeton stands and drifted up, up, and away.
I looked down from the soaring balloons just in time to see senior Crimson quarterback Scott Hosch hit senior receiver Andrew Fischer on a fade route in the end zone. Touchdown, Harvard.
The drive was just the third of five consecutive series that would result in the Crimson (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) pulling away from a 7-7 deadlock with Princeton (4-2, 1-2) en route to a 42-7 thrashing of its most recent victim.
Take a number, Tigers coach Bob Surace, and get in line behind the other five Harvard opponents who may have thought they were solidly in play at some point in their matchups before halftime. Opponents which, a quarter or two later as the scoreboard became increasingly lopsided, would realize that day would not be a winning day—not against an offense that has yet to score fewer than 40 points in a game, and certainly not against a defense that allows an average of less than eight points per contest.
In a way, those balloons symbolized Princeton’s chances of leaving Allston with a victory. While the black and orange inflated bags of helium were securely in the child’s hand, it was indeed a ball game, and a downright riveting one for the crowd of 17,444 in Harvard Stadium, the highest attendance of the season.
This game had been touted by Harvard coach Tim Murphy and players all week as the first real test of the season, and the opening half did not disappoint in competitiveness—or in theatrics. The first quarter alone saw nine drives, four fumbles, and two forays each by Harvard and Princeton past the opposing team’s 40-yard line with no points to show for the effort.
Sure, Surace was probably upset that the Tigers’ excellent field position—two of Princeton’s possessions began in Harvard territory—didn’t yield any points, but the home team had its own problems too.
On the opening kickoff, rookie receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley caught the lateral from Fischer and returned it down to midfield before coughing up the Crimson’s first fumble of the game—and the season. Two Harvard drives later, on the cusp of field goal range, Murphy elected to attempt a fourth-down conversion that culminated in a sack.
The final Crimson drive before halftime ended in a touchdown, the result of a play so well designed that senior tight end Ben Braunecker, the eventual recipient of the scoring pass, slipped and fell into the end zone, and still managed to make the grab for the go-ahead score. Despite this, if I were Surace, I would probably have been pretty pleased going into halftime trailing by just seven—previous opponents had headed into the break down an average of 28.5 points.
Then, the Crimson offense found its third gear while the Harvard defense continued to show why it leads the FCS in scoring defense. Two Tigers three-and-outs later and two Harvard touchdowns later, it was 21-7, advantage home team.
For whatever reason—perhaps his hands had gone numb from hanging onto the balloons too long or perhaps he saw the futility in supporting a losing team—it was on the next Crimson drive that the child released the black and orange balloons. As Fischer hauled in another touchdown and the balloons soared away, so did Princeton’s chances.
In a lot of ways, 42-7 is misleading—it suggests a blowout, a steamrolling over a poorly matched opponent that my dad fondly refers to as a “cream puff.”
It would be unfair to term Princeton a cream puff, however. After all, this was a squad that did force four fumbles and recover two, Harvard’s first lost fumbles of the season.
But two turnovers do not a victory make against this Crimson team, and Surace found himself in a remarkably similar position in the fourth quarter to all the other coaches who have faced Murphy’s team this season: looking at a score indicative of a blowout, hopes of a comeback floating into the stratosphere.

Now that we are in the thick of fall, you might be growing tired of alternating between Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice lattes and Tealuxe's fall-flavored Spiced Chai, and are looking for a way to fulfill your foliage-colored dreams. A perfect way to do this is to go apple-picking. One place to go if you feel like collecting some apples from a place other than the dining hall is Honey Pot Hill Orchards.
The Orchard
Honey Pot Hill Orchards is located in Stow, Massachusetts, about 25 miles outside of Harvard. In addition to the rows upon rows of pickable apples, the orchard has a large hedge maze, a small animal farm, a stage for performances, and a gift shop to satisfy all of your apple product needs. Because we’ve all thought to ourselves at some point - how much better would life be if I could have five gallons of apple cider for the season?
How Do You Get to Stow?
One way to travel to the middle of nowhere (we mean, of course, Stow, Massachusetts) is by taking the T and a commuter rail. This trip took about an hour and 15 minutes to get to the orchard. On the way back, we were fortunate enough to find an Uber, casually passing by this rural spot. This made the ride back only about 45 to 50 minutes. Splitting the Uber fare could even potentially be cheaper than buying a train ticket.
