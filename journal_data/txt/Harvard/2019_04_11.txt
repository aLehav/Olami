After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my junior year, I found myself deeply jaded in a way I never expected to be at Harvard. The feeling crept up on me starting in the trainwreck that was my sophomore year season, inadequately termed “sophomore slump.” Yet, I didn’t know how entrenched it was with bitterness and anger until a specific, surprising instance happened junior fall. I was chilling with my best friend who was scrolling on Facebook, when she came across a post that elicited a reaction of utter disbelief. Some poor girl, who unbeknownst to her quickly became the target of our private ire, had posted a picture of a memorable moment with her smiling radiantly and in her caption had likened Harvard to “heaven on earth.” Our honest confusion at why anyone would consider Harvard to be heaven on earth morphed into annoyance and then finally anger as we discussed her post.
First of all, was she sure she was referring to Harvard College? She couldn’t have been describing the same college I had been attending for the past two and a half years. Second of all, how dare she have such a positive otherworldly experience here? At this point, I was relying on the grace of God to carry me throughout each and every day as I struggled to survive the year. The strength of my feelings of offense were so surprising that I had to ask myself how I had arrived at this state.
For all I knew this random girl could be lying and putting up a front for her friends and family like most people do on their social media — only showing their highlight reel. But witnessing her supposed joy in the midst of my despair forced me to take a serious look at my disillusionment with my Harvard experience and come to the conclusion that I had no one but myself to blame.
While there are most definitely external forces that contribute to the toxicity in our culture as well as real-life issues and inequities that affect our experiences, as students here, we must admit that sometimes our own hands build the very cages that trap us.
I chose my concentration. I chose the organizations that I participated in. I chose the people I surrounded myself with in my various social circles. Though I fully take responsibility for my actions, I had to further question why I did — and continue to do — things that inevitably put me in such a dark headspace that someone else’s happiness triggers a concoction of bitterness in me. It definitely took some mental and emotional work to interrogate my influences and deeply rooted impulses, but I was better for it.
I realized that under the influence of societal pressures I was forcing myself to live up to unrealistic internal expectations when outside factors will always affect the expected outcome of my decisions. I ignored warning signs (emotional and physical health concerns) and sometimes even advice from others, refusing to really learn from past experiences, with the belief that I could conquer and overcome even the most difficult situations. Though there is something to be said for experimentation as we go through college and the failures that may result from our decisions, continually choosing more than we can handle is as detrimental as it is unnecessarily “extra.”
I know I’m not alone in this either. I often joke around with my friends about how they are gluttons for punishment when they decide to take an additional class that is notoriously hard or once again involve themselves in multiple extracurricular activities knowing they have trouble balancing their commitments. Why are we almost compelled to be extra? The serious truth is that many of us take the path of most resistance just to say that we did. Because if we didn’t struggle, did we really earn it? Regardless of how hard we worked to get here and instead of just accepting the blessing of admission, we somehow now feel that we have to prove that our Harvard degrees didn’t just fall into our laps.
The irony is that real struggle — that we never planned for — will come: No life journey is without its challenges, even when we are doing everything right. So instead of inventing issues, maybe we should give ourselves a little grace when possible, fortifying ourselves for those inevitable moments of hardship. This simply means avoiding the unnecessary stress that come with overloading on obligations when our mental, physical, and emotional energy — not to mention time — is limited.
What would our Harvard experience be like without the extra? If we studied something we really loved? If we always took four classes? If we did one extracurricular activity we actually cared about? If we only became friends with people we genuinely have a connection with? Maybe we would actually fully enjoy our time here rather than fondly remember a few highs engulfed in a vastness of lows. To me, that version of Harvard sounds like heaven on earth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Part of the challenge is just trying to be morally consistent — to have some sense of integrity, and to fundamentally acknowledge the way in which a precious Palestinian baby has exactly the same value as a precious Jewish baby.” African American Studies professor Cornel West’s words reverberated across a packed auditorium last week. While his words seem commonsensical, the reality is that the basic humanity of Palestinians is denied every day.
In Gaza, one of the most densely populated places on Earth, 1.9 million Palestinians — almost three-quarters of whom are refugees — are locked in an open-air prison, unable to leave the strip. Many of these refugees still have keys to their homes inside present-day Israel. However, to this day, Israel’s laws forbid them from returning, ever since 750,000 Palestinians were exiled in 1948. Repeated Israeli aerial bombings have killed thousands of innocent people and attacked schools, hospitals, and homes. In 2018 alone, Israeli Defense Forces killed almost 200 Palestinians peacefully protesting to demand their right of return. A recent UN report called this massacre a potential war crime.
In Israel, there are 66 laws that discriminate against Palestinians, reducing them to second-class citizenship. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently stated that “Israel is not a state of all its citizens” and that “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people – and only it.”
In the West Bank, occupied by Israel in 1967, over 600,000 Israeli settlers live in illegal Jewish-only settlements. Hundreds of Israeli military checkpoints impede the mobility of the Palestinians living there. While Israelis living in settlements, illegal under international law, are governed by Israeli civil law, Palestinians as young as 12 are tried in Israeli military courts, which have a conviction rate of more than 99.7 percent for Palestinians. Two sets of laws for two peoples living on the same land.
Apartheid, as defined by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, consists of inhumane acts committed in an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination by one racial group over another, with the intention of maintaining that regime. Israeli policy makes clear that Israel fulfills the conditions of the crime of apartheid as defined by the ICC. Israel is an apartheid state, and we must recognize it as such. It is only by recognizing this fact of the situation that we can productively move forward.
Through Israeli Apartheid Week, the Palestine Solidarity Committee aims to raise the suppressed voice of Palestinians, share their pain, and connect it to other struggles against injustice. This is why we stand with Act on a Dream, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, the Student Labor Action Movement, and many others fighting injustice. This solidarity was beautifully exemplified by the Wall of Resistance, which we proudly displayed alongside 14 other organizations.
This is also why we stand unwaveringly in solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters in the face of anti-Semitism. We condemn anti-Semitism with the same conviction and moral clarity with which we condemn Israeli oppression. If it were our Jewish brothers and sisters oppressed by Palestinians, we would be the first to hold a Palestinian Apartheid Week. This conviction was exemplified at our Black-Palestinian Solidarity panel. When an individual unaffiliated with the PSC made anti-Semitic statements during the Q&A session, he was immediately shut down by the panelists, PSC organizers, and the audience. The room refused to tolerate anti-Semitism with the same vigor with which it engaged the content of the panel. Our vision for a more just world, just as it includes safety and security for our Jewish peers, must also include justice and freedom for all Palestinians.
This moral imperative, however, means that fighting for Palestinian freedom should not be any more controversial than fighting racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination. All that Palestinians are asking for is to have the same rights that all people should have — simply to be treated as human beings. This cannot be treated as ‘controversial’ any longer. Equal access to water should not be controversial. Safety from snipers during peaceful protests should not be controversial. The humanity of Palestinians should not be controversial. Everyone who believes in human rights should stand with the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation.
The time for silence is over. Systematic defamation, intimidation, and suppression of Palestinian voices have created a climate in which silence is the default. Even PSC members fear putting their names on articles like this. We fear blacklisting by anonymously-run websites like Canary Mission, which can stand in the way of our careers and graduate school plans, and pose an extreme risk for students with homes and families in Palestine or Israel.
Perhaps the most heartbreaking example we have seen was when one Palestinian student backed out from speaking at a panel discussion during IAW, fearing the threat their statements could pose to themselves and their loved ones. Instead, they submitted somber words describing how in their time outside of Palestine, they have realized that much of what to them had seemed normal as a Palestinian — tear gas, the sound of military aircrafts, being held at gunpoint, and countless other staples of life under occupation — is, in fact, not normal. Even as a Harvard student in the 21st century, we saw firsthand how their freedom of expression and freedom of movement remain so vulnerable and easy to lose. We saw and heard how they felt suffocated, as they sat in silence while others read their story — at the very event, moreover, meant to amplify their voice and others like it.
Our silence will not protect families that have suffered under military occupation for three generations. As we speak out against mass incarceration or mass deportation, we also face a moral imperative to raise our voices for equal rights for Palestinian people.
Will Harvard once again fail to be on the right side of history, as it did with South African apartheid? Or will it be the force of change it has tremendous potential to be? We have been heartened by the support we received during Israeli Apartheid Week, and have hope that Harvard will choose change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria in a recent interview spoke to the growing mistrust in capitalism, particularly among young people. His comments addressed the Business School’s role in restoring that confidence and working to support developments in the curriculum like the popular course, “Reimagining Capitalism.” Nohria went on to highlight other areas of change, such as directing more research to issues affecting economically-marginalized communities and improving delivery of social and public goods like healthcare and education. The interview also touched on ongoing efforts at the Business School to foster better racial and gender diversity at the school.
As the leader of a premier global institution of capitalism, Nohria’s comments underscore the extent to which capitalism as a totalizing economic system is facing a crisis of political sustainability. Far-right movements in the U.S. and around the world, worsening inequality, and rampant economic exploitation — not to mention a sense that young Americans are getting the short end of the stick — only serve to underline this trend. As dean of the Business School, Nohria is in a unique position to set a vision and agenda for the school that seek to consciously and systematically reform capitalism and educate its newest leaders to combat these systemic issues.
We are fully cognizant of the conflicts and difficulties inherent in this kind of deliberate self-transformation — especially for an institution like the Business School, whose existence is tied so inextricably to the perpetuation of often-pernicious market forces and the empowerment of a moneyed upper class. In particular, Nohria’s statements that focused on restoring society’s trust in capitalism seemed to suggest that the primary problem with capitalism is its image.
We disagree with that assessment. A broader view of the challenges to the modern economic system demands a more systemic rethink of the Business School’s role in the business community and the economic system it champions more broadly.
That rethink requires change far beyond the work already being done at the school, not least in terms of directing research dollars and devising a new curriculum. Efforts at improving diversity and inclusion at the school, though admirable, do not go nearly far enough in laying out a way forward. Rather, the Business School can and should reorient itself to searching for systemic reforms and researching them to address the above matters.
Whether or not Nohria expands on the spirit of his comments to grapple with the enormity of the problem facing capitalism, we as a Board feel it is important to emphasize the opportunity that stands before him and the Business School.
We are at a moment in history marked by political instability and dissatisfaction with capitalism, as Nohria acknowledges. If the school wishes to stay relevant, it seems to have two choices. It can seek to perpetuate capitalism in its current form and benefit from its position as an important educational center in that system, accepting the inequalities that go with that choice. Or it can stake a claim to leading a vital new project, reimagining the shape and role of capitalism in our society and world.

When I first started watching Korean dramas, I was too young to be cynical.
I used to watch them with my grandmother on our couch. My Korean vocabulary was limited, so I couldn’t understand everything the characters were saying. But the plot points were familiar enough that I could follow along: poor virtuous girl falls in love with rich man, evil mother-in-law tries to thwart their marriage, cancer or a car accident yields a tearful resolution.
My grandmother always seemed to be doing something — washing the dishes, knitting, chopping vegetables. But when the dramas were on, she would wrap her arms around me and be still. We gasped and cried and yelled at the screen. When episodes ended on cliffhangers — the images on the screen freezing, their colors turning into pastels, a love ballad beginning to play — we shouldered the unbearable burden of waiting for the next episode together.
***
Last summer, I spent two months studying abroad in Seoul. After my grandmother passed away five years ago, I stopped speaking Korean, stopped watching dramas, and my tongue became less and less comfortable with the language until I could barely speak it at all.
While I was in Seoul, some of my Korean came back to me by necessity — I had to speak it, or no coffee, no taxi ride. I was not fluent, but I thought that I was at least becoming decent.
At the end of the study abroad program, my mother met me in Seoul so that we could visit extended family. I thought that maybe we could speak Korean with each other. But there were too many corners of the language that I could not navigate, intimate crevices that I only could have known had I grown up and gone to school in Korea. After a few tries, my mother and I both slipped back into English.
***
These days, I like to make fun of Korean dramas: the sentimentality, the overwrought soundtracks, the predictable tropes. They are perfect for Facebook memes, drinking games, and laughing at with friends.
Sometimes, though, I carefully surrender this shield of cynicism. Alone in my room, I inhale Korean dramas in quick gasps, furtively, like I’m afraid someone will walk in on me. They are my way into spaces that I will never be a part of — Korean cafés, schools, families. I watch as characters switch easily between speech levels and honorifics that I will never have to use, that I will never get the chance to use.
When I encounter an unfamiliar grammar pattern, I pause the drama and try to repeat the phrasing out loud. It feels like putting a huge gumball into my mouth, so big I can barely crack the edges and soften it to be chewable. I work and work my jaws until the phrase fits comfortably on my tongue. I spit it out and it joins a collection that I’m too embarrassed to show anyone else.
***
During one of my Korean language classes last summer, my teacher showed us a massive chart of Korean vocabulary words for family members. Where one English word suffices for a certain familial relation, two or three or more Korean words are needed, depending on if the person is older or younger than you, married or unmarried, related to you on your mother’s or father’s side.
My classmates and I gaped at the chart. How were we supposed to learn all of those words?
Don’t worry, our teacher said. You don’t need to memorize them. You’ll never need to use them. Even Korean people have to study what to call their new family members before they get married.
I wondered about the other vocabulary we had to memorize. Method. Receipt. City Hall. What is the best method for storing old books? Would you like your receipt with that? Which subway stop should I get off at to find City Hall? Why was I memorizing these words when I would never be in these situations?
Despite my reservations, I continued taking Korean when I returned to Harvard. But as I read theory and wrote papers and built friendships all in English, the futility of memorizing basic Korean vocabulary and grammar became harder to ignore.
I will never have the same grasp of Korean that I do of English. I will probably never return to Seoul for as long as I was there last summer. The time I spent speaking Korean with my grandmother becomes a smaller fraction of my life with each passing year. I am only half Korean and my children will probably be one quarter Korean, and my mother will tell them bedtime stories in English, and sing them lullabies in English, and we will love each other in English.
Why do I study Korean?
To turn on a Korean drama and just listen. To stop struggling and yearning for something more. To let the familiar sounds wash over me and let the unfamiliar sounds go. To be still, to be held.

On the 2020 campaign trail and in his hometown of South Bend, Ind., Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 is best known as Mayor Pete. Just fifteen years ago, he was the student president of Harvard’s Institute of Politics; soon, he will officially launch his campaign to become the president of the United States.
Though he was initially considered a long-shot, the 37-year-old mayor appears to be gaining traction. As of April 1, Buttigieg was the second-most Googled prospective Democratic presidential candidate, and a recent Iowa caucus poll revealed him to be narrowly in third place among Democratic primary contenders (although the survey’s margin of error was 6.2%).
FM sat down with Mayor Pete in a second-floor office at the Institute of Politics, an old haunt from his time as IOP president. We talked about his college days, “The West Wing,” and his Supreme Court-packing proposal. Today’s IOP student leaders have placed a poster behind him for the occasion that reads: “Mayors ask what youth can do.” 
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: What’s it like being back at the IOP, where you served as president?
PB:  This place shaped me, so much so that my parents would kind of wryly ask whether I was attending Harvard College or whether I was attending the IOP. There were many very exciting moments here. I remember Ted Sorensen was here and wished me luck as I went to give my speech campaigning to be the student president, and said something kind, and it felt like a benediction from the Kennedy era. Just being surrounded by that kind of history was really exciting. But more than anything it was just being around people who cared about the country, cared about politics.
FM: The Crimson reported back in the early 2000s that you used to organize watch parties of “The West Wing”. I saw that you met Bradley Whitford recently — and I think Richard Schiff also tweeted his support for your campaign. How did that show influence your political upbringing?
PB: I think “The West Wing” created a certain view of what we hope the White House would be like, in terms of the intellect and in terms of the intentions of the people who are there. And I think one reason now people are returning to it a little bit is it’s kind of an antidote, if only by escapism, to the moment that we’re living in. So of course as somebody who grew up on that stuff, it’s pretty moving — and a bit unreal — to find now that I’m being talked about so kindly by some of the people who helped shape those stories to begin with.
FM: To go back to your time at Harvard, why did you decide to study History and Literature, as opposed to, say, Government?
PB: I did History and Literature because I cared about literature a lot, and I realized almost anything else I wanted to study, I could study it through the guise of history. So if I wanted to do politics, I could do Ernest May’s course on the Cold War. And it really allowed me to broaden my range of understanding how the world works, without being too hemmed in to any one discipline. In the end, it was probably mostly the literature classes that made the deepest impressions. And then, the funny thing about studying Arabic was that my freshman fall, the fall of 2000, it was a pretty exotic thing to do. Of course a year later, Arabic studies here kind of blew up, because I think many more people sensed the importance of it.
FM: You’ve talked about how it took years for you to come out as a gay man. When you were a student here, what was the environment like for LGBTQ students?
PB: As a student here, to be honest, I wasn’t even out to myself. It took a long time for me. I would say that this was a place that broadly wanted to be accepting, but still had a long way to go. And at the same time, you know, if my home in Indiana were as accepting as Harvard, I probably would’ve been able to get here [sooner].
FM: While you were a student, where were your favorite spots on campus?
PB: I spent a lot of time in this room, in this student office, which was actually a little grubbier in my day. There’s the Farnsworth room in Lamont, a very important place. I hope that’s about the same. And any place you can see Memorial Church. Something about that just sort of perfect architectural form, it always kind of centered me, even though I didn’t go there very much.
FM: You’ve said that the right has a monopoly on religion in politics. And you’ve cited Mike Pence as an example of that. On Harvard’s largely secular campus, what was your faith like during college?
PB: I took a class with Peter Gomes, and he was a very influential figure here on campus, and somebody I really admired. I think it was, having come up with a certain — somewhat different version of religion than I was exposed to in Catholic high school education, I began to understand just how much range there was in the kind of social teachings of Christianity. But I didn’t have much of a religious life until I got to grad school.
FM: You wrote in your book that the monuments in Memorial Church and Memorial Hall influenced your decision to join the military. What are your thoughts on being one of the relatively few students to do so?
PB: At the IOP, I was soaked in the Kennedy legend, the idea that part of life is public service and that for many, that means military service as well. I don’t mean to say that you have to serve in the military to be a good political figure or public servant, but I think it was here that I began to imbibe that idea that especially when you have a privileged education, that you have an outsized responsibility to make yourself useful, even if that means taking risks. And so I think I carried that ethic with me, but it took me a while to make good on it. And I’m glad in the end that I did.
FM: Before you joined the military, you worked for McKinsey. I know that a couple of reporters from The New Yorker and New York Magazine have asked you about your opinions on McKinsey’s role in opioid sales and identifying Saudi Arabian dissidents. What consequences do you think McKinsey ought to face for its role in those scandals?
PB: Well, I think they need to do a reckoning, first of all, on what kind of clients they’re going to be serving. Some of these questions are legal ones, and I don’t understand the cases well enough, but what I do know is that a firm that wants to be as prestigious as McKinsey needs to also have the absolute highest standards on who it decides who to do business with. And bigger’s not always better.
FM: You’ve suggested that you’d be open to the idea of statutorily expanding the Supreme Court to 15 justices. Are you concerned that this would open the door to some instability?
PB: Well, it would have to be well thought-through and thoroughly debated. But what interests me is a change that would diminish the likelihood of the Supreme Court being viewed as a political body. And if we get it right, it should be something that would stand the test of time, and that there would be a bipartisan consensus around doing. It’s not about believing that the Supreme Court’s too conservative — even though I do believe that it’s more conservative than the American people. This is about the court getting politicized, and I think there should be a robust American majority around the idea of not allowing it to remain politicized.
FM: In your memoir, you contrast your college days in Cambridge with your childhood in South Bend. Having lived in both the Midwest and the Northeast, what common ground do you see between Indiana and Massachusetts voters?
PB: Well, one thing is that no state should be painted with a broad brush. There are communities like Springfield, Longmeadow, Fall River, that would probably have more in common with South Bend than they might with Cambridge. It’s important at the outset to recognize how varied each of our states can be. I think another commonality is that our communities are looking for answers that don’t depend on turning back the clock. We need to figure out how to be true to the most compelling and appealing parts of our tradition without being trapped by them. And I think that’s one of the questions at stake as we try to figure out how to have a more robust account of mastering the changes coming in our future, [rather] than just [making] impossible promises to rewind to the past and make America great again.

On a stage at the Harvard Education Portal, Koji A. Everard ’20 sits before a potter’s wheel, patiently crafting a small vase from a lump of clay. A cellist plays beside him.
As the performance reaches its conclusion, Everard reaches beneath the vase with a wire, and in one fluid motion, he splits it cleanly in half. The audience’s rapt attention disintegrates into chaos as he gleefully holds up the remains of the destroyed vase.
That was a year ago, at the opening reception of the 10th annual Harvard Student Art Show. Now, Everard works in a rural pottery workshop in central Japan. He still creates pottery — and he still destroys it.
A lot of it.
Everard has spent the last year as an apprentice to the master potter Taki Nakazato, whose family has been working with pottery in the city of Karatsu for fifteen generations. Nakazato and his family produce handmade ceramics for distribution across the world. They specialize in tableware that is both artistic and practical.
“Their technical excellence and skill levels are really unprecedented,” says Everard in a phone call.
Striving to meet Nakazato’s — and his own — high standards, Everard made more than 5,000 plates during his first six months of apprenticeship. Most were destroyed before they reached the kiln, and their clay was recycled for later use. Every piece that enters the kiln must be perfect.
Since beginning his apprenticeship with Nakazato, Everard’s technical skill has grown substantially. “What I thought was my best work, what I believed I loved a year ago, has changed,” he says. “I look back on the things that I used to think were my best work … and I inevitably find flaws where it's lacking in some way or another. ”
Everard’s introduction to pottery began with his grandfather’s East Asian pottery collection. Though he never paid much attention to the collection while living with his grandfather in Tokyo during elementary school, he says that being around it kindled a “subconscious interest” in pottery.
He began to pursue this interest in high school, when he enrolled in an introductory arts course that largely focused on using a potter’s wheel. Even though he only took that first course to fulfill a graduation requirement, he enjoyed it so much that he continued with successive courses each year. Eventually, he pursued an independent study project in pottery.
“I find that when everything's clicking, and I'm on the wheel, and I'm really producing work more efficiently than I could before or smoother than before, that feeling is really sublime,” Everard says. “It's about how it makes me feel. It's not really about what I produce.”
Before he came to Harvard, Everard’s mother suggested he take a gap year to learn how to make Japanese pottery. He researched six prominent kilns in central Japan, each with a history reaching back to the 12th century. He wrote letters to the regional pottery guilds that oversaw the kilns, relying on his grandfather to vouch for his talent. He ultimately drew the attention of a few guilds and travelled to Japan to visit them.
Shortly after graduating from high school, Everard began to work with a potter in the city of Tamba, Japan.
“For me, it wasn't really like an apprentice-teacher relationship,” he says. “I was there to just learn. I wasn't being paid. I was more his friend than anything.”
After two years at Harvard, Everard decided to return to Japan to work under Nakazato. But he quickly realized that this apprenticeship would be nothing like his gap year in Tamba.
Now, training alongside another apprentice, Everard follows the strict curriculum of the Nakazato family. He begins a typical day at 7:45 a.m., preparing and cleaning the studio. Throughout the rest of the day, his jobs include glazing, cutting grass, procuring and processing clay, and chopping wood for the kilns — by his count, 12 tons of wood so far.
“Sometimes, I think it’s work a non-sentient being could do. Just hire a monkey, honestly,” he jokes. “But it is rewarding in a very different way. It's very different from doing a p-set or turning in a paper. You really see the result of your labor before your eyes.”
Everard finds creative ways to differentiate himself from a hired monkey. While cutting wood for five hours straight several days ago, he says he ruminated on the opening line of Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.”
At 5:30 p.m., Everard finally sits down at the potter’s wheel. Before his apprenticeship with Nakazato, he enjoyed creating tall, elaborate vases. In the first six months of his apprenticeship, however, he spent every day making plates. By the end of the six months, he was allowed to fire only 90 of those plates in the Nakazato kiln.
Through his apprenticeship, Everard has also internalized Nakazato’s “waste not, want not” philosophy.
“I broke a brush once because I just handled it too strongly — but the brush was 10 years old, it was going to break anyway,” he says. “And then I told the other apprentice, ‘Hey, this brush broke. Can we just buy a new one?’ And he's like, ‘No, we’ve got to fix that before the sensei notices or we’ll get in trouble.’ Okay, shit, how do you fix this?”
This philosophy also extends to Everard’s recycling of clay. Because the Nakazato family makes all of its clay from scratch, every ounce is valuable. “Most studios in the U.S. … you buy your own clay, but here we don't buy clay. We have a huge amount stockpiled that we've gathered over the years,” he says. “We literally take rocks that we dug, and we process that into clay, which requires several different machines and a lot of labor.”
Everard will carry these philosophies back with him when he returns to Harvard in the fall. He plans to continue his involvement in the Ceramics Program at the Office for the Arts, but he is unsure of where pottery will take him after he graduates.
“I'd like to do it my entire life,” he says. “It's something you can do at any age, as long as you can move your hands, basically. There's no real age limit to it, which is really something that's beautiful about it.”
“I feel very fortunate that I found something that gives me so much joy at this young of an age.”

The floor around a stepladder in Ticknor Lounge is strewn with marshmallows and chunks of apple. Several blowtorches grace a table like so many vases. A pogo stick leans against an upholstered bench, in front of which stands another table holding a milk bottle full of water, a bowl of apples that have escaped the fate of their sliced peers, and a samurai sword.
This debris is left over from a presentation by Ashrita Furman, the man who holds the world record for breaking Guinness world records. He has set more than 700 official records and currently holds over 200. During his presentation on April 3 in Harvard’s Boylston Hall, Furman began by introducing his philosophy, which centers around the search for happiness and the practice of meditation.
No sooner had he finished this preamble than he began to skip across the stage. Mid-hop, Furman explained to the crowd that he believes skipping expresses the kind of childish fun we begin to lose with age. He proceeded to recount that he once skipped an entire marathon.
Furman’s talk combined his personal idiosyncrasies with more conventional forms of spiritualism. For instance, after putting out six blowtorches with his mouth (“you can hear the sizzle of your tongue every time it hits the metal”) and briefly noting the times he pogo-sticked underwater, in Antarctica, and up Toronto’s CN tower, he led the audience through a series of chanting, concentration, and visualization exercises. After balancing a step-ladder on his chin, still out of breath, he began coaching techniques to quiet the mind. Upon his request, the crowd chanted an eerily drawn-out rendition of the syllables “gra-ti-tude,” while passersby looked in quizzically though the tall windows of Ticknor lounge.
Some of Furman’s corporeal feats verged on the culinary. At one point, he invited up a friend, the mononymic “Bipin,” who proceeded to launch marshmallows, with astounding aim, towards Furman’s mouth. A few rounds in, Furman spit out a marshmallow to observe, “I’m missing a lot of them,” but quickly picked up the slack. Furman also recounted his journey with samurai practice, which he took up in an attempt to break the record of most apples samurai-sword-sliced in under a minute. This story, of course, did not pass unaccompanied by a duly gripping demonstration.
***
Furman lives for breaking the records of a book that was conceived just a few days before he was born. The idea for Guinness World Records appeared in the early 1950s as a promotional scheme for Guinness Brewery. According to the Guinness World Records’ official website, Sir Hugh Beaver, the brewery’s managing director at the time, once got into an argument about the fastest game bird in Europe, and, finding no satisfactory answer, became convinced of the necessity of compiling a book of facts to settle disputes in pubs.
In his youth, Furman became obsessed with what had become the beer company’s compilation of bizarre competitive feats. At 16, Furman met a meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy, in his hometown of Queens, New York, who emphasized physical excellence as a means of transcendence. Since then, Furman has applied Chinmoy’s mind-over-body doctrine and emphasis on athleticism to achieve record-breaking feats.
As he cleaned up the remnants of his presentation, Furman spoke to Fifteen Minutes about all things superlative and spiritual. When asked which of his broken records he felt the strongest about, he recapped a story he had told during the event. “I was going to do forward rolls along Paul Revere's ride, which is 12 and a quarter miles.” When breaking a Guinness record, he explained, the activity must be continuous, with one exception: “You're allowed to stop to throw up — it's the only time you're allowed to stop.” Furman admitted that he succumbed to this exemption many times on the forward-roll ride; somewhere along the way, he decided he would stop at the 10-mile point, just enough to break the existing record.
“People magazine was following me, it was being broadcast on the radio, and a furniture store along the route heard about me... They put out this big La-Z-Boy chair right in front of the store, which was just past... the 10 mile point,” he remembers. “It was like seeing an oasis in the desert.” But when he approached the chair, a friend who was with him phoned Sri Chinmoy, who instructed him to urge Furman to finish. After a split-second in the La-Z-Boy, Furman obeyed — he got back up and found himself speaking a chant he had never heard before. “I am not the body, I am the soul,” he repeated, and he went on to finish the entire route.
Despite the record book’s emphasis on quantification and publication, Furman maintains that his motivations are not material. “I mean, I don't care about, you know, getting in the book. It's all about having these experiences of transcending your limitations — like, really pushing past where you think is possible.” That the mantra came to Furman after his 10.5-hour forward roll foray perfectly elucidates this mind-over-body philosophy.
But Furman’s insistence that he does not care about entering the annals of the beer company’s fact almanac renders his methodology mystifying: The way he transcends his own limitations is specifically by surpassing the limits of others as catalogued in the book. Yet, in doing so, he seems to have found an enviable happiness.
***
The prospect of an unconventional path to happiness attracted audience members to Furman’s Boylston event. Tony Shu ’21, sitting in the second row, initially wanted to take an academic approach. He lotteried Harvard’s popular philosophy course Phil 20: “Happiness.”
“The ironic part about that is I did not get the lottery — so I was very unhappy because of it,” he recalled.
Prior to the event, Shu hoped to hear more about Furman’s “quirky approach to getting towards happiness.”
Shu also seemed to feel a personal affinity for the presenter’s mode of achievement, reminiscing on his own attempts at “Guinnessport” (the technical term for the undertaking of challenges with the express purpose of breaking a world record). Over a dull middle school summer, Shu decided that he was “going to try to find the easiest world record to break.” He discovered the perfect challenge: “longest paperclip chain made in 30 seconds.” After weeks of practice and one fraught disqualification (he had stepped out of frame in his video and was consequently deprived of his title by a vigilant whistle-blower), he succeeded in surpassing all other speedy paper clip connectors. A certificate from Guinness detailing his achievement still hangs on his bedroom wall.
On the surface, one might align the achievement-seeking culture of Harvard students with Furman’s own desire to surpass predetermined marks of excellence. Did Shu’s paper clip connecting foreshadow his future academic ambitions? Perhaps, but what distinguishes a Harvard acceptance from a Guinness certificate is its practical significance: No employer looks for Guinness records on a resume. So maybe Furman’s pursuit of those particular marks of achievement truly does transcend the framework of social status and accepted forms of ambition. He has circumvented these tenets of adulthood in channeling his remarkable abilities not toward an athletic scholarship or Olympic medal, but towards the sort of goals Shu embraced as a child. Hence his belief in the childish joy of skipping.
Furman was brought to Harvard by “The Giving Pledge,” a recently formed organization which helps students pledge a percentage of their post-grad salary to demonstrably effective charities of their choice. After Furman’s presentation, FM spoke to the project’s co-founders, Jadyn K. Broomfield ’21 and Andrew D. Zuckerman ’21, in the hopes of finding out what about their mission motivated them to invite Furman. One also might wonder, watching this presentation amongst a group of high-achieving, overstressed Harvard students, their backpack-laden peers darting past the windows, how to reconcile Furman’s sentiments with the incentives of the campus. The organizers emphasize Furman’s message of gratitude. “We've had certain opportunities that have given us this position of influence,” Broomfield comments. She and Zuckerman hope that by pledging to donate, students will show gratitude for what they have and derive happiness through helping others.
Prior to the presentation, Shu — after relaying his paper-clip experience — had wondered how Furman might connect record breaking with personal happiness. It seems that the link, for Guiness Champion and Giving Pledge alike, lies in an active practice of gratitude.
After the presentation, Furman reminisced on a personal favorite of his records that he hadn’t mentioned: sack racing. “On the plane going to Mongolia, I decided I was going to see if I could break the record racing against a yak. So I would be in the sack, not the yak, and I would be racing the fastest mile against the yak….I went to a yak farm, and all the locals were actually betting on the yak, and in the end I did beat the yak. It was fun.”

I’ve never been scared of ghosts. I’ve never stayed up staring at my closet door or the shadows cast across the ceiling, worried something was lurking. I always keep music on, and as a kid, I let audiobooks and the sounds of the city keep sonic watch over me. But the noise was to drown out my own thoughts, not voices of spirits. I didn’t feel as though the dead were connected to me or that I needed to communicate with them.
Until now. Maybe it’s not a need, but a curiosity — a pull. I set out to make contact with the realm of the dead. I thought at first that I could serve as a vessel for someone I know to talk to their deceased loved one, but I don’t trust my interpretive abilities yet. With such an emotional subject at stake, I decided that a more removed look at mediumship was the way to go.
One medium who has garnered lots of media attention is Tyler Henry, also known as The Hollywood Medium. There are seemingly infinite clips on the internet of famous and semi-famous people tearing up as he relays messages from their loved ones in the afterlife.
His process seems clairvoyant — he often uses the language of sight, saying “the spirit is showing me…” Tyler claims that he receives information in the forms of all senses and then scribbles them down on a notepad in spouting, imagistic fragments onto which clients often latch. Many of these images point to true aspects of the client’s life, such as an image of Diana Ross, linked to the fact that RuPaul loved to sing The Supremes for his late mother. Yet I find it curious that he primarily works with celebrities, a demographic with easily accessible personal information and lots of liquid assets to spare on these readings.
Maybe I’m being harsh. If his practice brings comfort and closure to people, can I really say it’s wrong?
I decide to try reaching out to spirits through a seance of my own. I remember doing this a few times in high school: Once, in a friend’s backyard, a spirit that claimed to be a dead little girl spelled out my friend’s name. We all freaked out.
Collecting a group of friends and my Ouija Board — gifted to me years ago by an aunt — we assemble in a circle on the hardwood floor of the Co-op library. It’s not quite the witching hour, but midnight approaches and the lights are dimmed. With our fingers light like feathers on the planchette, we wait as I ask for a sign of consciousness.
The beginning is always slow. Eventually, the planchette moves more fluidly and with less hesitation. My inner skeptic wants to explain this with some group dynamic psychology — one friend takes subtle cues from another, like a glance toward one end of the board, a miniscule gesture of the index finger. These cues create a collective entity of communication, something we build together. Our fingers collectively slide to YES, to NO, to spell out answers.
Eventually, we encounter a ghost who likely died in June of ’28 (we assumed 20th century). They identified themself only by initials, but apparently they lived in this house and were killed in a duel. This information seemed intriguing, but not personally relevant to anyone in the room and not as sensational as the Ouija Board Gone Wrong videos I’ve seen online. The conversation lagged after five minutes or so, and it felt rude to keep the spirit from whatever they were up to. So, we said “GOODBYE” via the word printed on the board.
I look to Steve Huff, a YouTube medium, for another DIY approach to accessing this realm. He operates through a “soul speaker” that he combines with a spirit box. The box’s mechanism is rather nebulous to me. Often, a reversed voice is fed as an audio track into the device, and spirits speak by distorting this audio into regular, recognizable speech (with a good deal of reverberation and electronic clipping interspersed). Every now and then, Huff turns a knob on the box, which resembles something like an EKG machine built by WALL-E.
I have no such device. But as many psychics have stressed to me, spiritual energy transcends space and time. So my experience of Huff’s seance through my computer screen is no less real than the seance in Salem that never got back to me about press passes. Or at least that’s what I can tell myself.
Huff says he receives thousands of requests for seances, contacting famous people who have died like Lil Peep, Mac Miller, and XXXTENTACION. The latest popular request is Nipsey Hussle. In the video, Steve states his intentions, calls to the spirit by name and adjusts a dial on the soul speaker. Over the course of the 20-minute video, a few intelligible scraps of dialogue come through. I start to think these words are only sounding like real responses because they are captioned as such, and my brain is just filling in the gaps. I wonder how much of communication is just filling in gaps like these.
In Huff’s seance with Lil Peep, he tries something different. After using the spirit box to hear some words from the departed, he invites his audience to focus on the spirit of Lil Peep so intensely that it is as if he were in the room with us. Huff says love is the key to opening yourself up to spirits. I slip into a meditative state and try to fill myself with love.
If you do it right, you might feel an electric tingling or vibrating sensation on certain parts of your body. This means the spirit is reaching out through the veil and touching you. I feel some nerves sparkling on my arms and the vibration in my head that often comes when I try to tap into my spiritual self. It must be working.
Obviously Lil Peep is not in my room in the flesh. I can’t see him or hear him outside of pictures and music. But like Huff says, energy is not created or destroyed. Could this energetic connection create a conduit for him to exist through us? Is that what we create through focused, channeled mental energy — vacant space for consciousness to spill into? Sitting in my room, with others whose minds are attuned to the same subject, I feel the presence of something that had receded before, in the quotidien jumble of our ego-to-ego social interactions. In erasing myself, I find room for a deeper connection to experiences that do not belong to me, people outside of myself.
So where do all the electrical impulses of your mind go when your body betrays itself? Into the universe, which is you, says Huff. The meditative ritual of sitting with memories of a lost loved one, calling their spirit forward, and letting it exist across the span of many subjectivities is as close to resurrection as I can imagine. Perhaps this kind of conscious, selfless reflection brings us closer to the kind of existence that happens once our time on this plane is up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators from the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services have launched a campaign to raise awareness around drugs and alcohol on Harvard’s campus through Instagram and Facebook posts and signs around campus.
The Substance Literacy Project — rolled out in early March — aims to educate students about possible risks associated with drug and alcohol use, as well as resources available at the University.
“We’re really looking as an office to increase and enhance our engagement with students on campus,” AODS Health Educator and Prevention Specialist Olivia A. T. Sevey said. “And so one goal being to kind of enhance students' understanding of the services that we offer and the other kind of being creating a process where we're intentionally communicating information about substances, risks associated with them, ways to reduce risk intentionally, creating a process where we're giving that information out right regularly to students.”
In particular, the campaign will focus on students’ awareness of different substances, effects of each substance, risks associated with drugs and alcohol, and the impact substances have on various groups on campus. The Substance Literacy Project will also inform students about how AODS can meet students’ needs, according to Sevey.
“We’ll have different content,” Sevey said. “It might be about a different substance. It might be about how we support students, but all of those are within our objectives of the project.”
The Substance Literacy Project — designed as a mass media campaign — constitutes part of what Sevey and Director of AODS Garrett O. Fitzgerald said they hope will be a multi-year effort to increase the impact that AODS has on Harvard’s campus.
“I think it is looking upstream a little bit and kind of creating a baseline of information for that engagement where if you see something and you have questions about the information that we put out or it sparks more questions that you have about a substance, to engage and contact us with questions about it or do your own research,” Fitzgerald said.
As part of the campaign, AODS administrators have circulated data to students about the potential impact of drugs and alcohol. Fitzgerald said they have cited statistics from nationally recognized organizations including the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Drug Abuse.
“One of the things that has been really important to this too is trying to make sure that we’re putting out information that we've vetted by trying to find, like, good research on it and engaging in that way,” Fitzgerald said.
Sevey said she is particularly excited to receive student feedback about the initiative.
“We just launched it,” Sevey said. “So it’s very much the intention that we’ll be assessing it along the way — hoping for feedback engagement with students. If there’s a piece of content or a drug that people want to hear more about, that’s definitely something we’re here for. It is important to have the voices reflected in the content we’re giving out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-four College juniors learned Wednesday afternoon of their selection as inductees into the Alpha Iota chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s oldest academic honor society.
The chapter elects new members to its cohort three times annually—24 juniors in the spring, 48 seniors in the fall, and a final group of seniors shortly before Commencement to “bring the total membership to no more than 10 percent of the graduating class,” according to the chapter’s website.
Wednesday’s inductees were chosen from a pool of 75 juniors who were nominated to apply last month based on their grade-point averages, according to Logan S. McCarty ’96, the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa chapter secretary. After being notified they are up for consideration, students can accept the nomination by submitting their transcripts and two letters of recommendation, which are then reviewed by faculty and current members of the College’s chapter.
“The committees look for depth of achievement within the concentration, and also breadth across the liberal arts and sciences,” McCarty wrote in an email. “This is strictly an academic honor—we don’t look at all at extracurricular activities or other accomplishments.”
Several Junior 24 members, including Comparative Literature concentrator Alex S. Cohen ’20 and Applied Mathematics concentrator Nicolas H. Christianson ’20, said they were eating lunch when they received the acceptance email.
“I thought to myself ‘I just can’t believe this,’” Cohen said. “You never think this kind of stuff will happen to you, you know?”
Anthropology concentrator Julie S. Chung ’20, a former Crimson Editorial editor, wrote in an email that she had been discussing her interest in academia with a mentor when she learned of her selection.
“We had just been talking about the difficulties of moving through [an] institution not made for women, women of color, and other marginalized groups,” she wrote. “So when I got this email, I was completely shocked.”
Chung wrote she has taken “wildly different courses” across disciplines ranging from chemistry to anthropology throughout her academic career.
“I feel like I had developed a core community in these classes that enabled me to thrive,” she wrote.
Jonathan W. Perez-Reyzin ’20, another Junior 24 member and Philosophy concentrator, who learned of his selection in the middle of class, said the news made him feel “some sense of personal achievement.”
“It was really nice to know that pursuing my academic passions had paid off in this tangential way,” he said.
Perez-Reyzin said he solicited recommendation letters from the professors in his department after being nominated.
“I had no idea what Phi Beta Kappa was until a week before I was informed that I was in the running,” he added.
Isabelle K.M. DeSisto ’20, a Government concentrator, wrote in an email that she called her parents immediately after learning the news.
“This is an honor, and it felt very validating, because I’ve worked really hard the past few years,” DeSisto said. “But at the same time I think it’s important to recognize that it’s not the be-all-end-all, because there are a lot of amazing people here who deserve recognition just as much as I do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services shares undergraduates’ mental health evaluations with College administrators before students go on or return from leaves of absence with their permission, Paul J. Barreira, the outgoing director of HUHS, said in an interview April 1.
Barreira said HUHS provides the College with student health information that factors into administrators’ decisions about placing students on leaves of absence, but that HUHS does not play a “decision-making role.”
“If it is a clinical issue — they’re not always clinical — is to give our opinion about the student’s emotional well-being and ability to function from the clinical point of view,” he said.
Barreira also said HUHS takes into account student confidentiality and said medical staff will only provide student information to the College with students’ permission.
“We only share information if the student says yes or if there is already some agreed upon communication,” he said.
College policy allows for students to petition for voluntary leaves of absence, though it occasionally requires students to go on involuntary leaves of absence in certain circumstances, including issues of medical safety.
HUHS input is listed as one of several factors in decisions on leaves of absence. Risk assessment, consideration of student conduct, potential for injury, and the feasibility of alternative solutions are also factors according to the College’s handbook.
When students return from a leave, they must petition the College and follow a checklist provided to them by the Administrative Board. When a student returns from medical leave, they must get HUHS approval.
In cases involving student mental health, CAMHS clinicians compile information — including from outside practitioners — about whether the student should return to Harvard. Clinicians also meet with students and evaluate their readiness to return. CAMHS Chief Barbara Lewis then signs off on a letter to the Ad Board summarizing her office’s findings.
After weighing the letter and other factors, the Ad Board then makes a decision about whether to approve the student’s petition to return.
The factors influencing students’ leaves of absence have come under increased scrutiny in recent months.
A December study assigned Harvard — along with every other Ivy League college — a failing grade for its leave of absence policies and concluded that the Ivies “fail students with mental illness.” In particular, the study criticized Harvard’s policies surrounding petitions to return to campus.
Harvard is also facing a complaint filed with the United States Department of Education alleging its decision to place former undergraduate Ty Pelton-Byce ’20 on mandatory leave constituted disability-based discrimination.
Alicia Pelton, Pelton-Byce’s mother, alleged in the complaint that Harvard administrators considered her son’s depression as a negative factor when deciding whether to put him on a leave of absence and during a review of his case.

After years of motions and hearings, a 2015 lawsuit against Harvard alleging the school failed to closed caption its public online content and provided inaccurate closed captions where they did exist will move forward in federal court.
In the February 2015 complaint, the National Association of the Deaf and four of the organization’s members filed suit in Massachusetts District court, naming the University as well as the College. The plaintiffs claim that Harvard’s online platforms — including YouTube, iTunes U, Harvard@Home, and the Extension School — frequently fail to provide sufficient captioning for video and audio content in violation of federal law.
The initial complaint alleges that Harvard’s “denial” of its content “to deaf and hard of hearing persons” violates the 1973 U.S. Rehabilitation Act — a disability civil rights law prohibiting discrimination from institutions that receive federal financial assistance — and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a statute that prohibits disability discrimination in places of public accommodation.
After NAD requested that Harvard add captioning, Harvard did so for only “a fraction of such content, and even then inadequately,” the complaint stated. By failing to provide adequate captioning, Harvard "deprives" deaf and hard of hearing persons of benefits from its online content, according to the complaint.
On March 28, Federal Judge Katherine A. Robertson denied part of a June 2018 motion from Harvard for judgement in the case. The University had argued in a memorandum that the plaintiff's argument was "overreaching" and based off a "broad" reading of federal disability laws.
Harvard’s memorandum — among other legal arguments — claimed that the school’s online content should not be considered a “public accomodation” and that the plaintiffs did not establish that the online content was offered for the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. Harvard also requested the Court rule that the laws do not apply to third party content posted on Harvard’s websites.
Though the March ruling denied part of Harvard’s request, it ruled that University could not be held responsible for captions on third party content.
University spokesperson Nate Herpich declined to comment on the ongoing litigation but wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard is committed to making its online media more accessible.
“Expanding access to knowledge and making online content accessible is of vital importance to Harvard, and the University remains committed to advancing these efforts,” Herpich wrote.
The March ruling marks the second time Harvard has failed to convince a judge to bring the case to a close. After the case was first opened, the University filed a motion to dismiss or stay in May 2015. In a memorandum written in support of the motion to dismiss, the University claimed that NAD “stretched” the statues of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Harvard’s filings argued these statues did not necessarily require institutions which receive federal funding to locate and caption content, remove any content without captions, or refrain from publishing any content without captions. The filings also stressed what it stated were the logistical and academic consequences of NAD’s interpretation of the law.
“Far from making existing online content more accessible to all, this one-size-fits-all, ‘caption or remove’ approach threatens to degrade the quantity, quality, and ready availability of scholarly and other online content,” Harvard’s filings read.
A judge eventually denied Harvard's motion to dismiss.
A similar lawsuit was filed by the NAD against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015, which is also ongoing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow solicited the Faculty Council’s opinions on how to “foster more open dialogue” on campus at the Council’s bimonthly meeting Wednesday, Council member David L. Howell said.
According to Howell, Bacow told the Council — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s highest governing body — that a lack of respectful conversations on campus in recent months has become a major “campus climate” issue. Howell said Bacow cited an incident at the Harvard Kennedy School last week in which roughly 30 protestors interrupted an event featuring Bacow and Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long.
At the event, students from two campaigns — Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — chanted and lofted signs in the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum, calling for Harvard to divest its nearly $40 billion endowment from companies related to the fossil fuel industry and the United States prison system. Six of the students sat down on the stage.
After Bacow and Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf failed to convince the students to move to the back of the room so that Bacow and Long could continue their presentation, administrators and some audience members left the forum, continuing the event in a nearby classroom to a smaller audience.
Bacow told the Council that he was “concerned” and “disappointed” by the incident, Howell said.
“I think until now his sense was that, however much we may disagree with one another, that we gave each other the chance to speak,” Howell said. “He wasn’t able to speak at all, even after the protestors were acknowledged, and their right to protest was acknowledged, and they were asked to then let him speak on the topic at hand at that meeting.”
Howell said the Council agreed that the incident was “not desirable,” though some members noted a lack of trust between administrators and students may have led the protestors to “assume a kind of malice on the part of their interlocutors.”
“I don’t think we reached any solutions, but he expressed concern about finding ways of having dialogue and mutual trust, I guess that maybe has weakened, maybe not even particularly at Harvard but in our society in general,” Howell said.
Bacow also pointed the Council members towards his recent op-ed in The Crimson addressing the incident at the forum, in which he wrote the students’ protest was an effort to “obstruct the rights” of himself, Long, and audience members.
Ilana A. Cohen ’22, a member of Divest Harvard, previously said in an interview with The Crimson immediately after the Thursday event that an open dialogue between administrators and students calling for divestment is vital to upholding the University’s position as a “responsible institutional actor.”
“We think it's essential that the administration is actually willing to engage with us in a dialogue,” Cohen said at the time. “It's very different to simply put out positions, or make points in articles to The Crimson than it is to actually engage your students in conversation around an issue that is so pertinent.”
The Council also heard a proposal from the Systems Biology Ph.D. program to change its name to Systems, Synthetic, and Quantitative Biology.
The content of the program — which is run by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and draws faculty from FAS and Harvard Medical School — will not change. Rather, the program proposed the change to “better [reflect] the variety of fields in which faculty and students work,” according to Howell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Harvard students and alumni have signed a letter criticizing Harvard Divinity School’s decision not to grant tenure to Ahmed Ragab, who they say is the first Muslim faculty member at the school to come up for tenure.
The letter — addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Senior Vice Provost Judith D. Singer, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay — alleges Ragab is the first scholar at the Divinity School in a decade to be denied a full professorship without receiving a review from an ad hoc tenure committee.
Divinity School spokesperson Michael P. Naughton declined to comment on why Ragab did not receive tenure.
“The School doesn’t comment on individual tenure cases,” Naughton wrote in an emailed statement.
The letter alludes to the findings of the recently completed Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging that called for a more diverse faculty, arguing that the University has failed to follow through on those findings in denying Ragab tenure.
“The significance of his efforts only become more relevant as the undergraduate population continues to diversify, urging the College to live up to its values of diversity, equity, and inclusion,” the letter reads.
Ragab did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The letter also highlights accounts of several students who cited Ragab’s ability to connect with minority students through his teaching and mentorship.
“The decision to deny tenure to Professor Ragab thus carries a symbolic weight that will surely affect the aspirations and confidence of undergraduates from marginalized backgrounds for years to come,” the letter states.
The students and alumni specifically cited Ragab’s research in the field of Muslim studies, which they argue is under-represented at the University, writing that he fills a “crucial gap” in scholarship. They also contend that he is the “most published” of any tenure applicant at the Divinity School in at least the past two decades.
“Denying him tenure reflects on the University’s tendency to resist supporting institutional access to resources for students to engage substantively with Muslim-American and Critical Muslim Studies,” they wrote.
Ragab and his wife, Kirkland House Resident Dean Soha Bayoumi, have not shied away from vocal advocacy during their time on campus. The duo was arrested in Boston in 2017 during a protest against President Donald Trump’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that protects undocumented individuals who had been brought to the United States as children from deportation.
In the letter, students wrote that FAS should review Ragab for tenure “to ensure a fair review.” Though Ragab is also an affiliate of the Department of History and Science, he does not hold a permanent appointment in FAS and is thus not eligible for its tenure-track process.
The outcry over Ragab’s tenure denial is the second time this year that activists have criticized the University’s decision-making in its tenure procedures.
In February, students and alumni sent multiple letters to Bacow after the loss of two tenure-track professors who specialize in Asian-American studies, Associate Professor of Education Natasha K. Warikoo and Assistant Professor of History Genevieve A. Clutario. Warikoo left the University after she was not put up for tenure, and Clutario accepted a position at Wellesley for the coming academic year. The letter connects Ragab’s departure to those earlier departures.
“We wonder if the need for faculty diversity will ever move beyond recognition and manifest in real hiring practices,” the letter reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eight Ph.D. candidates presented their research at the Harvard Horizons Symposium held Wednesday evening in Sanders Theatre.
Launched in 2013, the program seeks to recognize and celebrate the ideas of Ph.D. students at Harvard. Eight students are selected each fall to spend 10 weeks working together with the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning as they improve their communication and presentation skills.
Each of the eight scholars delivered brief presentations about their research topic, methods, and implications of the study.
Jess K. Kanwal, a graduate student in neuroscience, said she was excited about sharing research with people outside of her discipline. She said the Derek Bok Center provided an “incredible amount of help in training and mentoring.”
Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench – who also sits on the Harvard Horizons committee that reviewed and selected the cohort of scholars – said the program focuses on the importance of “understanding deeply” and “explaining simply.”
“I think it’s a very important showcase for what the GSAS does because our students are doing graduate degrees, and often it's not easy to understand what they're really doing, so being able to see that cutting edge research is also extremely interesting, and even fun,” Dench said.
Mateo C. Jarquín, a student in history and one of this year’s scholars, said the program helped him to polish his public speaking skills and better explain his research findings with others.
“The process forces you to ask yourself what is actually the basic and most important aspects of my research that are important to people outside of my tiny subfield,” Jarquín said.
Applied Physics Ph.D. candidate Victoria Hwang said she appreciated having the opportunity to build relationships with the other eight presenters.
“The thing that I value the most is the cohort and the relationships that we built,” Hwang said. “It really is an intense experience. It’s eight of us and we are going through the same thing over 10 weeks and we got to know each other pretty well under situations of stress.”
Dench said the Harvard Horizons program equips students with many transferable skills.
“I think what a lot of the Horizon Scholars find is that this whole process that they go through enables them to write more crisply, even to finish their dissertations more quickly, to be sharper in their presentations,” Dench added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Department officers arrested and charged a College sophomore with disorderly conduct, assault and battery, and assault and battery on a police officer after a violent altercation in and near Pforzheimer House late Saturday night.
The student, James L. Walkingstick ’21, was allegedly “highly intoxicated” when he knocked on the door of Pforzheimer resident tutor Erik C. Nook, according to the police report. Walkingstick then allegedly choked and punched Nook, who then called HUPD, the report states. One of the responding officers, Mark J. Donahue, wrote in the report that Walkingstick attacked him and another HUPD officer, James Leahy, Jr., after they tried to speak with Walkingstick.
The officers arrested Walkingstick, who was subsequently transported to Mount Auburn Hospital to undergo evaluation, according to the report.
Walkingstick disputed some of the language and narrative in the report in an emailed statement to The Crimson, and wrote that he originally intended to seek help from Nook.
“My initial interactions with Mr. Nook were not malicious, but rather rooted in seeking help because of my intoxication. My intoxication blurred the situation when confrontation occurred,” Walkingstick wrote. “I did not initially provoke the officers, but they instead approached me to help based on what I have been told by HUPD. Confrontation led to the struggle. I was intoxicated but did not have drugs in my system, affirmed by a toxicology report.”
Walkingstick wrote that the charges against him were “addressed and resolved” and that he has been in communication with Harvard officials to determine the next steps.
Whether Walkingstick will face further disciplinary action remains unclear. Though Walkingstick wrote that the charges were resolved, a hearing on the case is scheduled for May 8 at the Cambridge District Court.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on behalf of Harvard, Nook, and the College administrators who were first notified of the arrest. She cited the College’s policy of not commenting on individual students.
HUPD Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano also declined to comment, referring to the department’s policy not to comment on pending cases.
The police report states Nook told HUPD that Walkingstick banged on his door Saturday night. After he opened the door, Walkingstick “choked him around his neck and also punched him.” A recording of Nook’s call with a HUPD dispatcher includes clear audio of Nook yelling and violently struggling with Walkingstick, according to the police report.
Walkingstick wrote that he had “no relationship with Mr. Nook, rather than knowing him to be a tutor,” in his email to The Crimson.
Nook told HUPD officers that he was “familiar” with Walkingstick, according to the police report.
The report does not detail what happened immediately after the altercation in Pforzheimer. Donahue and Leahy later received a report of a “male bleeding” near Pforzheimer and located Walkingstick on Linnaean Street with “fresh red abrasions on the cheekbone and jaw of his face,” according to the report. Walkingstick walked toward the officers, who noted that he was intoxicated and tried to speak with him.
Walkingstick then immediately attacked the two officers, who wrestled him to the ground and contained him while he continued to fight, according to the report. Moments later, HUPD Sergeant James Pignone arrived on the scene and helped handcuff Walkingstick, who was then arrested and medically transported.
Walkingstick wrote in his statement to The Crimson that he sustained the injuries on his face after falling while seeking help. He also criticized the language of the police report, writing that the use of words such as “attacked” to characterize his behavior was inappropriate. He wrote that he was instead “distressed and seeking help.”
Leahy and Donahue filed additional reports stating they sustained minor injuries after falling to the ground in their altercation with Walkingstick. Pignone verified Leahy’s injuries in a separate report and wrote that he believes the payment of worker’s compensation for the injuries would be appropriate if requested.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of the American Enterprise Institute and recently appointed Harvard professor of practice Arthur C. Brooks called love the solution to the problem of contempt in American government at an Institute of Politics event Wednesday.
More than 60 people attended the event, which was named after Brooks’s new book “Love Your Enemies.” It began with remarks from Brooks, followed by a discussion moderated by University Professor Danielle S. Allen.
Brooks — who is set to leave AEI and become a professor of the practice of public leadership at the Kennedy School in July — said his book was partially inspired by a question and answer session he had on the same stage two years ago at the JFK Forum.
After the 2017 event, the Kennedy School posted a video on its Facebook page of Brooks describing the Dalai Lama’s advice to show warm-heartedness even in the face of contempt. The video garnered more than 11 million views.
“It's a middle-aged think tank president talking about love that got 11 million views,” he said. “That is absurd. And I thought to myself, there's a book in this.”
Following the video, Brooks searched for solutions to what he calls America’s “love crisis,” which he describes as the growing partisanship and lack of respect among politicians. Advocating for love as the solution to the discord in Washington, Brooks introduced findings from his interdisciplinary study of neuroscience, philosophy, and politics.
“My whole life, I've been involved in institutional answers to big problems,” he said. “The revolution doesn't lie with institutions. The revolution lies in each one of our hearts.”
Allen — who Brooks said he consulted while working on the book — challenged Brooks’s ideas during the discussion period.
“I think it's too big an ask,” Allen said of Brooks’s suggestion to show love to all of one’s political adversaries. She cited Aristotle’s ideas of performing friendship regardless of how you feel about someone, which she called more “fair” to ask of people than love.
At one point during the event, Brooks used the term “Kumbaya” to show that current efforts to foster civility are lacking. Allen, however, challenged Brooks’s argument.
“Our everyday language is a carrier of contempt and my example is Kumbaya,” said Allen, who is African American. “You used it just now contemptuously. When I hear that, I hear my culture being disrespected.”
“Well, I'm obviously not going to say that anymore,” Brooks responded.
Kennedy School student Janice S. Tolbert said the event offered “practical insight on engaging in civil disagreement.”
“I appreciated the point about finding moral consensus with those you disagree with,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A research group led by a Harvard scientist unveiled the first-ever image of a black hole Wednesday morning, drawing praise from both the scientific community and the general public.
The Event Horizon Telescope group, led by Shep S. Doeleman, the assistant director for observation at Harvard’s Black Hole Institute, presented the historic picture at 9:07 am EST, along with scientists at various parallel press conferences around the world.
The image marked the culmination of years of work undertaken by a team of 200 scientists in 59 institutes across 18 countries. The project, to which other scientists at Harvard’s Black Hole Institute also contributed, drew on data collected by eight telescopes whose locations range from Hawaii to the South Pole.
Scientists had long struggled to capture a photograph of a black hole — a region of space with a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape it. The image revealed Wednesday is comprised of a glowing orange ring on a black background.
“This particular galaxy has a jet that emanates from the vicinity of the black hole,” said Abraham “Avi” Loeb, the founding director of the Black Hole Initiative and the chair of Harvard’s Astronomy Department, of the galaxy in which the black hole was found. “What you're seeing is the shadow of the black hole on the background of the emission from the hot gas at the base of the jet.”
In order to construct this image digitally, the team of astronomers at EHT created the equivalent of a lens the size of planet Earth by integrating data from all the telescopes that were part of the project.
“Getting this system of at least eight to ten different telescopes, all entirely different, all working together with receivers and data recording systems, and particularly the clocks — the atomic clocks—to be all, if you want to think of it, in synchrony was an amazing technical achievement,” Harvard astronomy professor Jonathon E. Grindlay said.
He said he does not think it would have been possible to generate this image even a decade ago given the sophisticated technology needed to handle the five petabytes of data – the equivalent of 5 million gigabytes — involved in creating the picture.
According to physics, philosophy, and history of science professor Peter L. Galison ’77, a collaborator on EHT, scientists proposed theoretical arguments for black holes as early as 1916. It was not until the 1970s, however, that researchers substantiated the theory by observing extremely dense areas of matter.
Scientists announced in 2016 that, for the first time, they had detected gravitational waves — which many argued were produced by black holes merging, and therefore were evidence that black holes exist.
Galison said he thinks the image unveiled Wednesday will be more compelling evidence of the existence of black holes to the public than some of the more technical data.
“It’s amazing to be able to say, here's the black hole, the size of our solar system, and bigger, and it has the mass of six and a half billion suns,” he said.
Andrew E. Strominger ’77, a professor of physics and the Assistant Director of Theory at the Black Hole Institute, said he views Wednesday’s image as the culmination of decades of research.
“[The black hole] was an object that was predicted to exist 100 years ago,” he said. “And the fact that it's taken us hundred years to get a clear picture of them is not a measure of how lazy and slow scientists are. It's a measure of how huge the problem is, and with what precision and depth we're understanding the universe around us.”
“It’s something I've been thinking about my entire scientific life, and now I’ve seen it,” he added.
Though Loeb said the image is certainly historic, he said the picture largely corroborated his team’s prior predictions of what a black hole would look like if digitally rendered.
“So the surprising result is that there is nothing surprising,” Loeb said.
This first-ever image prompted such excitement in the public because black holes are a cultural phenomenon imbued with metaphor and mythology, according to Galison.
“There's something paradoxical, intriguing, frightening, and imagination-provoking about black holes,” he said.
Scientists say they think new discoveries are still on the horizon.
“There are some real questions about destruction, what's inside a black hole, and so on, that we might get to the very edge of — or even probe — with this Event Horizon Telescope,” Strominger said.

Francis J. Doyle III began his tenure as dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences with a lot on his plate.
It was 2015, and the school had only just announced that roughly two-thirds of SEAS faculty members — mostly from the Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering departments — would relocate across the river to a soon-to-be-built campus in Allston.
But SEAS was expanding internally too. Harvard’s youngest school had ended the previous academic year with its highest number of concentrators to date — 832 undergraduates — and now had to contend with increased demands on faculty members and teaching staff.
Despite the formidable challenges that loomed before him, Doyle said he was excited to take the helm of SEAS at a time when the school was on a “dynamic.”
“To move to another place and hold an institution at steady state in some position — even if it’s a high position — is not nearly as exciting,” he said in a February interview. “Being part of change and the dynamic associated with program evolution is really exciting for me as an administrator.”
In the three years since Doyle assumed deanship at SEAS, he has overseen a number of projects and initiatives, including finalizing plans for the impending expansion into Allston, supporting efforts to promote diversity at SEAS, and strengthening the school’s industry ties and partnerships with local corporations.
From his time at University of California, Santa Barbara as a professor, researcher, and director, to his time here at Harvard as dean, Doyle’s colleagues have consistently praised his ability to prioritize students and mentorship while also balancing administrative commitments.
John H. Abel, a postdoctoral fellow who was advised by Doyle at UCSB and Harvard, said in an interview December that Doyle’s mentorship has extended beyond the scientific aspects of his work.
“I feel like I got a lot out of his scientific training, but I also got a lot out of the kind of training that he gave me on not just how to conduct science, but how to be a conscientious member of the scientific community,” Abel said.
Prior to his tenure as dean of SEAS, Doyle served as the associate dean for research at the UCSB’s College of Engineering and the chair of the school’s Chemical Engineering department.
Doyle said in an interview November that his training and teaching experiences over the course of his career have exposed him to an “interesting mix of styles and models for programs.”
Through these experiences, he observed firsthand “how leadership was more effective and less effective in various circumstances, how to balance faculty governance with central administration, and how to prioritize the needs of the students in the classroom” — lessons that, in turn, influenced his approach as dean of SEAS.
In particular, Doyle said his time directing the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies in Santa Barbara, Calif., gave him the sense that facilitating the careers of younger faculty members “was where my passion or my energy would lie.”
“I truly derive more pleasure in seeing that I can help direct resources for younger faculty who are in startup mode to get their program launched than any of the excitement associated with getting a grant in my lab,” Doyle said.
Bioengineering Professor Samir Mitragotri, who worked with Doyle at UCSB, said in a December interview that he has witnessed Doyle grow into an effective leader over the 15 years he has known him.
“He emerged as a leader largely through his unique skills in coalescing people around teams that connect people,” Mitragotri said. “What he was really good at is talking to people who are doing different things, their own work, but identifying a common theme that connects all of them.”
Often, when transitioning from professorship to deanship, professors give up their research activities. Doyle, however, still actively conducts research in his lab on campus to generate an “artificial pancreas,” which is currently in clinical trials.
“In some regards, that couldn’t be put on hold,” Doyle said, regarding his decision to maintain his lab. “There’s a medical need, there’s a human need, and we had to go full steam ahead to continue to do that.”
Doyle’s prowess as a leader also manifests in his management of his lab, according to two former lab members.
Abel, who began working under Doyle at UCSB in January 2014 and followed him to Harvard in 2015, said one of his main reasons for choosing Doyle’s lab was that it seemed “exceptionally well-run.” He added that many former lab members shared very positive stories about working with Doyle.
“All of them had remarkably kind things to say — not just about Frank, the scientist, but also about Frank, the person, and especially Frank, the leader of the group,” he said.
Eyal Dassau, a senior research fellow in Biomedical Engineering who trained under Doyle as a postdoctoral fellow at UCSB and followed Doyle to Harvard, echoed Abel’s assessment of Doyle as an effective leader in an email.
“His ability to quickly zoom and identify the engineering challenges always impressed me,” he wrote.
Abel said the way Doyle runs SEAS parallels the way he runs his lab. Central to both is Doyle’s idea that “many different people with different perspectives, different backgrounds can come together and approach the same problems from different angles” to yield the best solution.
He added that Doyle was incredibly supportive as a mentor and never pressured him to immediately have results or come up with some idea.
“I would say that the degree to which he supports or that he gives you the space to try new things and fail is pretty remarkable,” Abel said. “He really doesn’t add a lot of pressure and lets you have the freedom to make the progress that you make in whatever you’re excited about.”
Doyle said in a February interview that maintaining a close connection to the student body at SEAS is one of his foremost priorities.
“Twenty-seven years ago, I became a professor because I love teaching,” he said. “Pulling myself out of the classroom was a sacrifice I made to take this job, but I try to replace that with lots of contact with our students.”
In addition to meeting regularly with student leaders of engineering-related organizations at SEAS and the College, Doyle also serves as a concentration advisor for 15 to 20 undergraduates studying Bioengineering. He said this role has allowed him to “keep a finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the program.”
Several of Doyle’s student advisees praised his commitment to ensuring that the student experience at SEAS is as rewarding as it can be.
“Dean Doyle really tries to get to know each student, which is quite ambitious considering his multitude of responsibilities,” Shelby C. Yuan ’19 wrote in an email.
Yuan wrote that Doyle was always willing to chat with students about their personal interests, with many meetings ending up as an “animated discussion about soccer or running” — two of Doyle’s hobbies.
She added that Doyle often gave students advice about internships, labwork, and post-graduation options, and encouraged them to take advantage of his connections at Harvard and beyond.
“Overall, I think his efforts at maintaining strong advising relationships with students are remarkable, and I hope it’ll stay this way as SEAS grows,” she wrote.
Augusta C. Uwamanzu-Nna ’20 wrote in an email that Doyle once lent her a laptop for three weeks after hers abruptly stopped working. This was especially important, according to Uwamanzu-Nna, since “many of my assignments in multiple classes involved coding and the need to collaborate with peers.”
She added that, as a founding board member of the National Society of Black Engineers, she also meets regularly with Doyle to discuss SEAS’s commitment to promoting diversity, inclusion, and belonging at the school.
“Navigating SEAS as a black woman in engineering is definitely not trivial, but being able to be supported through organizations like NSBE and fundamentally by individuals like Dean Doyle has been great,” Uwamanzu-Nna wrote.
Uwamanzu-Nna wrote that she has appreciated Doyle’s receptiveness to constructive feedback, especially in regards to supporting underrepresented communities. She cited an instance in which she told Doyle she had concerns that none of the five panelists at her SEAS Sophomore Convocation last year was a person of color. This year’s panel reflected her feedback — one of the two panelists, Jeffrey M. Allen ’06, is a black engineer.
Uwamanzu-Nna wrote that Doyle has greatly contributed to her experience at SEAS over the past two years.
“The nature of some of my SEAS courses and the overall SEAS atmosphere has sometimes made me feel robotic and forced to push my emotions and humanity to the background,” she wrote. “However, all of my interactions with Dean Doyle have been the exact opposite, as I feel my voice, emotions, and humanity as a person have been heard, recognized and acknowledged.”
Correction: April 13, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Francis Doyle directed the Sansum Diabetes Research Institute. In fact, he directed the Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies, which worked closely with SDIR.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five Democratic presidential candidates will participate in a town hall co-hosted by CNN and the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School, the IOP announced Thursday.
Presidential candidates Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete P. Buttigieg ’04 will take part in the event on April 22. Beginning at 7 p.m., each candidate will have one hour to receive and answer questions from a live student audience at St. Anselm’s College in Manchester, N.H.
CNN anchors Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, and Don Lemon will moderate the event. Lemon recently visited the Harvard IOP to speak about race, media, and politics. Warren is a Harvard Law School professor emeritus, and Buttigieg attended the College and visited the IOP last week to meet with students.
Harvard IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said in a press release that the opportunity for young voters to interact with presidential candidates is important, and that he looks forward to “the exchange of ideas.”
“The votes of young Americans could be the determining factor in this election,” Gearan said. “Young voters are eager to be engaged and speak directly to those seeking the presidency.”
The event is a collaboration between Harvard’s IOP and the New Hampshire Institute of politics. The audience will include 500 youth voters, more than 200 of whom are expected to be Harvard University students, according to the release.
Student President of the Harvard IOP Anna L. Duffy ’21 said the event is a valuable chance for candidates to demonstrate their ideas to young voters.
“Young voters across the country are looking for presidential candidates to address the most pressing issues that are important to our generation,” Duffy said in the press release. “This is an opportunity for candidates to share their policy platforms, showcase their values, and make the argument for why young voters should support their candidacy.”
The results of the biannual Harvard IOP Youth Poll will be released the same day as the CNN town hall event, according to the release. The survey includes questions about climate change, economic inequality, and gun violence among other salient issues. It is directed at votes ages 18 to 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two weeks of not competing, Harvard track and field looks to continue its promising season as it prepares to take on Yale in a dual meet at the Bulldogs’ track. As with any competition against its arch nemesis, the stakes will be high and there will be history on the line.
This meet will not only provide the victor with a competitive edge at Ivy Heps, but it also serves as an HYOC qualification meet. Athletes who can hit the standard times and marks will be able to go to England and compete against the Oxford and Cambridge teams this summer.
“It’s awesome that we have the opportunity to compete in the oldest track meet in the country, making our rivalry against Yale one of the longest standing rivalries,” freshman thrower Sam Welsh said. “We are all very excited to give our best showing and hopefully bring back another win for America in late June.”
Last year, the men’s team eked out a tight 83-78 victory over the Bulldogs while the women’s team had a dominating performance and came out with a 98-61 win. Both the men and women will want a repeat of last year’s result and continue the momentum they’ve gained from their earlier meets this season.
“The HY meet will give us good experience facing other athletes in the Ivy League and prepare us for outdoor heps,” Welsh said. “If we can do well this weekend, we can do well at heps and have a chance of winning the title.”
A key to a victory on Saturday will be the strength of the team’s relay performances. Coming down to Texas two weeks ago, both the men’s and women’s relay teams had stellar performances, exceeding expectations for the Crimson.
The men’s team consisted of the same group that brought home the Ivy Heps title in the 4x400 during the indoor season. The relay consisting of sophomore sprinters Rodney Agyare-May, Jovahn Williamson, and Kahlil Wassell along with senior middle distance runner Myles Marshall qualified for the finals and ran the second-fastest time in Harvard history with its mark of 3:10.05.
On the women’s side, the 4x400 team showed their versatility as athletes by compromising a group that consisted of both sprinters and hurdlers. Sophomore sprinter Olivia Okoli ran with freshman hurdler Sharelle Samuel and junior hurdlers Karina Joiner and Maya Miklos to qualify for the finals with a time of 3:43.31. Miklos ran one of the fastest splits with a 53.64 400.
The Yale team does not boast the depth of 400m runners that Harvard has, but does have the advantage in the 4x100 relay. At the Sam Howell Invitational this past weekend, the 4x100 relay squad of Ekrem Ayhan, Kyle Macauley, Juma Sei and Vincent Vaughns posted a time of 40.95. Their time is now ranked second in the Ivy League, right behind Princeton’s mark of 40.80.
Another factor that will be integral to a Crimson win will be the performance of their throwers, especially that of freshman Sam Welsh. Welsh has already competed against some of the best throwers in the nation and has already posted a season best of 56.57m in the discus, far exceeding the mark of 46.28m that won the Harvard-Yale meet last season. Despite the increased stakes of this meet, Welsh hopes to treat it like any other.
“I try to treat every competition the same way,” Welsh said. “It is best not to focus on the competition but rather on preparing to do the best you can. Leading up to the meet, I will be doing a lot of visualization and meet simulation throws.”
Finally, what will be critical for Harvard will be their performance in field events such as jumps and hurdles. At the UMass Lowell Invitational, the Crimson had strong showings from their field athletes.
Sophomore jumper Iza Sabharwal had a second place finish in the long jump (5.29m) and a first-place finish in the triple jump (10.71m). On the men’s side, senior pole vaulter Ian West built off his fourth-place finish at Indoor Ivy Heps and placed second with a mark of 4.60m.
The Bulldogs likewise had an impressive showing in the jumps last weekend. In the high jump, Spencer O'Neill had a leap of 1.93m, his best mark of 2019 while Austin Laut jumped to a mark of 4.86m in the pole vault. For the horizontal jumps, Darius Jing placed sixth in the long jump with a mark of 6.63m, while Jimmy Shih placed fifth in the triple jump with a mark of 14.20m.
A Harvard win will hinge on a performance where they showcase their depth and versatility over a Yale team that has been on the rise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both the Men’s and Women’s Tennis teams entered their first full weekend of Ivy League play with some momentum. The men’s team had won their last three, while the women’s team boasted a whopping five straight victories. After the weekend’s matches versus Penn and Princeton, the men’s team matched their counterparts’ five wins in a row, going 2-0, while the women’s team picked up their sixth consecutive win before dropping Sunday’s match versus Princeton.
Men’s
Harvard (15-5, 2-0 Ivy) opened its Ivy League play against Penn on Saturday with a dominant 6-1 performance in Philadelphia. The matchup was a rematch of February’s ECAC Finals, in which the Crimson fell 4-3 to the Quakers away. The victory was Harvard’s fourth in a row, getting them off to a perfect start in Ivy play. The Crimson was quick to pick up the doubles point, going 2-0, and didn’t slow down on its way to victory.
“We came out strong for the doubles point. The guys at number two and three doubles did a really good job of securing the point, and that was good for carrying the momentum into singles.” senior Michael Peters said. “A bunch of the guys made quick work of their matches in singles which was really good.”
In singles play, senior Andy Zhou was first to get Harvard on the board, winning in straight sets in the number two slot. His teammates followed suit, with the Crimson picking up all but one of the singles points. Freshman Steven Sun’s 2-6, 6-0, 6-2 win at number five improved him to a team-best 14-2 in singles on the season.
Harvard kept the momentum going on Sunday with another convincing victory versus Princeton, finishing with a 5-2 victory. This was the third meeting between the two teams this season, with the Crimson winning all three, including one at ECAC championships. Harvard again took the doubles point with back to back wins, with freshmen duo Harris Walker and Steven Sun clinching the point for the Crimson.
Harvard’s young team continued to impress in singles, as both Sun and Walker picked up victories, 6-0, 6-3 and 1-6, 7-5, 10-4 respectively. Fellow freshman Brian Shi added a 6-2, 6-1 in the three spot before sophomore Lane Leschly won in straight sets 6-2, 6-3 at number six to clinch the win for the Crimson.
“It was a great weekend overall, we’re really excited to start off 2-0 in Ivy play,” Peters added. We’re really hoping to carry that momentum into this next weekend when we play Yale on Friday and Brown on Sunday.”
Women’s
Harvard (14-6, 2-1 Ivy) extended their win streak to six matches with its home victory over Penn on Saturday. The Crimson dropped the doubles point, 2-1, before coming back with four consecutive points in singles play. The win improved Harvard to an impressive 11-2 record in front of their home crowd.
Junior Jenna Friedel and freshman Rachel Lim won 7-5 in doubles, before going on to win their singles points as well, winning 6-2, 6-4 and 6-3, 6-4 in the second and third spots respectively. The win was Friedel’s eighth singles victory in a row, and improved her record in the number two slot to 11-1.
“We started off with Penn and it was really quick actually, our team just came out ready to fire.” junior Lexi Milunovich said. “Everyone was fighting in their matches, but we ended up beating them.”
Harvard wasn’t able to keep their streak alive the following day, as they fell to Princeton for their first Ivy League loss of the season. The pairing of senior Erica Oosterhout and junior Natasha Gonzalez continued their strong doubles play as they picked up their team best ninth doubles win, 6-2 while the Crimson ended up dropping the doubles point. Oosterhout kept her momentum as she sailed to a 6-2, 6-0 win in the top spot for Harvard.
Friedel improved to nine straight singles wins, winning 6-1, 6-2 in the second slot for the Crimson. Junior Irene Lu grabbed another point for Harvard, 6-0, 6-2, in the sixth spot, but this wasn’t enough to secure the victory, as the Crimson dropped the remaining three singles matches. The 3-4 loss puts a dent in Harvard’s Ivy League aspirations, but with four conference games remaining, anything can happen.
“It’s a little bit of a heartbreaker that we ended up losing 3-4, but all these matches come down to a couple points.” Milunovich added. “The important thing to remember is that anyone can win on any day, and teams are so closely matched that it’s really whoever wants it more that day.”

At Harvard, we’re all familiar with midterm season, formals season, and “the highlight of my day is passing through the warm spot in front of Canaday” season, but we’re now entering yet another Harvard season: “What are you doing this summer?” season. For freshmen, this might be the first time that summer has seemed so important, and the buzz over “summer stuff” can easily become overwhelming.
If you’ve landed the summer of your dreams, you might be more than happy to answer the “what are you doing this summer?” question. If you’re not sure what this summer will bring, however, that question might be less fun. With countless daily emails advertising summer internships, research, study abroad, and more, it’s easy to feel like everyone else has it all figured out, and you’re just the lone, jobless student who reads more rejection letters than class readings these days.
But if you step away from the Harvard bubble, you’ll realize that while you frantically try to search for opportunities that are still open, your friends outside of the bubble couldn’t care less about their freshman summers and are happily planning (or not planning) stress-free summers. Harvard’s culture around summer internships can be intense, especially as a freshman when most opportunities aren’t targeted at you. However, this should be a big clue: Maybe it’s actually not that important what you do during your freshman summer.
As for me, I stressed profusely over summer opportunities throughout freshman fall and spring, but as someone who didn’t even know her concentration yet, I was overwhelmed with the possibilities and competition. How was I supposed to conduct a targeted and successful search when I had no idea what I wanted to do? In the end, I was driven by a desire to get away from home for at least a few weeks, and ended up proctoring on campus for most of the summer. Was it glamorous? No. But here’s the thing: Once I got past the “what are you doing this summer” question, no one cared anymore. My sophomore summer search hasn’t been hindered by the lack of a “resume boosting” freshman summer. In fact, I could have gained similar professional skills and experiences had I headed home for a low-key summer instead of finding summer plans in Cambridge.
So welcome to “what are you doing this summer?” season. If you’ve found the perfect opportunity as a freshman, good for you! Enjoy it, learn from it, and live your best life. But if you still aren’t sure what you’ll be doing or where you’ll be this summer, the same advice goes for you: Enjoy it, learn from it, and live your best life. No matter what you’ll be doing this summer, freshman summer does not define you in any way, shape, or form: It truly is just not that deep.
