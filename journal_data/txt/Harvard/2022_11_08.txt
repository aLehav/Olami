After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I'm not interested in truth,” Israeli photographer Nadav Kander told LensCulture in an interview over a decade ago. In a way, it was a strange comment for a photographer to make, but it was also an ultimate show of respect for the complexity of his subject.
Kander was referencing his recent project “Yangtze – The Long River,” in which he captures the unseen humanity of China’s most vital waterway amidst the nation’s rapid period of rapid economic development. This development, which began under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s and continues in the present day, has lifted 800 million people out of poverty and constituted “the fastest sustained expansion by a major economy in history,” according to the World Bank. Still, Kander wanted to understand how this unprecedented upheaval affected ordinary Chinese citizens, which led him to make five trips to the Yangtze River over the course of three years, following it all the way from the mouth of the river to its source on the border of Tibet.
Kander implies that photography is a poor means of objectivity, preferring to use it to interrogate the world’s emotional depths. As such, it is only subliminally that his work tells the purest truth about China in the modern era: that for its millions of displaced people, the pace of modernization comes at an immense personal cost. Now, as the nation’s current property crisis unearths old questions about the relationship between development and belonging, Kander’s three-year journey along Asia’s longest river is as much a window into the present as it is to the past.
19 out of 59 photos in Kander’s project depict minuscule human figures beside behemoth-like construction projects in a visceral exhibition of the relationship between the individual and the nation. Using large-format film photography, he is able to capture the grandeur of this dichotomy with uniquely broad framing, a technique he terms “stepping back.” China’s economic miracle has produced a multitude of incredibly real, physical creations that have transformed the lives of its gargantuan population, but their construction often constitutes the loss of an old, familiar reality with a new and uncomfortable one.
In Kander’s work, many people appear lost in their own towns, removed from the life they once lived without actually leaving. According to him, the images highlight “this feeling of man as a whole as quite rootless, quite disassociated with themselves.” And in a beautiful and sacred land permanently altered by countless infrastructure changes, the cost of fantastical growth remains a mystery. By not attempting to provide answers about objective truth and instead invoking a sense of trance, Kander illuminates the only truth about China’s development: its complexity.
Also prevalent in many images is a subtle but unrelenting haze. It wafts in from over the water or the skyline to mystify what lies beyond the people in Kander’s images. In doing so, it creates portions of the images with fewer details than others, drawing the eye to the sharper, more saturated regions which typically contain individuals.
In “Chongqing XI,” this element is very apparent as a hazy, enormous, and unfinished bridge looms over people on the river bank. Although it is unclear how much of this effect is natural versus artificially created, it nevertheless highlights the obscurity of what lay ahead for a population trapped between the old and the new. At the time that these photos were taken, change had clearly arrived, as indicated by the new dams, high-rises, and bridges, but it was always unclear what these additions would look like in the context of a broader life.
Expansive fairytales do not come without a cost, and Kander’s individual stories of displacement, loss, and boundless change mesh together to create a more opaque narrative of a country turned upside down by its radically quick modernization process.
Lastly, the maritime route of Kander’s journey through China itself and the river’s resulting prevalence in his images have tremendous relation to the identity struggle he highlights. This is because although the Yangtze river is timeless, its ever-flowing nature bears a strong resemblance to the ceaseless development of China’s economy and way of life. In the same interview with LensCulture, Kander articulates this view of the river by saying “as soon as you have turned your back once it is a different river because the water has moved on.”
This phenomenon appears visually in Kander’s images. While the river flows, it passes the people of China by. Swimmers observe from docks, fishers reel in from rocky landings, and friends harmonize around a waterfront table, but all watch as the current of history carries them to an unknown place.
Now, more than 15 years later, the Chinese people have again reached uncharted waters. Now as then, Kander’s commentary on the Yangtze River sheds light on the impact of the issue. Amidst a widespread housing crisis that began with property developer China Evergrande Group’s debt default, many of the themes Kander highlighted are again front and center. This time, however, the narrative is slightly different. Currently, more than two million off-plan homes remain unfinished throughout China. And although construction and displacement have been inseparable from the country’s economic growth, now is the first time in recent memory when the human cost of development — solitude, displacement, and loss — will be futile. According to Capital Economics, roughly 30 million apartments remain unsold, with upwards of 100 million bought but unoccupied. This trend, although different in circumstance from the mass urbanization of the last 40 years, will catalyze mirror images of Kander’s work and evoke the same emotions that millions of Chinese citizens are already familiar with, but this time without the counterbalancing positive effects.
And although the figures of China’s unparalleled economic success and poverty reduction are widely interpreted, it is equally important to understand the lesser-told story of this period: the emotional side-effects of mass development. Importantly, it is by telling these stories that photography as a medium truly stands apart. To understand how Chinese citizens in the present day may think about current developments, let alone recognize the hardships of the Chinese people in achieving the success they have, it is pivotal to look to Kander’s timeless art. This is because rather than succumb to the gravity of China's collective success story, it tells a lesser-known tale — that of the nation’s ferocious movement away from its pre-miracle identity.
—Alexander J. Gerstenhaber’s Column “F4: The World in Pictures” is an appreciation of the photography that tells untold stories about the joys, hardships, and realities of the world’s people.

Painting conservator Sally Woodcock got right to the point when discussing mummy brown pigment during Harvard Art Museums’s “Conversations Around Funerary Portraits.” In short, she said, it’s “paint made out of people.
This online event was held in conjunction with the museum’s “Funerary Portraits from Roman Egypt: Facing Forward” exhibit — a display which brings Roman-period Egyptian portraits to life at the museum through a guided discovery of the role of funerary portraits, rituals, and even pigments.
At the Oct. 12 event, Woodcock spoke with Harvard Art Museum’s Director and Senior Conservation Scientist, Narayan Khandekar about one particular pigment’s complicated history.
In 1996, Woodcock published a widely influential article entitled “Body colour: The misuse of mummy,” in which she details the production, history, and use of pigments made from the bodies and wrappings of mummies. Woodcock stated that of all her papers, this is “the one people ask about most.” With her proven expertise on mummy pigment and Khandekar’s experience as curator of the Forbes Pigment Collection, this Zoom conversation featured an impressive body of knowledge and ignited curiosity about the infamous morbid pigment.
Khandekar and Woodcock took inventory of their collective insights to examine the origins of mummy brown and trace its usage through art history. Woodcock explained that the bituminous paint was initially prized among painters for its smooth handling in application. Though portraits using mummy are difficult to identify, she clarified, the pigment has been recognized in the palettes of influential painters like Eugene Delacroix and Martin Drolling.
The paint isn’t a perfect find, however — it begins to crack and fade with time. A lack of demand and a waning number of available mummies meant the production of mummy brown was dwindling by the 1910s. Still, companies like C. Roberson and Co. continued to include mummy pigment in artist catalogs until over a decade later.
The conversation then turned to the evolving attitudes toward mummy brown. Beyond its utility as an art material, the pigment was largely desired for its connection to ancient Egypt. Khandekar and Woodcock discussed its function as a tangible manifestation of the 18th and 19th century fixation on Egyptian society.
According to Woodcock, the paint acted as a form of macabre souvenir; this only exacerbated the perception of Egypt as exotic and foreign, its people exempt from personal resonance in the Western world by distance, time, and culture. As such, painters and manufacturers didn’t afford the mummified individuals the same reverence as deceased individuals from the Victorian era. Paint made from the bodies of mummies was briefly accepted due to the difficulty Western society had in “recognizing that they were human, like us,” Narayan Khandekar said.
Woodcock countered with a story of a painter by the name of Edward Burne-Jones. Upon learning of the origins of the content of the paint in his palette, Burne-Jones reportedly conducted a Christian burial in his backyard for the tube. The dissonance between Christian and Egyptian funerary traditions was not lost on the speakers, but they noted that Burne-Jones’s discovery marked an increased awareness of the pigment’s sourcing in the art world and a shift in the sensitivity of museums to human remains such as those in mummy brown in their collections.
Nonetheless, Khandekar and Woodcock discussed the echoes of 19th century mummy portraits in modern times. Though mummy brown is no longer used in painting, Woodcock added that she finds a striking parallel in today’s industry of portraiture with the ashes of loved ones. Incorporating human remains into artistic materials much like the mummy pigment, this practice integrates the memorialized individuals themselves into the memorial art. “I still find it quite strange,” she said.
Tubes of mummy pigment are on display in the exhibit “Funerary Portraits from Roman Egypt: Facing Forward,” which is open at the Harvard Art Museums through Dec. 30.

Long-awaited Halloweekend has quickly come and gone, bringing with it the expected tricks, treats, and fashion feats that form a cornerstone of this fall’s fearsome festivities. Students from Harvard Yard to the Quad took this once-a-year opportunity to show off their costumes and make-up skills. This Halloween featured both bold, creative costumes and fresh takes on familiar classics, with a notable emphasis on the nostalgic. Keep scrolling for a small selection of this weekend’s scary style.
“Never sleep again… unless you’re in Quincy House,” said Mestre, in her Freddy Krueger costume. Given this dream demon’s house pride, Quincy House may just be better than a crucifix to protect you this Halloween. Classic horror never dies — nor does it sleep.
To quote Sally from the classic Tim Burton film, “I sense there is something in the wind.” Whether it’s the impending doom of the second round of midterms or just the brisk New England fall air, at least for this weekend, the Pumpkin King and his queen can scare away our sorrows.
It’s not Halloween without a vampire or two roaming the streets. This gothic, blood-smeared look remains a favorite from year to year, and it’s not hard to see why.
For this artist, her face was her canvas. “Halloween is the perfect time for artists to show off their abilities,” said Wiesenbauer, reflecting on her surreal skeleton makeup.
Dressed as Margaret, the ghost that haunts the Cabot Library suite, she posed for pictures with fellow quadlings at Semper Corpse, a Cabot House-sponsored Halloween carnival on the Quad Lawn. Her costume was filled with house spirit — in more ways than one.
Given their backgrounds in engineering, swimming, and finance, respectively — don’t think too hard about the last one — the costumes, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades came as a natural fit for this friend group.
Singing the “Kim Possible” theme song — “Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me, when you wanna page me, it’s okay” — Almoussa, Aubert, and Bootz paid homage to the early 2000s in their group costume.
Representing the luscious imagery of Studio Ghibli, this Howl costume from “Howl’s Moving Castle” brings us all back to a simpler time.
Some like it hot while others prefer the innocence of childhood, but Conway isn’t satisfied with one or the other. Lavagirl from “The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl” continued the theme of early 2000s nostalgia, as does Ma, the second Kim Possible of the evening.
“I’ve always been a huge Beatles fan,” said Bartel, and it shows. With kaleidoscope glasses and diamonds painted on her cheeks, this “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” costume may take the spot of most creative this Halloweekend, and John, Paul, George, and Ringo would certainly approve.

“Even if we do root among the stars, we will die,” author John Green said to his packed audience at Harvard’s Memorial Church on Oct. 14.
A famed young adult writer and the author of the more recent, tongue-in-cheek reflection on human existence “The Anthropocene Reviewed,” Green did not shy away from existential crisis during the first of this year’s four lectures in the Memorial Church William Belden Noble Lecture Series. Speaking from the pulpit in the church, he discussed the temporality of human existence, existential grief, and how to maintain hope through it all in his enthralling lecture, “How the World Ends.”
A seemingly endless line pressed against the doors of Memorial Church prior to the lecture. Dozens of hopeful audience members had the area surrounding the church buzzing with excitement. Among the crowd was Boston Siebold ‘25, who expressed her anticipation while waiting to be admitted to the sanctuary.
“I’m really excited to hear him speak. I got here early, and all of a sudden, there was a line all the way to Widener,” Siebold said.
A bestselling author, co-creator of the Crash Course educational Youtube channel, and now a TikTok star, John Green has grown to possess a level of fame that warrants an immense crowd Friday.
Others in line, including Niyathi Chagantipati ‘26, had been familiar with Green’s work for a long time before dedicating their weekday evening to him.
“He got me through my history class. He’s the reason I made it to Harvard, and I think it’s so cool that I get to hear him on campus now,” Chagantipati said.
Once inside, the many fans packed into the church pews erupted with thunderous applause, laughter, and silent awe. For audience members like Lola DeAscentiis ‘26, John Green’s talk was worth the wait.
“I was at first shocked to hear John Green, who I know from Crash Course, discussing such deep and somewhat dark topics. However, I ended up really enjoying the talk and got a lot out of it,” DeAscentiis said.
Framed by the ornate design of the Church Sanctuary, Green eloquently struck a precarious balance between the levity and reverence needed to approach such a heavy topic as the apocalypse. The audience was receptive to both his humor and his earnestness, sending laughter reverberating through the sanctuary at his opening words.
“I feel like I am an elephant,” Green said. “I don’t know how to be an elephant. I don’t know what’s going on.”
Though these remarks referenced his feelings about speaking at Harvard, they also expressed the depth of confusion about human existence. Green’s lecture asked and explored the question of how we should view our existence through the lens of its termination, or in his words, how to operate in “a world we know will end.”
He examined at once the landslide of human actions tumbling toward the world’s end and the unique experience of both causing and suffering from our actions, describing this inescapable dissonance of modern human consciousness.
“[It’s] to be finite, but able to conceive of the infinite, to be mortal, but able to conceive of immortality, to be able to end ourselves, but not save ourselves,” he said.
Green emphasized that the decline in Earth’s habitability most rapidly and severely harms the innocent and vulnerable among us. “I’m sure we’re right to worry,” he added.
Far from merely outlining our plight, Green tackled the provocative question of whether or not humanity is worth saving. In the face of climate change, social injustice, and grief, are we worth the effort of delaying our demise? Green ultimately defended humanity’s bright spots.
“Holiness and goodness is right here in the midst of our world… right smack in the middle of our own little lives,” he said.
This optimism was woven throughout Green’s lecture, encouraging the audience (both those attending in-person and virtually) to improve their existence in addition to illuminating the scope of humanity’s self-forged apocalypse.
John Green’s presentation was not far removed from the legacy of the Noble Lectures, which were established in 1898 by the mourning widow of William Belden Noble, Nannie Yulee Noble. Born of grief, the Noble lecture series seeks to create hope and positivity. Green’s contribution to the series reflected an urgent call for hope — optimism for the worth of humanity, mobilized for the fate of humanity. In a way, John Green curated his lecture in memory of human existence. His words assembled a time capsule of humanity’s faults, hopes, and ideas — a poetic contingency plan for our species’ end.
Green concluded the lecture with this somber idealism. “Yes. The end is coming … but not yet.”

The Season Two premiere of “The White Lotus” begins at the end of a week in paradise with a gorgeous Mediterranean beach, free-flowing Prosecco, and the discovery of a potential murder, or perhaps several.
Following the formula of its previous season’s pilot (which began with a closed body bag and little context), the HBO comedy-drama’s new installment jumps back in time after this jarring cold open — thus establishing the apparently grim destination of the season’s seven-episode run. For now, however, viewers are left to get acquainted with the assorted group of ultra-privileged guests beginning their stay at the exclusive and endlessly luxurious White Lotus resort.
The critically-acclaimed satire first premiered in July 2021 and was originally intended to be a six-part limited series; however, its popularity quickly led to a renewal by HBO. The first season — which received 20 Emmy nominations and took home 10 wins including Outstanding Limited Series — detailed a week in the life at a Hawaiian location of the fictional global resort chain, following a handful of dysfunctional guests, overworked staff, and disgruntled resort manager Armond (an excellent Murray Bartlett.) In a clever expansion of its original premise, the show’s distinctive brand of dark humor and biting exploration of social themes continues with a new cast at The White Lotus: Sicily.
This time around, the boat of new arrivals includes Dominic Di Grasso (Michael Imperioli), a Hollywood director traveling with his father Bert (F. Murray Abraham) and son Albie (Adam DiMarco) to visit his grandmother’s village. Generational differences are quickly brought to the forefront as Dom and Albie, a mild-mannered recent Stanford grad, attempt to curb Bert’s completely inappropriate, outdated approach to interacting with the women around him. This familial grouping allows for a clever exploration of masculinity across generations, exposing Dom’s own hypocrisy: Viewers are given glimpses into the reality of his personal life, where his actions and familial relationships don’t necessarily align with his ideals (“I’m a feminist. I mean, I didn’t marry some subservient wife”).
Jennifer Coolidge reprises her role as Tanya McQuoid-Hunt, a troubled woman who frequents White Lotus resorts around the world (she’s now a member of the Blossom Circle!). Returning alongside Tanya is her now-husband Greg (Jon Gries), another guest at the White Lotus Hawaii, where the two began their whirlwind romance. This year, the couple is joined on vacation by Tanya’s trendy young assistant Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), much to Greg’s dismay. Shirking Greg’s angry request to send Portia home, Tanya instead secretly exiles Portia to her room — leaving this season’s Gen Z mouthpiece to dodge both Tanya and Greg for the duration of the trip.
Arriving alongside the DiGrassos and McQuoid-Hunts are two married couples who seem to share a strained friendship: the newly-rich tech engineer Ethan (Will Sharpe) and employment lawyer Harper (Aubrey Plaza) have been invited to join Ethan’s pompous college roommate Cameron (Theo James) and his wife Daphne (Meghann Fahy) on vacation. While Ethan and Harper seem relatively grounded compared to several of the show’s more overtly crooked characters, Cameron and Daphne are, as Harper puts it, are “People that brag about taking helicopters to the Hamptons and being friends with Jeff Bezos.”
Rounding out the season’s main cast (so far) are Lucí (Simona Tabasco), a local hustler and sex worker, and Mia (Beatrice Grannò), an aspiring musician. The girls’ schemes to catch the attention of wealthy vacationers are constantly thwarted by Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore), the resort’s demanding manager, and certainly another key player.
A major strength of the show’s first season was its ability to weave together the stories of its ensemble, as the paths and fates of guests, staff, and locals overlapped and intertwined — and the Season Two premiere is undoubtedly promising on this front. Its cast of characters are both individually and collectively compelling, representing a spectrum of experiences and perspectives. Furthermore, the premiere offers several delicious peeks into the cracks forming in existing relationships. The show retains its idiosyncratic and sardonic sense of humor, and Aubrey Plaza’s characteristically deadpan delivery makes her a comedic standout, especially as Harper navigates interactions with Cameron and Daphne — a couple whose willful ignorance is both hilarious, and, unfortunately, very believable. (“I’m so over the whole news cycle!”)
The sun-soaked premiere also subtly hints at the many narrative and tonal layers that will be peeled back as the season inevitably shifts into increasingly dark themes. Just as each character brings their own baggage, the resort, too, seems to carry something sinister within its walls: Beneath this idyllic scenery runs an ominous undercurrent that reveals itself in lulls and moments of uncertainty — and the resort’s beautiful, historic decor appears distorted and unsettling to the characters themselves at times.
With a compelling cast, novel picturesque setting, and the promise of several interesting slow-burn story arcs, “The White Lotus” is off to a strong start in Sicily. Time will tell if the show’s revival as an anthology series will ultimately feel redundant — or refreshing as an Aperol Spritz.

Trending on TikTok, Vogue, and food networks alike, seasonal eating has rightfully gained popularity in the food world and promotes a sustainable model for home-cooking and restaurant culture. Though eating seasonally has always been a part of human consumption, the resurgence of this food model grounds produce and consumers alike back to the local earth. Studies show seasonal fruits and vegetables are not only more nutritious due to their proper maturation time, but also offer a sustainable alternative to traditional groceries.
The idea behind seasonal eating is not new. Centering food around readily available produce is fundamental to cultural and regional recipes. However, with the rising environmental toll of year-round produce cycles, there’s been a resurgence of eating and cooking with local ingredients in order to minimize individual impacts on climate change. Seasonal eating promotes consuming nutrient-dense foods, as the farm-to-table model becomes a reality and optimizes the natural maturation cycle of produce while supporting local growers.
Here’s a list of seasonal items and recipe ideas you should look out for in New England this fall season:
Apples and Pears: Apples and pears are best between the months of September-October, and are great on-the-go options for snacks. Apple cider donuts, sweet-harvest salads, or a simple dessert-roast with honey and sugar set the mood for the start of fall.
Cauliflower: From a meat alternative to a vegetarian forward centerpiece, cauliflower is a sponge for flavor that can be used in almost any recipe for an added source of fiber and B-Vitamins. Try it in tacos, or substitute a normal pizza dough with a cauliflower crust for a nutrient-dense alternative.
Cranberries: A Massachusetts-grown staple, cranberries are a great source of natural antioxidants that help fight infections and promote heart health. Substitute them anywhere you’d use summer berries (like breads, pies, or drinks) for a sustainable and locally grown alternative.
Root Vegetables: Carrots, radishes, turnips, and beets provide a wide variety of options for fall eating. Packed with Vitamins A, B, C, potassium, manganese, and iron, root vegetables provide diverse options for nutrition. Simple roasts with turmeric, rosemary, or thyme elevate their naturally sweet flavors and pair well as a side dish to any meal.
Winter Squash: As some of the most versatile fall vegetables, squash are a powerhouse of nutrients full of carotenoids, natural anti-inflammatories, complex poly-saccharides, fiber, and Vitamins A, B, and C. From breads and soups to pastas and dinner centerpieces, pumpkins and winter squash are some of the most iconic and delicious autumnal produce.
Farmer’s markets in the Boston area are stocked with produce farmed locally and often present better deals than the nearest grocery store:
Haymarket runs year-round and boasts a Boston city staple for fresh produce with great deals every Friday and Saturday until 4:00 p.m.
Central Square Market offers a local option for seasonal produce on Mondays from 12pm-6pm until Nov. 21.
If you need a midweek pick-me-up, Davis Square Farmers Market runs on Wednesdays from 12pm-6pm until Nov. 23 and is a two-stop train ride away from Harvard Square.
Eating locally and seasonally is a win-win situation since consumers get the freshest produce while supporting local growers in the process.

The program reviewed in this piece was performed at Symphony Hall on October 20, October 21, and October 22, 2022
Silence filled the hall as Andris Nelsons’s outstretched hands hung over the conductor’s podium. A smattering of stray claps echo from the back, crescendoing into a thunderous rumble. The ground stirred, awakening from what seemed like an eternal slumber. The audience, transfixed, was finally released from the bondage of transcendental music.
Replete with dream-like colors and textures, Thursday, Oct. 21’s performance of Gustav Mahler’s Sixth Symphony at the Boston Symphony Orchestra was indeed a spellbinding affair. Yet, the Boston Symphony Orchestra did not succeed at achieving the highest aim of all symphonic compositions — exposing a composer’s revelation to the world. Mahler’s Sixth has garnered the subtitle “Tragic” for a reason, and Nelsons’s interpretation of the work — though aurally satisfactory — did not convincingly showcase the intensity of expression or compositional nuance of the score.
In many respects, Mahler’s Sixth Symphony is a torturous work. Over the course of four relentless movements, the composer continually deprives the listener of a sure-footed resolution. Instead, he forcefully oscillates from moments of heavenly lyricism to musical lines choked with angst, mapping the entire scope of human conflict and resignation. The work’s powerful finale, marked by originally three, but later revised to two, hammer blows compels the listener into accepting the futility of struggle. No tune, no matter how triumphant, eclipses fate's call. The legendary conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler thus considered Mahler’s Sixth to be “the first nihilistic work in the history of music.” Likewise, German-born conductor and composer Bruno Walter — a close friend and advocate of Mahler’s work — wrote that the Sixth “ends in hopelessness and the dark night of the soul.”
Throughout the evening’s performance, the orchestra crafted wonderful phrases with natural beginnings but lost the tragic impulse of Mahler’s music as a result. Nelsons thus produced an agreeable and inoffensive listening experience at the cost of fully replicating the tension within Mahler’s composition.
The orchestra’s performance of the first movement — marked Allegro energico, ma non troppo, Heftig aber markig — was riveting in some moments, and unconvincing in others. The ensemble attacked the introductory march of the first movement with trademark ferocity, perfectly capturing its rhythmic urgency and foreboding tone. The movement’s delicate cowbell interlude was simply transcendental; for a moment, the Austrian Tyrol came to life inside Symphony Hall to the accompaniment of a weightless tremolo from the violins.
Yet, Nelsons’s first rendition of the lyrical theme following the darkly colored march — known by some critics as the “Alma” melody — lacked the intensity of phrasing demanded by such an aching expression of love. The development section felt most in need of tightening; the tension within each phrase felt released too early, like a bow let loose before being fully drawn. Finally, in the movement’s concluding A major chorale, the soaring brass section masked the strings and percussion, as if coating the thickly-layered musical canvas with murky varnish.
The second movement of the night — the Scherzo: Wuchtig — was the most distasteful element of the entire performance. Nelsons liberally chose a slower tempo than usual, forsaking any sense of musical impulse. The orchestra performed the incessant introductory theme with vigor. Yet, the phrasing felt heavy-handed. The brush-like strokes of the strings, slowed to Nelsons’ preferred lumber, lacked any observable tension. The trio —marked Altväterisch (“old-fashioned”) — was unforgivably weighty. What Alma Mahler described as representing the “arrhythmic games of the two little children, tottering in zigzags over the sand” became a bumbling bar dance between two drunkards. There was no boyish buoyancy in Nelson’s interpretation.
On the contrary, the orchestra’s performance of the third movement —the Andante moderato — approached musical perfection. The string section conveyed the ideal mixture of lyricism and direction in the wandering opening theme. From this breathtaking starting point, Nelsons proceeded to reveal each layer of the composition with stunning precision and effortlessness. Every musical phrase felt tight, but not overly so. Nelsons’ forte is crafting natural, singing lines, and he did so in the development section with finesse. At the climax of the movement — a richly textured recapitulation of the main theme — the orchestra seemed to lift the audience above reality, even for one transient movement. The ensemble revealed infinitesimal spaces between each yearning note and fully-fleshed phrase. Peering into Mahler’s fantasy through this orchestral peephole, a symphonic world seemed to reveal itself. This was music-making at the highest level.
Nelsons rendered the Finale — Mahler’s fatalistic last hurrah — with dynamism. Yet, much clarity was left to be desired. Throughout the movement, the strings snarled with palpable ferocity, but the sound signature itself could have benefited from more articulated bow strokes. Although the three false climaxes — each capped with a deafening hammer blow — resonated brilliantly, the intervening contrapuntal textures failed to deliver the necessary definition. The symphony’s end, however, was striking. The brass and woodwinds’ repetition of the recurring A minor triad was spin-chilling. A phantasmic pizzicato from the strings floated the movement to a satisfying, transparent close. Yet, one has to wonder, could it have been just a bit softer?

For viewers who have not yet seen “Game of Thrones” or “House of the Dragon,” spoilers are revealed below.
With its finale just released on Oct. 23, “House of the Dragon,” the very anticipated prequel to “Game of Thrones,” made headlines. The mini-series’ 10 hour-long episodes examine the backstory of the dreaded, notorious House Targaryen, setting up the storyline for the original show.
“House of the Dragon” brings us back about two centuries to the height of House Targaryen’s control over the Iron Throne and its claim to power in Westeros. The series, which explores the importance of bloodlines, broken friendships, naïvety, and the legitimacy of one’s heirs, throws us right back into the bloody, merciless world of “Game of Thrones.”
Like “Game of Thrones,” “House of the Dragon” spans many years, continuously building towards the inevitable conflict of the ending. In the very beginning, the two main characters, Rhaenyra (Milly Alcock/Emma D’Arcy), the later-announced heir to the Iron Throne, and Alicent (Emily Carey/Olivia Cooke), the future queen, are the best of friends. Over the course of the series, however, the two friends grow apart and eventually become foes, as each tries to ensure the safety of their children and their future as leaders of Westeros.
To deal with the significant time jumps between episodes, the producers of “House of the Dragon” decided to impose major cast changes, with only a few actors appearing throughout the entire season.
In such intricate shows, cast changes often spark debates about character growth and continuity. With multiple actors playing the same role, it can often feel as if each actor is not given adequate time to develop their relationship with the audience. Additionally, fitting over 10 years’ worth of action into a roughly 10-hour series is naturally going to result in the omission of some story elements, potentially sacrificing character development for the plot. The producers of “House of the Dragon,” however, were able to smooth out the edges to make the series fluid and coherent. Furthermore, the cast changes, while abrupt, make the evolution of each individual more realistic.
Notably, the characters whose actors changed in the series were also the characters who evolved the most. For example, the old King Viserys (Paddy Considine), his younger brother, Prince Daemon (Matt Smith), and the hand of the king, Sir Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans), retained the same actors throughout the entire series. Was this because their age differences could be portrayed on the same actor? Or, was it because these characters generally retained the same positions and qualities throughout the entire series, a quality emphasized by their lack of physical change? Indeed, this directorial choice enables the audience to pay more attention to the other characters, playing on our own concepts of stability and evolution.
Furthermore, double-casting for the roles of Princess Rhaenyra, Queen Alicent, and their children was particularly effective. These changes specifically accentuate Princess Rhaenyra and Queen Alicent’s extreme separation and the hate they begin to have for each other as time passes. Also, because their children also start out as friends, the audience witnesses them growing away from one another as a result of their mothers growing apart as well. In the final scene featuring Emily Carey as young Alicent and Milly Alcock as young Rhaenyra, Alicent enters wearing green, the color of her family’s war banners –– a bone-chilling moment that foreshadows the division in store for the future of House Targaryen. While these two actors did not return in subsequent episodes, this was a perfectly subtle, encapsulating finale for the two: Their era of friendship was over. Overall, “House of the Dragon”’s ability to make viewers invested in the characters and plot despite these turnovers is absolutely a testament to the quality of the show.
Aside from the careful design and implementation of division and the use of cast changes to create a foundation for the story, one important aspect of “House of the Dragon” was its subtlety in conveying the evolution of characters and the passage of time. One particularly striking moment of this intricacy was how, when nearing the end of his life, King Viserys wears a mask of gold to hide the decay of his face and body. While this mask projects power and austerity to those on the outside, after the removal of his mask, we see the rot and decay underneath the veil of gold — a metaphor, perhaps, for the symbolic rot that is currently consuming the inside of House Targaryen, under a layer of power and prestige.
Overall, each episode effectively built upon the last, with limited but carefully-curated action scenes that seem to suggest an eventual final battle. However, after patiently watching each episode in anticipation for a final throwdown, viewers might be disappointed to learn that the whole series only sets the scene for the next season, or maybe even the next couple of seasons. While the slow-burn plot may be upsetting for “Game of Thrones” fans who are used to receiving closure at the end of a season, the producers have surely secured a devoted audience for the next season of “House of the Dragon.”
With only a slight idea of what’s to come from watching the original “Game of Thrones,” all I can now say is: Let the “Dance of the Dragons” begin.

Most are familiar with the big names of jazz: Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and more. And while these artists remain iconic to this day, it may seem that the golden age of jazz ended in the 20th century.
23-year old Laufey Lín Jónsdóttir, more commonly known as Laufey (pronounced “lay-vay”), is seeking to change this perception.
Born in Reykjavík, Iceland, Laufey is half-Icelandic and half-Chinese, and spent her childhood moving between Reykjavík and Washington, D.C. She grew up surrounded by classical music — her mother was a classical violinist — but has previously described old jazz music as her “first love.” In particular, she recalls how her father had a collection of Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday records that he would frequently play. And so as she grew older, Laufey began to try to use her own musical endeavors to revive jazz for a younger generation.
Based on the turnout at The Sinclair on Sept. 27, she is making significant strides. The Cambridge show, along with the majority of her other tour dates, were sold out, despite this being her first tour.
Laufey began with song “Fragile” from her debut album “Everything I Know About Love,” released on Aug. 26. When attending concerts, especially those of newer artists, fans may be apprehensive about whether the singer can deliver vocally in a live performance. Laufey, however, quickly demonstrated that her signature smooth, milk-and-honey vocals would not disappoint.
Throughout the night, she provided a stellar performance of both singles as well as tracks from her EP and the debut album, including some lighter, more upbeat tunes like “Best Friend,” as well as melancholy tracks like “Let you break my heart again.” Accompanied by minimal instrumental backing for most of the show — as is the nature of her songs — Laufey’s dreamy voice and telling lyrics were able to shine as the stars of the night.
The crowd, for its part, was consistently active and engaged. From the get-go, the hall was filled with audience members singing along to most of Laufey’s lyrics despite the relatively recent release of her completed record. Towards the end of the set, many fans even took this participation a step further and harmonized with her.
The audience interaction is a testament to Laufey’s charming persona and dedication to connecting with her fans. Whether it was personally accepting all of the gifts offered to her, discussing with the crowd about potential names for her cello, or taking a fan’s phone to snap their BeReal, Laufey constantly engaged with her dedicated fans throughout the night.
This tour date, in particular, felt special because of Laufey’s connection to Boston: She attended and graduated from Berklee College of Music. Onstage, she spoke extensively about her early musical endeavors while still at school, writing many of her songs from her dorm room. She also shared an anecdote about the songwriting process of one of her most popular songs, “Street by Street,” which she had written about Boston and reclaiming its streets (and her own life) from the memories she had made with a failed love interest. Notably there was also a significant presence of Berklee students within the audience, who made their excitement and presence known by cheering on their school alumnus and using their own musical talents to sing along. Aided by the fact that The Sinclair is by nature a smaller venue, the feel of the evening as a whole was less that of an audience listening to an artist they love and more of a familiar community celebrating one of their own.
Laufey truly demonstrates all the makings of a star. Hearing about her unique childhood and musical background may spark one’s interest, but just one listen to her actual work has the power to immediately turn a curious first-time listener into a captivated fan. The truth is that Laufey has not only a complete mastery over her voice, but also possesses a gorgeous, soothing tone that is difficult to find among other artists today. Combining this with her original sound, personal charm, witty songwriting, and other various talents in her musical toolbox (she plays piano, cello, and guitar), Laufey is an admirable artist all around.
Most compelling of all, perhaps, is the musical niche that she has found herself in: Laufey is leading a revival of jazz in a modern context. It is abundantly clear that she has a deep love and appreciation for the genre, and it is this singular love for jazz that drives her desire to share it through her own artistry. Laufey is able to find and maintain a glorious balance of keeping the iconic heart and sound of jazz alive, while reshaping it for discussions of love, loss, friendship, and life that resonate soundly with younger generations today.

“Rule number one is I need you to scream every lyric as loud as you fucking can,” soul pop singer Remi Wolf demanded of Boston’s Roadrunner’s animated crowd at her Oct. 9 show.
Wolf’s already hit Boston a couple times this year as both a headlining act for her own tour in February and a supporting act for Lorde’s show in April. As such, she faced the prospect of a lethargic reception at her third performance in Boston. Anyone familiar with her work, however, need not worry about a lackluster performance.
“Rule number two is I need you to put your hands up, shake your fingers out, sexily bring them down our bodies,” she continued. “I need you guys to give yourselves the permission to have the best night of your lives.”
Indisputably entertaining and naturally charismatic, Wolf has mastered her energetic yet laissez-faire delivery in just under a year of touring. Originally released in 2021, with a deluxe version hot on its tails this past June, her debut album “Juno” transcends genre barriers as she pulls from indie pop, jazz, disco, and punk influences to formulate the unique sound that has propelled her to stardom.
Appropriately decked in an oversized Harvard T-shirt from The Harvard Bookstore and pajama pants, Wolf put the bedroom in bedroom pop, gallivanting across her whimsical stage design and weaving around massive flowers, a couch, a flowery tree, and various band members during her performance. Movement was the name of the game — she lept, danced, and cartwheeled her way to the tempo of the flashing lights and wasn’t stopping there. Tuned into the needs of her listeners, Wolf’s roaming even took her off stage to respond to an urgent call to action: a sign in the crowd that read, “Remi, sign my tits?”
Ever shameless, Wolf wasn’t afraid to indulge in the colorfulness of her lyrics. “How many of you go ‘Aw, fuck, I’m a little mean,’” she asked ahead of an impassioned performance of “Sexy Villain.” With her speech and giddy performance, she vitalized the crowd; “How many of you say to yourself, ‘Man, I am a cunty ass motherfucker?’”
In what is rapidly becoming a tour tradition, Wolf invited her drummer, Conor Malloy, to take over the vocals while Wolf relegated herself to playing drums. Malloy led fans in a call-and-response series of affirmations, which began with the financial wisdom “I will make my credit card payment” and culminated into an echo chamber of the self-confidence mantra “It’s a Dua Lipa summer! It’s a Dua Lipa fall! I am Dua Lipa!”
While Wolf certainly excelled in her crowd work, her musicality was where she truly shone. Her raw talent was bellied by a healthy self-awareness and vulnerability that facilitated her audience engagement. Monologuing before “Liquor Store,” the opening track from “Juno,” Wolf spoke about the uncertainty that stems from a “situationship where this person hasn’t replied to your text in, like, six hours, and you start to get a little — or a lot — anxious.” That anxiety propelled a dynamic performance and brought a new edge to the line “'Cause you like having sex like an animal / And I keep thinking you're running away from me.”
As she serenaded the audience with good energy, fans danced and laughed under strings of bubbles and psychedelic projections. While Remi Wolf is able to convey artistry and talent, her concert was made for fans to have genuine fun.

Literature provides a way to explore and celebrate what makes us unique. Gabrielle Zevin ’00, author and former Leverett House resident, uses her work to deftly navigate the mysterious topic of identity.
Zevin deeply understands the role that individual identity and childhood influence play in defining a person’s outlook. The idea of embracing one’s inherent identity is especially apparent in Zevin’s latest New York Times best-selling novel, “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.” In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Zevin commented on how identity shaped both the origins of her writing and the characters in the novel.
“The fact that I am, like Sam in the book, half Jewish and half Korean, and I always lived in places where there weren't a lot of people like me, I think there's an extent to which that sets you as an outsider among other people, which probably puts you in a sort of a writerly mode just from from the jump,” she said.
Zevin has always wanted to be a writer; the desire wasn’t inspired by a specific moment in her past.
Embracing underrepresented identities such as Sam’s has been key to Zevin's writing even before the release of “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow.” Another of her best-selling novels, “The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry,” focused on a Southeast Asian protagonist at a time in which such narratives were less popular in Western media.
“[A.J. Fikry] ended up exceeding even my expectations for what it would sell at the time,” Zevin said. “And when that book came out, about seven years ago now, people were less interested in stories that had biracial, Southeast Asian leads than they are now.”
This focus on diverse identities and narratives is a large part of why Zevin originally began writing.
“I used to believe more in the idea that novels can be a vehicle for social change,” she said. “I don't really believe that anymore. But what I do believe is that a novel can show: Here's a person, like you or unlike you, and can tell you what it is like to be somebody who is not you. I think there's something great about that.”
Another recurring theme in Zevin’s work is the fear of declining health and human mortality. Zevin commented on the origins of this theme.
“I think that, as humans, we like to think that it is not an inevitability that we get old and our bodies fail,” she said. “There's some fiction that lives in denial of this fact. And I think some people read for that; they read for the denial of death. But I don't think it's a healthy way to go through life.”
“Health is chance in many ways, and also the decline of health is inevitable. So I think that's the thing that becomes part of [Sadie and Sam’s] games,” she continued. “And I think, in many ways, one of the reasons people play games is to deny death.”
Zevin also spoke on her college years and how they shaped her attitudes towards the writing process. Her time at Harvard was unconventional, and she often felt very different from her fellow students.
“I think I was a pretty lousy Harvard student,” Zevin said. “I wasn't a joiner.”
Instead, Zevin recalls that she used her time in college to take in the world around her. Although there is often a feeling that students must contribute as much to the Harvard community as they receive, Zevin found this pressure unnecessary.
“One of the things I learned while I was at Harvard was to not be afraid of periods of dormancy or inactivity,” Zevin said. “Certainly as part of the creative process, the times to observe, the times to be quiet, and the times to kind of just be in the world are just as useful as the times when you're really, really, actively doing something.”
She explained that taking things slow in life is more valuable than many believe.
“There's a part in ‘Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow’ that mentions the German word ‘torschlusspanik,’ meaning ‘gate shut panic,’” she said. “And that's something I definitely felt up to a couple of years ago: This feeling that time is running out and they're going to close the gates behind you.”
“But there are some things, like writing novels, that take years, and getting used to the fact that there are slow things in life was difficult for me,” she continued. “Now I love that, I love the fact that in a world where everything is, you know, TikToks, there are certain things that take a long time and that you have to look at, day after day after day.”
This ability to take things slow has obviously generated great results for Zevin. “Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” is her tenth novel, and her success has only soared after its release. Her focus on exploring intriguing identities, profound questions surrounding health and chance, and an idiosyncratic writing process have made her a standout voice in the contemporary literary world.

Warning: This article contains mention of sexual abuse.
Just as the whole is less than the sum of its parts, memoirs are often less a story of one individual person but rather a collection of friends, mentors, and family that shapes that person’s life.
While many may read Jesse Leon’s ‘01 memoir ‘I’m Not Broken’ as the story of one person tackling the immense adversity of his life, Leon ultimately offers a much different perspective, reminding readers to express gratitude for the impact of community support on their lives.
Growing up in a Mexican barrio in San Diego in the 1980’s, Leon describes a simple early life of helping his mom with household chores and cooking. As these interests adhered to the stereotypically female roles of a Mexican household, Leon experienced bullying from his older brother and father early on in his childhood. “I’m Not Broken” begins by following a young Leon as these problems at home coalesce with racist comments at school and ongoing sexual abuse. The result is a combination capable of breaking even the strongest of wills.
This book may be hard for readers to digest. Leon first describes the difficulty in expressing his sexuality to a father that leans heavily into a culture of machismo, frequently making fun of Leon for not demonstrating many of what he believes to be the qualities of manhood. He then reflects on his sexual assault at age twelve, explaining how a trip to buy water balloons at a local corner store turned into a chilling encounter. Leon describes the dehumanizing experience of his multiple-year involvement in a system of sexual abuse, even receiving death threats against speaking out.
It is with unfathomable courage that Leon so openly shares this experience with readers. And while Leon explains that it took him years to self-identify as a victim, the impact of the sexual violence was immediate: “Everything about me, everything about little nerdy Jesse was going to change. Never again would I let anyone see the fear or the sadness that I felt inside. From that night on, I would hide and protect that scared little boy. I resolved never to be hurt like that again.”
The first half of Leon’s memoir follows this narrative of derailment at a startlingly exponential pace, as these troubles at home coupled with racist comments at school and sexual abuse snowballed into something worse: drinking and doing drugs at school, physically fighting classmates, and lashing out at his mom.
And while most high schoolers spend their time writing their name on their college applications, Leon worked as a sex worker, losing his name and sense of self: “I played the roles I needed to play. I was Carlos, Jose, Tony, Xavier, Adrian, Robbie, Mugeul, or any other name that would come to mind…To lose my name was to lose myself…I was a sex worker — used to being objectified with no human value other than sex.”
Sixteen-year-old Leon leaned on the crutches of drugs, alcohol, and violence to live through these traumas. And there’s a sense of frustration and situational irony while reading Leon’s memoir, as so many people in Leon’s life can’t see his internal dialogue of mental illness and struggle. But finally, much to the relief of both Leon and the reader, while many seemed to normalize and overlook his behavior as that of another troubled teenager, a few people take notice — resetting Leon’s life.
A school counselor places Leon in a program to finish high school on time. A San Diego State University student looking to recruit Latino high school students introduces Leon to the possibility of a college education. A girlfriend convinces Leon to attend Narcotics Anonymous, where Leon would meet his sponsor.
With each new person in Leon’s life, the reader gains another life lesson, another pivotal piece of advice that guides Leon. And while some memoirs read as a personal reflection with little regard to an audience, it seems that Leon so openly shares these intimate moments in his life with a sense of altruism, gifting the reader these same life lessons that redirected his own life.
Out of all of the lessons and quotes from important people in Leon’s life, one of the most touching comments came from Leon’s NA sponsor. After Leon comes out to his sponsor as gay, his sponsor immediately responds, “‘I love you exactly for you who are. Remember, Jess, people who judge don’t matter, and people who matter don’t judge.’” Leon uses his writing to pay homage to the impact of these angels throughout his life, commenting on the collective power of community to shape the individual.
After writing his UC Berkeley college thesis on the HIV crisis in prisons, a mentor encouraged Leon to apply to graduate school at Harvard. It wasn’t until Leon came to Harvard, however, that he realized the bittersweet nature of becoming a success story: that when radiating personal triumph, the importance of mentors and friends can be reduced to shadows. “I learned there that being the success story comes with both a benefit and a curse,” he writes. “Sometimes people interpret my success as that of an individual who pulled himself up by his own bootstraps, as opposed to my success being the product of a network, of the efforts of many people, some of them total strangers and at different touch points in my life, who made sure I did not fail. For me, there were no bootstraps.”
By offering this quote at the end of his memoir, Leon reminds readers to think of a higher power in life that leads to these often random, yet pivotal relationships as a gift to move forward. A skim of this book will provide readers with one life story: the unbelievably rocky, yet victorious life of Jesse Leon. A deeper read, however, will reveal that dozens of important characters shaped the course of Leon’s life.

Rarely does a dance render a costume, let alone a plain white sheet of fabric, to be the focal point of the performance, but “HUSK/VESSEL” — a multimedia project by Boston’s KAIROS Dance Theater — isn’t a traditional dance. A collaboration between choreographer Paula Josa-Jones and KAIROS co-founder and executive artistic director DeAnna Pellecchia that premiered on Oct. 14, “HUSK/VESSEL” explored how costume can function as both covering and habitat. Although the performers’ impressive displays of energy were interspersed with longer stretches of choreography that lacked momentum, KAIROS Dance Theater’s narrative exploration of costume in dance was ultimately one to remember.
Over the course of its 45-minute run time, “HUSK/VESSEL” evolved from group performance to solo features to duets. Each dancer inhabited and embodied their own fabric, at times weaponizing it to ensnare another dancer. The overall tempo of the piece felt slow, not just in terms of run time but also in the movement arc of the dancers. One section, for example, involved a gradual, collective migration from one corner of the stage to another during which dancers would trepidatiously transition through weight changes and pilatic positions. Isolated choreography, however, from head snaps to chaotic falls and trips over sheets, was well executed at the fast speed needed to convey the sense of urgency.
Some of the slower sections in “HUSK/VESSEL” seemed to drag on too long. However, the controlled plies and oxymoronic slow kicks generated inertia that sustained the progression of the choreography. In fact, what “HUSK/VESSEL” excelled at was the telling of a story purely through physical language. The vignettes of solo and duet performances involved a manipulation of the white sheets to create landscape and setting. One solo feature, for example, involved a dancer struggling to crawl out of their sheet, evocative of a nightmare manifested. Another vignette saw two dancers use their sheets as a means of entrapment — an attachment that was portrayed with force and aggression.
Rehearsing in makeup and costume marks the near completion of a dance piece’s development, from first learning choreography to finally performing. However, the white sheets dancers donned for the performance weren’t just accessories but extensions of the body. “HUSK/VESSEL” was developed and rehearsed entirely during the pandemic, which added another dimension to the meaning of the costume — an additional degree of separation between each dancer. The dancers' control of the sheets, or lack thereof, blurred the line between prop and costume. Different stages of the dance saw different usages of the sheets, from embellishing the dancers’ movements to restricting them. And although there was not a resounding conclusion to what exactly the function of the costume was, all forms of sheet choreography created exciting and unpredictable tension throughout the performance.
The motion of the sheets, coupled with lighting design that gave the stage and the reptilian leotards worn by the dancers a bronze glow, created strong nautical sound-imagery. The nature motif persisted with the raw, hunter-gatherer-esque interactions between dancers and between each individual and their sheet. The performance ended with the dancers standing in a line, backs turned to the audience, their sheets draped around them like a covering for warmth or protection. Walking upstage towards the illuminated backdrop, the defined singularity of each dancer became more pronounced, yet the synchronization of their steps created a sense of unity. “HUSK/VESSEL” depicted a return to human beings’ most primitive, vulnerable state, where all we have is our body and our coverings. Grappling with exposure and safety, “HUSK/VESSEL” leaves one wondering about how our own outer layers define who we are.

As children, many wish they could walk into a painting like Mary Poppins into the world of street chalk, or follow the scribbles of Harold’s Purple Crayon. Since there is not yet a portal into these worlds, the next best thing has begun: immersive art exhibitions.
Walking into these exhibitions — likely housed in an old warehouse — the ceiling lights shut off and the surrounding walls are illuminated with famous artwork like Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” or the Sistine Chapel. Why not turn van Gogh, Monet, and Kahlo into a sort of Walt Disney world with interactive playgrounds made from their art? Perhaps even with a Zuckerbergian Metaverse spin? These multisensory, immersive experiences based on any given artists’ original work loom larger than life.
The premier of Immersive van Gogh, in particular, spread like wildfire, much like any “cool find” on TikTok. In 2020, Netflix released an episode of the hit show “Emily in Paris,” featuring a bright-eyed Emily wandering through the original Parisian Immersive van Gogh exhibit. It was a perfect idea for the (somewhat) post-pandemic, impatient lifestyle: exciting, fast-paced, and with lots and lots of screens.
After Immersive van Gogh made its successful debut in Paris, the medium turned its attention toward exhibiting in American metropolises. The grandness and perpetual stimulation feel appropriately American, especially for American children (a generation of “iPad kids”) or adults who find the art world inaccessible due to its ties with wealth and elite education. Immersive art exhibits do succeed in bringing the infamous and unattainable closer to audiences that would have to board a plane to experience the art. But this point is caveated, however, by the exhibitions’ exclusive location in big cities.
A major draw of these shows becomes clear after watching “Emily in Paris” or scrolling through social media. These immersive shows are aesthetically stunning. On Instagram, they convey an image of a person who is not only fun and artsy, but cultured. Undeniably, a huge part of Immersive van Gogh’s success was the appeal to teens and young adults who love a colorful and flashy post up on their feed.
This trend of immersive art is not confined to contemporary generations, either. A Shakespeare play at the Globe theater or a choir singing in a Medieval gothic church have historically had a similar, although analogue, immersive effect to these exhibits. More recent examples include the works of the contemporary artist Yayoi Kusama or those featured in Venice’s Biennale that require viewers to walk through a physical space to experience their art on a multidimensional level.
Of course, seeing an original Kusama installation is entirely different than seeing a recreation of Frida Kahlo, but when attending Immersive Frida Kahlo, it is the original work of Massimiliano Siccardi, who was also the artist behind Immersive van Gogh, Klimt, and Monet & The Impressionists. Siccardi is well-established in the art world, having studied dance and winning awards for his photography and scenography over the course of thirty years. As the mastermind behind these installations, Siccardi has asserted himself in a monopoly of the grandiose digital art world, his reach spanning continents and genres.
These artists at the heart of the immersive exhibitions, many of them long dead, could have never envisioned this digital era twist on their works. What they did with oil paints, a brush, and canvas can now be revitalized by Siccardi and other digital artists. In order to use this art, they certainly had to jump over hurdles with copyright laws, but so did artists like Warhol. In 1984, Warhol altered Lynn Goldsmith’s portrait of Prince for a Vanity Fair piece, after which a series of debates on his right to do so ensued. Warhol argued that his interpretation changed the meaning of the photo, giving it new life, as the animated interpretations of these impressionists claim to do. Siccardi and Warhol perhaps upcycle others’ art to an extreme extent, but most artists create with a grasp of their time and the art that came before them.
Impressionism came out of Romanticism, which took spins on works from ancient Greece. A totally new and contemporary genre actually situating itself in a canon of Western art. Immersive exhibit artists are now harnessing what they learn from the art before them with digital tools, perhaps similarly to how Romans copied exact Greek sculptures using more modern tools. Should these Roman sculptures face the same contestation as immersive exhibits?
Perhaps then, a crux of the issue lies not only in catering to a social media-centric generation, but that in using this famous art, digital artists strip the original art of its “aura.” In one of his most influential essays, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” 20th century aesthetic and social philosopher Walter Benjamin defines aura as “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction.” Ancient Roman art, copied or original, therefore has an aura that Siccardi’s “mechanical reproductions” of impressionist work do not. The original art he shows does not retain its “aura,” while for Kusama, walking across her mirrored floors is experiencing her art in its most fruitful, not withering, form.
When going to Immersive van Gogh, you are not going to see a collection of van Gogh’s greatest works, you are going to see a digital interpretation of van Gogh, which may or may not matter to the audience that would rather spend $40 to see van Gogh animated in a Tribeca warehouse than $25 to see the real thing at the MET.

“An act of hospitality can only be poetic," J. Derrida once said.
The above quote certainly rings true after viewing the Enigma Chamber Opera’s production of Benjamin Britten’s 1963 “The Prodigal Son,” staged and directed by Kirsten Cairns, which proved to be one of the great triumphs of the local art scene. Based on the Biblical tale of the same name, the libretto by William Plomer tells the familiar story of a father’s forgiveness and a son’s redemption.
“The Prodigal Son” — performed live on Oct. 21 and 22 at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston — is one of three of Britten’s works intended for church performance. Cairns and the performers took full advantage of the cathedral setting, lending the performance a warmth and sense of hospitality that would likely have been sterilized had it taken place at a typical concert hall.
Paul Marr, who directed the lighting design, took particular care in utilizing the space: The performance was bathed with blue light, giving the work a quality of oneiric placelessness which proved a brilliantly heady counterpoint to the warmth and embodiedness of the performance proper. The color changed subtly and without ceremony throughout the performance, underscoring the atmosphere while never slipping into redundancy or overstaging. The media design, credited to Peter A. Torpey, was similarly effective, providing an impressionistic set of images — rolling fields of wheat in the country scenes, pomegranates during the temptation scenes, a cluster of hands in the city — to complement each scene in a way that was lyrical and nuanced.
The stage design of the drama, however, was far from its only impressive feature. After a brief introductory speech, Cairns invited the audience to speak amongst ourselves as she headed backstage. The performance then began with a striking maneuver: the choir began offstage, giving the impression of a musical force emerging organically and spontaneously out of the audience. The singers approached the stage and bowed to the instrumentalists, who bowed back before taking their seats. This small gesture seems to contain the entire opera within it: a poetic display of the father’s unconditional kindness which Cairns acknowledges as central to the parable.
The instrumentalists provided a near-impeccable complementary force to a choir at once grounded and otherworldly, led brilliantly by Edward Elwin Jones. Jones, doubling as conductor and keyboardist, brought the best out of Britten’s organ score.
Trumpeter Ryan Noe displayed an impressive stylistic fluidity, equally eloquent in the quasi-Baroque idiom of the countryside music — phrasing that requires the humble incisiveness of a religious cantor — as in the muscularity and edge demanded in the modernism of the city scenes. Hornist Emma Staudacher was a notable strength here too, invoking the power and imagery of a Shostakovich symphony in her playing before returning to the meeker dynamics demanded of her role in the countryside scenes in an impressive display of technical control.
Percussionist Mike Williams was strong from the first note, and string players Emily Rome (viola) and Daniel Gorn (double bass) provided the vitality of a full orchestra when needed as well as an operatic, oratory charm in their solos. Harpist Angelina Savoia’s gestures filled the church with a fragrance well-suited to each scene.
Perhaps the most impressive was Aimee Toner, who danced around the alto flute solo with a balletic virtuosity and ease — not an easy task given Britten’s Herculean demands of breath control — and, with a beautifully breathy tone on the flute, inflected the entire performance with a beguiling primordial quality much appropriate to the diegesis.
The vocal corps was as well without a weak link. From the beginning, the chorus, composed of Thomas Oesterling, Paul Soper, and Daniel Fridley, was a miraculous force of flawless diction and intonation.
Omar Najmi, who approached the role of the Tempter with a near sensuality, expertly juxtaposed the innocence of Matthew DiBattista’s tenor as The Younger Son. DiBattista’s singing possessed a brightness and purity of tone which at times recalled a golden-period Richard Tucker. He proved equally formidable as an actor as he did a singer, performing the tepidness of the country scenes and the arrogance demanded of the Tempter in the city with incredible subtlety.
Aaron Engebreth’s breadth of tone proved at once boldfaced and understated. David McFerrin enveloped his perfect diction in the role of the Elder Son with a tone reminiscent of honey — as flexible and easy as it was warm-colored and penetrating.
The play between the divine perfection of the choral singing and the informality of the staging and costume design, executed by Cairns and Rebecca Shannon Butler respectively, allowed Cairns’s thesis — that each of us hold divinity in our ability to love and forgive — to reverberate throughout the work, imbuing it with contemporary, humanist relevance.
All in all, the performance was a decisive success.

Sharbendu De is nothing like his photographic inspirations. Now, he even thinks they are problematic. Among them are some of the world’s most historic documentary photographers: Steve McCurry, Raghu Rai, and Sebastião Salgado — artists who turned their lenses toward non-Western narratives.
“What I am trying to call out is this colonial culture of looking at our countries as a premodern, pre-industrialized nation,” De said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
According to De, the world needs to alter its visual vocabulary and the way it looks at photography. Luckily, change is nothing new to him. Growing up in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, De vividly remembers the horrors of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
“My mom and dad were still there, and I had no news if they were alive or not,” he recalled.
It was only once his father reached a satellite phone and reached his son that he knew they had survived. Since that moment, he has experienced six more natural disasters. “That was a tipping point,” he recalled, after which he knew he needed to work on the subject of climate change.
Potentially his most intimate artistic response to natural disaster is his project “Between Grief and Nothing,” where he highlights the chronically undocumented mental health impacts of natural disasters. “Are you going to Nepal?” he recalled his friend asking when, in April 2015, the nation suffered a devastating earthquake that killed roughly 9,000 people. But De didn’t want to cover it like he knew all of the other photographers he arrived alongside would.
“The world is tired of looking at the same kind of imagery of destruction,” he asserted.
Instead, he chose to paint, over a longer period of time than is typical for most short-stay photojournalists, a picture of the nightmarish reality of survivors of disaster. Heavily saturated and littered with deep reds and oranges, “Between Grief and Nothing”’s dark images transport the viewer into the mind of someone experiencing this trauma that De himself knows all too well. He refers to the phenomenon as “mental violence.”
image id=1359386 align=center size=large caption=true
While he was in Nepal, De was constantly thinking of his own evacuation plan — constantly asking himself which roof he would jump to in case of emergency. These mental terrors, which De initially only imagined being the subject of his art, became an inescapable reality of his own life, inevitably bleeding into his art.
By working on numerous projects over his long career, De has refined a style that borrows as much from cinema as it does conventional photography. Antithetical to the “decisive moment” philosophy employed by many of the world’s documentary photographers, nearly every inch of De’s latest works is manufactured. From lights to paid actors to a behind-the-scenes crew, his works are carefully calculated to perfectly depict the imagined realities he attempts to articulate.
In his most recent project, “An Elegy for Ecology,” his divergent style comes to a head. Imagining a future where the unchecked destruction of climate change restricts access to breathable air, future humans are depicted indoors, connected to oxygen tanks, and surrounded by plants and animals that remind them of the world they destroyed. Still, the project isn’t fantasy; it is De’s projection of a plausible reality if humans don’t change their ways.
According to De, the images are meant to be esoteric, attempting to make the careful observer rethink their values regarding the climate.
“Why do I have to make everything so simple?” he questioned. “The writing is screaming loudly from the wall. Everything's coming to an end. And we are busy with where to go for a drink tonight and what movies we watch.”
By forcing his viewers not just to ponder climatic issues but also how they think about them — a potentially more pressing problem — De’s art is a marked departure from other depictions of disaster which have become all too familiar. In this way, his art serves to reverse the complacency humans feel about the planet by the most unlikely means.
As a 2022 Visiting Artist Fellow with the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, he is currently exhibiting a small body of images from his project “Imagined Homeland,” which aims to highlight Arunachal Pradesh’s remote Lisu people, a Tibeto-Burman indigenous group, and their unadulterated bond with nature. The project, which took De seven years to finish, employs many of the same artistic elements that he utilized in “Between Grief and Nothing,” most notably heavily scripting in natural environments.
Critically, however, De maintained that his work is an “interpretive statement,” or a reflection of his own beliefs regarding the issues at hand, rather than what he coins the “colonial-paternalistic gaze” which so many photographers have used to attain global stardom.
Over 18 years of refining his artistic style, De has evolved his own art to serve humanity’s most pressing needs. Although his inspirations, who were most active in the latter half of the 20th century, helped make documentary photography a universal means of understanding and empathizing with the world, De has reached the height of his artistic influence in a very different time. Now, as humanity faces a collective challenge of unprecedented magnitude, it has outgrown the need for only sympathy and worldliness. Instead, it requires of its 21st-century artists a new means of catalyzing the gravity of every action. The language of art is changing, and Sharbendu De is at the forefront of an evolution.

Matthew Quick’s “We Are The Light” follows the town of Majestic, PA through the eyes of an uneasy man at the center of tragedy, Lucas Goodgame. Following a mass shooting at the town’s theater, the town must either band together to heal or let itself be torn apart. Quick’s perspective on the human condition at its most vulnerable could have easily degraded hope rather than emboldened it. Luckily, with an impressive publication list, including the Oscar-winning film adaptation of his previous work “The Silver Linings Playbook,” Quick is no stranger to unpacking difficult emotions and relaying them beautifully in text. “We Are The Light” tugs at heartstrings, but keeps readers engaged with unique prose, impressive character portrayals, and honest human fallibility.
The structure and style of “We Are The Light” deserves attention because of Quick’s unique approach to relaying the all-too-common story of small town heartbreak and mass shootings. Rather than present the story in a linear fashion, Quick narrates the entirety of the story through the rambling letters of Lucas to his Jungian analyst Karl Johnson. Lucas is a former high school school counselor, now out of work following the recent tragedy. The people of Majestic see Lucas as the hero who saved lives, while at the same time, he only sees himself as a heartbroken monster. With the support of his wife Darcy in angelic form and the guidance of Karl, Lucas attempts to grapple with intense grief, depression, hallucination, and paranoia.
Perfectly capturing the maze of human emotions and triggers to bygone traumas, Lucas’s letters to Karl, which comprise the novel, slowly reveal the nature of his own neuroses and the town’s tragedy. By forcing the reader to tease apart the story piece by piece and retroactively connect the dots, Quick encourages cathartic personal reflection. In the foreword of the book, Quick speaks about the goal of “We Are The Light;” he aims to show that even in life’s darkest moments, we are capable of love and forging human connection, and that regardless of the content of our character, we will fail. His imperative is that people simply cannot let failures color their lives. With the simple act of forcing contemplation through creative storytelling, the letters of Lucas Goodgame quickly transform from mere marks on a page into the intimate portrayal of someone looking for love and help.
Through this winding and weaving through the psyche of a broken man, Quick uses Lucas to demonstrate the faults human beings necessarily possess, revealing that we are not perfect people with the ability to quickly overcome tragedy. Quick’s selection of a mass shooting at a beloved small-town cinema was an appropriate — albeit incredibly difficult — topic to explore this side of human nature. With increases in mass shootings around the U.S. at ever increasing rates, addressing the issue of healing following the events is highly relevant.
In Quick’s eyes, a powerful way to deal with tragedy is through the therapeutic nature of art. The kind of story Quick presents serves an integral role in helping to heal not just the fictional wounds of the characters, but the very real wounds in shared communities around the world. The characters themselves mourn in many disparate ways, but their catharsis is art, making a movie as a community to reclaim the space at the theater stolen by a broken man.
The characters of “We Are The Light” fight to find a balance in the dichotomy of hope and hopelessness. As a deeply broken man himself, Lucas is, in many ways, the perfect protagonist for a story focused on the idea of human imperfection. He himself saves many lives the night of the disaster, but still loses his wife and even forgets to take care of himself. All of the characters, whether survivors or victims, have names, stories, and now forever-changed lives of which the reader only glimpses in the 18 letters which comprise this novel. In these perfectly imperfect glimpses into the complexities of human existence at the time of tragedy, Quick shows the glimmers of hope that are always present, however small they may be. This clash between an outward projection of hope and an inward sense of hopelessness is the precarious balance “We Are The Light” masterfully tells throughout its story.
“We Are The Light” is a difficult book to read because of its subject matter, but Matthew Quick uses that discomfort to push for contemplation in his readers. “We Are The Light” is well worth the read as the perfect example of the shared human condition today. Quick’s message is simple at its center: We encounter hardship, but it is imperative that we strive to “make meaning out of that pain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure. The very cave you are afraid to enter turns out to be the source of what you are looking for.” —Joseph Campbell
The recording of my interview with Nick Ige ’25 and Kevin Fischetto ’26 begins with boisterous laughs and ends the same way, my questions broken by the occasional joke and always met with smiles. But those close to Nick and Kevin are familiar with the unmistakable seriousness about them — a sobriety betraying their lengthy journeys to find peace, as well as their unfathomable ambition.
The two met during Kevin’s stay at Harvard during Visitas last April, yet it wasn’t until this semester that the pair — both avid surfers and hikers — discovered their shared passion for taking on adventures in the outdoors.
“It’s one of those things that you can’t really put a finger on — the power of nature. It forces you to be present. And doing that with friends…” Kevin trailed off, shrugging and letting slip a small smile.
In early October of this year, a plan for their next adventure was hatched — one that few people have ever dreamt of and even fewer have achieved.
Nick and Kevin first elected to summit Tanzania’s Mount Kilimanjaro over this coming winter break. But the two decided that the highest free-standing mountain in the world wouldn’t be enough. Over the course of the following year and a half, Nick and Kevin will attempt to climb not just one mountain but seven, and not just any seven but the tallest on each continent — the famed Seven Summits. The challenge totals more than 130,000 feet of elevation. Only roughly 350 people have ever succeeded.
The task ahead of them is large in every sense of the word, but it almost pales in comparison to their journeys so far. Perhaps no pair of friends is better prepared, or more driven, to take it on.
* * *
Sadness and loneliness are around me
They feel like old friends
There is an anger inside raging like the sea
I just want to hold her and love her till the end
—Nick Ige ’25
More is at stake in this quest than one would expect.
Alongside admission to Harvard, where Nick and Kevin are pursuing degrees in Neuroscience and Integrative Biology, respectively, the two lay claim to 16 combined years of military service and creation of the nonprofit “Dagger and Book.” Nick and Kevin aim to use their upcoming expedition to promote discussion about attending college among their fellow veterans, many of whom opt against pursuing secondary education for a variety of reasons, including lack of time and fear of not fitting in.
“I don’t really feel much older because of how awesome you guys are,” Kevin said, referencing other college students. “There’s a real value there, but people just don’t know.”
“Going to college is generally going to make your life better,” Nick added. “It’s going to force you to expand your thoughts. It’s going to force you to interact with people you don’t normally interact with.”
The two have Harvard to thank for meeting one another. But Harvard can only do so much to help students manage the “spicy feels,” as Nick referred to them, maintaining our conversation’s buoyancy while drifting into decidedly darker territory. This project is also very much about raising awareness for mental health. Nick shared his own grapple with depression, candidly recounting to me the feeling of holding an empty gun to his head while on deployment. The two believe that everyone can empathize with these kinds of emotions, regardless of experience.
“The hardest thing you’ve gone through is the hardest thing you’ve gone through,” Kevin said. “I don’t think you can marginalize one’s struggle. It could be anything.”
There is no one method of dealing with the feelings Nick and Kevin describe. Perhaps the answer sits among the clouds, awaiting those who dare to endure struggle, setback, and the elements together.
“Everyone’s suffered through depression and anxiety at some point in their life,” Nick said. “Coming back from deployment, friendship and adventure is what helped pull me out of that.”
* * *
“You cannot stay on the summit forever; you have to come down again. So why bother in the first place? Just this: What is above knows what is below, but what is below does not know what is above. One climbs, one sees. One descends, one sees no longer, but one has seen. There is an art of conducting oneself in the lower regions by the memory of what one saw higher up.” —René Daumal, “Mount Analogue”
There isn’t a better metaphor in the world for overcoming obstacles and ascending from melancholic depths than climbing a mountain. Or seven of them.
“We want to learn from higher; we want to take away from the perspectives we gain while climbing,” Kevin said. “I think it would make us better human beings in the lower regions by suffering higher up — going through struggles with friends.”
While conquering the Seven Summits alone is not sufficient for accomplishing their goals, it’s another piece of the puzzle — a means of mobilizing what they’ve learned and sending a message.
“If two fucking dumbass SOF (Special Operations Forces) vets can do it — find each other, do this grand adventure together — then anybody can go do any adventure with their friends,” Nick said with a grin.
Everyone benefits from a risky undertaking. Climbing Kilimanjaro, however, let alone Kosciuszko, Puncak Jaya, Vinson, Denali, Aconcagua, and Everest, might prove too demanding for most people. But most people aren’t former Army Rangers or Air Force Special Reconnaissance Operators, either.
* * *
“I have never seen a wild thing feel sorry for itself. A little bird will fall dead, frozen from a bough, without ever having felt sorry for itself.” —D.H. Lawrence
Much work awaits Nick and Kevin. Traveling the globe and acquiring adequate gear is as cheap as running more than 40 miles a week in preparation is easy, especially when you have class to attend afterwards. But if the fact that Nick and Kevin take consolation in the above quote says anything, it’s that nothing will get in their way.
“We believe in setting wild goals and working as hard as we can to achieve them,” Nick said over text.
For now, the pair will continue to fundraise and train before tackling Kilimanjaro and Kosciuszko this winter. You can support them by contributing to their GoFundMe or following Nick, Kevin, and their nonprofit on Instagram.
Harvard’s winter recess begins on December 18th. By the time exam period is over, Nick and Kevin will have touched down in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — 7,500 miles away from campus.
* * *
“For out of this tribulation there comes a peace, deep in the soul and surer than any dream…” —Alan Paton, “I Hold the Bandages and Ointments Ready”
Nick and I met on the club rugby team last fall. He introduced me to Kevin and their momentous aspirations only recently, but in the short time I’ve been involved with their work, the two have made unbelievable progress.
I firmly believe that this story about dedication and bravery deserves to be elevated in the Harvard community. The paths that brought them here and the path they intend to forge together are nothing short of legend — a modern Hero’s Journey. I also believe that the works this journey produces should be shared. Nick and Kevin recognize the value of introspection and original writing, creative or otherwise.
As such, this article represents only the first in a series. The “Dagger and Book” column will continue into the spring and hopefully beyond, documenting the process through a collage of quotes we find inspiring, journal entries, photos, and the occasional poem. I look forward to accompanying Nick and Kevin to summit Australia’s Mount Kosciuszko in January to provide some reflections of my own.
Until then, I ask that you support the two friends at the links above and make the most of what Harvard has to offer, as Nick and Kevin do: finding strength in each other and heeding the call to adventure.
When you reach the peak of the mountain, says the poet Kahlil Gibran, only “then you shall begin to climb.”
—Staff writer Charles W. McCormick can be reached at charles.mccormick@thecrimson.com. His column “Dagger and Book” explores the artistic experience of Nick and Kevin’s mountain climbing adventure.

In their decades-long history, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players have brought their audiences to all the corners of the United Kingdom and across half of the globe. This time is no different: From Nov. 10 to Nov. 13, they are transforming the stage of the Agassiz Theater into the Palace of Westminster and its environs in their production of “Iolanthe.”
“Iolanthe” is the story of a young shepherd, Strephon, who wants to marry Phyllis, a ward of the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. Phyllis does not know that Strephon is half-fairy, and when she sees Strephon kissing a seemingly young woman, she assumes the worst. But her “rival” turns out to be none other than Strephon’s own mother, Iolanthe, who is an eternally young fairy. Phyllis turns to her other suitors — who include half of the House of Lords and her own guardian — leading to a conflict between the peers and the fairies.
The show is as much a love story as a witty satire of Victorian-era law, society, and government, but “Iolanthe”’s main strength might be its music.
“There are a lot of references in the score to contemporaries and predecessors of Sullivan as a composer, including Wagner, Verdi and Bellini, and I'm excited to channel the spirits of those composers in the music,” said music director Arhan Kumar ’23.
“[It’s] some of the best music that Gilbert and Sullivan ever wrote,” said creative director Dora Woodruff ’24.
Kumar, whose own artistic background is in opera singing, pointed toward the vocals as one of “Iolanthe”’s highlights.

“I'm really excited about the robust singing that everyone is bringing to the stage. It isn't an easy thing, especially for undergraduates who may or may not have extensive training in singing to really wrestle with a 25 piece orchestra,” Kumar said.
The mention of the orchestra is crucial, as G&S is one of the few performing arts organizations on campus devoted equally to acting and music. “We have a full wind section … brass instruments, string section,” Woodruff said. “It’s a legitimate orchestra.”
Although G&S rose up to the challenge of adapting “Iolanthe,” some changes — primarily stemming from a concern about the length — had to be made to bring it to a Harvard audience.
“It's a show that has some really beautiful music [but] it's also a show that can be light on plot sometimes,” said stage director Nicholas C. Fahy ’23. “We wanted to make sure that when our audience comes into and out of the theater, they feel like [we] use the right amount of words to deliver the right amount of content.”
Still, the largest source of problems was not “Iolanthe”’s libretto or score, but rather the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the group continued performing during the Covid-19 pandemic and after, it did so with a markedly different repertoire — including Sullivan’s solo one-act opera “Cox and Box,” and the original “Milkmaid” — and on a smaller scale.
“I think that coming out of the Covid pandemic, a lot of student organizations like Gilbert and Sullivan don't have the membership that they used to,” Fahy said. “That's just created this vacuum of institutional knowledge: Who are the people who can do costumes? And who are the people who know how to do props? And different things like that.”
But the group wasn’t caught unawares, and, in anticipation of the difficulties of the ambitious task, began preparing all the way back in the spring.
“I think we had a good roadmap that we wanted to follow by the time August came,” Kumar said.
Although, as executive producer Lucas J. Walsh ’24 said, there were “a lot of complications,” the production team more than delivered with hand-painted set elements and elaborate costumes.
“I'm just really excited to see it all coalescing, being able to sit down during the production and watch what this incredible team has put together,” Walsh said.
“Iolanthe” is a labor of love, a result of a process that began months before the September casting. Is it worth seeing?
“I think it is,” Kumar said. “It is something that people will not find in other shows.”
“You get to see some of the funniest, best singing people on campus,” Walsh added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a media landscape overrun with sensationalized true crime podcasts, overly-praised murderer biopics, and a six o’clock news lineup that looks more like a stack of police reports than unbiased journalism, can an ethical exploration into the realities of crime exist? While Netflix has a recent track record of controversial depictions of criminology, the docuseries “I Am A Stalker” could be a rare unblemished entry in the streaming service’s spotted crime lineup. The follow-up to the popular series “I Am A Killer” chronicles eight criminal cases, with each episode taking a deep dive into a different incident of convicted stalking. Featuring a broad array of interviewees, all with different relationships to the crime, and an overall understated tone, “I Am A Stalker” at last presents a somewhat respectable option for true crime consumption.
“I Am A Stalker,” as its title suggests, features the perspective of perpetrators of relatively unknown stalking crimes. While this choice of point of view risks deifying a new group of lawbreakers and opening the door for copy-cat cases, the docuseries only spends cursory time on each stalker’s position. Instead, Netflix opts to give more weight to the stories of victims and experts (i.e. criminologists, local police, etc.), making the stalker’s words almost inconsequential — simply pieces of information used to give backstory to the account, rather than to sensationalize or apologize for it. However, even while the perpetrators’ screen time is minimal, the series doesn’t allow for a mystification of their actions. Often, true crime works that don’t heavily feature the offender can be a trap for the martyring of violent lawbreakers. Because an unclear portrait is painted of this person, enthusiasts begin to excuse their crime, often crafting narratives on why this culprit might actually be the “victim” of the situation. However, the stalkers in “I Am A Stalker” seem like typical people, not stars awaiting potential celebrity.
The hardest feat of an ethical crime documentary has always been presenting perspectives in a way that makes even the most sensationalized crime, unsensational. In recent years, this credo, supposedly meant to define the true crime world, has fallen victim to cheap attempts at cash grabs, frights, and the ever-present, “You’ll never believe what happens after the commercial break!” But Netflix’s lack of commercials is not the reason why “I Am A Stalker” reclaims this motto — it’s their plainclothes tactic to make crime media real again. The problem at the core of the true crime genre, even in documentaries, is the fictionalization of real crimes; and with murder and extortion schemes that sometimes sound like the plot of a Martin Scorsese movie, it’s easy to find tantalizing “drama” in events that are all too real. However, “I Am A Stalker” attempts to demolish the mindset of “this fiction could never happen to me” in its use of a bare bones documentary style.
By making its interviews so matter-of-fact and its presentation style so banal, the docuseries highlights the commonality of stalking. Everything from the simple, white intertitles of stalking incident facts to the repetitive staging of the interviews reeks of plainness. The series feels like a run-of-the-mill, everyday documentary, which highlights the fact that stalking is an everyday crime that can not only affect the most “normal” people but can also come from the most common places. Many of the stalkers featured in the show were loved ones or former friends turned to harmful gawkers in a blink. And while this style makes “I Am A Stalker” a boring binge watch, it honors the stories of these victims as something more than a spectacle meant to be gawked at like a based-on-a-true-story horror movie. It adds reality to what has only been melodrama — a much needed addition in the crime documentary genre.

Phoenix are having a renaissance. If the Botticelli painting on the cover of their new album “Alpha Zulu” doesn’t convince you, then their music will. On Nov. 4, the French indie band unveiled a set of sleek pop-rock vignettes straight from the Louvre, which housed a recording studio for the first time in its centuries-long history.
Lead singer Thomas Mars described “Alpha Zulu” as “all over the place” to Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, but the album’s thematic breadth works in its favor. Phoenix place their characteristically crisp songwriting and self-production on full display as they outline topics from the personal to the theological.
On the title track, Mars assumes the perspective of a deity seeking to understand humanity’s obsession with sin. “Tell me why, don’t tell me when, don’t tell me how,” he commands. As if to mock the call-and-response structure of many hymns, the intro’s choral synth phrases are met with only silence in between. Mars’s derisive “ha!” reinforces the belief that “singin’ hallelujah” without genuine repentance amounts to little beyond a way to “cover your lies.” Then, the sparse instrumentals assume a celestial resonance as Mars wonders, “Why choose your body over time with me?”
Some potential reasons — and even more questions — emerge on the next track, “Tonight” (feat. Ezra Koenig), Phoenix’s first studio release to feature guest vocals. Mars’s uptempo duet with the Vampire Weekend frontman reconciles nostalgia and immediacy over a bouncy bass line. “What if I was the answer to your prayer?” Mars asks, dismissing spirituality in pursuit of a connection that might not even “last ‘til it’s dawn.” As the post-chorus’s melismatic call to “roll with me” fragments the bridge among insistent echoes, its nonchalance devolves into a sense of losing control. Mars and Koenig restore order by abandoning their trademark wry wordplay to admit a difficult truth: “Oh, how I wish I could be someone like you.”
Doubt starts to cloud Mars’s wishes on “After Midnight” as he contemplates how even the sky, one of life’s few constants, transforms from day to night. The liminal sunset hours in between are at once “way too much” and “not enough” for Mars, who cynically quips that “‘heavenly’ sort of sounds adolescent.” Sparse guitar chords give the melody room to wander, but the song’s balance shifts in the bridge, when the background whir of synths leaps to form arpeggios above a hypnotizing chant of “Listen, listen, it’s illicit.” Mars then breaks his own spell to warn, “Soon you’ll realize it’s after midnight.” The silence that follows, like midnight, arrives sooner than expected.
“Winter Solstice,” the only “Alpha Zulu” track Phoenix wrote remotely instead of in their Louvre studio, captures the bleak isolation of feeling dispensable to someone essential. “Thank God you know your ways,” Mars sings, a muffled beat blunting the edge of his sarcasm. “What would you trade me for?” The layers of synths closing in on Mars’s voice emphasize his desperation to find “something positive” as the days get shorter.
Album closer “Identical” pays homage to the late producer and DJ Philippe Zdar, who worked on Phoenix’s 2010 Grammy-winning hit “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.” The soundtrack to Sofia Coppola’s film “On the Rocks” featured an alternate cut of the song, and the newly extended version amplifies its searching mood.
“Alpha Zulu” takes its name from a phrase Mars heard a pilot repeat during a patch of in-flight turbulence, and Phoenix wrote “almost all” of it in just 10 days. Though the pandemic prevented the band members from meeting in person for months, their whirlwind creative process propelled them past towering challenges to even greater heights.

Constantly veering left and right, Arctic Monkeys’ “The Car,” released on Oct. 21, masterfully personifies its title but also aimlessly drives for the fun of the ride, and lead singer and lyricist Alex Turner is more than content with that.
Arctic Monkeys is a band that has never been afraid to change it sound completely, venturing into a new style once every few years. Exemplified by the transitions in their earlier days from an almost punk era seen in “Favourite Worst Nightmare,” to the lovesick longing of “Suck it and See,” to practically redefining alternative rock 'n' roll with “AM,” this band is clearly fond of experimentation. Their seventh studio album, “The Car,” falls right into this trend, proving to once again set itself apart from their prior albums in a way that feels more mature than the rest — drawing inspiration from the craft that they have been perfecting over the last fifteen years. Instead of forcing a new sound, this album feels like Arctic Monkeys, as a band, are deciding to purely have fun and explore more of the music-making world that they love.
“The Car” begins with the track “There'd Better be a Mirrorball,” a song that sets the stage for Turner's signature melodic but complex lyricism that fans are accustomed to. “There'd Better be a Mirrorball” is hard to describe as anything but orchestral, even down to its meaning. This song details the relationship that Turner finds himself in with a potential love interest, finding himself struggling to navigate the line between common sense and feelings of romantic love that he is trying to stave off. Turner knows this is a line that he should cross, as his love interest is skeptical of any positive outcome of their romance. Thus we see Turner in a state of hopeful defeat, knowing that his love interest will likely “walk [him] to the car” but still hoping for one last dance under the figurative “Mirrorball.” The first track introduces a cliffhanger for the album, leaving listeners unsure if it will be dominated by themes of heartbreak and longing instead of pleasure and satisfaction.
Another song from the album that truly stands out is “Sculptures of Anything Goes.” With a hard guitar riff, this song emanates Alex Turner’s anger about the fans’ reception of his more recent work. He emphasizes that he is becoming cynical to the world of music-making because he has been put in a box confining him to the persona and type of music associated with his most popular album, “AM.” This is most clearly visible with lines that he includes from the perspective of his listeners, mentioning the “horrible new sound” that the band has adopted and stating that they “ain’t what they used to be.” Clearly, Turner is aware that there will always be backlash to his band’s evolution, but he persists, stating that he will merely continue to “sing a tune.” making himself and his band happy.
“Big Ideas” falls into this same box, with Turner reminiscing about the success that he has had with his earlier albums as compared to the reception that he received for his most recent album “Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino," as well as foreshadowing the reception that he expects to receive on this one. He recalls the “nationwide festivities” and “hysterical scenes” that fans would make in reaction to their prior, more rock-adjacent releases. However, Turner is still brashly unaffected and accepting of the fact that their sound has changed to cater towards a different audience. The rock and roll lifestyle of their youth being traded for the stun of an orchestra is not only tolerated, but welcomed.
The rest of the songs from this album; “I Ain't Quite Where I Think I Am,” “Jet Skis On The Moat,” “Body Paint,” title track “The Car,” “Hello You,” “Mr Schwartz,” and “Perfect Sense,” taken individually, tell stories of scandalous relationships, building attraction, and growing up. Collectively, they show that although this is the same Arctic Monkeys, the band has entered a new chapter that we as audiences must respect.
Ultimately from this album, listeners will hear a lot of the thematic material that they are used to: Intimate stories about dysfunctional relationships, new romantic endeavors that Turner is embarking on, and even some of that British-punk style Arctic Monkeys charm that fans have come to love. However, audiences will also find something new in Alex Turner’s vocals: defeat and humility. The poor fanbase reception that releases since “AM” have endured has made him much more self-conscious to what the band creates. However, this does not mean that Turner’s confidence in his art has shrunk in the context of this album. Rather he embraces that he continues to grow and evolve as an artist and will continue to. "The Car" sees the band letting go of the sound of their past in a way that is void of regret and instead driving forward.

In a line from her latest single, “The Loneliest Time,” Carly Rae Jepsen energetically calls out “I’m coming back for you, baby!
The song, featuring Rufus Wainwright, is upbeat, catchy, and has more than 11 million views on TikTok — and this line has gone viral for a good reason. This breathy spoken word interjection calls to mind disco vibes, replete with fuzzy ‘80s filters in the accompanying music video. Oh, and with glitter everywhere, of course. “The Loneliest Time” has the undeniable pop grooviness she’s known for. It follows in the legacy set by Jepsen’s other smash hits, “Call Me Maybe” and “I Really Like You.”
However, the album as a whole is more nuanced than the title track suggests. Written during the lockdown and released on Oct. 21 the album approaches familiar topics like love, longing, and grief with a maturity that speaks to the unusually reflective period it was written in. In songs like “Bends,” longing is interspersed with introspection. Set alongside a laid-back thrumming beat, she whispers gently, “Hold me in your humble grace 'cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too.”
This contemplative mood is felt throughout the album. In “Bad Thing Twice,” Jepsen asks, “Is it my, is it my destiny? I wanna do a bad thing twice.” Although the rest of the song is addressed to an unnamed “you,” her supposed lover is not just a stereotypical object of longing but a mirror through which she considers the contours of her own life. She injects stereotypical pop tropes with a refreshing thoughtfulness.
This maturity results in an album with a markedly different sound from her previous work. She experiments with different genres and sounds, from the congas in “Western Wind” to the sultry twinkles in “Sideways.” There is a real sense of Jepsen’s maturity as an artist and creative. While some may see these forays into different sounds as a lack of cohesiveness, it is precisely this willingness to move beyond the typical “pop beats” and TikTok-ready songs that makes Jepsen’s work stand out. Despite the somber lyrics, Jepsen’s experimentation is a joyful display of her musical range. She continues to surprise even now.
“Beach House” is a testament to this growth as a person and an artist. She moves from the singular “you” to the general “boys around the world” as she addresses the shocking (and sadly, relatable) disappointments that come with dating apps. This is not a “woe-is-me” song though. She reasserts herself declaratively as she repeats “I got a beach house in Malibu and I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings.” She moves between personal reflection and social commentary without missing a beat.
This emotional intensity reaches its peak in the slowed-down song “Go Find Yourself or Whatever.” With its steady beat and mellow sound, Jepsen’s voice loses its upbeat pop-music tones as she sentimentally croons “So go find yourself or whatever I hope it treats you better than I could do And I'll wait for you.” It feels like a country-style ballad in the best way possible. Her lyrics viscerally capture her maturity — the responsibility is on her lover to find themselves, it is not her burden. The singer behind is wiser than the relentlessly romantic head-over-heels persona she first embodied in “Call Me Maybe.”
It is after this considered portrayal of relationships that the title track “The Loneliest Time” comes up. In light of her ruminations on love, destiny, and growth, it is impossible to see the famous line “I’m coming back for you baby!” as just another fun disco-party call-to-action. It is weighed with a certain melancholic undertone, a fraught longing. Its energetic beat breaks through the contemplation with a payoff that feels rejuvenating and fresh but considered. She takes her listeners on her journey to maturity.
A quick note must be made of the three bonus tracks: “Anxious,” “Thinking Over The Weekend,” and “Keep Away.” It is obvious why they are relegated to bonus tracks: They don’t fit within the narrative of growth and empowerment that her album carefully charts out. This separation speaks to a unified artistic vision that shines through.
While the experimentation with different sounds may at times feel incohesive, it is a fresh breath of air for an artist who’s been around since 2008. Being released on the same day as Taylor Swift’s album “Midnights” might have drawn some of the focus away from Jepsen, but hers is an album worth listening to, especially for fans who have followed her since her earlier days. Do not be fooled by her TikTok fame, this is an album that breaks away from pop trends to present an important message about self-reflection. The album makes it clear: Jepsen has grown as both a person and an artist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a summer evening perhaps better spent watching the Celtics play in the NBA Finals, I instead stepped inside a sweltering community center in Cambridge to attend a meeting.
Thirty minutes later, it wasn’t just the midafternoon sun causing the uncomfortable heat. Across from me, several residents demanded changes affecting a street on Harvard’s doorstep: Memorial Drive.
Memorial Drive is an example of a concept called “open streets” — programs that open streets to people by closing them to cars. On open streets, people enjoy space together, whether jogging, cycling, or rollerblading. Harvard students living in River houses see this every weekend or even use the park themselves.
During the pandemic, the city closed Memorial Drive to cars on both Saturdays and Sundays to provide open space, expanding a decades-old policy of closing parts of the area on Sundays. The Cambridge City Council extended this program through December of this year because of its immense popularity.
Since I began attending Harvard, I have enjoyed seeing people outside enjoying the space the park provides. I love the quietness and the feeling of community that arrives every weekend. It is a welcome change of pace from the speeding cars that I typically encounter on weekdays.
At this meeting, however, a few residents held a different view. They implored the city council to reopen Memorial Drive to cars on Saturdays.
City council meetings, community events, and social media posts reflect the controversy of open streets. They are often the first steps to reducing car dependency; as a result, they become a battleground between opposing visions for the future of cities.
Following that meeting, I visited neighborhoods in Boston to learn how people are reclaiming our streets. Here is what I learned five months later.
Memorial Drive is only one of many open streets programs in our area. This past summer, Boston mayor Michelle Wu introduced “Open Streets Boston,” a series of pilot programs in different neighborhoods in the city. During these open streets programs, people could walk up to food trucks and local businesses, play games with their children, or enjoy music in a festival-like atmosphere.
I went to the first Open Streets Boston program in Jamaica Plain. As I walked, a woman in an adaptive bicycle skirted past me. A father chatted with his son in Haitian Creole. Two people played cornhole, and dogs barked at children blowing bubbles. It was incredible seeing the diversity and energy of Boston on full display. That day, people of different ages, abilities, backgrounds, languages, and cultures chose to reclaim their streets.
There is something undeniably special about bringing people together outdoors. In our post-lockdown period, we have seen a massive decline in mental health, widespread reports of loneliness and exclusion, and problems accommodating disabled communities. Open streets provide help for all of those needs. They allow people to take over areas previously dominated by fast, noisy cars. Compared to normal usage, these programs are safe and vibrant.
Not to mention incredibly successful. From San Francisco to Philadelphia, cities have massively invested in pedestrianized spaces. The reason why is quite simple: People love them. The feeling of safety, the community, and the freedom not to have to drive proved popular in places like New York City and Durham, North Carolina. Boston’s Open Newbury Street program and Copley Connect study, which I also visited, demonstrated the demand for more open spaces in our area.
But the residents at the community meeting were still unhappy. They described how cars would speed through residential areas late at night and how, without warning, the park would close to vehicles on holidays. Listening to residents and visiting programs throughout Boston, I learned something: open streets can be successful, but only if cities do them right.
Implementing these programs requires large-scale city planning. Cities should improve traffic signals on detour roads and design traffic calming measures to lessen the impact of vehicular traffic. They should also increase transit frequency — something Boston failed to do with their open streets pilots. Law enforcement officers could enforce traffic violations like “blocking the box.”
Just as equally, the implementation requires buy-in from residents. One concern during the Memorial Drive process was the lack of communication between City officials and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which controls the park. If residents are unaware of changes, they are less likely to support them, even if they provide a benefit. Providing language access, physical signage, and clear detour markings would go a long way in garnering support for open spaces.
The effort is worth it. When done well, these programs have overwhelmingly positive impacts on our public health, accessibility, climate, and more.
People love open streets. I don’t blame them. Comparing Memorial Drive with cars and Memorial Drive with people, the difference is noticeable: cleaner air, increased public activities, and friendliness to families. A chance to enjoy the Charles River. It is an asset for residents and the Harvard community.
Open streets exemplify the best way we can build communities and cities around people — together.

I’ve been having some trouble with my contact lenses, and I stopped wearing them altogether a few weeks ago while waiting for a new prescription. So autumn fell into soft focus. Buildings grew halos, posters abstracted into patterned tiles, expressions became even harder to read. Sure, it was difficult to navigate — I grew to assume that most shapes wouldn’t form symbols — but I delighted in how the chandeliers folded into the ceiling and learned to recognize friends from the way they walk.
Last week, the optometrist gave me a pair of temporary lenses, and everything crystallized from wobbly-warbly into sharp relief: I could see the edges of individual leaves, uneven window panes, flecks on lamp posts where paint used to be. Now, this was delightful in a completely new way! Walking down the street, I was amazed at each grain in the sidewalk. Everything felt fresh with possibility and depth.
How far could I see? Were those lights always strung around that tree like so? How different those two neighboring rooms were, one cozy-warm and one fluorescent-violet! So many textures worn with serendipity and care!
These days, not just because of my improved prescription, I often find myself thinking about phenomenology. Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy that focuses on how we experience things in the world, what those experiences might reveal about the world, and the meanings we make in it. Phenomenology considers, for example, how we perceive things given social, cultural, linguistic, and biological background conditions.
Each of us has a unique phenomenological perspective. That is, we have idiosyncratic ways of experiencing the world, which shape how we think and act. But our perspectives are also constantly being constructed and revised. My dad likes desserts with pistachios, for example, so those catch my eye even when he’s not around; my professor often mentions that 20 gallons of water go into a cup of coffee, from growing beans to transportation costs, so I have begun to picture individual objects as containing their preceding actions; my friend Leticia taught me about “patina”, the patterns that objects gain with use and age, so now I notice the creases and grooves in weathered buildings and shoes. And naturally, as the way I experience the world changes, so does the way I think and act.
Therefore, when we think about the future, it’s crucial to think about phenomenology. One, because we must remember that we can’t separate ourselves from our current experiences and mental models of the world. And two, because we ought to consider more deeply how our current expectations, habits, actions, worries, and hopes shape the spaces we will inherit. Thinking about the future, then, becomes an experiment in phenomenological imagination and empathy. In doing so, it becomes clear how many diverse ways there are of seeing the world and its futures.
Recently, I started prompting friends to more concretely imagine their future perspectives by asking: What advice do you think your future self would give your current self?
I received various responses: that many big things are indeed small; that many paths lead to the same place, and one path can lead to many places; to relax; to work harder; to take a step back; to cherish interpersonal relationships; to sleep enough. (One friend stopped me when I asked. “Hold on,” he said. “If my future self is giving me advice, isn’t that what I should be doing now?” I just smiled and shrugged.)
When I tried thinking through this question, I wondered how much my future phenomenological perspective would diverge from my current one. On the one hand, I expected a lot of differences: It seems like even in the last two years, a tremendous number of questions have gripped me, equations have tested me, and colors have dazzled me. I can only imagine what else I’ll learn in classes and conversation-walks. On the other hand, I would not be surprised if I stayed mostly the same: hoping to do as much good as I can and still uncertain which axis to do it along.
Anyways, future self, here’s the advice I think you’d give me (and, in turn, my advice for you):
1. Move your brain and body in unexpected ways. Go to talks, read widely, ask questions, stop to notice a tree, take walks, see plays. Find interesting people, places, and things. Sing! Celebrate! Dance! Make music!
2. Be honest and intentional. Remember names. Give sincere compliments. Ask clarifying questions. Don’t multitask. Don’t pretend you know things you don’t.
3. Habits are important. They keep you grounded, give you boundaries, set the tone. When you keep making exceptions, that’s when the positive feedback loops begin, until you trip from one day into the next. So be deliberate. Get enough sleep. Keep your space in order. Listen to yourself. Take care. Rest your eyes.
4. Be kind, open, and thoughtful. Do good. Love deeply. Breathe. Pick up litter and lost souls. Bias toward good actions. Listen and stay humble. Give yourself enough time and space to think. Let others know that you notice when they feel cold or anxious; let others know when you need help.
5. Things are organic and wobbly. But hey. Try your best and take it easy.
Did I get any of that right?

To Horace Mann, the secretary of the country’s first state education board, education was “the great equalizer of conditions of men — the balance wheel of the social machinery.” Public education, at that time still a radical experiment, was to be the mechanism by which any child, regardless of their background, could become a capable and informed citizen.
Over a century and a half after Mann’s era, public education still falls short of his lofty aspirations; the benefits of education have been handed out unevenly, and those that gain the most from public education continue to be those who had the most when they arrived. Yet even with economic effects in question, the civic effects are clear, as public education has been shown to increase health, volunteerism, and civic engagement.
It is on this civic front that public education is unique as “the great equalizer;” learning math or history alongside students from other racial, economic, and religious backgrounds teaches public school students more than just math or history. They are learning how to be citizens in a cosmopolitan society, how to understand other points of view, and how to respect others because of, not despite, their differences — including, in a country with a proud national myth and murky history regarding the matter, their religious differences
Public education is the cornerstone of our pluralistic society. So it should come as no surprise that Christian Nationalists are launching a full-frontal assault to undermine it.
In 2015, a group of low-income parents sought to use funds from a state program in Montana to fund the education of their children at Stillwater Christian School. The program, however, only funded education at secular private schools, citing a Montana state requirement that the government cannot fund religiously-affiliated education. The parents filed a lawsuit, and a slim 5-4 Supreme Court majority ruled in their favor in Espinoza v. Montana. The Court also struck down a similar policy in Maine in Carson v. Makin this past June. In Maine, funding could be applied to religious schools, provided they passed a certain benchmark of providing a comparable secular education. That policy, however, was similarly ruled unconstitutional.
These two cases represent a startling entanglement between government funding of education and religion; under these rulings, states not only can fund religious education, but in cases where they offer funding to any non-public school, they must fund religious education.
Religious grounding for education is nothing new; Bible readings and teacher-led prayers were legal in public schools as recently as the 1960s, but they were both eventually removed because government entities are charged with being religiously neutral under the Establishment Clause. Public schools, as government-funded programs, thus inherit the same charge as their overseers: to serve the public, regardless of their identities.
Private religious schools do not have these obligations, an exception they frequently exploit not just in their curricula, but in their admissions and hiring practices as well. BGLTQ students and teachers are often subject to expulsion, with some schools that had signed up for the Montana program listing “homosexual behavior” alongside “incest” and “sexual abuse” as forms of sexual immorality and requiring job applicants to affirm that they do not engage in such behavior. Religious schools have also been given broad latitude to discriminate in the form of Title VII and Title IX exemptions that have allowed schools like Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School to fire a teacher due to a narcolepsy diagnosis. And with the segregationist legacy of American private schooling proving difficult to shake, private school students are largely insulated from people with different racial, religious, and sexual identities.
Decisions like Espinoza and Carson require that public funds go to schools like these. Requiring that public funds designated for education be sent to discriminatory institutions to be used in explicit religious instruction is more than just counterproductive. In the words of National Education Association president Becky Pringle, it “erodes the foundation of our democracy and harms students.” We fail our children by denying them a secular, pluralistic education that prepares them to live in modern society.
As an atheist, I personally believe that all religious assertions should be challenged, and that instructing our children to take any teaching as an immutable fact, even a religious tenet, is to do them a disservice. But regardless of religion, it is impossible to engage meaningfully in our society without being confronted by the possibility that your beliefs are wrong. That confrontation is uncomfortable, but that discomfort is a fact of life in a religiously diverse country. Public education, at its best, prepares students to confront that discomfort head on in ways that private religious education never can.
Our public education system is imperfect. But the solution is to invest in it more heavily, not to funnel those resources away to schools that insulate their students from the diversity (religious or otherwise) of the modern world. When we discard true pluralism in favor of a  certain religious truth, we prevent education from becoming “the great equalizer” imagined by Horace Mann and generations of educators since. A respectful pluralistic society begins in the schools, and we have a responsibility to ensure that they are supported for the generations that follow us.

In a six-year high, 27 students were forced to withdraw from Harvard College during the 2020-2021 academic year due to academic dishonesty, according to a report released this month.
The Honor Council heard a total of 138 academic integrity cases during the school year. The 2020-2021 school year marked the highest number of cases and withdrawals since the Honor Council came into effect in 2015.
Harvard moved classes online during the 2020-2021 school year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and exams for both semesters were administered online. Roughly 5,231 undergraduates enrolled in fall 2020 while 20 percent of admitted students opted to defer enrollment.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana chairs the Honor Council, a group of students, faculty, and administrators who adjudicate cases of academic dishonesty.
Ninety-nine of the 138 reviewed cases resulted in a finding of responsibility, meaning that an academic dishonesty violation did occur. According to the report, students who are forced to withdraw must be employed in a full-time, paid, non-academic job for at least six months before they can petition for readmission to Harvard. The length of withdrawal is usually between two to four terms.
An additional 56 students were put on probation, a notice from the College that future violations may lead to more serious consequences. Another 10 students were admonished, a warning that falls short of probation. The Honor Council referred six students for a local sanction, meaning the faculty member leading the course decides the appropriate disciplinary action — for example, a grade penalty or mandatory tutoring.
College spokesperson Jonathan Palumbo declined to comment on possible causes for the spike in academic dishonesty violations.
“Harvard College is committed to the transparent reporting of data and ensuring a wide range of information is available to the community,” Palumbo wrote in an emailed statement. “We do not have a comment on changes in data from year to year.”
The Honor Council reviewed 88 cases involving freshmen, marking the fifth consecutive year in which they were “significantly overrepresented” in cases, according to the report.
More than 120 cases involved courses in the Sciences division and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Infractions referred by Humanities and Social Sciences courses comprised less than 15 percent of all cases.
Plagiarism and exam cheating were the most cited concerns in Honor Council cases. Inappropriate collaboration dropped from 27.6 percent of cases in the 2019-2020 academic year to 12 percent in the 2020-2021 academic year.
Even as academic dishonesty cases spiked in the 2020-2021 year, Administrative Board disciplinary actions against undergraduates reached a six-year low. During the 2020-2021 year, the Ad Board required two students to withdraw for disciplinary offenses, while 16 were forced to withdraw due to academic reasons not related to dishonesty.
The last year that the College saw a similar number of academic misconduct cases was in 2016-2017, when more than 60 enrollees in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” — roughly 10 percent of the class — were referred to the Honor Council for alleged academic dishonesty.
During the 2016-2017 academic year, the Honor Council heard 128 academic dishonesty cases in total and 24 students were required to withdraw from the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alan M. Garber ’76 has the resumé of a Harvard president: More than a decade as the University's top academic officer, the founder of two medical research centers at Stanford, and a trio of graduate degrees.
But with the search for Harvard’s 30th leader underway, he says he’s “very happy” where he is — as the school’s No. 2.
“I am very happy serving as Harvard’s Provost,” Garber said in an interview Friday. “I am very much focused on doing my work as provost to the best of my abilities, and ensuring a smooth transition to the next president.”
Garber’s pedigree naturally invites speculation about his presidential prospects. His response to questions about the top job mirror remarks from another potential internal candidate — Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, who told The Crimson last month she has “a great job” that she is “singularly focused on.”
As Harvard’s chief academic officer, Garber works closely with departments and offices across the school to advance research and University-wide initiatives. He also directly oversees more than a dozen administrative units, including Harvard University Health Services, the Office for Gender Equity, and the Office for Climate and Sustainability.
In 2017, during the presidential search that ultimately selected Lawrence S. Bacow, several prominent donors and professors at Harvard identified Garber as a likely internal candidate for the University’s top job.
Trained as both an economist and a physician, Garber taught at Stanford before becoming Harvard’s provost in 2011. In the decade since, he has reported to former Harvard president Drew G. Faust and her successor, Bacow, who announced in June that he plans to step down next summer.
Asked what skills or experiences would be most critical for Bacow’s successor, Garber listed an understanding of Harvard’s values, openness to free debate, and an ability to foster public trust in research produced across the University.
Despite their eclectic academic and personal backgrounds, one qualification for the Harvard presidency has remained nearly constant over the past century: having a Ph.D. Since James B. Conant, Class of 1914, took over Massachusetts Hall’s corner office in 1933, Harvard has been led by just one president without a Ph.D. — Derek C. Bok, who holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School.
But Garber, who said he has “a lot of confidence” in the search committee’s selection process, said the Ph.D. is not a line in the sand for presidential contenders.
“If they decide on a candidate that does not have a Ph.D. it will be because they had many other strong qualities that made up for the lack of the Ph.D,” Garber said of the 15-member search panel.
Garber said one of the incoming president’s first priorities will be addressing the Supreme Court’s ruling on an anti-affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard that it heard last month.
He said the lawsuit is “on the minds of nearly everyone in the Harvard community” and will likely be top of mind for the 30th president.
“We’re obviously hopeful that the decision will go our way, but we have to be prepared for the possibility that it won’t,” Garber said.
The court’s opinion is expected to come down next summer, but conservative justices — who outnumber their liberal counterparts, 6-3 — appeared skeptical of race-conscious admissions during oral arguments last week.
Garber declined to comment on how long he envisions staying in the provost role after a new president takes office, offering only that he is “committed to making sure that the next president can get off to a good start.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel discussed the history and impact of the Indian Child Welfare Act — which faces a challenge in the U.S. Supreme Court — at a Harvard Institute of Politics Forum on Monday evening.
The Supreme Court is set to hear a case Wednesday against the ICWA, a 1978 law regulating the foster care and adoption systems for Native American children to prioritize placement with relatives or other Native American households. The challenge to the law originated from a Texas adoption case and questions the constitutionality of the ICWA.
Ryan H. Doan-Nguyen ’25 began the event with a land acknowledgment, recognizing that Harvard University was built on the ancestral land of the Massachusett people and neighbors the lands of the Wampanoag and Nipmuc peoples.
The forum included a screening of the short film “First Light,” which details the forced removal of Indigenous children from their families and their placement into white households.
After the film’s conclusion, a panel of indigenous rights organizers and experts — featuring April Fournier, Sandy White Hawk, Judith LeBlanc, Mishy Lesser, and Chris Newell — discussed the ICWA, contextualizing the policy’s history and defending its importance in the healing process of Indigenous people.
Fournier, program manager at Advance Native Political Leadership, drew from her family’s experience with forced adoption, describing how her mother “lost her culture and lost her access to her family for more than 30 years” after being taken from her sick parent.
Fournier, who is Diné, said her mother “would have been able to keep that relationship instead of trying to overcome the trauma that she did for all of those years” if she had been placed with a relative or Native American family, as she would have under ICWA.
“As soon as we hear this challenge to this law that has helped many families, that sounds all the alarm bells,” Fournier said.
Lesser — learning director of the Upstander Project, the organization that created "First Light" — said the ICWA was sparked by a movement of Native American family members feeling the loss of their loved ones.
“It was born out of women, mostly — aunties, grandmothers, mothers, sisters — sharing the agony of having their children taken from them,” Lesser said. “It wasn’t born in the Senate.”
In the face of a Supreme Court decision potentially striking down ICWA, Fournier highlighted the importance of having Indigenous people in elected positions of power.
“If we can’t rely on the federal courts, we know that we also need to have local elected officials,” she said. “The only way that we’re going to have a voice in Congress is if we learn how to run for office because the system wasn’t built for us.”
Newell, who is Passamaquoddy, mourned the potential loss of the ICWA.
“If we were to have a Supreme Court that will do this, they go against history, they go against precedent,” Newell said. “They undo a whole lot of things, and it destroys a future for my children and their children going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council may soon ban turning right on red lights.
During a Monday evening meeting, the Council voted 7-2 to adopt a policy order directing City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 and city staff to investigate the feasibility of banning right turns on red lights in Cambridge.
The policy order calls on the city to consider banning the driving maneuver to “protect vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists” in accordance with Cambridge’s Vision Zero goals for traffic safety.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who co-sponsored the order, said in an interview that Cambridge needs to identify sources of “dangerous conflicts” between drivers and other road users such as pedestrians and bikers.
“We really just need to make sure that those cars are looking out for folks who are more vulnerable than they are in their cars,” she said.
Mallon cited data from a study in Washington, D.C. that examined banning right turns on red at 100 intersections and found a steep decline in vehicle-on-vehicle conflicts and vehicles failing to yield to pedestrians. The City Council in the District of Columbia has since voted to ban right on red at most intersections by 2025.
According to Mallon, around 70 to 75 percent of intersections in Cambridge already prohibit right turns at red lights with a traffic sign. She said codifying a full ban would signal to other Boston-area municipalities that they should implement similar policies.
“If we really want true safety improvements across the region, we need to be a leader in this,” Mallon said.
But Councillor Paul F. Toner, who voted against the order, described it as “unnecessary,” citing the high prevalence of site-specific prohibitions on right turns at red lights in the city.
“The city traffic authority already has the authority right now to go out and put ‘no turn on red’ signs up anywhere they think it’s unsafe,” Toner said in the meeting. “I just suggest that we continue to follow our current practice.”
In the meeting, the Council unanimously voted on two amendments to the order that gives the Cambridge Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation the flexibility to allow right turns on red in cases “without any negative safety impacts.”
If the ban is finalized, Cambridge will become one of a handful of American cities that prohibit right turns on red. In addition to Washington D.C., right on red is illegal in New York City and downtown Ann Arbor, Mich.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite starting the season 3-0 going into a rivalry game against the Yale Bulldogs on Saturday, head coach Ted Donato thought that the No. 15 Harvard Men’s Ice Hockey team had only played “spurts of good hockey,” including Friday’s 5-2 triumph over Brown. However, after soundly defeating the Bulldogs 4-0, Donato saw signs that the team is starting to round into top form.
In their final home games until January 2023, the Crimson put up complete performances with an explosive power play, a smothering penalty kill, and strong team defense contributing to two convincing wins against ECAC Hockey competition, helping Harvard start 4-0 for the third consecutive season.
“I thought tonight was the first time we kind of put it together where we played fast, we simplified the game,” Donato said. “I think Yale came out strong as well, and I feel like we had to raise our intensity and I felt the guys did a nice job with that.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
Despite struggling with slow starts during the preseason and the season opener against Dartmouth, the Crimson came out of the gates strong on Friday night, notching two power play goals in the opening frame. After killing off part of an early holding penalty to first-year defenseman Mason Langenbrunner, Harvard was handed just over a minute of power play time following an interference call on Brown forward Bradley Cocca, committed while the Bears were on the man advantage. The Crimson made the most of their abbreviated power play, quickly setting up into a 1-3-1 formation, and sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, stationed at the left faceoff circle, fired a hard pass into the slot, where junior forward Alex Laferriere redirected the puck past Brown goaltender Mathieu Caron for an early 1-0 Harvard lead.
“I think he was definitely harping on that all week,” said Laferriere regarding Donato’s emphasis on starting strong. “We have team meetings and stuff like that where we internally know that we have to do that in order to win games against good teams. And I think that's definitely something that we wanted to focus on this weekend.”
The Crimson power play and Laferriere struck again late in the first period, capitalizing on a tripping penalty called on Bears forward Zachary Tonelli. This time, a cross ice pass from Coronato at the left circle found junior forward Sean Farrell at the right circle, and Farrell quickly fed a soft backhand pass into the high slot, where Laferriere hammered a one-timer off the crossbar and into the net for his second goal of the game, extending the Harvard lead to 2-0. First-year goaltender Aku Koskenvuo, making his first collegiate start, only faced three shots on goal as the Crimson offense kept most of the play in the Brown’s defensive zone.
Early in the second period, Harvard kept the pressure on, as Caron was forced to make a series of key stops in the first minute of action, robbing Farrell of a sure goal while out of position during a chaotic netfront scramble and then denying Laferriere from point blank range with a strong glove save. However, just under three minutes into the second period, a poor line change by the Bears created open ice in the middle of the neutral zone, and senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun found first-year forward Casey Severo for a breakaway. Despite being harassed by Brown defenseman Jackson Munro, Severo made a nice backhand-forehand move and roofed the puck over Caron’s glove for his first collegiate goal, stretching the Crimson advantage to 3-0.
Despite the deficit, the Bears did not go away quietly, answering back two minutes later. After a great play by Brown forward Gavin Puskar to keep the puck in the offensive zone and avoid an offsides, Puskar and forward Ryan Bottrill set up a give-and-go, with Bottrill sending a great pass through the slot to a cutting Puskar, who was able to tap the puck past Koskenvuo from right in front of the net, cutting the Harvard lead to 3-1. The Crimson maintained the edge in play throughout much of the second period, but Brown had a chance to get back into the game when Harvard was forced onto a 5-on-3 penalty kill halfway through the period. However, Koskenvuo and the penalty kill locked down, preventing any further damage and maintaining a 3-1 edge going into the third period.
“It's a commitment to try to put pressure on the other team, and we're blessed to have some defensemen that not only are strong but they’re fast,” Donato said regarding the penalty kill. “They're able to force the other team into some mistakes and we're in a position where we try to use a good number of guys on the kill to stay fresh and be able to put pressure on teams.”
Early in the third period, the Bears had another chance to get back into the game when Langenbrunner was penalized for tripping, giving Brown a critical power play opportunity. But the Crimson snuffed out the threat with the penalty kill and Koskenvuo keeping the Bears out of the net; after a Brown player fell down in the offensive zone, Coronato and Farrell broke out on a 2-on-2 rush, with Farrell flying past the Bears defense and sliding the puck through Caron’s legs for a shorthanded goal, his first goal of the season, and a 4-1 lead for Harvard. Brown answered just over a minute later when forward Nathan Plessis outmuscled the Crimson defense for a loose puck and found forward Lynden Grandberg in front of the net for the tap-in goal, cutting the Harvard lead to 4-2. However, strong shot blocking and goaltending kept the Bears at bay, and first-year defenseman Ryan Healey secured three points for the Crimson with a late power play goal, tallying his first collegiate goal and sealed the 5-2 victory.
HARVARD 4, YALE 0
The Crimson dominated the first period right from the opening puck drop, outshooting the Bulldogs 13-1 in the first 20 minutes. Only four minutes in, Laferriere, coming off a two-goal performance on Friday against Brown, broke into the offensive zone and found linemate sophomore forward Alex Gaffney speeding down the left wing. Gaffney accelerated to the net and fired a hard wrist shot through the legs of Yale goaltender Nathan Reid, giving Harvard an early 1-0 lead. The Crimson kept their offensive attack moving after the early goal, with first-year forward Philip Tresca narrowly firing a one-timer from the slot wide to Reed’s left, and several other chances enabled by big rebounds allowed by Reid. With just over six minutes remaining, the line of Laferriere, sophomore forward Zakary Karpa, and Gaffney struck again, as Laferriere made a power move to force his way down the right wing and behind the net. He then fired a behind-the-back pass to Gaffney, who shot the puck off of Karpa’s leg and into the net, extending the Harvard advantage to 2-0 going into the first intermission.
“I think last year, obviously being a first-year in college hockey, you’re kind of a little nervous, don't wanna throw the weight around a little bit, but then you kind of know what you have to do in the offseason,” Laferriere said. “I put on a lot of weight in the offseason, so I think I'm just trying to use that to my advantage now.”
The Crimson’s offensive onslaught continued in the second period, backed by a raucous student section, with Harvard recording a 47-17 advantage in shot attempts at the end of two periods of play. Less than a minute into the period, first-year forward Joe Miller connected with Coronato for a breakaway chance, but Coronato hit the post to keep the Crimson lead at 2-0. The line of Farrell, Miller, and Coronato continued its strong play with a behind the net feed from Farrell to Miller in front of the net, but Reid was able to slide across to make the save. Just over five minutes into the period, Harvard’s red-hot power play had a chance to extend the lead, but the Bulldogs’ penalty kill was able to keep the Crimson at bay, largely keeping Harvard outside of the prime scoring areas. At even strength, however, the Crimson attack kept humming, as Laferriere bodied a Bulldogs defender off the puck before finding Langenbrunner in the high slot for a shot that hit the right post, and first-year forward Marek Hejduk’s wrap around after a burst of speed around the net just missed the far post. Laferriere and Hejduk produced strong shorthanded chances midway through the period, and Hejduk was able to tally his first collegiate goal after a great hand-eye play along the boards enabled him to race in for a breakaway, putting Harvard up 3-0. The Crimson also picked up a power play goal at the end of the period, as Laferriere maneuvered to the slot and roofed a backhand over Reid’s shoulder, giving Harvard a 4-0 lead at the end of the second period.
“It's obviously really fun to have all of them there supporting us,” Thrun said regarding the student turnout. “Obviously, Harvard-Yale is something far bigger than just our game on Saturday night. It's been a rivalry for hundreds of years. So I think to just be a part of that is something pretty unique.”
Despite taking three penalties in the third period, the Crimson’s penalty kill was up to the challenge, keeping Yale off the board and only allowing the Bulldogs to tally six shots on goal in the period, for a game total of 10. Coronato, Farrell, and Miller continued to click, as Farrell hit Harvard’s third post of the night after receiving a great pass from Coronato. Yale was able to generate more offense in the third period than it had all night, with Bulldogs forward Ian Carpentier also hitting the post just after a Yale power play had expired. However, despite only facing four shots on goal through two periods, senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson stayed sharp in the third period, making some strong saves with his pad to preserve a shutout performance and a 4-0 Crimson victory. After the game, Laferriere was awarded the Tim Taylor Cup, given to the best player in the Harvard-Yale hockey game played at Bright-Landry Center every season.
“It feels pretty good, I think I got lucky with a couple good plays by [Alex Gaffney] tonight,” said Laferriere after winning the Taylor Cup. “He played really well, Karpa played really well. So those guys definitely helped me out tonight.”
The Crimson will be on the road next weekend for two ECAC games, as it will take on the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Engineers on Friday before facing the Union College Dutchmen on Saturday. The team will not return to Bright-Landry Hockey Center until New Year’s Day, when it takes on the Northeastern University Huskies.

Yes, we know history is technically a social science. But let’s be real: you didn’t know that until you read that sentence. So bear with us, and read ahead to find out why these sophomores declared concentrations in and around the humanities!
Elizabeth K. Roosevelt: I declared History because it makes me feel more justified when sneaking into the grad-student-only Robinson Library to live out my dark academia dreams. There’s nothing like the rush of standing with your ear glued to the door at 10p.m. to see if grad students are inside. But in all seriousness, I declared History the first day that declarations opened on my.Harvard because I felt at home in the department — growing up, my dream jobs were to be an archeologist or an author, and a historian is pretty much those two professions congealed into one. Ten-year-old (and twenty-year-old) Elizabeth is happy!
Eve S. Jones: When I was eight years old, I decided I wanted to study English, and I haven’t had the energy to reconsider since. Honestly, the best thing about being an English concentrator is that your readings are works you’d want to read anyway. My Goodreads account has never been happier — I’m on track to have read 80 books this year! (PSA: Everybody stop what you’re doing and read Passing by Nella Larsen.) It can be tough to be consistently full of literary hot takes, but if it’s between this or a p-set? Yeah, I’ll do some close reading any day.
Hana Rehman: I declared History and Science (concentration name: History and Science, department: History of Science — is it confusing? Yes. ) because I’m very indecisive. Do I want to cry at office hours every week while p-setting non-stop, or do I want to rewrite the same sentence five hundred times while writing an essay? Why not both <3? In all honesty, I’m a pre-med looking for a good ~interdisciplinary~ education that divides my studies in both STEM and the humanities so that my GPA doesn’t fall to the ground I can take a variety of classes in different departments and make the most of my Harvard academic experience.
