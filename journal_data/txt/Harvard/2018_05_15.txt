After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cannes reporters Mila Gauvin II and Caroline A. Tsai offer a daily blog round-up from the 71st annual Cannes Film Festival in France.
After Caroline’s and my harrowing arrival to Cannes, we told ourselves, “Things can only go up from here!” As Caroline relayed in the previous installment of Cannes Par Jour, we were able to reserve a room for two at a much cheaper hotel, just 10 minutes away from the Palais des Festival. When we found the hotel room online, I feared that reserving it on the computer wouldn’t be a quick enough way to book it. After all, according to the website, several other people were looking at the room. Whether the warning was a ploy to push interested parties into making a reservation, or an actual race for one last room in a city full of completely booked hotels, we will never know. Not willing to take the chance, I called the receptionist and managed to get us a 200 euro discount. A room for two on the second day of the Cannes Film Festival? Right next to the beach? That wasn’t insanely expensive? A miracle! (Turns out, it actually was a miracle. A press woman who had come to the same hotel for the past four years during Cannes had a medical emergency and is the only reason why we were able to find an available room in the first.)
Finally, we had a solid plan: Wake up at 7:15 a.m., get our press badges, go see the morning screening of the opening film for the festival, “Everybody Knows,” go back to the emergency hotel before check out at noon, move to the new hotel, grab a quick lunch and sunscreen, and proceed to watch the remainder of the movies Caroline scheduled into her Google calendar, in all its color-coded glory. Sounds doable, if not a bit fast-paced, right?
WRONG. I wake up to the sound of our door opening. It’s the cleaning lady, and she’s here to prepare the room for the next guests. I check my phone, disoriented, and immediately understand. “Caroline,” I yell across the room. She startles awake: “What?!” I raise my voice, “It’s 2 p.m.!” We’ve missed getting our press badges, checking out on time, seeing the red carpet screening of “Everybody Knows,” and getting to our second hotel. Another great start to the day.
The receptionist calls, “Are you planning on staying another night?” Nope, I respond, while Caroline and I both hastily throw the clothes we had haphazardly unpacked and strewn around the room and rush down to the lobby. Thankfully, we aren’t charged for a late checkout, and Uber our way to our new home. Once there, the woman at the desk is nice enough to make up for the traumatic events of yesternight (well, almost: Caroline’s account of our first evening in France was unfortunately not an exaggeration). She gives us a 50 percent discount for breakfast and takes our luggage up to our room herself. We get to our room, where we can finally decompress. There’s free water in the fridge, AC in the room (Yay! No nightly sweltering in air-conditionless France!) and two soft beds awaiting Caroline and me when we enter.
We quickly change and head off to grab our press badges (after passing by the hotel where our former host works, yikes!) when we finally make it to our first screening, “Donbass.” The line we wait in moves surprisingly quick, a somewhat misleading stroke of luck that will come back to screw us over. Next is “Birds of Passage” at another theatre, one associated with the Directors’ Fortnight. I have no idea where it is, so I walk alone, aimlessly wandering around for what feels like forever, Caroline having gone to see a different movie. And walk. And walk some more. Finally I make it (Caroline and I will soon come to find that the walk is actually quite short, less than 10 minutes on the beach, my initial skewed perception by both my aloneness and total cluelessness).
Walking home after a late reunion, we squeeze through the streets of Cannes, filled to the brim with late-night restaurant goers enjoying linguini and oysters, sipping red wine under the looming darkness. Caroline and I stare enviously at their plates, the menus conflictingly disheartening with their delicious meals but expensive prices. We’re tired, hungry—the cheap kiosk sandwiches are good, but will likely get old soon—and will be up for several more hours writing up our first reviews. Guess we’ll just have to catch the next day’s early screening (hint: we sleep through that one too too). But hey, after the hell of Day 0, things could be much, much worse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my review of “Woods,” I asked whether Earn would step up his game as Alfred’s manager. In this episode, Alfred asks himself the same question, to and the results are unsurprisingly, disappointing. Earn has set Alfred up with another (unpaid) gig at a college—“[F]irst it’s this, then it’s Spring Fling, and that’s $60K guaranteed,” he promises—but is too cheap pay for a hotel. Instead, the crew heads over to Violet’s (Jerusha Cavazos), a college student who has amassed a whopping 3000 Instagram followers and whose unhealthy crush on Al is supposed to secure Al’s performance at Spring Fling. Turns out she’s insane: She tells Al about a dream she had of them, in which she was a crocodile who ate him as a white crane. “And then this, like intense light just shot through my belly. And I knew that meant that we were connected,” she remembers. Unfortunately for Al, and ultimately Earn, that connection doesn’t last long.
Things come to a head when Violet catches Alfred talking to two female students, one of whom is writing a paper about the lyricism in Paper Boi’s raps. Their appreciation of his music is the real attention Alfred has so desperately been seeking throughout the second season. The two women don’t want to sleep with Alfred, or even post photos of him on their social media, but to share in their admiration for the work he puts into his music. Finally, Al’s star really starts to shine. Lucky for him, the rapper still manages to blend into the background, the blue sheen of his robe commanding an attention that does not put an overwhelming spotlight on him. The moment is endearing (Alfred even gives them a genuine smile!) but gets cut too short when Violet dumps her drink all over him in a jealous rage, after which the situation escalates quickly. Tracy (Khris Davis), who tagged along much to Earn’s disdain as Al’s bodyguard, pushes Violet down a flight of stairs. The scene is an exaggerated, slowed-down caricature of itself—why the emphasis on Violet’s flailing arms and legs? Why the melodramatic soundtrack of Nina Simone’s “Funkier Than A Mosquito Tweeter?” Why the concerted effort to obscure Violet’s face, as if to erase her personhood? The gang runs away before we can find out.
This confrontation is the last straw for Al. The men eventually find a safe haven in a frat house whose leader is in the midst of hazing some new recruits, where Al sits Earn down to lay down the law. “Look, you family, man, and I'm trying to ride with you, but sometimes that shit ain't enough, bro. 'Cause money is important,” Al says. The realization has been a long time coming. After all, it’s Robbin’ Season, and Al has already been robbed twice, two times too many. Al can’t grow if Earn keeps holding him back. “I gotta make my next moves my best moves, man, so. Something gotta shake,” he concludes. It’s the realest conversation the two have ever had. And it’s the biggest humiliation—though not the last of the episode—that Earn has ever faced, an uncanny reflection of the naked white pledges who stood naked, degraded, forced to dance to D4L’s “Laffy Taffy” as part of the hazing process in front of Al, Earn, Tracy, and Darius. But unlike the boys, whose humiliation may earn them a spot in the frat, Earn’s culminates in a downward spiral both professionally and personally.
With only two episodes left in the season, “Atlanta” is finally moving its narrative along. Al is moving forward, and Earn may be regressing, but at last, something is happening. The show has thus far been losing itself in its quirks and colloquialisms to the detriment of its storytelling. “North of the Border” combines the two in a way that grounds the characters in the reality of their situations without sacrificing the show’s signature, subtle bizarreness.
Laffy Taffys:
- I will say, Violet’s vengeance, while initially unwarranted, is quite impressively brutal. Where did she learn to cut like that?
- This is the second time Darius has mentioned jicama. I hope we find out to what end.
- Weed must be pretty important to Al if he’s willing to watch pledges dance naked in a room in front of a Confederate flag with guns hanging on the wall. But hey, they’re so cool they have a gun room, so it’s all good. Right?
- Earn really needs to learn he is not cut out for fighting, racing, or acting tough in any way shape or form. Earn versus Tracy? He should know better by now.

Posters plaster the glass walls of Professor Toni L. Griffin’s Gund Hall office. Each one depicts a map of the United States with data broken down by region, alongside a large word: “Resilience,” “Rights,” “Identity,” “Fairness,” “Acceptance,” and many more. Griffin teaches one course per semester at the Graduate School of Design, each revolving around her idea of a “just city.” FM sat down with Griffin at her new exhibit in Gund Library, “Design for the Just City,” named after her popular class, to discuss justice in urban environments including Cambridge.
Editor’s note: This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.
FM: What are some of the core values of the “just city”?
TG: It’s recognizing that every city or neighborhood is really different, so there wasn’t just one catch all “just city.” A just Houston is gonna look different than a just Albuquerque or a just LA or a just Minneapolis or a just Topeka, Kansas. We wanted a way for communities to be able to define justice for themselves and what elements of a just city meant for them. Lastly, we wanted to create a set of indicators and metrics that would allow communities to actually evaluate whether or not they got greater equity, or they got greater participation, or inclusion.
Today I believe that the just city has to work towards helping those who are most marginalized in cities, have the same benefits of those that are more privileged in the cities. So, issues of ownership, belonging, inclusion, diversity, acceptance, power, access, are just some of the values that I think are most important to the just city.
FM: What do you see as some of the major problems big cities face today?
TG: In the work that I do as an urban planner, in cities like Chicago, New York, Memphis, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Detroit, I have consistently found issues of disinvestment, blight, abandonment, racial segregation, income inequality, environmental justice, and, in each of those cities, I’ve found the exact same conditions. Also, in each of those cities, I’ve found that that condition predominantly affects people of color, women, and children.
FM: What would you say are possible solutions to these inequities?
TG: In the exhibition we just opened here in the GSD, “Design in the Just City,” we’re featuring four case studies of projects that we believe begin to tackle some of these injustices around populations who feel invisible, spaces that segregate, processes that don’t include and provide for inclusive participation, or spaces that intentionally have excluded people. The four projects include the 11th Street Bridge Park project in Washington, D.C., which is taking an old highway bridge trestle and turning that into a park, that actually it bridges both sides of the Anacostia river.  The west side of the river is a predominantly wealthy Capitol Hill neighborhood, the east side of the river is predominantly African American and is where a lot of African Americans were pushed out of communities during urban renewal in the 1960s and 70s. The bridge designed by OMA+OLIN partners is designed to obviously connect both sides of the river through the bridge structure, but has a number of programmatic features that are really intended to be a place where people come together. Spaces are situated in such a way that people from the west, more wealthy side of the river have to come across to the east side of the river to enjoy different amenities, like an environmental education center. So, putting those spaces there is facilitating a reason for people who ordinarily wouldn’t go to that side of the city to come to that side of the river and vice versa. There’s this intentionality of the programming that was placed there, and where it’s placed on the river, to help bridge communities and bridge people of difference in coming together.
FM: That sounds great. You live full time in New York but spend two days per week in Cambridge. What are some ways Cambridge can become more “just”?
TG: Cambridge is continuing to grow, both in terms of the local economy here, particularly around Kendall Square—it’s growing in population, but there’s not a lot of room to grow. So issues of affordability were certainly some of the more challenging conditions of injustice that the students [in the course last spring] saw on the ground. A lot of their propositions for justice had to do with how do local communities, particularly diverse communities of color, retain a sense of ownership and identity in a fast growing city with a fast growing economy. How to ensure that their identities aren’t erased from the fabric of how the city looks and feels, both in terms of the identity of the physical environment, but also the amenities and services that different populations, particularly foreign born populations, need in this city. Looking at ways to retain ownership, a material ownership of property through land trust and housing cooperatives that help build equity at the household level, for families to stay in Cambridge were just a few of the things that [the students] began to look at and propose.
FM: Is there anything Cambridge has done particularly well?
TG: I know that the city last year commissioned a citywide master plan and, as part of that, set up a number of different platforms to increase civic participation in the process of making a plan and a vision for the city. One of my colleagues was part of developing the tools and strategies to be used to be as inclusive as possible in that process. Many cities defer doing citywide master plans—they’re complicated, they take a long time, and to be done well they really should include as many voices as possible in that process. So, I think it’s great that the city has taken on the challenge of trying to put that forward-thinking vision forward, and to try to do that in a way that is inclusive of community voices. I think planning is done best when it’s not done by a single sector. So it’s not just the city’s plan, it’s not just the community’s plan, I think you have to bring all of those stakeholders to the table and really kind of work those issues out simultaneously. I think that planning is still in process, but I think that’s a smart thing to do particularly in a city that’s growing rapidly to try to get in front of the kind of issues that it’s facing and to try to put forward a shared vision for how to address them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bipartisan group of six senators wrote a letter to University President Drew G. Faust Friday, calling on her to fulfill her 2010 commitment to increase opportunities for students across the University to work in public service summer internships.
The letter, obtained by The Crimson, references Faust’s 2010 Commencement address, in which she announced that Harvard would commit to “doubling the current amount of funding for undergraduate summer service opportunities, and a significant increase for graduate students.”
Signed by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 and Senators Mike Crapo, Edward J. Markey, Daniel S. Sullivan ’87, Chris Van Hollen, and Elizabeth Warren, the letter expresses concerns that unpaid internships in the public sector will only be available to students who have “more financial resources.” Van Hollen initiated the process of writing the leader, according to Lindsay Northern, communications director for Crapo.
“Travel and living costs make accepting a no-pay or a low-pay position a real challenge for many students,” the letter reads. “Our understanding is that at Harvard, that means that hundreds of smart, dedicated, and passionate undergraduates are still denied the opportunity to take part in these critical learning opportunities every year—despite demonstrating strong interest to pursue them.”
The letter also references a Dec. 2017 Undergraduate Council resolution that calls on Harvard to provide an additional $1,219,500 per year above levels the University provided in 2016 in order to meet the 2010 goal Faust laid out in her speech. The resolution also asks the University to “guarantee at least one year of summer public service funding to all students in Harvard College.” The resolution, which the UC passed unanimously, also demands that the Office of the President respond to the UC’s call to action before Jan. 22, 2017.
According to UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19, Faust has not “responded directly” to the UC. But Zhang said Gene A. Corbin—who served as the assistant dean of student life for public service until this month—invited two representatives from the UC to participate in the “Seamless Service Pathways Process,” a program that aims to make public service options more transparent and accessible to students. The program is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a Nov. 2017 gift from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan to help low-income students participate in public service.
Zhang said she was not aware of the letter the senators sent Friday.
University Spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson said Faust plans to respond to the senators’ letter.
“President Faust has spoken with many alumni and members of Congress about Harvard’s commitment to public service,” Jackson wrote in an emailed statement.
Faust also spoke with Mass. Congresswoman Katherine Clark in April about support for public service at Harvard. In a letter to Clark after their conversation, Faust discussed current public service offerings and committed to working to increase these offerings.
“While our current opportunities continue to open so many doors, we will keep striving to develop more,” Faust wrote.
In 2015, Harvard received a $15 million gift from Eric M. Mindich ’88 and his wife Stacey to endow public service initiatives at Harvard. The gift included funding to develop 14 classes oriented around public service and to expand programming in established classes such as US-WORLD 24: “Reinventing (and Reimagining) Boston: The Changing American City.” It also provided funding to establish the Mindich Service Fellows Program, which supports up to 75 students pursuing summer public service work each year. The Mindich gift followed the 2011 Presidential Public Service Program, which supports 10 students annually in summer public service work.
The senators’ letter asks Faust to “set an example for colleges nationwide” by fulfilling her 2010 goal as she prepares to step down in June.
“We look forward to seeing the tremendous impact Harvard students will have in the future with sustained and strong support from the University,” the letter reads.
The signatories are some of Faust’s longstanding allies on Capitol Hill; on her trips to Washington over the course of her tenure, Faust has met with multiple members of the Senate and the Massachusetts delegation, including Schumer and Warren. Faust has spoken with lawmakers about a variety of issues, including legal protections for undocumented students, cuts to financial aid in the pending reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and the importance of federal research funding to the country’s colleges and universities.
This isn’t the first time Warren and Markey have called for change at Harvard. In May 2016, the two Mass. senators—along with two member of the House—sent Faust a letter calling on Harvard to voluntarily recognize a student union ahead of a National Labor Relations Board hearing on the disputed results of the 2016 election for graduate student unionization.
