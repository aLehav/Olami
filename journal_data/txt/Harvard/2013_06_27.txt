After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of a pair of Supreme Court decisions on two major same-sex marriage cases issued Wednesday, Harvard Law School professors praised the Justices for the landmark rulings that largely aligned with legal experts’ predictions.
“Nothing better could have emerged from the present Court,” Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe '62 wrote of the two decisions in an email. “This was a predictable but nonetheless significant victory.”
In United States v. Windsor, a five-Justice majority led by Anthony M. Kennedy struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, the national law defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Although the Court did not establish a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, its decision extends federal benefits to married couples who reside in one of the dozen states that currently recognize same-sex marriage.
“DOMA writes inequality into the entire United States Code,” wrote Kennedy, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1961, in the decision. “DOMA is unconstitutional as a deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution.”
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman agreed that the Justices largely acted as expected. “They did what most people predicted they would do based on what was said in the oral arguments,” he said. “But if you step back and look at it from the broader perspective, it’s an extraordinary thing that the Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional.”
Klarman said that Wednesday’s decisions signify tremendous progress for gay rights advocates, particularly given the widespread support for DOMA when Congress passed the legislation in 1996. “It’s a really big shift in people’s understanding of the Constitution and a reflection of a big shift in people’s attitudes towards same-sex marriage,” he said.
The majority opinion in the DOMA decision was not rooted in the issue of standing addressed in an amicus brief submitted by Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson in January. The Justices appointed Jackson to write the brief, which argued that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute.
The Justices devoted several pages of the opinion to addressing Jackson’s points, though ultimately dismissing them and ruling on the merits of the DOMA case. Jackson is currently travelling and was unavailable for comment on the opinions.
On Wednesday, the Court also issued a decision on Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case that addressed the constitutionality of Proposition 8, a California ban on same-sex marriage. In another five-to-four split, the Justices ruled that supporters of the law lacked the legal right to defend Proposition 8 in court, and sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions that it should be dismissed on procedural grounds.
In its ruling the Court did not make any sweeping decisions concerning same-sex marriage that would apply to all states. Nevertheless, Klarman predicted that the appellate court would comply with the Supreme Court’s instructions, effectively validating a lower court’s earlier ruling that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional in California.
“It’s likely that same-sex marriage will be legal in California and that it will take place in large numbers,” he said, adding that the “implications for any other state are nil.”
For his part, Tribe wrote that the implications of the Proposition 8 ruling remain unclear for the state of California. He added that nationally “the decision has no implications beyond the procedural conclusion that private parties generally lack standing to challenge rulings striking down statewide initiatives or referenda.”
In both decisions, Tribe noted a shift in the Justices’ tone on Wednesday from previous rulings, including Lawrence v. Texas, a sodomy case decided exactly a decade earlier.
“To me, the most striking thing—apart, of course, from the happy outcome—was the absence, anywhere except perhaps in Justice Scalia’s intemperate dissent in Windsor, of the kind of anti-gay rhetoric that peppered the pages of the United States Reports on prior occasions,” Tribe wrote.
Although Klarman noted that the Justices’ rulings made no promises or guarantees of what the Court might do in the future, Klarman said the opinions laid the groundwork for future cases that could lead to the establishment of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
“As public opinion continues to evolve, I think there will continue to be a higher probability that the Court will recognize such a right,” Klarman said, noting that the particular Justices who serve on the bench would also greatly influence any future rulings. “There is certainly a lot of ammunition within the opinion for people who want to bring lawsuits against state bans on same-sex marriage.”
On Wednesday, other Harvard affiliates celebrated the Justices’ rulings as a significant step forward for same-sex marriage advocates in gatherings held in places ranging from House common rooms in Cambridge to the steps of the Supreme Court building itself.
Harvard's first director of BGLTQ student life, Vanidy "Van" Bailey, learned of Wednesday’s decisions in the Quincy House Junior Common Room with members and supporters of Queer Students and Allies.
“To hear the cheers and the intense discussion was moving and inspiring,” Bailey wrote in an email, adding that Wednesday marked “one of the most historic days in the BGLTQ Rights Movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, agreed to join the edX consortium Tuesday, marking the virtual learning platform’s first expansion into India and its seventh into Asia.
To cement the partnership with the Harvard- and MIT-founded online education venture, IIT director Devang V. Khakhar signed a memorandum of understanding at the U.S.-India Higher Education Dialogue, a conference chaired by U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and India’s Human Resources Development Minister M. M. Pallam Raju.
"At edX, our global community continues to grow at the student and institutional levels," edX president Anant Agarwal said in an edX press release. "India is an important market for us and is home to the largest population of edX learners outside of the United States.”
IIT Bombay, a globally recognized public engineering institution known for its highly competitive admissions process, is part of the Indian Institutes of Technology higher education system, which has previously engaged in online learning. Similar to edX, the IIT system provides free access to courses online through its National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning. The initiative has 600 course content pages utilized by affiliates from 800 colleges across India, the Indian Express reported in December.
According to the edX statement, xIITB’s courses could potentially aid in the training of India’s teachers, particularly in cramped engineering programs in which 1.25 million students are enrolled in approximately 5,000 engineering colleges across the country.
In its own statement, IIT Bombay said that the partnership with edX will expand the scope of technology-aided learning to areas such as “vocational training, school education, and faculty empowerment.”
On the heels of last month’s addition of 15 schools to the XConsortium, the entrance of IIT Bombay brings the total number of partners to 29. Institutions contributing courses to the year-old online education platform span four continents and include universities, colleges, and an international organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after 53 years at Harvard coaching hundreds of student-athletes passing through Newell Boathouse, Harvard men’s heavyweight crew coach Harry Parker impressed many with his ability to remember graduates of his program.
“[Parker] had an incredible memory for alumni—almost a stronger memory for alumni than for his current rowers,” said James O’Connor ’13, the outgoing captain of the team. “Often we had guys come to visit and go out in the launch with him to watch practice…. This guy would show up and Harry would introduce him before we went out. He would remember all the details about them and all the other guys they rowed with.”
Parker, who died on Tuesday morning after a two-year battle with myelodysplastic syndrome, a type of blood cancer, shaped both the Harvard rowing tradition as well as the greater rowing world, leaving an indelible impression upon the young rowers he worked with. He was 77.
“Harry was our whole Harvard experience,” O’Connor said. “He is a big part of the reason why many of us came here in the first place.”
Just as legions of young talented rowers came to Cambridge to row for Parker, these same crews would return to him in adulthood. Last Sunday, alumni from the 1980 Olympic crew, a boat that was predicted to medal in Moscow but was pulled from competition due to the U.S. boycott, came together for a reunion row with their veteran coach. The 1980 boat is one of six Olympic squads that Parker coached, collecting three medals in the process.
Parker arrived in Cambridge in 1960 after rowing at the University of Pennsylvania and finishing fifth in the 1960 Olympics in the single scull. In 1963, he was promoted to head coach of the men’s heavyweight crew team.
Since then, Parker guided the Crimson to 22 undefeated regular seasons, the most recent of which came this spring, 24 Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges Sprints varsity titles and 16 official and unofficial national crowns.
“[Parker] created one of the most successful rowing programs in the country,” said men’s heavyweight assistant head coach Bill Manning. “It’s really difficult to find a year where Harvard wasn’t a factor in determining who the best was in this country.”
In addition to its success, the Parker era will be remembered for the boathouse culture he created and cultivated. Parker, who was a walk-on rower as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, fostered a unique program that welcomed walk-ons with no prior experience and rarely cut athletes because of a lack of talent.
“Harry created an environment where it’s an open door for people to come in, embrace the sport and challenge themselves to work together to rise high in the sport,” Manning said. “There are legions of graduates that have had a better Harvard undergraduate experience because of the opportunities provided for them at the boathouse.”
Parker was renowned in the world of rowing for his developments in crew as a collegiate sport. He was instrumental in the creation of the fall racing season and set the standard for off-season training.
“Up until the point that Harry became a varsity coach at Harvard, the way the training was approached had been the same for maybe 50 or 60 years,” said Steve Gladstone, the head coach at Yale and the head coach of the Harvard men’s lightweight team from 1970 to 1974. “Harry brought to it an increase in the volume of work and an increase in the intensity of the work that the athletes were expected to do.”
When, in 2011, Parker began juggling head coaching duties with treatment at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in 2011, Parker remained dedicated to mentoring his Crimson athletes.
Around Newell Boathouse, the rest of the coaching staff worked in tandem to ensure that he would be able to do what he did best, which in Manning’s words was, “work with young people and focus on the actual rowing and the actual practice time.”
Members of the team understood that Parker was facing serious health issues, but his energy masked the extent of those issues.
“Especially around racing season, rowing really was what kept him going,” O’Connor said. “Come April and May, he was just 20 years younger again.”
In a video made the Harvard Alumni Association this past fall called “Why We Row,” Parker called himself a teacher whose job was to “nurture traits that are already there within the rowers.”
In the same video, Parker, who continued to scull for exercise well after the end of his competitive rowing career, described the infectious love for rowing that once captured him.
“As soon as I started rowing, I had a feeling that this is wonderful,” Parker said. “It’s a great sense of power.… It takes people who are patient and willing to work hard and deal with a lot of frustration until they get it right. Once that happens, they’re hooked—they’re hooked for life.”
Parker is survived by his wife, Kathy Keeler, two sons, George and David, and a daughter, Abigail.
