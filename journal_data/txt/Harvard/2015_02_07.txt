“Jupiter Ascending” is incomparable to the Wachowskis’s earlier films, such as “The Matrix” and “Cloud Atlas.” The most obvious departure is that it is undeniably a teen flick, directed at a younger audience more enraptured by stunning special effects than winding and intricate storylines. But the Wachowski touch is still there: the grandeur of scope, the uplifting message, the lush visuals. As a result, the film’s failures are all the more disappointing. The Wachowskis, who have never been known to be feckless storytellers, have at times polarized audiences with their films, but the criticisms leveled at their films have labeled them as aiming too high or being somewhat inaccessible, not being incogent.
“Jupiter Ascending” is in some ways the Wachowskis’s most ambitious project yet; while other teen films such as “The Hunger Games” or “The Maze Runner” have the benefit of a world already created within a popular book series, “Jupiter Ascending” attempts to create a similarly complex universe within a standalone film, with little success. The plot of “Jupiter Ascending” is neither captivating nor sensical. The film, set in the distant future, revolves around fatherless house maid Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), whose unglamorous and menial lifestyle introduces her as a modern-day Cinderella. The story continues in the most predictable manner possible, introducing Channing Tatum as Caine Wise, a stony-faced werewolf who swoops in from the stars to change the helpless Jupiter’s destiny and crown her queen of the universe.
From the opening of the film, the one-dimensionality of its writing is its weakest point. Its two-hour runtime proves too short to establish the intricate setting the story requires; in particular, the scientific details of the film, necessary background for the rest of the movie, are never clearly elucidated. They are touched on only in an overly artificial scene in which a bewildered Jones asks Wise a series of questions that Wise answers carelessly and unintelligibly. This dialogue and others like it, although they only last for a matter of seconds, nonetheless stand out as awkward attempts to ameliorate gaps in the plot that unfortunately end up detracting from its continuity and credibility. Uncontextualized, these discrepancies appear ridiculous and completely lacking verisimilitude, exemplified by moments like one episode in which half-bee, half-human Stinger Apini (Sean Bean) takes Jupiter aside and confides without explanation, “Bees are genetically designed to sense royalty.”
The film’s weakness is further reflected in the characters. The cast is a conglomerate of tropes  from the science and teen science fiction canon: werewolves, elves, and dragons all live in relative harmony in a “Star Wars”-esque world. One of the most disappointing characters is Jupiter herself, who spends a good amount of time following the film’s fairy tale introduction being carried on Wise’s shoulders. Wise himself spends his time fighting off various villains, including the paranormal “keepers” and other extraterrestrial pursuers. The emptiness of these characters is exacerbated by unconvincing acting. In one particularly memorable scene, brothers Balem (Eddie Redmayne) and Titus (Douglas Booth) Abrasax discuss their ulterior motives in such an affected manner that they sound more absurd than malicious.
“Jupiter Ascending” makes a final, half-hearted attempt to redeem itself by flooding its viewers with flashy special effects, particularly during the its extended fight scenes. Though the scenes use the distinctive Chicago skyline, River, and architecture in a thorough and organic way, they ultimately come off as a gaudy series action film clichés rather than transitional, narrative, or even clearly sequential. The latter half of “Jupiter Ascending” is stuffed to the brim with these scenes, whose uninspired quality makes the movie drag for 127 unbearably humdrum minutes.
It is hard to say that the Wachowskis are out of their comfort zone on “Jupiter Ascending” because the film shows no restraining of their idiosyncrasies, especially in its writing. However, the transition from action thrillers to what Lana Wachowski calls “a science fiction space opera” directed at young adults is not seamless. Pressed to fit their prolific imaginations into a restrictive, teen romance formula, the duo runs out of gas in their latest work. Though the Wachowskis may yet release a movie that rivals their previous filmography in complexity and mesmerism, “Jupiter Ascending” is an unoriginal attempt to release a more palatable film, which, to Wachowski fans, may be the hardest part to stomach.

“There are still things that profoundly upset me when I encounter them…but they teach me things, and they open my eyes, and if they hurt, they hurt in ways that make me think and grow and change,” writes Neil Gaiman in the introduction to his charming third anthology of short stories. The title, “Trigger Warning: Short Fictions and Disturbances,” is rather appropriate for a writer of his literary reputation; Gaiman, famous for the “Sandman” comic book series and dark novels such as “American Gods” and “Coraline,” is an acknowledged master of worldbuilding. His fantastical constructions are shadowed by the omnipresent specter of Death. Gaiman’s obsession with mortality, coupled with his grotesque and often horrifying imagery, make strange bedfellows with his understated and whimsical narration—but this distinctive morbid optimism is what distinguishes him from other writers of the fantasy genre. Although “Trigger Warning” isn’t Gaiman at his absolute best, it’s certainly valuable as his most experimental work in fiction (with some droll interludes of poetry thrown in for good measure). Each short piece serves as an exciting foray into some macabre microcosm of his mind.
Certain stories, such as “‘The Truth Is a Cave in the Black Mountains’” and “The Sleeper and the Spindle,” are immediately distinguishable as conventional Gaiman dark fantasy but are also refreshingly new. In “The Truth,” Gaiman slowly unravels the tale of a dwarf and his companion traveling to a misty island (based on the real-life Isle of Skye in Scotland, one of Gaiman’s favorite haunts). The dwarf ostensibly wants to claim some fantastic treasure from a cursed cave, but his fellow traveler soon realizes that more sinister motives are at play. “The Sleeper” is Gaiman’s mash-up of “Sleeping Beauty” and “Snow White” in which Snow White journeys to a neighboring kingdom to lift it from a mysterious sleeping curse, the source of which is a thorn-encrusted royal castle of sleeping victims guarded by a menacing old woman. In the hands of another writer, such stories might have turned out trite or derivative, but Gaiman manages to subvert fantasy tropes and conventional plot expectations, as he has before in “Stardust." He doesn’t hesitate to portray the graphic—in "The Truth," a character grimly recounts, “I saw it in my mind’s eye: her skeleton picked clean of clothes, picked clean of flesh, as naked and white as anyone would ever be, hanging like a child’s puppet against the thornbush, tied to a branch above it by its red-golden hair.” Elsewhere, in the seemingly traditional princess story of "The Sleeper," he makes progressive political statements: “She touched the pink lips to her own carmine lips and she kissed the sleeping girl long and hard.”
“Trigger Warning” is at its best when Gaiman renders perception untrustworthy and blurs the line between reality and fantasy, often to disturbing results. Two stories stand out as examples of this narrative unreliability: “Click-Clack the Rattlebag” reads as a surprisingly fast-paced children’s horror tale while “The Thing About Cassandra” takes a serious, adult perspective on modern romance. It’s a testament to Gaiman’s versatility that he exhibits so many different styles of writing in this single anthology, from the heavy dialogue of “Click-Clack” to the contemporary sensibilities of the narration in “Cassandra.” This flexibility wanders into experimental territory with stories such as “ORANGE” and “A Calendar of Tales.” The former is structured as a numbered list of answers to a police interrogation (questions helpfully omitted), while “Calendar” is a series of 12 vignettes about the months of the year, inspired by suggestions that Gaiman solicited over Twitter.
Gaiman is also good at blurring genre boundaries in his stories. Two of his more conventional stories—“The Case of Death and Honey” and “Nothing O’Clock”—deftly pay homage to pop culture icons. “Death and Honey” is a cleverly imagined Sherlock Holmes narrative that channels Gaiman’s obsession with death and immortality through the neurotic first-person narration of the famous detective. “As my face grew unfamiliar, and my finger-joints swelled and ached…and as Watson, dear, brave, obtuse Watson, faded with time and paled and shrank, his skin becoming grayer, his moustache becoming the same shade of gray as his skin, my resolve to conclude my researches did not diminish,” Holmes muses.One might think that similar worries preoccupy Gaiman given the pervasiveness of such themes throughout his body of work. In “Nothing O’Clock,” Gaiman tells the opposite story—one of an immortal alien known as The Doctor, a being for whom mortality is no question at all. Having previously written two episodes for the 2005 BBC revival of “Doctor Who,” Gaiman revisits the character of the Eleventh Doctor in this tale. Given his familiarity with the characters and experience writing for the television show, it's no surprise that Gaiman very accurately captures the idiosyncrasies of The Doctor and his companion Amy Pond, to the point where one can almost hear the voices of their respective actors reading the dialogue. This story alone, along with “An Invocation of Incuriosity” which ingeniously applies fantasy sensibilities to a science fiction story about time travel, could secure Gaiman in the upper echelons of contemporary science fiction and speculative fiction writers.
While “Trigger Warning” might disturb some with its everyday approach to the macabre, it crucially highlights Gaiman’s creative finesse in a medium that allows for more experimental and intellectually interesting exploration. Gaiman is a writer known for works that span many different mediums—most significantly long and dark fantasy novels—but this anthology, much like his first, allows him to employ unique ideas and styles that only function well in a short format. Perhaps no caution is necessary for those familiar with Gaiman’s work—though “Trigger Warning” will still find a way to catch the reader off guard.

UPDATED: February 9, 2015, at 12:34 a.m.
The total value of gifts and pledges to the Harvard’s capital campaign has reached $5 billion, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers '74 said Friday.
The $5 billion figure comprises nearly 300,000 gifts from 100,000 households, according to Rogers.
“It’s a really broadly gauged campaign with a lot of participation,” Rogers said. “You tend to read about the gifts that come in like [Kenneth] Griffin’s for financial aid, but it’s a comprehensive effort so we have a lot of people who are participating.”
In September 2013, the University publicly launched its capital campaign—which had already taken in $2.8 billion in gifts and pledges in its “quiet” phase—with the goal of raising $6.5 billion. That figure, if raised, would top Stanford’s $6.2 billion campaign and be the most valuable fundraising drive in the history of higher education.
Last fiscal year alone, the University raised $1.16 billion in gifts, setting a record for the largest amount of gifts in a single year and beating out Stanford in fundraising for the first time since 2004, according to a survey by the Council for Aid to Education.
Notably, last calendar year, hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 donated $150 million, with at least $125 million of the gift directed to supporting financial aid at the College, and Gerald L. Chan donated $350 million to the School of Public Health. For their support, Griffin received the namesake for the financial aid office and the School of Public Health has been renamed in honor of Chan’s late father.
Rogers emphasized that alumni from Harvard’s more prominent schools have taken leadership roles in the campaigns of schools that traditionally have more trouble fundraising.
“I think another surprise…is the number of alums from the College and the Business School who have taken interest in other parts of Harvard and have been willing to make significant commitments,” Rogers said.
Forty-five percent of the capital campaign is directed toward teaching and research, 25 percent to financial aid and “the student experience,” 20 percent to capital improvements, and the remaining 10 percent will serve as “flexible funding to foster collaborations and initiatives.” Rogers said $590 million has been raised for financial aid across the University.

UPDATED: February 8, 2015, at 10:15 p.m.
Actor Chris Pratt displayed good humor and versatility Friday night at Farkas Hall, chopping wood with his forehead and performing a lap dance as he was honored and roasted as the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year.
Pratt, known for his roles in the comedy television series “Parks and Recreation” and last year’s box office successes “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “The Lego Movie,” had to fend off “ghosts of movies past”—members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals dressed up as characters from his past movies—before he received the signature “Pudding Pot” award.
Audience members at the sold out event first watched Hasty Pudding Theatricals co-producers and emcees Joshua J. Friedman ’16 and Zoe B. Rosenthal ’16 mock Pratt’s career failures and successes.
“He stars in ‘Parks and Recreation’ as Andy Dwyer, a goofy but dim-witted guy. Who knew he was a method actor?” Rosenthal said.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals cast members paraded in turn onto the stage, challenging Pratt to complete various tasks. Pratt gamely chopped up wood with his hand and then his forehead, sang off-key, and gave a lap dance to Matthew W. G. Walker ’16, a Hasty Pudding cast member dressed as a female character from the movie Her, in which Pratt played a small part, during the roast.
“How beautiful was she? I had a tingle, I’m not going to lie,” Pratt said afterwards about the lap dance.
At a press conference following the award ceremony, he called the roast “a lot of fun.”
“The whole thing was a blast and a riot,” he said.
Pratt fielded light-hearted questions, picking Captain America as his favorite superhero from among three choices, which included past characters he had played.
“Shoot, I’ve known about Captain America since I was four,” he said.
When asked how he felt about losing a Super Bowl bet, wagered on Twitter, against actor Chris Evans, who plays superhero Captain America, he joked that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady “is the greatest quarterback so far,” but said Brady was “soon to be eclipsed by [Seattle Seahawks quarterback] Russell Wilson.”
He then set joking aside to discuss his visit to see sick children at Christopher's Haven in Boston with Chris Evans on Friday morning, the wager of their bet, noting that he hopes to continue such visits in the future.
He also offered advice those pursuing an acting career.
“More belief than desire is the key, because there’s a lot of people who desperately want to pursue their dream, whatever it is, and there are people who believe it’s theirs, ” he said.
Pratt’s visit follows that of his “Parks and Recreation” co-star Amy Poehler, who was honored as the Hasty Pudding’s woman of the year in late January.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 8, 2015
An earlier verison of this article misquoted Zoe B. Rosenthal ’16. Rosenthal referred to "Parks and Recreation" character Andy Dwyer as a "goofy but dim-witted," not "lovable," guy.

NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Powered by over three points per game from the junior forward pairing of Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo, the No. 6/6 Harvard men’s ice hockey team entered Friday with the fourth highest scoring offense in the country, averaging 3.7 goals per game.
But in a visit to Ingalls Rink, a venue in which the Crimson (12-7-2, 8-5-2 ECAC) has not won since 2005, the top liners were given little room with which to work. Together, Vesey and Criscuolo mustered just four shots, as Harvard failed to find its rhythm on offense, ultimately falling to Yale, 3-0.
After generating just four shots in the first period, the No. 15/15 Bulldogs (13-6-3, 8-5-2) came out flying in the second. Junior forward Stu Wilson got Yale on the board with a powerful wrister from the right wing in the opening minutes of the frame, shifting momentum in the Bulldogs' favor.
Following an array of Yale scoring chances over the remainder of the period, the Bulldogs finally came away with something to show for their consistent attack when sophomore forward Chris Izmirlian received a pass in the slot in the frame's closing minutes.
Izmirlian lifted his stick, prompting the Crimson to take the bait and send an extra defenseman to defend the shot. But Izmirlian had other ideas. The sophomore instead delivered a pass to an open John Hayden, who tapped the puck past junior goaltender Steve Michalek from the right post to double the Bulldog lead.
“That [goal] hurt,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “That hurt because we had some chances, we killed some penalties off, and [we] had some good saves and good blocked shots. But we needed to keep [the defecit] within one.”
Yale goaltender Alex Lyon provided more than enough validity to that claim, anchoring the Bulldogs with 24 saves in his seventh career shutout, a new school record. The sophomore has allowed just two goals in three games to the Crimson this season, racking up a .975 save percentage over that span.
In the loss, Vesey was held off the score sheet for the first time this season, bringing his streak of 20 consecutive games with a point to an end.
Vesey had four shots on the night, but the Bulldog blue line did everything Yale coach Keith Allain could have asked. The junior found himself on the receiving end of two passes through the crease from Criscuolo and sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot, but the Bulldog backcheck had an answer each time, getting multiple sticks in the way of the Harvard first line’s bread and butter.
“I thought we had some chances to put a couple pucks in the net tonight,” co-captain Max Everson said. “It’s probably a different game if we score a goal in the [first or second period], but I think we started to get away from our game plan a little bit, started to play into their hands.”
After its strong defensive performance in the opening frame, the Crimson watched Yale flip the game around in the second, as the Bulldogs began to frustrate the Harvard attack, which had been building the bulk of its chances out of its own zone. As a result, Yale went on to outshoot the Crimson, 14-5, in the frame.
“As the game wore on, they won more races to pucks and won more battles,” Donato said. “We made a few mistakes on their goals, but really the story of the game was that they outbattled us and outcompeted us.”
Harvard tried to climb back into the game in the third, but Lyon held his ground, sending aside all 11 shots he faced. The Crimson hit two posts, with sophomore forward Sean Malone ringing the iron from high in the slot and junior forward Brian Hart nearly connecting on a poke down low, but Harvard could never find the back of the net.
Fresh off a record-breaking Beanpot performance in which he made 63 saves, Michalek made 32 stops on the night, keeping his team alive when the Bulldogs were on the brink of blowing the game open in the second. Yale’s final score came after the junior had already vacated his net.
Despite Michalek’s recent success, the Crimson is now just 2-6-0 since the start of the new year, having lost its third straight game for the first time all season. On the flip side, the Bulldogs move into a tie with Harvard for third in the conference, seven points behind No. 16/- Quinnipiac and four behind St. Lawrence.
“[Harvard and Yale] are two teams that want to be around when the dust clears at the end,” Donato said. “We know they’re a good hockey team, and we hope that we get a chance to play them somewhere ahead because we expect they’ll be somewhere in the mix. And we hope to be.”

PROVIDENCE, R.I.—With Harvard down two and just ticks remaining on the clock, both teams knew where the ball was heading: into the hands of senior wing Wesley Saunders, the Crimson’s go-to man who had truly done it all for the Harvard men’s basketball team through nearly 40 minutes of play on Friday night.
So it was no surprise when Saunders caught the ball on the left wing, putting his head down and forcing his way into the paint. He stopped on a dime at the right block, laying up the contested shot over the outstretched arms of his Brown defender.
And missed.
But on a night when seemingly everything went Saunders’s way, so too did the ball with just a second to play. The rock ended up back in his hands, and, a moment later, was sliding through the net as the final horn sounded, sending the two teams to overtime.
In the extra period, the Crimson (14-5, 4-1 Ivy) never trailed, knocking down seven free throws in the final minutes to seal a 76-74 win over Brown (9-13, 0-5) at the Pizzitola Sports Center in what, on paper at least, was supposed to be an easy game.
“Another Ivy League battle,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought both teams really fought and competed to win this basketball game. It was very, very difficult for us…. Obviously the difference for us was Wesley Saunders—the way he played inspired basketball to get the ball to the basket.”
Saunders’s 33-point night was a career best, and the Crimson needed every one of them to hold back an aggressive Bears team.
While Harvard maintained control in the first period—at one point going on a 12-2 run—the team was held scoreless for the first 5:53 after intermission, tallying seven turnovers and a pair of missed layups before scoring a single second-half point.
Brown took advantage. Going on a 9-0 run in that same span of time, the Bears erased their deficit and took a three-point lead, setting up a fight to the finish that featured seven lead changes before regulation was over, with no team able to take more than a four-point advantage until the extra period.
A Saunders three pointer with one second left on the shot clock that put his team up, 51-49, with 8:12 to play appeared to give the Crimson momentum, but six Brown free throws in the following minutes tied things up at 55 apiece with 3:22 remaining.
From there, it effectively became a two-man battle between Saunders and the Bears’ sophomore guard Tavon Blackmon. A spinning lay-in from Saunders on the subsequent possession was matched by a clock-beating lefty layup from Blackmon, keeping the score tied, 57-all.
And, after a series of free throws from both sides, it was Blackmon who was sent to the line with the score tied, and 8.8 seconds left, to try to win the game for his squad.
The sophomore made just one of two from the stripe, however, setting up Saunders’s game-tying put-back layup, silencing the Brown fans’ chant of “Harvard: solve this. Harvard: solve this.”
Blackmon would score eight of his team’s 10 points in overtime, but the collective effort from the Crimson’s lineup proved too much for the underdogs. A rebound bobbled out of the Bears’ hands with just two seconds remaining, leaving Blackmon screaming with disappointment as time expired.
For the game, the Brown guard notched career highs in both points (25) and assists (nine), shooting 7-of-12 from the field on a night when his team shot at only a 41.8 percent clip.
“I just wanted to win,” Blackmon explained. “I just wanted to win real bad, so I just tried to do whatever I could to help our team win.”
Both Amaker and Brown coach Mike Martin cited Blackmon’s play as the difference-maker for the Bears, despite the final score.
“I thought his penetration, his ability to get to the rim and make plays, [all of that] put pressure on our defense,” Amaker said. “It was just tremendous the effort he played with.”
On the other side of the floor, accompanying Saunders’s breakout 33-point, 10-rebound performance, senior forward Jonah Travis and junior wing Agunwa Okolie each contributed 11 points, while a coterie of big men—including co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, junior Evan Cummins, and sophomore Zena Edosomwan—spent time on the floor trying to hold back Brown’s Cedric Kuakumensah. Kuakumensah finished the game with 15 points and four blocks, hitting several of his team’s key jumpers and free throws to tighten the contest down the stretch.
Friday’s overtime marked the third straight year in which Harvard’s game at Brown went into extra periods. For Amaker, the grind-out nature of these contests suggests that in the Ancient Eight, no win is guaranteed.
“We’ve had these types of games against Brown—they’re a tough basketball team matchup for us,” Amaker said. “They’ve played us incredibly hard and well, and we’ve been fortunate in the past and we were fortunate again tonight…. We have a great deal of respect for what Brown has done this season and…[they] are one possession away from looking a lot different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—For the majority of the first 18 minutes of Friday night’s contest at the Pizzitola Sports Center, the Harvard men’s basketball team (14-5, 4-1 Ivy) nursed a double-digit lead over Brown (9-13, 0-5).
Nonetheless, just before the end of the first half, the Bears closed the gap to six. As Brown clawed its way back into the contest, the Crimson eventually relinquished the lead, needing overtime to earn the 76-74 win on the road.
SUPER SAUNDERS
Senior wing Wesley Saunders is one of the Ivy League’s biggest enigmas. The reigning Ivy League player of the year, Saunders has the ability to do it all on the floor, as he stuffs the stat sheet on a nightly basis.
Saunders can be elite in all facets of the game. Sometimes, it is his passing (see his eight dimes on multiple occasions); other times his rebounding (like his 12 boards versus Holy Cross); and even at times his defending (note his seven steals against Vermont). Friday though, he did what he does best: score.
“[Saunders] getting a double-double, getting that big layup—the offensive rebound and basket that…put the game in overtime for us [was key],” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
From draining a three pointer off the opening whistle to scoring five of his team’s 12 in overtime, Saunders put on a show all night. The senior finished the night with 33 points (a career high) to go along with 10 rebounds, three assists, and three blocks.
As the shot clock wound down with eight minutes to play and his team down one, Saunders surveyed the floor. No one was open. Calmly, coolly, and with little effort, the senior knocked down a three with a man in his face as the buzzer sounded.
That would not be the last of Saunders’ buzzer-beating heroics.
With the Crimson trailing by two and only eight ticks left, Saunders showed why he is arguably the most prolific scorer in the Ancient Eight.
Saunders caught the ball on the left wing, slashed to the hoop, and missed the layup. Nonetheless, the veteran grabbed the rebound and put the ball right back up, tying the game as the clock expired.
BENCH BUDDIES
While Amaker may only be able to put five players on the floor at a time, senior forward Jonah Travis and sophomore guard Corbin Miller have certainly made a strong case for adding two more.
“Jonah and Corbin are two kids that we consider our sixth and seventh starters,” Amaker said. “Jonah in particular being a senior for us, coming off the bench. That’s his role—to bring energy and effort from the post player position—and he’s done it incredibly well for us.”
Coming off the bench, Miller and Travis played 31 and 24 minutes, respectively. While Travis provided the offensive spark down low, Miller took over the reigns at the point while Chambers was on the bench.
“I think Jonah Travis and Corbin Miller are two huge keys to their success,” Brown coach Mike Martin said. “They come off the bench, and they accept their roles.”
Travis was a force on the offensive boards, repeatedly pulling down the rock and then drawing the ensuing foul. Travis’ ability to keep possessions alive clearly deflated a Brown squad that was feeding off of the energy of its home crowd.
“Travis was huge,” Martin said. “He had some huge offensive rebounds, some huge baskets. [He] brings great energy [and] toughness to their team.”
The senior finished the night with 11 points, five rebounds, and two blocks.
Meanwhile, while Miller may have only finished with five points, his ability to run the point and only turn the ball over once was crucial. In addition, the sophomore knocked down two clutch free throws with 24 seconds remaining in overtime to put the contest out of reach.
TALE OF TWO HALVES
For the opening 16 and a half minutes of the first half, Harvard had a big zero on its stat sheet: zero turnovers, that is. The Crimson finished the first half with only two turnovers, as junior co-captain Siyani Chambers took care of the ball masterfully.
While Harvard may have recorded no statistical “fast break” points in the first half, Chambers was constantly pushing the ball and finding secondary cutters in transition. Turnovers have plagued Harvard for much of the year, so Chambers’ ability to be a true floor general was a key component of its six-point lead heading into the half.
But something changed at the break.
Before it could even score a point in the second half, the Crimson had committed seven turnovers. Chambers was not even the culprit.
First, sophomore Zena Edosomwan coughed the ball up twice. Then, it was Saunders and co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi with back-to-back traveling violations.
Next, Edosomwan and Saunders each turned the ball over once more. Amid all the sloppy play, Harvard went six minutes without a point until Saunders knocked down a free throw.
Brown took advantage of Harvard’s miscues, as it was 41-37 before the Crimson could even manage a field goal. Harvard finished the night with 14 total turnovers but limited itself to only one in overtime.
