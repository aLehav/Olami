“And in the dark I’ll be your eyes,” sings British indie rock band Amber Run on “Hurt,” the second track of “How To Be Human,” released on Feb. 24. With vulnerable piano ballads and upbeat, dreamy pop-rock tracks alongside their classic cinematic alt-rock sound, the album candidly explores the human experience in all its facets. Through Amber Run’s eyes, the listener experiences the bittersweet and anything but linear journey of losing and finding, laughing and crying, loving and longing, as they suggest that life is so beautiful because we “have never truly understood / how to be human.”
“Hurt,” the album’s second track, showcases Amber Run’s lyricism, the brilliance of which often lies in its ambiguity.
“Don't think that there's a medicine / For what is going 'round / Fight it with your vitamins / I've heard it knocks you out / And it goes 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round / Until it's yours.”
The song never tells us what is “going ‘round,” but the resulting “hurt” seems to be an inevitable part of the human experience. The water metaphor emphasized through reverb keyboard instrumentals take the listener underwater. The repetition of “‘round and ‘round and ‘round and ‘round,” which is picked up in the bridge with the addition of background vocals, portrays a sonic maelstrom of hurt that pulls the listener in. After a small pause, the song plunges into depths in the chorus, utilizing bass, low vocals, and heavy percussion, yet getting to the depth of it all has interestingly become the most hopeful part of the song: “When the water pulls you under / I'll wrap my arms around you / I'll hold you while you cry / And in the dark I'll be your eyes.” In addition to this being a heart-warming message to their fans, Amber Run have managed to masterfully combine both lyrics and sonics to show that even though painful experiences have the potential to drown you, getting to the depth of a problem can also illuminate who you are and who you want to be.
The album then ventures into the realm of love with “I Hope It’s Not Like This Forever,” an infectious joy of a song with an addictive melody. Describing the early stages of infatuation, of meeting someone at a Friday night dance party and hoping that you’ll get to know them better, this song depicts its setting so well that the listener can dance along to the keyboard instrumental. Yet in concordance with the rest of the album, the song contains a bittersweet undercurrent, particularly in one of the album’s most thought-provoking lines: “I can't be the only one / Unsatisfied and wanting more / Than playing understudy / In my own dark comedy.” Through these lyrics, Amber Run touch on the feeling of estrangement from one’s own life, as if somebody else was living it. Seen in this context, falling in love is certainly one of those feelings that make you feel most alive and least like you are “playing understudy.”
The counterpart to this song about new love is “The Last Dance,” a tender, raw ballad about wanting to be someone’s life partner: “Could I have the last dance?” lead vocalist Joe Keogh asks, again and again, with stunning vulnerability. It is not only one of the finest songs Amber Run has produced, but Keogh also delivers one of his strongest vocal performances in a slow burn intensification of the soaring melodic line.
“Funeral,” a somber piano ballad filled with beautiful melodic lines and disorienting reverb, is the album’s darkest song. “Gone are the young before they're old / Echoing / The world they're in / Where flying looks a lot like falling,” Keogh sings, before he pleads “No, not another funeral” over and over in the chorus. This song certainly speaks to losing a loved one, yet there seems to be more to it: “What a way to live / What a state we're in / Where it's a mistake to show emotion,” refers to our society which often makes us repress “negative” emotions like sadness or anger, thereby taking us further away from ourselves. Perhaps “Funeral” is about the death of certain parts within us, a mourning of one’s lost childhood: “I wish I hadn’t let you go.”
The life-death metaphor continues in “Honeylight,” now in the sphere of light-darkness. After a disillusioned opening accompanied by spare, nostalgic guitar strokes — “There’s nothing to it / You just exist / Then you die” — “Honeylight” quickly turns into one of the album’s most inspirational songs, comparing life to the golden hour before sunrise or sunset. The tempo picks up and playful guitar and piano instrumentals create a warm and sweet atmosphere as Keogh sings, “I would like to bathe in honey / In honeylight.” Life is so precious because we “just exist, then die,” its brevity heightens all our experiences. Just like the golden hour before it gets dark, Amber Run create pure magic and transform a disenchanted realization into genuine enchantment with life.
Encapsulating the album, the title song depicts the strange, paradoxical experience of being human through lyrics like “To have never truly understood / How to be human,”and “To never truly know your mind / Is how to be human.” In their most holistic and mature approach to the existential search of meaning yet, Amber Run conclude that though we may learn and search all we want, to “truly” understand might simply be out of reach. At least, there is certainly not any one answer — instead, they depict the full range of life’s unpredictable currents — there’s hurt and joy, there’s love and death and setbacks — and remind us that we would do well in swimming with, not against them.

Last summer, the first chapter of Esther Yi’s debut novel “Y/N” was published in The Paris Review under the title “Moon,” the name of the member of a Korean pop supergroup who becomes the object of the unnamed narrator’s obsession. At the chapter’s white-hot center is an extended, ekphrastic episode in which the narrator neurotically describes Moon’s movements and physical attributes at a concert. Though this scene takes up some eight pages, the pacing never lags thanks to the freshness of the language, which borders on the sublime — in one riotously transgressive moment, the narrator imagines Moon’s throat as “a fundamental muscle that ran down the body all the way to the groin, where, I imagined, it boldly flipped out as the penis.”
As a novel, however, “Y/N” finds itself incompatible with the stark instantaneity of Yi’s prose. Following the concert by the supergroup (whom the narrator calls “the pack of boys”), the narrator watches Moon’s live streams, leaves her boyfriend, writes a fanfiction story featuring Moon, and attends a party hosted by the fandom at a Berlin café. Later she moves to Seoul, where she visits the boys’ pyramidal residential complex and ends up in a haven outside the city called the Sanctuary, where Moon is living alongside three patients with dementia.
Stretched between so many continents and interiors, the narrator’s frenetic desire for Moon, which was the first chapter’s lifeblood, now wears thin; its potency is foiled by logistics. The narrator’s search for meaning leads her toward irrelevant details and dead-end plot lines; As a result, the book often feels like a big, cantilevered Jenga tower — constructed in earnest but teetering, and ready at any moment to collapse.
The novel’s title stands for “your name” a reference to the trope in modern fanfiction where the narrator’s name is replaced by those two letters, in an invitation to the reader to supplant their own identity as a character in the story. This device, however symbolic of the narrator’s habit of projection, seems only to be directly employed within the embedded story that she writes. The rest of “Y/N” fails to achieve that standard of devotion and immersiveness, which is key to all good fanfiction.
This failure may be due to Yi’s refusal to lean into clichés, which sabotages the novel when taken to the extreme. Her narrator is, frankly, a snob, completely disinterested in the universal or the commonly felt. Narratorial snobbishness is a common trait in much contemporary fiction, but Yi’s narrator considers even the simple relaying of a thought or emotion to be beneath her, such that every instance of narrative elaboration or conversation carries the pedantic, convoluted speech of a proselytizer or conspiracy theorist.
What problematizes the novel’s narrative voice is not how it presents the narrator’s over-discerning taste (which is actually one of her more redeeming qualities), but how it characterizes the text overall. “Y/N” is an attempt to innovate within the fanfiction genre, which can sometimes encourage adherence to one formula. Yi’s cause is a noble one, but its poor execution causes it to confound where it seeks to convince.
The novel’s dialogue is perhaps the most egregious example of Yi’s innovative shortcomings. In Chapter Six, the narrator meets a woman named O, whose identity she later assumes in order to gain entrance to Polygon Plaza — the hulking, pyramid-shaped complex where the pack of boys live and record music, under the guidance of a mysterious woman called the Music Professor. (It’s all very Willy Wonka.) Before all this, in O’s apartment, O leans over to sniff the narrator. She gags, then says, “You smell like a lovely tree, but you look like an emergency room patient who will never be the same.” The dialogue here is wholly misguided, less a mimesis of human speech than a vague, unintelligible gesture toward the transcendent.
The narrator’s character, too, is confounding — she often makes choices incongruous to her character that restrict her believability as a person. The novel’s first chapters provide a vehement defense of her volatile, disordered interiority — why, then, does she so readily agree to be therapized later in the novel? These contradictions twist the story into a disorienting spiral, plumbing deeper and deeper into its own unsure arguments. The reader is not invited below the surface.
“Y/N” is at its best when it doesn’t try to do too much, drawing on preestablished practices of storytelling instead of gesticulating toward something new. At times, the novel employs austerity in moments of description, reminiscent of Katie Kitamura’s “Intimacies.” Another section, at the end of Chapter Seven, evokes the meta-structures of framing that frequently figure in the work of Lydia Davis. But when “Y/N” veers away from contemporary convention in a bold but bungled attempt at generic trailblazing, it seems to get lost.

Colors, lights, song, dance: Ghungroo has them all. Celebrating its 35th anniversary, the student-led production, titled “Facets” this year, had four showings between Thursday March 2 and Saturday March 5. Every performance was sold out.
Within Ghungroo, there were eight genres of dance and 38 different scenes. Moreover, each song, poem, dance, or skit was exciting and distinct in its own way. As a result, Ghungroo was able to cohesively illustrate the richness and complexities of South Asian cultures.
Director Shraddha Joshi ’24 reflects on how Ghungroo has evolved to express such diversity over its history.
“35 years ago, Ghungroo was a place to sort of put South Asia on the map and get it out there to people who didn't know anything about the culture or anything about the community. But now, 35 years on, I think those dynamics have changed a lot and we have a lot of South Asians on campus. We have people from a range of different identities,” Joshi said. “It's really become a matter of thinking about how we can try to uplift and give a platform to people beyond the identities that are most hegemonic.”
Ghungroo is a show that allows those of South Asian identities to express and share their experiences and customs. Ishan Tiwari ’24, an international student from Nepal, took the opportunity to be involved.
To Tiwari, Ghungroo means “being able to highlight your culture, showcase your talent, or anything that you like to people know about. For Nepal, not many people know about it, and not many people know that it's in South Asia as well.”
Tiwari performed in both the Nepali music and dance acts, which explored three unique styles of dance: Tamang, Sakela, and Tappa. Along with the distinctive forms, the Nepali dance showcased three types of clothing emblematic of their respective cultural communities.
Ghungroo has also been an opportunity for Tiwari to learn more about other cultural backgrounds.
“So I met many people from different backgrounds, from different countries, and different regions of the U.S. I don't think I would have met them otherwise, you know. I became friends with them,” Tiwari shared.
Although Ghungroo is a celebration of South Asian cultures, it is not exclusive to South Asian identities.
Abiba Imam Dyuti ’24 said, “You'll see people from all sorts of races and ethnicities coming and performing on the Ghungroo stage. And that, I think, allows us to appreciate our culture in a different way, allows them to view our culture in a different way because participating in our cultural activities is very different from watching it.”
Whether participating in the production or not, the show is truly immersive for both viewer and performer. In Dyuti’s spoken word act in Bengali, she was able to express all of the sentiments in the poem “Ami Sei Meye,” or “I Am That Girl” by Bengali poet Subho Dasgupta.
Dyuti spoke in powerful fluctuations, gestures, and expressions, invoking frustration, rage, and ultimately self-celebration. Even though most of the audience is unfamiliar with Bengali, her vivid and inflaming oratory skills painted all that the poem has to say.
To be able to share this outside of her home in Bangladesh brought Dyuti and her listeners great pleasure.
“I never thought my South Asian heritage was something I would be able to proudly show to non-South Asian people. There were things I used to be embarrassed to show non-Desi people, but coming here and realizing how much people love watching our performing arts has made me realize that I don’t need to keep it hidden, and it makes me really happy,” Dyuti said.
Other complexities of identity arise from the history of these regions. Punjab, India, for instance, contains immense cultural richness and diversity, but its past is haunted by colonialism and religious persecution. Sahaj Singh ’23 navigated these topics in his spoken word piece “Sukkaab: Stories from the Land of Five Rivers” at Ghungroo.
“When it came to my own self introduction of identity, I feel like I've always felt quite close to the place that I am from. But the place I come from is riddled with inconsistencies and questions that have made it difficult to see it as something that's stable,” Sahaj said.
All these additions to Ghungroo add social potency to the cultural celebration.
“There's so much to celebrate and there's so much beauty. There's all these colors, melodies, costumes, but I think often in that we choose to potentially distance ourselves from some of the more difficult dynamics” Joshi said. “I think that part of what we really envisioned for this year's theme, which is ‘Facets,’ is grappling with that and sitting with that uncomfortableness.”
Ultimately, that is exactly what Ghungroo accomplished. With its cohesive fusion of riveting dances, stirring songs, and poignant poems, the production was a festival of culture and identity.
Dyuti summarizes the show perfectly: “It’s just so much fun.”

Sold out for over four months, The Beth’s performance on Feb. 28 at the Sinclair was brilliant. Hailing from Auckland, New Zealand, the band is in high demand across North America, touring for their latest album, 2022’s “Expert In A Dying Field.”
Fans were drawn in from the first moments with opener Sidney Gish. Gish’s easy and comedic manner had the crowd laughing, and she teased them leading up to The Beths’ entrance: “There is an excellent set piece that will soon reveal itself to you with the changeover, and I don’t want to do spoilers and say what it is, but it’s the best thing ever.”
It did not take long for the giant fish, prominently featured on the cover of “Expert In A Dying Field,” to appear on the stage in blow-up form, emerging behind guitarist Jonathan Pearce during their opening song “Future Me Hates Me.” Later, the name for the fish was selected from the crowd. Contenders included Trout, Chicken, Barnaby, and the undeniable winner, Sidney Fish, which earned a cheer and a “someone got it, well done!” from Pearce.
“Expert In A Dying Field,” is The Beths’ third album. The band feels refreshingly genuine, made up of a collection of people who seem to care deeply about music while making space to have fun and create unique experiences for their fans. Vocalist, guitarist, and main songwriter Elizabeth Stokes said of the album in an interview with The Forty-Five, “I want it to feel like a comfortable friend.”
Stokes’s songwriting makes it easy for listeners to find a friend in The Beths’ instantly comforting music. The songs from “Expert In A Dying Field” impressively balance a musically upbeat tone with lyrics that are honest reflections on the hardships that mark daily life — the insecurities and struggles that are felt by every person.
The Beths are described by Carpark Records, the label with whom they released “Experts In A Dying Field,” as continuing their “cerebral indie-rock-meets-power-pop” sound from earlier albums with “an electric shock of new confidence.” The Beths are at home with artists like Alvvays, Frankie Cosmos, and Soccer Mommy. This particular niche of the indie-rock scene is filled with artists who write pensive and often brooding songs, with vocals that feel ethereal. The Beths stand out for their instrumentals, which feel sunny, rather than relying on more somber digital effects.
The show included songs from across the bands’ three albums, including “When You Know You Know” and “Silence Is Golden” from “Expert In A Dying Field,” “I’m Not Getting Excited” from 2020’s “Jump Rope Gazers,” and a fan favorite, “Little Death,” which was their last song of the night from 2018’s “Future Me Hates Me.”
The set was filled with bits from the foursome, one of the highlights being when drummer Tristan Deck revealed “that underneath Ben’s shoes he is wearing socks with individual toes for comfort, stability, and maximum rock.” Bassist Benjamin Sinclair told the audience, “I can wiggle my toes around the whole gig, and I didn’t think anyone would know about it. But, I’m glad that we all know now.”
Sinclair enthusiastically promoted his blog and corresponding Instagram account on stage, where he keeps daily tabs on the food and activities undertaken by the band while on tour. In one of two blog posts about Cambridge, he reflected on what it was like to play at The Sinclair, which he calls his “namesake venue.” He described the experience as being “very good. As you might imagine, lots of things had my name on them. Items, and bits of building. But I didn’t get any special privileges, and that was fine.”
The Beths will continue on their North America tour throughout March, and will move on to tour Europe beginning in May. In late September and early October they will appear on tour with Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service. Great things will undoubtedly follow for this outstanding band. Those who shared an evening with The Beths at the Sinclair as February wound to an end should count themselves lucky.

Following a successful 2022 tour, the British band Gorillaz are back with their eighth studio album, “Cracker Island,” released Feb. 24. Since entering the music scene in 1998, English musician Damon Albarn and graphic artist Jamie Hewlett forged a unique identity and distinctive signature sound which skirts both rap and alternative rock. Among the first of its kind, this groundbreaking “virtual band” is composed of four fictional, animated members (2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs) each with their own elaborate backstories. On “Cracker Island,” the band showcases an — admittedly eclectic — bunch of collaborations featuring the likes of Bad Bunny, Tame Impala and Stevie Nicks. Yet, “Cracker Island” also manages to capture the psychedelic and indulgent weirdness Gorillaz fans love.
Released as the album’s leading single on June 22, 2022 and featuring American bassist and songwriter Thundercat, “Cracker Island” transports listeners to an uncanny paradise. The mysterious “forever cult” of this song’s music video serves to introduce the album’s storyline. While super-fans can obsess over the intricacies of the fandom lore, listeners do not need to be so well-versed to appreciate the creative musicality of the album.
With distorted vocals and dynamic electronic beats, standout single “Skinny Ape” is reminiscent of some of Gorillaz biggest hits like “Rhinestone Eyes” and “Clint Eastwood.” Beginning with a folksy guitar riff before layering synthesizer tracks on top, “Skinny Ape” feels simultaneously familiar — with distinct similarities to the 2010 album, “Plastic Beach” — but is different enough from past hits to be exciting. With each repetition of the chorus, the tempo and background music becomes more frenetic, culminating in an amalgamation of shrill voice effects and thrumming bass.
The album, and its overarching story comes to life through its collaborative tracks. In “Tormenta,” Bad Bunny warps the idea of a pristine island paradise, noting “the sun in the sky,” while in the background, “someone is crying,” creating a dissociation from the heavenly illusion. Later in the album, Gorillaz merges Tame Impala’s dreamy hypnoticism and rap interludes from Bootie Brown in the standout single “New Gold.” The single quickly became the breakout hit of the album, accumulating over 70 million streams on Spotify since its release on Aug. 31.
Perhaps most impressively, Gorillaz perfectly incorporates the style of legendary singer, songwriter, and producer Stevie Nicks on “Oil,” despite their vastly different bodies of work. The two artists’ vocals blend together with a resonant, echo-like effect so that neither dominates the track, but rather wafts in and out creating haunting harmonies.
Among the many star-studded collaborations, solo tracks such as “Baby Queen” and “The Tired Influencer” showcase Gorillaz’s creative experimentation and promise future innovation. Whether using samples of Siri to interact with the lyrical verses and bring to light a strangely nostalgic view of our technological age, or alluding to mythological stories about the figure Garuda, Gorillaz cultivates both a sense of obscurity and a peculiar depth of meaning. Both songs build a synthesized wall of sound, creating an experience for fans where new details emerge from the apparent chaos with every listen.
Ultimately, Gorillaz succeeds in presenting a collection of innovative choices and collaborations that align with previous fan-favorite motifs without feeling derivative. As the band enters a new era in their lore-building quest, “Cracker Island” is sure to be a fan-favorite pit-stop on the esoteric journey.

“Hi, it’s Chappell, I know you just landed / And I know you’re probably busy but / I would love to see you so / Call me when you can,” rang out a voicemail message moments before the eagerly awaited arrival of Chappell Roan on the stage of the Sinclair on March 1.
The 25-year-old singer-songwriter from Willard, Missouri opened for both Olivia Rodrigo’s “Sour Tour” and Fletcher’s “Girl of My Dreams Tour” in 2022 before setting off on the “Naked In North America Tour” in 2023, this time as the headliner.
Roan is known for designing her costumes and makeup looks herself, frequently sharing the process on her TikTok account. An ardent lover of dressing up for her shows, Roan invited her fans to dress up with her, designating a theme for each of her tour stops and posting outfit inspiration and makeup tutorials on her social media accounts. Clad in pink cowboy hats, denim, and glitter, Cambridge’s crowd brought the pink pony club to life — a theme inspired by Roan’s single of the same name.
Opening the show with the voicemail intro of her hit song “Naked in Manhattan,” the danceable pop ballad about budding romance set the tone for the night’s performance. The song’s lyrics depict the rush of pursuing a romantic relationship: “I’d love if you knew you were on my mind / Constant like cicadas in the summertime.” Roan’s bouncy choreography conveyed that excitement effortlessly. Referencing “Mulholland Drive” and “slumber party kissing,” the song’s emphasis on embracing love, queer culture, and chasing your dreams is a trio of themes that Roan returned to throughout the night.
Her 2022 hit “Femininomenon” examines the idea of chasing the love you deserve from the perspective of an unfulfilling relationship. “You pretend to love his mother / Lying to your friends about how he’s such a damn good lover,” Roan belted as the audience sang along. Turning to her band, composed of Aubrey Harris on bass, Eliza Petrosyan on guitar, and Brittany Bowman on drums, Roan told them to “play a song with a f-cking beat” before resuming her dance across the stage, illuminated by green, pink, and white lights. A conduit for letting out the frustrations of unsatisfying love, “Femininomenon” encourages listeners to pursue substantial relationships, embrace their sexuality, and not settle for “crying at the nail salon.”
Roan shared some unreleased music as well, playing “Coffee,” “After Midnight,” and “Bitter.” The slow, melodic nature of “Coffee” captures the pain and nostalgia of getting coffee with a former romantic partner. What begins as an innocent encounter quickly devolves into one full of temptation and illusions. “After Midnight” serves as Roan’s retort to her parents who said “nothing good happens after midnight” and her dreamy celebration of the spontaneity that motivates late night adventures. Continuing this trend of memorializing her past self, “Bitter” honors the “sad angsty kid” that Roan was in high school.
“It’s a very different version of yourself when you’re in high school. I look back and I was so sad and it was so dark. Hopefully we are moving out of that space of depression and hatred for ourselves,” Roan said when introducing “Bitter.”
Her soulful vocals and just a simple acoustic guitar backing on the track create a country blues soundscape that illustrates not only the aforementioned sadness but the emotional reflection she’s done since.
“Hot To Go” is another way for Roan to accept her past selves — this time the part of herself that wanted to be a cheerleader. Leading the crowd through the cheer “H-O-T-T-O-G-O / You can take me hot to go,” Roan embodied the confidence that she gained over time, allowing herself to chase her dreams.
Inviting the audience to let out their animosity and resentment, Roan went on to perform “My Kink Is Karma.” An exploration of how good it feels to see a former partner doing terribly, Roan’s haunting vocals and the eerie red on-stage lighting provided a brief moment for listeners to embrace their not-so-healthy desire to see people get what they deserve.
Closing out the set with an encore performance of “Pink Pony Club,” Roan left fans dancing in their pink cowboy hats and belting “God, what have you done / you’re a pink pony girl.”
Roan delivered a crowd-pleasing performance full of heart and energy. Her stage presence and connection with the audience left fans eager for Roan’s return to Cambridge.

Soleil E. Golden ’24 has at least one thing in common with the average Harvard student — her room is her sanctuary. Covered in posters of Studio Ghibli films, Lana Del Rey, and Phoebe Bridgers, it functions as Golden’s place to grind out problem sets and care for her guinea pigs Esmée, Aspen, and Charlotte. But, unlike most Harvard students, the neuroscience concentrator’s room also serves as a set for her social media page.
Golden, alongside her research at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, is an influencer with over 520 thousand followers on TikTok (@toxicthotsyndrome) and 68 thousand followers on Instagram (@goldensoleil). In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, the Pforzheimer House resident shared more about her experience at Harvard and beyond.
In the spring of 2019, before her Tik Tok fame, Golden’s high school newspaper wrote a profile on her, focusing on how she never brought her phone to school.
“I have never really been concerned with other people’s lives through social media… I care about what’s going on in the world and Harry Styles, but other than that, I don’t spend much time looking to my phone to check Snapchat,” she said.
Three years later, Golden says she “can’t believe [she] used to be like that.”
By the fall of that same year Golden had downloaded TikTok and became an active user during the global shutdown in spring of 2020. Her entrypoint to the online space was through her love of “Criminal Minds,” where she found a virtual community with nothing but free time.
Golden’s eccentric fashion, makeup and lifestyle helped her create a fan base of her own — a phenomenon that still feels hard for her to wrap her mind around.
“My phone is my lifeline in many ways, but it can be a source of a lot of stress and a source of a lot of anxiety,” Golden said.
“It’s nice to know that people, before they meet me… know I exist,” said Golden, explaining how TikTok has changed her relationship with social anxiety. “It does definitely make me more aware of what I choose to share,” she added. “I do want to be an authentic person online.”
And she does exactly that. While Golden’s posts center beauty and lifestyle content, she often talks about her mental health, shares her hobbies such as writing poetry, and provides an honest look into life at Harvard. Golden hopes to present a genuine persona online, but she remains concerned about how TikTok can push users to over-consume for the sake of imitation.
“Nowadays you can literally buy a person’s life,” she said in regard to the rise of Amazon storefronts and Linktrees, where many of today’s online stars commercialize every part of their look for their followers. “There’s no authenticity to that.”
Golden has not let the TikTok trend cycle police her style. Her personal style derives from fashion across the decades, adding late ’70s and early ’80s influences to her closet. During the interview, she flipped through “Girl Pictures,” a 2018 photography book by Justine Kurland and credited movies like “Empire Records,” “Almost Famous,” and “Meet Joe Black” as some of her favorite places to find new looks.
“The internet has created such a weird divot in that kind of plan,” Golden stated, referring to the process of finding oneself, “where it's no longer about building your life, but it's about building your life based off a template you see on the internet.”
In an attempt to break away from this pattern, Golden banned the words “where” and “from” in her Tik Tok comments to encourage followers to break out of the loop of seeing, liking, and immediately buying items promoted by influencers. Instead, Golden tries to engage with followers through her original jewelry line, Made by Soleil, supplied through deconstructed personal jewelry and vintage passed down from family members.
Given the challenges that come with having a platform, Golden credits a need for representation as one of the reasons she continues to post.
“We are more than deserving of a seat at the table… and it is not for lack of trying” she said, arguing that TikTok’s algorithms are complicit in the lack of visibility of Black women in beauty. “Why aren’t you showing me videos of people that look like me?” she asks — the you being her TikTok For You Page.
Furthermore, as a Black woman at Harvard, Golden faces more invasive comments online about college admissions, including ones questioning her admittance to the college in light of the unfolding SFFA case.
“It’s so hard to not let it get to you.” she said. “I’m not going to lie, some days it can be exhausting. The way I rationalize all of this in my head is: I don’t want to stop doing what I’m doing because I remember how badly I wanted to see a person like me when I was younger.”
Golden tries her best to respond to followers interested in learning about her college application experience and the rigor of S.T.E.M. classes at Ivy League colleges.
Golden sees her TikTok as a part of her post-Harvard plans alongside becoming a doctor. While she was once a girl disconnected from internet culture, Soleil E. Golden finds herself at the core of what it means to be a force online today.

Were you able to snatch a pair of the UGG Classic Ultra Mini Platforms in Chestnut? What about the Babaton Contour Squareneck Longsleeve Bodysuit from Aritzia? Or maybe the black Skims Soft Lounge Long Slip Dress? If you answered no, you are among thousands that were both “too late to the trend” and only moved to purchase these items after they were sold out by hundreds of thousands of influenced TikTok users.
TikTok boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were forced to quarantine. Naturally, they turned to their phones for entertainment, and with TikTok’s easily digestible ten-second videos, the app became a source of many viral fashion trends. Countless fashion and styling videos appear on the Explore Page, with creators building followings of millions as they propagate different aesthetics and microtrends.
TikTok fashion aesthetics vary widely and are often given artsy, abstract names that convey the style’s essence. In the past years, multiple aesthetics have emerged into the mainstream, such as the VSCO girl, Coastal Grandma, Y2K resurgence, Grunge, Twee, and Clean Girl. Many styles have been also dubbed as “cores,” such as Clown-core, Barbie-core, Fairy-core, or Abercrombie-core.
Many of these style aesthetics have arisen alongside microtrends. Microtrends are fashion fads that experience a surge in popularity before often falling off just as quickly. Their brief life cycle consists of an introduction to the fashion realm of TikTok from popular creators, a quick rise to popularity, acceptance from audiences through For You Page algorithms and comments, a following decline in popularity, and eventually a sad death when the microtrend inevitably goes out of style and is seen as so-last-week or “cheugy.”
Microtrends have only become prominent in the fashion industry with the rise of TikTok, as the algorithm allows millions of people to see the same video showing off a certain style, giving a platform to more trends that may be presented through #ootds, hauls, sponsored posts, or #grwms. When teenage and young adult TikTok viewers witness other people finding joy in how they are perceived through the clothes they wear, they feel the desire to acquire the item.
Furthermore, the inherently performative nature of microtrends raises the question of whether following these trends erases identity and self-expression or fuels it. The surge in popularity of microtrends leads to them becoming more easily accessible; many of these high schoolers will purchase from fast fashion websites at low costs like Shein and Cider, because why wouldn’t you buy fake pearls from SheIn to fit the Coquette/Lolita-core aesthetic?
Aesthetics allow people to express themselves through their clothes while also building a sense of community with others. The distinct cores and aesthetics differ in multiple ways; while some emphasize neutral tones, athleisure, and simple aesthetics, others like the Weird-Girl aesthetic focus more on putting together bright colors through color-blocking with abstract prints. In fact, the Weird Girl aesthetic has even been called anti-fashion because it just does not fit into a certain box but rather makes its own. Even by taking a closer look at the Weird Girl aesthetic, it is clear to see that it includes a medley of many clothing pieces ranging from colorful knee-high socks, micro mini skirts, and Y2K baby tees, to oversized bomber jackets.
While the abundance of TikTok style aesthetics have made self-expression much more fun and accessible to people all over the world, it is important to remember that microtrends do feed into fast fashion. The fleeting nature of aesthetics and microtrends on TikTok create issues of overconsumption in their promotion of fast fashion, since companies need to design and produce clothing in the span of a couple of weeks to keep up with trends. This raises the question of whether following microtrends is even ethical; buying from such companies means putting money into the pockets of an industry that turns a profit at the expense of others. The rise of microtrends reminds us that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism and fast fashion.
Curating wardrobes to one’s personal style has never been easier and less anxiety-inducing with the platform of TikTok providing a vast and evolving style guide. The process is quite simple. As a consumer, if you like something, you buy it. If you don’t like it, you don’t buy it. There is no longer the need for the awkward stages of knee-length dresses, leggings paired with tacky off-the-shoulder tops, or denim on denim. Picking and choosing one’s personal style to curate a wardrobe saves so much time and nerves that teenagers often spend thinking about what they should be wearing versus what they feel like wearing and truly expressing themselves — all thanks to microtrends and aesthetics.

A daring shift from an unexpectedly long sequence of bodily fluids to a third act of thought-provoking social commentary cemented my love for “Triangle of Sadness.”
Ruben Östlund’s film, while soaked in seemingly meaningless vomit, is refreshingly complex. It has all you could ever ask for in a three-act film: Engaging events and delightful dialogue that turned a fascination with humans and their various bodily substances into something truly special.
The film follows model-influencers Yaya (Charibi Dean Kriek) and Carl (Harris Dickinson) on a vacation aboard a luxury yacht. Although expecting relaxation, chaos soon ensues once a violent storm wreaks havoc on the bowels of the ship and its affluent patrons. When all hope seems lost for the passengers, their trip just gets worse: Pirates take over the ship, stranding a pack of survivors on a nearby island.
Zany humor transforms this film from a horrific array of events into dark comedy in its finest form. Having a diverse cast aids this effort; by having each character represent various quirks, the film avoids dullness. Instead, a blend of memorable one-liners and jokes that are littered throughout the movie significantly enriched the viewing experience.
If this movie could be solely captured by the stylings of one character, it would be that of Woody Harrelson’s Captain. His character interestingly bridges the gap between random occurrences and larger messaging, turning the yacht captain into a broader denouncement of the elite class. With this, the film’s commentary on class is familiar yet distinct. While building on depictions of destructive privilege such as in “The White Lotus” and “Old”’s disturbing lost-on-a-beach narrative, it paves its own distinctive path that is worthy of an Oscar victory.
Harrelson, beyond his character’s fascinating narrative function, excels in his delivery of comedic yet impactful lines — creating many formidably memorable moments in the film. In addition to Harrelston, Kriek and Dickinson serve as excellent additions in this bizarre plot by allowing for the exploration of the dynamics of a couple caught in the appearance-obsessed throes of the influencer industry. As a viewer, I felt myself tugged alongside the ups and downs of the couple’s emotional journey, riding along the waves of their confusion and misery.
The film’s cinematography should also not be overlooked. Featuring a mixture of alluringly creative shots of the ship’s demise and the defeating life on a desert island ensures that each scene of the film is enticing. The film’s excellent capturing of beautiful landscapes and opulent interiors in the midst of pure chaos is similarly impressive.
In an Oscars season with notably impressive contenders, this film stands apart. And, avowedly, I am a fan of films that deviate from the audience’s expectations. However, whether or not you like deviations from feature film norms, “Triangle of Sadness” has much to love for every type of viewer.
While I admittedly didn’t know what was happening when watching the film — and quite frankly, still don’t — I reveled in my confusion. The film uses its weird nature to propel its appeal, making it my top pick for Best Picture.

A complicated relationship between a man and his dead best friend’s son, a dangerous, nearly impossible mission with an impending deadline, and lives at stake — what more could you possibly ask for?
“Top Gun: Maverick,” the highly anticipated sequel to the ’80s blockbuster “Top Gun,” delivers all of this and more. Along with its engrossing and nuanced plot, the film also features stellar performances from an A-list cast and stunning shots, making it the perfect candidate to win this year’s Best Picture award.
The film’s greatest strength lies in the compelling plot. Centered around Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), who trains a team of navy pilots to dismantle an unsanctioned uranium plant, an assignment so perilous that many doubt if it is even possible, much less survivable. There’s an even greater sense of urgency as the mission must run by a certain date whether the team is ready or not, and Maverick’s position in the Navy is being called into question at every turn.
“Top Gun: Maverick” manages to masterfully weave all of these elements together and create constant waves of suspense that leaves viewers fully engrossed every second. Often, the movie seemingly resolves the building tension in a scene, causing the audience to lower their guard, only to strike back unexpectedly with a new suspenseful twist. It brings the experience of watching the flying scenes as close as possible to actually being in the plane.
While the story has all of the underpinnings to be another typical pro-military patriotic film, it manages to steer clear of this and achieve nuance by focusing on the complicated relationships between the characters; camaraderie, teamwork, and forgiveness are at the forefront of themes explored. Maverick has a tangled history with one of his trainees, Bradley "Rooster" Bradshaw (Miles Teller). The son of Maverick’s best friend and a man for whose death he feels responsible. Additionally, it is revealed that Maverick hindered Rooster’s naval pilot career, causing Rooster to harbor lots of resentment towards him. The film focuses on the relationship between the two men and how they each grapple with their feelings toward the other, culminating in an extremely satisfying resolution. Miles Teller and Tom Cruise play the struggle between the two characters brilliantly, giving one of the best portrayals of a not-quite-father-son duo. Perhaps the most satisfying scene in the film is when Rooster, in one of the most stressful moments of his life, with anguish all over his face whispers, “Talk to me dad,” with Maverick whispering back, “Come on kid, you can do it.”
Other relationships are also integral to the movie and to the team’s success, and they further boost the complexity and enjoyability of the film. The team’s camaraderie is emphasized well, with wonderful performances by Glen Powell and Monica Barbaro. Maverick’s relationship with his friend and former rival Admiral Tom "Iceman" Kazansky (Val Kilmer) and romantic interest Penelope "Penny" Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly) add further dimension to the story. The movie manages to juggle these subplots and relationships deftly so they do not feel unnecessary or boring; each is essential to the whole of the film. One underlying issue Maverick faces throughout the film is finding his place outside of the navy. Time that Maverick spends with Penny forces him to grapple with this precise issue, making their relationship more than a cheesy romance. Maverick is able to confide in Penny about his rift with Rooster and worries about the future of his career, showcasing a whole other side of Maverick beyond his skill in a plane.
Furthermore, the visual images in the movie are stunning. “Top Gun” makes extensive use of aerial shots to capture the high-speed plane action, resulting in breathtaking visuals. In addition, the film features cutting-edge visual effects which help create a sense of realism and immersion in the aerial sequences, making the audience feel as if they are in the cockpit with the characters. The editing is fast-paced and dynamic, with rapid cuts and quick camera movements that create a sense of excitement and urgency, and they also help illustrate the technical skill and precision required for aerial maneuvers. Close-up shots in the planes make up many scenes, showcasing minute facial expressions of characters and the talent of the actors. These all combine for a thrilling viewing experience.
“Top Gun: Maverick” manages to take something nostalgic and breathe new life into it to make for a compelling, entertaining story. It covers themes that are universal and uplifting, and allows viewers a brief escape from reality. Regardless of whether or not it wins Best Picture, “Top Gun: Maverick” is a movie to be celebrated.

Elvis, The King of Rock ‘n’ Roll, was the ultimate teenage heartthrob of the 1950s who now, — with his renowned provocative dancing, greased-back black hair, and mesmerizing voice — has been brought back to life by Austin Butler in Baz Luhrmann’s “Elvis.”
Audiences watched the life of Elvis Presley from the perspective of Colonel Tom Parker, played by Tom Hanks, who was Presley’s questionable manager. Parker wakes up alone in a hospital room in Las Vegas, with papers and newscasters labeling him as a crook, a manipulator, and a cheat who took advantage of the young talent. So the movie is Parker’s attempt at explaining himself and telling the story of Elvis’s rise to fame and eventual fall.
The movie brings together audiences of all ages; typical moviegoers, teenagers, and even those who were fans during Elvis’s prime. The audience will surely enjoy the extraordinary performance of Austin Butler, which captures the whole essence of Presley — from his sideburns to his gravel voice. Butler’s performance is transformative, as seen in a major sequence of Elvis’s performance. You can see Elvis transform from a nervous kid with trembling legs behind the stage to a performer whose strong voice travels into the hearts of girls in the audience — carried by charm, charisma, and raw emotion. Butler became Elvis. He captured both the vulnerability of Presley as he faces rejection, as well as the highs when Elvis eventually falls in love with his wife, Priscilla.
Although it is predominantly a musical drama, the movie does more than tell the story of Elvis: It tells the story of a changing America. Elvis had been raised in a predominantly Black neighborhood, growing up with soul music that was crucial to the formation of his own style. His style was not accepted by many at the time; yet, he continued to perform to make his family proud. A scene in the film shows the suggestive nature of Elvis’s dancing and sound, earning him the title of “A white boy with Black moves.” Elvis’s main musical inspirations came from his childhood from the sounds of famous Black artists. The film highlights the racial controversies that arose from Elvis’s music as they fit into a broader conversation of racial dynamics and fame during the 1950s. The movie does a spectacular job of pointing out the tense social atmosphere at the time with threats of Elvis’s arrest and the transformation of his image.
“Elvis” is an ever-changing film with eye-catching sets and a color palette indicative of a rich and bustling lifestyle of vibrant Las Vegas shows, gambling, and fame. Butler revived an icon of American culture through his electrifying performances and a spot-on accent. Although an American icon, “Elvis” maintains relatability among audiences with its themes of family and love, which makes it a standout in the Best Picture category.
“Elvis” is deserving of the Best Picture Award. It had everything, with fantastic production and costume design, flowing storyline, and dazzling performances that made me wish I was one of the girls losing my voice and hollering at Elvis Presley myself!

“Lincoln,” director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner’s 2012 drama about the passage of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution by the House of Representatives, is a good movie, but it’s a little hokey. The climactic scene wherein the House finally votes to approve the amendment is typical of the whole: As jubilation takes hold of the chamber, lofty wind instruments play generic Americana. The “History” side of me cheers on the fact that the story is being told for a wide audience — the “& Literature” side just wishes it weren’t done so sentimentally.
Such sentimentality is, perhaps, to be expected from the man who directed “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,” but it comes as a bit of a surprise from the man who wrote “Angels in America.” Not that sentimentality is always a fault — “E.T.” is a great film, and Spielberg is responsible for many of those — but there is some potential in the Spielberg-Kushner partnership that was not realized by “Lincoln,” nor by last year’s “West Side Story,” which went all-in on the Kushnerian critique but lost just a little of the Spielberg magic.
“The Fabelmans” regains that magic by being intensely a Steven Spielberg picture and, equally intensely, a Tony Kushner screenplay. It is a celebration of cinema and a celebration by Spielberg of the love he puts into his films — and not, contrary to some critics’ interpretations, of himself, which is why “The Fabelmans” is a joyous artifact rather than an obnoxious one. It brings Spielberg, and us, back to the setting of mid-to-late-century suburbia as imagined by the man himself, and when author-insert Sammy Fabelman and his sisters walk for the first time to their new high school, one feels a rush of excitement at the nostalgic familiarity of it all.
Yet “The Fabelmans” is also analytical, and critical, of the gaze that has permeated Spielberg’s work. Spielberg worked with Kushner extensively on the screenplay — must have done, because the movie excavates his parents’ marriage and its effect on his filmmaking. It psychoanalyzes Spielberg in an almost Freudian fashion. What’s more, “The Fabelmans” interestingly suggests that the rose-colored lens through which Spielberg has shot white, goyische, suburban America has been for Spielberg a means both to have some part of an ideal that, as a mildly nebbishy 5’8” Jew, he was never to achieve and to take revenge on the owners and inhabitants of that very ideal. And the film is able to execute this synthesis of analysis and entertainment so well not only because Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner are very good at their jobs but also because, when you’ve had the impact on cinema that Steven Spielberg has had, autobiography is film history, and film history autobiography. The analysis is a natural outgrowth of the material.
What I keep coming back to is how fast the movie goes by. It’s two and a half hours long, and I was startled when I looked at my watch for the first time during the movie and realized there was just a half-hour left. That’s because the movie feels like vintage Spielberg — only with a newfound maturity and critical remove from itself. Frederick Douglass once asserted that the “process by which man is able to invent his own subjective consciousness into the objective form, considered in all its range, is in truth the highest attribute of man’s nature.” In “The Fabelmans,” Speilberg achieves this — without, however, getting so far afield of subjectivity as to lose a touch that really can be best described in one word: “Spielbergian.”

This summer will have more than poolside popsicles and a reprieve from eternal midterm season to look forward to. On June 1, Ruth J. Simmons will officially join Harvard as senior adviser to the University president on engagement with historically Black colleges and universities.
Although it’s still too early to judge the impact of this appointment, we celebrate the administration for beginning to execute the third recommendation of the Legacy of Slavery report, which calls for the development of lasting relationships with HBCU partners.
We have previously wished for greater concrete action to complement the thorough theoretical grounding of the Legacy of Slavery report. Simmons’s appointment transforms a vacant gesture into concrete partnership — exactly the kind of act we want from Harvard’s reckoning with its legacy of slavery.
Simmons’s position may be nebulous, limited to a part-time, advisory role. But Simmons’s exemplary accomplishments are crystal-clear and groundbreaking. She has served as president of three distinguished and distinct academic institutions: Smith College, Brown University, and most recently, Prairie View A&M University. She was also the first Black president of an Ivy League. At Brown, she pioneered one of the first initiatives in higher education to publicly acknowledge and investigate institutions’ historical connections to slavery.
Driving valuable change is clearly a staple of Simmons’s prolific career. We hope Harvard will empower her to continue doing what she does best.
The work that Simmons will commence at Harvard gleams with opportunities to cultivate novel partnerships beyond the wrought iron gates of the Ivy League and the high-tech labs of MIT, advancing equity across higher education. A school like Harvard, with its small, disproportionately wealthy student body, is in the bottom bracket of American colleges when it comes to building social mobility. An extra dollar spent on Harvard is better spent flowing resources to HBCUs and community colleges that lack our dedicated base of moneyed donors.
To be clear, we should not view partnerships with HBCUs as mere tokens of charity tossed out from Harvard’s deep coffers. We at Harvard have much to gain in our relationship with HBCUs: from their leading scholarship in disciplines intersecting with racial equity to their service of Generational African American students.
Of course, the academic contributions of HBCUs are not reserved to race-related matters. We note these particular examples because they so starkly contrast Harvard’s repeated failures. From lackluster faculty diversity and faltering half-attempts to develop an ethnic studies curriculum, to pervasive feelings of disparity among Generational African American students, Harvard not only can, but must, learn from HBCUs.
When Simmons delivered our Commencement address in 2021, we wrote that Harvard “invites a brilliant, forward-thinking speaker, yet does not follow her example in its own backyard.” Now, Harvard has welcomed that same brilliant, forward-thinking speaker to its front door. We can’t wait to open the door and follow in her example.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing Day is a venerated tradition — and one that entails a really fun morning. That won’t be the case for two of us this year, as we’ll be in class, taking midterm exams at 10:30 a.m.
This isn’t the first time students’ academic commitments have prevented them from having fun. This type of conflict is sometimes unavoidable and, for the sake of our education, often a good thing.
But on Housing Day, such conflicts are decidedly avoidable — which day a midterm takes place is simply a matter of professor choice. Today, we urge our professors to think twice.
To be clear, we know that academics take priority over partying — our professors were likely thinking along those lines when they scheduled our tests. But at Harvard, with its near-constant slog, why must we sit for exams on one of the singularly most fun days of the year?
We don’t agree that any trade-off between academics and Housing Day must exist. Most classes meet twice a week for thirteen weeks. What in-class midterm couldn’t be moved to the class before, or the one before that, or even the Thursday after Spring Break? It’s hard to imagine how giving an exam on Tuesday and holding an ordinary lecture on Housing Day would seriously compromise the course’s academic continuity. And if tweaking the date of a midterm would amount to choosing fun over school, we’re hard-pressed to imagine how a professor could make any accommodations for their students without seemingly putting school second.
You may be wondering why we’re making such a stink out of an inconveniently scheduled test. “Stop whining!”
But that very attitude betrays a disconcerting willingness to allow treasured traditions to fall by the wayside in the name of academics. It brings us to the far deeper roots of our strong feelings against Housing Day midterms.
Fundamentally, Harvard’s students are fun, and its culture is not.
This isn’t a shocking revelation. It manifests itself nearly everywhere in student life — including at last fall’s Harvard-Yale Game, perhaps the only event to share Housing Day’s pomp, when the administration banned independent student tailgates under the guise of student safety, providing only a highly restrictive and, if we may say so, lame tailgating option. Various Houses also banned all dormitory parties for the duration of the weekend, making us wonder whether The Game was meant to be an intercollegiate book club.
Harvard students responded exactly how they should have: by gathering en masse for an unofficial tailgate, simultaneously highlighting the frivolousness of the administration’s safety rationale and our capacity to create fun.
We’ve framed this tailgate as a triumph of students over the administration, and it was. But we rarely see that side of Harvard — boisterous, spontaneous, joyful.
In many ways, Harvard-Yale was the exception that proves the rule. Much of the time, we students perpetuate Harvard’s culture of non-fun. We let it drape over us like an inescapable cloak and we accede to its norms as if we were powerless to create the culture we all want. The administration’s helicopter parenting and the inherited social ecosystem of Harvard mix with students' apathy to these circumstances to create a deadly cocktail.
We’ve heard alumni stories of past freshman pastimes, such as playing Donkey Kong by rolling empty kegs down the stairs of Weld Hall, that tell us there was a time before the culture of non-fun.
While it’s true that many of these traditions, likely including the above, have been lost due to legitimate safety concerns, we’re making a broader point. Who could imagine Harvard administrators allowing anything like that to happen today, or students even trying to engage in such spontaneous play? Since then, it seems like our imagination, our conception of fun, has narrowed. Our campus’ vitality has withered.
We’ve stopped seeing this kind of fun, the kind that doesn’t take place only on Friday and Saturday nights, as integral to the college experience. We’ve sacrificed the nonroutine, the momentary, the improvised types of fun, treating these experiences as an expendable part of our packed schedules. It feels like too much effort to go to the Beanpot championship game when you could be working on a problem set instead.
Professors didn’t create Harvard’s rigid culture, and they won’t save us from it by moving their midterms from Housing Day. But moving exams isn’t trivial; small acts are necessary to induce big changes. A similar effort is needed from all of us. We shouldn’t accept the Harvard that was handed down to us as if it were the way things have to be. We owe it to ourselves, and those who follow, to create the environment we want to live in — and finally destroy Harvard’s unfortunate culture of non-fun.

In the colorfully lit studio of Boston Pole Fitness, a young woman stands on her head. Her hands are clasped around a silver pole, and her legs are poised above her body, back arched, toes pointed.
This is a photo of Stacey D. Fabo ’25 that was posted to the Harvard Undergraduate Pole Dancing Club. Fabo, who had no prior experience with pole dancing, became interested in the club after she saw their profile on Instagram. “I was like, ‘Oh, that sounds really cool,’” she says.
The Harvard Undergraduate Pole Dancing Club, which was formed this spring, offers free pole dancing classes to curious students.
Heather H. Park ’25 is one of the co-founders of HUPDC. When Park and her peers first floated the idea of a pole dancing club to a Class of 2025 GroupMe as freshmen, other interested students quickly joined their team. This year, they finally turned that idea into a reality through funding from the Harvard Office for the Arts.
The organization seeks to “empower” its members, particularly people from “historically disempowered identities,” according to its mission statement. Although spaces are filled through a lottery process, the club has “a preference towards low income and BIPOC students.” HUPDC has been intentional in their efforts to account for the financial inaccessibility of pole dancing classes.
Park says the club has “a really diverse range of people” from different genders, sexualities, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Modern pole dancing likely evolved from the pole routines of Chinese circus acrobats and the Indian pole gymnastics of Mallakhamb — two traditionally male-dominated sports created around the 12th century.
Although its significance has grown beyond its origins in the athletic world, pole dancing remains physically strenuous. At HUPDC classes, members always begin with half an hour of stretching — a slow, mindful session meant to build strength over time. Then, they transition to the pole, repeating unfamiliar exercises until every muscle burns.
Beyond teaching members how to pole dance, the club also aims to focus on body positivity through fitness and owning one’s own sexuality.
Through her work with HUPDC, Park says that she has been able to appreciate her body and “love it a little bit more through each class.”
Fabo’s feelings echo those of Park. “I’m generally very apprehensive of things that require a lot of coordination with your body,” she says. “But being able to pick up what I picked up in those classes instilled more confidence in me.”
“I have felt so utterly in touch with my body and its movement,” Arianna C. Fowler ’25 adds. “You’'re just moving your body in a way that evokes such confidence and acuity that would not be typical of typical exercise.”
The modern Western conception of pole dancing comes from the influence of circus-based exotic dance and “hoochie coochie” dancers that traveled around the United States during the Great Depression.
In the 1950s, strip clubs started popping up, capturing the essence of this idea in a new space. Strippers incorporated floorwork and choreography into pole dancing, synthesizing the sensual and athletic strands of pole dancing’s history.
Now, pole dancing has entered the mainstream through fitness classes, reality TV features, and performances by celebrities like Lil Nas X and FKA Twigs. Although its newfound visibility has helped pole dancing shed some of its stigma, those who hold power in the industry are not the ones who popularized the movement.
Because of pole dancing’s connection to sex work, Fowler says, the physicality and sexuality of the practice are often intertwined. “I genuinely believe that pole dancing should not have a stigma because it is so much fun,” Fowler says. “Just because it's in clubs and stuff like that doesn't mean it can't be a great form of exercise, as well as confidence, expressing your sexuality, and exploring body movement.”
The dichotomy that Fowler alludes to — between pole dancing as exercise and pole dancing as sex work — reflects a broader sentiment toward pole dancing that emerged as the practice came into the mainstream. Park still encounters people who are hesitant to try pole dancing.
“We do recognize the possible stigma with pole dancing,” she says. “We just want to emphasize that this is of course just another form of dance. We don’t want to differentiate ourselves from other dance organizations on campus.”
Conscious of this bias, HUPDC instead chooses to celebrate the connection between pole dancing and sex work. In their mission statement, HUPDC says that they “hope to honor the marginalized sex workers and strippers who have and continue to leverage the art.”
Many of the HUPDC members that we spoke to noted that pole dancing gives them something that regular exercise cannot. Fowler attributes this to pole dancing’s eroticism, describing an energy that puts her in touch with her mind, her body, and her being.
“I’'ve recorded myself during the whole damn thing,” she says. “And I can see the beauty of my own sexuality, my own self.”

Tucked away in Schlesinger Library lies a stapled stack of printer paper printed in a simple serif font. Made in 2005, “Pfoho Cookbook” features dozens of creative 5-step recipes highlighting the best Pforzheimer House dhall creations.
The cookbook is the product of two Pforzheimer students, Lauren M. Wolchok ’07 and Maureen Baur ’07. The two authors are still friends today, laughing and reminiscing as they speak to me about their inspiration for the cookbook.
“There’s this one peanut butter ice cream topping that we really liked making and so we wanted to compile other dining hall recipes and make them available for people,” Baur says.
That original recipe can be found within the book: a Peanut Butter Topping for Ice Cream recipe, submitted by Caitlin S. Bergin ’06 and credited to Adam W. B. Roben ’06.
The dining halls in 2005 differ from what students find today. At the time, Pfoho students had access to grills where they could heat certain foods themselves, like onions and spinach. Still, Wolchok remembers the dining hall food to be a “little bit repetitive,” explaining that she and Baur wanted to introduce variety into the menu.
The co-authors sent out a call for recipes on the Pfoho House email list. After the call for recipes, Baur and Wolchok applied to and received funding from the Pfoho House Committee for printing and stapling copies of the cookbook.
“We left them in a little basket and people could just take them,” Wolchok says. It came as a surprise when, after graduation, the Schlesinger Library reached out to add the cookbook to their collection. “So now we are basically published authors, right?” she says with a laugh.
Recipes within the book range from highly detailed processes to simple recipes. All are designed to enhance the dining experience. Patrick F. Baur ’07 — now Baur’s husband — submitted a one-step zucchini recipe directing students to “get zucchini and add parmesan cheese on top.”
To the authors, the “Pfoho Cookbook” was an entertaining one-month project, since their other extracurricular activities did not involve their interest in cooking. “It was fun to be able to do different things in the dining hall,” Wolchock says.
Baur volunteered with the Harvard ExperiMentors teaching science in schools across Boston and was responsible for renting out videos through the Pfoho Video Closet. Wolchok performed with the Mainly Jazz Dance Company and was a First-Year Outdoor Program leader.
For Wolchok and Baur, writing the “Pfoho Cookbook” was a way to introduce creativity into the dining hall and bolster house spirit.
“We had a great house. And a very tight-knit community,” Wolchok says. “So we felt we were definitely a part of a community and that the little cookbook project was welcomed and appreciated by the community.”

Art comes to life in Jenna Sutela’s artwork “Gut Flora (Cerebrobacillus).” Made of clay mixed with mammalian feces and glazed with breast milk, the relief is intended to explore the human microbiome. It is displayed in a triptych, alongside “Gut Flora (Lactogalaxius)” and “Gut Flora (Glossococcus).” Sutela wonders whether the interactions between microbe-rich breast milk and inert, fired clay could reanimate the biotic legacy of the feces within the clay.
Sutela’s pieces were displayed in MIT List Visual Art Center’s “Symbionts: Contemporary Artists and the Biosphere” exhibition, which ran from Oct. 21, 2022 to Feb. 26, 2023 in Kendall Square.
“The basic polemic of the exhibition is to remind us that we cohabitate with a lot of other species,” exhibit curator Natalie A. Bell says. “We need to understand that symbiosis, or ‘with-living,’ on a lot of different levels in order to be better partners in caring for the planet.”
Bell says that, in developing the exhibit, she and her co-curators Caroline A. Jones ’77 and Selby P. Nimrod searched for artists who were, “approaching the biosphere with a little bit more humility, and a more passive approach of taking a step back and kind of letting the living things do their thing.”
Much of the exhibition’s vision involved decentering the anthropocene and emphasizing the stories of plants and other forms of non-human biological life. “We humans have really done a lot of damage to our planet by thinking in a very anthropocentric way, and putting ourselves above other species,” Bell says.
Candice Lin’s “Memory (Study #2),” another work in the exhibit, emphasizes the restorative and cyclical nature of lion’s mane mushrooms and their relationship with humans. A plastic bag holds the mushrooms, a shaggy ivory-white fungus. Vital in traditional Chinese medicine, the mushroom has been shown to reduce anxiety, and may help slow memory loss in people with Alzheimer’s disease.
Lin explores how fungi like lion’s mane, which get nutrients from decaying organisms, can be a force for healing and remembering. Surrounding the bag of lion’s mane is an amaranth red ceramic structure reminiscent of coral. Both the ceramic structure and the fungus appear as if they are growing on and around each other in symbiosis.
The mushroom, however, cannot survive off of the clay. They obtain nutrients from the urine of curators who exhibit the work, contained in a small spray bottle displayed next to the piece. As a result, “Memory (Study #2)” is a collaborative piece between the artist, the fungi, the ceramic, and the museum workers.
Lin’s work represents the cyclical nature of our world: human waste gives the lion’s mane nutrients, which can later return their energy to humans. The recycled nutrients also invoke the idea of a collective consciousness across organisms and time.
Both Sutela’s and Lin’s works are known as BioArt, an emerging field at the intersection of life science and creative expression. The pieces are often metaphors, using biological media to make a statement and redefine the boundaries of art. Much of the BioArt on display at MIT’s Symbionts exhibit criticizes the way humans interact with the natural world.
Other branches of the field instead try to find the art within biology.
According to Joe Davis, a research affiliate at MIT's Department of Biology and staff at the George Church Laboratory at Harvard Medical School, a methodology focused on political or emotional metaphor undermines the art within biology. He believes artists who make BioArt must have a deep understanding of the science and mechanisms behind their work. “You have to describe the whole world — the problem with that is you can’t describe something that you choose to remain clueless about,” Davis says.
On the other hand, Sheryl L. White, the Coordinator of Visual Engagement and Exhibitions at the Arnold Arboretum, notes the benefits of displaying BioArt without extensive scientific detail.
“You get 10 million facts thrown at you, and how do you wade through them? And what do you believe or what don't you believe? But there's this sort of lovely thing that happens when artists actually think about science and how they can connect to it,” she says. “It becomes this way of almost understanding through your eyes what people are trying to tell you through your ears.”
One piece that works in this way at the Symbionts exhibit is a silent video projected onto the wall of a dark room. In the looping 18-hour, 52-minute video, titled “Confronting Vegetal Otherness: Skotopoiesis,” artist Špela Petrič stands still over a bed of germinating cress, projecting the shade created by her body onto the growing greens. “Skotopoiesis” means “shaped by darkness,” and Petrič’s shadow prevents sprouts in the shade from photosynthesizing. These sprouts withered and yellowed, and the resulting video of the process showed how easy it is to break the barrier between the human and plant worlds.
Whether it is finding art in biology or using biology to create art, BioArt provides a contemporary avenue for exploring humans’ relationship with the natural world. BioArt highlights the beauty of biological dynamics that are often obscured in graphs and jargon. At Symbionts, artists leverage the appreciation of the natural world to sound a warning about how humans are harming it.

UPDATED: March 23, 2023 at 12:55 a.m.
A pair of pink suede rollerskates, a book on Zuñi Fetish Carvings, four silver cherub earrings, and five Dizzy Gillespie records. Visitors encountered these objects and more at the Brighton Bazaar’s “Retromania: A Retrospective Expo” held Feb. 18 and 19 at the newly opened Roadrunner music venue.
Brighton Bazaar normally only holds open markets at the Charles River Speedway and in the Brighton Elks Lodge, but this was the first year organizers Emily A. Robertson and Andrew J. Gifford decided to hold an additional market, off-cycle from their regular season, with a specific retrospective theme. With close to 4,000 tickets sold and 114 vendors, the expo surpassed their expectations.
The day of the expo, Gifford sports a practical zip-up hoodie ideal for the physical work of setting up the expo, while Robertson opts for a patterned button-down and pair of Mary Janes. Gifford and Robertson own two other businesses, a vintage shop called All the Rage and Robertson’s handmade jewelry line, Feral Fawn Art.
The two initially considered naming their third business “Boston Bazaar” instead of “Brighton Bazaar,” but as longtime Brighton residents, they wanted to draw attention to their “corner of the city that has been kind of ignored and overlooked,” Gifford says.
Retromania is “for vendors, by vendors,” Gifford says, catering uniquely to the needs of vintage sellers. Gifford and Robertson have drawn on their own experience as vendors in other markets to find “what people really want in an event.”
“We’re really interested in things from a historical perspective, like the history of fashion and history of design,” Gifford says. He makes clear that “it’s not as easy as it seems to sort through tons and tons of stuff to find all of the pieces that are actually truly old and have a story.” To him, vintage collecting is, at its core, an endeavor steeped in creativity and narrative.
While a student in art school, Robertson began frequenting secondhand shops for their “weird art supplies.” Her first purchase of clothing, she says, was a polyester shirt from a thrift store. This shirt led to a highly curated and personal collection of ’70s disco shirts that now make up the bulk of her wardrobe.
Most of Retromania’s vendors also purchase secondhand clothes themselves and actively seek out sustainable collections.
One of the vendors, artist Emma G. Peacock, needle-felts, transforming wool tufts into adorable felt animals. Peacock found the vintage community while studying photography and graphic design. Her mentor encouraged her to needle-felt on top of her photography, and Peacock found that needle-felting related closely to her previous work as an oil painter. Peacock’s work is informed heavily by vintage design; plush mushrooms envelop her booth, taking on the shapes and colors of the Sears 1970s Merry Mushroom Canisters collection.
Because the work of Peacock and other vendors is not exactly vintage, Gifford and Robertson intentionally avoided labeling the expo a vintage market. True vintage markets tend to only take items 20 years and older, putting up a barrier for contemporary creators. With a recurring concern for inclusivity in mind, the pair chose the name because the term “retro” encompasses a wider range of pieces.
Included in this broader definition is the work of Marianne Radnitzky, a local vintage-inspired printmaker. Her designs adorn the event’s posters and social media publicity. Drawing inspiration from the psychedelic work of Peter Max and graphic designers of the 1970s, Radnitzky blends color palettes of the 20th century with contemporary iconography.
Items at Retromania are engaged in a constant conversation with one another, and the line between creation and curation is often blurred. Multimedia artist Chris J. O’Donnell, owner of the store Scorpio Sun, makes vintage collages from mid-20th century magazines, displaying them alongside velvet gowns and colorful stones.
There still exists a space within the expo for more traditional vintage collecting, though. Vinyl collector Russell Livingston of Uncommon Find Collectibles brought an extensive collection of records, ranging from jazz to ’70s pop. The small business owner finds a great sense of camaraderie in the vinyl collectors of the Boston area and insists that there is nothing quite like “putting a record on and reading the liner notes.” Livingston also relishes the research required for collecting vintage items, a passion shared with other Retromania vendors.
Jewelry collector and vendor Caryn Abroms stresses the cultural history of her vast collection. Mid-century silver is her specialty, but she generally keeps an eye open for “things that are different.” For this former teacher, a collector’s job not only lies in finding unique and timeless pieces, but also in educating the next generation. Abroms views collecting as a continual “learning experience.”
“It’s just endless,” she says.
For vendors and visitors alike, there is something gratifying and intellectually stimulating in combing flea markets and thrift shops for the perfect find. Based on the success they’ve seen from this year’s Retromania, organizers Gifford and Robertson are confident that this will become an annual event, something to “turn February from a kind of boring month into something exciting.”

Buried in the Harvard University Archives, there is a photograph of a ship gliding over water, its sails billowing in the wind, pointing to the unknown. It looks like a boat from the late 1400s, ready to cross the Atlantic and pillage the Americas. The sails of this ship bear not the crest of a kingdom, but the insignia of Harvard.
The ship was part of the 1939 Harvard Columbus Expedition, a five-month voyage across the Atlantic. On board were a hodgepodge of academics, sailors, Harvard affiliates, and their wives. Samuel Eliot Morison, Class of 1908 and a Harvard professor of American history, led the expedition. Through this journey, he sought to determine once and for all whether or not Columbus had sailed to the Americas based on his nautical talent, or if he ended up there by chance.
Four years later, Morison would win a Pulitzer Prize for his book, “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” a biography written using material from the Harvard Columbus Expedition. Despite his initial doubts, by the end of the journey, Morison concluded that Columbus was a “good dead-reckoning mariner.”
Morison’s own journey began long before he set sail on the Expedition. Morison first learned to sail as a teenager and enjoyed it. According to his obituary by Washington Star writer John McKelway, Morison “once told an interviewer that he would have preferred to have been an explorer. But he never had the time.”
Instead, he focused on his academic pursuits. Morison received his B.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard, then returned to Cambridge to continue his academic career after stints at Berkeley and Oxford. By 1939, Morison had already published over 20 books.
Even then, Columbus’s reputation was hotly contested. Some contemporaries saw the seaman as an “ignorant and lucky landlubber.” Across the pond, in 1939, the Oxford Debate Union resolved to “deplore the discovery of America” and that “the discovery of America was a greater misfortune than the fall of Rome.”
Decades earlier, Morison had already begun pondering Columbus’ legacy as an incapable navigator, though notably, not questioning his role in colonizing the Americas.
In the summer of 1915, Morison started drawing up his curriculum for an American colonial history class he would teach in the fall. He found that he had spent almost an entire month researching Columbus for the course, and there was still much left to uncover about the man.
Ultimately, Morison decided “the only way to solve the problem of this great navigator, really to ‘get at’ him, was to explore, under sail, the coasts and islands he discovered.”
Thus, the Harvard Columbus expedition was born.
The expedition was funded mainly by Harvard and partially by some members of the expedition. The cabin’s mantel in their ship, Capitana, displayed an image of the president of the United States with a note written atop: “For Sam Morison, Columbus Jr., from his friend, Franklin D. Roosevelt.’” So, on Aug. 28, 1939, a “mixture of amateurs and professionals” set off from a yacht club in New York. They planned to travel along the route of Columbus’s third and final voyage across the Atlantic.
Sailing amid the war, the group of academics masqueraded as adventurers, though they painted an American flag to the boat’s exterior just to be safe.
Morison was joined by Captain John W. Elroy, a surgeon, multiple seamen, and graduate students. His wife, Elizabeth S. Greene, and his daughter, Elizabeth G. Spingarn, also came along on the journey. Morison was said to have preferred bringing women on board because they “keep the morale on a higher level.” And with their presence, “there are fewer swear-words and better dressing, and everybody is generally tidier and more amiable.”
Using only Columbus’s firsthand accounts and records from the time period, they traveled from Portugal to Trinidad, making stops along the way in the Portuguese island of Madeira and the Canary Islands.
After going to Portugal, Morison and part of his crew switched to sailing on the Mary Otis, a smaller boat that was a reproduction of the Nina on Columbus’s voyage. Capitana would follow them with the rest of the crew. They spent the voyage meticulously following the notes of Columbus, and in some instances proved his narrative of the voyage to be more accurate than some scholars believed. For instance, Morison could see the three hills of Tobago as he left Trinidad, just as Columbus noted, something that historians and mathematicians alike claimed was impossible.
The trip was not without its fair share of catastrophes. At 3 a.m. on their tenth night, the rough seas caused “an uneasy rolling and pitching” that caused the Capitana’s lifeboats to fall out. A few days later, the mizzen gaff — one of the parts of the Capitana that held up the sail — snapped in the middle of a “violent squall.” The crew quickly repaired the mizzen gaff and escaped dire consequences.
They did, however, face further troubles. On the second night after switching from the Capitana to the Mary Otis, the steering gear stopped working. The crew found themselves at the mercy of the seas, eventually entering Casablanca, “unseen, unchallenged, and through an unswept channel.” Soon after, French customs officers cornered the ship, asking how they managed to enter the port without getting shot by patrol planes. They congratulated the crew on “safely crossing a minefield” during the war.
In February 1940, the voyagers of the expedition made it back to U.S. shores and Morison began answering the question he had pondered for a quarter of a century. After two years of writing, Morison published “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” which would end up being reviewed on the front page of the March 1, 1942, edition of The New York Times Book Review.
The reviewer, Philip A. Means, criticized the biography for not addressing the arguments of other historians. For instance, historian Vihjalmur Stefansson claimed that Columbus had previously visited Iceland in 1477, long before his famous expedition. Means claimed that instead of addressing this point, Morison disregarded those claims and continued in his analysis. However, Means also praised Morison’s beautiful pictures, which were “so vivid that we can almost smell the luscious exuberance of those tropical wilds.”
One member of the expedition, lawyer, and diplomat James MacGregor Byrne ’31, praised Morison in his chronicle of the journey, writing that despite the war, shipwrecks, and other tribulations along the journey, Morison “kept the Capitana on schedule.”
“Through his superb leadership the Harvard Columbus Expedition never wavered in its serious professional objectives and was brought to a successful and harmonious conclusion,” he added.
Morison’s academic adventures didn’t end with this voyage. Beyond “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” Morison wrote a biography of Columbus in 1954 titled “Christopher Columbus, Mariner.” In writing his book, he upheld Columbus as a sailor with skill and glossed over the horrors of colonialism. Genocide and enslavement are briefly mentioned in the book, but the focus remained on Columbus’s skill as a navigator, polishing his legacy as a seaman over his contributions to colonialism.
Morison would go on to win a second Pulitzer in 1960 for his biography of John Paul Jones, another sailor, and receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1964. He continued to teach at Harvard until 1955.
The Harvard Columbus Expedition is the stuff of legends — a legend that Morison created himself, mythologizing the voyage he took to relive the life of a man he glorified.

When you walk up to 2 Divinity Ave. in the northern part of Harvard’s campus, the first thing you’re likely to notice are the stone lions that flank the main entrance. Donated in 1962, these statues — which are originally from Beijing and are also featured on the East Asian Studies Department’s logo — are one of the few outside indications that the Department is housed inside.
A closer look, however, will reveal another carved ornament: a map of the world etched in stone, sitting above the door and standing out from the warm red brick. The map is centered on the Americas, and Asia is cut out almost entirely — curious for a building that houses East Asian Studies. Truthfully, it hints at the building’s complicated past.
For the past 65 years, the building at 2 Divinity Ave. has been the nexus of three of Harvard’s major East Asian Studies organizations: Harvard-Yenching Institute, Harvard-Yenching Library, and the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations. But this was not always the case. It was originally constructed to house the Institute of Geographical Exploration, a short-lived department organized and funded by Alexander Hamilton Rice, Class of 1898.
The history of the Institute of Geographical Exploration begins with a donation from Eleanor Elkins Widener, who also funded the construction of Widener Library as a memorial to her son who drowned with the Titanic. She also lost her husband in the disaster, and afterwards remarried to Rice.
Educated as a surgeon, Rice developed an interest in geography after leading several trips to South America to create maps of the Amazon River basin. These trips resulted in racist and extractive encounters with — and in at least one case, the murder of — Indigenous peoples of the region.
After returning, Rice searched for an executive role to make his interest official. He first donated money to the American Geographical Society, in hopes of obtaining the position of director, but failed. Then he turned to Harvard.
Widener and Rice approached former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, with a deal: They would use the Widener fortune to fund the construction and maintenance of the Institute of Geographical Exploration, as long as Harvard appointed Rice as institute director and a professor.
“It’'s kind of a vanity project for him,” EALC department head David L. Howell says.
Lowell ultimately accepted their donation and terms, and they hired Horace Trumbauer, the same architecture company that built Widener Library, to build the institute in 1930. The architect behind the build was Julian Francis Abele, who also designed Widener and was the first Black graduate from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Fine Arts.
Though Rice by then had the title Director of the Institute of Geographical Exploration, problems surrounding his reputation arose. The geography and geology departments disdained him, referring to him as a “scoundrel” and “nuisance” for the fact that he essentially purchased his University position.
After Harvard discontinued its geography department in 1948, there was no impetus to keep the institute alive. Rice left Harvard in 1951 to return to Widener’s 65-room Newport cottage.
As the Institute of Geographical Exploration declined, East Asian Studies was coming into its stride. In 1958, six years after Rice left, the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Harvard-Yenching Library, and EALC moved to 2 Divinity Ave.
Yet the story of East Asian Studies at Harvard begins long before the move to its long-term home on campus. Its history starts in 1879, when Harvard’s first teacher of Chinese, Ge Kunhua, arrived from Ningbo, China. He only taught for three years, but his posting spurred Harvard to start a Chinese and Japanese book collection. It wasn’t until around 40 years later that a more permanent East Asia program was established.
“There was nothing much until the early 20th century,” Howell says. “The key thing was that in 1928, the Harvard Yenching Institute was founded with a gift from Charles Hall.”
Hall made his wealth from the aluminum business, and around 1925 the trustees of his estate began working with Harvard and Yenching University in Beijing to coordinate the expansion of Harvard’s book collection and help promote higher education in East Asia.
As the institute was getting off the ground, Harvard began offering its first course in the East Asian Studies discipline. Its instructor hired a doctoral student, Alfred Kaiming Chiu, to catalog the collection that would become Yenching Library. In 1929, the library and Harvard-Yenching Institute moved into Boylston Hall.
Just one year later, the library was officially named the “Chinese-Japanese Library of the Harvard-Yenching Institute.” It quickly became “the home for Chinese students and scholars of East Asian studies,” writes Harvard-Yenching Associate Director Ruohong Li in a 2021 paper.
Between the years of 1928 and 1958, all three of these organizations grew increasingly robust. A turning point occurred in the “post-WWII years,” when there was “an increasing demand not only for significant expansion of courses in East Asian Studies, but also for library collections in East Asian languages on traditional subjects as well as contemporary East Asian issues and problems,” Li wrote.
The growth was “in part supported by the U.S. government and big foundations, like the Ford Foundation, and others, partly as a Cold War thing,” says Howell. “Lots of people were directed — by people I mean male university students, but also veterans coming back from the war — were directed into the study of Japanese and Chinese, and to some extent, Korean language, because of the war.”
Around that point, it became clear that Boylston simply wasn’t big enough — nor fit to protect the growing number of rare texts housed there. After a brief renovation, the Harvard-Yenching Institute, Harvard-Yenching Library, and EALC all moved into 2 Divinity Ave.
East Asian Studies at Harvard has continued to grow since the 1950s. The library has 1.4 million holdings as of 2018. Yenching Institute, though no longer affiliated with the now- defunct Yenching University, continues a robust program of exchange of scholars and scholarship between East Asia and Harvard, and the EALC department has a wide variety of yearly course offerings as well as a renowned language study program. Rather like Boylston before it, 2 Divinity Ave. — replete with its nested history of area-based study at Harvard — has become too small to contain the entirety of the East Asian Studies Department. Many of its offices and classrooms occupy satellite spaces.
When you pass the lions and enter the foyer of 2 Divinity Ave., you’ll see a plaque with Rice’s name mounted to the right of the entrance. As the East Asian Languages and Civilizations Department looks to the future, some have begun to notice the disconnect between Rice’s role and views and what the building stands for now. The department has been debating potentially replacing the plaque with one that honors the building’s architect, Abele, instead.
“He seems like somebody who would be more interesting and more worthwhile to celebrate than a vestige from the past,” Howell says.

I’ve never actually seen a physical jukebox before. Tucked away in a corner of Cambridge’s Foundry, a creative space in Kendall Square, the machine in front of me prompts me to make a selection from its arrangement of letters and numbers.
I press B7 and take a seat on the purple and off-white checkered bench that lines the wall. But it’s not a song that starts playing. It’s the voice of Leon E. Wilson Jr., the president and CEO of the African American History Museum of Boston and Nantucket, sharing the story of how one of his old teachers, Ms. Key, inspired his future academic pursuits.
Next, I click C3. Cambridge attorney Wesley Taylor’s voice fills the room, speaking about his experiences leaving Cambridge — the city his family had lived in for decades — and his decision to eventually return to the place he calls home.
“Cambridge may not be perfect. But I can’t think of any other place that I’d rather live,” Taylor says.
These stories are part of Jukebox, a participatory art project created by Elisa H. Hamilton, who describes herself as a “socially engaged multimedia artist.” Hamilton intends for the project to create a hub for sharing and saving Cambridge residents’ stories, especially those of the city’s residents of color.
She recorded the stories in collaboration with digital storytelling nonprofit The Loop Lab, the Cambridge Public Library, and the Cambridge Black History Project — an organization that studies and spreads awareness about the lives of Black Cambridge residents. The project, which took four years to develop, is funded through Cambridge’s Percent-for-Art Program, which stipulates that 1 percent of the city’s construction costs are used for artwork.
Hamilton’s first step in turning this idea into a reality was acquiring a physical jukebox. After much searching, Hamilton decided to buy a vintage jukebox cabinet — a jukebox without records in it.
“This is a project that is going to exist in public space, potentially forever, we hope, and so, as much as I love records, I really wanted this jukebox to be something that folks could in the future record new stories for and easily swap out the stories without financial barriers,” she says.
To computerize the device, Hamilton worked with an engineer who replaced the jukebox’s internals with a digital system that is easy to use and update — all of the stories are simply stored on a thumb drive.
Once the structure was in place, Hamilton began working on the jukebox’s aesthetics. To preserve the aesthetic of a jukebox, she created sculptures — now seen through its glass screen — that spin when stories are playing. She also hired someone to clean up the body of the machine and made an “album cover” for each story to celebrate the individual who shared it, some of which are framed around the room.
“If you look at the website, if you listen to any of the stories, if you visit the Jukebox nook at The Foundry, you’ll notice that there’s a memorable visual identity, and I worked with a graphic designer to realize that identity,” Hamilton says.
She credits her collaborators for the project’s success, saying that while she was “the driver of this project,” she had an “extraordinary” team whom she could not have given life to the project without.
So far, Jukebox has shared 25 stories. Hamilton says she has already recorded 25 more and that her goal is to reach 100. Even after she reaches her goal, though, she hopes that people will continue to share their ideas with each other.
“I really do believe that by sharing stories with each other, we grow to understand ourselves better and we grow to understand the people around us better,” she says.
Jukebox also contains a tale of her own, the first story — A1. Hamilton’s voice echoes through The Foundry with her retelling of why she created Jukebox.
“Jukebox is a story sharing project, not a storytelling project,” she says. “Telling is one-sided, but sharing is something that we can all do together.”

I have this thing against buying new socks. I’ll wear them until my toes point out or my heel rubs against the sole of my shoe. I just can’t seem to justify buying a new pair.
“Do you really like those?” my great-grandmother asked me last December at my family’s Hanukkah celebration, placing on the table a batch of freshly fried latkes — the same recipe I have had on this holiday for the last 19 years. She was pointing at my sock, or more specifically, my fully-exposed big toe.
“If you want to keep them that badly, I’ll patch the hole for you.”
My Grandma Ruth, who turned 99 last summer, is somewhat of a local celebrity. She worked as a sewing instructor at the Henry Street Settlement — a social service organization in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, where she has lived since 1923 — for over 50 years. She was New Yorker of the Week in 2015 and was featured on an episode on the Cooking Channel’s “My Grandmother’s Ravioli” (on which I made my first and only television appearance).
Only at the age of 97 did she decide it was a reasonable time to retire, but she still helps out my grandmother, her daughter, with her tag sale business, manning rooms of forsaken jewelry and clothing, bartering with the locals who’ve come to snag a deal.
She has lived in the same neighborhood her whole life. She once inhabited a crowded and grimy tenement of Eastern European Jewish immigrants.
Now, she watches hipster millennial types line up outside the bars and coffee shops that have multiplied throughout the streets surrounding her apartment. That neighborhood was the subject of my AP U.S. History final research paper, and Grandma Ruth served as my main source, colorfully narrating the evolution of her city streets, which have changed drastically during the 99 years that she has lived there.
I often marvel at how it must feel to move throughout the world with such lived experience — how a person can bear witness to so much history and still take to the streets every day in a plush faux-mink coat with the fervent zeal of a person eager to inhale the equally familiar and foreign sights, smells, and sounds of New York City. As I walk to Trader Joe’s for my weekly grocery run, I can only hope to embody her and borrow from her celebrity attitude, the result of occasionally being recognized for her various media appearances and awards.
Growing up in the Lower East Side with Yiddish as her only language, Grandma Ruth’s employment prospects were limited. She took up sewing with masterful ease; she replicated an exact model (truthfully, a better one) of the wedding dress she saw in the window of Bergdorf Goodman which was worth more than her apartment.
As the matriarch of my family, we have always relied on her not only for our garment-based needs, but also her unwavering leadership as the quintessential Jewish grandmother. My entire conception of my religion is based on the values of hard work, kindness, and individuality that she has maintained throughout the last century along with her steadfast devotion to our family. Every holiday or birthday dinner, all she wishes is to be well until the next occasion that we’re together and for her never to be a burden for the family (as if we would ever consider her one).
It sounds strange to say that I look up to someone who’s a foot and a half shorter than me, but Grandma Ruth has always been my muse: I can only hope to be able to live like her in my 90s. She takes the subway from the Lower East Side to Grand Central, and then takes the train to the suburbs, all while hauling a host of hemmed and tailored garments and a jar of matzo ball soup to seven great-grandchildren.
On one of those visits, I asked her to teach me her signature recipe. Over time, Grandma Ruth has mastered the art, reliably producing the 30 matzo balls to be scarfed down by my extended family at each holiday. This was the signature dish that, along with her killer backstory and my Grandma Hesta’s brisket, earned her a spot on the Cooking Channel.
The first time Grandma Ruth taught me to make matzo balls I was 12. The process was snappy and graceful — no recipe required. She grabbed a bowl, added water from the faucet, dropped in some eggs, poured some oil, then mixed in about a box matzo meal. No measurements needed. She added more of one ingredient or another until the soggy mixture coalesced under her fingertips. The matzo balls came out perfectly: chewy but light, perfectly salty, packed with flavor.
When I tried to eyeball them myself a week later, the matzo balls fell apart and crumbled before I could take them out of the boiling water. I haven’t tried to make them since. I’d rather just wait until Rosh Hashanah.
As she enters her 100th year and I enter my 20th, I have been reflecting more on the time we’ve spent together. It has shaped my whole life and a fifth of hers. I can measure my time in memories of Grandma Ruth: the endless hours of Go Fish we played when she babysat for my parents, the coffee cakes she brought with her, the pounds of matzo balls I’ve eaten at every family holiday (now shipped to me in college), the suits I’ve worn that have been relentlessly hemmed to keep up with my adolescent growth spurts, her Lower East Side apartment which has not been updated since its purchase in 1960, the used tea bags saved at the side of the sink that elicit raised eyebrows from visitors, the kenahorah-poo-poo-poos uttered to keep the evil eye away. Sewn together, these memories create the patchwork of my life that has always relied on the presence of my great-grandmother.
I’ll never go to a tailor. Bringing Grandma Ruth my ripped, stained, and ill-fitting clothing is its own ritual — even for a pair of socks that could be replaced with much less hassle.
I can’t make my own matzo balls to save my life, let alone grasp what it was like for her to raise a daughter after her husband came home from World War II decimated by post-traumatic stress disorder and passed away a few years later.
Grandma Ruth, however, spares no pity for herself. During her guest appearance on “My Grandmother’s Ravioli,” Grandma Ruth tells the show’s host about her neighbor who told her she was sorry that she had to live alone without a husband.
“Feel sorry for me?” she retorts. “You should rejoice for me!”
Grandma Ruth relishes her apartment life, the self-sustained wardrobe she has tailored to her exact preference, and the bragging rights that come with maintaining her independence at 99. With her at the forefront of my family, I have never feared the prospect of aging either.
I’m not immune to aging, but I will strive to emulate Grandma Ruth’s mentality of proud independence for the rest of my life. Or at least, as I enter my 20s.

Dayna P. Altman glazes on positivity with a heavy hand. With distinctively large black glasses and a smile just as big, she floats around the room. To each table of competitors, she doles out cans of frosting and Ziploc bags of food coloring, fondant, marshmallows, and candy. It’s the Sunday afternoon of Feb. 26 in the Green Room, an intimate event space in Somerville, and the air is thick with anticipation for the culinary catastrophes to come.
Altman is the founder of Bake it Till You Make it LLC, a “community based organization dedicated to destigmatizing mental illness, normalizing mental health conversation and promoting authentic healing and recovery” that seeks to connect people through food, according to its website.
“So much of this organization was built because I felt so lonely,” Altman says. “I wanted to create a community where you could be open.”
This desire spurred her to begin hosting events like this one, called “Nailed It!” — now in its third year. It’s a cupcake-decorating competition based on the Netflix show of the same name where amateur bakers are tasked with recreating complex culinary creations (mishaps abound).
Unlike competitors on the show, the 13 attendees, who are divided into seven teams, are never charged with touching a hand mixer, much less an oven; they instead receive pre-made cupcakes to decorate. And rather than vying for new kitchen appliances or cash prizes, this assortment of people from all different avenues of Altman’s life — friends, family, followers, and a documentary film crew — are united by her mission of starting conversations about mental health through baking.
The Bake it Till You Make it project, which takes its name from a different amateur baking show on Food Network, grew out of a cookbook of the same title which Altman released in 2019. The book contains a mixture of stories and recipes contributed by 43 people who have struggled with mental illness.
Following the publication of this cookbook, “I started doing these events where I would tell my own mental health story using the ingredients as metaphors,” Altman says. “So for example, if I’m cracking an egg, I’m talking about a time that was really difficult for me.” In her advocacy, Altman aims to be open about her obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and recovery from an eating disorder and sexual assault. Since publishing Bake it Till You Make it, she has released three more books — an additional collaborative storytelling cookbook, a collection of bread recipes and poems, and an account of her own story told as a cake pop recipe.
Back in the Green Room, the competitors of BITYMI move through three progressively difficult rounds. Armed only with the ingredients at their tables, creativity, and perseverance, they attempt to fashion snowmen, cacti, and unicorns out of the blank canvases of Funfetti cupcakes. They strategize how best to transform a marshmallow into modeling clay and prevent their saccharine structures from collapsing onto the paper plates beneath them.
“I’m operating on a vibe economy right now,” says Julia Guilardi, a long-time friend of Altman, when asked how she and her team partner, Nicole Yang, are going to win.
Part of the inspiration behind BITYMI comes from a difficult summer for Altman in 2017. “I was in grad school, I was living with my parents. I didn’t have a car, and all I had was baking. All I had was the kitchen,” she recounts. Trying recipes with friends allowed her to open up and have conversations that may not have otherwise come about.
Cooking gave solace to many from the social disconnection of quarantine at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic; recipes for whipped coffee went viral, and posts of homemade bread were inescapable. Altman believes this trend illustrates the therapeutic aspect of cooking and baking.
“It’s amazing to have control over something in such an uncontrollable world, like being able to try new recipes and see the manifestation of your hard work,” she says.
In May 2022, Altman spoke at the White House as a part of a Mental Health Awareness Month event. At the event, Altman met Theadora R. Touchton and Alvaro S. Gonzalez from Sueñito Media, an independent production company focused on increasing Latinx and LGBTQ+ representation in film.
The two parties have partnered to create a documentary — part of which was filmed at this year’s BITYMI. Altman hopes that this documentary will show people that they “don’t have to be a celebrity to start something big.”
“I just feel like vulnerability is contagious in a lot of ways,” Altman says. “So many people have come to share their stories with me, because I’ve shared my stories with them.”

Content warning: Descriptions of depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses and psychiatric conditions; descriptions of drug use.
As we sat in Harvard’s Currier House dining hall for a fifth consecutive hour — the frenzy of lunchtime falling into a midafternoon lull and the days we had planned unraveling, classes and meetings missed — our conversation about our experiences with psychiatric drugs engulfed us. Questions long festering in our minds entered and thickened the air between us, and our search for clarity yielded only more confusion.
How can we — how should we — make sense of the psychiatric medications in our bodies and the experiences, feelings, and thoughts they engender? The practice of fine-tuning our minds to best fit the shape of our lives... is it a good one? Does it obscure our “real” selves?
We joked about eventually writing this piece, and about how we were part of some secret magic pill club. We discerned that every day, between the two of us, we take up to 448 milligrams of medication: antidepressants, anxiolytics, stimulants, and relaxants. But the jokes felt less like jokes as time went on. We hadn’t anticipated just how difficult these questions would be to ignore, or how much we’d been craving the community we found in our conversation.
Psychiatric medication warps our experiences and those of many of our classmates, and in recent years, the use of these drugs has risen. Between 2007 and 2019, the proportion of American university students taking the most commonly prescribed antidepressants has nearly doubled, from 8 percent to 15.3 percent. Rates of depression in college students have similarly surged, from 17.4 percent in 2013 to 40.8 percent in 2021, and rates of anxiety have doubled.
Yet there is no Magic Pill Club, and the phenomenon of using psychiatric drugs remains largely unscrutinized, piercing the social fabric only through isolated conversations and errant private social media posts.
So we set out to document and better understand this aspect of living with mental illness, seeking answers to the questions brought to life in Currier’s dining hall. We conducted a dozen interviews with students taking psychiatric medications and experts across various disciplines. The process was turbulent, dragging us through sometimes painful memories and realizations. It challenged our conception of ourselves and our medications, in turn surprising us, enlightening us, and leaving us in tears.
We found no definite answers.
Researchers have established that psychiatric medications alter levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain. They’ve also shown the medications can relieve mental and emotional distress for some patients. But the link between how these drugs work and why they can be effective eludes modern psychiatry, as does a complete understanding of what causes mental illness. Some patients aren’t helped by psychiatric drugs, and many are left struggling.
Interviews with students about their experiences with medication did not cohere into a real answer either. One described their medication as stripping away their basic humanity, another as restoring them back to themselves, and yet another as providing nothing more than a gentle boost.
Still, we did discover something, laying the conversation we began months ago to rest. It didn’t answer our questions, but it quieted the anxieties behind them, providing new ways to understand our experiences.
The perseverance of students and spirit of psychiatrists — often forced to confront the blank face of uncertainty — wove together into a tapestry of resilience, one at once tattered and perfect, inspiring and incomplete.
The Crimson offered anonymity to all of the students mentioned in this piece due to the sensitive nature of their psychiatric and medical experiences. All names in this piece, unless accompanied by a surname, are pseudonyms for Harvard College undergraduates. This choice was made to aid readability and to humanize the subjects of this story.
KSG & GRW: Hannah began taking Zoloft — a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI — during the summer after her senior year of high school.
Her decision followed protracted struggles with mental health. She developed anxious and obsessive thoughts sophomore year of high school, and depression years later. Throughout, she was hesitant to consider her mental state abnormal and grappled with questions about whether her suffering was an inevitable part of her life.
The pandemic saw Hannah’s struggles increase exponentially, especially by her senior year. “During the pandemic, honestly, I would say I cried every single night, for hours,” she says. “And that’s just not a normal thing.”
At the time, “I didn’t really realize how wild that was or how not okay that was until after,” she says.
Hannah says her psychiatrist “isn’t someone who’s very drug-heavy.” And Hannah’s mother had always been hesitant about medication. But it was actually her mother, seeing how persistently miserable her daughter was, who recommended that Hannah consider psychiatric medication. Hannah says that starting Zoloft “wasn't really that hard of a decision.”
“I was kind of feeling awful and wanting to not feel awful,” she says.
It wasn’t as though she started feeling better right away, she says, but she noticed little things that built up: She cried significantly less, she felt more confident, her obsessive thoughts weren’t all-consuming, and she talked to new people without paralyzing anxiety.
But Hannah still grappled with the implications of these improvements. This past summer, while reading “Brave New World” — a novel in which characters take a drug called soma that makes them happier and distracts them from issues plaguing their dystopian world — Hannah thought to herself: “Am I doing that? Am I ignoring things?”
Hannah used to dream of being a writer. She thinks part of why she wanted the career is because she felt her emotions so intensely. She remembers thinking: “Life sucks. What am I going to do with this if I’m not writing about it?”
Before she began taking Zoloft, she asked her therapist if it would make her a different person. Her therapist said no — the medication would just make things less extreme, like a cushion. That rings true to Hannah’s experience: Zoloft isn’t soma, she says. She doesn’t think she’s lost the thoughtful or emotional aspects of herself — the intensity with which she experiences the world has just lessened.
Hannah believes the question of whether medication obscures the “real” self underneath isn’t the most relevant: “Does it matter if you’re yourself if you’re miserable?”
KSG: I am a crier — I’ll admit it. I teared up when Hannah asked if it matters if you’re yourself if you’re miserable, because it felt like she was posing the question directly to me.
Like Hannah’s, my road to getting on antidepressants was winding. Early in the pandemic, I remember telling my therapist over FaceTime that I felt more like myself when I wasn’t happy.
“You really think happiness is the point of life?” I asked her derisively. “I don’t want to be happy. I wouldn’t be me.” And then there was the matter of my creativity, the words that felt like a lifeline when I couldn’t find meaning in my day-to-day. “I can’t think of a single great writer who was happy. Can you?” I asked. I might have stumped her there. I switched therapists not too long after.
I have never met anyone like the psychiatrist I have now. She is feisty, white-haired, and spry; she refuses to medicate patients without also being responsible for their psychotherapy; and she was the first person who saw with clear eyes how much I was hurting.
I went to see her for the first time around a year ago. Light filled her living room; the space responds acutely to the weather outside, I’d come to learn. I associate her with yellow. It is the color of her house and her most often-worn sweaters.
When I sat down shivering in the chair across from hers, I spoke for nearly two hours. First, I told her the bare facts of my story: my parents’ divorce, coinciding with the start of the pandemic. A relationship-that-never-was the summer of 2020, which left me a shell of myself when he left for college. How I’d end most nights that fall tangled in tears and sweaty sheets in my bed — I could never quite tell which salt I was tasting. How I took to crying on the floor of my shower during the winter and the floor of my kitchen in the spring.
I suppose on some level, like Hannah, I knew it wasn’t normal. But sometimes it’s really difficult to figure out what isn’t until after the fact.
I told her how, in the summer, I decided I was done with that high school shit, I was done being a pathetic mess who couldn’t sort out the air in front of me enough to figure out what was real and what wasn’t. Things were better, now that I was at college — college was fixing everything. That was what was supposed to happen, right?
I was having hours of anxiety-induced chest pain a day, of course, and I felt like my life was happening behind a sheet of glass. But I was trying, I really was. I needed her to understand that I was trying so damn hard.
She did understand how hard I was trying, perhaps more than anyone ever had. But she also wondered why I thought life was supposed to be like this.
“Are you happy?” she asked.
“No,” I said.
“Why haven’t your friends or family told you to get help?”
“Well, I’m really very high-functioning,” I told her, “it’s not like my grades have slipped or anything.”
“Do you think you might ever be happy again?” How could I say no without giving myself away?
By the end of the session, she’d diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. Those words terrified me — do diagnoses make things final? They were also a second chance I never thought I’d get, a way of containing the overwhelming feeling of gray I thought would define the rest of my life. I walked out of the session into a different world. The clouds sat thicker over my head, but my legs were lighter underneath my body.
I decided to call my mom. “Yeah, she thinks I’m really depressed. Like, really, really depressed. And she wonders why I didn’t ask for help before this. She says she normally doesn’t prescribe medication during a first session, but she could see how much pain I was in, so she just called in a script to CVS. It’s for Effexor. I have this feeling that things might be about to change for real, but I can’t explain or trust it.”
By that point, I didn’t know who I was without my suffering. If some pill took it away, would there be anything left?
James I. Hudson, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Biological Psychiatry Laboratory at McLean Hospital, points out a cultural association between creativity and depression. “It’s the stereotype of the alcohol-addicted singer who is crashing,” he says, “but they’re great on the stage. Well, that’s creative. But is that the kind of creativity that we want to foster?”
His words reminded me of how Hannah’s pre-Zoloft desire to be a writer stemmed partially from her unhappiness. It made me wonder to what extent I had tied together my own tendency to feel deeply, my misery, my capacity to romanticize that pain, and my value as a human.
By the time I walked into my psychiatrist’s office, I’d let my emotions become so overwhelming — out of fear that I’d lose my essence, my self that could write through pain — that I stopped being able to actually process them. No more feelings for you, my body said. It shut down and masked them with anxiety instead. It didn’t matter if I was myself; I was miserable. I wanted desperately to be able to feel again, just not so much that it sent my nervous system into overdrive.
Seven tumultuous weeks after I took my first pill of Effexor, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor — or SNRI — that tackles both depression and anxiety, the medication started kicking in, and I sent my mom a rambling text. “It’s just a lot easier to get out of bed, do normal things, be excited for my day — music feels different, the outside world looks different. I think I had just accepted that life was going to be fundamentally worse now/never go back to normal, but I feel like my real life is starting again & I just woke up from a very long nightmarish dream.”
My journey back to myself had only just begun. But my Effexor offered me a kind of strange bridge through the glass wall between me and my life, an invitation to step back into my body and see if I could bear what I found.
GRW: Here’s something I never told Kate: The conversation we had in the Currier’s dining hall was only possible because of Vyvanse, a stimulant.
I am diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. Without stimulant medication, my mind wanders, and I follow it. A ski patroller could be explaining how to climb in the rescue toboggan, I could be beholding a beautiful work of art, or a friend could be divulging a closely guarded secret, and still, my mind will wander. In its “natural” state — one unaffected by Vyvanse, at least — my mind is slippery, and I will only process the first few words of what someone says until, all of a sudden, I find myself lingering in a days-old joke or sorting through what could next keep my mind engaged and present.
The solution? One compound made of 17 carbon, 33 hydrogen, three nitrogen, seven oxygen, and two sulfur atoms. I take 30 milligrams every morning. Over the course of about an hour and a half, it reacts primarily within my bloodstream and transforms into amphetamine, the key active ingredient in Adderall.
Vyvanse is a miracle. It makes my mind sticky, providing an incredible opportunity: to focus. The medication has allowed me to apply myself in my work at Harvard and enabled countless other meaningful experiences. I am grateful for it.
But here’s why I never told Kate: I’m not sure that the person who was sitting across from her in the dining hall was me. Was it cheating? Without Vyvanse, I am not as able to whittle away at the same few concepts for hours. So was my engagement “natural”? Was the conversation and all that followed from it artificial?
Unlike antidepressants, whose effects take weeks to take hold, the lifespan of Vyvanse and other stimulants is hours long. The shape of my mind is fundamentally different in the morning, before I take my medication, and in the afternoon, when its effects have taken full force.
“It’s kind of a blunt instrument in medicine,” Hudson says of stimulant medications. “It doesn't feel quite natural. It's an unnatural balance.”
“We’re not trying to achieve an artificial thing — it is artificial, a little bit — but the ideal thing is to maintain a homeostasis, a biological resetting of the natural rhythm of things,” he says of the intention and effect of stimulant medications. But he emphasizes that stimulants are far from perfect. “They’ve been around since the ’50s. We haven’t improved upon them,” he says, adding his surprise that no better drug has come about since then.
Taking Vyvanse often does feel like a “blunt instrument.” Ironically, one of the main challenges dovetails the primary benefit of Vyvanse: becoming unable to pull my mind from certain thoughts.
Vyvanse might keep my mind stuck in a four-to-five hour conversation that began as nothing more than a “quick lunch.” I barely budge, my mind unable to pull away, even as I know the U.S. Men’s National Team is playing Wales’ in the World Cup and I would otherwise want to go watch, even as I know class is beginning soon. Vyvanse might also stick my mind to anxious thoughts, pushing me to question again and again whether I know an acquaintance’s name, for example.
The medication also leaves me with headaches. Around eight to nine hours after taking Vyvanse — which lasts for as many as 12 to 13 hours — my brain sometimes starts to feel the “blunt instrument” in force. It tightens, stretches, implodes, contorts, warms up, and bursts into flames, often leaving me in desperate search for a bag of ice to hold against my forehead.
The headaches do have a remedy: another pill, Sumatriptan, which took me years of trial and error to discover. I swallow 50 milligrams of it whenever the headache starts, and, almost always, within an hour, a peaceful clarity replaces the sharp tension in my brain. At the very least, it makes the solitary, nasty, and brutish experience of headaches a short one.
But the other side effects — the heightened anxiety, appetite loss, sweating, and trouble I sometimes have falling asleep — have no remedy, and Vyvanse remains a complicated positive in my life.
I was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia in sixth grade following years of apparent struggles to keep up with my classmates.
My mom confirmed this memory. “You were working so hard but struggling to finish assignments on time and struggling to perform up to your potential,” she said, adding that she knew “there must be something going on.”
(“You were, and are, obviously a genius,” she also said. Thanks, Mom.)
Since my diagnosis, I have tried countless medications before settling — at least for now — on this imperfect combination. Even still, my early morning encounters with the orange-and-white capsule are strange. I stare at it, in awe of its power to shift the very tectonic plates of my world, and I consider. Do I really need my mind to be sticky today, and will I get a headache? Do I have Sumatriptan in my backpack? Is it worth losing access to my “natural” mind, to my “real” self?
Then I toss the pill in the back of my mouth and swallow.
KSG & GRW: For all its complicated miracles, psychiatric medication works differently — or not at all — for every person. For Alan, the SSRI Prozac provided no respite from either the depression or anxiety for which it was prescribed.
Instead, it made everything worse.
He describes his experience with Prozac as “scary” and “weird.” It transformed him into an entirely different person, he says, one who occupied the same body as his old self but was otherwise removed from it. Joy, pride, and excitement evaporated from activities once filled with them, and he watched life unfold from a distance. He could understand when an event or activity should have brought about an emotion, but he was unable to feel any.
“Everything was just kind of flat. I had no motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and I didn’t want to kill myself,” he says, letting out a dry chuckle, “but I also didn’t want to get up and do stuff.”
Even if the medication muted his depression and anxiety — and even if it kept him alive amid suicidal feelings — Alan was firm: Prozac did not make him better.
“It’s a loss of fundamental humanity,” he says of his experience with the drug, and it left him feeling “more alien and weird and horrible than before.”
Eventually, Alan switched to Zoloft, which was marginally better, and Ativan, a sedative, before resolving to stop using psychiatric medications altogether. He leaned on cognitive behavioral therapy, which he began at the same time as Prozac.
When he left for Cambridge to begin freshman year, he stuffed three months’ worth of Zoloft and Ativan in his suitcase, just in case. And during his first year, the supply stayed there, untouched. He recalls this time fondly. His depression receded, and he was functional.
But as Alan returned to school this fall, tragedies rippled through life at home and in school, and he couldn’t sleep for more than a few hours — often, he couldn’t sleep at all.
He stopped taking care of himself and eventually realized that he was back in the throes of depression. He says he didn’t feel “in control anymore.”Meanwhile, Ativan was still waiting in his suitcase, offering what he thought of as a “tempting lie”: the “promise of a short-term fix.”
In late September, Alan took a pill of Ativan. It was the first time he had used a psychiatric drug since he quit, and he began taking it habitually. The sleep it offered was poor. It would knock him out for nearly 14 hours, but left him extremely groggy during the day.
During winter break, he threw away all his medication and has come to embrace the imperfect reality that life without prescription medication has provided. His depression eased by spring semester, and he now logs about four to five hours of sleep per night.
“Even at my absolute worst worst, I don’t think I ever want to turn off the emotional side of things,” he says. “It’s refreshing to me to remain human.”
KSG & GRW: The variety of experiences psychiatric medication creates — highlighted by the disparities between Alan’s, Hannah’s, and our own — points to the enigma central to these drugs. The experts we talked to about this all agreed on one point: how little we know about psychiatric medicine.
Arthur M. Kleinman, a professor of medical anthropology and psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says that almost all the biological theories that have been formulated to explain mental illness “are going to look, in the future, like humoral theories from the middle ages.” Humorism, a theory that the human body was composed of four “‘humors”’ — black bile, phlegm, blood, and yellow bile — was adopted in Ancient Greece and remained the primary Western medical consensus until the 19th century.
Many researchers have nonetheless tried to elucidate the causes of anxiety and depression.“Do we have any biological models of this that are true?” Kleinman asks about the theories that have emerged. “No. Do psychiatrists tell people that they have a biological disorder? Yes. Is that an exaggeration or a misstatement? I leave it up to you.”
Diego A. Pizzagalli, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research at McLean Hospital, explains that many in the field conceptualize depression broadly using a “biopsychosocial model,” taking into account risk factors stemming from brain, mind, and society.
Psychiatric drugs like SSRIs and SNRIs — which have slightly higher efficacy rates than placebos — are prescribed nowadays to address the biological component of the biopsychosocial model, at least in part.
Clinicians began to treat psychiatric disorders with SSRIs and SNRIs when scientists thought chemical imbalances caused these disorders, a theory that has since been proved inadequate. The idea first originated from decades-old research on rabbits and mice, according to Anne Harrington, a History of Science professor. In the 1950s, researchers fed the animals reserpine, which slowed their nervous systems, before giving them antidepressants, which brought back some of their activity.
The researchers discovered that the reserpine lowered levels of norepinephrine and serotonin and that antidepressants raised them. This study, among others, contributed to the development of the chemical imbalance theory.
“What’s become more and more clear is that probably, the original animal model was a pretty poor analog to human depression,” Harrington says.
Pizzagalli explains one problem with the theory that low serotonin levels cause depression: While serotonin levels increase within hours of taking an SSRI, it takes weeks for patients to feel an improvement.
“Maybe depression is not only associated with a low level of serotonin, but there are other abnormalities, other dysregulations in different neurochemical pathways,” he says.
Similar patchwork understandings exist for other medications and disorders, like the use of Adderall for ADHD. For people with the condition, “it is somehow able to focus the brain by ways we don't know,” says Hudson. “When it works, it can work very well.”
“The introduction of drugs changed the game,” Harrington concludes, “but it didn't necessarily translate into new biological understanding as to why people get depressed and exactly how these drugs work.” The gaps in knowledge have made it difficult to develop better drugs and treatments.
Correspondingly, mental health diagnostic practices must rely on solely recognizing symptoms of a particular mental illness.
Caleb P. Gardner, a psychiatrist at Cambridge Health Alliance, explains how this runs counter to diagnostic practices for most physical illnesses. Take strep throat, for example. Sore throat, headache, and fever are symptoms of the illness, while bacteria in the throat and tonsils are its root cause. Tylenol and salt-water gargling are ways to relieve symptoms, while antibiotics attack the cause. “Lots of medications are powerful for symptoms” of mental illness, Gardner says. “But they don’t get to the bottom of what’s going on.”
This lack of clarity has leaked into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Published by the American Psychiatric Association, the DSM outlines the symptoms and diagnostic criteria for every recognized mental disorder.
According to Gardner, the DSM facilitates a “cookbook approach” in the modern delivery of psychiatric services. People report symptoms, he says, and then their presentation gets matched with a DSM diagnosis, indicating which medications they should try first. “That just isn’t adequate to addressing what’s going on for people,” he says. “And it can lead to lots of things getting overlooked.”
KSG: I spent the entirety of the first Sunday of last May in my bed, rain falling outside, humidity lacing my room. I’d tried everything — putting my legs up the wall to return blood to my heart; inhaling for four, holding for four, exhaling for four, repeating; meditatively praying to some secular god of mental illness that the terrible spiky panic-inducing feeling inside of me would ease up just a bit. I was clenching my teeth so hard that my whole mouth tasted of blood.
When I arrived at my psychiatrist’s house two days later, I knew she could tell something was wrong. I sat in my usual chair but with my shoes off and my legs in an asymmetrical twist underneath me, my arms wrapped around my waist. “So, I haven’t been doing so great.” I swallowed. “I couldn’t leave bed on Sunday. My chest, it’s still hurting right now.” I pushed into my breastbone hard. “I’m trapped, right inside here. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
She asked me why I hadn’t called her. “This is what I’m here for,” she said, her voice a mixture of desperation and frustration. “You’ve been dysfunctional. We’ve talked about this. When you can’t function, it doesn’t mean you’re failing. It means you need to ask me for help.”
She wrote up a script there and then for Ativan, a short-acting benzodiazepine. I’d done my research; I knew Ativan wasn’t like Effexor. Ativan would gradually become less effective the longer I took it, meaning I could develop tolerance.
But it was either take the drug, my psychiatrist told me, or go to the emergency room. I could not continue on as I was.
“Yesterday, the Ativan was amazing and I barely felt any anxiety all day,” I emailed my psychiatrist a few days later.“When I woke up this morning — more than 6 hours since my last dose — the anxiety was back in full force. I think I’m just feeling nervous/scared that the Ativan helps me so much; I know it’s a short-term solution,” I wrote, “but I am still feeling overwhelmed. I kind of hate the idea that I’m reliant on pills to not have a super high heart rate/chest pain, even though that might just be what it is for now. Anyway, just wanted to share!”
She reassured me that in her 30 years of practice,“no patient I have treated has ever become ‘addicted’ to any benzodiazepine.” Her patented sarcasm leaked through the screen. We’d spend time unpacking my paranoia, she said, in our next session.
My anxiety is hard to characterize. It feels as though someone has halved my lungs, poured sand down the space in my chest where breath comes in and out, turned up the dial on every one of my sensory neurons, and ordered particular muscles to contract to the point of pain. Yet it is, by definition, a psychological, not a physical, disorder. Right?
I have never once taken a pill of Ativan without feeling guilt. I know, in theory, that I’m allowed to alleviate my own suffering. But somehow, it feels different from my antidepressants; the short-acting nature of the drug makes me hyperaware of how directly it acts on my nervous system, sending a blanket of calm through my muscles until I am released into myself again. It feels like cheating to ease this paralyzing irrational tightness in my chest with medicine. It also feels like magic — which, of course, makes the whole thing even scarier. Can pills really work this easily, this well, this fast?
When I’d first heard the word “benzo” come out of my psychiatrist’s mouth, I’d imagined a mess of a middle-aged woman popping pills whenever the most minute stressor came up, pathetically incapable of facing her life head-on. It was a misogynistic and derogatory cultural narrative, and I fought against it as I tried to reconcile with the pills’ presence in my life.
I have developed a bit of a tolerance, though not nearly as much as I once feared. I’m prone to black out after one glass of alcohol, or fall asleep at 6 p.m., if I have taken the drug in the afternoon. On the not-infrequent days the Ativan doesn’t work perfectly, my anxiety dripping through the medication like a leaking faucet, my fear skyrockets.
This summer, my best friend started a highlight reel in her Snapchat memories featuring me and my chalky pills, captioned: “Kate popping a benzo in the train car bathroom. Kate popping a benzo in the art museum. Kate popping a benzo waiting for the traffic light.” I looked at the pictures recently and was caught off-guard by how joyful I looked. It seems I had integrated this despised magical aid into my life.
As of now, I take two milligrams of Ativan every morning — my chest pain is consistently the worst just after I wake — and sometimes throughout the day, meaning I am intimately familiar with my Ativan-induced guilt. But I’ve made some peace with it. I understand a little better now that it is just a relic of my outdated notion that I can beat my anxiety by sheer force of will.
I have faith that a time will come when I won’t need these chalky white pills anymore (and, to be honest, I can’t fucking wait). But that time isn’t now. I’m not cheating at life when I pop a benzo. I am trying my damn hardest to live my life the best that I can.
GRW: My junior year of high school, the anxiety that sometimes emerged from stimulant medications left me flirting with antidepressants.
I was prescribed the SNRI Cymbalta, and the experience still haunts me. I had no fears, no anxieties. I rarely experienced sadness, and I did not feel like myself.
I chronicled it all — the anxiety and the mind-altering medication — in a personal narrative for my AP English Language and Composition class dated January 2019. I addressed the reader directly, asking sarcastically what they would do if they were me, if “you lost control of your mind.”
The narrative takes “you” through the feeling of acute anxiety and panic attacks before “you” end up at the psychiatrist’s office. “He says he has this pill he doesn’t usually give to teens but he’ll give it to you,” I wrote.
Weeks later, “you can’t control your mind.” Each day feels unnervingly calm. “It feels sorta like gliding,” I wrote. “What would you do? (I ask, of course, because I don’t know what to do.)” I stopped taking Cymbalta after my junior year.
Reading the narrative now reminds me of how much I struggled and attests to how much I have grown since. My growth is a testament to my great therapist. His powerful form of cognitive behavioral therapy has given me the tools to reconstruct my mind and the course of my thoughts. To a great extent, I have overcome the anxiety and panic that cast a shadow over my adolescence.
“Everyone’s core self is GVLWIDS,” my therapist has told me countless times: “good, valuable, lovable, worthwhile, important, deserving, and strong.” I’ve been his patient for nearly a decade, and I am learning to embrace this truth more and more.
Thoughts drive feelings, feelings drive behaviors, behaviors drive thoughts, and the cycle continues. Negative thoughts, feelings, and behaviors: these often emerge from a poor self-perception, the part of me that has not yet realized that I am GVLWIDS. The good thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Those come from my good self-perception, which has blossomed.
Harrington tells us about a study that compared the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, a predecessor of SSRIs and SNRIs, with cognitive behavioral therapy. “And cognitive behavioral therapy won,” she says. “And not only that, the rates of relapse were significantly lower.” I’m not surprised.
Yet I sometimes feel as if my anxiety can prove to be more powerful than the tools that CBT has provided, which is a reality I have learned to embrace as part of my life. My experience with Cymbalta still looms over me, but my distrust of antidepressants is receding. I am recognizing how different my experience could have been, and I am coming to understand the role medication can play alongside therapy.
KSG & GRW: Rebecca’s ambiguous experience with medication has forced her to contend with what it means to summon a pragmatic faith in science, her providers, and a better world.
Her problems with mental health — including depression, anxiety, and ADHD, her current diagnoses — began in middle school, she says.
But her parents were never particularly enthusiastic about the prospect of her taking psychiatric drugs.
After trying therapy for years, she got to a point where she asked herself: “Is this really all? Is this as good as it’s going to get? Because it still isn’t awesome.” Cynicism laces her words.
Starting medication was a fairly simple decision for Rebecca. “Do I feel shitty most of the time, or do I not feel shitty most of the time?” she says, explaining the choice she faced. She wasn’t worried about losing who she was. To her, medication was about mood and motivation — nothing more, nothing less.
The process of getting on meds was rocky. The antidepressant Wellbutrin came first and immediately made her more sensitive to caffeine; she stopped drinking coffee and energy drinks. With the next medication she tried, Zoloft, came nausea; she took it at night so she could eat during the day. She did, however, notice that “it was easier to get up and start doing stuff.”
During reading week last semester, after a combination of messed-up finals period sleep schedules and forgetting to order a prescription, Rebecca stopped taking nearly all of her meds. The striking part? “I felt no different,” she says. “There was nothing.”
We asked her why she continues taking the meds. “Oh, well, fuck it. I might as well,” she says. “A doctor gave me these, she probably had a rationale. I trust her.” The faith Rebecca has is less in her medicine than in her psychiatrist and in some sort of scientific method that she knows, or perhaps hopes, is leading her in the right direction.
When Rebecca started her medications, her psychiatrist told her they would raise the floor of how terrible she felt. They haven’t done that, she says, but she recovers more rapidly from bad episodes. Though she’s not sure if that’s because of the drugs, or the passing of time, or therapy, she asks: “As long as I feel better, does it actually matter?”
“The process of getting diagnosed with something has been mysterious,” she says. “I’m not really sure what I have.” She suspects a disparity between what she’s been diagnosed with formally and what her medications treat “versus what’s actually there.” She’s hoping some clarity will emerge with time.
She recognizes, perhaps even embraces, the blind spots of her medication and the messy ways in which it works. She describes a gradual process of “making peace” with the fact that her medication won’t treat the core issues.
But unlike us, Rebecca is actively trying to care less about the mechanisms behind her pills. She rejects the idea that her meds could lead to a full recovery; she says that notion “implies a finish line that there just kind of isn’t” when it comes to healing from mental illness.
KSG & GRW: Despite flaws in the current models used to diagnose and treat psychiatric disorders, experts gesture towards a different future, one that might require a radical overhaul of how disorder is conceptualized in psychiatry and offer doctors and patients better routes towards easing suffering.
Some researchers are intrigued by how psychiatric disorders often overlap in patients’ presentations and theorize that a better understanding of their roots could stem from studying the intersection. This might be why the same medications work to treat disparate conditions, Hudson thinks. He doesn’t find it particularly plausible that SSRIs and SNRIs that are often prescribed for anxiety, depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder “would all somehow magically work in each of these conditions,” he says. “It seems more likely that somehow there were some commonalities, some common biological abnormality that might underlie a spectrum of conditions.”
Rebecca’s case — having a diagnosis on paper that she doesn’t feel aligns with her actual experiences — fits into this alternative conceptualization.
Others, like Gardner, believe that seeing patients for their individualities rather than for their diagnoses can be an avenue towards understanding underlying causes of psychiatric disorder and how medications can act on them. “To say whether or not a medication is helpful, or harmful, or productive, or regressive has to do with the individual person and their individual circumstances,” he says. To make personal treatment plans, psychiatrists need a “full picture of what's going on psychologically.”
Key to centralizing patients in their care, Kleinman says, is bringing humanity back to psychiatry.“Something deeply important in caregiving,” he says, “has been lost, is being lost.” He suggests that interpersonal care might be a reason the placebo effect has always been particularly high in psychiatry: the trust in the doctor-patient relationship “has a big effect on psychiatric outcomes.”
Despite the mild effect of her medication, Rebecca speaks highly of the close relationship between her therapist and psychiatrist. It’s nice “to have an integrated care team,” she says, “as opposed to just two separate doctors.” Her trust in her providers is, according to Kleinman’s line of reasoning, integral to the positive aspects of her experience.
The core issue is that psychiatry hasn’t defined the underlying systemic dysfunction causing mental illness, Hudson says — leaving the field with incomplete treatments. But in his mind, “even though we don’t know exactly what the abnormality is, what we’re trying to [restore] is normality — a true normality and a true homeostasis.”
“It's my fundamental belief that there is a normal self that does exist” beneath dysregulation, he says, “that normal, homeostatic self. The normal human animal.”
KSG & GRW: In some ways, our journey ends exactly where it began: we are struggling to capture in words the enigma of psychiatric drugs.
Our investigation has elucidated few real answers. The clarity we desire clashes with the very nature of pain, its randomness and its inexplicability.
How can we conclude? How do we write something that represents the humanity of those living with mental illness amidst such terrifying uncertainty?
But our friendship, once engulfed by the questions that emerged from that late -November conversation in the Currier dining hall, has finally returned to its equilibrium: ordering McDonalds M&M McFlurries at 2 a.m., and going at least a week without an all-consuming conversation about mental illness.
And we did uncover something, after all.
There is one kind of resilience we get to choose: the kind that comes from making the decision to grit our teeth and push through, to go above and beyond even and especially when we’re struggling.
And then there’s the other kind of resilience we don’t get to choose. It shouldn’t be glamorized. It feels like the hundredth minute treading water, and it often looks as inconspicuous as getting out of bed while panic spins around your head, or maintaining a conversation through a splitting headache. It is also a profoundly daring act.
Let this be a testament to every kind of resilience that the pill-taking among us display. Threaded together by some unknown hand into a messy, colorful tapestry, it absorbs the impact when we crash — over and over again — onto hard ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard pledged $6 million to finance a project between Harvard Library and the HBCU Library Alliance that will digitize and preserve African American history collections held at historically Black colleges and universities, the University’s library system announced Wednesday morning.
The project is scheduled to run for four years and is funded by Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery initiative, which received $100 million from the University to redress ties to slavery. The collaboration between Harvard Library and the HBCU Library Alliance will seek to expand public access to the archives housed by HBCUs.
Tiwanna S. Nevels, chair of the HBCU Library Alliance’s board of directors, said in a Wednesday press release that archives at HBCUs are “rich with artifacts for scholars to understand the past in preparing for the future.”
“The HBCU Library Alliance is delighted to be in partnership with Harvard University as we advance our mission to preserve and make accessible the historical legacies of these institutions,” Nevels said in the release. “This multi-year project will center itself on deepening the capacity of these historical collections through digitization.”
Loretta Parham, a co-founder of the HBCU Library Alliance who currently serves as director of the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library, said the project will build off of the Alliance’s other collaborative work over the past two decades.
“I am thrilled beyond measure about this commitment from Harvard Library and its partnership with the Alliance that will expand upon the collaborative work begun in 2007 to make our materials digitally accessible,” Parham said. “Students, faculty, scholars, and others will benefit greatly from this project.”
The collaboration between Harvard Library and the HBCU Library Alliance is the latest announcement in recent weeks by the University to implement the Legacy of Slavery report’s third recommendation, which calls on Harvard to develop lasting partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities.
Harvard announced late last month that University President Lawrence S. Bacow will appoint Ruth J. Simmons as a senior adviser to the president of Harvard on engagement with HBCUs. Simmons most recently served as president of Prairie View A&M University before stepping down from the role at the end of February.
Martha J. Whitehead — who serves as the head of Harvard Library — wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that “Harvard Library must show itself to be a trustworthy and respectful partner to the Alliance in this venture before we talk about future projects.”
“Right now, we are focused on this project, as there is still much planning to be done around the specifics of the work over the next four years,” Whitehead wrote. “The immediate next step is hiring a program director who will work with AUC Woodruff Library, the host of the HBCU Digital Library, and with Harvard Library to develop full program details.”

The Harvard Kennedy School hosted a virtual panel featuring the six finalists of the 2023 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting Wednesday afternoon.
The talk, moderated by Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy director Nancy R. Gibbs, highlighted the work of Goldsmith finalists Mike Balsamo of the Associated Press, Miranda Green for her piece with Floodlight News and NPR, Barbara Laker of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Mica Rosenberg of Reuters, Brian M. Rosenthal of the New York Times, and Anna Wolfe of Mississippi Today.
All six finalists were awarded $10,000 in recognition of their investigative journalism regarding public policy through promoting accountability and transparency in government and business institutions.
During the event, Gibbs introduced Balsamo, who was named a finalist for his team’s work in uncovering a chain of corruption and sexual abuse in the Bureau of Prisons.
“Prisoners were sent to solitary confinement for reporting abuse, and the officials in charge of preventing or investigating that sexual misconduct like the warden were themselves accused of abusing inmates or neglecting their concerns,” Balsamo said.
As a result of the investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice now “requires federal prosecutors to prioritize allegations that are made by specifically female inmates,” according to Balsamo.
The panel also highlighted the work of Rosenberg and her co-reporters, who investigated minors crossing the southern border of the U.S. into rural Alabama and discovered extensive abuse of migrant child labor in industries ranging from poultry to car manufacturing.
“In the whole car parts supply chain that supplied to the main Hyundai manufacturer in Montgomery, we found at least 10 of these plants were using underaged laborers,” Rosenberg said.
“They ultimately decided that they were going to divest their interest in the original company that we wrote about and they have also taken series of actions to try and increase oversight at all of their suppliers and to ensure that children are not hired in the future,” Rosenberg added.
Through document leaks, Green discovered that power companies were bribing media outlets including ABC News to generate a positive public outlook.
“Power & Light was using front groups — dark money groups — to funnel money to pay at least six different publications across Florida and Alabama,” Green said. “And what those publications were doing, to a varying extent, were essentially working as an echo chamber to attack people that were questioning what was happening at the two utilities.”
After Rosenthal and his colleague Eliza Shapiro heard of “low test scores” at Hasidic Jewish schools in New York City, they uncovered the standards of education and corporal punishment faced by students at these schools.
“We had heard about schools that have struggled, and schools that have low test scores. But what was really different about these schools is that they were in many ways intentionally failing,” Rosenthal said. “In many cases, they did not want to provide secular education. They thought that it was a threat to their way of life.”
“Thankfully, there’s been a good amount of impact since the story came out. You mentioned the legislation on corporal punishment that has been introduced, which has been really picking up steam in the legislature,” he added. “The State Education Commission also passed new rules for private schools and academic standards.”
During the event, Laker also discussed her experience reporting on the Philadelphia police force’s abuse of disability benefits, and Wolfe recounted her coverage of a scandal involving former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant’s alleged embezzlement of welfare funds.
The winner of the Goldsmith Prize will be announced on March 15 at a ceremony hosted by the Kennedy School.

Environmental activists discussed strategies for talking about climate change with children at a Harvard Graduate School of Education webinar Wednesday.
The event was a part of the school’s Education Now webinar series, which aims to address the evolving state of education in the United States following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Wednesday’s panel was moderated by HGSE lecturer Laura A. Schifter, who leads the Aspen Institute’s “This Is Planet Ed” initiative.
Schifter began the panel by citing an October 2022 survey by the Aspen Institute that found 49 percent of caregivers reported having a conversation about climate change with their children.
“Right now, there’s a big gap,” Schifter said, noting that 82 percent of respondents in the same survey said they feel children and young people will be “essential” to confronting climate change.
Journalist Anya Kamenetz, an adviser to the Aspen Institute initiative, said during the panel that adults may be hesitant to discuss climate change with their children due to a generational disconnect.
“Older people, for all the right reasons, feel more responsibility to address climate change than younger people do, and yet it’s younger people who are going to be experiencing it,” Kamenetz said.
Panelist Azucena “Zuzu” Qadeer, a junior at Beacon High School in New York City and an organizer with TREEage, a youth group that aims to address the climate crisis, discussed her own motivations for getting involved in climate activism as a young person.
“I think it’s a fact that climate change disproportionately affects people of color, and so I’ve seen how it’s affected people in my community, and it’s really motivated me to do the work, especially because I’m the next generation,” Qadeer said.
Qadeer said she approaches climate activism with a positive outlook, though others may look at the climate crisis in a pessimistic way.
“A lot of it is really horrible, a lot of it is really scary, but there’s a lot of good things about it. There’s a lot of hope, and there’s a lot of action that we can take to create more hope,” Qadeer said.
Kamenetz said difficult conversations about climate change are needed to confront the issue.
“I’ve come to realize that it’s not so much that we need to figure out a way to make it not scary — it’s that we need to figure out a way to have a brave conversation,” Kamenetz said. “Because the facts of climate change are quite scary, and the implications of it are scary.”
Kamenetz said caregivers should use basic language and positive examples of coping methods when discussing climate change with young children.
“With a very young child, it is enough to deliver the basic realities,” Kamenetz said. “You’re never going to talk about climate change with kids without talking about, ‘Millions of people are helping. Millions of people are trying to make a difference.’”
Kamenetz also discussed several metaphors that are useful for discussions about climate change with young children, such as a “heat-trapping blanket” covering the earth and the idea of the earth coming down with a fever.
Schifter ended the panel by encouraging attendees to take action against climate change.
“Ultimately, the way to lead us all to solutions is to start opening up dialogue about why we should all care and how we can all contribute to solutions locally,” Schifter said.

Cambridge city councilors presented a policy order on Monday calling on City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 to fund Cambridge’s Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team.
HEART, a non-police public safety alternative independent from the city, does not currently receive funding from Cambridge. The policy order, which was introduced at Monday’s city council meeting, would direct Huang to fund HEART as well as negotiate a contract to allow HEART to respond to certain 911 calls.
The policy order comes in the wake of the killing of 20-year old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge Police Department officer on Jan. 4. Faisal’s killing has led to two months of protests and renewed calls for Cambridge to explore public safety alternatives.
In an emailed statement, HEART Co-Director Corinne Espinoza addressed the policy order.
“We were heartened to learn that city council members wanted to put forth a policy order to fund our work because it makes specific strong asks of the new City Manager,” Espinoza wrote.
Last year, the council allocated $3 million in funding for 2023 to a newly created Community Safety Department — a non-police emergency response program — that is run by the city rather than existing independently.
The policy order notes that the Community Safety Department has yet to hire responders. Espinoza wrote in an emailed statement that HEART has already trained seven responders.
“Neither HEART nor CSD are ready to take 911 calls tomorrow, but our community wants to understand why the City trusts its unstaffed department and not HEART,” Espinoza wrote.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, who is one of the sponsors of the policy order, spoke in support of funding HEART at Monday’s meeting.
“The intent of this policy order is simply to put the council on record in support of the HEART initiative,” Zondervan said. “To quote Martin Luther King, ‘Justice delayed is justice denied,’ and here we are going on almost three years after the murder of George Floyd and mere weeks after Arif Faisal was killed by our Cambridge Police.”
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, who is also a sponsor, opted to use her charter right to postpone a vote on the policy order, citing concerns on interpretation of its wording.
In May 2021, Cambridge passed a similar policy order calling on then-City Manager Louis A. DePasquale to consider funding for HEART — though none materialized. Cambridge’s police alternative initiative originated in June 2020, after the city adopted a policy order calling on DePasquale to consider non-police public safety alternatives.
Espinoza wrote that they hope Cambridge passes the newly proposed order and it leads to city funding for HEART.
“The biggest barrier to HEART’s ability to take 911 calls at this moment is a lack of funding,” Espinoza wrote. “We hope the policy order will translate into funding.”

Ophelia M. Dahl, a healthcare and social justice advocate who co-founded the nonprofit Partners in Health, will receive the 2023 Radcliffe Medal in late May, the Harvard Radcliffe Institute announced Thursday morning.
Dahl will be the 38th recipient of the award, bestowed by the Radcliffe Institute on “an individual who has had a transformative impact on society,” according to the Institute’s website. The award will be presented to Dahl on May 26, a day after Harvard’s 2023 Commencement exercises.
Previous winners include author Toni Morrison, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Radcliffe Medal was first awarded in 1987 to dancer and civil rights activist Lena Horne.
In 1987, Dahl co-founded Partners in Health — a Boston-based nonprofit that provides healthcare support to populations living in poverty — alongside physician Paul Farmer, a longtime Harvard professor who died last March.
Dahl met Farmer in 1983 when she traveled to Haiti as an 18-year-old to volunteer in a school for children with disabilities. Dahl co-founded Partners in Health just four years later, and she became its executive director in 2001, serving in the role for 16 years.
During her tenure as executive director, Dahl steered the organization through the 2014 Ebola epidemic, oversaw the opening of a solar-powered hospital in rural Haiti, assisted with the response to Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, and led efforts to expand Rwanda’s health care system.
Dahl remains involved with Partners in Health as the chair of the organization’s board of directors.
Dahl, who is the daughter of renowned children’s book author Roald Dahl, also helps lead the Roald Dahl Literary Estate. The estate announced last month that Roald Dahl’s books had been altered to remove potentially offensive language, drawing criticism from some literary figures and British politicians.
A 1994 graduate of Wellesley College, Ophelia Dahl currently serves on the college’s board of trustees. Dahl also joined the board of trustees of the Clinton Health Access Initiative late last year, a global health organization co-founded by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.
In a 2006 commencement address to Wellesley graduates, Dahl urged students to avoid planning too far ahead, explaining that Partners in Health was created from a series of small steps.
“We had one specific goal: to bring healthcare to a small area of rural Haiti, to a group that had lost their land and their livelihood to a hydroelectric dam,” Dahl said in 2006.
“We didn’t have a strategy or a budget,” she added. “The lack of planning allowed us to be spontaneous, nimble, we call it, and it allowed us to react very quickly to problems as they arose.”

Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to amend the College’s language requirement and its policy on simultaneous enrollment during a virtual meeting Tuesday afternoon.
A large margin of the faculty in attendance approved both amendments, presented for discussion at last month’s FAS meeting: 93 percent of voting faculty chose to amend the policies on simultaneous enrollment and 78 percent voted to amend the language requirement.
At the meeting, FAS Dean and University President-elect Claudine Gay gave updates on the search for the next FAS dean. She also announced that she will not chair faculty meetings when she assumes her new role, calling it a practice, “I always found curious as a faculty member, and limiting as an FAS Dean.”
Gay’s announcement marks the end of the tradition of University presidents chairing faculty meetings. Earlier in the meeting, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he no longer believed that the president should preside over the monthly assembly.
Under the first amendment, students will not be able to simultaneously enroll in two courses by receiving “hour-for-hour direct and personal compensatory instruction” from the instructor of the class they do not attend starting July 1 of this year.
According to the new language requirement policy, effective July 1, students who fail to complete two semesters of a foreign language prior to the end of their sophomore year will no longer be referred to the Administrative Board. Instead, students will have an advising hold placed on them and will be required to meet with an adviser at the end of their freshman year to determine how to fulfill the requirement.
German professor Peter J. Burgard attempted to further amend the language policy to include a deadline for students to complete the requirement before senior year. The amendment failed by one vote, but was held again due to professors saying they were initially confused by the wording. It failed a second time by 20 percent.
In a written statement, Burgard wrote that he moved to amend because he saw the initial proposal as counterproductive.
“This could lead to a substantial number of students saving their foreign language study for their senior year, which defeats the purpose of the requirement, namely for students to learn a language when they will have the opportunity both to study it further if they wish and to make use of the language while still students,” he wrote.
Classics professor Kathleen M. Coleman attempted to further amend the language policy to include a deadline of completing the requirement before the start of the junior year. The vote was tied, before Bacow voted to oppose the amendment, deferring to Gay’s recommendation.
In a written statement, Coleman wrote that “if a year of instruction in a foreign language is to have any benefit for the rest of a student’s education, it should come early enough in that student’s undergraduate career.”
At Tuesday’s meeting, Gay also gave updates on the ongoing search for her successor — which was formally launched last month — saying she and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 had already met with the Faculty Council, tenure-track professors, and staff leaders. The FAS dean said the search was “still in the very early stages.”
“I really can’t overstate the importance of your input in this process,” she told the faculty, later adding that she is “committed to the success of the next FAS dean.”
“If we are successful, the next person will be someone this school and this moment needs,” she said.
Clarification: March 11, 2023
This article has been updated to clarify that University President Lawrence S. Bacow deferred his decision on voting against a start of junior year deadline for the College’s language requirement to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two medical journals, Surgery and Oncogene, retracted five articles by Harvard Medical School professors Edward E. Whang and Stanley W. Ashley, Medical School emeritus professor Michael J. Zinner, and two other researchers earlier this month and late last year.
The retractions were the result of an investigation by HMS and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which identified discrepancies in several figures used in the articles.
Oncogene — a journal for cancer-related research that shares a parent company with the scientific publication Nature — issued retraction notices for three of the five articles last month, saying, “there was no underlying research data available to resolve these discrepancies or to validate the reported results.”
Ashley, Zinner, and one of the five co-authors, Hiromichi Ito, a general surgeon affiliated with Sparrow Hospital, agreed to the three retractions, according to Oncogene. Whang and another co-author — Mark S. Duxbury, a consultant surgeon based in Glasgow — did not agree with the retractions by Oncogene.
A spokesperson for Elsevier, the company that publishes Surgery, said that after an investigation last year, HMS alerted them to two papers published in Surgery by Ito, Duxbury, Zinner, Ashley, and Whang that had invalid figures, recommending that they be retracted.
“After reviewing the materials, the Journal of Surgery Editors reached out to the corresponding authors and asked for a response,” they wrote. “The Editors were not satisfied by the explanation and the papers were retracted at the end of last year.”
Whang did not respond to a comment request about the retractions. Jessica V. Pastore, a spokesperson for Brigham and Women’s Hospital, shared a statement in his stead.
“Brigham and Women’s Hospital is committed to preserving the highest standards of biomedical research and fostering scientific innovation,” Pastore wrote in an emailed statement. “Any questions, concerns, or allegations regarding research conducted at BWH are confidentially assessed per hospital policy and federal regulations.”
Ito and Duxbury could not be reached for comment. Zinner did not respond to a request for comment.
Ashley, the other HMS professor who authored the five retracted articles, wrote that an HMS inquiry committee’s investigation found he was not personally responsible for the publication of the data and dismissed him from the investigation.
“I am not able to speak to their subsequent findings,” Ashley wrote in an email to The Crimson. “I did know that the committee had recommended retraction of the articles so I agreed with this recommendation when I was asked by the journal.”
According to Elisabeth M. Bik, a scientific integrity consultant who specializes in research misconduct, figures across the papers showed evidence of digital alteration.
Upon analyzing one of the retracted Oncogene articles about a determinant of malignant cellular behavior, Bik said that Figure 1 in that paper seemed to share gel electrophoresis lanes with data from two retracted papers: Figure 3 from another retracted Oncogene article about RNA interference targeting, as well as a retracted 2004 Surgery paper about RNA interference targeting as a strategy to treat pancreatic cancer.
“The lanes are shown in a different order and appear to contain duplications and mirroring, suggesting this image was digitally altered,” Bik wrote in an email.
“It might be likely that more retractions will follow, based on the outcome of the Harvard investigation,” Bik added.
HMS did not comment specifically upon the investigation into the articles.
“Harvard Medical School is fully committed to upholding the highest standards of ethics and to rigorously maintaining the integrity of its research,” the school wrote in an emailed statement. “Any concerns brought to our attention are reviewed thoroughly in accordance with our institutional policies and applicable regulations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year at the Ivy League Swim and Dive Championships, the Harvard women's swim and dive team (6-2, 5-2 Ivy League) took home the silver, while Harvard men’s swim and dive team (7-0) was able to win the tournament. For the women’s team, the trip to Providence, R.I. offered the chance to win the tournament in back-to-back years, while the men headed to Princeton, N.J. looking for a sixth-straight conference title.
The men’s tournament was a story of tremendous success. The victory saw two individuals, junior Will Grant and senior Umitcan Gures, each earn All-Ivy League First Team status in two events each. Five athletes were recognized as All-Ivy Second Team, and head coach Kevin Tyrrell was recognized as Coach of the Year.
“Well, I try to only think about things in terms of a team level. The Coach of the Year Award is kind of silly on two fronts. One, I never swim or dive for us. And two, it doesn't recognize the entire staff that puts this whole thing together,” Tyrrell said regarding his award.
Nonetheless, he did acknowledge that the award displayed how much the team was willing to work.
“I think it just shows that our guys really enjoy competing. They swam very well through the last day of the meet, which means they put in the work over the course of the season,” the coach continued. “We are incredibly proud of them and importantly we have some guys that will be moving on to the NCAA [tournament]. The season isn't over yet, so we're gonna keep pushing.”
Notably, Grant put on a backstroke clinic in the water, winning multiple events by almost a second each.
“He worked for it. It’s great that he makes good stuff happen for us because he cares, and he wants the team to be successful. He puts himself out there to work to make it happen,” Tyrrell said.
The head coach also stressed the importance of the divers on his team.
“Well, I think one of the big takeaways for me is just our divers. We had six divers at the meet, and they all performed either the best rounded dives on both boards or on one board. They’re really good right now, and they’ll just continue to get better,” he said.
Sophomore Adam Wesson went on to clinch his way into one of five NCAA bids, later being joined in the final round by two of his teammates.
For the women’s team, the tournament was bitter-sweet.
“We were still pretty stoked to get second, but it was obviously not ideal. Not winning means we need to reflect on what we were possibly doing wrong or reflect on what other teams were doing right,” first-year Anta Mostek said.
The main focus is on beating the Princeton Tigers, who won the HYP tournament before dethroning the Crimson in Providence.
“We’re using a fuel of dulled-down anger to bring the fight to the rest of the Ivies, but especially Princeton next year,” Mostek said.
Despite not clinching gold, this event saw numerous bright spots for the women’s squad, especially out of Mostek. Most impressively, the first-year was able to put up the fastest 100-meter backstroke time in school history, clocking in at an impressive 52.77 seconds and winning the event.
“I was against a swimmer who I raced before in our meet against Brown. I beat her but it was very close, so I was a little worried for the Ivy tournament. I gave it my all, and was extremely excited to win. But honestly, I tried my best, and I know it was my best, so I would have been happy either way,” Mostek said.
The first-year also was second in the 200 backstroke, a race where Harvard claimed the number one and number two spots. The winner of that race, senior Samantha Shelton, said it was an unforgettable experience.
“Moments before the race I was in the room with Anya and the six other swimmers in my heat. I remember laughing with Anya and we were telling each other to just have fun and go out there and see what happens,” Shelton said
The senior also had a tactic to make her last race more meaningful.
“I wanted to make it special by dedicating each 50 to all the coaches that I have had in my 14 years of swimming, with the last 50 being dedicated to coach Steph Morawski and Amanda Kulik,” said Shelton in appreciation of her Harvard coaches. “I think doing this actually helped me a lot.”
“Sammy was my training partner, and we raced each other all the time in practice. The meet was exactly what we had been practicing. I could not have done it without that support from Sammy and the whole team,” Mostek said.
Multiple Harvard divers made it to the final round of this week's NCAA qualifier, coming inches away from qualifying, but only first-year Nina Janmyr was able to clinch a spot.
Mostek’s heroics at the Ivies, paired with Janmyr’s qualification for the NCAA championships, shows the strength of the program's younger swimmers. Mostek is excited to see what the future holds for this class and the recruiting classes behind it.
“Our coach will sometimes say every day is closer to the 2024 Ivies” she said.
The men’s and women’s swim and dive teams have the NCAA championship to look forward to in a couple of weeks, the last tournament in the 2022-23 season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this past weekend’s Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) Championships, Harvard wrestling saw four members of its squad qualify for the NCAA Tournament later this month. The Crimson had an exciting weekend, featuring five podium places and earning 63 team points good enough for an eighth-place finish. The crew, which will compete at NCAA Tournament in Tulsa, Okla. is made up of sophomore Diego Sotelo, juniors Philip Conigliaro and Joshua Kim, and senior captain Yaraslau Slavikouski.
“Coach brings up every year that if you have gratitude and you have thanks, then you can’t be anxious at the same time,” said Kim, who placed fifth in the 165-pound weight bracket, when asked about the team mentality headed into the weekend.
This will be the California native’s first trip to the national tournament — and it didn't come easy. Kim faced three overtime matches over the weekend en route to the podium, one the first day and two on the second. Wrestling is a grueling sport, and even regular time matches are exhausting, but Kim feels this year's training prepared him well.
“The coaches helped me a lot. They always tell me ‘we are ready to wrestle for fifteen minutes if we have too.’ So wrestling an overtime match is still a part of the normal match to me, not an extension or something that you have to overcome,” commented Kim when asked about the matches. “If I made it that far, there is no way I can lose, right? If I can take my opponent this far into the match, then I have every right to win this match.”
Kim is excited about the opportunity to compete at the national tournament. He looks forward to supporting his teammates as well, including Conigliaro. The Massachusetts native, and 2022 EIWA champion at 165 lbs, has not had an easy year by any means. Coming in following an injury obtained early in the the season, Conigliaro fought hard to return to the mat in late February. His weekend at the EIWA tournament would not be any different — seeded seventh place at 174 lbs, he dropped his first match to tenth-seeded Ross McFarland of Hofstra.
“I just tried to keep a positive mindset and know that the training that I was able to do was going to be able to prepare me for the tournament — having a strong mentality going in is important, especially if you are going in not at one hundred percent,” Conigliaro expressed. “Losing the first match didn't give me a lot of confidence, but that's where I kind of had to step back and refocus myself.”
He then went on to win four matches in a row, placing fourth and qualifying for the NCAA tournament. This is the third year Conigliaro has qualified for the national tournament — but will only be his second time competing due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, which resulted in the cancellation of the tournament his freshman season.
The other member of the squad making his NCAA debut, despite also qualifying in 2020, is heavyweight Slavikouski. The Belarus native is ranked tenth nationally at 285 lbs, and was seeded first at the EIWA tournament. He won his first two matches before falling to Lehigh’s Nathan Taylor in the semifinals. He also defeated Penn’s Ben Goldin in the consolation match to place third overall. In addition, Slavikouski was named a First-Team All-Ivy League select and is positioned to make noise at the national tournament after not being afforded the opportunity for the past three seasons due to injury and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The Crimson’s other All-Ivy selection is 125 pounder Sotelo. The sophomore was seeded fourth at the EIWAs and won two matches before falling to first-place seed Brett Ungar of the Big Red. Sotelo finished in sixth place, enough to send the sophomore to the NCAA tournament, where he is excited to make a name for himself.
“I think me and my teammates are going out there and not many people are going to be looking our way, but we're going to make some noise and maybe to make some upsets,” said Sotelo when asked what he is most looking forward to about the tournament.
Senior Trevor Tarsi also had a great weekend, placing 4th overall. The Pennsylvania native was seeded at sixth and upset the third seed, Columbia’s Cesar Alvan, on his way to the podium. Tarsi — who will graduate this May — will leave Harvard wrestling in a much different place than it was when he came in.
While Cornell came out on top of the tournament, the Crimson qualified more wrestlers than they have in over a decade. Coach Jay Weiss, in his 29 seasons with Harvard, has coached 18 EIWA champions, and countless more place winners.
“I think that's probably the most special thing for me, and that's why I think when I'm going into this tournament — just be thankful that I'm here because a lot of people don't get the opportunity to do it,” said Conigliaro in reference to getting the chance to compete alongside his teammates.
The NCAA Wrestling Selection Show occurred last night to award the Crimson wrestlers of their fate. For the first round, Sotelo is set to wrestle Eddie Ventresca of Virginia Tech. Conigliaro will first take on Nick Incontrera of Ivy foe Penn, while Kim will take on Cole Moody of Wyoming. Harvard’s heavyweight, Slavikouski, will then take Owen Trephan of North Carolina State University to the mat. The NCAA tournament will take place in Tulsa, Okla. during March 16-18.

Lowell House is known for its abundance of traditions, which have brought together the house community for years. “Our house provides you plenty of opportunities to feel as if this is where you belong,” HoCo Co-Chair Jaya J. Nayar ’24 said. “I think Lowell really does go the distance to make Lowell House feel like home,” added HoCo co-chair Joseph E. Brower ’24. Such opportunities include Lowell Tea, which is hosted every Thursday in the Faculty Deans Residence, and Lowell Speeches during the spring semester, where students give speeches at the end of dinner. In addition, HoCo often throws steins, with upcoming themes including a (friendly) gossip-based “Heard It Through the Grapestein” stein with wine and a “Desteiny”-themed stein featuring a fortune teller.
Lowell’s community does not end at graduation. Lowell alumni can be invited to join the house’s Senior Common Room, which consists of administrators, faculty, and professionals affiliated with the house. Lowell often hosts events to connect the Junior Common Room (the house’s undergraduates) with the SCR, such as dinners and trivia nights.
If larger events are what you’re looking for, they won’t be hard to find in Lowell. Glowell is a glow-in-the-dark rave in the fall semester that’s open to all students. Additionally, Lowell hosts a Yule Ball in the fall. Nayar and Brower emphasized that Bacchanalia — a huge party celebrating Bacchus, the Roman god of wine — takes place in the spring and is one to look forward to, as it is Lowell’s biggest event.
As Lowell was recently renovated in 2019, you are likely to be satisfied with whatever housing you get. There are numerous hallway singles, especially for juniors and seniors. For sophomores, it is most common to have a suite with a double and two singles or two doubles for you and your roommates.
Lowell also has its fair share of party spaces, such as the ten-man, the nine-man, the eight-man, and the seven-man suites (who doesn’t love a good numerical order?). There is also the bell tower suite, which is completely soundproof due to its proximity to the bells. Nayar added that, though it is not a suite, there is also a room at the top of the bell tower that can be used for kickbacks or larger parties. In addition, the underground lounge is often a popular space for booking large-scale events and can fit almost a hundred people.
Lowell House boasts plentiful amenities. In terms of studying spaces, Brower said the Junior Common Room is one of his favorite study spots because you can socialize more than in a library, but it’s still quieter than the dhall. There is also a study area in the bell tower, and there are small nooks throughout the house for studying. Finally, the underground area has a dance studio, a squash court, an art room, a screening room, and a kitchen.
Want to know more about Lowell? We asked the HoCo chairs a few of your burning questions!
If you could describe your house with a HUDS dish what would it be?
JJN: By far, that cookie cake thing. Everything about us is just sweet and perfect, but we’re rare. It’s hard to get us.
JEB: Probably some sort of Earl Grey tea. It’s on brand.
How is it actually living with the bells?
JJN: I wake up at 8 a.m. every day, so I’m probably not the best person to answer. They don’t bother me.
JEB: Yeah, they've never bothered me either. I’m typically at church on Sundays until 1 p.m. either way. So I come back when they’re ringing — it’s nice and quaint.
JJN: Listen, they’re annoying, we’ll admit that much, anybody will admit that much. But the amount of joy it brings those poor bell ringers, I would not give it up for the world. It’s what they look forward to in their week.
What side of TikTok would your House be on?
JJN: We have a ton of events so we’d probably have like a thrill seeker side of TikTok.
JEB: That’s good, that's good. We’ll go with that!
JJN: Or like somebody who just looks to do a bunch of fun activities. Like one of those sides of TikTok that’s like “32 things to do with your boyfriend in New York because he can’t come up with it on his own.” That’s what we feel like when we’re in HoCo meetings.
What would you say makes your House community unique?
JJN: I think our house is uniquely good at carrying through traditions. In our house, Lowell Tea has been a standing tradition for such a long time that it’s not even a question of whether it’ll be run, it kind of just runs flawlessly at this point.
JEB: I think we do a good job at carrying through on the old while simultaneously embracing the new, like Covid didn’t like create a blip in our step whatsoever.
Is there anything else that you want to add?
JEB: The hype is…
JJN: Definitely real. For sure. I cannot imagine how much better it is to live here than everywhere else.
From fancy chandeliers in the dhall to a personal alarm clock from the bells, Lowell is here to fancify your residential experience.

There are several events to look forward to throughout the year in Quincy House. Most notably, the house’s intense, weeklong game of Assassin is a standout event that HoCo Co-Chair Kari A. Traylor ’24 looked back on as one of her favorite memories in the house. With a lengthy rule book about where and when and what you can be wearing when you shoot people (with nerf guns), the Quincy Assassin game outshines any other house-wide assassin games at Harvard thus far.
Other Quincy events, which are often spelled with Qs, include Lip SinQ, which involves choreography, costumes, and lip syncing to songs with friends. This past year, the Quincy Qarnival featured clowns, art-focused activities — such as tie dye, plant potting, and mural making — and food, including a a pizza oven and ice cream truck.
Quincy is also on the IM come up! They won the Strauss cup in the 2020-2021 academic year, and since then, they have been killing it, according to Traylor. Right now, they’re sitting comfortably in 3rd place, though they’re ready to strike at any moment.
If you’re wondering what typical sophomore housing is like in Quincy House, we have the answers for you. Most sophomores are either in the newly renovated Stone Hall or in DeWolfe, the apartment building across from the Quincy courtyard. Though you will likely be in a double sophomore year, there’s a high chance you’ll enjoy a single during your junior or senior year.
According to HoCo Co-Chair Keeling T. Baker ’24, one of the most sought-after suites in Quincy is the balcony suite above the Qube, which is known for its in-suite bar and ping pong table, making it a desirable party location. Baker and his blockmates have their eye on it for next year. Another shoutout goes to N404 in Stone Hall, a desirable six-man suite. This one is known for its spacious common room and all-singles layout. With so many options, you and your roommates will surely find an ideal suite style in Quincy.
Still have some questions you’re dying to ask? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Here’s what the HoCo chairs have to share about their house.
What do you want freshmen to know about Quincy?
KTB: I objectively think it’s the best house for its community, if nothing else. Some houses are nicer, some houses are better located, but it’s called ‘the people’s house’ for a reason, and I think the name very much still applies and that trickles down from the faculty deans to the administration to HoCo to the students.
KAT: I think Quincy is the most well-rounded house. You’ll find home here because there’s so many things that you can get involved in or events that you can go to, people that you can meet. I don’t think you’ll ever feel excluded while you’re here. You can always find people to interact with and feel like you belong here.
What makes your house special? 
KAT: I think we have one of the best mascots. It’s great for our merch. It’s great for Housing Day, lyrics, honestly great for everything. And penguins eat fish too.
KTB: That’s a Cabot joke.
What is a common misconception about Quincy? 
KTB: The main diss that other houses have is that Quincy is irrelevant. It’s just kind of a stupid diss because they can’t figure out anything else to diss us about. I mean, they still come to our dhall to get breakfast…
KAT: …and lunch, and dinner.
From hot breakfast to the Quincy Grille, Quincy residents take the saying seriously: the way to your heart if through your stomach.

With acorns as the house’s unofficial mascot, it only makes sense that Adams’ culture is nuts (*pause for groan*). The first words Adams HoCo Co-Chair Grace R. O’Sullivan ’24 would use to describe the house are “unmatched community,” and the house traditions certainly attest to this. Take, for example, Adams’ themed Thursday night Carpe Noctem events to “seize the night.” The most anticipated Carpe of the year is Chocoholica, featuring an assortment of raging students, erotic candies, and chocolate fountain lava cakes. Yet the coup-de-grace of establishing Adams’ dominant culture is certainly Drag Night, where professionals and Adams amateurs alike dress in drag for a night of fashion and fun. As Adams HoCo Co-Chair Sophia C. Weng ’24 described, “Everyone in the house gets involved—from the faculty deans to the students.” The event not only represents the superiority of Adams events, but also the tradition of inclusivity — particularly for the LGBTQ+ community — that persists throughout the house.
Even on days when you cannot party at an iconic Adams event, there is much in the house to enjoy. Check out the Gold Room (literally, a gold room) or the Bow and Arrow Printing Press. If you’re feeling hungry, head over to the castle-esque dining hall, featuring a gong (as all dhalls should have), lion carvings (allegedly bought off a movie set), and the HUDS staff who invented Boom Boom Sauce. That’s right, this HUDS staff was cooking gems long before the Great HUDS Reform of 2023. But what is best about Adams is not just that you will constantly be discovering new beauties within its walls, from stained-glass windows to dragon sconces, but that you will be exploring this alongside your close-knit Adams community.
With renovations set to finish by 2025, Adams is one of the few houses that can boast both great rooms and location. Possibly the only house where you can roll out of your bed at 9:05 a.m., clean up in your in-suite bathroom, dance around in all that space (possibly accompanied by your complimentary organ?), and walk to class in 2 minutes for your CA to begrudgingly mark you present.
Incoming sophomores will most likely find themselves in the newly-renovated Randolph Hall or the boujee swing housing of Hampden Hall and Oaktel. If they choose to venture out of their spacious, Gryffindor-esque room, they can walk through the mural-covered tunnels painted by seniors past or watch a movie in the (used-to-be-a-real-pool) Pool Theater. At night, they can also head over to the three-story Senior House, where a group of seniors lives (and obviously hosts) lively social events.
In essentially every aspect of what makes a house a house, Adams reigns supreme. The culture? Banging yet unique. The location? Ideal. The housing? Iconic in the way you dreamed about when you were eight years old and pondered what a Harvard dorm would like. And, as anybody who visits the House can attest, the community? Goated.
We know, you still want to know more about Adams. Well, learn more about it here, directly from the Adams HoCo Chairs!
How are Adams IMs going? 
GRO: We have very dedicated IM reps. They recently just got a whiteboard in the dining hall for IMs, there is an IMs groupchat for IM fanatics. Maybe it’s not a lot of people who are invested, but we have investment.
SCW: There’s nowhere to go but up!
Any pets in Adams House?
SCW: We have two corgis in the house, Cheddar and Oshie. We have a tiny little Italian greyhound who lives in the Inn named Karl Marx.
GRO: There are a lot of cats, a lot of fish, and we have a lot of tutors who host “Pawffice Hours.”
What fruit would Adams be?
BOTH: A peach.
Do you want to elaborate on that?
*exchange glances*
GRO: Peaches — they’re sweet, they’re nice, they’re great, but then…
SCW: …they’re also a little raunchy.
Cambridge may be on the East Coast, but if you live in Adams, you’ll be living on the gold coast.

It’s March 9, 2023 and you’re a class of 2026 freshman who can finally identify with one of the 12 houses. Now that you’ve gotten your decision, what’s next?
Read The Flyby Blog’s Housing Market Guide!! 
You didn’t even know Cabot was a house? Never fear, read flyby’s housing market pieces to learn more about each of the houses in depth. Annotate it. Make notes. In my unbiased opinion, this is the go-to place to find out about events held by your new House Committee and what niche things your House may offer.
Take A Self-Directed Tour
Get lost in the courtyards or the halls of your home for the next three years. Instead of doing it in the first week of class, you now get the chance to practice walking from your dorm to the Science Center, Sever Hall, or even the SEC (if you’re feeling very brave).
Bonus: Practice Running From The Quad & Back 
With 9-a.ms in your future, you may want to practice your “Crap, I woke up at 8:45 a.m. and class starts at 9 a.m.” now. Even if you’re not Quadded, the River houses are nothing like waking up at 8:55 a.m. in Canaday Hall and still making it on time for your morning lecture.
Steal Milk From the Dhall
But is it really stealing? It’s your house now. Grab the snacks, have a meal, convince yourself the food is better than Berg. Convince yourself that this dining hall is the best one on campus.
