After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Little Red Riding Hood is a story many of us grew up with; a naive girl in her famed red hood sent off to deliver goodies to her sick grandma gets tricked and eaten by a wolf. Our parents thus instructed us to not be dumb and beware of strangers, or else we would be the next Little Red.
But is it right to blame her for talking to the wolf?
It seems as though she felt pressured to do so, as most people would have been given the presence of a literal beast blocking their path. Little Red’s story is, unfortunately, a perfect allegory for rape and the abuse of power by those in control of one’s future, like a menacing wolf or a sheep-clothed professor mentoring students.
If not becoming the next Little Red was as simple as avoiding talking to strangers on campus, then one in five women would not get sexually assaulted during college. After all, 85-90 percent of sexual assaults reported by college women are perpetrated by someone they knew, so not talking to strangers won’t cut it. This makes Harvard’s toxic networking culture so dangerous; how are we supposed to land that internship if we aren’t constantly interacting with people in power? Students are continuously placed in Little Red’s shoes when we are encouraged to naively navigate the woods of networking filled with monsters we should be able to trust.
Networking is an essential skill stressed here at Harvard. Whether through classmates or professors, there is an unwritten rule that we must expand our networks right away to be successful. Even for first-years, there’s no escaping academic advisors, upperclassmen, or the plethora of Harvard websites stressing its importance. Harvard’s culture of transactional relationships plagues our ability to prioritize our comfort zones and pushes us to strive for our best work, but not always in the best way.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with networking. However, beyond having 500-plus LinkedIn connections or being on a first-name basis with your professor, networking’s toxic nature lies in the ambiguity defining student-professor relationships. When meeting someone well-respected, women, especially, need to make an effort to stand out: express interest through a smile, offer to help before being asked, or laugh at their jokes (even if they aren’t funny). Professors know we have to do this, but the nature of power imbalances continues to leave us vulnerable to wolves waiting along our paths.
One of many wolves at Harvard is John Comaroff, whose reputation as a tenured professor was solid. He worked closely with graduate students, allegedly pressuring some to be closer with him than they wanted to.
Three of these students bravely came after Harvard’s supposed sheltering of Comaroff with a lawsuit. The graduate students described the difficulties of navigating experiences that left them feeling uncomfortable while knowing that the success of their academic endeavors hinged in large part on the support of their faculty advisors. Comaroff was the wolf blocking their paths to their goals, holding them within his claws. Their future success was contingent on his control and thus their submission. Although there are some indicators that graduate students are more likely to be sexually harassed by professors, Harvard undergrads are conditioned to practice the same toxic networking habits that lead us down the same path. Just “saying no” only works if that is a viable option, and free will is near-void when a professor has so much power over one's post-graduate success.
There is no doubt that power dynamics within systems of academia perpetuate Little Red’s story. Little Red was not dumb. She was a girl who felt her only choice was bending to the wolf’s will, like students here at Harvard. Little Reds should never be called dumb for wolves getting the better of them. The lawsuit iterates against the disgraced professor that “students rarely speak out about harassment or sexual misconduct because when they do, they risk their education and their careers.” The complaint filed against Harvard accuses the University of accommodating this culture when hiring Comaroff, choosing to overlook the history of sexual misconduct allegations against him at the University of Chicago “even when warned about it.” It was not until the lawsuit materialized that loud, public faculty cheers for Comaroff were withdrawn and he was held accountable. Harvard’s complacency and silence normalize power imbalances and are thus responsible for endangering students.
In response to the lawsuit, 73 professors wrote how faculty should be demanding “more expedient, transparent, equitable, and independent investigative procedures” for future cases. As students, we couldn’t agree more. However, this only passively addresses the problem, as it implies there will indefinitely be more sexual misconduct cases to investigate. We must understand that the toxic networking culture at Harvard enables students to be taken advantage of and keeps us from speaking out – a truth that’s even more apparent with Comaroff back teaching at the college this fall. Toxic networking has to go, so we never have to worry about replicating Little Red’s nightmare again – however, its inherently insidious nature makes it seem like a world free of it can only exist in a fairy tale.

Cambridge is temporarily switching water sources after the Cambridge Water Department detected increasing levels of chemical pollutants in the municipal water supply, the city announced last week in a press release.
After the department found rising levels of synthetic chemicals — namely, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances — in an August sample of Cambridge tap water, city officials announced last Friday that the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority would supply water to the city until 2023. The switch took place Tuesday morning.
The switch will cost an additional 2 million dollars each month for the city, according to the press release.
PFAS compounds, often called “forever chemicals” for their slow deterioration and ability to remain in the human body for many years when ingested, are widely found in an array of common household goods, including furniture, food packaging, and non-stick cookware. Ingesting PFAS chemicals has been linked to a higher likelihood of birth defects, weakened immune systems, and some cancers, among other health effects, according to the CDC.
Cambridge Water Department managing director Samuel Corda said the department “took action” to ensure residents would not feel the need to “be concerned and take any action themselves.”
“No one has to be concerned about using the water or their health issues or anything of that nature,” he said of the new water plan.
In October 2020, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection introduced a regulation limiting the amount of PFAS chemicals in drinking water to 20 parts per trillion. Cambridge’s water — which flows from the Stony Brook Watershed into a reservoir at Fresh Pond and then into a treatment plant — has had PFAS levels between 10 and 20 parts per trillion since the Water Department began testing in 2019.
Corda said preliminary testing results from an August sample indicated that average PFAS levels for July, August, and September would exceed the state maximum, prompting the switch.
In contrast, the MWRA, which supplies water to Boston and Somerville, has not found PFAS compounds at detectable levels, according to testing from April 2021.
While the EPA does not currently restrict the level of PFAS compounds in drinking water, the agency announced Friday that two of the most common PFAS chemicals — Perfluorooctanoic Acid and Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid — will be designated “hazardous substances.” The EPA plans to propose an enforceable limit this fall.
Though the EPA had previously advised a limit of 70 parts per trillion of PFAS chemicals in drinking water, the agency issued a revision of its non-enforceable health advisory in June, recommending no more than 0.004 parts per trillion of PFOA and 0.02 parts per trillion of PFOS in drinking water to ensure safe lifetime consumption.
A July sample of Cambridge municipal drinking water detected PFOA and PFOS levels at 7.7 and 3.5 parts per trillion, respectively, exceeding the EPA's advised limits.
But Corda said he thought the EPA’s recommendations were “difficult to substantiate” and argued that more data and research are necessary to arrive at the “correct level.” He noted that current PFAS testing cannot detect quantities lower than two parts per trillion.
Philippe A. Grandjean, an adjunct professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who researches the health impacts of PFAS contaminants, said that the danger of PFAS chemicals lies in their long-term accumulation in the human body.
“Once they get into your body, these compounds will accumulate, and they will take years and years for you to eliminate them from your body,” Grandjean said.
Grandjean added that the most pressing health risk posed by PFAS compounds is a weakened immune function in children and newborns, who can ingest PFAS compounds both from breastfeeding and from baby formula made with PFAS-contaminated water.
Cambridge will return to using the municipal water supply after the installation of a new granular activated carbon water filter at the city’s water treatment plant.
Corda said he expects the new filtration system, set to be completed in November 2022, will filter out half of the current PFAS chemicals in the water, returning it to within legal limits.
But in a Monday interview, city councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan expressed concerns that some PFAS chemicals — including those not tested for by the Water Department — would remain in the municipal water supply and called for a “zero-tolerance” policy toward PFAS chemicals in drinking water.
Zondervan also indicated that he is considering introducing a policy order to the City Council to make the switch to MWRA water permanent, despite the increased costs to the city.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nia N. Meadows ’22-’23 is spending her senior year living in overflow housing located across the street from Lowell House — her residence of years past.
Meadows opted to move to Ridgely Hall to secure a single room for her final year at the College, rather than a double in Lowell. The singles in Lowell House were all taken before her turn in the housing lottery.
“Everyone who got a single was a senior,” she said. “The singles went pretty quickly because they're just nice.”
Students like Meadows were placed in overflow housing this year due to the record-size Class of 2025 and students returning from leaves of absence during the pandemic. All upperclassman houses except Leverett House have placed students in alternate buildings due to space constraints.
Some students have lauded the alternative accommodations as more spacious.
Kolby R. Johnson ’25, a student in Kirkland House, said his dorm in the Prescotts offers a “better housing situation.”
“The Prescotts is a bit nicer in terms of actual living facilities,” Johnson said. “It's actually just very spacious, and it feels more like apartment living as opposed to dorm living, which I kind of enjoy.”
Wamda M. Garo ’24 opted for Ridgely housing to avoid Lowell’s “extremely small” singles.
“The main thing I really wanted was a kitchen and having a really big common space also really helps,” Garo said.
Still, students relegated to overflow housing said their arrangement brings some disadvantages, citing a physical and figurative disconnect from house life.
Garo said she misses being able to walk through the Lowell courtyard as she exits her room.
“Lowell has a really beautiful courtyard, and I think every time you walk out, you appreciate it and appreciate the house,” Garo said. “It's definitely a difference — living across the street, having to make an effort to go to your courtyard, rather than just walking into it and seeing your friends every single time you walk out your door.”
Johnson’s dorm in the Prescotts is located half a mile from his assigned house — Kirkland. He must travel to another upperclassman house to eat in a dining hall.
“A major con though is obviously the walk back to Kirkland,” Johnson said. “So we’re far away from the housing community for things like food and social interaction.”
Houses located in the Radcliffe Quadrangle — once known for its spacious singles — are lodging additional students in Cronkhite Center, a former graduate student dormitory located next to the Admissions Office. Students living in Cronkhite must travel to the Quad or another upperclassman house for dining.
Still, Johnson said he considers living in overflow housing in the Prescotts to be a nice change.
“The big thing for me is as long as I am living with people I vibe with, I’m gonna have a great time,” Johnson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students flooded the Harvard campus’ paths, hallways, and buildings as they made their way to classes on Wednesday, the first day of the fall semester.
This year marks the second year since Harvard’s campus returned to full capacity and the first semester since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that Harvard is not requiring students to wear masks or test regularly for the virus.
For Brayden H. Orpello-McCoy ’24, the continuation of in-person classes meant strengthening friendships and feeling better acclimated to the College environment.
“Having been a sophomore last year, we really didn't have a real first in-person freshman year,” he said. “This felt more comfortable and more familiar.”
But Orpello-McCoy added that getting to interact with peers and professors without masks was “like navigating a new social dynamic.”
“I’ll be honest, it kind of felt awkward,” he said.
Tessa I. Conrardy ’24, a junior who transferred to Harvard last year, also described feeling more at ease on campus as an upperclassman.
“It's definitely strange coming back to campus and feeling that everything is really familiar and feeling like we're actually veterans for once,” she said.
Conrardy, who is deaf in her right ear, added that she is grateful to be able to see people’s faces without masks this year. She noted that since she relies on reading lips, communicating was “definitely tricky” while the University’s mask policy was in place.
“Especially given that I take Russian,” Conrardy said. “Really getting everything that's going on as far as every single word that everyone is saying is super, super helpful.”
Peggy Y. Yin ’25 called her first day of classes “pretty hectic” and “jam-packed,” which she said impacted her decision about whether to wear a mask in lecture. Yin explained that when she entered her statistics class, she put on her mask “because it was a lot of people packed in close quarters.”
“With masks, I think I'm probably going to stick to the side of safety for the large lectures but probably keep it off for the smaller lectures,” she added.
For some freshmen, the first day of classes brought fun, uncertainty, and minor mishaps.
Amber E. van Meines ’26 said she walked into her expository writing classroom while a previous class was still in session.
“That was a little bit embarrassing, but it wasn’t too bad,” she said. “ I just walked in, and I was like, ‘Oh,’ and then I walked back out.”
She added that the lack of a shopping week period left her “a little bit uncertain” about her choice of classes.
“I didn’t meet the professor or anything,” said van Meines. “I didn’t know what to expect.”
But she credits her academic advisor, her peer advising fellow, and her upperclassmen friends on the swim team for helping her figure out which classes to try out.
Kaia J. Li ’26 said her first courses at the College “went by pretty fast” and were not as stressful as she anticipated.
“They were actually kind of beyond my expectations,” she said. “They were a lot more fun than I thought they would be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was past midnight in Lima, Peru, but when Ana Ventosilla learned her son had been arrested at an airport in Indonesia, she called him immediately.
On a WhatsApp video call, her son, Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla, said authorities in Bali, where he was traveling on a honeymoon, were demanding up to $100,000 for his release after he was arrested on drug charges.
“Mom, I’m going to negotiate. I’m going to tell them that I [will] give them $13,000,” her son told her, Ventosilla recounted in an interview Monday.
But it did not work. Hours later, the amount had risen to $200,000, Ventosilla said her son told her.
“It was an extortion,” she said.
Three days later, Rodrigo Ventocilla’s honeymoon trip to Bali, one of Southeast Asia’s most popular and idyllic tourist destinations, ended in tragedy when he died at age 32 at a hospital in Denpasar while still in police custody. A transgender man who co-founded a trans rights advocacy group in Peru, Ventocilla was about to enter his final year as a master’s student at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The cause of Ventocilla’s death has become the source of international controversy. Police in Bali say he died after consuming unseized drugs in custody. He was arrested five days earlier when authorities found a grinder and other items containing marijuana in his possession at the I Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport, according to the Bali Police.
But his family has called into question officials’ explanation, alleging the arrest was motivated by racism and transphobia. Ana Ventosilla said in an interview with The Crimson on Monday that her son was beaten by police and received inadequate medical attention while he was hospitalized.
Ana Ventosilla said her son and his spouse, Sebastián Marallano, were subjected to “physical and psychological violence” at the hands of Indonesian authorities. The family, which is now pursuing legal action in Peru, has “evidence of torture,” she said.
Her allegations are the most severe claims of police misconduct Ventocilla’s family has levied to date, going further than an initial press release family members put out earlier this month.
“For us, it is very painful,” she said. “There is evidence of torture, and we want to clear Rodrigo’s name.”
Ana Ventosilla said her son was beaten by Indonesian authorities after he was detained at airport customs.
Ventosilla’s account of the events that transpired after her son’s arrest are based in large part on what Marallano recounted after returning home to Peru, according to a spokesperson for the family, Luzmo Henríquez.
In a statement earlier this month, Ventocilla’s family said they “do not know the real causes of his death” because an independent autopsy has not taken place. The family is calling on the Peruvian government to authorize an immediate autopsy once the body arrives in Peru on Friday.
The Bali Police deny the allegations of violence. Stefanus Satake Bayu Setianto, a spokesperson for the Bali Police, wrote in a statement Wednesday that “no violence” was carried out against Ventocilla and Marallano by police on the island.
Indonesia is home to some of the strictest drug laws in Southeast Asia. Possession of marijuana can result in a 12-year prison sentence and hefty fines.
The country has also passed several laws in recent years curtailing LGBTQ+ rights.
Ventocilla’s family has also sharply criticized the Peruvian consular services in Indonesia, charging that officials failed to provide Ventocilla and Marallano sufficient support after they were detained.
Ana Ventosilla said family members “blew up the phone of the Peruvian consulate in Indonesia” following Ventocilla’s arrest. But officials at the embassy did not provide “timely attention,” hindering the family’s request for help, Ventosilla said.
The Peruvian Foreign Affairs Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. The government initially defended its actions in a press release last week, but changed its tone after it came under fire from the families of Ventocilla and Marallano.
In a press release on Friday, the ministry asked Indonesia to produce an “official report” about the circumstances that led to Ventocilla’s death — a sharp reversal from an initial statement it put out two days prior that defended its consular services and backed up the Bali Police’s explanation of the arrest.
“The first communication was really aggravating and humiliating for us,” Ana Ventosilla said in the interview Monday. “It hurt our souls.”
Ventosilla took aim at Julio Eduardo Tenorio Pereyra, head of consular services for the Peruvian Embassy in Indonesia, saying he refused to fly to Bali from Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, even as Ventocilla’s health deteriorated.
Tenorio told family members they needed to submit paperwork before he could travel to Bali, where Ventocilla and Marallano were being treated in local hospitals, Ventosilla said.
On Aug. 11, Tenorio agreed to take the next commercial flight to Bali, according to Ventosilla. Two hours later, she received word her son was dead.
After Ventocilla’s family informed Tenorio of the news, he delayed his trip to Bali, according to Ventosilla. He told them he would not travel to the island until after a death certificate was issued, she said.
“That’s what he writes to me,” Ventosilla said. “Not even the slightest, ‘I’m very sorry, ma’am.’”
