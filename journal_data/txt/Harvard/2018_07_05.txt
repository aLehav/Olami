After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in a swanky conference room shielded from the hubbub of the construction that marred the iconic facade of the Eliot Hotel, I kept wondering whether Bo Burnham was performing. The comedian was in a roundtable interview about his screenwriting and directorial debut, “Eighth Grade,” so a certain amount of performance was to be expected. A more extensive concern, however, is validated by the fact that Burnham, 27, has spent the majority of his life performing and talking about performance.
“Eighth Grade” demonstrates that this theme continues to dominate Burnham’s work. The film follows Kayla (Elsie Fisher), who, like most eighth graders, is at once very average and incredibly special. With a backdrop of dramatic electronic music, which Burnham wanted to “make you feel what she’s feeling, which is intense,” Kayla struggles to make the best of the last week of a trying middle school experience. She has a YouTube channel, with an unspecified but likely tiny number of viewers, in which she doles out simple, innocent life advice that she rarely seems to follow herself.
In Fisher, Burnham found himself the perfect Kayla. Shy, kind, and always passionately real, she is what makes “Eighth Grade” as emotional and true-to-life as it is. For Burnham, her character was more of a discovery than a creation: “She was pretty there. Part of it was just, ‘I want what you’re doing to be in the movie. How can we do that?’” The key to his direction, Burnham said, was “giving her permission to fail on camera, and stay natural. When she came in, she was so alive and fresh and new and nervous and interesting, and [we] had to [figure out] how do we rehearse and prepare and still maintain the chaos that made this work.” Burnham clarified that it wasn’t just her newcomer status that made her the perfect fit for the role: “She’s just really good, too...and didn't have to be tricked. She just has an innate ability to be incredibly natural on camera. Every other kid I saw felt like a confident kid pretending to be shy, and she felt like a shy kid pretending to be confident, which is the whole role.”
Like Kayla, Burnham also got his start on YouTube, rising to prominence at a young age. But he deliberately wanted to distance himself from his protagonist. Burnham emphasized that he “didn’t want to make a nostalgic story. I like nostalgic movies about this age, but [the main character] being a girl was like, I couldn’t project my own experience onto her.” Indeed, one of the main reasons Burnham wanted to make a film was to explore the themes in which he’s interested without focusing on himself. “I was very tired of myself as a subject,” he said, later adding that he wanted to “talk about the internet with someone who doesn’t go viral, with someone who’s not noticed...talk about all the things—performing, anxiety—for people that don’t have an audience.” By the end of the film, Kayla diverges from Burnham’s own path, and is happier for it.
More than just in Kayla’s videos, technology is ubiquitous throughout “Eighth Grade.” She is on her phone nearly constantly, and in several eminently relatable scenes, lies awake at night, her face haloed by the light of Instagram on her phone. The film strives to realistically depict how young people actually use technology. Burnham wanted to stay away from making the type of blunt, blanket statements about technology that litter mediocre modern movies. “I think sometimes when older filmmakers and other people try to integrate technology it’s seen as this big, outside thing, so they shoehorn it in and it like, very loudly announces itself. And to me, it just is part of my life. So, it’d be like asking, ‘Why’d you put shoes in your movie?’ Because people walk around. And I think you’ll see more of that as young people start to make stuff. You’ll see the internet integrated in a way that’s a little more subtle than a fucking Taco Bell commercial.”
Beyond that, Burnham wanted to show the paradoxical nature of our relationship with the internet and technology. “We’re hyperconnected and we’re lonely. We’re overstimulated and we’re numb… It’s not meant to be like, ‘Man the internet makes us lonely and awful. [Kayla] should throw her phone in the ocean and be happy.” Throughout the interview, Burnham made clear that he never wanted the film to be preachy on any subject. In discussing a scene in which a high school boy sexually harasses Kayla, he said, “It was trying to portray a certain type of thing that when described after the fact might not sound like a big deal. ‘What, he sat in the back seat, he touched your arm, you said no, what’s the big deal?’ It doesn’t need to go that far to be bad, to be violating, to be violent.” Still, he reiterated that “the movie itself is hopefully supposed to inspire thoughts like that rather than prescribe thoughts like that.”
Similarly, when talking about a scene in which Kayla’s school has a school shooter safety drill, he emphasized that he included the sequence simply for realism’s sake, rather than to make a political point. “I wrote that three years ago and the lockdown was in there, I didn’t think I was being political when I wrote it then, all of a sudden it’s political.” Burnham summed all this up by saying, “The hope is just to be honest with it, and portray the sort of background noise of [the characters’] life which is incredibly sexual and insane, and portray their inner life through that, which is a kid, navigating the world where things are exploding and the country’s on fire.” In regards to all these issues, he made it clear that “I’m not here to give a TED Talk.”
Talking about his post-”Eighth Grade” future, Burnham avoided specifics. “I try not to think of my career. Once this is out, I’ll be able to sit back and try to think of something else to do. I’d love to do another movie. I’d love to, love to want to do stand-up again, but I don’t want to right now… It’s just fun to work with other people.” Burnham has been on a hiatus from comedy since “Make Happy,” his most recent stand-up special, was released on Netflix in 2016. The end of that piece, notable for its thoughtfulness on anxiety and performance as much as its humor, shows Burnham walking out of a darkened room into a sunny, verdant yard, after asking both his audience and himself, “Are you happy?” The anxiety and depression that forced him out of comedy still are topics in his art, but not being center stage anymore seems to be doing Burnham some good.
In that conference room, Burnham seemed mostly relaxed. As someone who has seen his face countless times, being in the same small room as Burnham felt strange, as if for a moment we were bridging the gap between entertainer and audience that always pertains, often despite his best efforts. Towards the end of “Make Happy,” he brings the house lights up, and tells his crowd, among other things, “If you can live your life without an audience, do it.” So, sitting across from him, I couldn’t help but wonder whether he had managed to achieve this dream, and if that’s even possible for someone like him. Still, a consummate performer and entertainer, Burnham seems to have found some peace in his new role: director.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last shot of “After,” the previous episode of “Handmaid’s Tale,” is a closeup of June (Elisabeth Moss) clicking a pen. The act signals the start of the rule-breaking that drives the eighth episode, “Women’s Work”: In Gilead, it is highly illegal for women to read or write—“[Serena] writes, I read. This is the new normal. And an offense to God,” June muses—setting off a domino effect that sees June use her tenuous friendship with Serena to help Janine (Madeline Brewer), who has recently returned from the Colonies, and Serena’s taste for well-intentioned disobedience grow, then get brutally beaten out of her.
As always, June must balance the thin line between surviving in the Waterford household through obedience and exerting what little freedom she can find in its cracks. For the first time, however, the two become one as June edits the documents Serena (Yvonne Strahovski) forges in her husband’s name. By obeying Serena, June exercises a right of which she has long been deprived, one she very clearly misses. Their nightly routines are the foundation for the growing civility and mutual respect Serena and June come to have for one another, but they also represent June’s inadvertent help to Gilead, the very government working to suppress her and all women living under its jurisdiction. It’s a dichotomy that puts June in a gray area, but also one she’s already grown familiar with: she grappled with her feelings for Nick and her love for her husband to when she attempted to escape Gilead, leaving her daughter behind. But for Emily, surviving the Colonies has made everything black and white; she would be quick to condemn June if she were ever to discover June’s betrayal, as June is made well aware after overhearing a conversation between Emily and Janine. “Anyone helping Gilead deserves to be blown apart,” Emily asserts.
“If Emily knew that I helped cover for the Commander (Joseph Fiennes) with Serena, would she want me dead, too? I can’t say I blame her. Stay in Gilead long enough and it starts to eat you from the inside out. That's one of the things they do. They force you to kill, within yourself,” June thinks. What Emily doesn’t realize, though, is that June’s deception is ultimately what gives her the leverage to come to another handmaid’s aid, Janine. Rumor has it that a child has fallen ill, a potentially devastating misfortune considering how few children survive to birth in the first place. The kicker? The child is Janine’s daughter, Charlotte—or as her former Commander and his wife have decided, baby Angela.
The symbolism is both subtle and striking: While the Commander is soon to return from the hospital, still recovering from the bombing, Angela is rushed there, having fallen ill to an unknown disease in the Putnam’s care; where the Commander is one of the most powerful men in Gilead, Angela, not only a baby but also a girl, is the most helpless; where the Commander’s absence empowers June and Serena as women, Angela’s empowers them as mothers, a role that is at the heart of what Gilead distorts. Indeed, by putting Serena in a tug-of-war situation where she must choose between obeying her husband and following her gut, the writers astutely focus this episode on motherhood, what women would do for their children, and what they would want others to do for their children. “I think, if it were my baby, I would do whatever I could. Law or no law,” June tells Serena, who knows there is one illegal option left unexplored that could potentially save Angela. It’s a test for Serena, one of her first as the soon-to-be mother of June’s baby: How far will she go to protect a child? If she won’t do everything in her power, how will she be a good mother?
For once, Serena rises to the occasion. And that’s how, after a handmaid is given a pen, a Martha (Karen Glave) is given a stethoscope. The episode’s fast pace drives one role reversal after another: June can make requests of her superiors, Serena and Aunt Lydia, on her friend’s behalf, Serena can give a Martha back part of the identity that Gilead has stripped away, and said Martha can reclaim her title as the best neonatologist in the country. But as in earlier episodes, the denouement and the events leading up to it are too easy. June’s emotional manipulation of Serena is inconsistent with the latter character’s calculating nature. The Putnams welcome Janine back into Angela’s life with barely any resistance.
Despite the character-related inconsistencies, the episode upholds its themes well. just as Charlotte heals and starts to thrive again, so does the Commander. His recovery turns the Waterford home back into the prison that it is—only this time, it’s Serena’s turn to face the consequences of disobedience. Her beating illustrates what discipline, when taken to the extreme, can look like, and is a turning point for Serena, whose character had shown signs of improving. And this is where the writers’ genius seeps into the show: The Commander’s punishment acts as the final role reversal of the episode. Humiliating and dehumanizing, Serena’s whipping forces her into a position not unlike the handmaid’s, one in which she can only helplessly submit to her Commander’s brutal assault. Her punishment is perhaps the final nail in the coffin of the dwindling relationship between she and her husband, and marks the end of her short companionship with June, who has learned by now how to deal with swift change to protect herself from the very people she might have called friends just hours before. But as she falls to her hands and knees in front of the Commander’s office, it’s obvious that adapting to such changes hasn’t gotten any easier.

Worlds collide in the ninth episode of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Smart Power.” On a diplomatic mission for the Gilead, the Waterfords cross borders and visit Canada, a part of North America that hasn’t devolved into conservative extremes and is still tentatively civil with their neighbors. It’s a smart move on the show’s part, as the world of Gilead and the Waterford home is already purposefully stifling for its characters (and perhaps, its viewers), who are simply visitors to the confining landscape. The second season has been teasing us with hard-earned possibilities of escape and cuts to Moira’s (Samira Wiley) life in Little America. And now, it’s finally giving us a satisfying and refreshing episode that forces Gilead’s creators to step outside of their comfort zone and reckon with what they’ve done.
It’s not just the setting change that revitalizes the show. If anything, Serena’s (Yvonne Strahovski) interactions with Canada are the truly fascinating and heartbreaking parts of the episode. In the first part of the episode, Serena looks outside the car window as she drives by people walking casually in the streets, a couple kissing with little regard for bystanders, and buildings absent of security guards. Serena gasps a little, a small but powerful gesture. This scene is cleverly lit, washing over Serena’s wonder-filled expression and the outside world in a hazy, dreamy light. Sometimes it moves in slow motion. It’s beautiful, but also a little sad—this world can’t be a reality for Serena.
And it’s sort of her fault. Little by little, the show starts to piece together the obvious truth that haunts Serena—that her pre-Gilead actions were never necessary to keep what used to be America alive. Though she waxed poetic about the dangerous situation the world was in (how birth rates were rapidly declining), it becomes increasingly clear that her and other conservatives’ methods were more than extreme. Serena is handed a schedule with no words—just simple pictures—by a presumably high-ranking Canadian woman who loves to read in her free time and studied French literature in college. Serena meets a child who asks Serena if she’s a princess, the go-to role model for young girls. Both Serena and girl's mother know that answer is undeniably, “no.” Serena and the pair choose to take separate lifts, despite Serena’s reverence for children. There’s so much brilliant and subtle irony and condescension wrapped up in these moments. This world exists with the freedom and equality the Waterfords fought to take away and may very well continue to do so despite whatever apocalyptic chaos is on the horizon.
Meanwhile, in Gilead, June (Elisabeth Moss) struggles to come to terms with Serena’s recent announcement—that June will not be staying to breastfeed the baby after giving birth, meaning June won’t be able to see her at all. She takes precautions to make sure that her child will grow up with protection in a violent household, calling upon Rita (Amanda Brugel) and Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) to be her makeshift godmothers.
But that may not even be necessary. Towards the end of the episode, Nick (Max Minghella) and Luke (O. T. Fagbenle) meet. Nick passes on the letters written by the women of Gilead—the ones June thought she burned when she was still in her stress-induced delirium. Luke publishes them online, and Canada gets angry. The diplomatic mission is cut short, and the Waterfords are booted back to their own country.
Change is coming for Gilead, whether the Waterfords want it or not. This delightful plot progression is perfectly paced in time for an explosive Season Two finale and a fitting preface to Season Three. “I know I should accept the reality of you being born here. Make my peace,” June thinks to her baby. “But fuck that."

The second installment in the “Jurassic World” series and the fifth in the “Jurassic Park” franchise, “A Fallen Kingdom” (directed by J.A. Bayona) falls out of the originally iconic kingdom Steven Spielberg created in 1993.
The dormant volcanoes on Isla Nublar have become suddenly active, threatening to end all life on the island and render the dinosaurs extinct once again. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) runs an activist organization called the Dinosaur Protection Group whose mission is to save the dinosaurs from the island. In her first appearance in the film, Bayona zooms in on her heels, perhaps a nod to the last Jurassic World’s sexism, though this time Claire sports a ponytail and some more outdoorsy shoes on the island. Failing to get government support, Claire is overly thrilled when she receives a call from the Lockwood Estate, where the aging and elderly Ben Lockwood (James Cromwell) recruits Claire on a mission to save the dinosaurs from Isla Nublar and relocate them to a different island. With a difficult task ahead, Claire recruits ex-boyfriend and dinosaur trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), the only person who can help with the capture of the last remaining raptors alive, Blue.
The rest of the scrappy gang consists of Franklin Webb (Justice Smith), the nerdy and easily-spooked computer programmer from Claire’s organization on the venture, and badass biologist Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda). Franklin’s intense fear of dinosaurs gives way to screaming matches, his squeals so high-pitched they rival the dinosaurs’ roars when they face each other, squeezing out some of the only genuine laughs in the film. Lockwood’s assistant Eli (Rafe Spall) reveals his malice pretty early on, with his smooth flowing words and slick charisma. The other bad guys couldn’t be more obvious and lack any real villainous lure or remarkable traits. So when some (or all) of them get devoured by the dinosaurs, there’s little feeling, neither excitement nor sadness.
On the island, it quickly becomes apparent that not everyone in Lockwood’s large endeavor is there to save the dinosaurs out of the goodness of their hearts—they’re there to sell them to the highest bidder who wants to weaponize them. The only dinosaurs that make lasting impressions are everyone’s favorite raptor, Blue, and some new genetically-engineered monster, the Indoraptor. The highlights of the film are easily Owen’s moments with Blue—the human-animal connection in the videos of Owen with baby Blue turn the ultrasmart and sharp killer into a cute puppy.
Just like John Hammond in the Jurassic Park trilogy, Lockwood proves to be a complicated and problematic character. However, except for an opening scene where Lockwood reveals his plan to save the dinosaurs from the island to Claire, Lockwood is bedridden and makes few appearances. Cromwell’s detached portrayal is rather disappointing and shallow, and Bayona fails to create an icon out of Lockwood with the sparse clips, which his large estate and shadowed legacy may otherwise suggest of his role. Richard Attenborough, who played Hammond throughout the series, passed away in 2014, leaving a hole in the film that Bayona clumsily patched with the insertion of Lockwood.
On the topic of awkward replacements, after the destruction of Isla Nublar following the volcanoes’ explosion, a fair portion of the film—including action scenes—takes place indoors in Lockwood’s mansion. Maybe Lockwood has the gazillion dollars to own a house that size, but still, tens of giant formerly extinct creatures roaming throughout and underground such a mansion looks ridiculous in the setting. An unbelievable kind of ridiculous, and not quite in a funny way, either.
Lockwood’s inquisitive and mischievous young granddaughter, Maisie, starts out pretty lovable. Isabella Sermon is charming in the role and shows maturity far beyond her years, until her words and actions extend beyond the realm of believability, to the point of inconsistency.
Bayona raises the central question of humans exploiting scientific research in several critical moments, but the movie lacks development and exploration of this concept, leaving much to be anticipated—or, little to be anticipated—for the last film in the trilogy.

The former Disney star is known for wearing a lot of hats—she’s acted in glossy teen dramas like “Lemonade Mouth” and “Jem and the Holograms” and is also a singer-songwriter who just released her synth-pop debut studio album “Expectations.” As if those feats weren’t enough, Hayley Kiyoko can also dance, and getting to see that live is a blessing. It confirms that Kiyoko is a natural performer, spinning around on the stage and rolling her hips with a cool charisma, always smiling slyly at the crowd. At one point in the night, the audience started chanting “Go Hayley, go Hayley,” as if they were cheering on their classmate in a high school gym glitzed up for a homecoming dance, and not at the Paradise Rock Club with dozens of strangers.
That’s part of both Kiyoko’s incredible stage presence and her political power. It’s easy to feel comfortable with her when Kiyoko is actively trying to make everyone in the room feel that way. “Everyone in this room loves you, supports you,” she said, and the crowd of strangers cheered, reaffirming her statement. From the balcony, someone waved a rainbow flag, sending ripples through its stripes. The weight of Kiyoko’s words extend beyond just general statements of well-being—they have social significance too when said by the Internet’s “Lesbian Jesus.” And Kiyoko isn’t coy about her new title. “It’s pride month,” she exclaimed, and the crowd went wild again.
The second song of Kiyoko’s set was “Girls Like Girls,” a risky choice considering it’s one of Kiyoko’s most popular hits, potentially fizzing out the concert with energy early on. “Girls Like Girls” tells the story of a girl stealing another girl away from her boyfriend: “Tell the neighbors I'm not sorry if I'm breaking walls down / Building your girl’s second story / Ripping all your floors out.” It’s an anthem for all the “girls [who] like girls like boys do,” both iconic and revolutionary for being so explicit about being a lesbian love song. There is no coded language, and that’s what makes it so refreshing and necessary. During the song, Kiyoko played the “Girls Like Girls” music video, which starred two Disney actresses—Stefanie Scott and Kelsey Chow—as the romantic duo. In other words, she projected two stars of a company that has a longstanding reputation for being a symbolic American, “family-friendly,” childhood staple kissing as a lesbian couple on screen.
Playing “Girls Like Girls” early might have seemed like a bad idea—why not save it for an electric finale?—but it was smart. Kiyoko set the tone early on with both the video and song. She made it clear that masks weren’t necessary if you didn’t want to wear them, that the stereotypical relationships seen on your childhood TV screens didn’t need not be followed—especially not in the space she carved out at the Paradise Rock Club.
Because Kiyoko lays her heart out, she makes it easy to forget about the daily stressors of the outside world as you sing along to her music or when she divulges intimate accounts of her own love life. “So when I was writing this song, I was seeing this girl at the time. And she was just so...annoying!” Kiyoko said to the crowd. “She just kept playing with my emotions. Do you guys mind if I go off on her for a second?”
But of course, for this multi-talented musician, that meant launching into song, her form of a vent-session. “Who are you trying to trick? Why don't you just cut the shit?” Kiyoko yelled into the microphone, a cathartic act that the audience happily joined. “...Girl, why can't you just be honest—with yourself?”
That’s when Kiyoko pulls back the “one-of-us” veil and casually reminds us that she’s “Lesbian Jesus” not just because of the content of her songs, but also because she’s just brilliant at performing them. Kiyoko used to act in Cinnamon Toast Crunch commercials and play in a garage band called Hede. Now, she’s a LGBTQ messiah who can go wild on the drums if she wants to, who can bounce around the stage with endless energy, who can sing immaculately as if her voice were coming straight from an environmentally-controlled studio. “Watching from above the endless party / California, just a bad dream / I won't hang around until you want me,” she sang, a video of palm trees blooming in a kaleidoscope pattern behind her, her voice dreamy, effortless, smooth.

Mitksi wants you to dance in “Nobody,” her dreamy, disco-pop love song about solitude. It’s easy and instinctual to wallow when you’re lonely, but Mitski’s asking you to do the opposite. Her latest single, accompanied by a similarly cheery music video, is eerily upbeat, with melancholic lyrics contradicting its infectious tune.
That’s why “Nobody” is so ingenious and refreshing. Loneliness is a complex emotion, an inevitability far more vicious than most people take it for. And Mitski manages to capture all of its dimensions with her lyricism, using sparse imagery that’s both straightforward (“My God, I'm so lonely / So I open the window / To hear sounds of people”) and whimsical, traversing the universe to showcase the all-consuming expansiveness of loneliness and its crushing power (“Venus, planet of love / Was destroyed by global warming / Did its people want too much too?”).
Unfortunately, the solution isn’t as easy as simply adding people to your life. In the music video, Mitski can’t find anyone, dancing around cardboard cutouts of people with scratched-out faces and walking through a suburb lush with colors, trees, and cars—but no other human beings. In the song, Mitski addresses this concern a little more plainly by both rejecting and longing for a narrative trope: “And I know no one will save me / I just need someone to kiss / Give me one good honest kiss / And I'll be alright.”
So can Mitski be saved, and does she even want to be? Mitski changes her mind just a minute later, asking for “one good movie kiss” instead, a subtle shift that recognizes how human company can be both artificial and inadequate, a quick band-aid fix to a rather stubborn problem. Before that, in the music video, she happily sings “nobody” about a dozen or so times into a hairbrush, clearly having a good time. Then later, she starts scream-singing the word, blurring the line between the previous happy-go-lucky mood and a new, intense urgency that eventually succumbs to the music, Mitski’s voice fading to the background of the song.
There’s the quiet desolation at the end, when Mitski’s voice is muffled by static and the music comes to a hollow close. This is the aftermath of dancing alone in your room, when all the fun and games are done. That’s the complicated thing about loneliness—it’s perpetually multifaceted. It’s a blessing, it’s a curse, it’s liberating, it’s addicting, it aches, it inspires, and sometimes, it’s incurable by everyone else but yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will continue to consider the race of applicants in its admissions process, despite the Trump administration’s Tuesday withdrawal of Obama-era recommendations encouraging affirmative action, University officials said.
“Harvard will continue to vigorously defend its right, and that of all colleges and universities, to consider race as one factor among many in college admissions, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court for more than 40 years,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.
U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education officials jointly penned a “Dear Colleague” letter, which notified universities of the policy change Tuesday. The letter expresses doubts about the legality of race-conscious admissions policies at universities and high schools, and announces the departments’ withdrawal of guidelines for such policies.
“The Departments have reviewed the documents and have concluded that they advocate policy preferences and positions beyond the requirements of the Constitution, Title IV, and Title VI [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964],” the letter reads.
Department of Education representatives suggested the Obama-era recommendations were unnecessary, since the Supreme Court has already issued rulings on the subject.
“The Supreme Court has determined what affirmative action policies are Constitutional, and the Court’s written decisions are the best guide for navigating this complex issue” U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos wrote in a statement provided by spokesperson Elizabeth Hill. “Schools should continue to offer equal opportunities for all students while abiding by the law.”
Harvard argues its affirmative action policies are constitutional and conform to previous Supreme Court rulings.
“Harvard’s approach to race-conscious admissions has been upheld by the Supreme Court for more than 40 years, first in Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke, again in Grutter, and most recently in Fisher II,” Jackson wrote in an additional emailed statement, referring to several affirmative action cases.
A Department of Justice spokesperson was not available for comment.
Harvard is embroiled in a lawsuit alleging discrimination against Asian Americans in its admissions process, which is expected to go to trial in Oct. 2018. The Department of Justice has taken an interest in that case; in April, the department submitted a brief in support of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
The department also launched its own probe into Harvard’s admissions practices, threatening legal action last November against Harvard administrators if they did not hand over admissions documents.
Though some experts called the policy change Tuesday a political move, others believe it unlikely to have any substantial effects on the lawsuit.
In comments to the New York Times, former Justice Department civil rights division official Anurima Bhargava ’96, said the Trump administration timed the policy change to coincide with a late July deadline for certain filings in the Harvard suit.
“This is a wholly political attack,” Bhargava said.
But University of California, Berkeley Law Professor David B. Oppenheimer said the move would not likely sway the outcome of the suit.
“The reason is that this is a policy change which is not influenced by any change in the law,” he said. “Here, there was no change in terms of the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court.”
Andrew Bradt ’02, another law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the move is unlikely to have any impact on the suit at this point.
“I wouldn't think it would have much effect on the current lawsuit, at least until the appellate stage,” Bradt wrote in an emailed statement.
The Trump administration’s letter notes this also, saying “This guidance does not add requirements to applicable law.”
Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity and a former high-level Justice Department official, wrote that he believes the announcement may signal future Trump administration involvement in the lawsuit.
“I think it indicates a rejection of the Obama administration’s defense of racial preferences and, thus, is more evidence that eventually the administration will oppose Harvard in its litigation,” Clegg wrote.
Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, wrote that his organization “welcomes any governmental actions that will eliminate racial classifications and preferences in college admissions.”
This development in the debate over affirmative action is the first to be faced by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who took office Sunday. Bacow defended the College’s admissions policies and rejected allegations of discrimination in an interview with WBUR radio Sunday.
“There have been hundreds of thousands of documents that have been pored through at this point,” Bacow said. “There is not a single one which suggests that there is a policy to discriminate against anybody or to hold one group to a different standard than anybody else.”

After seven years serving as a member of the Harvard Corporation, Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 stepped down from his position last week.
O’Donnell’s time on the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—was marked by his work developing the new Allston campus and role as a leading fundraiser for Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign. The campaign, which has raised more than $9.1 billion, concluded last week.
Before serving on the Corporation, O’Donnell was a member of the Allston Work Team and the Harvard College Fund Executive Committee, as well as an elected director of the Harvard Alumni Association.
At the College, he was a varsity athlete in football and baseball, acting as the captain of the baseball team senior year. After graduating, he worked at the University as the Associate Dean of Students at the Business School.
O’Donnell has also long been a prominent donor. In 2012, he and his wife Katherine A. O’Donnell donated $30 million to the University, and in 1995, he gave $2.5 million to create an endowed chair for Harvard’s baseball coach
Former University president Drew G. Faust wrote in an emailed statement that O’Donnell is a “devoted” and “inspiring” alum.
“He’s always there when you need him, and he’s one of a kind,” Faust wrote. “Joe has been a terrific member of the Corporation, and I have no doubt he’ll remain an energizing force in the life of the University for years to come. We can’t thank him enough.”
University president Lawrence S. Bacow, who took office Sunday, wrote in an emailed statement that O’Donnell’s work on the development of Harvard’s Allston campus was “invaluable.”
“Joe has been a wonderfully thoughtful, dedicated, and generous alum,” Bacow wrote. “And while he may be stepping down from the Corporation, I intend to keep him on speed dial during my time as president.”
Scott A. Abell ’72, former President of the Harvard Board of Overseers, wrote in an email that O’Donnell is “smart,” “tough,” and “loyal.” Abell referred to O’Donnell “one of Harvard’s great treasures.”
“Joe is very well connected, and highly respected, at the local, state and federal level,” Abell wrote. “He constantly seeks ways for Harvard, Cambridge, Boston and the region to work together for everyone’s benefit.”
Abell called O’Donnell “a great legend” at Harvard.
“Joe O’Donnell is irreplaceable,” Abell wrote. “Harvard University could have no greater friend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Drew G. Faust has joined the board of directors of Goldman Sachs, the company announced in a press release Thursday.
The move comes less than a week after Faust ended her 11-year tenure at the helm of the nation’s oldest university. Her appointment to Goldman Sachs’s board as an independent director will expand the group from 11 to 12 members.
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75 praised Faust for leading Harvard through “a decade of growth and transformation” during her presidency in an emailed statement Thursday.
“Her perspective and experience running one of the most complex and preeminent institutions in the world will benefit our board, our firm and our shareholders,” Blankfein wrote.
Faust will become a member of the firm’s governance, public responsibilities, and risk committees.
Her new position likely comes with significant financial perks. Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Ida Hoghooghi wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that Faust will receive an annual grant of restricted stock units valued at $500,000, though the shares underlying the units are not given to directors until after retirement from the board. Directors also earn an annual retainer of $75,000, which they can choose to receive either in cash or in stock units, according to Hoghooghi.
“I mean, is that really what you’re going to focus on?” Blankfein asked in a phone call Thursday, referring to Faust’s salary.
He then mentioned he thinks it is more important to consider why Faust chose to join the firm. He said Harvard and Goldman Sachs have long had a symbiotic relationship in which “a lot” of students from the school “spend years” at the firm after graduating.
Goldman Sachs is not Faust’s first corporate board. She has served on the board of Staples, Inc. since April 2012. 
Outside of the corporate sphere, Faust also serves on the educational advisory board of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation and has served as a member of several academic organizations.
Faust will continue to teach as a professor of History at Harvard. In previous interviews with The Crimson, she refused to specifically detail her post-presidency plans, noting she wanted to spend at least 12 months in her house at Cape Cod reacquainting herself with historical literature.
“I really would like to take the year to think through whether I can be a historian again, what writing project I might want to take on, how I see my voice,” Faust said when asked about her post-presidency life in May 2017. “That’s the non-plan. I’ve wanted to have enough of a plan so that I don’t feel completely useless, but not so much a plan as to restrict my ability to take a deep breath.”
