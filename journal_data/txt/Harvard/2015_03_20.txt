After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2015, at 6:23 p.m.
“McNabb! To Pinkston! The thirty, the twenty, the ten, he’s got nothing but grass ahead of him!”
The shouts rang out, loud and animated. Six-year old Emily B. Zauzmer '18 turned over in bed, wondering how the Eagles could be playing this early on a Saturday morning. It wasn’t noon yet, and by the sounds reverberating through her house, Philadelphia was deep in the fourth quarter.
Stumbling downstairs, she found her brother, Ben T. Zauzmer '15, in front of his computer—the blinking lights of Madden capturing his complete attention. It wasn’t your typical eight-year-old at the controls, however. Ben was indifferent about winning, focused on the game itself. Volume turned off, he’d taken the role of his hero—play-by-play man Merrill Reese—calling the game for both sides.
Sister Julie M. Zauzmer '13 had caught Ben at the trick months earlier, sneaking up on her little brother as he announced his NHL games before school. Julie, a former Crimson managing editor, gave Ben his first profile; before little brother was written about in the Boston Globe and the Daily Mail, he found his way into her fifth-grade writing assignment.
Years later, Ben joined WHRB 95.3 FM, the Harvard student radio station. Over the next four years, he took over play-calling responsibilities for football and basketball, calling games at Fenway Park and TD Garden. His tone became the voice of Crimson sports; the man who self-describes his second religion as “Harvard sports” became its radio prophet.
Yet, as friends and family testify, Zauzmer’s career in broadcasting is about more than becoming the voice of Harvard basketball. Those close to him talk of an inspiring mentor, a transformative leader, and an artisan of his craft—a savant modifying the technology of the future to bring his listeners the quintessential experience of the past.
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
Ben has a hundred stories about his broadcasting career. Name the biggest sports moments in recent Harvard history, and it has been his voice on the air covering them. Princeton’s four touchdowns in 13 minutes to beat Harvard? Check. Upsets of New Mexico and Cincinnati in the NCAA Tournament? Check. The Game? Check.
His favorite story, however, deals with a Crimson loss. The game was two years ago in Princeton, with the Harvard men’s basketball team looking to break a quarter-century of futility at Jadwin Gymnasium. The defending league champion and a victor at home over the Tigers that season, Harvard came in as the favorite. It led almost end to end, but faltered late as a raucous crowd egged the Tigers on to a conference-changing win.
“After the win, the players run to where I am and the students run from behind—at some point in the celebration I get knocked down and fall to the floor,” he recalled. “I try to get up and see this sea of orange-painted legs…. At this point, I am broadcasting into a cellphone and so I crawl under the table and I am screaming into the phone, no idea if anyone is listening. I am doing the full five to 10 minute postgame show solo as they rampage around me.”
He stops and smiled: “It’s a great moment of ‘the show must go on’ attitude in broadcasting.”
His dedication to the craft is the first thing his co-hosts reference. Tessa A.C. Wiegand '15, Ben’s counterpart on the broadcasts for the Yale playoff game and the NCAA Tournament contest tonight, says she thought he was joking when he began to reference facts about the grandparents of the Yale players. He wasn’t.
“I don’t think I know anyone who puts as much effort into something like this, which is not something he plans to do next year,” Wiegand said. “This is not his career plan, this is something he does for fun, and he is so passionate and so dedicated.”
Former co-host Zack W. Guzman ’14 said Ben was the only person he knew to go through the pregame media packets cover to cover. The preparation is key to Ben, who said that during the quickly-moving action of basketball games, you have no time to look down at a roster—it has to be memorized.
A man his co-hosts call a “walking almanac” for Harvard sports, Ben throws out references to players from the early 1950s offhand. His eyes twinkle when I ask what’s the fact about Harvard sports that nobody knows.
Like a man remiss to share state secrets, he wants to keep his facts for the broadcast, but lets slip one golden nugget—that Harvard’s Thursday night contest against North Carolina matches the oldest private university in the country with the oldest public one.
“He appreciates Harvard sports, which is such a uniquely-rich, historical thing,” Julie said. “You don’t have to be the best sports team to have the best history, and he gets that.”
Beyond his encyclopedic knowledge of the game, his peers said that he does what all good broadcasters do—puts his audience at ease.
“The thing that makes radio broadcasters good is when they are friendly and relatable,” said WHRB hockey co-host Savanna M. Arral '16. “Ben has that kind of persona. He’s easy to listen to and makes you feel as though you are a part of the team.”
“It’s very enjoyable to listen [to him] because you feel that he is sharing everything he knows with you,” said roommate John A. Elzinga '15, a former Crimson blog exec. “He is both excited and knowledgeable in a way not a lot of people are.”
BUILDING FROM THE ROOTS
It is that same attitude, Arral said, which makes Ben an excellent leader for WHRB, where he works as head of the sports department. Since he took over, the department has more than tripled in size. Arral and Wiegand both credit him as being the reason they joined, the latter recalling a late night men’s basketball conversation with him about co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi as the reason she signed up.
“The personality that he has [on air] is the same that makes him a good leader,” Arral said. “Everyone feels like they can be a part of something inclusive and something happy.”
“He has done a great job making people know that it exists…bringing in people who are passionate and aren’t saying “I am here to cover hockey” but “I love sports and would like to cover everything”,” Wiegand added. “There’s such a sense of growth and new life.”
Austin B. Harcarik '18, a beneficiary of Ben’s policy that freshmen be able to call football and basketball games—that everyone be treated equally—said that the department head has been a big brother personality for the department.
“There is not one other person or program on campus that has made me feel more welcome than Ben Zauzmer and WHRB Sports,” Harcarik said. “You can really feel lost when you enter Harvard as a freshman, but Ben has always made me feel like I’m part of something great.”
Harcarik and Arral both mentioned the technological improvements Ben has made as one of his key contributions. By doing what he humbly describes as “a lot of Googling and twisting dials,” he created the station’s first online-only broadcasts, creating airtime from, well, thin air. The station, which at one point could not cover games and play music at the same time, had its first three-sport simultaneous broadcast earlier in the year. That night, Zauzmer played producer, walking the listeners through the rotating feeds from women’s basketball, men’s basketball, and men’s ice hockey.
“Ben is the most knowledgeable member of WHRB sports,” Zack W. Royle '17 said. “He has backup plans for his backup plans, and whenever there is any issue with tech, he always knows what to do.”
Julie, the ever-proud older sister, remembers both sides of Ben. As a freshman, the little brother often let his upperclassman sister stay on his couch in Weld, taking care of her when she needed it. As for the intellect, Julie calls Ben “the smartest person I know.”
“He picks up anything and everything with ridiculous ease,” she said. “I remember coming home one day and he told me that he learned how to play the harmonica. I thought he’d play ‘Twinkle, Twinkle,’ and he started playing ‘Piano Man’ [instead].”
SIGNING OFF
Barring a miracle, Ben’s radio career will end this weekend at the NCAA Tournament. Harvard, the winner of one Big Dance game each of the last two years, has never advanced to the Sweet Sixteen and is a massive underdog in its second-round matchup against the Tar Heels.
For Ben, a lifelong March Madness fan, there is no place he’d rather go out.
“I love the Tournament for what it is, the greatest tournament in sports,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything that competes with the excitement of that first weekend. There is no greater adrenaline rush than when you go live on air and you know you are live for 2.5 hours and it’s your job to communicate the excitement I’ve always felt.”
Of course, the Tournament is the site of his most famous call. In Harvard’s third-round game against Michigan State last spring, CBS cut away from its main feed out of a timeout—switching to WHRB’s. The moment was poetic in its symbolism: the entire country getting to enjoy what his sisters had found 15 years earlier—Ben belting the play-by-play without knowing they were there.
Ben laughed at the memory, remembering how his phone blew up because “everyone I’d ever met was apparently watching the game.” A year later, he’s proud of the call.
“I think the call itself was over the top for television, but I thought it was good for radio,” he said. “I was happy with it because it was over the top for an over-the-top moment.”
The unabashed Crimson fan won’t tell who he has in the Harvard game this year, a sly grin playing at the corners of his mouth as he admits how much he wants to win the pool he runs every year, which is now up to 91 participants. He won in eighth grade and has come up empty handed ever since.
In an hour of speaking with me, the other thing he won’t talk about is his final sign-off. He maintains that broadcasts are about the participants, saying “it would be quite selfish to steal that spotlight that I get to control.”
His sisters have another theory. Julie harkens back to Harvard’s final regular-season game against Brown. With a win, the Crimson put itself in a position to make an end-of-season playoff against Yale—so long as the Bulldogs fell in Dartmouth that same night. Harvard ended an hour before Yale, so Julie (who was in town visiting), Ben, and his friends headed to Shake Shack.
“I have never been so riveted by a game that I couldn’t see or hear,” she said. “Ben was doing his radio thing and calling the game based only on the ESPN app. There was a circle of us so glued that we couldn’t order our burgers.”
When Dartmouth won—coming back from five points with 35 seconds to go—Ben dropped the phone, running out into the night screaming, knowing that he had one more game left. When Harvard beat Yale the week after, the senior got to put off his final call one more time.
As Ben prepares for his final call a third time, Emily, now a freshman at Harvard and a Crimson FM writer, says that the final sign-off—the end of his era—weighs more heavily on his mind than he’d care to admit.
“He takes so much pride in WHRB and his work as an announcer,” Emily said. “He has been very hesitant to give his last sign-off on all the recent games.”
“He just keeps hoping there is one more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team (14-7, 5-1 CWPA) trekked to sunny California to take on some of the nation’s best in its annual spring break trip. Adjusting to outdoor play proved to be a smooth transition as the Crimson claimed three wins out of five games in just four days of play.
Harvard opened up play on Sunday with a 14-4 victory against Sonoma St. (6-13). Monday brought a new challenge, as the Crimson defeated Fresno Pacific (5-14) by score of 13-5 and fell to No. 11 UC Davis (12-9), 11-10, in double overtime later in the day. Harvard followed with an 11-8 loss to No. 15 University of the Pacific (7-7) and a 15-8 victory over Cal State East Bay (6-12) before earning a day off on Thursday.
“We’ve talked all year about how this season is a staircase, and we want to be climbing that staircase each day to keep getting better,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “In years past, this stretch would’ve been a tall order for us. I think we’ve really turned the corner as a team.”
HARVARD 15, CAL STATE EAST BAY 8
The Harvard women’s water polo team scored nine goals in the first half against Cal State East Bay and tallied six more in the second as the Crimson defeated the Pioneers by score of 15-8.
Junior attacker Yoshi Andersen scored three consecutive goals late in the third period and in the final frame, chalking up four goals for the day. Junior attacker Charlotte Hendrix and sophomore attacker Michelle Martinelli each added a goal in the middle of the fourth period to cap off a 5-0 Crimson run.
Freshman goalkeeper Cleo Harrington totaled 10 saves to keep the Pioneer offense at bay. Hendrix and sophomore attacker Alexis Del Toro led the squad with four assists each.
UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC 11, HARVARD 8
An early defensive battle, which included 14 saves from senior goalkeeper Ariel Dukes, turned into a shootout late in the game, as the Crimson allowed seven goals in the second half of play.
In the fourth period, the Tigers ran away with what had been a close match until then. With a 7-6 lead heading into the fourth frame, Pacific netted four goals in the quarter, while Harvard failed to keep up the pace. Captain Victoria Frager and Hendrix each scored one goal in the final period.
Harvard came out strong early on, scoring the first two goals of the game, only to give up four straight before halftime. Frager tallied a goal in the third period to tie the game at 6-6, but Pacific outscored the Crimson 5-2 the rest of the way to hold onto the victory.
UC DAVIS 11, HARVARD 10
Del Toro tied the game 10-10 for the Crimson in the second overtime period with her second goal of the game, only to have UC Davis reclaim the lead and hold onto the victory, scoring with only 44 seconds left to play in extra time.
With four minutes left in the third period, Harvard trailed by five, only managing to put three goals past the Aggies until that point. The Crimson stormed back and only allowed one goal in the period following a timeout, while providing three of its own, including two from sophomore 2-meter Melissa Balding and one from Hendrix before the end of the period.
With an upset in the making, it was freshman goalkeeper Cleo Harrington who saved four shots, which was enough to shut out the Aggies in the final frame. Frager kicked off the scoring 35 seconds into the fourth period, and a UC Davis ejection sparked a goal from Grabb to pull within one. It was Del Toro who tied the game with four minutes remaining, and the score remained deadlocked at nine until the end of regulation.
“When it was 8-3 in the third, [coach Minnis] told us to just keep chipping away,” Hendrix said. “We got ourselves in the mindset that we needed to play solid offense and solid defense, and we went from there.”
HARVARD 13, FRESNO PACIFIC 5
For the second game in a row, Balding led the scoring charge for Harvard, and for the second game in a row, the sophomore notched four goals, including three in the first half. While the Sunbirds fought back, the Crimson proved too offensively efficient, and the offense erupted again for 13 goals in the game.
In the second period, Harvard outscored its opponent 4-1, stretching the lead to five by halftime. Hendrix and Andersen each tallied two goals in the second period.
Junior attacker Rachel Lobato added two goals for the Crimson, as the team carried its halftime momentum through the remainder of the game. Two more goals from Harvard put the game out of reach for Fresno Pacific, as the Crimson extended its west coast win streak to two.
HARVARD 14, SONOMA ST. 4
California native Melissa Balding made an immediate impact for the Crimson during her homecoming, tallying four goals on the day including three in the first half.
The Seawolves chalked up three goals in the second period, but the Crimson offense proved overwhelming as it carried an 8-3 lead into halftime. Frager added two goals, and Hendrix picked up two of her own to push the Harvard lead to 10 by the start of the fourth period.
The final period provided a defensive struggle from both teams, as Harvard freshman attacker Sami Strutner scored the frame’s lone goal.
“This team is very hungry,” Minnis said. “They want to give themselves the best opportunity to make it to the NCAA Championship. These are games that help us learn to play at a high level.”
Harvard continues its California road trip this Saturday at No. 2 and defending national champion, Stanford.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard's NCAA Frozen Four semifinal matchup against crosstown foe Boston College less than a day away, The Back Page presents some of the key quotes from Thursday afternoon's press conference in Minneapolis.
From Harvard coach Katey Stone’s opening statement:
“We are certainly very pleased to be here. We haven’t played in Minnesota during this time of year in a handful of years so it is nice to be back.”
The Back Page: This is the Crimson’s first NCAA Frozen Four appearance since 2008, and sixth in program history. In that 2008 season, Harvard beat Dartmouth in the first round, 5-1, before falling to Wisconsin by a 4-1 score in the semis. Since then, the Crimson qualified for the NCAA Tournament in 2010 and 2013, but dropped first round games against Cornell and who else but Boston College, respectively.
Stone, on if the last two games against BC will affect Harvard emotionally:
“I can only speak on our kids and it is just another hockey game on the road toward our ultimate goal. It doesn’t matter whether we are playing BC or Minnesota or Wisconsin.”
TBP: Arguably, the 10-2 embarrassment at the hands of the Eagles was a season-defining turning point for the Crimson. Coming into that game, Harvard had gone 0-1-2 and had squandered quality chances to net the game winner in both ties. But following the blowout loss to the Eagles, Harvard rattled off 10 straight wins. And since the Crimson’s Beanpot final win over BC, the Queens of Boston have gone 7-1-1.

Stone, on having Olympians on a team with players who have no Frozen Four experience… 
“I certainly hope it is a good thing that they have had a lot of big game experience but all of our kids have had those experiences in different ways. They have played for state championships, New England Prep School championships, and U-18 National Team experience. Players coming into all of our programs are pretty seasoned and they are winners. They are going to go out there and hopefully be able to manage the pressure, assert the pressure and hopefully be able to enjoy themselves.”
TBP: Many of these players will walk onto the ice having played each other long before college hockey. As noted by Crimson writer Sam Danello, between the two rosters, 13 players competed in New England’s Independent School League.
Harvard senior forward Samantha Reber, on playing on a team with a deep, productive roster… 
“I think it’s something really special that we have. We have a lot of depth, starting with our goalies, through our defense and all the way up to our forwards. I think it makes everyone a little more comfortable knowing that any line, any defensive pairing or any goalie in net is going to play unbelievably well…. Our freshmen aren’t playing like freshmen, and they go out there like they’ve been here for years, which makes everyone really fun to play with.”
TBP: Often overlooked because of the strong play of junior forwards Mary Parker and Miye D’Oench and senior forward Samantha Reber, freshman forwards Lexie Liang and Karly Heffernan have given the Crimson a boost in some key moments this year. Liang had two assists in Harvard’s NCAA quarterfinal win over Quinnipiac, and Heffernan has scored and recorded an assist in Crimson’s last two games. Performances like these hint at Harvard offense that, combined with the output of sophomore forward Sydney Daniels, is stocked for the next few years.
Stone, on BC’s struggles with repeat opponents… 
“I didn’t know anything about that and honestly, we have struggled a couple of times with teams we’ve played before too. At the end of day when the puck drops you just have to find a way to win.
BC Coach Katie Crowley, on playing Harvard in the semifinal instead of a WCHA team…
“Our team is more comfortable playing a team like Harvard when you’ve played them twice and know their style of play. I think you could say that we are more comfortable with that but if it is better or worse… I don’t know?”
TBP: It’s hard to find fault in this 34-2-2 Eagles team that didn’t lose a single game from the end of September until the Feb. 10 Beanpot. However, BC has been troubled by Boston teams, first with the Crimson, and then with the Eagles’ 4-1 loss to Boston University in BC’s second-straight loss to the Terriers in the conference finals. Despite Alex Carpenter’s 35th goal of the season, it was the Eagle’s defense that faltered in the third period, as goalie Katie Burt conceded three of the eight shots that came her way. Friday night’s game will almost certainly put both coaches’ statements to the test.
Crowley, On the Eagles’ outlook on the game after the Beanpot championship game…
“I think we have a really good rivalry with Harvard regardless of who won the last game…. Even in the first game we played with them it was a heated game…. I think it is great for women’s hockey to have that rivalry and I think it will be another exciting game on Friday night.”
TBP: Historically, the Crimson’s 37-15-1 record against BC suggests a lopsided rivalry at best. However, in the past five years, Harvard has struggled to score against the Eagles—the 3-2 Beanpot victory was the first time the Crimson had found the back of the net more than two times against BC since the 2009-2010 season. In fact, Harvard has gone 1-6-1 against the Eagles in the past five years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 19, 2015, 10:24 p.m.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—With 1:20 left in the game and his Harvard men’s basketball team trailing by two, Siyani Chambers truly typified the ‘madness’ so inherent to the NCAA Tournament. Chambers held the ball behind the three-point line, waiting for senior wing Wesley Saunders to shake his Tar Heel defender and get open. With the clock ticking down to single digits, Chambers had no choice but to make a play himself. He dribbled to the top of the key and pulled up, a foot behind the line.
The shot was in the air as Chambers fell to the floor, and it sliced through the net as the referee’s whistle blew. Moments later, Chambers had sunk the free throw, completing the four-point play and giving the Crimson (22-8, 11-3 Ivy) its first lead of the evening. What was a 16-point deficit was now a two-point advantage—and Harvard was only 1:15 away from advancing to the round of 32.
But a runner near the left elbow from North Carolina freshman Justin Jackson, followed by the rookie’s transition slam 25 seconds later gave the advantage, and the game, back to the favorites. As a desperation three-pointer from Saunders with one second left ricocheted off the rim, the score went final. Despite a game-high 26 points from Saunders, his Crimson fell, 67-65, to the No. 4-seeded Tar Heels (25-11, 11-7 ACC) Thursday evening in its second-round matchup at Veterans Memorial Arena.
“[I] can’t say enough about the effort that our kids put forth, the battle to get back in it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we played with great poise and…[Saunders and Chambers] carried us to put us in a position to have a chance. I'm very proud of our team.”
Harvard’s comeback effort began at the 14:16 mark of the second period when, down 52-36, senior forward Jonah Travis hit a pair of free throws. North Carolina wouldn’t score for almost four minutes—until just 11:27 remained—giving the Crimson time to inch back into the contest.
After a Tar Heel turnover on the next play, Saunders skipped a pass to sophomore Corbin Miller in the left corner. The marksman hit his first triple of the game just moments before senior forward Jonah Travis drew a charge on the other end. Harvard would go on to score 14 points in the next 5:40 of play, holding North Carolina to six in the same span.
And when Chambers found Saunders in the left short corner with just three on the shot clock plays later—and Saunders promptly sunk the jumper to bring the Crimson within two—all was set up for Chambers’s straightaway, last-second triple on Harvard’s next possession, with the Crimson playing Cinderella once more, now up two with 1:15 to go.
“Coach just told us to keep fighting, eventually our shots would go down,” Chambers explained. “When Corbin hit [his three], it really gave us a shot in the arm…. It got us on a nice run that we kept riding until the end.”
But the Crimson’s lead was short-lived. When the Tar Heels brought the ball down the floor after Chambers’s four-point play, junior J.P. Tokoto sent it to Jackson on the left wing. Jackson connected on a shot from about 15 feet out, tying the game at 65 apiece.
From there, North Carolina’s defensive pressure stifled the Crimson. Chambers was forced to put up a contested three-pointer with the clock running down, before Tokoto grabbed the board and sent it ahead to point guard Marcus Paige. Paige found Jackson on the left block, who slammed the ball into the hoop before Harvard could get back.
Then, with just 11 seconds remaining, a missed shot from Chambers led to an over-the-back foul called on Travis. The Tar Heels missed the front end of its one-and-one, however, and Harvard grabbed the rebound.
After climbing all the way back into the contest, Harvard now had just about 10 seconds to fight its way back once more. At the end of a broken play, Saunders heaved up that deep, ricocheting three just before moments before the final horn sounded, seemingly the first shot all game that the senior could not get to fall.
“[T]he play was actually set up for Corbin to get the ball…[but] they were kind of cheating towards him,” Saunders said. “So I realized the clock was running down so I had to get up a shot. It felt kind of good, and it just went off the backboard, and it was just demoralizing.”
The skeleton of Thursday’s game—Harvard’s 16-point comeback, two-point advantage, and eventual loss—was a mirror image of the heartbreak that the Crimson suffered in the third round of last year’s March Madness, a game in which it fought back from an equal deficit—and gained that same lead—against eventual game-winner Michigan State.
“I feel like I've won the lottery because Tommy Amaker did a much better job with his team than I did with mine,” said Tar Heels coach Roy Williams. “We were extremely lucky. It's the luckiest I've ever felt after a basketball game in my entire life.”
Saunders was visibly moved when he took the podium after the contest. In the last game of his collegiate career, the former Ivy League Player of the Year reached the 1500-point plateau and nearly willed Harvard to victory with his 26-point, 8-of-14 from-the-field performance. It was he who provided the offense in the early going when no other Crimson could connect—scoring or assisting on every basket in the first half—and it was he who found ways to score, despite a swarming defense, in the game’s waning minutes.
“Wesley is an outstanding basketball player,” Amaker said. “As I’ve said before, it’s not always the points he scores, it’s the points he’s responsible for…and he was responsible for a heck of a lot of production for our team this evening.”
For this group of seniors, Jackson’s dunk with moments remaining ended a four-year era that saw unprecedented growth and success for the Crimson. The seniors made the Tournament each season, gaining national media attention and dancing with the best, year after year, in March Madness
So while the players spoke of the pain of the loss immediately following the game, Thursday’s fight against North Carolina was also indicative of the place to which this senior class has brought Harvard hoops. Not only did the Crimson come back against one of the most storied schools in collegiate basketball, but not many were surprised when it did so, basket by basket slicing into the Tar Heels’ lead. For these seniors, then, it was only appropriate to end their time on the collegiate hardwood in such a fashion—in a game that showcased just how far the Harvard basketball program has come.
“It’s been a roller coaster kind of journey, but I think one thing we learned about this team is that we are fighters,” Moundou-Missi said. “No matter how tough the situation is, we can figure out a way to somehow get out of it. But I think…our entire team did a great job [tonight]—the outcome was unfortunate for us, but I’m really proud of those guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to play-by-play data compiled by The Crimson’s Data Science Team, the most valuable player Harvard is not former Ivy League Player of the Year senior wing Wesley Saunders, but co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi—the league’s Defensive Player of the Year.
Harvard scored at a sizzling rate of 111.7 points per 100 possessions when Moundou-Missi was on the floor, which dropped to just 103.6 when he sat. The biggest change, however, was on the defensive end. Harvard gave up just 92.5 points per 100 possessions when Moundou-Missi played, the best of any Crimson regular, and gave up 106.2 when he sat. Without its co-captain, the Crimson was actually outscored by eight points, something that did not happen with any other rotation player on the bench.
The senior’s impact could be seen in the team’s field goal shooting percentage as well, which went up 4.5 percent with him on the floor. Junior co-captain and point guard Siyani Chambers proved similarly valuable, with the team shooting nearly seven percent better from two-point range with him on the floor and turning the ball over nearly 20 percent less.
Two of the Crimson’s starters—junior Agunwa Okolie and sophomore Zena Edosomwan—fared worse by the metrics. Both were ranked among the 10 worst starters in the tournament by ESPN before March Madness began and the team was better in both cases without them on the floor. In the case of Okolie, although the team was nearly five points per 100 possessions better with him (and not backup sophomore Corbin Miller) on the floor, it was 6.3 points worse on offense. The Crimson turned the ball over less with the steady defensive specialist on the floor, but shot five percent worse from inside the arc.
Indeed, the Crimson was better when it played the combination of Saunders, Chambers, and Miller rather than the lineup featuring than Saunders, Chambers, and Okolie. Opponents shot nearly three percent better against the latter combination, rebounding more of their misses, but Harvard turned the ball over less and shot better from the field itself.
Methodology:
This week, The Crimson took play-by-play data from 28 of the team’s 29 games and aggregated it to find statistics for each lineup that has taken the floor this season. By calculating the marginal distributions of points per possession, The Crimson generated offensive and defensive efficiency numbers, measured—as is standard—by points scored and allowed per 100 possessions. Harvard plays roughly 64 possessions a game and, in general, outscores opponents by 10 points per 100 possessions—analogous to its seven points per game.
The data above reflects net efficiency numbers for individual players, taken by subtracting the number of points scored per 100 possessions from those scored on Harvard. Numbers were not adjusted for quality of its opponents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ridder Arena, the site of the 2015 women’s NCAA Frozen Four, is not a building accustomed to silence.
Over the last 10 years, the Minneapolis stadium has hosted three Frozen Fours and eight WCHA conference championships. Screaming crowds are as much a part of the architecture as the maroon-colored bleachers or the four-sided jumbo screen that hangs above center ice.
But on Thursday afternoon, when Harvard skaters took the ice for a tune-up in preparation for Friday’s national semifinal against Boston College, Ridder was an empty and desolate space. Whistles echoed; pucks echoed.
The quietness was really just a form of anticipation, a reminder of the chaos that glooms over the not-so-distant future. Tomorrow night, the Crimson will encounter either exhaustion or exhilaration, and the encounter will not take place in silence.
“It’s definitely a source of energy,” junior defender Michelle Picard said. “But within the rink, it’s the same game. We know what we’re here to do—just take a deep breath and play our game.”
Still, sitting in vacant rows, watching Crimson players joke around on an empty ice rink—it all makes you wonder whether Harvard, or any young team for that matter, can handle the transition from quiet privacy to loud and sudden publicity.
For three Crimson players and one coach, however, this doubt has already been answered. It’s inaccurate to characterize the upcoming tangle with the Eagles as the most significant contest of their careers because that milestone came and went just over a year ago.
On Feb. 20 of last year, the United States National Team suited up for a gold-medal final against Canada, and Harvard’s crimson-and-white was well represented among the red-white-and-blue. Not only did Crimson coach Katey Stone head the American squad, but she was also joined by senior defender Josephine Pucci, Picard, and senior forward Lyndsey Fry.
“I definitely learned a lot,” Picard said. “I got to play some big games on a big stage. This [semifinal] is another big game on another big stage.”
The game ended with heartbreak in the form of a 3-2 overtime loss, but a year removed from the event, Harvard players cite the Winter Olympics as a meaningful source of exposure to high-stakes hockey.
“As far as big games are concerned, you kind of get used to it,” Fry said. “Having that experience takes the nerves away a little bit.”
The setting alone substantiates the claim. In the National Team’s final Olympic match, the squad played beneath the Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, Russia, which seats 12,000; nearly five million other viewers tuned in on NBC. By comparison, the Ridder Arena has capacity for 3,400 fans.
BC is not a stranger to Olympic experience, as junior forward Alex Carpenter made the trip to Sochi as well. At the games, she recorded four goals and an assist, which ranked her as the eighth-highest scorer in the world for the competition.
Eagles coach Katie King Crowley boasts an even more impressive Olympic resume. Crowley holds the all-time Olympic scoring record for the National Team; she compiled this total over three different Games. In all international play, she finished with 265 points.
However, Crowley has not led an Olympic side into battle as a coach. Stone has, which gives her a store of firsthand anecdotes to draw from.
“Fear can be paralyzing,” Stone said. “We’re going to do our best to try to limit distractions so that our kids can be at their best when their best is needed. Certainly, it’s a big stage for all the athletes involved in thus tournament, [and] it should be exciting.”
Of course, the Crimson roster includes more than three players and a coach. There are nearly two dozen skaters without Olympic experience on Harvard, which causes the question of pressure to resurface.
Again, Crimson team members respond by citing past performances. Even if Harvard players have not participated in an international tournament on the scale of the Sochi Olympics, they have played in other serious matches—prep school championships, state championships, age-specific national team games, and the like.
“All of our kids have had those experiences in different ways,” Stone said. “Players coming into all of our programs are pretty seasoned, and they are winners.”
In the 2014-15 campaign alone, the Crimson has played in enough elimination games to give a foretaste of the intensity of the Frozen Four.
In mid-February, Harvard defeated BC for the Beanpot title. Two weeks ago, the Crimson again pulled out an elimination game victory, this one over Cornell, to claim the ECAC championship. In both games, freshman forward Karly Heffernan scored a goal, and other young players contributed key minutes.
“Our freshmen aren’t playing like freshmen,” senior forward Samantha Reber said. “They go out there like they’ve been here for years, which makes everyone really fun to play with.”
Olympic experience or not, playoff experience or not, all past storylines should fall away as soon as Friday’s match gets underway. That’s the beauty of playoff hockey—nothing matters except for the 60 minutes on the ice.
“I’ve never been in the Frozen Four, so I’m just trying to take it one game at a time,” Picard said. “I’m excited to play with this team…. What happened a year ago doesn’t mean anything for tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Clang. Clang. Clang.
With less than a minute to go—the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-8, 11-3 Ivy) saw three chances to take the lead. Thrice the Crimson got a look it would take again, barely contested threes by its two best scorers, senior wing Wesley Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers.
Miss. Miss. Miss.
The result: a heartbreaking 67-65 loss to North Carolina (25-11, 11-7 ACC) in the second round of the NCAA Tournament and an introduction to the darker side of March. After winning second-round games in consecutive years, the Crimson found itself on the other side of the coin: shocked at the podium, avoiding eyes and muttering answers.
“This obviously isn’t the finish that I wanted to have, but we knew it was going to end eventually,” Saunders said.
CONTROLLING THE PACE
The game was billed as a contrast of styles: while Harvard grinded its way through Ivy play, averaging 52.5 points in its two biggest wins over rival Yale, Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said a day ago that he’d rather win in the 80s than in the 50s.
Throughout Thursday’s contest, the diverging game plans were evident. North Carolina ran out after every defensive rebound, generating a fast-break opportunity on its second possession, its last, and many in between. The most crucial came late. Tied at 65, Tar Heel junior J.P. Tokoto pulled down a Chambers miss with 31 seconds remaining and found a streaking Marcus Paige. In a two-on-one against sophomore Corbin Miller, Paige played it perfectly, finding Justin Jackson for a fast break dunk.
“We knew coming into the basketball game how challenging it was going to be with their transition game and then their offensive rebounding,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
For the game, the Crimson largely kept the pace in its favor. While Harvard was outscored on fast break points, 10-2, it committed only seven turnovers—every time the Tar Heels went out and running, it was off a long rebound. The Crimson outscored North Carolina, 29-6, on points off of turnovers, forcing 17 mistakes and keeping itself in the game amidst tough shooting (38.2 percent from the field).
“You’ve gotta give Harvard credit for driving me whacko,” said Tar Heels coach Roy Williams afterwards.
DOING IT ALL
All game, the Crimson turned to Saunders when it couldn’t find offense elsewhere. Saunders was responsible, through point or assist, for 38 of the Crimson’s 65 points on the night. He had the first 10 points for the Crimson and 15 of the 25 in the first half, escaping Tokoto with an array of spin moves and crossovers.
“We thought we had a strategy for him, but it didn’t work,” Williams said. “J.P. really did a pretty doggone good job, but he was really, really hard to guard.”
As large as Saunders’s presence was during the initial stages of the night, it loomed largest at the finish. After Harvard fell down 14 to start the second half, he either assisted on or scored 12 of the next 18 points as Harvard cut the deficit to nine. It was his jumper that cut the lead to two after a Paige three with 3:23 to go appeared to be the dagger.
As the game ended, the Crimson went right back to him. With 40 seconds left and the game tied, he sprinted around a Tar Heel hedge and found Miller in the corner. The Crimson’s second-best three-point shooter passed up the open look, flipping the ball straight to Chambers.
The junior, whose four-point play gave Harvard its first (and only) lead of the night 30 seconds earlier, didn’t hesitate—going straight for the jugular. The ball clanged off the back iron, his shot 17 seconds later doing the same.
After North Carolina center Kennedy Meeks missed a free throw, Harvard put the ball in its star’s hands. Saunders hesitated, chose not to drive, and went for the win. The shot—which afterwards the senior admitted “felt kind of good”—hit the back of the rim.
“We wanted it in Wesley’s hands,” Amaker said. “The way he’s been playing, [the way] he played tonight, he was outstanding. I thought he was as good as anybody that played in our game here this evening.”
MOVING FORWARD
At the postgame podium, the Crimson talked about the end of an era. The seniors—who totaled 41 points and all but eight rebounds—won four Ivy League championships. They were part of the Crimson’s first NCAA Tournament trip since the Ivy League was founded, its first win in that span, and established a new reign of league control. The team lost just nine Ancient Eight games over the last four years, and rescued a title from the jaws of defeat this season.
“I wouldn’t rather go out there and battle with any other group of guys,” Saunders sad. “Everybody is like family. We’ve been through good times, bad times, and, I mean, it’s just been a blessing that I’ve been able to be a part of this.
The game put on display what the Crimson loses—a stable cadre of big men the likes of which it cannot replace. The only non-senior big man to get minutes, sophomore Zena Edosomwan, was largely ineffective aside from a pair of wide-open dunks—dragging down just one rebound in eight minutes.
Seniors Kenyatta Smith and Jonah Travis held their own against North Carolina’s imposing front line, hounding the starting frontcourt Meeks and Jackson into nine combined turnovers and helping Harvard bring down 12 offensive rebounds—the same number as the Tar Heels.
“I’m really proud of the senior class,” Chambers said. “They left a great legacy. I learned so much from them, and I can’t thank them enough.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With ticks to go in the Game 3 rubber match of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals, the Yale men’s ice hockey team held a 2-1 lead, its anaconda-like defense suffocating Harvard’s attack in a seemingly inevitable fashion.
Yale had yet to lose a game in 2014-2015 when leading after two periods. The Crimson, meanwhile, had yet to win a game when trailing after two. The visitors had provided little indication of reversing that trend with a stifled effort out of the intermission.
“This game is over,” Josh Seguin of College Hockey News tweeted from the press box with about four minutes to go. “Harvard has done nothing this period.”
Around then, things began to change—innocently enough at first.
Harvard junior Desmond Bergin saucered a pass to fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell, who pirouetted over the red line. As he cut into the Yale zone, he took out the stick of Bulldog junior Ryan Obuchowski, who skated after it as Crimson forwards crowded the crease and Blackwell moved to his backhand.
Two seconds later, Obuchowski and the 2,500-odd witnesses at Ingalls learned a valuable lesson:
Never, ever count out Patrick McNally.
***
Bergin struggles to contain his amazement.
“From an uneducated point of view—I wasn’t in on all the doctor’s meetings and stuff—but just knowing his injury, it almost seems comical or miraculous that he’d be able to play in so short a time,” Bergin says. “But he kept saying that he was going to be back for the playoffs.”
Bergin is fielding a call about McNally—his partner on the Crimson’s first defensive pair. It’s Tuesday morning, three days before the ECAC tournament semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y., where No. 17/15 Harvard (19-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) will play No. 7/7 Quinnipiac (23-10-4, 16-3-3).
Less than 36 hours earlier, Harvard had eliminated Yale, 3-2, in a double overtime contest—the longest ever in the schools’ 250-game series. With just over three minutes left in regulation, McNally had connected on Blackwell’s backhanded assist to tie the game. Then with just over three minutes left in the second overtime period, McNally provided the shot that led to junior forward Jimmy Vesey’s game-winning strike.
But for all the fourth-year defenseman’s late-game heroics, Bergin is just amazed that McNally was skating next to him.
Near the end of the call, Bergin tries to amend his comments, saying that he doesn’t want McNally to take them the wrong way. Later that evening, McNally reacts to Bergin’s words good-humoredly.
“I’ve never really dealt with an injury like this before, so I would not really have the knowledge to call it ‘miraculous’ or ‘not miraculous,’” McNally says. “I can’t really put a name to what I’m doing.”
***
McNally entered 2015 on a roll. By the turn of the calendar year, the Glen Head, N.Y., native was leading all NCAA Division I defensemen in points per game on a team that ranked first in every objective measure for ranking college teams—from win percentage to PairWise. He received a national nod as a nominee for the Hobey Baker Memorial Award—hockey’s Heisman—on Jan. 9.
But on Jan. 23 in Ithaca, McNally’s—and the Crimson’s—season changed forever. Less than six minutes into Harvard’s rivalry game at Lynah Rink, McNally’s left skate caught the stick of a Cornell forward behind the play near the Harvard goal. McNally vainly tried to support himself on his right leg, which crumpled underneath him.
Later that week, McNally learned that he would miss the remainder of the regular season.
“I will be out for probably the remainder of the season, but there is a chance that I could be back for the [ECAC Hockey] playoffs,” McNally told The Harvard Crimson on Jan. 30.
With McNally sidelined, Harvard’s performance sagged. The Crimson struggled with other injuries, yet no absence was felt greater than McNally’s. The team’s ability to possess the puck and break out of its zone declined dramatically, and Harvard lacked a consistent scoring threat from the point.
Meanwhile, outside observers were not so sure how serious McNally was about the possibility of returning. His injury seemed too severe, and rumors circulated that he had elected for surgery over rehab.
His return on Friday for Game 1 of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals surprised and intrigued the media at Ingalls. Did he come back too soon? Will he be a liability? Is he crazy?
Behind the scenes, Ted Donato ’91 knew that McNally was ready. The 11th-year coach had entrusted his star defenseman to Harvard’s ace team of trainers, which had successfully returned Blackwell to the lineup in peak form just two weeks earlier.
Under the watchful eye of Harvard trainer Chad Krawiec, McNally completed an intensive regimen of therapy that involved three hours per day of legwork. A week and a half before the quarterfinals, McNally returned to non-contact skates. A weekend out, he watched from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center stands as his team played Brown in the first round of the ECAC tournament, confident that his boys would get him to the next round. On Wednesday, McNally participated in his first full-contact practice.
“Our team definitely feeds off his confidence, his character, and his talent,” Donato said in a pre-Lake Placid teleconference Monday. “So getting Pat back, even in a limited health situation, is still a huge bonus to our team.”
In Game 1, McNally quickly dispelled most concerns on the ice. He was a step slow at first on the backcheck and seemed to choose his strides judiciously, yet he grew stronger with each shift. Breaking the puck out of his zone, he had a calming effect on his teammates with his crisp passes and confident puck-handling. And he was unafraid to take risks, driving to the net on multiple occasions.
“I know for me to be effective and for me to have a positive impact out there, I’ve got to kind of play the way I always do,” McNally said on Tuesday. “I just try to...play to my game and just try to help my team out as much as possible.”
***
Delia McNally remembers her first pair of rental skates. She was four years old, and her mother Jean had decided to teach her and her five-year-old brother, Pat, how to skate at the Port Washington Skating Center on Long Island.
“[The clerk] went to go get me the white figure skates ones, but I started screaming that I wanted the same black ones as Pat’s,” Delia says on the phone from the University of Vermont, where she just finished her final season of college hockey as a forward for the Catamounts. “I wanted to do everything that he did.”
That’s the way things worked with the McNally siblings. Pat set the agenda, and Delia followed. They weren’t born with sticks in their hands. Their father Thomas, an FBI agent in New York City, played football at Columbia. Jean, a longtime elementary school teacher, decided to teach her children how to skate because she simply considered it a life skill.
Rather, it was Pat who decided that hockey would be their sport. After each skating lesson with Jean during public ice time, he would beg her to let him and his sister stand behind the glass to watch the local junior team practice. He told his mother that he wanted to be a hockey player.
Pat and Delia would grow up together through the game, playing the same position. Despite their dispositions for offense, their size and reach made them prime defensemen. Only later in her career would Delia move up to offense.
Delia says that she always wanted to be around Pat because of his positivity and inclusiveness. On tough days in grade school, Pat would stop in between her classes to cheer her up. During recess, Pat was the most athletic kid on the playground, but he always made sure that Delia was in the game.
“He never made me feel like I was intruding or just tagging along; he always made me feel like I was part of his friends and one of the guys,” Delia says. “He always had that older brother, protective instinct, and then I think he always treated me as one of his friends too. That’s what really made me want to always be around him.”
Through it all, the two have shared their ups and downs. She was among the first to give him a hug when the Vancouver Canucks selected him in the fourth round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, and she was among the first outside of Ithaca to learn of his injury.
She came back from a pre-game meal to find three texts and a missed call on her phone from her parents, who were at the game. Later, she received a text from Pat, who said that he would try to make one of her games at Boston University that weekend.
Pat ended up not making it. He was in too much pain. When Delia saw a video of Pat’s injury, her heart sank.
“It definitely was hard to see because you can definitely tell his knee locks out,” Delia says.
“And being an athlete myself, that’s always a fear, [injuring your knee]…. My mom said he was screaming on the ice and everything, and I knew half of it was pain and the other half was just…the fear of having that happen.”
Delia was surprised—and a little concerned, at first—when she learned that Pat might be able to come back for the season. Yet she ultimately trusted his judgment. Pat has the tendency, she says, to make the best out of a bad situation.
Early in the 2012-2013 season, McNally and three other players withdrew from the College. While his peers were young enough to play on junior hockey teams during their lost year, McNally had to find another means to stay sharp. He took a job at a construction management firm in Quincy, Mass., and he worked out at a local sports performance center.
Through a difficult year in which local and national media speculated on the nature of his withdrawal, McNally remained his positive self and packed on muscle. When Delia saw Pat for the first time that summer, she noticed that he must have been “working out like crazy.”
“When things happen that would knock normal kids down and make them give up, he just finds the best option from that,” Delia says. “When everything happened with school and stuff, he just found a great job to do; he found a great place to work out. I think that instead of letting it knock him down, he got so much stronger.”
McNally, an academic junior, does not yet know whether he will be eligible to play during his fifth year at Harvard. He will know by the end of this academic year. In the meantime, he’s savoring every shift.
“Right now I’m just enjoying the moment,” McNally says. “Enjoying the fact that we’re in the final four of the ECAC again.”
***
It’s Sunday at Ingalls.
Ten minutes after Vesey’s goal, McNally lumbers over from the visitors’ locker room to speak with the press. Something is off. It’s not the huge bandage on his forehead. Everybody saw McNally’s helmet cut into his forehead after sustaining an illegal hit from behind that sent him into the backboards late in the first overtime period.
No, what is unusual is his attire. Most players dress out of their game equipment before engaging with media. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound McNally is still in his skates and leg pads, towering over the reporters.
Perhaps he is just too caught up in the moment to change. Perhaps he wants to protect his knee from prying eyes.
“Some people were saying you were playing with one leg out there,” a reporter says. “Incredibly effective with one leg.”
“I wouldn’t say one leg,” McNally laughs. “I mean, maybe one a little bit stronger leg….”
The questions continue. Did he ever doubt that he would be able to come back?
“To be honest, I had no idea…. The doctors said at best a certain time, at worst a certain time. There was never really a conclusive date….”
How close was the quarterfinal to that “at best” estimate?
McNally grins and settles on an answer that is both cryptic and matter-of-fact.
“Uhh, this weekend we were playing Yale in the second round. Even if it wasn’t the best time, there was no way I wasn’t going to try and play. So that’s pretty much the answer for that one.”
***
McNally expresses his love for his team in an understated way. Given a similar situation, most elite prospects would likely focus on their long-term health. But for McNally, the decision to come back this season was a natural one.
“He’s always been the kid to put the team first and always wants to play for his team over the individual goals and stuff,” Delia says. “So I knew he was going to do whatever he could to get back in the game as quickly as possible.”
Nothing would mean more to McNally than a team championship. He’s been there once before, captaining Milton Academy (Mass.) to its first and only New England Prep School Championship under coach Paul Cannata.
McNally arrived at Milton from a relatively obscure Long Island club as a fourth-year junior. Nobody at the Massachusetts boarding school knew exactly how good the incoming defenseman would be. He quickly commanded a leading role in his first year and blitzed the prep circuit for the overall scoring title in his second, title-winning season.
“He led the world in points that year,” Cannata laughs over the phone on Wednesday. He recalls that McNally came to Milton with a “strong slant” toward committing to Yale. “Everyday he would come into the rink with that sort of optimistic, upbeat, let’s-go-play-hockey attitude.”
Cannata feels that McNally’s decision to return reflects a special mindset.
“Patrick has a stubborn streak to him that serves him well,” Cannata says. “And in this case, I know that there are some quality people around him who advised him that this was probably not a smart thing to do, and quite frankly, it probably wasn’t.”
That’s not to say that Cannata thinks that McNally shouldn’t have returned.
“If you’re going to do things at a high level, you have to have a different way of thinking,” Cannata says. “Whatever domain you’re in…to be that successful in your particular domain, you have to think differently than 99.99 percent of the rest of the people.”
For Cannata, McNally is part of that 0.01 percent—that rare breed of player who dares to think differently. This weekend, McNally and the Crimson will compete for a conference title at Herb Brooks Arena—the site of the 1980 Miracle On Ice. Whether or not McNally’s return is similarly “miraculous,” his story this last week has read like a Disney movie.
“To come from not playing...to then playing three games in three nights, to then getting the game-tying goal late in the third period and getting the assist on the game-winner in double overtime, it’s almost a script,” Cannata says. “People don’t realize the qualities of these kids who do those things. Let’s just say they don’t grow on trees, my friend.”
