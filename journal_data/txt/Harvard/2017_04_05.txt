After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its depiction of a crumbling utopia, Aldous Huxley’s 1932 classic “Brave New World” poses moral quandaries that remain relevant today. In their adaptation of the novel, the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company has found their own way to make connections between Huxley’s futuristic world and our present one. Staged in the black box of the Loeb Ex from April 6 to 8, the show will immerse the audience in an emotional experience of dance and projection. Each piece in the multi-part show will convey a predominant theme rather than a specific chapter.
Directors Sarah E. Coady ’19 and Gabe S. Martinez ’18 wanted to return to the narrative as an inspiration to the show after the success of their 2015 fall adaptation of Homer’s “Odyssey.” They decided to use Huxley’s book because of its timelessness and relevance. “I think a lot of the themes about an over-powerful state and questions about one’s identity… are very relevant to today’s world,” says Coady.
The show consists of twelve pieces in diverse styles accompanied by a wide range of music, each chosen to encapsulate the eerie, dystopian environment of the novel’s world. In order to maximize space, the dances are not staged within actual sets but instead are framed by hanging sheets composed of many individual threads. During the performances, these moving plans display projections of abstract shapes, images, and colors to evoke a feeling of uneasiness. The lighting also aims to create the distinct ambience present in the novel. “A lot of choreographers requested deep red, somber lighting and stark, almost fluorescent lighting. They were going for dystopian isolation, as well as mysterious, dark vibes,” says technical director Tiffany Y. Lau ’19.
Another difficulty of taking such a complex and richly symbolic novel is presenting it as a performance without words. “[The dances] bring the themes to life in an abstract way … If you’ve read the book our goal is to make you feel like how you feel when you read the book,” says Coady. Choreographers looked for movement that encapsulated themes present in the novel, particularly through the interactions between the dancers. One dance, called “D I S T A N C E,” about the attraction between two characters, uses certain movements to embody this relationship. “There is a lot filling the space, but with hands not quite touching,” says dancer Margaret E. Reynolds ’20. “There are a lot of interactions that are just missed or contrasting with each other … There is a lot of tension between spaces,” she says.
Ultimately, the works endeavor to make the audience appreciate Huxley’s story and to form connections between its unique world and our present one. “I hope everyone is intrigued enough that they will go home and read the book, because it is fantastic. I hope we are really able to convey the themes of identity, all-powerful state, and censorship in our new, changing world, how this novel written in the 1930s can connect to today,” says Coady.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If a duck murders an innocent fish, and a mosquito is a witness to the crime, how will the duck keep the mosquito quiet, if not by becoming a host to the mosquito and permitting it to live the rest of its days inside the duck’s head? Michael DeForge forces readers to accept such situations in his new graphic novel, “Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero.” The graphic novel strategically uses ridiculous scenarios as a lens through which to observe a type of daily life that makes the normal feel peculiar and the peculiar feel normal. In a matter-of-fact style, DeForge imbues the book’s strange anecdotes with unexpected depth.
The plot of the book follows the day-to-day life of Sticks Angelica, a woman who leaves Ottawa after her family’s fall from fame. She spends her days in the woods pouring hot sauce on her tongue instead of eating breakfast or lunch, finding ways to stay active throughout the day, and interacting with the forest’s wildlife. The book sets up the scene in a style resembling the comics section in a newspaper. Most pages have complete mini-stories, and some pages contain series, like the one starring Lisa Hanawalt. Hers is a five-page story arc in which Sticks interacts with Lisa, a moose who wants to be human. The plot has a few flashbacks to fill in gaps necessary to understanding the overall story, but from there DeForge forms a coherent story of a part of Sticks Angelica’s life as well as the lives of some of the woodland characters.
DeForge shifts what could have been stereotypical characterizations into peculiar ones that add life to the book. Most of the characters are simply animals of the forest. There are, however, almost no two alike in either species or personality. From a rabbit enamored of Sticks to a bear with the desire to be an author to the aforementioned accidentally-murderous duck, each character is memorably unique.
Although all the captions are written in capital letters, which often connote strong emotion, the text almost never gives an emotional feel to the story. The capitalization normalizes itself through its constant use. Periods are missing at the end of speech bubbles, giving the dialogue an informal feel. The content of the scenes themselves imbues the book with a more serious tone, like when the eel tells another character about her brother’s recent suicide, or when Sticks rips the shirt that Lisa Hanawalt stole. How can one not feel pity for Lisa Hanawalt as she begins to sob? The scene, though brief, is one of many that can actually affect the reader on a surprisingly deep level.
These strong emotions are particularly unexpected given the graphics. The layout, as mentioned before, is like that of a comic strip in the newspaper. The colors are simple: black, white, and salmon. The odd, not-quite-cartoonish quality of the work looks simple, but gives careful detail to the characters and environment alike. One can quickly immerse oneself in the subplots of the book and see the most genuine of facial expressions in the simplest of lines and details.
“Sticks Angelica, Folk Hero” is an unexpected journey that is ultimately satisfying. The strangeness of the book becomes an effective part of the story. DeForge takes unexceptional animals, such as Oatmeal the Grain Rabbit, and adds extraordinary layers to them and their forest through subtle but vivid scenes. DeForge carefully constructs each page to give a glimpse into the life of an unconventional folk hero, Sticks Angelica.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This cycle's column and the next one are patently unoriginal and likely insufficient. More eloquent and qualified authors have come before me to advocate for and expound upon the relationship between the U.S. military and Harvard University. Members of the Harvard military community have written wonderfully on ROTC student life and composed critical and compelling pieces on the status of Harvard’s support for this community. I can hardly build upon what they’ve already done in any meaningful way, but I can speak to what being a part of this community has meant for me over the last year and a half.
To be sure, a year and a half is not very long at all in the grand scheme of things. Nevertheless, there are already very different threads weaving through my life than those of many of my peers and classmates. Provided nothing goes catastrophically wrong in the rest of my time here, I have already committed to a full-time job after college for a minimum of four years. (A comforting thought after taking a midterm or final.) Yet despite this post-graduation job security, there’s still a lot of competition for specialized branch service. Imagine the Infantry and Military Intelligence branches as the Goldman Sachs and McKinsey of the U.S. Army.
In this way and in countless others, ROTC is full of apparent contradictions. As one of my comrades once wrote, cadets occupy a strange space at Harvard. We are not completely civilians, as we receive military IDs after we formally commit to post-graduation service. But we are definitely not completely soldiers. We wear the uniform proudly, but we are aware that we haven’t quite earned it.
We have no idea at all what it’s like to be on the front lines, but even our youngest ranks know significantly more about the Army than almost any random person on the street. We haven’t served at all, but we’re thanked for our service in uniform.
ROTC more closely resembles an extracurricular activity than anything else, but it’s an extracurricular activity in which I’ve raised my right hand and taken an oath to defend my country. Becoming a Harvard officer is, at least to me, the ultimate honor, and there is not a flicker of doubt in my mind that I’ve chosen the right path. But I also know there is an opportunity cost to everything.
Inhabiting two such different worlds can be quite jarring, and I fear that it facilitates a deep cultural divide between military and civilian life. I’ll admit I’m usually taken aback when I have to explain the difference between officers and enlisted personnel to someone (they’re analogous to managers and employees in a large retail firm), because to me this should be fairly common knowledge, even to civilians. Explaining the concept of ROTC is occasionally a surprise, because, again, this seems to me like it should be fairly common knowledge.
I know these questions are well-intended, and usually spark great conversations. I know people must surely make assumptions about us when we run around in PT (Physical Training) uniforms that should have been left in the 1980s, or in combat fatigues whose digital camo patterns would not conceal us in cyberspace or Middle Eastern deserts. I understand what leads people to ask me if I’m from a military family (I’m not) and even why some people feel the need to explain to me why they could never join the military or why they would never let their future kids do so.
Talking to people about ROTC or understanding their attitudes towards the military is distinctly different than talking about the rugby team, about politics and religion (my favorite dinner discussion topics), or about career aspirations. Right now, I have way more in common with students than soldiers, but it is hard to shake the occasional feeling of separation and otherness.
While good faith efforts can be made to bridge the gap between civilian and military, I don’t think it can ever be fully closed. The uniform will always be something of a barrier. Heck, it’s a barrier between members of different service components and branches. And it’s not just civilians who fail to overcome the barrier—military members often choose to retreat even farther behind it. It’s not hard to understand why service members and veterans often feel that the only people they can connect with are those who wearing the same fatigues.
Against this backdrop, Harvard and the military face no small task in attempting to facilitate meaningful connections and support between their respective institutions. There are only nine current Army ROTC cadets, 13 Navy ROTC midshipmen, three Marine-option midshipmen, and eight Air Force ROTC cadets. (Hopefully more are on the way!)
It’s no wonder why ROTC students often feel excluded and ignored by the administration. Harvard does a great deal to commemorate its illustrious military past, but its military future is uncertain at best. There’s more at stake for the Harvard community at large in preserving a more certain military future. We’ll look at that next time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students’ free speech rights are constantly suppressed across American college campuses. Recently, a student sued Los Angeles Pierce College after he was prohibited from passing out pocket constitutions outside the college’s “free speech zone”, which confines speech activities to a small outdoor area.
Harvard is no exception; it has speech codes that clearly infringe upon students’ First Amendment rights. One example is Harvard’s racial harassment policy, which bars students from “using racial epithets, making racially derogatory remarks, and using racial stereotypes.” The wording used in this speech code is far too vague and therefore threatens students’ free speech rights.
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states, “Congress shall make no law […] abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Harvard is a private institution and is not legally bound by the First Amendment. However, Harvard is considered to be an institution that encourages America’s best and brightest to pursue truth. In order to do so effectively, Harvard must foster diversity in intellectual thought and therefore respect students’ right to free speech, regardless of how different and controversial it may be.
However, Harvard was given a “red light” categorization by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education for having at least one policy that obstructs freedom of speech. FIRE is a non-profit organization that “defends and sustains individual rights at America’s colleges and universities.” Harvard’s “red light” policy defines racial harassment “as actions on the part of an individual or group that demean or abuse another individual or group because of racial or ethnic background. Such actions may include, but are not restricted to, using racial epithets, making racially derogatory remarks, and using racial stereotypes.” We must keep in mind that what is offensive to one person may not be offensive to another.
For speech to not be protected by the U.S. Constitution, it must follow the Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education ruling, which states that speech must be “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims’ educational experience, that the victims are effectively denied equal access to an institution’s resources and opportunities.” Thus, a term must fall under the pattern of “so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive,” for it to not be recognized as protected speech.
We need to reform Harvard’s policies. If we do not, we might experience problems that have already surfaced at other universities. For example, a chalk message, “Trump 2016,” was written on Emory University’s sidewalks. Many students found this offensive and reported it as “hate speech” to the administrators. If Harvard does not reform its speech codes, it could potentially have an incident where someone’s free speech rights are seriously encroached upon.
As a solution, Laura Beltz from FIRE suggested the following policy to replace Harvard’s current racial harassment code: “The College defines racial harassment as actions on the part of an individual or group that demean or abuse another individual or group because of racial or ethnic background, "and that are so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that the individual or group is effectively denied equal access to the College’s resources and opportunities." Such actions may include, but are not restricted to, using racial epithets, making racially derogatory remarks, and using racial stereotypes, "when they are part of a pattern of conduct that rises to the level of the standard set forth above.” The replacement language is in line with the First Amendment and also emphasizes the language from the Davis ruling.
Why must we embrace free speech? Colleges and universities afford students the opportunity to voluntarily exchange ideas that help them to mature intellectually and prepare for life after graduation. That is why it is crucial for campus speech codes to reflect the First Amendment. If administrators continue to coddle students and impose unnecessary bans that impede the free exchange of thoughts and ideas, how can we expect them to create value in society? As Erika Christakis, a former Yale College faculty member, stated in her open letter, “Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re one of the lucky 2,056 students who were fortunate enough to receive an acceptance letter from the Admissions Office last Thursday, congratulations! There is so much waiting in store for you here.
As you begin to make a decision about where to spend the next four years of your life, bear in mind some of the unique, idiosyncratic traditions Harvard holds: for example, last month’s Housing Day, where freshmen find out which of the 12 Houses they’ve been sorted into, and the House system itself, a powerful hub for student life.
Both inside and outside the Houses, there is so much to see and do, so many ways to leave your mark. Harvard is not just the ivy-covered, austere, centuries-old university many imagine. It is constantly being changed, transformed, and opened to new ideas. Tradition may be king, but there is nothing wrong with making some of your own. Every student brings something unique to Cambridge and leaves their own stamp on campus.
Each one of you, as potential Harvard College students, holds the requisite energy, drive, and insight to help make this campus better, especially as major debates occur over the future of student life. You need not think you must save the world or be the best of your peers. Every action you make, big or small, will be felt. These are not merely maudlin clichés, but an invitation to make this campus yours in any way you wish, with the added benefit that you will change too.
On these pages, we have sought to be cognizant of the University’s shortcomings and have often been vocal about them in the past. We critique this campus, though, not out of malice or hatred, but because we want a better Harvard. We want a better community for ourselves and for you—the Class of 2021.
At Harvard, you are home. You have the right to feel like you belong, and demand change if you're not. That's how Harvard continues to improve. Your role in the Harvard community will undoubtedly ask a lot of you; you also have the right to ask a lot of Harvard.
No matter where you choose to go, your experience is what you make it—but we want to stress that at Harvard, you can always find your place. No matter where you've been, where you're now, or where you will be going next, Cambridge can be yours for the next four years. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana loves to talk of “transformative experiences,” an oft-hackneyed phrase, but even the cynical end up walking away changed. The next four years will be your best. We hope you spend them at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2017 at 6:41 p.m. 
The seven-minute passing period between courses known as “Harvard Time” will no longer exist beginning in the fall of 2018.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted Tuesday to adopt a new course schedule that extends the length of most courses to 75 minutes with 15 minutes of passing time between classes. Ahead of the planned opening of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences’s Allston campus in 2020, the new schedule aims to give students more time to travel across the river.
Faculty members approved an amended version of a motion first presented last month by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
Courses lasting longer than an hour, including some labs and seminars, will be restricted to certain time slots under the new schedule. Harris’s original motion outlined a schedule with 45 minute separations between the start of Cambridge and Allston courses; the earliest Cambridge courses will start at 9 a.m and Allston courses will begin at 9:45 a.m. Courses could begin as late as 7:30 p.m in Cambridge and 8:15 p.m in Allston.
At the meeting, James Engell, a professor of English and Comparative Literature, presented an amended version of the original proposal, which would allow two hour seminars to begin at 9:45 a.m., the only exception to an otherwise rigidly structured start and end time structure. The Faculty overwhelmingly supported Engell’s motion after University President Drew G. Faust called for a vote by hand count.
“Allowing faculty to start a two hour seminar at 9:45 a.m. with the dean's permission may make the option more attractive to the faculty many of whose days last longer than 6:00 pm,” Engell said. “I believe that this amendment would mean that more faculty would teach their two hour seminars in the morning.”
A committee will reevaluate the new schedule in 2019.
The new schedule was not without its detractors. A few audible “nays” could be heard during the vote.
Music professor Anne C. Shreffler questioned whether or not the new schedule would encourage more night classes, which could create a conflict between student performing groups and FAS courses.
“The perception seems to be that the number of evening courses is increasing,” Shreffler said. “I think it would be wise or prefered if evening classes were no longer further encouraged.”
Harris denied that the proposed changes were in any way encouraging more night classes.
“There is truly nothing in this proposal that encourages anything that isn’t currently happening,” Harris said.
While presenting his amendment, Engell urged the Faculty to support Harris’s motion regardless of the success of his amendment.
“We’re looking ahead to the possibility of a new schedule and a new campus. It looks a little bit like a new pinball game you have to master, but I think it will work,” Engell said.

UPDATED: April 4, 2017 at 8:30 p.m.
Members of the Harvard chapter of national fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi will disaffiliate from the organization and form a new, gender neutral social group, undergraduate chapter president Jake Ascher ’19 announced Tuesday.
The Eta Psi chapter of AEPi is the first of Harvard’s nine Greek organizations to go co-ed following the announcement of Harvard’s historic penalties on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations. The College’s policy will bar undergraduate members of these groups—starting with the Class of 2021—from certain leadership positions, athletic captaincies, and postgraduate fellowships.
In a written statement released to The Crimson Tuesday, current members of the chapter announced they had “voted to become a gender neutral organization” and will hold a gender-neutral rush next fall. In order to do so, the group has been forced to disaffiliate from AEPi’s national organization.
“Beginning next semester our rush process will be open to all Harvard undergraduates, regardless of gender identity,” the statement reads. “Our chapter has long debated the issues of gender inclusion and neutrality, but the announcement of the sanctions certainly spurred our decision,” it continues.
Ascher said Harvard’s Eta Psi members first discussed going gender neutral in May 2016 at a chapter-wide meeting held just after University President Drew G. Faust announced the College’s penalties. He said that meeting, intended to “take the temperature of the group,” largely decided the chapter’s future course.
“From then it seemed already inevitable that we would eventually make that change [and go gender neutral],” Ascher said.
The group continued discussing the idea until earlier this semester, when members gathered and officially voted to make this fall’s upcoming rush gender neutral. Though Ascher said the chapter has not been in contact with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, members have met with Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
Ascher said that the group’s decision to go gender neutral was sparked both by the College’s penalties and by chapter members’ “willingness and desire” to do so.
“The sanctions are certainly what prompted us to do this, but I think that if we would’ve firmly disagreed ideologically with what the sanctions are trying to ultimately do, then we would have been eager to fight the sanctions rather than to change our organization,” Ascher said.
After learning the chapter intended to hold a gender neutral rush next fall, Khurana said he was pleased by the group’s plans.
“I applaud the members and leaders of the chapter on its decision to become more equitable and inclusive. The College looks forward to working with this new organization in our collective efforts to make our campus more gender inclusive,” Khurana said.
Ascher said the group will seek the newly designated “Provisional Social Organization” status, a “transitional category” for organizations going gender neutral approved by Khurana. Provisional Social Organizations must regularly publish a “demographic breakdown of the organization’s membership.”
Ascher said Friedrich assured chapter members that their plan put them on the right path towards “Provisional Social Organization” status, and towards eventually becoming a recognized student social group.
Since voting to go gender neutral, chapter members have worked to update the group’s rush and pledge processes to accommodate those who do not identify as male. Ascher said there are certain traditions the group will have to discontinue, but added he did not think the chapter’s identity would be altered.
“We’re not worried about this changing the fundamental character of the group because… the most important aspect of our group was never the fact that all of us were men,” Ascher said.
Ascher declined to comment on how the organization’s historically Jewish identity may be affected by regular publication of group demographics. But in their statement, chapter members reaffirmed their commitment to “Jewish values.”
“We will continue to uphold the Jewish values and traditions that have defined our group,” the statement reads. “We have always identified as a Jewish organization, yet we have never discriminated based on religion, and we never will in the future.”
AEPi’s national leadership would not allow the group to admit women and retain its status as a chapter affiliate, according to Ascher.
“What [the national organization] expressed to us is that we cannot admit women into our chapter, so if we want to have women or people who don’t identify as males in our organization, we would have to start a new organization and leave theirs,” Ascher said.
The AEPi national organization could not be reached for comment Tuesday evening.
While the group-to-be does not yet have a name or a finalized structure, Ascher said the new organization will not use gender-based quotas in their upcoming fall recruitment process. Though Ascher said the group will continue to re-evaluate its identity in the months ahead, at least one approach is off the table.
“We are not going to be a final club,” he said.
Other single-gender organizations have gone gender neutral ahead of the policy’s slated implementation in fall 2017. Most recently, the all-female Sabliere Society rebranded itself as the Sab Club and inducted its inaugural class of men. The previously all-female group the Seneca and the all-male Spee Club have taken similar steps. Earlier this semester, the Oak Club became the first all-male group to transition to a gender-neutral membership policy following the announcement of the sanctions.
The policy, however, may change. A committee of faculty, students, and staff created in January and co-chaired by Khurana is currently reviewing the policy and could “revise or replace” it.

After Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced the names of the six newly elected members to the Faculty Council at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, he pointed out a commonality.
“They are all men,” he said.
The six members—Astronomy professor Edo Berger,  Romance Languages and Literatures professor Sergio Delgado, Music professor Vijay Iyer, Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, Economics professor Jeffrey Miron, and Economics professor Elie Tamer—will begin their three-year terms on the Faculty of Arts Sciences’s highest-elected body in July.
Of the 20 members currently serving on the Faculty Council for the 2016-2017 year, five are women. The six additions for the next year will not move the Council closer to gender parity.
“We must find a way to make sure that we do not lose the richness of perspectives that our Council has enjoyed in the past,” Smith said. “It is time for us to redouble our efforts in this space.”
Smith said he has asked the FAS’s Standing Committee on Women to look into the issue.
Faculty Council member David L. Howell mentioned the all-male slate in his remarks about the Council’s most recent biweekly meeting.
“We look forward to welcoming our six new colleagues to the Council next fall, but we share the surprise and alarm that most of you no doubt feel that no women were elected to the Council this year,” he said.
Smith said that a record number of Faculty members cast ballots in the election. Candidates for Faculty Council seats are nominated and voted on by the entire faculty.
Another point of concern for some Faculty members at the meeting was a proposed "Thinking with Data" course requirement.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented a motion proposing that a committee be formed to study the implementation of the requirement, which would focus on skills such as data analysis and acquisition.
According to materials distributed to attendees before the meeting, courses in this category could be created from scratch or reshaped from introductory Statistics department courses.
“We are convinced that all of our students need to have these skills,” Harris said.
After Harris presented the motion, several professors raised concerns about its mission and implementation.
Two mathematics professors questioned whether the requirement was drawn too narrowly. One of the professors, Joseph D. Harris, also asked how the FAS would manage the large amount of infrastructure required for a class that all undergraduates must take.
“Where are we going to get the faculty at a time where most departments are being told that they can’t hire because of lack of money?” he said.
Two professors in the social sciences said they felt that the definition of “data” used in the report and the requirement was too vague.
In his responses, Harris said questions like these would be explored by an implementation committee for the requirement.
The Faculty’s first opportunity to vote on Harris’s motion will arrive at the May Faculty meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 5, 2017 at 2:42 p.m.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences criticized the College’s proposed plan for enforcing penalties on members of single-gender social organizations at their monthly meeting Tuesday, again clashing with administrators on a topic that has dominated Faculty discussion for months.
Last month, a committee tasked with creating recommendations for enforcing the penalties proposed that the Honor Council—which usually deals with violations of Harvard’s academic Honor Code—investigate students who violate the policy by “falsely affirming compliance.” At Tuesday’s meeting, several Faculty members took issue with the proposed plan, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said that the Faculty may need to approve the Honor Council’s new role.
Shortly after the meeting began, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 asked if the Faculty would conduct a vote to amend the student handbook and grant the Honor Council an expanded role.
“May we be assured that you will bring amended legislation to this Faculty before expanding the remit of the Honor Council beyond what the Faculty previously voted to delegate to it?” Lewis asked.
“We are exploring an affirmation of awareness of the policy,” Khurana said. “If this affects the student handbook we will of course use the normal review policy for recommending changes.”
In March, Khurana accepted nearly all of the recommendations that the committee submitted to him in its 46-page report.
Lewis—who withdrew a motion opposing the sanctions in January following the announcement of a new faculty committee that could “revise or replace” the current social policy—argued that the Honor Council currently does not have the authority to investigate students who transgress the policy.
Contention over the single-gender social organization policy did not abate after Lewis’s comments. Faculty also discussed a motion professor David A. Haig submitted opposing a proposed requirement that students applying to leadership positions, athletic captaincies, or postgraduate fellowships sign a pledge stating they do not belong to a single-gender social group.
“This faculty does not approve of Harvard College requiring a student to make an oath, pledge or affirmation about whether the student belongs to a particular organization or category of organizations,” Haig’s motion reads.
Ultimately, the Faculty voted not to debate Haig’s motion directly, instead sending it to the faculty committee that is studying whether to revise or replace the policy entirely. Haig is a member of that committee. The Docket committee first recommended that the Faculty punt on the motion.
“The USGSO committee was created to be precisely this type of platform for precisely these types of concerns,” Jennifer L. Roberts, the chair of the docket committee, said. “Given that Professor Haig is already a member of the committee, the Faculty Council is also worried that his motion might circumvent the committee.”
Still, several Faculty members disagreed with the vote to send the motion to the faculty committee.
“I hope that colleagues consider this motion to refer seriously,” James Engell, an English and comparative literature professor, said. “This motion to refer is a way of continuing to remove from the Faculty its power of discussion and voting on this matter.”
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas said Khurana’s deep level of involvement in the new committee was cause for concern. Khurana will co-chair the committee that is re-evaluating the policy he originally formulated.
“The dean responsible for promulgating the policy is co-chair of this committee,” Thomas said, “This leaves me again with an uneasiness.”
Following Thomas’s comment, Smith defended his decision to select Khurana as one of the committee’s chairs.
“I’m responsible for the co-chairs that we have. Certainly, Dean Khurana is associated with a particular point of view, but I believe that Dean Khurana is open-minded,” Smith said. “We are quite a ways into the discussion of this policy. I did not think an independent group, completely disconnected from the College would make sense.”
The faculty committee will submit its recommendations or amendments to the policy, which, beginning with the class of 2021, bars members of single-gender social organizations from club leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain post-graduate fellowships, in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 5, 2017 at 2:47 p.m.
The cost of attending Harvard College will be $65,609 in the 2017-2018 academic year, representing a 4.10 percent increase from last year—the largest percent increase since the height of the 2008 recession.
The rise in costs for board will be the most significant increase in the “sticker price” at 5 percent. Tuition will also increase to $44,990 next year along with a climb in room costs and miscellaneous fees at 4.10 percent and 4.35 percent, respectively.
The rising cost of attendance comes in the wake of poor returns on the University’s endowment that could “significantly constrain” budgets in years to come. Harvard’s endowment posted a negative 2 percent return in fiscal year 2016, shrinking by almost $2 billion and forcing cost-cutting measures across the University.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences in particular has been affected by budget strains as the University’s largest arm plans on running a “reasonably small” budget deficit next year in order to continue long-term projects like House Renewal.
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences—a part of FAS—will reduce the number of admitted graduate students by 4.4 percent, and current students will notice an unusually small stipend increase compared to recent years.
The cost of attendance surpassed $60,000 for the first time in 2015, continuing a long-term trend that has included a 31 percent jump between 1998 and 2015 when adjusted for inflation, according to a report by The Chronicle for Higher Education. During the financial crisis, the College increased the cost of enrollment by 4.50 percent for the 2007-2008 academic year.
According to a College Board report on national trends in university tuition, the “sticker price,” also known as the “published price,” of tuition and fees at private nonprofit four-year universities rose by an average of 3.6 percent for the 2016-17 academic year.
The College admitted 2,056 students to the Class of 2021 Thursday, and more than half of all undergraduates receive need-based financial aid through the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative. Students from families with annual incomes under $65,000—comprising roughly one in five undergraduates—are not expected to contribute to the cost of attending Harvard.
The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative was first launched in 2004 under then-President Lawrence H. Summers and awarded more than $172 million to undergraduates in 2016. Last year, the College also announced that students from low-income families would receive “start-up” grants in addition to their existing financial aid packages to help with incidental costs that students incur when transitioning to college.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Title IX Office will split into two distinct offices in an administrative restructuring that formally separates administrators who investigate sexual assault complaints from those who provide Title IX training and resources.
Nearly three months after the departure of former Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, the University announced Wednesday that Deputy Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill will replace her. But unlike the role Karvonides played as Title IX Officer, Merhill will not oversee investigations.
Instead, Bill D. McCants, who has served as the acting Title IX Officer since Karvonides’s departure in January, will oversee investigations as the director of the newly-created Office of Dispute Resolution, which replaces the Office of Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution. Merhill’s office will focus primarily on “proactive” training initiatives and providing support for those who have experienced sexual assault, Merhill said in an interview.
The University has also hired Julia Sáenz, formerly a Title IX Associate, to fill a new position of Assistant Title IX Officer. The “paired” offices will share the same space and an administrative aide, and both will report to Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell.
The administrative changes come three years after the Title IX Office was first created in 2014. Initially understaffed, the office—tasked with handling sexual assault complaints from across the University—faced difficulties managing a growing caseload. Karvonides established a pipeline program to grow the office, and helped develop a new University-wide Title IX policy and set of procedures.
“This is a change being made in response to feedback from the community and a desire to enable the Title IX Office to expand its menu of trainings and educational opportunities across the University,” Newell said in a statement.
Newell talked to administrators and groups involved in sexual assault prevention and response efforts across the University before devising the new structure. McCants said some felt that under the previous system, the responsibility for prevention and adjudication fell too heavily upon the lone Title IX Officer.
"It’s partly perception," McCants said in an interview. "The Title IX officer was doing education, prevention, handling notice, and overseeing investigations, and there were some who felt that that is wearing too many hats.”
The most vocal challenge to the Title IX Office’s central structure came from the Law School, which crafted its own procedures for investigating sexual assault complaints that skirt the central process. In an editorial in the Boston Globe, 28 Law School professors charged that the University’s procedures are “stacked against the accused” and placed “the functions of investigation, prosecution, fact-finding, and appellate review in one office.”
McCants said dividing Title IX responsibilities between two offices creates a degree of distance between the support and investigative functions of Title IX administrators.
“It just means that the Title IX Officer will no longer be directly involved in investigations,” McCants said. Previously, the Title IX Officer was responsible both for working to provide interim accommodations and resources to people who had experienced sexual assault and investigating formal complaints, sometimes performing both roles for the same individual cases.
“Now, that won’t be a concern,” McCants said.
McCants will supervise ODR in investigating and adjudicating Title IX complaints, although Merhill will still select faculty and senior administrators to hear appeals of the results of those investigations. The Title IX Office will handle informal resolutions and provide interim support to people who have experienced sexual assault, in addition to developing educational programming.
“I don’t think there is a huge shift from Mia’s work to the work I will be doing as a Title IX officer; rather, it’s continuing the good work of this office and really staying focused on our mission of ensuring gender equity,” Merhill said.
Merhill said her top priority as she assumes her new role is collaborating with groups across the University, including the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and student organizations.
“It’s always a challenge to ensure that we are responding to each of the unique needs of the various different schools and units that we serve,” Merhill said. “I think that’s the biggest challenge that we face as a central Title IX office.”
Coordination across schools poses a perennial challenge for Harvard’s central administrators, particularly in the realm of sexual assault prevention. A University task force released a report last year outlining a set of recommendations for sexual assault prevention measures, and a year later, schools have made uneven progress in implementing these. Merhill said her office will work to develop online training modules for each of Harvard’s schools, as well as an online module for staff, by July 1.
McCants, meanwhile, said he will focus on investigating Title IX complaints and may develop ODR as a resource for civil rights issues beyond Title IX.
“We’re grateful and excited for the support the University has given to this office over time to get us fully staffed, because that has made an enormous difference in being able to serve the community,” McCants said. “Part of that was very much driven by students… we’re grateful for the students who stepped forward and said, ‘We think that Harvard should make these resources available.’”
Both civil rights attorneys, Merhill and McCants worked together at the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights before coming to Harvard. McCants became a Deputy Title IX Officer in 2014, and Merhill arrived in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cantabrigians held a public meeting Tuesday evening to learn about and discuss &pizza’s plans to move into Harvard Square, with some residents voicing concerns that &pizza’s arrival may detract from the Square’s unique character.
Residents were vocal in expressing their concerns—large and small—regarding &pizza’s potential impact to the Square, including what they characterized as too large a storefront. The Washington, D.C.-based pizza chain plans to move into two adjacent spaces on Brattle St. that formerly housed newsstand Crimson Corner and restaurant Tory Row.
African and African American Studies and History of Art and Architecture professor Suzanne P. Blier opened the meeting, which was held at the Cambridge Savings Bank and attended by Cambridge City Councillors, Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson, representatives from &pizza and its architectural firm, and several dozen residents.
After the Cambridge Historical Commission said there would not be another public meeting about &pizza, Blier and the new local advocacy group Harvard Square Neighborhood Association set up Tuesday’s meeting. &pizza co-founder and chief executive Michael Lastoria attended the meeting to respond to residents’ concerns.
Blier said she wants plans for the eatery to better fit in with Harvard Square’s historical character.
“When we think about any new building, any kind of new engagement, we’re thinking about the broader setting,” Blier said. “The Brattle Street building—there was a lot of concern just because right now Harvard Square is so hot within the context of commercial development, and there’s the sense that we really want to retain some piece of it going forward.”
Resident Marilee B. Meyer said that while the plans had improved since their original presentation, she was concerned about how the building’s branding—which many characterized “sterile” and contemporary—would look in the Square.
“What I am envisioning is something that’s very modern and sleek and basically shopping mall-worthy, and not historically appropriate for that kind of building and the surrounding context,” Meyer said.
One attendee said she was worried about whether the &pizza storefront would “enhance the unique character of the Square,” as it will be located in a central spot at the Square’s main intersection and right outside its MBTA stop.
Another resident later echoed this same concern: “Just try to understand where we’re coming from and try to understand that this isn’t any location, this is the center of Harvard Square,” she said. “It will form what people think about Harvard Square.”
Lastoria said that &pizza’s existing stores are all different, as each tries to fit well in its respective neighborhood.
“We spend a tremendous amount of time making sure that each shop reflects the neighborhood and community,” Lastoria said. &pizza also plans to display local artists’ work under the outside awnings and inside the store and plans to hire directly from Cambridge residents, according to Lastoria.
“It’s not just another pizza shop,” Lastoria said. “You see articles about being a good neighbor published nationally about all the work that we’ve done in terms of giving back. About being the ‘anti-chain chain.’”
Cambridge Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen questioned how &pizza would affect future economics of the Square.
“Folks here really just want to see a vibrant Square,” Mazen said. “If you change the character of the Square too much, you won’t be a beneficiary of the Square’s success.”
Another meeting has been scheduled for April 19 for continued discussion with Lastoria before &pizza’s plans continue in the zoning review process.

Former President of Tunisia Moncef Marzouki discussed the ideological differences that led to the Arab Spring and the importance of democracy and the fight against corruption in an event at the Kennedy School on Tuesday night.
Before his election to office in 2011, Marzouki taught community medicine and established himself as a prominent human rights and anti-child abuse activist in Tunisia.
On Tuesday, Marzouki sharply condemned the corrupt dictatorships that led to civil unrest in the Arab Spring uprisings, including Tunisia’s own revolution that lasted from Dec. 2010 to Jan. 2011.
“It’s striking to see that no leaders or supporters of the dictatorship have expressed regret or apologized,” he said.
Marzouki spoke at length about diplomacy between Western and Middle Eastern countries in his talk, and said he thinks some governments have “provided unconditional support to the regime in place, regardless of their human rights records.”
He said that he found many Western countries’ commitments to democracy unclear.
“To them, a stable regime—fighting terrorism, protecting borders from illegal immigration, and opening markets to Western influence—is the ideal regime and it does not matter if it is corrupt,” Marzouki said.
He then spoke of the consequences of the Tunisian Revolution, saying that he found changing a government from a dictatorship to a democracy “is the most complicated and difficult thing in the world.” Marzouki oversaw the country’s transition to democracy after he assumed office shortly after the revolution.
Marzouki said that the homogenous population of Tunisia aided their transition into a democracy in his term as president.
“Ninety percent of our society is comprised of Arab Muslim Sunnis… The middle class represents a large proportion of society. Our military is professional, and has no history of encroachment of economic or political activities,” he said. “Our civil society is very strong, vigilant, responsible, flexible, and peaceful.”
He added that reaching a political consensus is much less likely in countries like Libya, Egypt, and Yemen with more diverse populations or with a “military institution deeply involved in politics and economy and corruption.”
Overall, Marzouki said he thinks Tunisians can be “proud” of the progress they have made in creating a democratic government.
“We have proven that Islam and Democracy are compatible. Secularists and Islamists can work together,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
G.E.N.I.
That’s the acronym plastered in bold print upon the back of Crimson goaltender Merrick Madsen’s hockey helmet. And perched above custom-painted American and California state flags, the letters command some serious real estate.
Unsurprisingly, the characters caught the attention of Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 at the start of the season. However, the 13th-year skipper couldn’t make sense of them. So he asked his junior netminder for an explanation.
“I said what does that mean, and [Madsen] said, ‘Well we’ve made it to the tournament and we made it to the league championship last year, but as a group, good is not good enough. We want to win. We want to advance. We want to win...the opportunities we have for championships.”
The acronym technically stands for ‘Good Enough Never Is,’ a maxim befitting of Madsen—a winner of a program-record 28 games already, but still a steely seeker of two more.
With a series-clinching victory over Yale on March 11, Madsen matched that single-season record with victory No. 24, moving into a tie with Grant Blair ’86. Then in the games that followed, the Philadelphia Flyers prospect proceeded not only to eclipse Blair’s senior-season mark—he blew past it.
In four consecutive elimination games—two in the ECAC tournament and two true do-or-die contests in the NCAA Tournament—Madsen allowed a total of four goals and put together an astounding .967 save percentage. To hardly anyone’s surprise, the netminder subsequently earned the title of Most Outstanding Player for both the ECAC playoffs and the East Regional.
“He’s unbelievable,” said sophomore Ryan Donato after Harvard’s 4-1 win over Cornell in the ECAC championship game. “He’s a brick wall back there. Obviously we’re very fortunate to have him…. He’s been great for us this year, and hopefully he can stay hot.”
Over the course of the Crimson’s current 18-game unbeaten streak, Madsen boasts a 1.69 goals against average and a .938 save percentage—decimal points higher than the mark he produced a year ago (.931) that went down as the third-best seasonal clip in program history. Those numbers both rank third among Division I goaltenders with 10-plus starts since mid-January.
Despite his impressive sophomore save percentage, however, Madsen didn’t even appear in 18 consecutive games a year ago, never mind remain unbeaten over such a span. Surrendering a handful of starts early on to promising freshman tender Michael Lackey, Madsen didn’t truly lock down the starting job until the end of January.
These days, there’s no such thing as a goalie competition. Lackey, who had been banged up for a significant chunk of his rookie season, underwent hip surgery over the summer, leaving Madsen as ‘the guy.’
Knowing what would be asked of him, Madsen—an Acton, Calif., native—elected to spend the summer in Cambridge, where he skated with the members of the team who remained close to campus. More importantly, he was able to participate in Harvard’s “summer dog” workouts, which allowed the rising junior to work on his overall strength ahead of a season in which he’s spent 96.9 percent of minutes in the crease.
“When I came in, I was really lanky, and [Coach Donato] wanted me to fill out,” said Madsen, referring to his freshman frame. “I think staying here for the summer… I ended up putting on like 10-15 pounds and added a lot of strength.”
The Crimson’s roster claims that the junior still carries the 6’5”, 190-pound frame he allegedly arrived on campus with, but the truth can’t always be captured by a roster sheet. Much like the truth can’t always be captured by a stat sheet.
Madsen’s 2016-2017 numbers have been weighed down to a degree because of a five-day stretch in January that Harvard by now has put in its rearview. The Crimson dropped three consecutive games—including stunning losses to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Dartmouth, which saw Madsen yanked in favor of freshman back-up Cameron Gornet. Madsen surrendered 12 goals in roughly seven periods of action—more than he allowed in 18 periods over the entire month of March.
Three days after the Tuesday loss at Dartmouth, Harvard turned around to play conference bottom-feeder Brown at home—just what the doctor ordered. A day after a practice that assistant coach Rob Rassey considered one of Madsen’s best since joining the Crimson, the goaltender put together a performance worthy of Harvard’s Player of the Game hat, stopping all 26 shots he saw to get the Crimson back in the win column.
Yet, when you earn the hat, you don’t get to wear it for free. You’re also on the hook for a speech.
Now, Madsen may be an Applied Mathematics concentrator, but he can certainly string his words together. But locker room addresses have given the junior trouble in the past. So much so that after an award-winning performance from Madsen a year ago in South Bend, Ind., Kyle Criscuolo ’16 gave someone else the hat because, per the goaltender, the former co-captain didn’t “want to hear one of my boring speeches again.”
However, after the Brown game, Madsen took a quote from the team’s debrief for the week to enhance his speech.
“It’s easier to become great than it is to stay great,” Madsen repeated for reporters. “I just kept it short and sweet, and that’s all I said. We got the bus in the right direction, we’ve just got to keep it rolling.”
“Short and sweet” must have worked because Harvard hasn’t dropped a game since. And as for that bus, it just dropped off the Chicago-bound Crimson at Logan Airport.
But the story doesn’t end there. After all, Harvard still has at least more game to play. Of course, an appearance in the Frozen Four is already plenty good enough for the Crimson to call this season a resounding success. But then again, good enough never is.

We taught you how to spot section kid, and now you just can’t stop rolling your eyes at their blatant try hard-ness. Now, we bring you the next level of nuance in section analysis: “unpacking” the most common and most annoying lead-ins to section discussion.
Can we unpack that?
Let’s unpack the word “unpack”—this student wants something explained, but thinks that they can mask their confusion and sound intellectual by inviting their peers to engage in the scholarly “unpacking” process.
I'm gonna have to push back on that.
This is section speak for “you’re about to get wrecked.” Nothing good ever follows this opener. This student thinks you’re dumb, insensitive, or somehow misinformed, and is about to lay down the law. Academic aggression lurks behind this thin veil of language, causing even the section sleeper's ears to perk up in roast anticipation.
I want to echo (smart classmate who does all the reading)’s point.
This student has not done the reading and wants to piggyback off the ideas of their more studious peers. It’s always nice to hear that someone else favors our view, but in this case, we know that the student is just trying to boost their participation grade without doing any real work. (Granted, we have all been this student once.)
To play devil’s advocate for a second…
Essentially, this student is the devil. They are about to disagree with the rest of the class—and possibly also the laws of morality and nature—while passing it off as intellectual engagement.
This passage reminds me of (insert impressive philosophy that was not in the reading).
This student is just being a show off. We get that they are smart and well read. Congrats, but please don’t make the rest of the us look bad in comparison. It should be enough to do the assigned reading without making connections to Hume’s theory of the self.

Although it may seem like 2007 happened only a few years ago, a whole decade has passed since that memorable middle school (elementary school??) time. As 2007 was unquestionably the last good year for pop culture (High School Musical 2 anyone?) and life in general (if you weren’t Britney), we want to throwback to those Myspace-filled days by listening to the appropriate hits. Luckily, this April, plenty of 2007 bangers are celebrating their anniversary, so we made a list of all the best songs turning ten years old this month. Warning: our list is going to make you feel ~ancient~.
“Girlfriend” by Avril Lavigne
An anthem for anyone with an unrequited middle school crush, this bubblegum banger was released on April 17 with Lavigne’s absolutely iconic album “The Best Damned Thing.” Ten years later, we still rock out to this guilty pleasure when thinking about that cuffed section cutie. Don’t lie—this empowering classic totally makes you sing your heart out in the shower.
“Umbrella” by Rihanna feat. Jay-Z
Released on March 29th (close enough!), this jam forever changed the trajectory of our queen’s career. And while now Rihanna is so iconic she even got honored by Harvard, back in the day she picked up “Umbrella” from Britney’s rejects pile. This is truly the glo-up of a decade. #goals
“Thnks fr th Mmrs” by Fall Out Boy
2007 was certainly a simpler time—only then could Kim Kardashian star in a music video for an iconic emo band alongside a bunch of actual chimpanzees. Ten years ago, we were blessed with one of the most bizarre music videos of all time. We suggest you revisit this angsty piece before Kris Jenner tries to erase it due to Kim’s unfortunate cameo.
“Back to Black” by Amy Winehouse
Certain to make any breakup playlist, this tragic soul hit released on April 30 is our go-to soundtrack for heartbreaks, rejections, or plain Sunday scaries. Still as iconic ten years later, “Back to Black” even got revived as an instrumental cover in everyone’s favorite winter binge “Westworld.”
“Fluorescent Adolescent” by Arctic Monkeys
Mentioning this indie staple will certainly make an impression on that cute hipster barista. And even though you might never get the arcane lyrics, you can still appreciate this bangin British tune turning ten this April.
“Sexy Lady” by Yung Berg
You might have never heard of this hip hop number, but in 2007 everyone got down to this dated club banger released on April 3. It was so #basic, it probably even made the Fly’s party playlist.
“What I’ve Done” by Linkin Park
Remember pirating Linkin Park albums during your awkward phase? Celebrate growing out of that angst on this song’s tenth anniversary this April (thank god your bangs don’t cover your eyes anymore).
“Working Class Hero” by Green Day
Ten years ago everybody’s childhood punk favorites covered John Lennon’s underrated solo. And although we have no idea how this random mashup happened, we still love this “Communist Manifesto” in musical form.
“Never Again” Kelly Clarkson
This is the perfect soundtrack for angrily typing an email to proctors about your annoying roommates. Seriously, this song has more raw rage than Dean Khurana at a final club mention.
“Home” by Daughtry
Although this pop rock song hasn’t stood the test of time as well as other tunes on the list, it still managed to make an appearance in American Idol and Criminal Minds.
Honorable mention:
The meme, the legend, “MMMBop” itself, was released on April 15 twenty (20!?!?) years ago, and we just couldn’t ignore this phenomenally popular hit by the one hit wonder Hanson. We especially appreciate the lyrics which have just as much substance as that final paper you b*llsh*ted an hour before the deadline.
