After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In four days, legions of young people born between 1990 and 1994 will follow in Lena Dunham’s footsteps, losing our electoral virginity in a cascade of curtains, levers, buttons, and beeps. And although I whiled away countless middle school evenings dreaming of my civic “first time”, my twenty-year-old self could not be less excited for the big day.
Living in Cambridge, I will probably have to deal with weeks of Barack Obama As Sexual Experience, professors and punks alike dumbly smiling on the street, their heads held high for no reason other than that the Messiah has come again. This is not to say that I’d prefer a Republican victory: I have little patience for light beer, prayer circles, or live ammunition.
But for me, there will be no post-electoral bliss. I am voting for Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate for president—a former governor of New Mexico who is just as accomplished as he is unassuming. More, he is absolutely certain to lose.
Some of my more establishmentarian friends have dismissed my choice as an irrational act of desperation: I’ve already come to the conclusion that one of the two major-party candidates is the lesser of two evils, so why be so vain as to throw away my vote? Besides, they continue, given my taste for taxing trans fat, pairing eventual budget cuts with eventual tax increases, and strictly regulating gun sales, I barely even qualify as a libertarian.
Whether Democratic or Republican, the sanctimonious finger-waggers have it all wrong. The semi-democratic nature of our presidential elections, which are decided by the vestigial, eighteenth-century Electoral College, means that unless you live in one of a handful of swing states, a vote for your establishment candidate of choice is no less frivolous than a vote for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein. Given that I live in Massachusetts and hail from New Jersey, it makes no sense to cast a compromise vote for a major candidate: my states’ electors will inevitably line up behind Obama, so why not just vote for the guy I like most? For the approximately 80 percent of American voters in states that are out of play, there is nothing irrational about voting outside the two-party framework.
In representing the Libertarian Party, Gary Johnson stands a principled ideologue—the result being that as an economic centrist, I have my share of differences with his policy vision. And though he calls for a quixotic, often indiscriminate 43 percent cut in federal spending, it is worth noting his support for nationwide marriage equality, marijuana legalization, an end to gratuitous military adventurism, liberal immigration policies, and strict protection of civil liberties from the meddling of the executive branch.
But unlike Ron Paul before him, Johnson is more a lifestyle libertarian than he is a constitutionalist. That is to say, his belief in limited government is one driven primarily by open-mindedness and creativity, rather than by custom. Quite unlike your average former Republican governor, he is almost never seen without his trademark peace sign t-shirt. He has smoked medical marijuana, climbed Everest and Kilimanjaro, competed in a number of triathlons, and cohabitated with an unmarried long-term partner.
Accordingly, he has no religious compunctions about abortion, same-sex marriage, or female sexuality. On the grounds of personal liberty and creative expression, he opposed the Bush-era PATRIOT Act, the Obama-era National Defense Authorization Act, and the ill-fated step toward internet censorship popularized as SOPA. Uniquely among politicians, his unwillingness to moralize about drug use has led him to become one of the greatest crusaders against a drug war that has cost tens of billions, plunged entire Latin American countries into chaos, flooded the prison system, and reified racial inequalities that most politicians cannot be bothered to acknowledge.
In sum, on issue after issue for which Obama and Romney support the same, broken status quo, Governor Gary Johnson represents a clarion call for realistic policy reform. And even though I’m not much of a libertarian poster boy, I recognize that under circumstances where my vote has in absolutely no chance of making an arithmetic difference, it is worth attempting to make a difference principle. In the coming orgiastic frenzy of either an Obama or a Romney win that will functionally amount to very little, I plan to assume the sacred role of spoiling everyone else’s unthinking fun.
To that end, I’m giving my electoral “first time” to Gary Johnson. This Tuesday, I hope you’ll lie back, think of liberty, and follow suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than a week until the presidential election, campaigns are uncharacteristically not the primary news story, and rightfully so. Over the past few days, Superstorm Sandy has pummeled the East Coast, causing more than eighty deaths in the US as it continues to swirl at the top of the news cycle. Sandy’s onslaught has meant fewer campaign events, less discussion of battleground states, and more focus on the storm’s path and burgeoning relief efforts.
How much attention should be paid to the election while New York City subway tunnels are flooded, millions are without power, and homes have been washed away? The answer may be a difficult one for political junkies to swallow, but it is obvious that the nation and the news should remain focused on the response to Superstorm Sandy.
I reached this conclusion while switching between CNN and MSNBC’s primetime coverage on Tuesday night. Both stations devoted most of their coverage to the storm and its connection to the election. They raised concerns about how the storm could affect voter turnout, discussing whether voters in the states most affected by Sandy will be willing and able to vote. This summarized the cable news programming until I spent a few minutes watching MSNBC’s The Ed Show, hosted by Ed Schultz. In his usual aggressive style, Schulz asked his two guests why Mitt Romney was not out touring the damage, talking to the “real” people affected by the storm, and taking advantage of a prime opportunity to look presidential.
I generally temper my expectations of political commentary shows, but I was still disappointed by this view of the situation. To my relief, one of the guests pointed out that a Romney trip to New Jersey or Virginia would divert important resources away from storm relief. He also correctly remarked that such a visit would appear blatantly political rather than as a genuine expression of empathy for the storm victims and would do more harm than good for Governor Romney and for the residents of the affected areas. I am also encouraged by Governor Chris Christie’s positive response to President Obama’s direction of relief efforts. The governor and the president are firmly on opposite sides of the ideological aisle, but Christie has wisely recognized that politics and campaigning can wait.
Scoring political points should not be the foremost concern in the minds of the media or the presidential candidates, but unfortunately not even an act of God can put a complete stop to political speculation and maneuvering. Commentators have zeroed in on potential political ramifications of the storm, politicians like Congressman Ed Markey (D-Mass.) have used the storm to talk about partisan disagreement over climate change, and Romney’s opponents have seized on his past comments on the size of the federal government and implications that it should do less in disaster relief.
Sandy’s aftermath is rife with political impact, and we should not comprehensively silence discussion of the election, the environment, or the size of government. Once the recovery has more significantly progressed, there should be more discussion about such issues. Of course, by the time waters have receded and power turns back on, Tuesday may have come and gone.
In the meantime, balance is absolutely necessary. Overall, the major news networks have done an admirable job of keeping attention focused on the recovery efforts and how people across the country can help the East Coast get back on its feet. Election-related interludes can and should continue, but my hope is that those without power, those who have lost loved ones, and those who now find themselves essentially homeless are not shoved aside for hypothetical electoral scenarios and perceived verbal gaffes.
There is no doubt that the election matters and that climate change and the federal bureaucracy are important issues, but right now there are millions of people with more pressing problems to worry about who deserve the national spotlight and as much help and support from the rest of the country as they can get.

The Supreme Court is in the midst of hearing a suit against the University of Texas at Austin by Abigail Fisher. She maintains she was the victim of an admissions process that elevates skin color above academic qualifications and gives unfair advantage to minorities.
But who counts as a “minority” in affirmative action? Unfortunately for Ms. Fisher, adorable gingers are not considered a minority (despite red hair occurring in only 1-2 percent of the world population). So clearly, not just any minority can qualify as a “minority.”
Perhaps affirmative action is meant to help those who have historically been discriminated against. It would be hard to overlook women and Jews when considering historical punching bags.  However, women and Jews are indeed overlooked in the affirmative action policies of most schools.
Perhaps affirmative action attempts to help those groups heavily correlated with lower incomes.  One of the strongest correlations with lower incomes is held by those with lower centers of gravity. As if short people didn’t have it bad enough: being refused at roller coasters, being unable to stand in the shallow end of pools, and now, being denied affirmative action. At least they don’t have to stand in the back for pictures.
Finally, what about intellect? Perhaps our universities are in dire need of diversity of intelligence. Counter to most stereotypes, ugliness is highly correlated with poor intellectual performance by traditional measures, though I don’t know how many qualified applicants will be willing to put that down on their application.
Race-based affirmative action attempts to target these groups: the discriminated against, the poor, and those with unique experiences and intellectual merits. However, affirmative action is fundamentally flawed because it uses race instead of targeting these groups themselves. Less academically qualified applicants should be treated as such, unless they come from poorer households and therefore do not have access to the same amount of resources as other applicants. However, this would be class-based affirmative action, not race-based.
Helping those with primarily low academic qualifications into primarily academic institutions makes as much sense as helping the visually impaired become pilots. How would you feel if you were assured before going into surgery that your surgeon was the beneficiary of affirmative action in medical school? I do not see why higher academic institutions should lower their standards for admission.
In a way, I am the product of a sort of affirmative action, and it takes a terrible psychological toll. My father went to Harvard College, which makes me a legacy.  I am kept up at night by the thought that simply because my father has attended and donated to the University, I might have taken the spot of a more qualified applicant. My name is not exactly “Sarah Wigglesworth Hurlbut Coop,” but I am still a legacy, and the thought of its bearing on my admission is somewhat terrifying.
This is not a partisan issue. Many Democrats have, in confidence, heartily agreed with my position. Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City, has flatly denied proposals for affirmative action in the competitive application process for elite public high schools: “You pass the test, you get the highest score, you get into the school—no matter what your ethnicity, no matter what your economic background is.” Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts stated it succinctly in a decision concerning affirmative action: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
The libertarian in me gags at the thought of infringing a private institution’s selection criteria, but the aspiring lawyer in me points to the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits race-based discrimination. This amendment has since been somewhat modified with the 2003 Supreme Court case upholding the University of Michigan’s use of affirmative action, Grutter v. Bollinger. In sum, the status of affirmative action has been in something of a legal flux. In the current case of Fisher v. University of Texas, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan recused herself, so a tie is possible, which would favor the defendant and uphold the status quo of legal affirmative action.
Even if affirmative action rights the injustices of widespread discrimination, as proponents allege, what about the beneficiaries down the line? As Supreme Justice Clarence Thomas argued, employers will likely regard a minority candidate with greater skepticism if their alma mater engaged in affirmative action. This wouldn’t be racism—it would be simple logic—and that is what makes it all the more nefarious. I’m not saying racism doesn’t exist. Racism persists, despite over a century of incredible progress, but affirmative action imbeds racism in the lives of future generations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Angie Epifano sparked national discussion when she opened up about her rape and its aftermath.  Her account of the mishandling of her situation by administrators at Amherst College, her former school, raises serious concerns about rape on college campuses and the obstacles that often stand in the way of justice for sexual assault victims. Epifano’s case reveals a terrible callousness on the part of the Amherst administration, which appears to have had no interest in helping Epifano. Based upon the high number of women at Amherst who have since come forward with their own stories of sexual assault, this seems to be the university’s default way of dealing with such incidents.
In a piece published in the Amherst Student, Amherst College’s student newspaper, Epifano told of how she was raped during her freshman year. When she finally overcame her personal obstacles to reporting the crime, she was met with almost no support from the system, which reportedly told her that there was nothing to be done and that, although her rape could be reported as a statistic, pursuing charges was inadvisable.
It is tragic that Amherst’s administration handled Epifano’s sexual assault case so poorly. But it is doubly so considering the myriad of barriers that already stand between sexual assault victims and justice. It is all too common that victims feel uncomfortable reporting assault, be it from misplaced feelings of guilt and shame, fear that their story will not be believed, or fear of how they will be treated once their story has become public. The act of reporting is so traumatic for so many that simply dealing with an administrative system in and of itself can be emotionally difficult—even if the administrative system in place provides comprehensive support and resources and effective counseling for the victim. That Amherst added to these barriers its own dose of reckless incompetence is profoundly upsetting.
If victims of sexual assault do not have faith in the integrity of the system charged with handling the incident, it is likely that the rates of reportage will fall below their already low level. The ensuing sense of isolation will likely cause victims   to feel disempowered and abandoned.
College administrators should be held to a much higher standard than they currently are. The administrators at Amherst need to fundamentally change the way they deal with students so as to provide respectful support to victims in this already difficult process, rather than adding yet another series of obstacles to the situation. We hope to see Amherst drastically revise its policies to reflect the absolute importance of treating sexual assault victims respectfully, and that any college dealing with similar issues to revise their policies drastically as well. In the end, there’s so much stacked against victims of sexual assault, their school should never worsen the problem.

Fifteen Minutes: You’re a PhD student in the economics department. When and how did you start thinking about race and politics?
Seth I. Stephens-Davidowitz: Really, I started thinking about Google data. And I just found Google data and was like, “Wow, you can measure pretty much anything with Google data: what people search, where they search it, when they search it.” I started thinking about Google data and then said, “What question can I ask that might be hard to answer otherwise?” And I’m kind of a political junkie, so it was in some sense natural that I’d focus on politics.
FM: Your research about the effects of racial prejudice on voting uses Google Insights, which is a relatively new tool. What does this mean as a research tool? Does it make things more accessible for political science research at Harvard and elsewhere?
SSD: It’s obvious that within a few years it’s going to be really leading to new insights on all kinds of questions, particularly the sensitive topics. Because people don’t like to admit certain things to surveys—you know, racism, drugs, sex, etc. And everybody admits everything to Google.
FM: So has your research changed the way you use Google for non-research purposes?
SSD: Yeah, I Google myself a lot more now that I’m in newspapers and stuff. Other than that, no. [Google searches are] all private and anonymous so [people who analyze them] have no clue. Nobody knows—so I’ve never been careful. I just type in whatever.
FM: You concluded that race actually does matter in electoral politics. How might racial prejudice influence the outcome of the 2012 election?
SSD: You always have to include the caveats. The future doesn’t resemble the past always. There’s no question, I think, when you look at even the early polling data. [Obama is] still struggling in many of the parts of the country where he was struggling before, certain parts of the South, West Virginia, etc., where racial animus is a big issue. He may be doing better in the Midwest than I would have expected based on the data, so that’s kind of interesting. We’ll see. I think [race] is there, it’s an issue, it’s a drag on [Obama’s] vote total in many parts of the country including some swing states. We’ll see exactly how many—if it’s as big of an effect, if it’s a little smaller of an effect. We have to wait and see the actual voting data.
FM: What will you be looking for before the election? 
 SSD: I tend to look at the Google data. You tend to get insights before polling becomes available. I knew right after Romney’s convention that it was a bust, because nobody was looking up “vote” or “voting” or “donate Romney,” whereas after every other convention these searches spike up. So in some sense you didn’t have to wait for the polling to know that that was a pretty lousy convention. Things like that. I might have some other projects in the line as well along similar veins.

Every year, literary A-listers and their worshippers descend on Copley Square for a day-long festival to celebrate the written word. The Boston Book Festival’s fourth annual celebration brought together authors as diverse as Lemony Snicket, X.J. Kennedy, Junot Diaz, and Adam Gopnik and featured over 40 events on topics as varied as “Jewish Jocks” and “How to Write a Crime Novel.”
In the Square, independent publishing houses and literary magazines set up tents as bibliophiles wandered from one to the next, leisurely chatting with friends about the books they saw and the events that they planned to attend. Adding a musical flair to the festival, the Berklee College of Music lined up six performers. Attendees enjoyed food from the Clover food truck or Ravi’s Restaurant while jazz, Argentinian and Arabic music filled the Square.
The excitement in the air was palpable: “There’s just nothing like it on this scale,” said Allston resident Bryan Monroe.
“So often the literary scene is private—you receive your book or your magazine in the mail, you read it and it’s wonderful, but there’s rarely a chance to discuss it with other people. It’s one of the reasons why I love the festival, because so many like-minded people who are interested in debating and conversing come together to listen and learn together.”
Virtually all of the events were well-attended—in fact, some had book-lovers waiting around the block, while the panel “Triumph of the City” overflowed into an adjoining room with a live feed.
Conversations spilled onto the street as people filed out. “I think the point about hip-hop transcending blackness is really accurate; you can see rappers such as Eminem and Pitbull as popular figures,” one woman said after leaving the event “Black Culture: Music and More.” Her friend nodded in agreement, before pointing out that they were going to be late to the event on graphic novels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Michael S. Dukakis predicted a win for President Obama next week and broke down key issues at stake in the upcoming election in a talk on Thursday.
“I think the president is going to win, but this is a very, very tight race,” said the former Mass. governor and 1988 presidential candidate.
In a lecture co-sponsored by the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations and the Institue of Politics, Dukakis laid out the stakes of the upcoming presidential election by examining the differences between Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney in two main areas: health care and foreign policy.
Dukakis said that, in his first term, President Obama managed to accomplish something that none of his predecessors were able to do—instituting a nation-wide healthcare plan.
“Truman tried it; Nixon tried it; Clinton tried it; Obama did it,” he said.
Dukakis told the audience that he is opposed to the Medicare changes that Romney and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan have proposed, There is no need to turn Medicare into a voucher system, he said, because the program itself is not the problem.
"This is a cost problem,” Dukakis said.
Dukakis added that funding problems could be solved without having to overhaul Medicare, noting that the existing structure “is actually a lot more efficient than the private system.”
Instead of making changes to Medicare that could leave millions of Americans without health insurance, Dukakis recommended that the United States regulate the cost of health care and follow the example of countries like Japan, Germany, and Canada.
“The market does not work in health care,” Dukakis said. “If the market doesn’t work, then you’ve got to regulate it.”
Dukakis said that he is also “very concerned” by the course of American foreign policy.
“The notion that the U.S. is the world’s policeman is badly flawed. We’re not doing it very well, and in any event we can’t afford it,” he said.
According to Dukakis, the U.S. would be better off if it focused on building the credibiliy of international court systems and providing support for global peace-keeping institutions—a task that he does not believe Romney can effectively carry out.“Romney is out of his element when it comes to foreign policy,” Dukakis said.
Audience member Andrew J. Pan ’15 said that he enjoyed the emphasis on foreign policy and appreciated that the lecture “didn’t turn into a crazed debate on domestic issues.”
Susan J. Pharr, a professor of Japanese politics and Director of the Program on U.S.-Japan relations, wrote in an email to The Crimson that she hoped the event would inspire young voters.
“I hope that it helps get them out to vote next week,” she wrote. “I also hope it will lead at least some of them to seriously consider public service as a career.”
As he closed his speech, Dukakis impressed upon audience members the significance of the upcoming election.
“[This election is all about choosing the president] who will create a future that all of us can feel good about,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His Congressional logbook lists it as an official state visit, but when U.S. Senator Scott Brown arrived at the Elks Lodge in West Roxbury early on a Friday night in January he was just one of the guys.
He shook hands. He had a beer. He cracked a smile again and again, and leaned back as he talked with party goers gathered to welcome home Massachusetts State Senator Mike Rush.
Rush had just completed an eight-month tour of duty in Iraq with the U.S. Navy. A year after leaving Beacon Hill for Capitol Hill, Brown wanted to be on hand to celebrate his fellow servicemen and former State Senate colleague’s homecoming.
Nevermind that Rush was a Democrat or that Election Day was 11 months away, the self-proclaimed People’s Senator was not going to miss it.
“Scott Brown came early and stayed late,” remembers Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, a former Boston City Councillor, who was at the event that night. “He actually enjoys going to those events. A lot of people in politics don’t.”
More than just enjoyment, former politicians and political science professors say, events like these give Brown a platform to exercise what has become a winning political combination: independent politics and relatability.
Brown’s success rising through local, state, and ultimately federal politics in an overwhelming Democratic state has largely hinged on this confluence of personality and politics, they say.
“The sense that many voters have is that he is like them,” said Boston College political science professor Dennis Hale. “Not born rich, not born lucky. He worked hard to make his way in the world and was a success.”
The formula worked for Brown in January 2010 when his barn coat and moderate stances helped the state senator emerge suddenly to upset Democratic Attorney General Martha M. Coakley. Just two short years later, Brown’s success against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren next Tuesday may well depend on how believable that formula is this time around.
A SENATOR JUST LIKE YOU
When his S.U.V. slowed to a stop in front of Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers in Harvard Square one afternoon in late April, Brown looked as if he could have been any other businessman grabbing a quick bite on his lunch break. He wore a shirt, a tie, and a smile, but no jacket.
“What’ll you have?” someone yelled, after Brown was ushered to a seat at the bar.
The Senator smiled. He ordered a themed burger bearing his name, and talked with the fry cook at the grill in front of him. Between bites, french fry in hand, Brown explained that he had been a Bartley’s regular for years. He said that he discovered the joint and the adjacent Hong Kong Restaurant while an undergraduate at Tufts University in nearby Medford.
Brown has an everyman quality rare in politicians, those familiar with the race say. In advertisements, he often sports a Bruins jersey and focuses on his active home life. On the campaign trail he prefers talking with voters about their lives to answering questions from reporters. Brown has been endorsed by retired athletes like former Celtics star Bob Cousy and women’s advocates like Laurie Myers.
“[To voters,] he is like the boy next door, like the guy I could have a beer with—the guy I can trust,” said former Massachusetts Treasurer Joseph D. Malone ’78, a Republican who sought statewide office several times during his career.
Many politicos, particularly those on the left, are skeptical of Brown’s political posturing. But, regardless of oft-criticized campaign imagery, Hale said Brown’s appeal is convincing.
“The truck, the barn coat, all that stuff—those are props, but he is in a lot of ways an ordinary businessman, a lawyer, normal type guy,” said Hale, who has watched the campaign closely and predicts that Brown will win. “He’s not a member of an elite profession.”
Raised by his divorced mother, Brown’s childhood was spent moving from home to home and was marred by physical and sexual abuse. Though he rose out of his troubled family life, becoming a star basketball player at Wakefield High School in suburban Boston and receiving a scholarship to Tufts, the experience shaped many of Brown’s stances on women’s issues, which are more progressive than those of his party.
“I’ve been fighting since I was six years old to protect women’s rights,” Brown said in a debate on Oct. 10. While a student at Tufts, Brown joined the Army ROTC, an affiliation he has maintained throughout his subsequent career in law and then politics. Though he has never seen active duty, Brown was promoted to colonel earlier this year shortly after transferring to the Maryland National Guard. Brown now sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
After graduating from Tufts in 1981, Brown earned a law degree at Boston College Law School and subsequently worked as a real estate lawyer. In 1993, Brown was elected assessor of Wrentham, Mass., changing the course of his career and providing his first foray into politics.
Two years later he was elected to the town’s Board of Selectmen, and then in 1998 he made the jump to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Brown served in the Massachusetts Senate from 2004 until he upended the state, winning the seat of longtime Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 in the winter of 2010.
POLITICAL INDEPENDENT
Standing next to Democratic State Rep. Christopher G. Fallon in Malden, Mass. two months before Election Day, Scott Brown looked confident. Fallon, a Democrat and longtime colleague of Brown, had just become the first sitting Democrat to endorse Brown, and the senator was showing off his independent streak.
“Out of...anyone in the United States Senate right now, I’m the second-most bi-partisan senator,” Brown said.
He was citing a Congressional Quarterly study that showed he had only voted with his party 53 percent of the time during his first year in the Senate.
The figure is one of the Brown campaign’s favorite numbers to tout on the trail, and it highlights his willingness to work across the aisle—a tendency that political experts say is the product of years spent in the Democratic-dominated Massachusetts Legislature where liberals far outnumber those on the right.
“There’s not much opportunity in the Massachusetts Legislature to get anything done if you vote strictly with Republicans because there are so few of them,” Hale said.
When he was elected to the State Senate, Brown was one of six Republicans in the 40-member body.
The rising Republican proved himself willing to work with Democrats, particularly on issues affecting veterans. The latter group occupied much of Brown’s time while in the legislature as he fought for increased benefits for active soldiers and veterans. He often cites his work on a “Welcome Home” bill, which gave veterans a $1000 bonus upon their return from overseas, as one of his proudest achievements in state government.
Also of particular interest for Brown during his time on Beacon Hill was legislation toughening penalties for sexual abuse of minors and increasing funding for the Metropolitan Council For Educational Opportunity, commonly called METCO, which provides educational options for poor students in urban neighborhoods.
But political experts familiar with his time in the legislature say Brown was not always a friend to Democrats. He more often than not voted with Republicans on fiscal and social issues—by some accounts up to 90 percent of the time on tax-related measures—and was generally supportive of Republican Governor Mitt Romney.
That split has carried over into Brown’s time in Congress. Critics have pointed out that on high-profile issues, the Republican senator votes with his party up to 70 percent of the time.
Brown voted with Republicans in support of the controversial Keystone oil pipeline and refused to endorse any Democratic budget proposal. He also parted with Democratic colleagues to vote against the DREAM Act and for an extension of Bush-era tax cuts.
For all the bipartisan promises he made during his 2010 campaign, Brown also promised to vote against President Barack Obama’s health care reform bill, a promise he upheld in voting for its repeal.
Brown’s own legislative projects during his brief term were modest and often apolitical. He introduced the Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge Act to end insider trading in the House and Senate earlier this year. As he did during his time in the State Senate, Brown also worked to introduce veterans legislation. In addition to the Armed Services Committee, Brown sits on the Homeland Security Committee, and Veteran’s Affairs Committee.
“He’s probably not the best Republican vote in the Senate, but he is a Republican vote,” Hale said.
BACK TO THE TRAIL
As he has toured the state picking up endorsements from Democratic politicians in anticipation of the election, Brown has played up his bipartisanship and played down his Republican ties. He has repeatedly dodged questions on the campaign trail about his former colleague Romney, whose campaign shares management with Brown’s.
Instead, Brown has embraced Obama time and again, including footage of the Democratic president in advertisements and plugging anecdotes about their work together into debates and speeches.
Brown’s only tweet during the Oct. 16 presidential debate tied the senator to the president.
“Proud to have worked with Pres Obama on Hire a Hero to promote Veterans’ jobs and get an invite to the White House for bill signing,” it read.
In debates, Brown has consistently highlighted his progressive stances on women’s issues and education funding. Brown is pro-choice and has disagreed with Republicans over their proposals for across the board federal budget cuts.
Warren has not been shy to snap back, pointing out inconsistencies between Brown’s campaign statements and his voting record on women’s issues, tax policy, and energy policy.
Democrats have used ads in an attempt to tie Brown to his party—a strategy political analysts say could be effective and will likely be necessary to defeat the popular senator.
“The problem he has is now he has a record. And the record has two parts of it: the bipartisan part and partisan part,” said Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman. Promises that worked in 2010 against Coakley do not hold up in the face of legislative evidence, he added.
But Brown is a smart campaigner. Even after Warren’s success in the polls and Brown’s attacks on her character, Brown’s favorability ratings have remained high at 54 percent, according to a recent Boston Globe poll. In other words, political experts say, he has been able to keep himself largely above the partisan and personal fight he has picked with Warren.
Brown plans to spend his final days on the campaign trail touring the state by bus.
He will begin in his childhood hometown of Wakefield and end the weekend-long trip back in Wrentham, his current home and the city where he launched his career as a citizen legislator years ago. He will shift away from attack ads, Brown’s campaign says, as the Senator tried one last time to convince voters he puts “people over party.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard sustained a small deficit of $4.5 million in the last fiscal year resulting from a three percent increase in University operating costs, according to the annual University Financial Report released Friday morning.
The report, which describes Harvard’s financial position and goals, also includes letters from several University leaders, many of which detail the broad University initiatives, such as the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching and MIT and Harvard’s joint virtual learning venture EdX.
The deficit of the last fiscal year, which ended on Jun. 30, 2012, is larger than the $109,000 deficit of FY2011. The increase is partially due to a five percent increase in compensation costs, which account for roughly half of the total University operating expenses. Overall, the $4.5 million figure represents just slightly more than .1 percent of the total annual revenues, which last year climbed to $4 billion to meet increasing costs.
“Adjusting to and planning for new and sustained financial realities will be a significant priority for the entire University leadership team,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in her letter in the report.
To support increasing costs, the endowment payout rate rose from 5.3 percent to 5.5 percent—the upper limit of the University’s target range for this rate, which refers to the proportion of the endowment that is distributed to fund University operations.
Citing the 2008 global financial crisis, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Daniel S. Shore and Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 wrote that the University has experienced a “more turbulent second chapter” of the past decade as the endowment fell and non-endowment sources of revenue such as tuition and research sponsorship increased only slightly. But over the past fiscal year, Harvard managed to trim down its total accrued debt, from $6.3 billion to $6 billion.
“We have spent the last several years pursuing opportunities to be more efficient and effective without compromising our ability to fulfill our teaching and research mission,” Shore and Rothenberg wrote.
The report also looked ahead to the University’s future aspirations. In her letter, Faust mentioned “new directions and new capacities” and University-wide projects such as HILT, EdX, and Allston development. “Sustaining momentum in all these areas will be a high priority in the months to come,” Faust wrote.
Shore and Rothenberg expanded on Faust’s laundry list, including three focus areas for the future: reducing redundancies in programs such as Harvard University IT to increase efficiency, evaluating employee benefits to balance University responsibilities with its budget, and developing plans for a capital campaign to grow Harvard.
“Success will require a tolerance for ambiguity, an openness to different ways of doing things, a commitment to experimentation, an underlying confidence in our ability to implement a sustainable economics model, and abiding passion for the University and its impact in the world,” Shore and Rothenberg wrote.
The report also includes a letter from Harvard Management Company CEO Jane L. Mendillo, who discussed this year’s 0.05 percent drop in the endowment, which was valued at $30.7 billion on Jun. 30. HMC, which manages the University’s endowment, released a report in Sept. announcing the dip. However, Mendillo noted that for the third year in row, endowment returns remained higher than the policy portfolio—a set of benchmarks for each asset class—which Mendillo described as “beating the markets.”
“The markets during the last year continued to be choppy and highly sensitive to unresolved macroeconomic headwinds,” Mendillo wrote. “In this context we are pleased that the endowment held steady and was able to provide substantial support to the University.”

When people think of philanthropy, often large monetary donations from J.P. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie come to mind. But philanthropy can include everything from the promotion of American art to support for education, said panelists at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics on Thursday.
The panel, entitled “Does Philanthropy Make a Difference?,” featured a diverse range of perspectives on the role of non-profit and corporate foundations in fighting poverty, hunger, and other social problems.
“There are opportunities for philanthropy to be a catalyst to actually see innovation,” said panelist Mimi Corcoran, director of the Special Fund for Poverty Alleviation at the Open Society Foundations.
Coming from a corporate background, former president of the Walmart Foundation Margaret A. McKenna discussed the potential for large corporations to get involved in philanthropy. McKenna said there is a unique space within this field where for-profit companies can make a difference through investments and other projects.
In order to maximize the impact of their organizations, the panelists emphasized the importance of evaluating philanthropic endeavors to determine which projects function most effectively, something attendee Allison E. Kroner appreciated.
“People often don’t get together and talk about giving this frankly,” said Kroner, who works at the anti-poverty organization Boston Rising.
Alexandra F. Edelstein, an attendee who also works at Boston Rising, said organizations need to be willing to divest when they discover that a particular project is unsuccessful, as businesses do.
“For that to transfer into philanthropy would be really important, and that’s what they were talking about,” Edelstein said.
McKenna said that she was eager to demonstrate to college students the importance of getting involved in philanthropic projects.
“There are a lot of us in my generation who grew up in the 60s and who believed in changing the world, and we’re all getting old,” McKenna said after the event. “I think one of our main goals ought to be to encourage and mentor young people to take our place.”

Spanning everything from a step dancing demonstration to a discussion of the treatment of Pakistan’s transgender community, students presented their interests and passions during the launch event of Harvard Speaks on Thursday.
The event, hosted by a newly established public speaking organization, provided a forum for students to share their experiences outside the classroom through the spoken word.
Harvard Speaks was founded by Meredith C. Baker ’13-’14 and Eliza L. Malkin ’13 this fall.
After Baker enrolled in Expos 40: Public Speaking Practicum and had the opportunity to speak about her experiences in front of her classmates, Baker and Malkin decided to create “a platform for all Harvard students” to do the same.
Both Baker and Malkin said they aim to promote the value of public speaking through this organization. “All great causes have great orators behind them,” said Baker. “Hopefully, [Harvard Speaks] will cause people to think about how they want to express their ideas, and how to convey that with words.”
Along with its mission of promoting public speaking, philanthropy is at the core of Harvard Speaks’ mission. Each student speaker chooses a charity to endorse; often, these charities are in some way related to speeches given by the participants. As an organization, Harvard Speaks supports Team Rubicon, a disaster relief group that utilizes the skills of military veterans to provide disaster response teams.
Marjorie E. Zohn, an Expos 40 teaching assistant, said that Harvard Speaks is a great opportunity for students prepare for life after Harvard. “It becomes increasingly problematic to advance in one’s career if you are not a practiced public speaker,” she said. “Training this early is the best thing they could do.”
Every student speech is recorded and uploaded on the organization’s YouTube channel for the Harvard community. The group will hold two more events this semester before expanding to monthly sessions in the Spring. Students can nominate a fellow undergraduate or themselves to speak.
“At a place like this, you realize age is not a limit and people–before they came here, during their time here, and after–are already doing incredible things,” Baker said. “Part of the reason you come here is because of the incredible people you meet, and this is a venue to get to know them better.”
Malkin also emphasized the importance of giving Harvard undergraduates a voice. “We have some incredible professors, and we do get incredible speakers–and they’re not to be overlooked by any means–but there are also undergraduates doing absolutely phenomenal things,” she said.
“I think it just speaks to the fact that everyone has a story worth listening to,” Baker added.

Sporting an authentic Texas cowboy hat, bolo, and silver-buckled belt, Zack W. Guzman ’14 recited tongue twisters with focus. Despite his tonsillitis, he was prepared to play the part of auctioneer at the Leverett House auction on Thursday evening.
“This is pretty serious,” Leverett House Master Howard Georgi said.
“The accent will get more southern as we progress, so put those numbers high up in the air where I can see them,” Guzman said to kick off the auction. The event gave students in Leverett an opportunity to sell products or services to their peers, with all proceedings going toward HoCo and the Nokor Tep Foundation of Cambodia.
Over the course of the evening, Guzman and his co-MC Zachary N. Bernstein ’13 auctioned items from a $500 value MCAT preparation course to a date with a saxophone-playing senior to quality time with Bandit and Rosie, dogs owned by the Leverett House Masters. In addition to the live auction, the Leverett House Committee-sponsored event also featured a silent auction and a Chinese auction-raffle.
According to HoCo co-chair Paul P. Stavropoulos ’13, the House Committee began planning this auction about six weeks ago with three goals in mind: to help local businesses, to promote House spirit, and to raise money for the foundation.
Stavropoulos said that featuring the products of local shops in the auction benefits the businesses by drawing the attention of potential student customers.
“The local businesses that aren’t chains were really generous and gave us donations on the spot,” Gary D. Carlson ’13, the other committee co-chair said.
Stavropoulos said that HoCo also hopes its auction festivities will promote House spirit beyond the routine events they coordinate on a weekly and monthly basis.
“It’s a really awesome thing that we try to do to unite the house during first semester,” he said.
The Nokor Tep Foundation, which will receive twenty percent of the auction’s profits, is a cause close to HoCo’s heart because committee member Moni Anne Trac ’13’s family was instrumental in the founding of the charity. While working for the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in Cambodia, Trac’s mother became aware of the lack of adequate medical treatment for women in her country. Trac’s parents and grandmother banded together to create the Foundation, which provides care at a recently-constructed women’s hospital in Cambodia.
“I’m very happy and very proud that Lev was able to do this to help out,” Trac said.
Before Bernstein and Guzman—“Zach and Zack,” as they were called—began the live auction, Leverett residents wandered the dining hall to examine items for bid in the silent auction. The sales ranged from belly-dancing lessons to a student-administered massage to seven personalized love poems “delivered in a fun fashion, one a day, start day delivery buyer’s choice,” according to the listing. A resident dean even offered a free thesis proofreading, which many seniors said they hoped to capitalize on. Bernstein said he was inspired to help out by co-hosting this year’s auction after he auctioned off a serenading last year.
“Be loud, be friendly, and try to get people going, that’s the goal,” Bernstein said
Although there was significant competition over time with the masters’ and tutors’ pets, the date-bidding drew the most spectators to the auction. Two sets of double dates and four individual dates were auctioned off in a close battle between bidders. Tunc C. Kiymaz ’13 made a grand entrance with a shirtless saxophone solo, fulfilling the high hopes of the spectators.
“I’m so excited to see how the date auction goes,” HoCo member Kelly A. Flaherty ’15 had said just before the event kicked off. “It should be great.”

Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds told an audience of students on Thursday that College administrators are nowhere near allowing students to participate in the Administrative Board’s decision-making process.
“We have some pieces of the ways in which students could be involved and adjudicate in certain kinds of issues, but we don’t have the full picture,” said Hammonds, who spoke as a moderator at a Harvard College Governance panel organized by the Undergraduate Council.
Currently, a body of 30 administrators and faculty members hear student disciplinary cases. But in 2009, a small committee charged with reforming Harvard’s disciplinary board recommended further discussion of the possibility of creating a second alternative board—composed of adminstrators, faculty, and student members—that accused students could opt into.
These discussions have yet to begin, but Hammonds said administrators are in the preliminary stages of researching what she said would be an “incredibly complicated” transition.
“When that suggestion was first made, I said, ‘We really have to understand how that would work and how it works in practice at other institutions,’” Hammonds said. “I still don’t have a complete picture of that, nor what benefits it would bring to us. I think it just needs a lot more research and study.”
Lowell House Master Diana L. Eck, a panelist at the event, voiced skepticism about creating an additional student-populated board.
“I certainly would object to having two different bodies—that you could go to this one or that one,” said Eck, who is also a professor of comparative religion. “That introduces an element into the various procedures that I think is probably not really fair, actually.”
Eck added that she thinks the task of adjudicating disciplinary cases is too great a burden to place on students.
“This would be an enormous responsibility that I don’t think the University has any business asking of students—it’s too time-consuming, because the Ad Board will spend literally hours and hours and hours on a single student case,” Eck said.
The participation of students in the Ad Board process was among a variety of issues addressed at the event on Thursday. The afternoon discussion featured four Harvard administrators: Eck; Lars P. K. Madsen, senior special assistant to University President Drew G. Faust; Susan L. Lively, secretary of the faculty; and David R. Friedrich, interim associate dean of student life. UC president Danny P. Bicknell ’13 also sat on the panel.
Hammonds said that the primary goal of the meeting was to address student confusion surrounding the governance of the College, particularly among student representatives who serve on Harvard’s administrative and faculty committees. Hammonds said there is often “a disconnect” between the representatives who serve on these committees and the student body they represent.
“Here we thought we had a robust system of student representation, and what we found was that we had one that wasn’t working the way either side felt it should work,” Hammonds said.
The meeting also featured questions that ranged in topic from the reasoning behind the current freshman housing system, to Harvard’s investment in fossil fuels, to the state of the mental health conversation on campus.
Following the panel, Bicknell and UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 introduced two new UC websites: “Navigate Harvard”—a site with flowcharts designed to help students find names and contact information for administrators—and “We the Crimson”—a forum meant to allow Harvard students to submit and receive peer feedback on their ideas for campus change.

Bioengineer Christina D. Smolke presented her research on developing genetically encoded technologies that would advance cell-based therapies for diseases like cancer, brain tumors, and leukemia, at the Neekeyfar Lecture on Science and Mathematics on Thursday.
Hosted by the Student Advisory Board for Science and the FAS Division of Science, the Neekeyfar Lecture Series invites preeminent scientists and mathematicians at the cutting edge of research to speak in an effort to encourage undergraduate interest in the sciences.
Looking at the field of synthetic biology, “the distinctions between science fiction and nonfiction are blurred,” said Mark A. Martinez ’14 during the introduction to the event. “[It] stretches the boundaries of what seems to be possible.”
Smolke, an Associate Professor in the Bioengineering Department at Stanford, emphasized synthetic biology’s potential to harness natural capabilities as a manufacturing platform and manipulate them for human purposes, which would minimize the gap between fabrication and design capabilities.
“The development of foundational molecular tools is a really critical area for biotechnology, and it’s something that synthetic biology is trying to address,” Smolke said. “These tools are really important in being able to scale the complexity of systems that we can engineer, study, manipulate, and probe and also in the efficiency and robustness with which we can do it.”
In her work, Smolke drew an analogy to the 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage, in which the scientists are shrunk down to an atomic level and use zap guns to remove a blood clot. “While shrink ray technology has not caught on, intelligent therapies do move through the body, localize to the size of disease, and treat the disease in a specific and effective way,” Smolke said.
Smolke said that in the same way that the Mars Rover has a system of sensors, actuators, and circuitry, a cell is capable of information processing, computation, and control functions.
Although its current application is limited, Smolke said that synthetic biology could be used to produce larger quantities of morphine than are currently available through poppy flowers, which naturally produce the drug at an extremely low rate.
While organic synthesis is not measurably better than purifying the product from the natural host, synthetic biology can transfer the pathway for the production of the chemical compound into yeast by replicating the DNA that determines the pathway, grow the yeast, and then analyze the yeast’s product. This strategy could then be used to create this product in significantly higher quantities.
After the lecture, Libby S. Felts ’14 said that the lecture provided the opportunity to learn about a specialized topic that students do not typically explore.
“The point of the Neekeyfar is to help foster the interdisciplinary nature of science to get people collaborating in all the science departments instead of just specializing in one,” said Felts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than thirty students gathered at Ticknor Lounge Thursday evening for “Boxers, Briefs, or Neither?”—a discussion on masculinity and its expression and perception at Harvard.
At the event, which was co-sponsored by the Harvard Women’s Center, the Black Men’s Forum, and the Asian American Brotherhood, students addressed gender stereotypes, “manly” behavior, and the binary between “male” and “female” categories.
Interns at the Harvard College Women’s Center said that the office rarely hosts events that attract such a diverse group of students. A majority of the audience at Thursday’s event were members of the Black Men’s Forum or the Asian American Brotherhood.
“It was definitely a reach for us to organize this event,” Women’s Center intern Bex H. Kwan ’14 said. “It’s rare that we have this type of audience, so it was really refreshing.”
“This is an important conversation for the community to have,” said Chesley R. Ekelem ’16, who said that issues surrounding gender have become more obvious to her since she started attending Harvard. “I realized that [ideas of] gender and masculinity are present among so many groups on campus, so it’s essential to talk about something at the forefront of students’ minds.”
During the conversation, students spoke about their personal experiences with masculinity and gender identity. Many said that the concept of labels—male, female, gay, lesbian, transgender, and others—create unnecessary expectations and perceptions of individuals, many of whom do not fit neatly into these particular identities.
“People always used to ask me, ‘Why are you standing like a man? Close your legs,’” Lindiwe-Claudia Rennert ’14, an intern at the Women’s Center, said to start the conversation. “I’m not inviting anyone anywhere. I’m just comfortable this way.”
Students discussed the particular idea that men, when upset or angry, are expected to resort to alcohol and aggression. But Kasey A. Leblanc ’15 said that this is largely due to the way men are treated in society.
“Women are normally comforted when they’re upset, but not many people sympathize with men. No one hugs them or tells them it’s going to be okay,” she said.
Students were also shown a clip from the Disney movie “Mulan,” where the characters sing a song called “I’ll Make a Man Out of You.” Rennert, who listed all the adjectives mentioned—including “swift,” “strong,” and “forceful”—said the song implied that women could not have any of these traits.
In response to the video clip, Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15 said that traits people normally attribute to men or to women do not apply only to people who identify with those genders.
He added that many of the traits deemed “masculine” are qualities that he feels his mother has. “But the fact that she’s able to be this way shows that it really depends on the person and the culture,” he said.
At the end of the event, students were asked to write something they had learned on a piece of paper shaped like a necktie.
One student wrote: “Men have feelings too! It’s not all about muscles and beer.”
“Don’t just hold the door open for women, hold the door open for everyone,” Malik L. Knox ’13 said at the end of the event. “Don’t interact with people based on labels. Treat people the same.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday’s election could shape the future of a number of issues affecting Harvard students. We asked the candidates for Massachusetts’ junior U.S. Senate seat and Massachusetts Fifth Congressional District seat to share how they would approach five important student-related issues if elected. Their responses are printed in full below.
The Questions: 
1. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 percent nationally in September, reaching its lowest point in four years. But college graduates still face one of the most difficult job markets in decades. If elected, what concrete proposals would you support to create jobs and help get young people back to work?
2. With university endowments stagnant and the cost of higher education on the rise, would you support measures to increase funding for federal financial aid in the form of either grants or low-interest loans?
3. If elected to Congress, you will likely have to make difficult decisions to address the growing federal deficit. In this situation, what would be the most important programs to protect, and how would you approach federal research funding?
4. Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the costs of healthcare in this country continue to rise at a potentially crippling pace. What is your view of the ACA and what would you do to further health care reform in this country?
5. While President Barack Obama’s executive order announced this summer has given breathing room to millions of college students brought here illegally as children, it is not a permanent solution. Do you support the DREAM Act, and if not, how do you propose reforming the country’s immigration policy?
Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren's Responses:
1. It’s clear we need to take action to make sure our college graduates have access to jobs, so young people aren’t struggling to make ends meet and facing crushing student loan debt.
We have both a short-term jobs problem and a long-term jobs problem. Right now, we need to put people to work. Without a job and a paycheck, people can’t spend money, and that hurts businesses and depresses the economy. In the longer term, we need to invest in our future to create the conditions for our people to prosper and our economy to grow. That means investing in infrastructure, education, and research.
Jumpstarting the economy right now and creating the conditions for future growth will help make sure businesses can succeed and young people can find good jobs.
2. Yes, I support keeping interest rates low and making sure that students have access to Pell Grants and other financial aid so they can pay for college. This is ultimately about our priorities. We should not be giving subsidies to oil companies and tax breaks to billionaires, while students are taking on more and more debt. I grew up in an America that invested in its kids. I went to a commuter college where I paid $50 a semester in tuition. Today, students across the country have more than $1 trillion total in student loan debt. We need to make investing in education a priority again, so that everyone who wants to can afford to go to college. This will help strengthen our economy and make sure all our young people have a real shot at success.
3. This is a question about values, and what kind of a future we want to build. We need a balanced approach to reducing the deficit that includes both spending cuts and additional revenues. Scott Brown and I both submitted our economic proposals to the Boston Globe, and independent analysis found that my proposals were 67 percent more effective at reducing the debt. I oppose cutting programs like Medicare and Social Security, which are critical for so many Americans. We need to protect and strengthen those programs. We also need to prioritize investments in education, infrastructure, and research—the pipeline of ideas that helps businesses grow and succeed. I believe that by asking those at the top to pay a fair share and making the right cuts in spending, such as ending tax breaks to big oil, we can close the deficit and build a better future.
4. The Affordable Care Act has helped ensure that millions of children, seniors, and families can get access to high quality, affordable health care, and fair treatment from insurance companies. It has let kids stay on their parents insurance until age 26, helped seniors pay for prescription drugs, and ensured that women can get preventive services like mammograms at no cost. I’m committed to protecting President Obama’s health care reform law, which is already making a difference for so many people here in the Commonwealth and across the country. We should not refight the health care battles of the past, we should work to make health care reform more effective and move on to other urgent challenges we face.
Now we need to focus on slowing the growth of health care costs. About half of all families in bankruptcy are there in the aftermath of a serious medical problem, and millions more are under enormous financial pressure when a loved one is ill. Massachusetts has been a leader in developing innovative ways to improve quality while reducing costs, and we are a leader in medical research that can lead to breakthroughs that save both lives and costs. We must do more to lead the way to a more affordable and higher quality system.
5. I support the DREAM Act, and President Obama’s efforts to help young people who have lived in the United States for years to have a shot at the American Dream. Even though it is a fair and bipartisan bill, Republican Scott Brown has opposed the DREAM Act.
Throughout our history, America’s diversity has made us stronger, more innovative, and more creative. That’s why I support common sense, comprehensive immigration reform. I believe we need reform that is true to the rule of law, to our tradition as a nation of immigrants, and to our need to invest in the future.
U.S. Senator Scott Brown's Responses:
According to studies by the Kaufmann Foundation, new start-up businesses are the source of all the net job growth in the country over the past 20 years. Scott Brown has a record of working across the aisle to boost the MA innovation economy, and he will work with either President Obama or a President Romney on policies that will create a stronger economy for all Americans.
For recent college graduates, one of the biggest policies he will continue to work on is innovation and entrepreneurship. Many recent graduates today are interested in raising funds to launch their own start-up business. Senator Brown was invited to the White House for the signing of his crowdfunding bill, which will allow entrepreneurs­­­—such as student entrepreneurs at the Cambridge Innovation Center—to raise up to $1 million per year in equity financing over the internet. The crowdfunding bill is currently in the final rulemaking phase at the SEC.
In addition to implementing the crowdfunding bill next year, Sen. Brown is a co-sponsor of the START-UP 2.0 bill, which will give visas to entrepreneurs from other countries who want to start a business in America and students with an M.A. degree or PhD. Additionally, Start-UP 2.0 streamlines regulations, provides a capital gains exemption for investments in start-ups that are held longer than 5 years. The final provision would provide accelerated commercialization of university-based research. Promising students in STEM fields would have access to more business opportunities and connections with angel investors.
With her massive tax hikes, Elizabeth Warren would destroy jobs and make a bad economy even worse. She supports the largest tax hike in this country since World War II to the tune of $3.4 trillion dollars. According to economists at Ernst and Young, Elizabeth Warren’s policies of sharply higher taxes on the small businesses will destroy at least 700,000 jobs across the country, including more than 17,000 here in Massachusetts.
2. Yes—Senator Brown will continue to advocate for more federal support to defray the costs of higher education such as subsidized student loans and grants, but it’s also critical that colleges and universities get their costs under control, so that deficit spending by the federal government is not simply padding the bank accounts of overpaid university administrations. Administrative costs, such as Elizabeth Warren’s Harvard salary of $350,000 for teaching one class, have been accelerating faster than any other form of university spending and have become a major driver of tuition increases. Additionally, Warren receives a zero interest loan from Harvard while she runs a lucrative corporate law practice out of her office, meaning that Harvard students have been going deep into debt to subsidize the lifestyle of a millionaire law professor. Today’s students are drowning in debt, and excessive salaries like Professor Warren’s a big reason why.
3. While all forms of government spending must be scrutinized for waste, fraud and abuse, cutting federal research funding isn’t the answer to our budget problems. Senator Brown has worked with other members of the Massachusetts delegation, writing letters urging the protection of NIH research funding and will continue to be an advocate for it. Before cutting research, we need to address wasteful spending on agriculture subsidies, fraud in our healthcare and defense budget, and freezing federal salaries and benefits before we look to try to reduce research spending.
But with our national debt soaring past $16 trillion and rising, we need to get a handle on out-of-control government spending immediately, and that is why Senator Brown supports a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution that would force the federal government to spend only as much money as it takes in each year. Our national debt is a moral and economic outrage, and we cannot just pass it on to future generations. It threatens the fiscal solvency of our nation, and if we don’t act soon, we risk going down the path of Greece and other European nations that find themselves on the verge of falling off a fiscal cliff. Professor Warren opposes a Balanced Budget Amendment, and has even called it a “trick.” This is a big difference between the candidates.
4. We know now that the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable. With 18 new taxes, and higher costs for families and businesses, it needs to be replaced with simple, cost-efficient incentives to encourage states to expand coverage in a way that is best for their state. The bill will destroy jobs for recent college grads in promising Massachusetts industries in such as the medical device industry, which is getting slammed in the bill with a massive new excise tax. The bill is making healthcare more expensive for Americans rather than less—by as much as 30 percent according to former Obama economic advisor Jonathan Gruber. The Washington Post and other news outlets have reported that college students who used to be able to access affordable plans for a couple hundred dollars per semester are seeing premium increases of more than $1,000, because of all the government mandates in the federal bill. Elizabeth Warren supports the national health care law, even though it will destroy jobs in Massachusetts—a state that had already achieved 98 percent coverage. She has said she would like to go even further and implement a radical, single-payer, European health care system that would lead to rationing. As a state senator, Scott Brown voted for the 2006 Massachusetts health care reform law, and believes that health care is an issue that should be decided at the state level.
5. Senator Brown is a strong supporter of improving our legal immigration process. He believes that because of the extraordinary sacrifices involved, young people who have volunteered for military service to our nation should have the opportunity to pursue American citizenship. He does not support the current DREAM Act, because the bill rewards too many people who willfully broke the law, putting those families in front of immigrant families who are doing the right thing, following the law, and waiting years to get legal status in America. Without major reforms to improve our immigration system, the DREAM Act makes illegal immigration by parents much more attractive than legal immigration. Elizabeth Warren supports giving taxpayer-funded benefits, such as in-state tuition rate and driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants, and she opposes the Secure Communities program, which allows law enforcement officials to simply check the immigration status of those who commit violent crimes.
Consulting Actuary Tom Tierney's Responses:
1. I’m running on a four-point platform. Three of those elements, a solution to health care (see Question 4 below), increasing taxes (see Question 3 below), and restricted job guarantees for the long term unemployed will greatly enhance job creation. The last one [no further cuts in Social Security’s benefit structure] will also, in a smaller way, affect the noted enhancement.
2. Read my answer to Question No. 3 below and then return. And beware of any candidate who says he/she supports “measures to increase funding” and then tap dances around the requisite funding question.  President Obama’s [strategy of] borrow-what-you-need-from-the-Feds and pay it back via a percentage of your employment income for a number of years deserves further consideration.
3. Reducing the federal deficit calls for a two-phase attack—increasing revenues and cutting expenditures.  At the moment my focus is on increasing revenues. More specifically, I’m currently campaigning (and am the only Republican challenger in the USA so doing) to allow all of the Bush-Obama temporary tax cuts to expire this coming year-end.  Once that’s done (and that for me is the easy part) the more difficult task of my sifting through thousands of budget expenditures will begin.
4. I’m a keep-and-fix guy which means Obamacare, in my expert opinion [as a practicing actuary], is a mess but it should be amended and not repealed outright. And here’s my proposed replacement:
For people ages 65 and over: Give them traditional Medicare as it currently exists and insist that there be no benefit cutbacks.
For people under age 65: Give everyone of them and/or their employers the option to buy into ages 65 and over traditional medicare; sit back and watch the stampede as small businesses and local governments rush to sign up their employees.
For low income people at all ages: Give them traditional Medicaid (called MassHealth in Massachusetts) as a supplement.
5. I support the DREAM Act.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard cheerleaders, I wrote you a song:
You better work out,
You might as well cry,
Get ready for a rout
I’m telling you why
Col-um-bi-a is coming to town!
Yes, prepare yourselves my pom-pom bearing friends—tomorrow Harvard gets its turn to experience every Ivy football team’s favorite week of the season. It plans to celebrate by scoring many, many points, which in turn means that you will be doing many, many pushups.
Columbia football hasn’t had a winning season since 1996, when one in ten Americans had internet access, the Macarena was a No. 1 hit, and Anthony Davis was three years old. It gets worse when you consider the team's history against Harvard.  The Crimson is 41 games over .500 all-time against the Lions and has  won the last eight meetings by an average of three touchdowns. So to call Columbia a doormat would be an insult to front porches, to call it a bottom-dweller would be disrespectful to deep-sea fishermen everywhere. Instead, let’s put it this way: the Lions are to Ivy League football what “Star Wars VII” will be to George Lucas’ career—something that in the future we’re all going to wish we had never witnessed.
Granted, Columbia is coming off a rare victory after they barely inched by fellow trainwreck Yale, despite the fact that the Bulldogs were forced to start a running back (Tyler Varga) and spell him with a wide receiver (Henry Furman) under center because its top three quarterbacks were hurt. And the game STILL came down to the last minute, largely thanks to the Lions allowing Varga to collect 220 yards on the ground. But a win’s a win, right?
Here’s what Columbia first-year coach Pete Mangurian—who looks about as qualified for his job as E was when he became Vince’s manager on Entourage—had to say about Varga following the game:
“Man, is he good. He’s a good football player. I’ve seen a few good football players, and he’s a good one.”
Did everyone get his central thesis there?
A few things, Coach: It’s not so much that Varga’s good—he can’t be that special, considering he couldn’t even win the starting halfback job over an athlete named Mordecai—but rather that your team is just bad. As a general word of advice, when a team’s quarterback is actually a running back, there’s a pretty good chance he’s going to be running the ball. You probably should’ve realized this after Yale called runs on 11 of its first 13 plays, and maybe even started to sense a trend there. Because in case you were unaware, there are things you can do to prepare for the run—stacking the box, for example—so that a team that LITERALLY CANNOT THROW THE BALL is not able to pick up 257 yards on the ground. But that’s just a suggestion. Of course, it’s very possible that you did try such a strategy but your team did not execute, which would not be surprising at all, considering the fact that on a roster of 93 players, you’ve only seen “a few” good ones.
But it’s not just you, Coach; many of your predecessors have found it as difficult to win at Columbia as it is for Nicholas Cage to turn down a role in an action movie. The Lions are 27-80 over the past decade, and the program’s last (and only) Ivy championship came way back in 1961—and it was a co-title, split with Harvard. Since then, everyone else has won at least three.
But here’s the question: Why? There’s simply no reason the Lions should be to Ancient Eight football what France was to the World Wars. Because guess what, Columbia? Your campus is in New York City! Recruiting for you should be as easy as 3.14159265359 (get it?), but instead your search for talent has gone about as successfully as it did on American Idol the year Taylor Hicks won.
On the whole, Columbia’s epic failure as a program makes no sense whatsoever. In the 51 years since the Lions last won an Ivy football title, Dartmouth has won 16. Dartmouth! Do you understand how difficult it must be to convince talented athletes to spend four years in Hanover, New Hampshire? I spent four hours there last weekend and was just about ready to pull an Andy Dufrense and do whatever was necessary to get myself out.
In fact, I bet LeBron wishes he had originally played in Hanover, because nobody would have ever blamed him for leaving. Had Columbus landed there, he would have just turned back. If Hanover had seceded during the Civil War, the internet would've been invented in the 1860s just so people could make memes using Lincoln’s ensuing “I ain’t even mad” face. Had Jack Shephard lived in Hanover, Lost would’ve never existed, because he would have never tried to get off the island. The city is as unappealing as sexual protection is to Antonio Cromartie. Even Joe Biden would have refused to grow up there.
Are you getting all this? Do I need to get into the ritualized vomiting to make clear just how terrible a place Dartmouth is?
Therefore, you can’t tell me that rounding up the Big Green’s best recruits over all those years, blasting some Sinatra and saying “You can live in the greatest city in the world, or you can live in a state that can’t even beat out Iowa on the presidential calendar” wouldn’t have worked. By the way, you can use similar logic with regard to Ithaca, Princeton, and New Haven. Recruiting-wise, there is no conceivable reason why your program should have failed this badly for this long. Of course, it doesn’t help that your main campus is closer to New Jersey than it is to your football stadium, but that’s a whole other story.
Columbia, I could go on (and really, I could), but you presumably get the point—you can do better. For now,  however, things are going about as well for you as Donald Trump’s presidential blackmail attempt went for him.
So, in conclusion, let me restate my core argument, in case I haven’t been 100 percent clear.
Man, are the Lions bad. They’re a bad football team. I’ve seen a few bad football teams, and they’re a bad one.
YALE AT BROWN
The Bulldogs just lost to all of the above, which tells you everything you need to know about them.
The Bears, like Yale, are more beat-up than the illusion of Tyler Durden, as their top five running backs are all injured. But having no running backs is still better than having running backs playing quarterback, right?
Pick: Brown 31, Yale 13
DARTMOUTH AT CORNELL
The Big Red pulled the upset over Princeton last weekend, reopening the Ivy race. The Jeff Mathews-Luke Tasker combination continues to be one of the best the Ancient Eight has seen as a very long time. Mathews is second in the country in passing yards per game (he had 525 last week), while Tasker is second in the nation in receiving yards per contest (he had 210 against the Tigers, while Grant “don’t forget about me” Gellatly—who ranks 13th nationally in yards per game—had 215).
Meanwhile, the Dartmouth defense did a respectable job containing the Crimson, but its offense struggled throughout most of the game and both Alex Park and Dominick Pierre aren’t fully healthy. I can’t see the Big Green going into Ithaca, where Cornell hasn’t lost this season, and outgunning the real Big Red machine.
Pick: Cornell 35, Dartmouth 20
PENN AT PRINCETON
Simply put, a huge game. Remarkably, Penn still controls its own destiny, despite being below .500, struggling all season, and (worst of all) losing to Yale.
Now, it travels to Princeton, whose fans will be pumped not only because of the importance of the contest but because of the nature of the rivalry.
The Quakers had a big win over Brown last week, but the Tigers are too good and have come too far to fall apart now. So if Penn can pull a second straight upset here, I’ll be more impressed than Ron Burgundy was when Baxter pooped in the refrigerator and ate a whole wheel of cheese.
Pick: Princeton 27, Penn 14
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
Let’s just say Gary Johnson has a better chance of winning the election Tuesday than the Lions do of winning this game.
It’s a statistical mismatch on so many levels. As one example, the Lions have given up the seventh-most sacks per game in the country, while Harvard leads the nation in sacks per contest.
So yeah, good luck with that, Sean Brackett. I’ll tell Mt. Auburn Hospital to keep a bed on reserve.
Pick: Harvard 42, Columbia 0

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a conference where every game can make or break a championship, the Harvard football team (6-1, 3-1 Ivy) is looking to build off its win last week when it welcomes Columbia (2-5, 1-3) on Saturday afternoon.
After it dropped a fourth-quarter heartbreaker to Princeton two weeks ago, many people counted the Crimson out of Ivy League contention.
With four games left to play, the Tigers controlled its own fate in regards to the Ancient Eight title.
But last weekend, Cornell kicked a 23-yard field goal with seconds left to play, handing Princeton its first loss of the season and shaking up the Ivy League standings.
“Quite honestly [the Big Red’s victory] was pretty unexpected,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It would be disingenuous if I said it didn’t energize an already hugely energized team.”
The Crimson intends to take advantage of the unlikely second chance. Harvard’s offense—ranked fourth overall in the FCS—will look to senior quarterback Colton Chapple to continue to dominate the passing game.
Chapple is ranked No. 1 in the Ivy League for passing efficiency and second in total offense.
“He plays his best when it’s game time, but we can’t take it for granted,” Murphy said. “We have to continue to run a balanced offense. We have to continue to get great support from the offensive line and the skill guys.”
The Crimson will face a speedy Lions defense, including linebacker Mike Waller, who was named Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week last week, after he had six tackles and forced two fumbles.
“[Defense] is what kept them in games,” said senior running back Treavor Scales, who leads the league with 10 touchdowns. “They fly around up front, and they’ve got a couple of guys who have high motors.”
On the defensive end, Harvard is ranked first in the FCS in rushing defense but was forced to adapt after losing linebacker and captain Bobby Schneider to a broken arm during the Princeton game.
Schneider was a key player in the Crimson defense with 43 tackles this season.
“We have a great leader and a great captain in Bobby,” said senior defensive end John Lyon. “[Not having him on the field] is definitely a hit, but one thing he has done a great job with is coaching up the guys in his position and having them step up to do a good job in his stead.”
Columbia enters the contest with considerable momentum. The squad is coming off its first Ivy League win of the season, which was its first victory against Yale since 2001.
The Lions put on an offensive clinic last Saturday, racking up season highs in points and yardage, with 26 and 529 respectively.
Columbia’s 27 first downs were the most in program history since 1975.
Harvard plans to focus on shutting down the running game and pressuring Lions quarterback Sean Brackett.
“Our defense is about stopping the run first, trying to make them one handed, and getting them to throw the ball,” Lyon said. “We definitely want to make sure we keep [Brackett] contained this week, since he can do a lot of things with his feet.”
With the exception of a 33-6 loss to Princeton in September, the Lions have played  close games all season against Ancient Eight opponents.
“Dartmouth needed an 80-yard last-minute drive to beat [Columbia], and Penn squeaked out a win [against the Lions],” Murphy said. “If you think this is going to be an easy game, you’re in big trouble.”
Brackett’s 328 passing yards against the Bulldogs last weekend allowed him to surpass Buffalo Bills quarterback—and former Crimson star—Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05  in all-time total offense, moving him into eighth place on the Ivy League career list.
Brackett completed 70 percent of his passes and threw for two touchdowns, adding a third rushing.
After being tied at the half in last year’s matchup with the Lions, Harvard went on to score 28 unanswered points to win the contest, 35-21. Despite holding a 54-14-1 record in the all-time matchup, Crimson players say that Columbia will not go down easy.
“[Last year] we were—on paper—a much more successful team than they were, and it was hard,” Murphy said. “They may not be as complete of a team as us, but they are good enough to beat you if you don’t take care of the football.”
Harvard currently sits atop the Ivy League standings with Princeton and Penn, but Harvard players say that being back in the hunt doesn’t change the way they are preparing for the game.
“Each and every week I think we have a championship-minded attack when we step out onto the field,” Scales said. “We’re not promised tomorrow, so we go out there with that same mentality every single day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a 5-0 rout of first-time opponent Bentley last Saturday, the stakes are a little higher for the Crimson this week as it prepares to host two of its oldest rivals.
No. 13 Harvard (1-0-0) will kick off ECAC conference play Friday evening against Brown before facing off against Yale on Saturday. The home games at the Bright Hockey Center will add new chapters to hockey rivalries that date back to 1898 and 1900, respectively.
“I think that [for] any of these old rivalry games, the kids really get excited,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
The Bears (1-1-0) were ranked dead last out of the twelve conference teams in both the ECAC coaches’ and media preseason polls this year, but Donato is not one to underestimate a team that defeated Princeton, 2-1, last Friday and gave Harvard trouble in a preseason scrimmage two weeks ago.
“[Brown has] great team speed up front. They’re off to a good start,” Donato said. “They were excellent [in the scrimmage].”
“It’s going to be a tougher challenge,” junior goaltender Raphael Girard added. “[Brown] played well over our expectations.”
On Friday evening, Girard will be wary of Bear defender and Toronto Maple Leafs sixth-round draft pick Dennis Robertson. Forward Massimo Lamacchia will also challenge the Crimson’s defense.
“[Robertson] has a pretty good shot,” Girard said. “He’s not playing like [Harvard captain] Danny Biega, but [he] could score like Danny Biega. He’s got just as good of a shot, so he’s one to look out for.”
Harvard went 1-0-1 against the Bears during the 2011-12 season. Last year, the Crimson was in a position similar to Brown’s as the ECAC’s lowest-ranked team in the preseason poll. After a surprising season that included a run to the ECAC tournament finals, Harvard polled third in this year’s preseason rankings behind Union and Cornell.
Saturday evening’s meeting with Yale (1-0-1) represents a rematch of last year’s ECAC quarterfinal series in which the Crimson rallied from a first-game deficit to defeat the Bulldogs in three games. Yale polled fifth in the ECAC preseason rankings and will look to crack the national rankings with a win over Harvard. Last weekend, the Bulldogs tied Dartmouth, 2-2, before defeating Princeton, 3-2.
“Yale is a high-tempo, skilled team. They can be very dangerous offensively,” Donato said. “Last year, I think they were a little bit up-and-down but a very dangerous team at the end. [In the ECAC playoffs], we were able to take advantage of the fact that we were at home and that we got it to Game 3 and that they had played the weekend before.”
Yale must contend with the departure of All-American defenseman Brian O’Neill, but the Bulldogs still possess plenty of firepower on offense. Senior forward Andrew Miller led Ivy League skaters in assists last season, and classmate Antoine Laganiere also presents a potent scoring threat.
This season, the Crimson has been bolstered by the addition of the ECAC’s top-rated freshman class. Freshman forward and Nashville Predators third-round draft pick Jimmy Vesey had two goals and an assist in his collegiate debut Saturday.
“The freshmen impress me very much,” Girard said. “This year we’ve got a lot more depth than we’ve had in previous years.”
In the crease versus Bentley, Girard picked up right where he had left off from last year’s breakout season, turning away 31 shots to post the first shutout of his collegiate career. Donato hopes that Harvard’s skaters will provide a little more net support this weekend.
“We’re excited about the way we played offensively; [we] created some good chances, but we gave up far too many chances to think that consistently we’ll be able to have success,” Donato said. “Hopefully, we’ll be a little bit better defensively and still create the same amount offensively.”
Biega, who tallied two assists versus Bentley, is expected to command the blueline in his final year with Crimson, but the ECAC player of the year runner-up and Carolina Hurricane third-round draft pick will receive plenty of support from junior Dan Ford and sophomore Patrick McNally. Biega ranked second among NCAA defenders in scoring last year with 1.03 points per game.
Donato is approaching these first ECAC tests with end-of-season objectives in mind.
“Both teams, I think, have goals of winning the league [or] at least getting home ice in the first round of the playoffs, so it’ll be a good challenge,” Donato said.
Girard looks forward to this challenge as the Crimson hopes to pick up its first points in the league standings.
“We’ve really got to make sure we’re on top of everything right now,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off two dominating road performances last weekend, the No. 6 Harvard women’s hockey team (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) looks to capitalize on its strong start to the season, when it takes on two more conference opponents this weekend.
On Friday night, the Crimson will travel to Providence to take on Brown (1-1-0, 1-1-0). Harvard will then step onto the ice against Yale (1-3-0, 1-1) in its second road contest of the weekend.
The Crimson outscored its opponents 11-1 last weekend thanks to strong performances on both ends of the ice.
The team’s weekend sweep led to Harvard moving up three spots in the national rankings.
“We were really happy with the way we played last weekend,” co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy said. “We played really well defensively.  Offensively, we kind of had an explosion too.  We just want to keep it going.”
Bellamy recorded 30 saves in the team’s 2-0 victory over the Bobcats last Friday night, and the senior is tied for second all-time among Crimson goalies in career shutouts.
The following evening, the team displayed its offensive firepower in its 9-1 routing of the Tigers.
Junior forward Lyndsey Fry recorded a hat trick on an evening when Harvard dominated possession of the puck, recording 49 shots on net to Princeton’s 17.
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey nabbed ECAC Player of the Week honors for her play on the weekend.  The forward tallied six points in the Crimson’s first road stint, registering three assists and two goals in the game against the Tigers and also recorded a power-play goal against Quinnipiac.
But Harvard has not let its immediate success affect its work ethic or mentality on the ice.
“The biggest thing for us this year is going to be going into every game working hard, being resilient, and having confidence that we can win against anyone,” Dempsey said.
The team has been hard at work in practice this week preparing for its upcoming road contests—even Hurricane Sandy couldn’t keep the Crimson from hitting the ice for practice on Monday.
“When classes were canceled and everything else was pretty much shut down, we still had practice,” Dempsey said. “We showed up to the rink and had a great skate. That’s the kind of mindset our team has: working hard no matter what.”
Bellamy said a key to success in the weekend’s first matchup against the Bears will be a strong offensive presence.
“Brown has two great goalies,” Bellamy said. “We know whoever they have in the net will be a tough competitor. We’re going to have to do our best to put pucks away.”
Brown’s junior goalie Aubree Moore ended her sophomore campaign with the third-best save percentage (.938) in the country and was a finalist for the ECAC Goalie of the Year award.  Moore split time with senior Katie Jamieson, who appeared in 16 games and registered a .910 save percentage on the season.
Brown, which went 8-16-7 last year, enters its contest against Harvard having split its two matchups last weekend. The Bears defeated Colgate, 4-1, and had a solid showing against No. 2 Cornell but eventually lost 2-0.
Sophomore Sarah Robson is expected to be a key player for the Bears squad.  The forward led the team with 10 goals last season while tallying a team-high 13 conference points.  Robson picked up her first goal of the season in last weekend’s game against the Raiders.
The Crimson will also need to keep watch on an up-and-coming Yale squad.  The Bulldogs ended their 2011-2012 with a 1-27-1 overall record, but Yale (1-3-0, 1-1-0) has shown signs of being a different team this year.
The Bulldogs had a promising start to their 2012-2013 campaign with strong play against both opponents last weekend, defeating Colgate 3-0 while only narrowly losing to the Big Red, 3-2.
Freshman Kate Martini leads the Bulldogs with a team-high four points thus far this season, registering one goal and three assists in Yale’s opening games. Fellow first-years Janelle Ferrara and Jamie Haddad have also tallied two points apiece.
Though Harvard comes into this weekend’s contests full of confidence, the team is careful not to discount its opponents.
“Any day in the ECAC and where women’s hockey is now, teams can surprise you,” Dempsey said. “We can’t underestimate anyone. Everybody usually brings a little bit more when they are playing us."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s water polo team will begin play in the Northern Championships when it takes on Fordham on Saturday in Providence, R.I.
The stakes are high in the matchup, as the top four squads in the seven-team tournament will advance to the CWPA Eastern Championships beginning in two weeks. The Crimson will need to take down the Rams if it hopes to extend its season.
“I’m fully confident we’ll [advance to Eastern Championships],” junior attacker Will Roller said. “We have to beat Fordham and then we’re in the top four. Fordham’s going to come out swinging, and I’d be disappointed if they weren’t. But we have guys coming back from injuries, we have a serious motivation coming off a number of losses, and our focus is really clear.”
Harvard (13-15, 4-2 CWPA) and Fordham (6-18, 2-4) faced off earlier this year when the Rams traveled to Blodgett Pool on Sept. 22. The Crimson held the lead for most of the game, eventually winning by a score of 12-7.
But Roller said Harvard will have to do a better job of taking advantage of scoring opportunities and playing more consistent defense to achieve a secure, clean victory.
“Going back to the tape…there were probably 30 opportunities to score that we did not capitalize on,” Roller said. “Five goals is a great spread to win by, but I think there’s a very large opportunity for improvement…. Truthfully if we were doing everything right, [Fordham] should not have scored some of [its goals].”
After winning only one of its first 13 games, the Rams have appeared to right the sinking ship in the latter stages of their season. After its 1-12 start to the season, Fordham has won five of its last 11 matches.
The Rams’ defense is highlighted by sophomore goalkeeper Noah LeBeau, who set a school record with his 21 saves in a recent 11-8 loss to Mercyhurst. A very young team, more than half of Fordham’s roster slots are filled by freshmen—putting them in situation similar to the Crimson.
“I think they’re a better team now than they were [when we last played],” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “They have a lot of freshmen on their team too, and those freshmen grow as the year goes on. I think we’re going to have to play our best game to keep it close and give ourselves an opportunity to win at the end.”
The Crimson squad boasts a sizeable group of seven rookies, and the freshmen have had a significant impact on the team; the Crimson’s three leading scorers, Ben Zepfel, Blake Lee, and Noah Harrison, are all first-years.
Harvard freshmen have excelled in all parts of the game as Lee ranks first on the team in assists, and the four leaders in steals have all been freshmen, with Lee, Harrison, Zepfel, and Robbie Fluegge accounting for more than half of the team total.
“[The freshmen] have really done a great job of producing,” Minnis said. “I knew coming in that we had a very talented freshman class and that they were going to show that in the pool. They’ve gone above expectations, though, [with] the way they assimilated into the system right away and have stayed productive all year. I’m very excited for the future of this program.”
Though the freshmen have excelled individually, the Crimson has had its fair share of up and down stretches this season. Immediately following a nine-game winning streak in September, Harvard experienced a nine-match losing streak that lasted for much of the next month. Many of these losses came in California against nationally ranked schools.
“If you want to be one of the better teams in our conference, you have to learn what it takes to get there every possession in a game,” Minnis said. “I think that’s what we learned playing against these top teams. We bring back the core nucleus of this team next year, so I think it’s been a great learning experience for them playing against that top talent.”
If the Crimson comes out on top against Fordham, it will play the winner of St. Francis and Connecticut College later on Saturday. Top-seeded Brown will take on either Iona or MIT in the other semifinal match.
Harvard is approaching the climax of its schedule, and a win against the Rams will add at least a few more games to the Crimson season.
“This is our goal. This has been our goal the entire season,” Roller said. “Now the opportunity’s there, and I think everyone on the team is ready to seize it. I’m fully confident in our ability to do it.”

November 3, 1933: New Bombing Stirs Peace and Quiet of Soldiers Field, Angers Coaches---Apted Will Investigate
For the second time this week Harvard coaches have been the victims of bombing outrages at Soldiers Field. Last night when Coach Eddie Bradford stepped on the self-starter of his automobile, a loud crash burst on the stillness of the Cambridge evening. The whole rear-end of his Ford rose in the air and clouds of smoke enveloped the car: then a series of staccato machine-gun blasts; then silence.
Football breeds courage: where lesser men would have fled Bradford merely sat in his car, waiting for something else to happen. Then from the locker room a sound, very much like loud laughter, caused him to glare in that direction for a moment, then start his car again and drive very quickly from the field.
October 31, 1960: Officials Investigate Gastric Upsets
Officials are investigating the epidemic of vomiting that hit approximately 100 freshmen Friday night and Saturday morning. The Sanitary Inspector to the University Health Services, John C. Morris, said he also intends to look into the epidemic of diarrhea in Adams House that occurred Thursday and yesterday.
Unlike the situation is Adams House, the more uncomfortable symptoms of the freshmen epidemic put 15 students in Stillman Infirmary Friday night. The symptoms disappeared by Saturday night, however, Morris said.
November 1, 1961: Police End Serenades by Hallowe'en Throng
Two Cambridge policemen ended the Halloween revelry of a throng of Harvard and Radcliffe students at about 9 p.m. last night, arresting one band member and apparently demoralizing the others.
The student mob, estimated at 350, had barely completed serenading Barnard and Holmes Halls, and were trying their luck at Moors when the police intervened. When asked for a statement, one of the officers said "Well they're all right here so if they go back through the Square and make trouble we'll be in holy Hell. they're all right here but . . . . etc."
One annoyed 'Cliffie in the mob was overheard to say, "What's going on? We do this about seven times a year."
Upon the removal of the band from Moors Hall steps to the cozier Cabot By-Up, and a feeble attempt at mob rallying by some off-key singers, the students dispersed. The entire festivities had lasted about twenty minutes.
November 1, 1969: Ali McGraw Plays Cliffie Again

For the hockey scrimmaging segments, the Paramount production staff plans to simulate two games in the Watson Rink, using Harvard's varsity team. Harvard players will also fill the roles of Cornell and Dartmouth opponents.
November 5, 1980: Republican Club Lights Cigars While Democrats Stay Sober
While members of the Harvard Republican Club chain-smoked panatelas at a victory dance in Quincy House last night, Democratic Club stalwarts looked glumly past unopened bottles of wine at a black-and-white television on the third floor of the Kennedy School of Government.
Ronald Reagan's student supporters, many garbed in t-shirts emblazoned with a crossed-out portrait of Karl Marx, kicked their celebration off with a high-decibel recording of "Midnight Train From Georgia."
Nathan J. Hagen '81, an Anderson supporter who "crashed" the Republican Club party, wore a swastika on his right arm, which he said "just seemed fitting for the election results."

Every four years, America gets to witness the simple pleasures of election season: Saturday Night Live's post-debate coverage; election-themed treats at the local bakery; Wolf Blitzer doing something ridiculous on CNN.
But election season also brings with it an onslaught of campaign emails requesting donations. If you're anything like the typical politically active Harvard student, your inbox is filled with emails from Team Obama and/or Team Romney asking for donations.
This writer dug through his email archives and found the Obama camp's most ridiculous requests for money from President Obama himself, Joe Biden, and even Beyoncé.
 
From: Barack Obama, August 9, 2012
Subject: Insurmountable?
Request: "The headlines are talking about how you and I got beat again by the other side in fundraising…Can you make a donation of $3 or more today?"

Request: "Jay and I will be meeting up with President Obama for an evening in NYC sometime soon…Until midnight tonight, if you pitch in $25 or whatever you can, you'll be automatically entered to be flown out to join us."

Subject: Do me a favor
Request: "Day after day, night after night, I've sat by Barack Obama's side as he made one gutsy decision after the other. I get to see firsthand what drives this man…Make a donation of $5 or more today, just 23 cents per day until November 6th."
From: Michelle Obama, October 17, 2012
Subject: Thank you

Subject: Stick with me
Request: "I don't want to lose this election. Not because of what losing would mean for me—Michelle and I will be fine no matter what happens…Please don't wait any longer. Donate $5 or more today."

Just be thankful you stopped receiving emails from John Kerry.

It's been a tough year for Harvard rankings. After tying with Princeton in this past year's most recent U.S. News and World Report, Harvard recently clocked in second in another ranking.
Despite its budding Innovation Lab, the University trailed Stanford in the amount of venture capital funding secured by alums, according to a study by CB Insights.
The study looked at funding raised by alumni of Harvard, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, U.C. Berkeley, New York University, and the University of Pennsylvania over the past five years.
Because it defined "alumni" as those who graduated or dropped out from one of these universities, Facebook gave Harvard's numbers a huge boost.
Including Facebook, Harvard's total venture capital funding is $3.8 billion, a close second to Stanford's $4.1 billion.
Without Mark E. Zuckerberg's brainchild, Harvard's total drops down to $1.8 billion, still greater than the other four university's totals, which fall between $1 and $1.3 billion.
Even without Zuckerberg, Harvard is catching up. According to the study, although Harvard's collective pool of capital is smaller than that of Stanford's, the amount of deals that Harvard alumni are making is growing at a faster rate.
And given its location next to Silicon Valley, it's really no surprise that Stanford has the startup bug.
But, with the rise of the I-Lab and these current upward trends in raising capital, we'll see if Harvard can't just beat Stanford at their own game.

At first glance, a ghost tour around Harvard Square in the midst of a budding hurricane might not scream romance. But for Rosana Gambino and Jerilyn Sawyer, these elements would set the stage for a marriage proposal over a month in the making.
Last Sunday Gambino proposed to Sawyer through a flash mob staged in front of Cambridge's Old Burying Ground.
The mob started with a single person clapping to the tune of Chris Brown's "Forever," and quickly ballooned into a half a dozen people dancing on the streets of Cambridge. The routine went off without a hitch, concluding with Gambino getting down on one knee and proposing with 'Marry Me' by Bruno Mars playing in the background.
When Gambino thought about proposing, she took into account Sawyer's love of Halloween, as well as the fact that their first date took place on a ghost tour. About a month ago Gambino reached out to Cambridge Haunts tour organizer Sam Baltrusis and told him of her plans to propose.
Baltrusis said when he received the call, he "was so excited I dropped the phone."
With the tour group on board, Gambino proceeded to enlist the help of friends, who rehearsed throughout the month of October in preparation for the special day. She rallied dancers from her school, Northeastern University, to perform, had a choreographer friend create the routine, and even invited her family to attend.
The burial ground backdrop, on a night three days before Halloween, created a spooky and haunted atmosphere. Although Hurricane Sandy provided an unexpected plot twist, Baltrusis said it added to the ambiance of the event.
"A lot of the alleged hauntings happen when it's raining," Baltrusis said. "Rain brings out the spirits."
And to top off this storybook proposal, amidst cheers from the crowd, Sawyer immediately said yes.
