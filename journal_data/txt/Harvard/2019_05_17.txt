After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Director Annie Silverstein’s first feature film takes a classic story and refurbishes it handsomely. In “Bull,” which premiered as part of the Un Certain Regard category at Cannes, Krystal (Amber Havard) and her younger sister live in a small town in Texas with their grandma, who looks after them while their mother is serving time in prison. When Kris wanders through the yard of her neighbor and tough bull-rider, Abe (Rob Morgan), she stumbles upon a key and breaks into his house. In a move to establish social credibility amongst a group of teenagers, Kris invites them all over and they purge themselves in his liquor storage, wreaking havoc throughout the house. When Abe finds her the next morning, Kris runs away. But when he calls 911 and then offers to let her off the hook from officials under the condition that she cleans up his house, it seems like Kris almost wants to follow in the footsteps of her mother: She asks the policewoman, “Can’t you just take me to juvie?”
As Kris runs errands for Abe, she learns that he’s an accomplished bull-rider. Well past his prime but also refusing to let go of his sport, Abe brings Kris to his rodeos and into the African-American cowboy community. Her curiosity about the sport grows, and what began as an obligation to remediate her crimes progressively turns into voluntary time spent together.
Silverstein successfully pulled off the stint of working with a cast of mostly with non-professional actors. Newcomer Havard has a wiser-than-her-age look in her eyes, and her film debut in “Bull” proves her acting potential. Her vapid expression is more than just a detached teenager attitude; Kris rarely shows emotion throughout the film. Though Abe’s world seems foreign for Kris, it clearly provides a better future, considering that her alternative is to hang out with drug-dealing teenagers — and even deal some drugs herself. Still, Silverstein adds elements that make it more convincing as to why Kris plays with that fire: The main drug dealer is an old friend of her mom’s, and money is really tight. Besides, teenagers are all irrational and in the process of exploring themselves, so they’re allowed some leeway to make irrational decisions, right? Havard hardly engages in conversations with others — neither of the protagonists are especially talkative, and they never explicitly discuss their relationship. Instead, the the film’s strength comes from Silverstein’s subtleness in weaving together the tried-and-true themes of coming-of-age and an “unlikely pair” formng a bond, and the few creative sparks she adds here and there. That’s not to say the film still doesn’t still follow a mostly predictable trajectory with stereotypical elements: When Abe remarks on Kris’s stubbornness, calling her “flea” (“You get flicked off, then you get back on,” Abe half-jokingly says), both the use of nicknaming as a gesture of affection and the nickname itself feel too hackneyed.
As different as their disadvantages are — Abe as an injured and aging black man in the South trying to stay in the rodeo circuit, and Kris as the impoverished daughter of an inmate mixing with druggies — Silverstein doesn’t provide much more insight into either world. She treats the racial topic with caution, never directly addressing it, and her portrayal of the black rodeo community lacks depth. However, she does stay clear of making Abe a “Magical Negro,” giving him a painkiller dependency and unrealistic attachment to bullriding. The generational difference makes it natural for Abe to serve as a parental figure for Kris — again, fulfilling a trope — but Morgan portrays the role quite convincingly. Especially outstanding in his acting are his moments of struggle, mostly in (or thinking about) the bullriding ring, a non-sustainable lifestyle he can’t seem to escape. Silverstein also stays focused on capturing Kris’s coming-of-age journey in her particularly challenging circumstances, instead of falling into an all-too-common method of scooping up a teenager from a disadvantaged background and playing up their talents until they are discovered and recognized for them.
Silverstein, who wrote the screenplay with Johnny McAllister, based “Bull” on her short film “Skunk,” which won the 2014 Cinnefondation prize at Cannes. Though some may be wary of the well-tread human-animal storyline, graceful execution, as Silverstein provides, can still result in an alluring film (such as Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre’s “The Mustang” that came out earlier this year). Silverstein predictably uses the bull as an allegory for Abe and Kris’s lives, but her careful treatment of the well-tread story still results in an interesting, albeit simplified, look into the difficulties faced by two disadvantaged Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This isn’t going to end well,” says Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) within the first few minutes of “The Dead Don’t Die,” which premiered as the opening film at Cannes. He’s not wrong — things quickly go awry in the small town of Centerville: Daylight extends into the nighttime, watches stop ticking, pets start acting strangely, the farmer’s cows and chickens go missing, and cadavers begin to move underneath their white sheets. Scientists speculate that the Earth has been slightly pulled off its axis from “polar fracking,” which has caused the mayhem, though this theory is never confirmed. What follows are feeble attempts to solve the mystery, saved only by a few civilian’s oddly extensive knowledge of zombies and how to kill them: “Kill the head,” Ronnie’s instruction, becomes the mantra of the film.
It’s obvious that “The Dead Don’t Die” is intentionally campy, though it’s often hard to tell whether Jarmusch is playing on tropes or inadvertently perpetuating them. The characters aren’t particularly complex, nor are they developed later on. Rather, each seems to represent an American archetype (whose sole purpose, it seems, is to be later eaten): There are the “urban hipsters” from Cleveland (Selena Gomez, Austin Butler, and Luka Sabbat), the conservative farmer who dons a “Keep America White Again” hat (Steve Buscemi), the local forest-dwelling pariah named Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) — and then there’s Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton), whose affinity for Japanese culture seems to be a nebulous commentary on Swinton’s controversial role as an Asian monk in “Doctor Strange.”
A self-described “zombie comedy,” the film’s juxtaposition of moments of humor and scenes of intense gore is jarring, though entertaining. After two women are eaten alive by the first reanimated zombies — a scene complete with close-ups of bloody intestines and shrieking — Ronnie drives up to the crime scene in his tiny smart car convertible (which, according to him, “fits two nicely”). Later, there’s so much macheteing and decapitating that the killing becomes humorously absurd, especially when Ronnie calmly reacts to Mallory’s resurrection and proceeds to hack her head off.
Though these fragmented scenes fail to cohere, each is entertaining on its own. “The Dead Don’t Die” boasts a star-studded cast, and often cracks self-referential jokes about the actors and the film itself: Swinton’s introductory cut is characteristically bizarre, Driver carries a Star Wars keychain, and Gomez buys a CD by Sturgill Simpson, a Grammy-award winning country artist who made a song titled “The Dead Don’t Die” for the eponymous film.
Simpson’s song comes on again and again on the radio, until the initially cheerful and likable tune becomes annoying, even to the characters in the film. “Why does this sound so familiar?” Cliff asks. “It’s the theme song,” Ronnie responds, just minutes after the intro credits rolled with the same song. Along with Ronnie’s deadpan one-liners, he’s also given the lines that clumsily inject self-awareness in the film. At other points, too, Driver hints that he knows more than Ronnie should: He repeatedly talks about the future by reiterating variations of “This is all gonna end badly.”
While Ronnie is right, and zombie-filled chaos inevitably follows, the film’s objective is unclear. News reporters and radio hosts repeatedly broadcast that the Earth’s off-kiler rotation is a direct result of polar fracking, a conclusion that politicians and officials are quick to reject. This dialogue seems to imply, at least initially, that the film is a commentary on climate change, but the discussion stops there. The zombies gravitate toward things they did when they were alive, murmuring one word that describes what they loved most — coffee, Xanax, Snapple, Snickers, Chardonnay, toys, and Wi-Fi — which could also be a thinly veiled critique of societal materialism. Ironically, the people who are the most equipped to deal with the crisis are the social outcasts in the film: Hermit Bob (who eats skinned squirrels and mushrooms and lives alone in the woods), Zelda (who the diner workers called “whack”), and three children at the juvenile detention center.
A film can very well flourish in its ambiguity, leaving its purpose completely up to interpretation; however, there are far too many political allusions to let viewers make sense of the meaning for themselves. The only factors that salvage the film from mediocrity are its cheap thrills and laughs, but they can only do so much to redeem an otherwise directionless film. It looks like Ronnie’s premonitions were true not only about the plot but also of “Dead Don’t Die” itself — it really does not end well.

Familial love is no novel theme, but in the hands of actress-turned-director Monia Chokri, it becomes the conduit to much more. Her debut film, “La Femme de mon frère” (“A Brother’s Love”), which opened the Un Certain Regard lineup at Cannes, has palpable potential: It’s subtle, funny, smart, and exquisitely illustrated. However, the film’s answer to its driving question is egregiously inconsistent with its original ambitions, which nearly outweighs the otherwise careful construction of the story.
The plot’s beauty is in its simplicity. After 35 year old Sophia (Anne-Élisabeth Bossé) successfully defends her political philosophy thesis (to a board of old white men, no less), she finds herself with $48,000 in student debt and no job prospects. — as an employment counselor tells her, “You’re overqualified for all the jobs I’ve recommended you for. And at the same time, you have no experience in any field.” While she supposedly sets out to “find herself” and “self-reflect,” she crashes with her brother, Karim (Patrick Hivon), with whom she shares an unusually close relationship. The source of their rapport — which manifests in frequent and witty repartee, childish pranks, and very specific “would you rather” hypotheticals — is largely unclear, though they do share a comically intimate relationship with their cohabiting divorced parents that provokes Karim to interject, “Can we just have a boring conversation like a normal family?” Sophia is forced to recalibrate their relationship, however, when Karim takes her to get her second abortion and falls in love with her seemingly perfect gynecologist, Éloïse (Évelyne Brochu).
What then brings the plot to life is Chokri’s aesthetic execution of the everyday. The bright, monotone colors of the hospital make it a sort of futuristic refuge, thereby reorienting popular conceptions of abortion clinics without glorifying them — after hearing that Sophia has had an abortion before, Éloïse encourages her to consider birth control. Olivier Alary’s score astutely fits each scene it accompanies and switches from classical to electronic with ease: A solo flute repeats a charmingly melancholic melody during bucolic travels, while booming house music signals the film’s many house parties. Even the disorienting perspectives — one shot captures Sophia and Karim arguing through the bottom of a glass dinner table, and another only shows Sophia’s legs that peek above the couch as she struggles to do ab exercises — are imaginative presentations of otherwise mundane moments and proof of Chokri’s keen eye for detail.
Bossé shines as Sophia, a somewhat polarizing character whose blunt candor could be seen as immature or refreshing (or both). She drinks wine out of a mug, refuses to dance at parties, and maintains a personal philosophy of self-described “joyful nihilism.” Yet Bossé succeeds in making Sophia uniquely personable and even charming as she jumps from one awkward interaction to the next, imbuing her character with a natural and quick sarcasm that unveils her intellect and charisma. She is simultaneously content with and bitter at her choice to spend 8 years of her life getting a Ph.D. — after all, according to her, “life is meaningless.” Yet it’s obvious that she wants more, as she observes Karim and Éloïse’s happiness with envy and struggles to find joy without Karim’s constant companionship.
This chasm in Sophia’s life sets up the film’s driving question: How will she find contentment? Disappointedly, Chokri chooses the easiest way out. Despite Sophia’s staunch rejection of monogamous, heterosexual relationships, she only attains happiness when she starts dating Jasmin, an enthusiastic male midwife who tears up at the mention of childbirth — suddenly, she embraces everything she once despised. At best, Chokri might have hoped to show that an element of sacrifice or compromise is a necessary element of contentment, but this ending has far deeper implications. She forgoes Sophia’s admirable, feminist individualism for a rom-com ending that neatly ties up her story in an archetypal package, and the sunlit final scenes imply that because she has this change of heart, everything else will follow. A brother’s love may not have been enough, but surely, a boyfriend’s love is.
“La Femme de mon frère” is a promising start for newcomer director Chokri, whose aesthetic direction sustains much of the film’s intrigue. What needs to follow, however, is a film that stays true to its original ambitions rather than relying on tropes — otherwise, Chokri’s obvious talent will be squandered in appealing to mainstream audiences.

“Dylda” (“Beanpole”) opens with the titular character Iya (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) standing frozen as if in a trance, her muscles unmoving except in small twitches, her eyes open but unseeing. These strange episodes are a result of the lingering effects of a concussion she suffered during the war, but they’re just one physical manifestation of her suffering. In the film, which premiered in the Un Certain Regard category at Cannes, director Kantemir Balagov conveys a beautifully painful story of two women and how disjointed their lives become after the various traumas of World War II. He doesn’t simplify their struggles — instead, his dramatic portrayal of the everyday lives of his characters reflects the physical and mental wounds they have suffered from the war.
It’s the fall of 1945 in Leningrad, right after Russia has won the war, and Iya goes through her days working as a nurse at a hospital filled with veterans. Her son, Pashka (Timofey Glazkov), brings light to her otherwise reclusive life. Iya’s fits of paralysis prove to be fatal, though, when she accidentally smothers and kills Pashka. Not long after, her best friend in combat, Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina), returns from war, and Balagov reveals that Masha is actually Pashka’s mother.
What ensues is the unfolding of two very different depictions of women coping with loss. Inspired by stories from Nobel laureate Svetlana Alexeievich’s book, “The Unwomanly Face of War,” Balagov and co-writer Alexksandr Terekhov pay attention to the grief of women through the drastically different and multifaceted personalities of Iya and Masha. Their physical differences are also remarkable — Iya, who is strikingly pale and wears an equally blank expression, lives up to her nickname “Beanpole” with her tall stature, while the much shorter and more lively Masha dons a head of red hair.
Iya and Masha’s codependency and power dynamics make for a relationship as intimate as it is toxic, and the drama is elevated by the two incredibly talented actresses. Iya can’t bring herself to confess the truth and tells Masha that Pashka died in his sleep, but also tells Masha that she can blame her for his death. Masha, who is now infertile from a wartime injury, takes that Iya “owes her a life” quite literally and becomes obsessed with having a child. At first, she delusionally dismisses the fact of her infertility, justifying her decision to have sex with a gawky young man, Sasha (Igor Shirokov), to Iya by saying, “I want a human inside me ... I want a child. To hold onto.” She repeatedly explains Iya how having a child will “heal” them, and eventually becomes convinced that Iya must have the child for her.
The fixation on healing, as hopeful as it is naive, is perpetuated from not just the female leads in the film. Masha’s case is unique in that as an expected homemaker in her era, she feels purposeless without her reproductive functions. Even though she fought in the war, she credits much of her survival to her sexual prowess. Other veterans, who have no chance of regaining what they lost in the war, are also at a loss as to how they can begin to “heal.” The most explicit case is Stepan (Konstatin Balakirev), a veteran in the hospital Iya works at who is paralyzed from the neck down. The joy he feels when his wife finds him in the hospital after believing him to be dead is short-lived — with two kids and no hope of recovering from his condition, Stepan knows he will be deadweight to the family as it faces inevitable hardships. He pleads for the hospital head, Nikolay Ivanovich (played by the almost paternal Andrey Bykov), to give him the ultimate relief of death, begging, “I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m done fighting.”
The cinematography heightens the disturbing themes of the film and the sonic details create a resonating, haunting effect. Iya’s fits of paralysis are characterized by her amplified whimpers and small, jerking muscular movements. Most of the film has a dark gloomy cover, and any appearance of colors (usually bright juxtaposing hues like green and red) is jarring and seems almost whimsical, creating a dreamlike dystopian setting. The costumes and sets are gorgeous and realistically crafted to the time period, though, reminding viewers that the horrors shown are very indicative of real struggles faced in the era. Yet amidst the somber material of the film, Balagov manages to throw in humorous twists and evoke laughter. Sasha’s boyish awkwardness makes him an easy target to poke fun at, but part of the twisted wryness is how willingly Masha keeps him around, entertaining the idea that he could be one to spend forever with.
At times, the drama seems overblown. Almost every cut contains some emotional outburst or stirring dialogue, and the scenes that would have otherwise been climatic become tossed to the side when the next gripping scene rolls around. But perhaps the way Balagov overwhelms his audience with the profuse amount of drama in “Beanpole” reflects the immensity of the task that Iya and Masha faced when they attempt to readjust after war, and the sheer impossibility of it.

Three days in, and I’m starting to accept the fact that journalists (at least at our badge level) don’t get to participate in the glitz and glam of Cannes. While the French elite join Miles Teller and Cate Blanchett for cocktails, I’m sitting in the Wi-Fi cafe typing a review with one hand and feeding myself a lukewarm kiosk focaccia with the other. Xavier Dolan did happen to attend “La Femme de mon frère” (“A Brother’s Love”) as a close friend of Monia Chokri, and his presence several rows away from me was enough to make me feel unaccomplished. Otherwise, slowly sauntering next to the line of black Mercedes en route to the red carpet with very, very tinted windows (trust me, I checked) is probably the closest I’ll get to a celebrity encounter, though I did catch a glimpse of Penelope Cruz’s dress from 100 feet away — does that count?
The press cafe is a whole world of its own. So far I’ve witnessed a woman staring motionless at a photograph of Elton John for 5 minutes straight, spotted a portable charger dedicated to a Juul, and listened as a waitress told a man he can’t have more free Pellegrino because he’s already taken too many bottles. Though it’s pretty amicable amongst the journalists — it must be the espresso running through our veins that’s bonded us — any semblance of camaraderie dissipates as soon as we’re all filed into a line trying to get into a screening: They WILL cut you in line, and they WILL curse you out in a language you can’t understand.
As for the films, there’s been a lot more decapitating and macheteing than I expected (see “The Dead’s Don’t Die” and “Hatsukoi” [“First Love”]). Luckily, many of the directors have taken a tongue-in-cheek approach to tragic comedy, which is fortuitous for a gore-sensitive viewer like myself. Right now I'm not seeing a clear standout for the Palme d'Or — though I did love "Bacurau" — but there’s still plenty of time and films for that to change.

In winter 2018, the streets of Boston looked more like rivers than roads. That year, Boston tides reached heights not recorded since 1920, overflowing the Charles River Dam and causing major coastal flooding. This unexpected deluge, caused by a massive coastal storm, was a wake-up call for the city, demanding that Boston re-evaluate its existing infrastructure.
Michael T. Wilson ’07 has spent a lot of time thinking about unexpected coastal disasters like the 2018 Boston flooding. He earned a Master's Degree of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design in 2011, and seven years before the floods, he wrote his graduate thesis on Boston’s rising sea levels. In his thesis, he called for the creation of “green infrastructure,” such as wetlands or marshes, instead of the traditional seawalls and dams that proved inadequate in 2018. Now a doctoral student at MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, he continues to promote adaptable designs as a way of confronting climate risk.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Fifteen Minutes: You’ve been described as a proponent of “soft engineering” solutions for rising sea levels in the Boston Harbor. What does that mean?
Michael Wilson: What we wanted to look at [were] alternatives to a “grey solution.” Part of that was [asking], “How do you maintain flexibility in these coastal protection investments over time without going for broke?” [Soft engineering solutions] are adaptable and some of them [can] continue to morph and change with the climate and sea-level rise. You can restore habitat, you can provide open spaces, general visual prettiness, people can connect to the harbor.
FM: What exactly is green infrastructure?
MW: Some people call it building with nature, ecosystem-based services, that sort of thing. It’s using a hybridized version of nature that has certain human performance criteria.
FM: And grey infrastructure?
MW: It usually means that it involves rock and concrete — traditional civil engineering.
FM: So, are you against sea walls?
MW: I hate ‘em! No. Not at all. They definitely have their place. You do a cost-benefit analysis. Green infrastructure is obviously a lot harder to value. Sometimes the costs are really uncertain –– we're really good at building walls, we're not great at building marshes. It’s not so much that one’s right and the other is wrong or anything like that. It’s a suite of tools that can be broadened.
FM: Your website is called climatecture.net. What is climatecture?
MW: After grad school I went to work for Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates down in New York City. It was me trying to go through my “just-out-of-grad-school” branding exercise. Climatecture is something I made up.
FM: Wait, you made it up?
MW: One or two people may have used it along the way, so I’m not, like, trademarking it. The practice is at the intersection of landscape architecture, urban planning, and climate risk. It’s an overlapping Venn diagram, and I decided “climatecture” was in the middle.
FM: Are the principles of climatecture being put into action?
MW: I would say there are a bunch of places where living shorelines and green infrastructure [are] starting to take hold. Brooklyn Bridge Park is a great example. It bounced back really well post-Sandy, and there’s some other places like that.
FM: Are people generally in favor of green infrastructure?
MW: I would say that community-level people and the general public, if they’re aware of it, greatly prefer green infrastructure. I would say a lot of engineers are for green infrastructure because it makes their job more interesting. I’m sure you'll find some crusty old civil engineers who love to pour concrete, but that’s not where the state of the field is going.
FM: What are the limits of green infrastructure? Will sea levels rise eventually?
MW: That is absolutely a potential scenario. It is much worse than where we were supposed to be already. Everybody’s acutely aware that you're operating under these conditions of what’s called deep uncertainty, which is that you don’t even know what the variables are or what their probability is or how to characterize them at all, but you still have to plan for them. That’s sort of where the green soft solutions start to shine a bit more than the grey. The grey you have a lot of past dependency and you get locked into a certain future because of the investments you put in place.
FM: What are some other considerations in developing green infrastructure?
MW: One of the biggest concerns for grey and green is that we need to be thinking about environmental justice. There are real people who have real lives at stake and disruption is more than just losing a piece of critical infrastructure… These are also political and cultural and social investment questions. They’re not just purely economic. If you’re planning on carbon-free Boston 2050, what does the future of the city look like? It’s not just, how do we protect the assets of today in the future?

I would wait in the car for my dad and my sister to return with the remains of other lives: dog-eared pulp fiction, a drum kit, and once, a prosthetic leg.
My dad and Punzie, then seven, would often trespass into abandoned buildings. Once in Kentucky, where my dad spent his adolescence, they rooted through a deceased neighbor’s collapsing house. It was here that they found the prosthetic leg, which they claimed proudly like a trophy.
In Virginia, my dad found a faulty lock on the door of a run-down, whitewashed church — an easy entrance. I sat in the grass outside, age ten, quietly splitting blades and observing ants. It wasn’t that I wasn’t curious — I was. But a nervous loop would run through my head — one of caved-in walls, tetanus, and ticks lurking in high grass — making me pick at my skin.
Crickets buzzed and the sun softly fell around me: Nothing about the scene suggested an act of breaking and entering. I had cautioned them to be careful, but I was immediately quieted by my dad’s reassurances. Once they left, I imagined myself standing guard against an approaching mob of nosy neighbors, demanding an explanation. I drafted elaborate excuses, wanting to take part in the drama without actually participating. I fell into the older sibling trope: quiet, bookish, parental. I was a collection of my countless fears and entering unknown territory would make that identity precarious. I didn’t know who I would be if I crossed the threshold into long-empty buildings — a rule-breaker, a bad kid? So I stayed put.
With a clatter, they returned, arms full of church fans printed with the faces of MLK Jr. and JFK and a snare drum. I helped them load their treasures into the car and listened as they detailed the church’s interior, its velvet carpeting and rodents nesting under the pews.
***
By age 13, as my body began to mutate and evolve, my identity loosened. It was terrifying: As I sprouted pimples and boobs, my habits began to change. Everything was in flux, so I wasn’t bound to the same things anymore. If my body could decide to change after years of sameness, so could I. Suddenly, I found myself scaling the fire escape ladder out of my window to the off-limits roof, unsure where my responsible self had fled to.
The ladder was decades old and rusted over. It clung to the side of the building; I had nowhere to fall except the neighbor’s backyard, five stories below. I’d weighed the risk and reward, and decided the roof was worth it. With each rung, I broke from my responsible identity and tested my potential for a new, daring self. From above, I could see the tops of oaks and passing cars, neighborhood babysitters with their entourages, and the nearby high school. If I squinted, I could see the Statue of Liberty. I would move across the roofs of the conjoined buildings, peeking into my neighbors’ lives. Some roofs boasted gardens of tomatoes growing alongside weed, others discarded lawn chairs and cigarette butts.
I had discovered the world of Places I Was Not Meant to Be. But with that came the question of who I was, an identity crisis of pubescent proportion.
***
When I was thirteen, my closest friend sent me a story by Philip Roth, “The Conversion of the Jews.” A middle school-aged boy named Ozzie finds himself on the roof of his synagogue, threatening to jump. The jump wouldn’t kill him, but it would cause a scene. Ozzie looks down at his worried mom, his rabbi, his friends, and asks himself: Is it me? Is it me? This was a question I found myself asking constantly, as I dared not to look down from the fire escape ladder: Is it me who climbs up the side of a building on a rusty 50-year-old ladder? In the story, a conclusion is offered by sheer action. There he is, on the roof: Suddenly, it is you. 
Being both the responsible one and the building-scaler, I found, wasn’t a choice — maybe that’s why 13-year-old me loved that story. Ozzie ends up on the roof by accident, but once he’s there, he has already become the kind of person who would end up on top of a synagogue, making a scene. Before I could decide if I was the kind of person who would climb up the side of a building, I had already done it.
My friend had sent me that story without knowing my roof-going crisis. She too had been sneaking onto the roof of her thirty-story building in the middle of Manhattan. I didn’t know about her habit until the last day of eighth grade — “our final day trapped in middle school,” we’d say, posing as angsty teenagers — when she brought me there.
As I stood on her roof, I looked down at the people below, milling, strutting, padding, iridescent in the June sun. Most, I thought, were probably sweating in the heat. Some were exiting the same train station I’d exited earlier. Then, I had been one of them; later, I’d enter the same station, rejoin the pack. I had been there, I was now here, I would be there again. I could go where I wanted, roofs and sidewalks and train stations.

On April 11, Khartoum International Airport shut down, and Ilham Abdalla Tagelsir Ali ’21 began to panic. “It was like, ‘Oh my god. What am I going to do?’” Ali says. “I go back home every long break, summer and winter. I was just like, ‘I need to see my family.’”
Khartoum International Airport, Sudan’s largest travel hub, closed that day following a military coup that overthrew the administration of president Omar al-Bashir, who had held power since 1989. In the early 2000s, the International Criminal Court indicted Bashir after news broke that he had orchestrated a genocide in Darfur that killed 200,000 citizens. Anti-government protests began in December after a period of steep economic decline and culminated in April in a still ongoing sit-in outside Sudan’s Defense Ministry.
On April 7, Ali reached out to a group chat of Sudanese students at Harvard when she heard about the increasing unrest in her home country.
“I remember just texting the group chat, ‘guys, I’m having a mini panic attack. I need any of you guys. I just need to be in your presence,’” she says.
The 14 Sudanese Harvard students have been in close contact over the past few months, communicating with each other about the instability taking hold of their country. “We all have a group chat because there’s not that many of us… it was a good support system,” says Ali.
At Harvard, Sudanese students have been overwhelmingly in favor of the protests that led to al-Bashir’s removal. “It’s been really inspiring to see the people of Sudan revolt,” says Leena A. Hamad ’21. “It is really beautiful to see them witnessing the changes that are happening, and it’s really inspirational to see people my age, students on the street, and women especially, take a stand.”
On April 13, students and other Harvard affiliates gathered on the steps of Memorial Church to demonstrate in support of a new democratic Sudanese government. Since the recent fall of al-Bashir, a military council has been the country’s ruling power and has promised to transition to a civilian government within the next two years. But Ali, unwavering in her conviction, opposes their leadership.
“I’m not on the ground,” she says. “I can’t do anything [in Sudan]. But no, we’re not taking this military government. We asked for a civilian government. We’re not compromising until our demands are met.”
This is not the first time Sudan has transitioned power through a military coup — in fact, al-Bashir first came to power in 1989 through a similar coup. “The fact that this happened 30 years ago… it makes me nervous,” Abdeljaleel I. Ismail ’21 says. “But I guess we have to trust that the transitional government will turn into a civilian government, turn into something we’re proud to have.”
Ahmad S. M. Saaid ’21 says he wasn’t surprised by the coup. Citizens started protesting in December, when the economic conditions took a downturn, causing the price of bread to triple. He remembers waiting in line for hours to pump gas last summer.
“[In December], I didn’t go protesting. No one in my family really did because it was too dangerous,” Saaid says. “But since the start of April, there’s literally been like millions of people out on the streets. My family has been out and protesting pretty much every day over the past month and that goes for everyone, including my younger siblings.”
Amidst the turmoil going on at home, Harvard’s Sudanese students are still trying to finish out this semester. The distance between home and Harvard can feel even farther.
“The amount of times I’ve thought about taking days off — it’s unreal. There’s countless meetings, work shifts that I just showed up late to, meetings that I’ve skipped, and everyone on the other end has been incredibly understanding because it’s not just me who’s going through this,” Ali says. “The pain of being far away from [a] home that’s going through such a revolutionary time, not knowing what to do when you’re so far away, worrying about your family, worrying about your friends, worrying about your people.”

Harvard University’s Arnold Arboretum makes up a mere 281 acres of the 56,000-acre urban sprawl that is Boston. The lilacs in the Rosaceae collection look beautiful in April.
Four million people live in this city. The global temperature has risen by an average of one degree Celsius since the 19th century. My feet are sore, and I wish that, for a moment, I could lean back on the bench overlooking the rose garden, close my eyes, and not be interrupted by the sporadic honking and sirens blaring from Route 203.
My feet are sore because I’ve walked the entire boundary of the Arnold Arboretum. Perhaps I should have worn better shoes, or at least given myself a better view: I envy the joggers and dog-walkers and couples strolling the winding dirt paths inside the Arboretum itself. It’s less interesting on the perimeter; stretches of suburban housing and office developments mark the scenery on the opposite side of the road.
A brutalist rectangle structure overlooks the rose garden. It’s complete with a reinforced concrete chimney — the sort of towering grey cylinder you’d expect from a factory or steel plant. This is the Department of Public Health building, placed centrally between the Bussey Brook Meadow and South Street Community Garden. The grey monolith and its smoking chimney stick up through the trees, visible from anywhere along the eastern entrance. Other traces of the city are everywhere in the Arboretum, if you look close enough: cigarette butts stuffed into woodchip pathways or commercial airplanes from Boston Logan Airport passing overhead.
When the roads are quiet and the passersby are gone, however, the trees briefly regain a sort of stillness. Without the noise pollution of the city, the forest starts to feel natural again.
***
Maybe it’s disingenuous of me to posit the Arboretum as “natural” in the first place: many of the meticulously arranged florae are accompanied by small metal tags that say “Native to Western China” or “Cultivated Origin.” It’s easy to feel immersed in nature here — especially if you can avoid the asphalt paths and their accompanying loud Bostonians — but there is a strange artificiality to the design of the Arboretum: a space so carefully planned and cultivated that it leans toward becoming simply an imitation of nature itself, the foliage aligned and sorted like cardboard cutouts in a storefront display.
However artificial the Arboretum is, looking at it through the crosshatch metal fence from the sidewalk along the perimeter at least provides the illusion of an unclaimed land, immune to the forces of urbanization that have taken over the rest of the eastern seaboard. Yet I know that only a few miles away, the Atlantic coast is eight inches higher than it was one hundred years ago. I know the air I’m breathing is filled with 41 percent more methane than 20 years before. I know the City of Boston has spread many times wider, landscaping and paving over the land that once was truly “natural.”
Whenever I refer to the latent source of my anxieties by name — climate change — my mind inevitably returns to a single image: the cliche photograph of a lone polar bear, stranded on a tiny floating iceberg, surrounded by vast stretches of open sea. As the ice melts, the water encroaches from all sides, shrinking the boundary of the floating ice. The bear is usually staring dismally at the photographer, or else pawing the water, as if watching its own reflection ripple across the tiny waves.
As I stand on the border of the concrete sidewalk and cultivated Kentucky Bluegrass near Peters Hill and look out onto South Street, the 281-acre arboretum itself begins to feel like a melting iceberg. The conservationist ideal that guides the Arnold Arboretum is admirable, but I can’t help but find the effort futile as I walk the asphalt sidewalks along the property line and hear the trucks and buses passing by. I know where the carbon emitted from their exhaust pipes will end up, and I can only imagine what that means for this small, shrinking sliver of nature that I have circumnavigated in a single morning.

When Andrea R. Flores '10 was elected as the first Latinx president of the Harvard Undergraduate Council in 2008, her lipstick posed a problem.
During the election, spectators didn’t focus on her platform’s substance. Instead, Flores recalled, they seemed more concerned with her gender and race, asking her if she had a “Latina agenda” or drawing attention to her straightened hair and eyeliner.
Flores went on to serve a successful tenure as UC President: She founded a communications committee to make the UC more accessible to students, and, in an attempt to elevate student input, she collected and consolidated student responses to Harvard’s budget cuts in 2009.
At the age of 24, she got a job in the Obama White House as a policy assistant on immigration and rural affairs. However, Flores said, the same skepticism that shrouded her UC presidency continued to follow her.
On April 17, Flores recounted these experiences at an event hosted at the Women’s Center to promote an essay collection she contributed to, entitled “Yes She Can.”
The book holds the stories of 10 young women who worked in the government during Obama’s presidency. The essays provide inspiration for the next generation of women seeking to enter public service. At the event, Flores was joined by Jenna Brayton and Eleanor Celeste, two of her co-authors and fellow Obama White House staffers.
The three women shared a variety of anecdotes and advice with the audience, ranging from serious suggestions for embarking on a political career to Celeste’s wry recollection of, post-2016 election, sharing a bottle of gin with her fellow science policy analysts at their White House desks. The unifying sentiment was clear: The White House and political realm writ-large are spaces for young women to occupy, despite the seemingly insurmountable barriers to entry and especially in the current political moment.
Flores began by discussing how her experience as UC president influenced her professional career. Since her tenure, a more inclusive, civically-engaged culture has evolved on Harvard’s campus. Although Flores left her government job two years ago for the private sector, she emphasized the importance of energizing young people to participate in politics.
After Flores’s opening remarks, one audience member asked about taking the leap of faith to pursue public service and mentioned the tradeoff between monetary gain and personal fulfillment. In response, Brayton emphasized that public service and the private sector are not mutually exclusive — in fact, she argued, the skills gained in one are easily transferable to the other.
Another audience member wanted to know about entering politics in a post-2016-election era when many people seem disillusioned with Washington. Flores answered by recounting the moments in her career when she felt the tangible, positive impact of the work she was doing.
At one point, an audience member expressed uncertainty about discerning the fine line between standing up for yourself in the workplace and jeopardizing your career. Flores passionately recounted a recent experience: a colleague at her current law firm commented on her signature red lipstick.
To this, she replied that she wears it because she “rocks it.” She explained that this quick-witted quip was one way to handle harassment privately. But, she also detailed instances in which she felt that formal measures were necessary — namely, when a male co-worker accused her of being an affirmative action hire. She filed an HR report at the firm.
After the event, FM had a chance to speak with Flores.
When asked about the culture of the Obama White House, Flores noted prejudiced misconceptions within the self-proclaimed progressive administration.
“I think sometimes there is an assumption that… all the Latinos worked on immigration and black people worked on civil rights,” she said.
However, she expressed optimism at the prospect of the “next Democratic White House, when you can make even more strides.” With greater diversity, Flores believed “there won’t be assumptions that the Latinos will now go to the immigration team.” Instead, “Latinos can be doing gender issues, or national security advising,” she said.
When asked for her advice to young women looking to enter politics, Flores emphasized the importance of not letting a sense of pride dictate career decisions. “You don’t know what the smallest job will get you,” she said. “Don’t be afraid to go back home, go to your state government.” Flores joked about her application of this humility principle, claiming that she tends to work on campaigns that lose.
After a few “self-care” years in the private sector, she says she plans to re-enter the political realm.

The Alaskan village where Wilfried J.K. Zibell ’21 grew up is called Noorvik. It sits above the Arctic Circle and is populated by fewer than one thousand inhabitants, the majority of whom are Iñupiaq, the indigenous group of the region. Noorvik is also one of the reasons that Zibell decided to learn Yiddish at Harvard.
“Coming from a village that is 98 percent native Alaskan back at home, I think the way that Yiddish has been approached from a linguistic-preservation standpoint is interesting,” Zibell explains.
“I came in as a Government concentrator, and now I’m in Comp Lit.” They laugh. “So, uh, character development!”
At Harvard, Yiddish offerings are small but comprehensive: The language’s sole preceptor is Sara Feldman, a recent arrival to the faculty, who teaches language courses as well as a Yiddish cinema class. Feldman inherited her role from a lineage of preceptors first established in 1993, with the arrival of Professor Emerita Ruth R. Wisse. Wisse was the first person to hold the title of Martin Peretz Professor of Yiddish Literature and Comparative Literature, and was a deeply influential figurehead in the development of Yiddish studies at Harvard.
Zibell began their Yiddish education with Sara Feldman’s class, Yiddish AA: Elementary Yiddish I, and Professor Saul Noam Zaritt’s clsas, Yiddish 107: The Politics of Yiddish. Zaritt holds an assistant professorship in Yiddish literature and is one of the founding editors of In geveb, a digital journal of Yiddish studies. Though he is on sabbatical this year, he can typically be found nested in his office in the Dana Palmer building, working in the dark.
But the presence of Yiddish at Harvard predates Zibell, Feldman, Zaritt, and even Wisse by a century. In 1896, Leo Wiener was hired by Harvard to teach Russian, Polish, and Old Church Slavonic, and with his appointment, the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures was born. Wiener, a Russian-Jewish polyglot and translator of Tolstoy, published the first English language history of Yiddish literature in 1899. He also collected books in Yiddish during his travels across Eastern Europe, constituting a major component of Harvard’s expansive collection of rare 19th century Yiddish literature. Today, his collection sits on the sixth floor of the Widener stacks.
Yiddish belongs to many, exists all over, and yet, as Feldman notes, “Students can’t go study abroad in a Yiddish land.” It is now considered a language of migration and marginality. Its origin is often traced back to Ashkenazi Jews in the ninth century, but it is now spoken throughout Europe and the Americas, by Ashkenazim and non-Jews, in Hasidic communities and secular counterculture. Linguistically, the language is Germanic and is written in a Hebrew alphabet, though it also contains Aramaic and elements of Slavic languages. Still, Zaritt explains that Yiddish “has a deep and troubled, or interesting and challenging, relationship with German, with Slavic languages, with its various territories, both in Eastern Europe and in its diasporas.”
In the past two decades, the way the language is taught and practiced at Harvard has changed significantly. Nationally, a vast percentage of students of Yiddish are queer-identifying and are drawn to the language for its contemporary queer culture. Zibell was also drawn to Yiddish for this reason. In Zibell’s past study of language, the question of gender-neutral pronouns was dismissed: If the language did not accommodate non-binary genders, there was little a single student could do. But, Zibell says, “with Yiddish there’s this feeling of being on the forefront of something new, almost ironically I guess.” The challenge of incorporating gender-neutral pronouns is embraced, not shied away from.
Many students are also drawn to the legacy of Yiddish in socialism. The General Jewish Labor Bund, a famed socialist party in late-19th century Russia, advocated for the use of Yiddish as a Jewish national language, and many of their songs are written in Yiddish. The political roots of Yiddish are far-reaching, from queerness to socialism — and they even find a home in contemporary heavy metal.
The jump from Government to Comparative Literature might seem stark, but Zibell, who has bleached hair and a soft Alaskan accent, reframes their relationship. “Gov is not the only way to study political reality, and maybe not the best way to study political reality at Harvard,” they explain. “The humanities can be political and should be political.”

It’s 5 p.m. on Saturday, and our hands are stinging from hot frybread grease. That’s the trouble with frybread — when you drop the rounds of dough into the pan of oil, it’s bound to splash. Bubbles pop and spray droplets onto whoever is flipping the pieces. But the whole process gets a little more complicated when we’re in the Grays common room kitchen, which is full of college students.
Every year at Visitas, Native Americans at Harvard College hosts an event called the Frybread Formal (formal attire is “highly unnecessary” — we just like the alliteration). I attended my first Frybread Formal as a prefrosh in 2017, where I met the Harvard Native community and decided that Harvard might just be the right place for me. The frybread was a little cold and rubbery then, and it will be cold and rubbery by the time we eat it tonight in Quincy, where we will welcome the Native prefrosh, tell them about Harvard, and try to convince them to enroll in the fall and join our community. I was elected co-president a week ago — Visitas is my first major responsibility as one of NAHC’s main leaders.
We choose frybread every year because it’s a quintessential Native comfort food. Many of us have recipes memorized — a pinch of this, a handful of that, a bowl of flour measured by eye.
But we also choose frybread because it’s cheap. Flour, salt, baking powder and a little hot water: knead it, shape it, throw it into a pan of melted Crisco. My co-president and our treasurer purchased the ingredients using the club credit card, with money left over from donations for a conference we hosted during my freshman fall.
We don’t spend a lot of money all at once during the rest of the year, so that’s probably why the bank deactivated our card on the Sunday afternoon of Visitas. Between food, drinks, and utensils for Saturday, a large catering order for Sunday, and supplies to decorate our activities fair booth, the bank grew suspicious, apparently. But spending the money is worth it, because a successful Visitas is imperative for NAHC. We’re a small group, and if we don’t convince enough prefrosh to join as freshmen, our numbers will dwindle. We feel like we have to convince Native prefrosh to commit to Harvard — and once that happens, we have to convince them that we are a community worth investing time in.
The weekend’s efforts begin when Native prefrosh meet their student hosts — most are hosted by NAHC members through the University Minority Recruitment Program, hand-matched by a NAHC member working at the office according to academic interests, tribal affiliations, and home states. General pool hosts (hosts who are randomly matched to potential students) are asked only to provide a floor to sleep on; we’re expected to spend the weekend with our prefrosh, take them to lunch, and be friendly and supportive all weekend. We have a great time — it’s fun to befriend the prefrosh, to hang out as a group, to eat frybread and Panera sandwiches. But for NAHC’s leadership, a sense of urgency hangs over the weekend. For many people, Visitas is like any other weekend. For cultural groups like mine, Visitas can be an exhaustive recruiting event, with stakes as high as the group’s survival.
At the formal, we ask the prefrosh if they’ve committed to Harvard. If they have, there’s a chorus of “yay!” from around the room. If they’re still deciding, we ask them what questions they have about Harvard. Which schools are you still choosing between? What’s keeping you from committing? Is there anything we can do to help?
I sometimes joke that we become a branch of the admissions department during Visitas.
***
The Frybread Formal is the first of three events that we look forward to every year. On Sunday, we meet at the river for PicNAHC, to eat boxed lunches catered from Panera. Then it’s time for the activities fair at the Student Organization Center at Hilles, where we yell information over the din to interested prefrosh.
This year, our table is on the third floor, between the Nigerian Students Association and Fuerza Latina. Both groups have more people staffing their tables than us, and both have speakers. As the fair progresses, their music gets louder; people from both groups start dancing, until the space around our table is filled with swirling bodies. The energy is exciting; we’re all trying to reach interested prefrosh, but, as the din grows, it becomes harder and harder for me to talk to prefrosh who approach NAHC.
My attention is drawn across the room, where another group is yelling. I am curious about how groups like the Harvard College Standup Comic Society (HCSUCS) — organized around a shared interest, rather than a common cultural identity — approach Visitas weekend.
HCSUCS, I learn, participates in two events during Visitas weekend. The first is the activities fair, and the second is the Visitas Stand Up Comedy Show. HCSUCS puts on shows every month, and according to their president Freddie S. Shanel ’21, they usually start preparing for shows a week in advance. Visitas planning doesn’t differ too much from normal operations.
I’m struck by their casual approach to Visitas when I talk to Jackie M. Feffer ’22, a HCSUCS member. She points to a poster she made right before the fair started. “It didn’t take that long,” she says, and laughs.
NAHC wants prefrosh to come to Harvard so they can be part of our community. When I talk to Feffer, I notice an emphasis on the extracurricular interest: “You could do stand-up anywhere,” she says. “We would want it to be at HCSUCS, but I just want to let people know it’s a fun thing to try out wherever you go.”
I had a similar conversation earlier with Ava M. Hampton ’21 and Jonathan Castillo ’21 at an information session for the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. I asked them if they talk to prefrosh about whether or not they’re committed to Harvard, something we ask in NAHC all the time. They say that HRDC generally doesn’t ask.
“We want them to be excited about theater. No matter where they end up, we want them to be involved,” Hampton says. “So we give them as much information as possible and we tell them what the Harvard theater community is like, but I hope that these people, whether or not they’re committed, will be involved in student theater wherever they are...I think it helps them to be excited about student theater more broadly.”
When she says this, I think about the other potential students I met during my own Visitas — three of us hung out for a long time over the weekend, but I was the only one who committed to Harvard. One went to Yale, and I see her sometimes at Ivy Native Council. The other went to Stanford, and I haven’t seen him since. When I reminisce with my NAHC friends about Visitas weekends past, his name still comes up. Each potential new NAHC member lost is significant.
I can’t speak to the way these interest groups approach community, and I certainly don’t fault them for so earnestly encouraging a passion for their activities. But I can’t imagine being so casual about prefrosh committing to other schools. That attitude isn’t something we can afford.
Back at the activities fair, I meet Anisha Dok ’20 and Julie Ngauv ’20, co-presidents of the Khmer Student Association. The KSA is a new cultural organization; it was founded last semester with approximately ten members and the intention to grow. KSA was one of the many co-hosts of the Pan Asian potluck.
“It was a lot of time I guess, because we had to cater,” Dok says of the effort Visitas required. “The restaurants that we wanted to cater from weren’t willing to give us food and bring it all the way to Cambridge.”
“Yeah, because it’s really hard to find Cambodian food in the area,” Ngauv adds. “So we had to go to Lowell, Massachusetts, and one of our board members had to drive the food back.”
They’re describing a logistical problem, but I know the baggage that it comes with: the mental toll of taking time out of a weekend at the end of the semester, the physical toll of traveling, the emotional toll of having to continuously display an inviting, supporting community. When I interview Cindy Gao ’21, she shares some of the same concerns. Gao is co-president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, and she says that Visitas is important to her because it strongly influences the future character of AAA.
“We start thinking about [Visitas] pretty early, because recently we have been thinking a lot about what we want our organization to be, and a lot of that is going to be determined by how we brand ourselves to the prefrosh. Because the prefrosh are going to be the future of our organization, right?” she says.
And, if community-building efforts fail, there can be long-term consequences.
I mention that I’m writing this piece to a classmate of mine, Anum Shafqat ’21, while we’re studying for a final. She perks up; it doesn’t take long for her to recount her own Visitas experience.
“When I was a prefrosh, I remember going to a [South Asian Association] event and feeling very excluded because a lot of the culture there was very cliquey,” Shafqat says. “It’s like, it’s not that you guys aren’t friendly and nice people, it’s that I feel like you have to be a certain type of person to fit in.”
“And that kind of shaped my whole SAA experience — because of how I felt during Visitas, I realized that’s not the place for me to be.”
***
The last person to stop at our activities fair table asks us what kind of support system we are. The question is par for the course. Every Visitas, we talk to prefrosh about how we are each other’s support system; how we check in every week, proofread each other’s emails, convince each other to go to office hours or to reach out to professors for help, talk through the steps of dropping classes or getting a CAMHS appointment or taking time off.
I’m practically shouting over the music as I tell them that there are things we will inevitably go through as Harvard students, and it helps to know that you have a group of friends there to help you through it, as best they can.
My voice cracks and I have to cough. When I try to finish answering their question, my voice is gone.

When Ju Yon Kim first got to college, she thought she wanted to study Shakespeare and write her senior essay on Virginia Woolf.
That changed when, during her sophomore and junior years at Yale, she began taking classes on Asian American and feminist literature.
“It was really at that point I started thinking seriously about being an academic, because I saw that there were ways to study literature that could connect up also to some of my interest in social issues,” she says. “It seemed like this wonderful combination of intellectual inquiry with a commitment also to social inquiry.”
That’s not to say that Kim — who will be the only tenure-track professor specializing in Asian American Studies following the departure of Genevieve A. Clutario next fall — thinks that Shakespeare and Woolf scholars cannot engage with social issues. But she says that these societal questions took on a new immediacy for her in light of feminist and Asian American studies.
“Unfortunately, at that time — and it's still actually an ongoing struggle, which you can read about it in the newspaper,” she adds, laughing, “but, Yale’s ethnic studies offerings were pretty limited.” During her time as an undergraduate, she joined a student group that advocated for more robust ethnic studies offerings — one that she says is similar to the Harvard Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies, which currently does comparable advocacy work — where she “learned how academic institutions worked, what it meant to be faculty.” And thus began her interest in a career in academia.
Today, as an associate professor in the humanities, Kim does not do the same sort of “banging on doors” activism she did as a student. But she does think that she participates in a different type of advocacy today. “A lot of people don't know what ethnic studies is, and you’re kind of having to represent it,” she says of her position at the University.
Obviously, she continues to remind the University that “we need more support, staff, and resources.” But she also sees “her everyday interactions” as representative of the field of ethnic studies. “I think ethnic studies is still attacked from various corners,” Kim says. “And so I think I feel a particular kind of responsibility to represent it in a very careful way, because it’s such a sensitive moment in the university.”
Her activism is in her demeanor in the classroom, the syllabi she creates, the discussions she has about the humanities and English literature in general. It is in the interview she is doing for this article right now.
***
Kim was born in Seoul and moved to California as a child. After she received her A.B. from Yale in 2002, she spent a year working for an Asian American women’s publication called Audrey Magazine. She had been contemplating graduate school since her time as an undergraduate, when a professor encouraged her to consider Stanford’s interdisciplinary Modern Thought and Literature program. After a year at Audrey, she entered this program at Stanford.
Kim says that Stanford and other schools in California have embedded ethnic studies as part of their curricula for much longer than schools on the East Coast. During her time at Stanford, she was involved in the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, where there were many other faculty members who were interested in the same sorts of questions that she was pursuing.
“And so I was able to bring together a committee of people who worked in Asian American Studies, Latinx studies, African American Studies, and develop that knowledge of ethnic studies that was really only sort of half formed in undergrad, where I really had to do a lot of things independently,” she says.
It was at Stanford where another one of Kim’s academic interests developed: performance. Kim had participated in extracurricular theater and performance groups during her time at Yale, but at Stanford, she realized “that was really where my academic interest lay.”
Kim muses about whether there is any connection between her interests in ethnic studies and theatrical performance. After a moment, she decides that there is. “It’s probably, in some ways, it’s very implicit in my mind,” she says. Performance is good at “answering certain questions about things like race, about self presentation about the complexities of identification,” because “it’s live, it’s embodied, it’s about immediate social interaction.”
For her dissertation, which eventually became her first book, Kim researched how habits and routines — things like making eye contact, handing change back — became sites of racial conflict during moments in American history like the 1992 L.A. riots. She was particularly interested in how theatrical performances dealt with these embodied actions and their implications.
After she finished grad school, Kim spent a quarter as a lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara. At UC Santa Barbara, there is an Asian American Studies department. Because Kim was one of many faculty offering classes in the field of ethnic studies, she was able to tailor her courses to more specialized topics.
After her time at Santa Barbara, Kim was offered a job in Harvard’s English Department. So she packed her bags and moved back across the country to the East Coast.
***
When Kim took her job at Harvard in 2011, she didn’t know she would be the only tenure-track Asian American Studies faculty member. “I was very surprised when I came to campus,” she says.
She began teaching her course English 181a: “Introduction to Asian American Literature” in her first year, and has offered it every year since then that she has not been on sabbatical. There were seven enrollees during its first year, including an auditor; last semester, there were more than 70. Kim notes that before she taught the class, similar courses had been offered by visiting faculty — but she believes it was her permanent position at the University that allowed it to become as popular as it is.
In 2015, Clutario became a professor in Harvard’s history department, joining Kim as a tenure-track faculty who specialized in Asian American Studies. Kim says that Clutario’s Asian American History class helped Asian American Studies course offerings take on a wider variety of subjects and perspectives at Harvard. Next fall, Clutario will be leaving Harvard to teach at Wellesley College, which has an Asian American Studies department.
“I could always sort of rely on Professor Clutario’s class to cover more of the history, for example, because she always teaches an Asian American history class. I do some of that in Asian American Literature, but I think that I might pick up a little bit more of that,” Kim says. “I think that both the class and, in some way, I will be asked to be more representative, in that I won't have a colleague to participate in that with me.”
Clutario also says that the two approaches to Asian American Studies that she and Kim offered allowed students to pick what felt most relevant to them.
Kim describes “studies” as an interdisciplinary field: It can be approached from different perspectives, based in the humanities or the social sciences or anything in between. When there is not an ethnic studies department, however, ethnic studies classes must be tailored to fit into existing departments.
In addition to the flexibility that a department would allow, there are also more concrete benefits of resources and influence.
“The only way that ethnic studies is going to thrive is if we have enough faculty members at Harvard. And the only way to have enough faculty members at various places in their careers is to make them feel that this is a place that really believes in their work,” Kim says.
“If there’s a sense that you are having to constantly explain the work that you do, if you constantly feel that there are misconceptions about your approach, then it gets really hard to believe that you have a future at this place.”
“Over the time [Kim has] been here, she has established Asian American literature as a significant field in the department and on campus generally,” says Nicholas J. Watson, chair of Harvard’s English department. “She’s not quite the only person who's done that, but she’s the main person who’s done that.”
Though Kim is glad to be able to offer the course, the fact that she is the only English professor specializing in Asian American studies means that she cannot move beyond what this course is — a survey course. “I would really love to teach a more advanced course in Asian American studies,” she says. “And I haven't been able to do so in part because I wanted to teach Intro to Asian American literature all these years.”
Kang Wook Lee ’20 took Asian American Literature last semester and is currently enrolled in another of Kim’s classes. He appreciated her inclusion of diverse voices in the syllabus, which he says is especially important considering the fact that East Asian voices have often been privileged in the history of Asian American literature.
In terms of her teaching style, Kim has grappled with how her identity interacts with her students’ notions of her.
“I’m not interested in fighting stereotypes by performing the opposite,” she says. “I know what my tendencies are, just as a person and as a teacher. How can I make those productive, despite stereotypes that might exist? So if people just are going to assume that I’m nice and approachable because” — she laughs — “I’m a woman or something, instead of trying to perform authority, to seem more intimidating or something, how can I actually use that to enhance the learning experience?”
The students I spoke with all listed Kim’s warmth, approachability, and ability to elucidate complicated concepts as central to their perception of her.
“She’s very much a technician. We're only there for an hour and 15 minutes, but we cover a lot of material and the way she discusses it, you can tell every detail was thought of,” says Esteban A. Ortiz ’20, a student in her Migrations class this semester. “But she also knows everyone's name, and you’re always just be able to say hi and strike up a conversation. She’s a very friendly, very down-to-earth professor.”
Clutario adds that when she first came to Harvard, Kim was a valuable mentor to her as the only other tenure-track Asian American studies faculty on campus, and that throughout their time at Harvard, they “worked together to grow a curriculum around Asian American Studies.”
“She has been a really wonderful mentor, because — and I think she’s like this with her students too — she’s just really generous, and really ethical. And I think it’s because she really takes to heart the tenets of ethnic studies and tries to embody that in her scholarship and her teaching,” Clutario says. “I’m going to really miss working with her next year.”
***
I ask Kim whether it has been difficult to move so far so often — from Seoul to California, and back and forth from California to New England — and whether that had influenced her decision to eventually take a job at Harvard.
She laughs, joking that the academic job market is so tough that people don’t really factor choice into job offers.
But then she continues, “I guess you’re asking a question about the past that’s really about the future in a way.”
She speaks slowly, as if she is parsing each word.
“In terms of whether or not I miss specifically the kind of support for the field that there is on the West Coast — it’s hard because I want to believe that I'm here because we’re building ethnic studies and Asian American studies here.”
“And to the extent that I can believe that, I’m glad to be here, because it feels important,” she says. “If I really felt that rather than building, it was merely about maintaining a fairly limited set of opportunities for students who are interested in ethnic studies — I think if I felt that way or if it began to feel that way I would definitely, perhaps have a different sense of my future here.”

Right before Ella J. Biehn opens her University of Georgia admissions letter on November 16, 2018, she looks down at her camera and tells her future YouTube viewers, “I just got back from a Latin Club meeting.” The camera focuses on her as she opens her online admissions decision letter, and, after her eyes quickly scan the screen, she reads it aloud: “Congratulations on your admission to University of Georgia!”
Four months later, on March 28, after opening eight other admissions letters on camera, Biehn sits at a desk and tells her viewers “it’s Ivy day.” She rests her hands together in a prayer position as she tells the camera “I’m about to get rejected three times in a row. Which is, just so you know, really hard to take.” Of the three letters she opens that day, from Harvard, Brown, and Tufts, she opens Harvard’s first. She starts shaking her head and says, “alright guys, rejected from Harvard.” She grabs her face as she tells the camera she’s rejected from Brown and Tufts too.
Between November and March, Biehn filmed herself opening 13 admissions letters from various colleges and universities and, once she opened them all, edited the video into an 11-minute compilation of all her reactions. Though Biehn has only 61 subscribers, this video — the only one on her channel — has 11,732 views.
It’s impossible to pinpoint the origin of the “college decisions reaction” genre, but the earliest of these videos available on YouTube dates back to 2011. That year, only two were uploaded. This past week alone, more than 35 were uploaded to YouTube. In some of these videos, students are surrounded by family and friends as they open the letter; in others, students open them alone. Regardless of their in-person audience, many students address their generic future YouTube viewers, explaining the intimate experiences of the college admissions process.
Biehn says her imagined audience “made it a lot more bearable to do, like, something that’s really nerve-wracking.”
“When you’re reacting for an audience, you’re performing a little bit,” she explains over Skype. Biehn confesses that she edited out portions of her reactions to rejection letters, and she also didn’t show the finished video to her family. “I don’t know if [my family] would be interested in it,” she says. “I think it’s almost made for an audience, and not for people who know me.”
Biehn, who has since committed to Wesleyan University, decided to film and post her admissions reactions because she had enjoyed watching them throughout her own college application process. “I found that it was really entertaining and also made me feel better about the whole process, to see other people going through the same thing,” she says. “I think it’s really helpful for people to see that things don’t always work out the way you think they’re going to. That’s okay, that’s just how it is. Other people are living through that reality.”
Like Biehn, John A. Kubinec started watching these videos when he was stressed about college applications during high school. When it came time for him to open his own letters, he knew he wanted to record and post a video like the ones he loved to watch.
In his video, posted this month, his reactions are subdued. He stands by his kitchen table, surrounded by his mother, his father, and, via Facetime, his brother. When he opens his Harvard letter, he picks at his mustache and calmly says, “Oh dang it, I got rejected.” Then, Princeton: “They cannot admit me to Princeton. Man, oh for three!” When he opens the last of five letters, from Cornell, he throws his hands into the air and screams “Ayyyy we got in!” His parents clap their hands over their heads and give him huge hugs. The video isn’t as overtly emotional as some — there are no tears or collapsing onto the floor — but, still, it has 43,337 views and counting. The premise of the video promises drama to the audience, and Kubinec’s four consecutive rejections deliver. But the allure of the video isn’t simply theatrics.
Over Skype, Kubinec explained that, when students look at colleges online and scroll through the Internet for admissions information, “we see five percent acceptance, ten percent acceptance. They’re just numbers to us.” On the popular websites College Confidential and Niche, the students admitted to Harvard are consolidated into one average high school GPA and acceptance rate. On Naviance, an advising website some high schools use, students can abstract themselves into a data point and place themselves on a graph — SAT score on the y-axis, GPA on the x-axis — to calculate their chances of getting accepted to a specific college. Red, green, and blue dots on the graph represent prior applicants from the same high school who were rejected, accepted, or waitlisted, respectively. Reaction videos allow anxious high schoolers to look at actual faces who have experienced the college application process, rather than simply stacking their data point against the statistics of years past.
As Abby Ohlheiser recently wrote in the Washington Post, these videos present authentic accounts of how students celebrate and grieve. They capture the reality of the College Process, like a crossover between shaky home-movie footage and a Bravo reality TV show. But, more than just presenting the reality of college admissions — the excitement of getting accepted and, more often, the banality of rejection — the personal anecdotes in these videos help many navigate the drawn-out, mysterious process.
“With schools people are generally really curious about — like Harvard, Yale, Stanford — people want to know people that get into those schools, because it’s such a small percent,” explains Hannah S. Morrison, who uploaded her own admissions reaction video this spring. This fascination with elite universities is evident in Morrison’s views. The four music-related videos previously uploaded to her channel garnered about 1,000 views each, while her reaction video, entitled “College Decision Reactions (Yale, Harvard, Georgetown, UPenn, UChicago, Princeton, etc.),” reached 155,069 views in three weeks.
Morrison explains that, to some extent, she’s surprised that her own video attracted so many views. But, as someone who endlessly watched admissions reactions throughout high school, she knew that such videos often went viral. “A lot of people in the college application process, even if they’re applying to not those schools specifically, want to know who gets in. It’s an insider thing.”
Reaction videos help dispel this myth of the “insider.” Morrison doesn’t transcend from a girl sitting in her living room to an abstract number, the 5.9 percent of applicants accepted to Yale this year. By the end of the video, she’s still the girl sitting in her living room with her parents.
Personalizing the statistics of admissions allows applicants to imagine colleges as real places populated with real students — potentially students like themselves. “[Reaction videos] were opening an almost unreachable gateway to these high level elite schools that you hear about but you don’t know much about,” says Christine Lee, a high school senior who has committed to Harvard. Throughout high school, Lee was “obsessed” with college reaction videos and videos about college life in general. As she applied to college herself, she watched reaction videos because “seeing that it was a culmination of their hard work kind of gave me the encouragement to continue with my own high school career and really strive towards getting that moment for myself.” Because of these personal clips, she could imagine herself at schools that seem to exist only on glossy brochures.
In an email, Kubinec clarified that “college admissions YouTubers are important because the college application process disproportionately favors students with good guidance counselors or parents who can afford online admissions counselors.” Through YouTube, prospective applicants don’t have to pay a professional to learn how to get into these schools — they can learn about the process from the students living through it.
That’s why Lee decided to film her own reaction video: “I wanted to make it clear to the people who followed me that I didn’t have any huge spikes — I’m not a legacy student or anything like that, I don’t really have anything particularly special about me, I just want to reassure the underclassmen and the people looking to apply to these colleges in the future that there are students like me who are low-income but work hard and aim for these schools.”
Of course, despite this increasingly popular trend, college admissions remain opaque — candidates upload some essays to the Internet and a committee of people, of an amount you will never know, whose faces you will never see, compare your essays and test scores against some unknown rubric. Consequently, for the people who personalize the process online, they become clear, visible checkpoints on the way to admissions.
“I’ve been approached by underclassmen that I’ve never seen before at my high school,” explains Lee, who opened Princeton, Yale, and Harvard acceptance letters in her video. “I’ve been getting so many DMs and comments and stuff like that from random people. The biggest request I’ve gotten is like, what are your stats, what are your extracurriculars, give me tips on the college application process.” Morrison even created a GroupMe, now with 432 members, to more efficiently share such information with her viewers. A mother commented her daughter’s high school course load on Kubinec’s video and asked if he thought the work might overwhelm her.
While college reaction videos make the college process concrete and human, the sudden credibility given to high school students online, because of their acceptances, reflects the enduring mystery of the acceptance letter. Lee feels as though she abruptly transformed from someone scrambling to get into college into an expert on college admissions. She confesses, “I’m still not really sure how to view myself and my position in this whole crazy process.”

Min Jin Lee, currently the Catherine A. and Mary C. Gellert Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute, is the author of New York Times bestseller and National Book Award finalist “Pachinko” and her debut novel, “Free Food for Millionaires.” She is currently working on the third novel in her“Koreans” trilogy, “American Hagwon,” which grapples with education as experienced by Koreans and Korean Americans. FM sat down with Lee to discuss her writing, the research processes behind her fiction, and the themes of ethnicity and diaspora she explores in her work.
FM: Why do you think you wanted to become a novelist?
MJL: I never thought I was going to be a writer until I finished being a lawyer. I quit being an attorney when I was 26. I practiced law for two years — I was very ill with a liver disease, and I thought maybe being a lawyer was not a good idea because the hours were so extreme. I thought it’d be simpler to be a writer, so I quit law and I started to write fiction. I was entirely wrong: It’s much harder to be a novelist than it is to be a lawyer, significantly harder. But I figured that out after a series of failures as a writer. I wasn’t one of those kids who [was] like, “I want to be a writer or a poet or playwright.” Those were such far-fetched ideas to me. When I was in college and high school, there were very, very few Asian American writers who were getting any kind of attention, so I wasn’t wrong to think this would be an illogical, irrational, luxurious dream.
FM: In the opening line of “Pachinko,” you write that “History has failed us, but no matter.” Your undergraduate training was in history — what do you see as the limitations of the discipline in telling the stories your work focuses on? 
MJL: Historians cannot do anything more than what their discipline requires them to do: using primary documents and artifacts to interpret what happened in the past. The problem is that many ordinary people cannot leave this evidence behind. Therefore, ordinary people are less considered by historians. Because of technology, I think we’re going to see a primary shift — now ordinary people are recording their lives in real time through social media. To me that’s an interesting thing: how will historians tackle this excessive abundance of recordings and documents? If history has failed us before, what will future historians think about the lives you and I have lived today in our public versus our private lives?
FM: You’re the first person who’s written a novel in English about Korean Japanese people. Writers, particularly underrepresented writers writing very necessary books, typically feel burdened by what some call “the ethnographic imperative.” Does it feel like a privilege or an obligation to give voice to those who have been silenced and tell the English-reading world the stories of Koreans?
MJL: All people of color, all outsiders, feel some burden of representation. That said, no one should be a writer unless you actually enjoy writing, because writing can’t be driven only by a sense of giving voice to disempowered people. No matter how high your moral high ground is, it’s impossible to show up every day and to feel as humiliated as you do, because the daily life of a writer in the public space is that you just feel like crap most of the time. If you enjoy the stories that you tell, and you enjoy the revision, the architecture of narrative, you’re incredibly fortunate.
To this idea of being the ethnic writer, or the outsider writer, or the person of color writer, I am absolutely all those things, and I don’t disavow those terms. People are going to put you in boxes, and to get upset about how people name you is a waste of time. I can’t control that — I can control only the quality of my work. I don’t really have these label issues, but that’s also because I’m older. I think it’s younger people who are giving voice to these things, and that’s their right; I think they should protest as much as they want to. Your generation is very idealistic and romantic, and that’s a good thing. Just because we can’t always practically do everything our ideals espouse doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. Especially because people like you and I have enormous privilege now: We are affiliated with institutions that are so powerful, so it is really incumbent upon us to consider the loftiest, the highest values because we are given that privilege.
FM: Do you think people need permission to write about other groups that they don’t belong to?
MJL: There’s a whole theory right now that everyone should just stay in their own lane, and if you don’t have permission to write about a community you’re not part of, then don’t do it — I don’t agree with it. However, if you’re going to write about someone’s experience that’s not your own, it’ll be much harder. If you’re going to do it well, you better be a really good artist and learn how to tell that story in your field. At the end of the day, I believe that no matter what you’re writing about, the artist has to have a very strong intellectual and emotional connection to the material, and that connection has to be authentic. Sheer competence, having a strong command of the toolkit of your art will take you far. But commitment to making it the best as you can — that’s what makes something very special.
FM: Is it important to you that your work reaches both American and Korean audiences?
MJL: In the beginning, at my events, the crowd was almost uniformly white with some Latinx and African American and South Asian folks, but in the past year, a good 10 to 15 percent are Asian Americans. Very often Asian Americans will say to me, “I’ve never been to a reading before.” And I’m like, “Wow.” But they came because they had read the book. They’re so full of love and kindness, and I’m so grateful to my Asian American readers, because it’s hard to see yourself in a book. It’s almost as if you need a mirror, but at the same time a mirror tells you who you are. I think you need to do it like you need to drink water and breathe air. But you can go a long time without it, and Asian Americans and Asians around the world have so rarely been reflected in English. Thankfully my book has had sufficiently wide distribution, so it’s possible to find my book in a bookstore, and not all Asian American writers that I know and whom I respect enormously have had that privilege.
FM: An enormous amount of research goes into each of your novels, and in the three books in your Koreans trilogy, you’ve adopted a very research-based approach to novel writing. How did you develop that, and would you ever approach fiction differently?
MJL: Well, what I do is weird. Most fiction writers would never spend as much time on research and rightfully so. You really don’t have to do it. I just like to do it because I write such big, community-based novels, and because I have so many people with different jobs in my book, and since I haven’t had that many different kinds of jobs, it’s very important to me to be accurate. When I meet somebody who knows how to fix an air conditioner, I get kind of excited because I’m like, “Oh wow, you know something that I really don’t understand!” I’m happy to follow him around as he exchanges the Freon or explains that if you add a little bit of soap to this copper coil and it starts to bubble, that means the Freon level has been altered and so on. I really get off on this stuff. And then I might use maybe one percent of it when writing. I feel like I need to know all that stuff to understand the meter of someone’s dialogue.
FM: What do you see to be the relationship between literature and politics? 
MJL: Everything about me is political, and I’m making an argument all the time. In my fiction I’m very political. It’s under all of the drama, and I let you decide what you believe. I’m not going to tell you what to believe, but I am going to present all the issues to you. My first book is really about what I think of capitalism. People think this book is about Wall Street and fashion, and I’m like, “No, it’s actually about how capitalism works.” My political arguments are in every point of view of every character, what happens to working class people, what happens to ruling class people, how human beings relate to each other in commerce — that’s all in my first book.

“Wait, so you’re Maya, not Hannah?”
My new friend stood there astonished, a vague look of betrayal on his face.
When my roommate and I met him for the first time last week, we had jokingly decided to switch names as we introduced ourselves. After he found both of us on Facebook, however, we had to clear things up.
We walked through the Cambridge streets, looking for a pizza place that would seat our group of 11. “So how come you didn’t go back to Chicago for spring break?” he asked me conversationally, a few minutes later. I laughed. “What’s left for me there? I’m out of touch with my friends; none of my family lives there.”
He frowned. “But didn’t you say you went to high school there?” We all laughed again; I forgot that along with switching my name, I had not told him that I moved from Chicago to India in 2012. As I smiled, however, something tightened within me. How had I so easily erased those six formative years of my life?
***
When I was 12 years old, my family crossed the Atlantic Ocean and returned to Mumbai, India, where my parents had grown up. There were a variety of reasons why we moved from Chicago, but perhaps most central was my parents’ reluctance to grow old in the US.
Growing up in the states, my sister and I mainly spoke English, both at school and at home, because my parents wanted us to fit in to our small, mostly Caucasian neighborhood. After moving back to India, this became a problem: While I understood Hindi and even enjoyed Bollywood movies, studying Hindi at a public school was not an option, so I went to an international school. My classmates were a privileged, sometimes spoiled group whose parents could pay to send them abroad after Grade 12. I’d never been the most diligent student in my American junior high school, but knowing that my parents were cutting into their retirement savings to educate me drove me to work hard, much to the reproach of my peers.
“You’re only smarter than us because you went to school in America,” a classmate told me once matter-of-factly.
America seemed to follow me everywhere. “Maya is a foreigner,” a boy in my class teased as my cheeks burned.
Though some of my classmates had lived in America for years, all traces of their American accents were gone. Mine didn’t go away. Perhaps it was because I spoke so frequently to my sister, or simply because I was older when I moved back. But even once I spoke Hindi fluently, I was scared to open my mouth in public because it was so obvious that I was not from India. I didn’t want shopkeepers to overcharge my family.
I didn’t believe my mother when she told me that my classmates were just jealous of me. I never quite stopped feeling the resentment directed at me — because of my birthplace, my grades, and my height, as I was the tallest in the class.
But other aspects of India were a delight. I loved to curl up with any one of the four newspapers we subscribed to, and I began to recognize concepts from my history class unfolding on their pages. I loved to cook and listen to the radio, the smell of roasting peanuts mixing with the aroma of the pounding rain. My little neighbor would stand beside me, imploring me to read a book with her.
***
I had just finished moving into my freshman dorm when I heard a knock on the door.
“Yeah?” I said tentatively.
I thought that everyone else was crowded into Annenberg with their parents. Not wanting to go alone, I had skipped dinner for the first time in my life. The door handle turned, and the suitemate who had helped me put on my ridiculously large mattress cover entered, sitting down next to me on my bed.
“My parents just left,” she said, forlorn. The summer breeze drifted through the windows, and she turned to me. “It must have been hard to move in by yourself.”
I smiled and we began, for the first of many such evenings, to talk.
The pattern continued: Every other day, she’d knock on my door, or I’d shuffle over to hers, for an evening of soul-searching or Bollywood movies.
I told her about the other six students from India, two of whom had, like me, grown up State-side and moved back to India, only to return for college.
“They’re lovely, but they feel more Indian than me. I just sound like an American,” I lamented.
“I can relate — I grew up in China,” she explained. Her journey was the inverse of my own, two-thirds of her life spent across the ocean from her roots.
In the 21st century, maybe it’s increasingly impossible for anyone to have a straightforward explanation for where they come from. We toggle between identities, pulling from a jumble of birthplaces and nationalities. When I pretended to be my American roommate Hannah, maybe it wasn’t a lie, so much as one facet of who I am.

Maria L. Hinojosa rummages around in her purse for a moment before finding a few folded sheets of lined paper. It’s a letter from Estrella, a transgender, undocumented Mexican woman currently serving eight years in a maximum security men’s prison. Hinojosa carries the letter around with her everywhere, along with a recorder for whenever Estrella calls — the last instance was at 11:30 p.m. the night prior.
“This is a story that I’m passionate about,” says Hinojosa, explaining her choice to feature Estrella in an upcoming documentary project. “Telling a story about [who] might be perceived to be the most unimportant person in our country. She’s trans, queer, formally deported, has a criminal record… yet part of what I’m trying to do is to humanize her.”
A fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, Hinojosa speaks with FM in her campus office on a Tuesday afternoon. Her embellished purple blazer and velvety black pants radiate a warm, vibrant professionalism.
Hinojosa is an award-winning journalist — she has won four Emmys for her work on everything from poverty in Alabama to her former talk show, “Maria Hinojosa: One-on-One.” Today, she anchors and produces NPR’s program Latino USA, which she says is one of the only Latina-run newsrooms in the United States. Her professional work in media began in 1985, when NPR hired her as their first Latina intern; however, she still credits her career success to her start at Columbia University’s radio station when she was an undergraduate at Barnard College.
Yet journalism wasn’t always Hinojosa’s plan. Growing up, she didn’t recall seeing any women of color represented in the news media: “Like, zero in the United States of America that I could see,” Hinojosa says. So when she landed the job at NPR, she felt that an “extraordinary amount of privilege and responsibility” accompanied being “the first.”
“I think that is what pushed me to bring my whole self into the newsroom, because I understood that I had been invisible for the entirety of my life at that point,” Hinojosa says. “I was in my early twenties — I wanted to stop the invisibility and I wanted to be a part of making sure that that invisibility stopped.”
Now, Hinojosa continues to center her career on the stories of marginalized people — people like Estrella.
“What attracts me to a story, I think, is probably humanity,” Hinojosa says. “Wanting to get the humanity of a person who I’m interviewing and also to create a sense of humanity for all of us, because none of us are going anywhere and we’ve got to figure out how to live together.”
Though Hinojosa is a journalist with purpose, she does not consider herself an activist. She explains that, despite the way she is sometimes described, as a journalist of color and “especially as a Latina, as a Mexican, as an immigrant, as a woman journalist, it’s very problematic for me to be labeled as an activist, because that takes away my credibility.”
To her, the stories she chooses to tell are just part of her job. “We’re supposed to uncover stories,” she says. “We’re supposed to talk about communities that aren’t discussed; we’re supposed to shine light there — we’re supposed to hold the powerful accountable.”
Hinojosa’s experiences in the world of journalism inspired her to found her own non-profit production company, Futuro Media Group. Its website voices a commitment to “producing ethical journalism from a POC perspective and representing the new American mainstream.” After noticing the lack of diverse voices in newsrooms, she hoped to create a space for journalists of color, who compose 79 percent of its editorial staff.
Futuro Media attempts to embody “community-based journalism,” seeking journalists outside of conventional hubs like Los Angeles and New York City. Hinojosa feels that this highlights the work of journalists in often underrepresented communities. The organization then produces audio and visual programming which is distributed by networks like NPR. Among those is her own show, “Latino USA.”
“I wanted to create a newsroom that was a majority people of color newsroom, that reflected who we are in the United States — so that’s what I did,” she says, referencing the inception of “Latino USA.”
As a professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at DePaul University, Hinojosa often meets students who feel tired of explaining themselves and their identities. While her work is dependent upon marginalized people sharing their stories, she knows from her own experience that doing so is not easy. “Not every day are you going to be able to do that kind of teaching [about identity],” she often tells her students. “Not every day are you going to feel completely optimistic.”
Still, she encourages students to continue sharing their stories nonetheless. “The only other thing that I say is, ‘What’s the alternative?’”

I feel it in the air. As I push open the door and step into the room, there is something here that isn’t always here. Is it built into the room itself? I wonder. Or is it coming from the people already in the room? I don’t know what it is — some kind of energy, maybe — but all I know is that it feels good. I feel good.
It is not the first time I am feeling this way — air light on my shoulders, warmth radiating off the bodies of friends, and a gut sense that my presence, or my humanity, is being realized. I am safe. It is a special feeling and one I find myself chasing, searching for these moments and holding on to them for as long as I can, until the necessary progression of life pulls me onward.
I have encountered this feeling in somewhat unconventional spaces: directing a porn film in an artist loft in Oakland, Calif., cheering from the audience as a woman reclaimed her sexuality in orgasm on a New York City stage, and participating in a “sex magic ritual” in a kinky mansion in the heart of New Orleans. It’s an odd list; I know.
Dealing with sex is never easy. Every Harvard student remembers, during freshman orientation, being forced to participate in a host of semi-awkward workshops hosted by organizations such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. As a senior, I have now participated in dozens of these kinds of workshops, and while many people shudder at the thought of having to talk about sex, the atmosphere these workshops cultivate is one that I have found extraordinarily valuable and, frankly, imperative.
Each workshop begins by ensuring that everyone, from the start, feels welcomed, included, and recognized. This procedure is known more formally as establishing the space as “safe,” the importance of which is a hot topic at colleges around the country. In 2016, the incoming freshman class at the University of Chicago received a letter that condemned safe spaces as being at odds with “academic freedom”; the school joined many conservative critics who have argued against safe spaces as an overly sensitive and even undesirable liberal ideal.
Though many different definitions exist, I see a safe space as one that asks individuals to think critically about the implications that their words and actions can have on others’ feelings of safety — particularly members of marginalized communities. It’s an especially important practice during conversations about sex. I do not see this as being at odds with productive, multi-sided, and even controversial discussion.
I study Social Studies and wrote my thesis on the ethics of pornography. This path through Harvard is how I came to direct an ethical and feminist erotic film, celebrate a live sex show, channel energy in a spiritual sex ritual, and feel absolutely safe in all of these circumstances — far safer, frankly, than I do on a daily basis. I walk past four or five — depending on which route I take — men-only spaces on my way home from class every single day. Google Alerts directs me to at least one news article per day that mentions the hashtag #MeToo. Since posting about my research and film work on social media, I have received regular unsolicited DMs from creepy men that are almost never related to my work itself.
Inspired by the safe spaces I’ve encountered, the work that I do now focuses on creating safe spaces for people to talk about sex. A few months ago, I was able to screen one of the porn films I produced to a room full of 30 fellow students. After the screening, I led a conversation about the film. Standing behind the podium in front of the room, sweating, I began by establishing: “This is a safe space, and that is my number one priority.” As I surveyed the audience, a room full of eager eyes stared back at me.
When it comes to sex and sexuality, there is no single right way to approach these conversations. The only wrong approach is to stop having them entirely. This feels like the best explanation for the work I — along with so many other sex-positive thinkers, writers, artists, and educators — am doing. Schools, workplaces, and the internet each deserve careful attention. But my hope is that one day we won’t have to designate these spaces as safe. Because, really, all space should be safe. Why do we have to remind people to recognize the humanity of others?

Hello, reader!
Here at FM, we think categories are a little silly. This may come as a surprise, seeing as our magazine is largely based on content categories. They’re useful, of course — but non-essential at the end of the day. That’s why, for our 2019 Year in Review issue, we’ve chosen a theme that allows us to lean both into and away from categories. Welcome to: The Boundaries Issue.
The pun was unfortunately too irresistible to pass up, so we’ve crammed these glossy pages chock-full of content that pushes, explores, breaks, and affirms boundaries. We chatted with a host of people whose work explores boundaries in some way or another, whether they’ve broken down barriers in their field or pushed the borders of academic disciplines. And some of our writers have turned inwards, reflecting on the limits that they experience and surpass in their own lives.
The most literal boundaries in this issue are perhaps ecological — seawalls and the perimeter of Arnold Arboretum, courtesy of MHM and TTJ, respectively. JED pivots to the digital world with an investigation of students who upload college admissions reaction videos to YouTube. AKEC talks to accepted students in her reported essay exploring emotional labor in affinity groups. We invite you to explore — and, if you’d like, expand the boundaries of your own mind. Get it?
Yours in high-gloss print,
NMM & ALS

If you’ve ever been walking near Adams and you’ve seen what looks like a tiny teddy bear roaming around, have no fear: You’ve just been blessed by Pepper, the toy cockapoo owned by two tutors in Adams House. It’s hard not to feel complete joy and an immediate need to pet him when you come across this tiny ball of fluff, so when we heard that he wouldn’t be residing in Adams next year, we had to go learn more.
Tutors Sheila A. Gholkar and Vinayak Muralidhar have had Pepper for just over a year, and he’s been an adorable addition from the start. “When we first got him, you could literally hold him in the palm of your hand,” said Gholkar. “We couldn’t even find a collar that was small enough for him!” He’s grown a bit in the past year, but as the runt of his litter he’s still the perfect size to carry around. While it may seem surprising, he’s actually fully grown, so he’ll be staying perfectly pint-sized.
Students in Adams are especially fond of Pepper’s “puppy office hours,” where they can sign up to spend a few minutes one-on-one with him. With even those outside of the House asking for the chance to spend time with this popular pup, his social schedule rivals that of even the most outgoing students on campus. Pepper is a big fan of the students too, as he can often be seen standing by his door waiting in excitement for his next visitor to come.
Pepper loves to be anywhere he can see other people around campus, but one of his favorite spots is the security office in Claverly Hall. There may be a “Warning: Security Dog” sign making his presence known, but don’t worry — he’s anything but threatening and loves to sit there for hours greeting students who are coming home after a long day of classes.
Beyond puppy office hours and his favorite hang-out spots, he’s also known to spend some time in the spotlight. At this point, nearly everyone has seen the legendary Adams Housing Day video, but next time you watch be sure to pay close attention during the scene in the main lobby: You may spot a very special cameo!
Pepper isn’t just a favorite of students around campus; he’s also a volunteer for Pets as Therapy. Every week, he and other dogs of faculty members and tutors travel to the Cambridge Rehabilitation and Nursing Center to spend time with its residents. Though he’s known to be pretty energetic, he does a great job when volunteering and has become pals with some of the other dogs in the group!
Now, for the bad news: Unfortunately for those of us new to Pepper, he and his family will be moving away from campus this upcoming summer. But, don’t start your mourning yet — Pepper isn’t going far! “We’ll be staying in Cambridge, so you’ll definitely still be seeing us around,” said Gholkar. Though Pepper sightings may be a bit more rare in the future, that’s even more reason to cherish every opportunity you get to see this sweet pup around campus!
