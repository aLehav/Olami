After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Waiting 25 minutes after the designated time for an act to perform is never fun—but when it’s for The Strokes, it's worth it, especially given the performance they gave as the headliners of the first night of Governors Ball.
Many were confused as to why The Strokes were chosen to headline the first night of the beloved music festival: They had just performed at Governors Ball two years earlier in 2014 and had remained under the radar ever since. But it would appear that after the long list of newer artists who performed at Gov Ball that day, the nostalgia with which fans remember The Strokes was just what the festival needed as the band belted out the greatest hits from their famous debut album, “Is This It,” to a sea of t-shirts bearing their name.
The performance was not merely a throwback to the group’s more prolific and popular days, however; The Strokes shared several singles off their new EP in addition to their usual set of garage rock staples. But when these tracks seemed to garner less enthusiastic reactions from the crowd, the performers quickly returned to the classics that won them their fans in the first place.
But not everything was charged with the electricity The Strokes are known to bring to their music. The rock band took a break midway through their set to pay tribute to Brett Kilroe, who created many of their classic album covers and who served as the group’s director of cinematography for years. Kilroe passed away in March after a four-year long battle with cancer. After a touching slideshow chronicled the band’s time with their art designer, from their work together on cover albums to the design of the layout of their shows, lead vocalist Julian Casablancas spoke a bit about the late Kilroe. “He knew everyone better than they knew themselves,” he said before the band played a song to commemorate the artist’s life and show the audience what he meant to them.
When it was time to say goodbye, the band thanked their audience for all their enthusiasm and love; the thousands of people present remained standing in front of the stage, however, awaiting an encore performance they hoped would come. Here The Strokes didn't disappoint. Despite not having performed encores for their past three albums, the band performed a few more songs before their finale turned explosive—literally, with a long period of fireworks to close out the first day of Governors Ball.

The circumstances of HAIM’s show on Saturday afternoon gave them an uphill battle to fight from the start—a storm front moved in rapidly over the course of the performance, and by about 30 minutes in the sky had completely opened up. Pouring rain isn’t usually a welcome sight for outdoor performers, but the powerhouse Haim sisters embraced the situation, responding to the rain by exuding enough energy to help a soaked crowd ignore the moisture. HAIM are a well-oiled machine live, and one that’s a joy to watch. The trio never faltered, and the set built irresistibly until a climactic drum-jam punctuated the experience (lead singer and guitarist Danielle plays drums on their studio releases). HAIM played three new originals from a forthcoming album, performing them so seamlessly and with such a pointed energy that it seemed like they’d been playing them for years. And of course “The Wire” and “Falling” are even more impossible to resist dancing to live. HAIM have stepped into the spotlight, and they’re an absolute pop-rock powerhouse. Live, that’s impossible to deny.
Mac Miller celebrated the fifth anniversary of his most popular release, the track “Donald Trump,” this past February. A lot has changed for him since then—he’s been to rehab, and these days he’s feuding with the presumptive Republican nominee for the second time since the release of that breakout track. A sober(-er), happier Mac Miller makes for more thoughtful hip-hop, and that was on display on Saturday afternoon as a grinning Miller took the stage. He performed a different version of “Donald Trump” in 2016, the chorus replaced with a repeated chant of “F--- Donald Trump!” (which the crowd, of course, ate up). Little tweaks like that made the juxtaposition of his newer, more introspective tracks and the old boisterous ones a little less jarring. There’s more singing on his newest LP, “GO:OD AM,” and he pulled it off pretty well live. Still, though, the most tasteful thing Miller did all set was to not sing over a tribute to Prince and to just give a thankful grin while “Purple Rain” blasted over the sound system.
De La Soul have been around for a long time—almost 30 years. That’s an eternity in hip-hop years. That’s longer than Snoop Dogg. Their first release came seven years before the Notorious B.I.G.’s “Ready to Die” was released (and seven years before the author of this article was born, to be clear). What that means is that De La Soul occupy a unique place in the hip-hop world—they’re as close as hip-hop gets to something like classic rock. The rap trio exuded energy at the Big Apple stage, getting the crowd involved and even addressing individual crowd members. Performing classics like “Eye Know,” De La rocked a large crowd.

Although The Killers were the headliner for the day, it was Miguel’s performance that stole the show. He brought the erotic undertones that are now a staple of his music to the forefront of his set, channeling ardent sexuality in the physicality of his performance to win over his crowd despite the pouring rain that lasted throughout the night.
In a near striptease of a show, Miguel’s hip thrusts were the showrunner. His sensual dance moves and sultry crooning perfectly conveyed the undeniable sexiness of his music and lyrics—and it certainly didn’t hurt when he shed his colorful poncho and eventually ripped his shirt off to perform half-naked and wet. “Fuck the rain!” he exclaimed, before quickly retracting the statement: “Love the rain!” The audience had no choice but to do so, as it started pelting shortly after. Miguel didn’t leave us to suffer alone, however. Joining us under the downpour, he performed in solidarity with us, getting as soaked as his fans did.
But the rain did little to hinder the R&B singer’s set; rather, it no doubt enhanced it. Pumped by his audience’s refusal to shy away from the rain, Miguel came off stage and joined the crowd, attempting to crowd surf, though that was quickly put to an end when fans went wild and their excitement escalated to the brink of mayhem.
As he played the crowd-pleasers his fans love, Miguel seemed touched when people started singing along. With his passion infecting the crowd, audience members were swaying and grooving along just as hard as he was, and he surprised fans with a treat for their endearing energy. A cover of both Bob Marley’s “Stir it Up” and 2Pac’s “I Get Around,” as well as a mashup of “How Many Drinks?” and Kendrick Lamar’s “Swimming Pools,” were sprinkled throughout the set.

“This kid's good!” commented a passerby, noticing the throng that had gathered around the Big Apple Stage to watch Jon Bellion’s set. Seeing how comfortable he seemed on stage, it’s hard to believe that the crowd was the largest for which Bellion had ever performed, as he mentioned. With an explosive performance—the last in a while due to the impending release of “The Human Condition,” his sophomore album—of debut album lead single “Jim Morrison,” Bellion brought everyone to their feet and had all nodding along with him to the beat of the music. In addition, the singer displayed another talent that had fans cheering him on. By way of an impressive show of beatboxing in which his drummist imitated his striking beats, Jon Bellion gave way to boyish excitement at his audience’s shared enthusiasm.
A special treat given the busy schedule their upcoming album has forced them to adhere to, Misterwives’s performance was as cheery and uplifting as their songs are known to be. The entire band kept the energy alive throughout the whole set, with lead singer Mandy Lee interjecting cheesy but genuinely inspirational words of staying true to oneself to the crowd.
In an attempt to bring exposure and experience to students of the performing arts in the city where the group is based, Misterwives brought out the LaGuardia High School choir to sing as backup for two songs; unfortunately, the students looked as awkward and uncomfortable as the crowd seemed confused about their presence there. Despite the mishap, Misterwives soon got back on their feet with a new song, presumably the first single off their new album, “Machine.” “For everyone who marched to the beat of their drum,” said Lee of the song’s target audience, continuing in the same “be yourself” vein that has become an essential part of Misterwives’s image.
Don’t be fooled: While people were certainly trying to stay dry from the torrent of rain pouring throughout the entirety of the set, the huge congregation underneath the Bacardi House Stage tent was there first and foremost to experience the trippy experience that is Purity Ring’s music. Psychedelic lights and a nearly overwhelming instrumental soundscape on Corin Roddick’s part rendered the experience so surreal that no one in the audience even needed the marijuana permanently infused in the air to travel to the other world that the band creates. While vocalist Megan James’s singing complements Roddick’s sound in the studio, she lacked the power to be the audience’s real focus live, overpowered by the beat. Nevertheless, the duo’s performance was a standout—one that rivaled both the wistfulness of The Strokes and the sexiness of Miguel.
As the headliners for the evening, The Killers were unpredictably arbitrary in their delivery, but overall fun and entertaining as they brought back the audience to older times. Though their entire set felt like a long session of karaoke, with the audience singing along to most of their songs, The Killers were sure enough of themselves to play their most popular songs early on; opening with their most famous song, “Mr. Brightside,” they seemed ready to continue on with the same hype it initially garnered. Using their relatively more recent “Human” as a sort of refrain throughout the night, the group was admittedly successful in keeping the crowd’s attention, despite the mud and rain everywhere. As with The Strokes the night before, the band came back out for an encore performance to the thrill of the festival’s second set of fireworks. While theirs wasn’t the best performance of the night, The Killers continued in the tradition of this year’s Gov Ball of nostalgia-inducing rock bands as closing acts.

Bassist/singer/jazz-fusion savant Stephen Bruner (a.k.a. Thundercat) enjoyed a real wave of success in 2015—as an extensive session musician for Kendrick Lamar’s now-legendary “To Pimp a Butterfly,” he experienced a big jump in exposure. Capitalizing on that, he released his brilliant third album, “The Beyond/Where the Giants Roam.” This was the year Thundercat started to rise beyond, in popular awareness, his former role as Flying Lotus’s zany right-hand man at progressive jazz/electronic record label Brainfeeder. Thundercat started the year opening sold-out shows in small venues for FlyLo and soon became impossible to deny as a titanic force of his own.
Thundercat’s exuberant performance on Saturday made clear that he’s comfortable in this position and still wants more. The set list showcased the depth that his discography has already taken on, even as he limited himself to a 6-song set. Thundercat has largely made his name as a session musician, having collaborated with the likes of Erykah Badu, Mac Miller, and Suicidal Tendencies in addition to the aforementioned Kendrick Lamar, but you haven’t really gotten to know Thundercat without seeing him live. His three-piece band—he’s joined live by raucous drummer Justin Brown and slick keyboardist Dennis Hamm—injects the smooth soul inflections of his studio compositions with a roiling jazz-fusion energy. Thundercat’s harmonically complex songs become even more nuanced and rhythmically adventurous, with the band opening up almost every song in order to shred solos over the changes for a few minutes. It’s a pleasure to watch—and judging from the mannerisms of the performers, who grin and grimace in pleasure at each other’s musical inventions, it’s a pleasure to perform too. Brown’s lively, amped-up drumming gave the group a visceral sucker-punch kind of energy, while Hamm took a low-key backseat in keeping the songs tightly mellifluent. While some of Thundercat’s studio recordings evoke R&B legends like Marvin Gaye, the live performance called to mind Chick Corea’s “Return to Forever” or a jamming Pat Metheny.
The group’s performance wasn’t simply a dive into the jazz-fusion rabbit hole, though. The trio remained keenly aware of Thundercat’s place in pop culture, not neglecting to cover the track “Complexion” off of Lamar’s “TPAB” (to which Thundercat of course contributed). During that song Thundercat shouted out the name of Lamar’s label, Top Dawg Entertainment—he knows he’s closely aligned with them in many people’s minds, and he likes it. The small amount cross-pollination between Brainfeeder, Thundercat’s label, and TDE that’s occurred thus far has borne wonderful fruit, and hearing the bassist craft a beautiful solo over “Complexion” was a gleaming example of that. The real cultural and emotional epicenter of the set, though, was when the group performed Thundercat’s most popular original song, “Heartbreaks + Setbacks.” A truly heavenly composition, “Heartbreaks” is possibly the most uplifting and heartening song of mourning released in the past ten years. Hearing Bruner’s pure voice rising above a melancholy soundscape singing “You know we tried way too hard to find / A love that’s really blind / So why even try? / Because we know / That there’s still hope / Just don’t let go” was an experience truly in tune with the hopeful liberation of love. Thundercat’s come to spread the love, and he’s got a new LP with Flying Lotus on the way. He’s here to stay.

Mila Gauvin II:
I take it easier today, arriving in the early afternoon just in time to see Jon Bellion perform. I wonder whether it’s the availability Saturdays provide or if it’s Bellion’s performance that has amassed the throng of people milling about the Big Apple Stage, but I’m not complaining. More people bring more zest and buoyancy to what is already a lively event, and today we’re going to need it; yesterday the rain wasn’t too bad, but today it’s going to pour.
I stay camped in front of the stage for about an hour in a valiant attempt to get up close and personal with Misterwives, the next act, and unexpectedly run into a friend from college. In the midst of the thousands of people jampacked onto this tiny island, you’ll probably find a familiar face sooner or later. Though I lose her within the next five minutes, knowing she is here and pondering the other people here who I might also know, I appreciate Gov Ball’s uniting capabilities.
Deciding to not starve myself, I reluctantly go and buy myself a meal. It’s good, but in the meantime I lose my chance of getting a good spot to see Mac Miller. The crowd for him is enormous, the biggest I’ve seen so far for an act who isn’t a headliner. When it finally disperses—and with the amount of people there, it took a while—I stare at the hundreds of people still crowded at the front of the stage. Just as I remained after Jon Bellion’s performance for Misterwives, many have taken advantage of the scattering mass of people to approach the stage in preparation for Miguel, who is up next on the Honda Stage. I become one of the dreaded hasslers, pushing my way forward and towards the middle of the throng. Luckily, I have the excuse that my friend—another one—is saving a spot for me. When I reach him, we wait impatiently for Miguel to come onstage, and when he does, we are not disappointed.
Soaked from head to toe after standing in the rain during Miguel’s electrifying set, I hurry to take cover under the Bacardi House tent just in time to see Purity Ring take the stage. After I am sufficiently spaced out from their music, I trudge through the mud that people are crowding onto the concrete to avoid walking through. My shoes are ruined, and my legs are caked with drying sludge, but at least I can make it to the GovBallNYC Stage faster and in time for The Killers.
Though I’m enjoying the show, I leave before the encore performance everyone stays to wait for, trying to beat the rush and avoid spending the unnecessary hour I wasted trying to leave yesterday. I’m looking forward to tomorrow, the third and final day of Gov Ball, when some of my favorite performers…. Who am I kidding? I can’t wait to see Kanye.

Michael L. McGlathery:
There’s nothing quite like a downpour to remind you that the real reason you’ve come to a music festival is for the music, not the ambiance. With all the money poured into making sure today’s corporate music festivals (Governors Ball was recently acquired by global behemoth LiveNation) glitter and intrigue, it can be easy to lose track of the fact that they still depend on musicians as their lifeblood. As the dark clouds started to close in on Saturday afternoon and the drops began to fall, people started to move. Some walked briskly to the exits; some whipped out cheap, transparent ponchos; and some, myself included, moved under the shelter of a few of the festival’s large trees. My friends and I were watching HAIM, and under the shelter of the tree we were about 100 yards away from the stage. As the rain picked up, the tree kept us less and less dry, and we had to make a decision: Leave, seek the shelter of the festival’s only large tent, or lean into being drenched and push our rain jacket-less bodies close to the stage? Half opted for the tent, where we were to watch Purity Ring in a half hour. A few friends and I chose to push forward. The first few minutes were full of ambivalence at our increasingly soaked clothes, but by the time HAIM jumped into their infectious, anthemic hit “The Wire” we had forgotten about all that and were bouncing along with the crowd, wet hair whipping around. Though I wrecked a pair of shoes and infected an entire duffel bag of clothes with mildew as a result of my decisions, that’s not the way I’ll remember HAIM’s show. That’s not the way I’ll remember Purity Ring. That’s not the way I’ll remember M83. And that’s certainly not the way I’ll remember Thundercat’s orgasmic (and dry!) afternoon set.
When music festivals flirt with enduring serious or semi-serious weather, they flirt with disaster. In 2013, a tropical storm turned Governors Ball into a sloshing mudpit, resulting in a scary close call with a short circuit for performer Feist and an early end to the festival’s first day. While that iteration of Gov Ball was able to somehow push through the next two days, other festivals have met worse fates. In September 2015, the Tomorrowland festival in Georgia saw rainfalls that stranded thousands of attendees in the mud, far from any passable roads. Fortunately, Saturday saw a manageable enough amount of rain for the headliners to perform (though Governors Ball canceled Sunday’s lineup due to safety concerns).
So I can understand the decision to head home when the rain clouds made good on their threat—there’s no shame in assuring a safe trip home. But those who stayed at the festival enjoyed a special treat: a music festival with slightly smaller crowds, and crowds enjoying the music with slightly more reckless abandon. The audience roared and stared in wonder at the dark majesty of Purity Ring’s set and the genius of their almost-holographic light setup. A thrillingly small crowd crowded the stage to feel the booming pulse of M83’s expansive pop. And a screaming, sopping mass pumped their fists to the chorus of “The Wire.” Come hell or high water, the music will always enchant.
