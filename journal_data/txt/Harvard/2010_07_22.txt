After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI, China—When I met my boss at the newspaper I am interning for in Shanghai—a newspaper that publishes entirely in Chinese—I was surprised when he greeted me in English.
"Hello!" he beamed, confidently extending is hand for a handshake—a western custom many Chinese find uncomfortable. "To our department, we welcome you with happy."
Biting my lip a little to stop myself from smiling too much, I responded in Chinese. "Thank you, I'm looking forward to working here."
"You speak Chinese!" he said in surprise. "But we are international department, now that you join us. We will only speak English with you! Together we can have good English. Together we make you happy, we happy. That is our destiny."
I chuckled a little at the word “destiny," wondering where he had picked up that word, of all words, to use in daily conversation (he used it at least twice more that day). A few minutes later, when we were talking about movies, he mentioned that he had watched Slumdog Millionaire multiple times. Ah, so that was where.
It's not just my boss (whose self-given English name is O'Sullivan) who shows so much enthusiasm for American customs and for learning and practicing English. It's my coworkers, the cleaning lady at my hotel, the Expo volunteer being bombarded with questions, and the man I see during my morning runs.
It's funny because here I am, having taken three years of Chinese, and eager to become fluent, but people want to hear my native language instead. They're excited that I know Chinese, but they encourage me to speak English, and they repeat my words in an accent that makes me marvel at the way languages morph when combined with a different speaking habit. I wonder just how ridiculous my Chinese sounds to them.
The real irony is that though you'd think I'd be relieved to communicate in English, I actually dread having to speak it here. It probably helps them learn, but for me, the communication lag is more excruciating. While English is taught in school often from an early age in China, and pricey ESL programs like “Disney English” and “Wall Street English” thrive, people don’t always have the opportunity to really practice it. Just like how I took 6 years of French in middle and high school, but I might as well be mute when I talk to a real French person.
I've sadly realized I'm selfish with language. When my coworkers speak to me in English, I find myself automatically completing their sentences when they pause to find the right word—filling in their thoughts before they have a chance to do so themselves. They rarely complete my thoughts for me when I speak Chinese, waiting patiently without even a hint of exasperation.
It's not a lesson of language; it's one of patience. Perhaps it's one that many Americans have to learn. I teach ESL to Chinese immigrants in Boston, and it's easy to have patience in the classroom setting for only two hours a week. But these immigrants have to have the patience to understand and be understood every day. I'll never forget how one elderly student, when asked to write about his weekend for homework, gave me a heart-wrenching story about how he had approached the local senior center to find out what they were doing for Thanksgiving (he had no family in the area). He speaks English well, but very slowly. He said the receptionist rolled her eyes as he spoke each halting word and got frustrated at him, eventually yelling at him to go away and get a translator. He went home and spent the holiday alone. Reading the story nearly brought me to tears, but to him—and all my students—such short-tempered encounters unfortunately are common.
As my boss said yesterday, “International exchange of the culture. That is our dazzling destiny.”

SHANGHAI, China – The bricks on the sidewalk beneath my feet are perfectly aligned—newly laid for the World Expo; I can still smell fresh paint on the walls and highways. As night falls, sparking LED lights illuminate luxury brand storefronts, glass skyscrapers glisten with swirling neon patterns, and  trees along the street alight with glowing magenta orbs and flashing silver teardrops.  A bright orange Bugatti sports car drives by, and a woman, pale and willowy as a porcelain doll, peers at me from the passenger seat.
It is 8:00pm and, I am working as an intern at a PR firm, staffing a fashion show for a high-end retailer’s centennial celebration.  The spotlights and camera flashes are blinding, as VIP guests glide across the red carpet. Women with designer handbags slung casually by their waists and men with silk pocket squares barely acknowledge me as I scan their invitations and welcome them to the event.  The fashion show and after party are a whirlwind of models, champagne and booming music.
On the surface, Shanghai is a dazzling neon-metropolis. But behind the newly erected walls glistening with fresh paint, are the shikumen of old Shanghai, the slums, the homes of the laobaixing, the common people. Like Beijing during the Olympics, Shanghai hastily tried to hide “less desirable” aspects of the city from the swarms of tourists and international media for the World Expo—but at what cost?
A few days before the fashion show, I was wandering only a block away from the most cosmopolitan streets and shopping areas when I found myself in one of the neighborhoods that the city was trying so hard to hide—in a different Shanghai, where the most common modes of transportation are not luxury sports cars, but bicycles, three wheeled carts and mopeds.  Strings of bright laundry on lines took the place of neon lights. Skyscrapers and department store windows were replaced with open market stalls from which fried buns sizzle on giant cast iron pans, lantern-red crayfish scurry in crates by rolling vats of spicy broth, and farmers with tan skin and straw hats lounge by pickup trucks full of watermelons.
I walked past a woman in pajamas and slippers is carrying a plastic bag of warm buns and a group of men having a drink on three legged stools, into a restaurant built beneath a family’s home.  The menu, handwritten in cursive Chinese scrawl, was stained with soy sauce and the food was served on mismatched plates, but the flavors and aromas awaken fading memories of my own Shanghainese grandparents.
In a few years this neighborhood will probably be gone, replaced by another skyscraper or mall, and the woman in the slippers and the family who owns the restaurant, relocated.  As China hastily races to embrace modernity, I can’t help but think, that the quintessence of this nation may lie not on the next new development, but beneath the trail of the bulldozers.

SANTIAGO, Chile—“Does it bother you that I go out all the time?” I asked my Chilean host dad. He was driving me to a house party thrown by a friend of mine…on a Monday night.
Apparently, it does not bother him in the least. As it turns out, my question demonstrated my lack of understanding of Chilean culture. In Chile, he told me, young people are expected to go out and socialize as much as possible. Chilean youth start partying and clubbing when they are in their mid-teens, with the full approval of their parents.
As a norteamericana, I sometimes find it difficult to comprehend how much value Chileans place on building community and strong social ties—the right social ties, that is.
Socialization is extremely important because social networks are the key to success in Chilean society, which is fairly classist and socially segregated. The friends you make in grade school, my Chilean dad tells me, will be your friends for life. You get to know a certain group of friends, and all their relatives as well, and after you graduate from university you have a vast network of contacts from which you can draw upon to get a good job. Just about everyone in the top echelons of Chilean government and business went to school together.
Unlike in the U.S., most Chileans go to universities located close to home and continue to live with their parents all the way into their twenties. Many attend university with friends whom they’ve grown up with. In fact, you can tell a lot about a Chilean by asking him or her where she went to grade school, because from the name of the school you can tell where that person lives, roughly what his or her socioeconomic status is, and which social circles he or she moves in.
The most sought-after universities in Chile occupy a social cache similar to that once held by the Ivy League, and top Chilean grade schools and universities exact a hefty fee for the privilege of joining that cache.
In comparing Chile and the U.S., I recognize that social prestige has its place in American society as well—and that a Harvard degree still carries a certain amount of weight. But with the advent of comprehensive financial aid programs and the impressive array of top-flight non-Ivy private and public universities, going to a so-called “name-brand” school just isn’t the be all end all anymore.
There is value in the type of connections one makes at a place like Harvard, but I think there’s still a streak of individualism in American culture that runs counter to placing excessive importance on social networking. Young people move out as soon as possible, at least telling themselves that they can “make it” on their own. It isn’t uncommon to go to college thousands of miles from home, and to slowly lose touch with grade school friends. Connections are frequently made and broken, as people move through different stages in their lives.
In some ways, perhaps this is the lonelier path to take. But maybe it’s ultimately the fairer one. The Chilean social network provides valuable support for those lucky enough to enter into it early in life, but it also sets up limitations for those born outside its boundaries.

NEW YORK, NY – He is considered one of the greatest Jewish thinkers and scholars of the modern era. His photograph is ubiquitous in certain Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, some of which even consider him the messiah. His charisma, drive, and devotion have inspired emissaries to establish Jewish welcoming homes in over 3,000 locations worldwide.
And, according to a recently published biography, this man, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (“the Rebbe”)—the seventh and final leader of the Hasidic Chabad-Lubavitch dynasty—was actually a bit of a charlatan.
While neither my boss nor I are members of Chabad, one of the main tasks of my internship this summer has been to help my supervisor defend Schneerson’s reputation from two academics who believe that he was not quite as immaculate as he appeared. Published last month, their contentious biography seeks to provide an answer to the mystery that has long surrounded Schneerson’s life. Even after his death in 1994, the Rebbe remained an enigma, a leader who left behind reams of scholarship but very little insight into his personal psyche.
In a provocative thesis that has incensed many of Schneerson’s followers, the book posits that the Rebbe took on the role as head of a rabbinic dynasty primarily because it was steady work. In fact, the authors argue, for most of his formative years Schneerson was uninterested in the Hasidic lifestyle, dreaming instead of becoming a secular-minded engineer in Paris. After he assumed his post, however, the book asserts, Schneerson used his charisma and various “mystification” techniques to enhance his standing in the eyes of his followers, eventually leading some to champion him as the ultimate Jewish savior.
While prominent Jewish intellectuals outside the Chabad community have praised the book as “extraordinary” and “masterful,” those who dig a bit deeper will see that the book is rife with shoddy scholarship.
For example, the authors claim that Schneerson never wanted to pursue a life related to his Hasidic upbringing while blatantly ignoring reams of correspondence filled with Judaic lore that Schneerson exchanged with his Hasidic father and father-in-law. They also assert, based on a single photograph, that Schneerson was so proud of receiving his engineering degree that while in France he wrote his return address as “Eng. M. Schneerson.” Apparently, they misread the word in the photo—what they actually saw was “Exp. M. Schneerson,” shorthand for “expéditeur,” sender, as in “return to sender.”
Since most of the major figures to come to the Rebbe’s aid so far have been his own emissaries (one of whom penned a brilliant 45-page rebuttal to the book), the authors have been able to shrug off criticism effortlessly. “To believers,” they write, “it cannot be that the man who stands between them and God could have had a life like any other.” For this reason, what my supervisor and I eventually do with our information is crucial to the debate. My supervisor does not wish to be named, but suffice it to say that he has previously written for Slate and New York magazine.
Dismantling the thesis of this biography has been quite challenging and tedious, but also immensely fulfilling. Students and academics seem to spend so much time criticizing leaders historically held in high esteem that it is refreshing for once to help set the record straight by repairing a reputation. Indeed, by discovering and writing the truth about Schneerson, I feel as though I am, in effect, saving his afterlife.

ATHENS, Greece—Almost 30, what many would call a young professional, Tina sat over fried zucchini uncomfortably talking about her future. She is not making plans for a year from now, though her job in Athens has been a steady one until recently. We were at a restaurant three blocks from and four weeks-post the spot where three people were killed by the police in a riot. The night we ate, the street was calm, the restaurant busy, and the wait staff actively employed. As we talked, an enterprising street dog, still fat, eyed our meal.
But if Tina’s experience can be taken to be representative, the fallout of the “financial situation” (a phrase equivalent to PTSD in how removed from the root problem the terminology is) is just starting to make its way into the lives of the country’s residents.
According to The Seattle Times, the Greek government faces “growing discontent over a new round of economic austerity, with fresh strikes, public hostility, and party dissent testing the nation's ability to make it out of its debt crisis.” This struggle makes this “the biggest crisis yet seen in the move toward European integration that began more than half a century ago,” according to The New York Times.
I say "according to" because I've been in Greece for long over a month, and I see only hints of the discontent of the newspaper articles. I have looked for the obvious signs of economic despair—riot around the corner, a sale signs in windows, a restaurant closed at dinner time—but to me, the police office spraying the protestor in the back of the neck with the fire hose is as real as the photo in the newspaper. What I have seen has been far more subtle, far less sexy, and carries with it deeper, more problematic implications of what is still to come.
In Athens—the scene of the most newspaper coverage, the site of the riots, where the police hoses and tear gas have been brandished—my visit was calm. My arrival coincided with annual sale season, so I could not distinguish the usual 20% off signs from those that were there because the country’s debt now out-sizes its economy. The Acropolis was still packed with as many geriatrics as could pool their resources for the trip. And though transit workers struck three times during my three weeks there, businesses were still open on the day of the strikes.
In Mykonos, my next stop, island revelers splurged on appletinis like tomorrow God would rip them out of Eden. In Tinos and Naxos, I had to change hostels for a night because my primary one was over-booked my second evening; the beaches, even (if not especially) the nude ones, would be uncomfortable if more crowded.
But in Andros, an island on the outskirts of the tourist map, the dire numbers resonated more. In the past year, two of the island’s three travel agencies closed, one town’s police station merged with that of the town over, and the water taxi service shut for the year in anticipation of a slow tourist season. That said, masons in the largest town still worked day in and day out grinding at a horrid stonecutter machine to repave the main street in anticipation of the mid-July wear of tourists’ flip-flops.
The effects of the crisis, from what I can tell, are just starting to set in. A lawyer, trained in the US and practicing in Kolonaki, the frou-frou district of Athens, said that her VAT tax had just increased to 23%, meaning that she either takes a pay cut or charges her clients more going forward. A restaurant owner, when asked the price of a salad said that now it cost €12 but that in 10 days, which have now elapsed, the price would decrease by 20% to reflect his decrease in patronage. His restaurant owner friends, he said, are likely going to instate similar price shifts in the next few weeks.
But perhaps most palpable is the general sense that the future is unclear, and most problematic the sense that the government is inept. The average Greek speaks of the government with as much disdain as she would if it were revealed that the government had indeed taken the people’s money, built a pool with the funds, and then swam in the bills that remained.
The average Greek, envisioning the pool of cash, may be expressing what the husband of the Kolonaki-lawyer called “Mediterranean temperament” —in the best of interpretations to be excitable, in the worst of terms to be apocalyptic or hysterical for naught. Or this average Greek may be prophetic.

BOLOGNA, Italy—“American girls, I have not talked to one in so long,” started off the dark-haired, clear-eyed Italian boy standing across from me.
“But most of the girls I talked to…they are not like you.  They are….I don’t know….fat.  Why are you not?”
Mm, interesting line.
I had been standing at a party in a field half an hour outside Bologna’s city center for about three hours and I was not really feeling it at this point.
But Filippo did not give up.  Pointing out his red car in one corner of the field, he told me, “the backseat is so big, the girls, they uh make love.”
Blank looks from me.  His first line was bad, but this was just a cheap cliché.
“No, like, it is so big and nice and they really love that…The car,” he tried to clarify.
More than 24 hours having passed since my 2 am wake up call earlier that day to catch a cheap but inconveniently early flight from London,  I was too grumpy to enjoy what was undeniably hilarious.
But flying back to my internship in London, I realized that may have actually been one of the better moments of the weekend, which I had planned to be a reminiscent trip back to the city where I studied abroad last fall.
A few weeks earlier, I had booked my Ryanair flight back to Italy, with thoughts of returning to all my familiar favorites dancing through my head: gelato on via Funivia, an aperitivo at Byblos 2, pizza from La Mela, a walk through Piazza Maggiore and down via Zamboni.
From my first day landing in London, it had felt strange to be living in Europe but nowhere near the one European city that felt like home.
But upon my return I found that my friend Martin who I was staying with had acquired a transformative haircut, his apartment was in a part of Bologna I had never even seen before, and while his friends were fun, I didn’t know them. With my Italian seven months out of practice, I couldn’t keep up with their fast-paced conversations full of gossip about more people I had never met.
I felt silly dragging Martin and his friends around to all my old haunts so instead we ended up spending Friday night at some kind of benefit party in a field amongst Bologna’s hills. Aside from Filippo, the crowning jewel was a band of young Italians singing everything from semi-decent covers of the Black Eyed Peas to failed attempts at Madonna. And while it was an experience, it didn’t feel anything like home.
The weekend was another reminder of a lesson I have learned so many times before: just because something was good, that doesn’t mean you can or should try to recreate it.  Maybe especially because something was good.
Next time, I’ll have to enjoy Filippo’s faltering flirting more.

BEIJING, China—Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw called it the “new colonialism.” Ominous headlines abound about Chinese investment in Africa, as many in the U.S. and Europe worry about Africa falling under the influence of threatening China. However, in The Dragon’s Gift, Deborah Brautigam, a professor at American University, dispels many of these myths and shows that the investment is far more helpful than many believe.
Brautigam recently  spoke at the Beijing Bookworm, a local English-language bookstore. In her speech, she addressed the concern that China’s investment in Africa will make governance across the continent worse, because China invests in any state with which it has diplomatic relations. Yet, as she accurately notes, many Western companies also invest in countries such as Angola and Zimbabwe; the entrance of Chinese companies has not suddenly transformed the funding for rogue nations.
If anything, China might just be doing a better job of aid and investment than Western countries have done in Africa. Western countries have often given aid or investment directly to African governments, much of which then disappears.  On the other hand, as Brautigam described in the talk, the Chinese government often works aid, investment, and trade through Chinese companies, which then have clear projects to work on and an incentive to properly use the funds.
China’s investment in Africa is largely through commercially structured resource-backed loans. China extends a line of credit to the African country which is backed by the country’s resources; for example, Angola can pay its line of credit in oil and Ghana through cocoa. The credit is then used for Chinese goods and services, such as Chinese mining or agriculture operations. Such a structure allows African countries to leverage their resources to develop infrastructure, manufacturing, and a business community. African countries must be careful that they get enough revenue through these trade and investment deals, but in general, the new infrastructure and business is a refreshing development for the continent.
There are concerns about Chinese investment in Africa which Chinese and Western advocates should address. Chinese companies do offer the lowest wages and labor standards in Africa, and they also do not have high environmental standards. They have supported the Sudanese government during a mass genocide, but pressure by advocates has forced the Chinese to change their course, and, according to Brautigam, the U.S. now sees them as part of the solution in Sudan. Advocates must place similar pressure on China and other countries that invest on Africa (none of whom are much better) to improve labor, environmental and human rights standards.
Brautigam told an interesting story to begin her talk. About 40 years ago, an East Asian country was looking for new markets and found a large, poor region that desperately needed development and investment. The poor region was very wary of the investment, but they needed help so badly they were willing to give it a try. She was talking about Japan and China.  Decades later, Japan’s investment has paid off; China is on its way to becoming a rich country. If China’s investment in Africa is anywhere near as successful as Japan’s was in China, it will be one of the most important development success stories of this century.

In defense of the freedom of the press, several journalism and human rights organizations have rallied behind a Colombian journalist who was denied entrance into the United States to attend a program at Harvard.
An acclaimed human rights reporter and producer of an independent television news program, Hollman Morris Rincon is one of the 25 journalists awarded the Nieman Foundation fellowship for the 2010-2011 year. But Morris’ application for a student visa to participate in the Harvard program was denied on “security related grounds.”
A reporter known for his critical coverage of Colombia President Álvaro Uribe Vélez’s administration, Morris developed connections with sources who did not support the outgoing president—a move that could have been interpreted as terrorist activity, according to Nieman Foundation Curator Robert H. Giles.
Following the news that the Department of State denied Morris’ request for a visa, Giles wrote a tersely-worded editorial expressing the far-reaching impacts of the federal government’s decision.
“The denial is alarming,” Giles wrote in the piece. “It would represent a major recasting of press freedom doctrine if journalists, by establishing contacts with so-called terrorist organizations in the process of gathering news, open themselves to accusations of terrorist activities and the possibility of being barred from travel to the United States.”
Nieman Fellows from the class of 1988 have shown their support for Morris by sending e-mails to Juan Manuel Santos, who recently won the presidency of Colombia in a landslide election and had previously served as the finance minister under Uribe. Santos was a 1988 Nieman Fellow and the sub-director of his family-owned newspaper El Tiempo, which has the largest circulation in the country.
“We are asking him if he could be magnanimous and intercede in favor of Hollman Morris with the US government,” wrote 1988 Nieman Fellow Rosental C. Alves in an e-mailed statement.
Alves is a journalism professor at the University of Texas, Austin, where he heads the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. Alves collaborated with 30 members of the journalism faculty on a letter to Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg asking for assistance on the Morris situation.
“We believe that the opportunity to share in our nation’s great tradition of intellectual sharing and debate will benefit Mr. Morris as well as his fellow Nieman class at Harvard,” the letter stated.
“I am still hoping that this terrible mistake is corrected in time for Hollman Morris to move to Cambridge next month,” Alves said. “The State Department has been very quiet about it, but I am sure people there are hearing the surprise and frustration from all of us.”
Other organizations defending Morris include the Canadian Journalists for Free Expansion, a non-profit organization that promotes freedom of expression around the world. In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, the letter stated that “no credible evidence tying Morris to terrorism has ever surfaced.”
The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, the Human Rights Watch, and the Committee to Protect Journalists are other organizations participating in the fight against the denial of Morris’ entry into the United States.
The Nieman Fellowship Program is a mid-career program for journalists on the domestic and international field. Each year, at least 12 U.S. and 12 international journalists are selected to attend the year-long program at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.
Morris is the first Nieman Fellow to be denied a visa for entry into the United States, though other Fellows have met challenges to obtaining the student visa in the past.
Darby G. Holladay, spokesperson for the Department of State, responded on Wednesday to The Crimson’s request for comment by citing its privacy policy.
“Persuant to Section 222 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, visa records are confidential, and we are unable to discuss the specific details of Mr. Morris’ case,” Holladay said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard swimmer Alex Meyer ’10 was  unofficially announced this afternoon as the winner of the 6th FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships in Roberval.
Meyer beat out Italy's Valerio Cleri by just over one second to take  home the gold in the men's 25k. James Bown of Niagara Swimming circulated the unofficial results in  an e-mail after the competition.
Meyer, a former Crimson co-captain, was  invited to represent the United States at the international competition  that features swimmers from over 20 countries, after he secured two  fourth place finishes in the 5k and 10k at the U.S. National Open Water Swimming  Championships held in Long Beach, Calif.
While at Harvard, Meyer managed to rewrite the Crimson record books,  notching the second-fasted time in school history in the 1,650 free.  Meyer posted a time of 14:58.13 at the NCAA Championships in the event,  good for a 14th place finish.
In a sport where wall-to-wall coverage is not the norm, updates on race   status could be gleaned from Twitter, where one U.S. swimming  fan alerted viewers about two hours ago that Meyer had taken the lead with 4.5 km  to go.

For someone accustomed to swimming 1,650 meter competitions in indoor  pools, converting those skills into a 25,000 meter race out in the open  water is no easy task.
But former Harvard co-captain Alex Meyer proved that he had made a  successful transition when he took home the gold medal for the United  States in the 6th FINA World Open Water Swimming Championships in  Roberval, Canada on Thursday afternoon.
Competing against swimmers from over 10 different countries, Meyers  staged a come-from-behind victory in the final 2.5k of the five and a  half hour race. Meyer trailed behind Italy's Valerio Cleri by two  seconds when they were 22.5k into the race, but Meyers made up the lost  ground in the final stretch and edged past the Italian by just one  second with a finishing time of 5:32:39.380.
By defeating Cleri, the reigning champion of the 25k competition at  the 2009 World Aquatic Championships in Rome, Meyer gave the United  States its second gold medal in the bi-annual international competition  hosted by FINA, the international governing body of aquatic sports.
"Winning this race really means more to me than graduating from Harvard  in May," Meyer said in an interview with Swimming World Magazine. "I am an open water swimmer. I identify with this  sport, and also with the athletes competing here."
"Cleri is  one of the world's best open water swimmers, and I certainly thought he  would be the fastest in the field," Meyer added.  "I feel I am a better sprinter.  I  think I snuck up on Cleri, and I don't think he knew I was close behind  him."
Meyer began training for the open water competition following his  graduation from Harvard in May. As a member of the Crimson swimming  team, which competes solely in indoor competitions, Meyer had little  time to train for the open water event.
“He trained all spring while most of the seniors were having a good time,” said Crimson coach Tim Murphy, who helped Meyer train for the competition even after Meyer graduated. “He’s put a lot of [training] volume in.”
Just one week after Meyer received his diploma, he traveled to Long  Beach, Calif., to compete in the U.S. National Open Water Swimming  Championships, at which he secured two fourth place finishes in the 5k  and 10k, qualifying him for this past week's international competition  in Canada.
In the weeks leading up to the FINA World Open Water Swimming  Championships, Meyer trained with Murphy, often  swimming at the nearby Walden Pond.
“He’s only been a pool  swimmer so he focused on the pool all through college. But he has loved  open water swimming since he was 13,” said Meyer's mother, Shawn Meyer,  following the competition. “This summer, he graduated and was able to  focus on open water exclusively.”
The training seems to have paid off, as Meyer took home the gold  after competing in just his second career 25k race.
In his first 25k competition at the  2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Meyer was in fourth place  near the end of the 25k competition when he was disqualified for  swimming across the legs of a swimmer from another competition.
“It was heartbreaking for him,” Shawn Meyer said. “I think it made  him more determined… I know that [this gold medal] is immensely  important to him.”
While both Murphy and Meyer’s mother were not in attendance at the competition, Murphy said he received a picture on his phone of Meyer standing on the podium with the gold medal around his neck and the American flag above his head.
“There can’t be too much sweeter than that,” Murphy said.
Now that Meyer has taken home the gold for the  United States at the World Open Water Swimming Championships, his  goal is  to represent the country at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, according to his mother. Open  water swimming was first introduced as an Olympic sport at the 2008  summer games held in Beijing.
“Needless to say, he’s got a lot of ground to cover to get there,” Murphy said.
While at Harvard, the former co-captain managed to rewrite the  Crimson record books, notching the second-fasted time in school history  in the 1,650 free. Meyer posted a time of 14:58.13 at the NCAA  Championships in the event, good for a 14th place finish.
“He’s just made a huge contribution to the program,” Murphy said, “He will be hugely missed. He just came in from day one and was competitive.”
Meyer could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.

Travis R. Kavulla ’06-’07 has more than a hat and slick website backing his bid to be Commissioner of the Public Service Commission—the Montana native has a rich past that involves an active undergraduate career at Harvard, The National Review, Kenya, and energy policy.
“I've always been kind of an energy policy nerd,” Kavulla said in an interview with FlyBy, right before he left for a hiking trip.
Kavulla didn't realize this interest until his senior year of college, during which he took to studying energy policy in his free time while completing his History concentration requirements.
At the same time, Kavulla worked as a Crimson columnist and served as the editor of The Harvard Salient, holding that position during a time when former University President Lawrence H. Summers' administration fell under criticism. The Salient republished the infamous Danish cartoons that had much of the Muslim world up in arms.  
 
That and other interests stayed with Kavulla throughout his time after Harvard as he traveled the world as an investigative journalist for The National Review, a biweekly magazine founded by William F. Buckley Jr. with a conservative bent. In his travels and studies, Kavulla explored topics as diverse as religion in eastern Africa and energy policy in the United States.
Kavulla remembers his time at Harvard as educational in more ways than one: he recalled how his conservative ideas were often challenged at the school, and how such experiences helped him to appreciate that “so many people of such different political persuasions have very good points.”
Now Kavulla wants to bring what he describes as a “practical” stance on energy policy to Montana’s Public Service Commission, the body responsible for overseeing and regulating use of utilities and energy in Montana.
“I’d certainly like to explore fuel resources that lead to low-cost energy,” Kavulla said. “Unfortunately...we’re working out problems trying to get energy out of substances that are not energy rich,” he continued, citing more traditional sources like electric energy as a good source of energy and a building block of the economy.
Kavulla has already beaten out one opponent by a margin of 10 percent for the Republican nomination. With some luck and a website that Kavulla said one of his friends described as surely the nicest website ever made for someone running for Public Service Commissioner, Kavulla  may achieve his goal of becoming Commissioner for Montana’s first of five districts and serve a key role in shaping energy policy in that state for the next four years.
