After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Think of a playlist of all your recent favorite songs. Now think of all your recent favorite movies and TV shows. Now the news media you consume. Now your favorite celebrities or trendy fashion styles at the moment. Now remove all of the items on those lists that are not themselves black people, or have not been created by or significantly contributed to by black people. Either those lists just got a lot shorter — if they even still exist — or you actively avoid American popular culture.
Black people, we really do have a disproportionate voice in shaping American popular culture. Too many people worked too hard, for too long, for that to be the case and have us not realize and take advantage of it. Black voices are unavoidable in contemporary America. In this country, one would have to put in a considerable effort to raise a child who has not heard about some form of the black American experience.
We need to internalize, as black Americans, that our voice is heard now. And we should act like it. We should stop letting ourselves be infuriated by the apparent fact that the existing power structures can’t hear us and start speaking confidently with the knowledge that they will, and do, hear us. We should know, now, that if they do not act it is a matter of conscious choice that they will have to explain.
The frustration we experience is not that the issues facing black Americans are not known — it’s that there is a lackluster effort to solve any of them by the powers that be. The American or even world population cannot ignore us anymore even if they want to. Every social movement, social media campaign, and piece of political activism started by black people draws national and international attention. However, this lovely growth in the reach of black voices has not coincided with a similar (if any in some cases) change in the standards of living of black people.
It would be recklessly dismissive of me to not acknowledge that this current state we find ourselves in is not due to a lack of trying from within black communities. It is this persistent institutional inaction on solvable issues like the Flint water crisis, after the efforts of so many black people to bring attention to them, that justifies and inspires my current positions.
Do I claim to know the one-step solution to fixing all our issues? No — trust me, I would have done it already. What I do know is that black America is a socio-political force that needs to better organize itself to achieve its goals.
It is time we start to throw our political weight around on our own terms. Not on the terms of “who’s going to hurt us the least” as we often find ourselves doing at election time. No one is getting elected easily without us, and we should act like it.
No one can be popular in U.S. national politics without our social endorsement. That is power. Power we most certainly have not always had. We should lean into that power knowing that although we may not yet own much literal real estate in America, we own a huge square footage of the social fabric of this country — bigger than we realize — and we can and must leverage all we have of the latter to acquire the former.
For us here at Harvard this means that we should be confident in asking the University for what we want to see happen — whether that be the creation of a community space, the meaningful reconciliation of the legacy of slavery at this institution, or whatever else the community decides. Provided that we organize through some forum that can advocate for our desires, be it the Black Students Association or a newly created one for this purpose, the administration will hear it and either have to take action or publicly explain their inaction.
Black America, we have enough social capital in this country to start using it. And use it effectively we must if we are to see the changes we desire take form.
We already talk loud; now let’s talk smart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What do you do at divinity school?” a student I proctor asked me at Annenberg Hall. “I’m studying to be a minister,” I responded, and was met with a silence. I sometimes wish I were more helpful for my students’ worldly aspirations. While I also harbor vain ambition for fame, I came here to contemplate God.
Built in the 1870s to memorialize over a hundred Harvard men who fell during the Civil War, Annenberg “dispenses...laurels to the dead and dinners to the living” in the words of Henry James. Many of the dead whose names are engraved, as well as men and gods immortalized in the paintings, sculptures, and stained glasses that adorn Annenberg, were animated by God.
So I offer this piece as a prayer for my students, even though spirituality may not be at the forefront of first-year consciousness. Despite a gap-year pilgrimage that included India and Israel, I was not interested in the ultimate questions when I arrived at the University of Pennsylvania, founded secular by Benjamin Franklin. A decade later, my conversations with Harvard freshmen center on classes and clubs.
But Harvard was founded religious, and the Memorial Church that commemorates more than a thousand Harvard war-dead still serves as the spiritual fulcrum of the sprawling university. “Insofar as we all find some cause, calling, or community to sacrifice our time and resources to, we are all religious,” wrote a Crimson columnist who graduated last spring. By the time my freshmen graduate, some may glimpse divinity at the threshold of humanity.
John Harvard was a Cambridge-educated English minister who immigrated to New England. He caught tuberculosis within a year of his arrival in Boston, and donated 400 books and half his estate to the “colledge” in “Newetowne” before his death in 1638 at the age of 30. Like many gods, no records of his birth survive. Like many gods, Harvard’s origins were modest.
According to the 1643 book titled “New Englands First Fruits” which contains the first mention of Harvard College, Puritan colonists founded Harvard “dreading to leave an illiterate Ministery to the Churches, when our present Ministers shall lie in the Dust.” Harvard’s original motto was: “Truth for Christ and the Church.”
Harvard’s founders were fastidious in their orthodoxy. Its first president Henry Dunster was ousted for refusing to baptize his infant son in favor of adult baptism. Harvard’s 17th century presidents were Puritan clergy, and perhaps the most insidious was the sixth president Increase Mather who received Harvard’s first doctorate. His book on witchcraft fueled the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.
Against secularizing Harvard College, the divinity school was founded in 1816 as Harvard’s second professional school after the medical school. Its early iconoclast was Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose commencement address to the divinity graduates of 1838 remains a classic: “Europe has always owed to oriental genius its divine impulses,” preached the Unitarian minister, who would become a persona non grata at Harvard for rejecting the divinity of Jesus.
In the 1880s, Harvard’s longest-serving chief Charles Eliot jettisoned the compulsory morning chapel. With the construction of the Widener Library, Eliot’s successor Lawrence Lowell globalized Harvard beyond the Boston Brahmin. After World War I, Lowell also built the Memorial Church to face a widow’s titanic temple for her son.
Lowell’s successor James Conant served in World War I as a chemist developing poison gases. During World War II, Conant witnessed the first atomic experiment. A pragmatic man who quipped divinity school “the weakest of Harvard’s professional components,” Conant unsuccessfully tried to transfer the bankrupt divinity school to Oberlin College.
Religiosity waxed and waned among the Harvard honchos, and Conant’s successor, Nathan Pusey, was a devout Episcopalian who resented the secular ethos of the 1960s. His professors, however, had more capacious conceptions of God. “God is just as present in the secular as the religious realms of life," wrote theologian Harvey Cox in his 1965 bestseller “The Secular City.”
"Turn on – find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God, your own body. Go out of your mind. Get high. Tune in – be reborn," was the motto of psychologist Timothy Leary who ran the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Although Harvard fired him in 1963 for egging his students onto psychedelics, one guinea pig, Huston Smith, became a towering scholar of religion.
Back in kaleidoscopic Annenberg built in a cruciform structure, the latest addition is the marble bust of W. E. B. Du Bois commissioned in 1993 for the first African American to receive a doctorate from Harvard in 1895. “I was in Harvard, not of it,” he wrote during the Jim Crow era of segregation. “I believe in God, who made of one blood all nations.”
If the God of Harvard, Emerson, and Du Bois seem alien to you, consider knocking on the doors of more than thirty university chaplains who represent the smorgasbord of faiths from Atheism to Zoroastrianism. If the sins of religions seem to eclipse their merits, chart your own spiritual path for truth and wisdom. And if the College gives you grapes rather than gold, come make wine at the divinity school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The famous maxim that “the ends justify the means” has long been associated with the philosophy of Machiavelli. It seems that recently, a number of Harvard Law School students — of all people — have taken up the same mantle.
Around two weeks ago, dozens of Law School students disrupted a recruitment event by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. The reason? Paul Weiss had recently provided legal representation to the oil and gas company ExxonMobil in New York state court. The students demanded that if the firm wants to recruit them, it must “drop Exxon,” and held a banner to the same effect. They chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, ExxonMobil’s got to go.”
Though the chants were catchy, it seems the most charitable explanation for the students’ behavior is that they fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of a lawyer. They ignore the lawyer’s role in a legal system designed to be based on facts and not on prevailing public sentiment.
It goes without saying that my view of the threat posed by carbon emissions is likely identical with the view of these students; moreover, I have no stake in Exxon or its success. Yet, the students’ demand for less representation in the legal system is exactly the wrong way to go about effecting the results we want to see.
A defense attorney’s job, an issue that I’ve written about before, is to advocate for a client — paid or unpaid, public or private — within a court of law. It is very serious to level a legal allegation against someone else in this country. In a criminal case, a conviction can result in a person’s removal from free society. In a civil case, the penalty is monetary, and often a very substantial amount.
The reason we have an adversarial legal system is to ensure that such punishment is not rendered without the allegation’s being airtight enough to meet the appropriate burden of proof. Though there is no right to counsel in civil cases (meaning that the government does not need to appoint an attorney for a party), a lawyer unquestionably helps to make this process more airtight. And the process here matters far more than the result. The central proposition of the system is that the correct judgment, according to existing laws, will naturally follow if the procedure is sound.
For some, this work may not seem sexy. But the representation provided by law firms like Paul Weiss is more than profitable; it is important to our society, particularly when a defense attorney may be the only one preventing abuse of power by the government, which is the antithesis of our legal system.
In the Exxon case, the New York state government had sought a penalty of $1.6 billion and charged Exxon with securities fraud, relating to how the company was disclosing costs of environmental regulation to its shareholders. The New York State Supreme Court judge ruled against the government, and made it clear in his opinion that “the testimony of the expert witnesses called by the Office of the Attorney General was eviscerated on cross-examination.” Without such a vigorous defense, the state government may very well have won on weak evidence.
In providing such representation, Paul Weiss is not defending climate change. It is defending the law. The legal profession does not exist to pass moral judgment on a client, but to uphold the process. Indeed, as the judge wrote, “Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change,” as “this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case.”
We should all support the vigorous passage of legislation to combat climate change, but that is not what these Law School students have advocated for. Their perfect world would have us essentially substitute the policymaking process with the cartel-like, collective denial of representation for certain entities: the Office of the Attorney General may have good lawyers, but Exxon must not.
Now, their inevitable response would be that representation is already unequal within our courts, so docking some representation from Exxon isn’t all that important. But this is incredibly naive. Does the legal system need to ensure better representation for, say, individuals who are too poor to afford representation in criminal trials? Of course. But wanting to improve the process for some shouldn’t lead us to deny the same protections to others. And that is what such public shaming does; it makes the unwise demand for less representation, without realizing that abuse of the process (even against large corporations) hurts the system at large.
I rarely weigh in on events of other schools within Harvard, because the decisions made within those particular institutions usually have little effect outside of their own student bodies. This case is different, however, because the ideology that these Law School students hold about our legal system is damaging for all of us.
If they don’t care about the means, and worry only about the end, they shouldn’t pretend to be lawyers. Perhaps they would be better suited as legislators; the Kennedy School is only a short walk away. But if they continue as members of the legal profession, they are gradually sawing off the very branch upon which they sit. Indeed, they are sawing off the branch upon which we all sit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Connecticut judge dismissed all charges Monday against ten Harvard students and alumni who participated in a November divestment demonstration at the Harvard-Yale football game, according to Hugh F. Keefe, the students’ lawyer.
Police arrested the protesters in November, after dozens of activists and hundreds of spectators stormed the field at halftime during the 136th edition of the Harvard-Yale football game. Staging a 30-minute sit-in, they unfurled large banners calling on Harvard and Yale to divest their multi-billion dollar endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt, and several refused to leave the field until police placed them under arrest.
At a Dec. 6 hearing, the judge, Phillip Scarpellino, asked the students and alumni to complete community service and return to New Haven, Conn. for Monday's court date.
On Monday — the first day of classes for College students — the protestors traveled to New Haven to fulfill the judge’s orders. At the hearing, their case was annulled, legally erasing any record of their arrest.
Keefe represented the Harvard students arrested during the divestment protest alongside attorney Tara Knight. In an interview Monday, Keefe said he received the outcome he had originally hoped for.
“The disposition I was hoping for would be one where there was no record of any kind,” he said. “I was successful in doing that.”
Divest Harvard declined to comment for this article. Fossil Free Yale also declined to comment.
Now that the charges are void, the protesters will be able to say that they have never been arrested under Connecticut law, according to Keefe.
“Many of these people are seniors and juniors looking for spots in graduate school and jobs,” Keefe said. “It’s very important that we keep their records clean for that purpose.”
The protestors' arrests were set into motion when they refused to vacate the field even as the announcer and police asked them to leave, choosing to exit only after police placed them under arrest. In total, police charged 50 people with disorderly conduct from the demonstration.
At the Dec. 6 hearing, Scarpellino ordered the arrested protesters to complete five hours of community service and commit no additional offenses before the charges were formally dismissed Monday. All of the arrested protesters in the courtroom said that they agreed to the terms at the time.
Though the protestors were not required to fulfill their community service locally, Scarpellino strongly recommended that students do so with Project Green Thumb, an alternative to paying fines for some offenses in New Haven. The project helps clean up New Haven Green, a public space in the center of the city.
Keefe — who said that he has represented Yale students for years in cases involving protests — said he decided to represent the protesters because he believed in what they were doing.
“I was happy to represent the students — they’re always fun,” he said. “They’re very nice people — and they happen to be dead right on the issue of climate change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blue skies and crowded lecture halls welcomed students back to campus as they shopped classes on Monday, marking the first day of the spring semester.
Across campus, students sampled classes including the perennially popular Economics 10b: “Principles of Macroeconomics.”
This academic term also marks the beginning of a new General Education lottery process. Instead of individual lotteries coordinated by each course, the new system features a centralized ranked-choice lottery run by the Gen Ed office.
Ayana M. Yaegashi ’23 was one of the lucky few to claim a seat in Gen Ed 1051: “Reclaiming Argument: Logic as a Force for Good,” taught by Philosophy Department Chair Edward J. Hall. It meets in Harvard Hall, which recently reopened following half a year of renovations.
“I want to take it because it would be cool to be able to dissect arguments,” Yaegashi said. “It’s kind of interesting to know formal logic, because you always think about it and we all have some sort of instinct for it.”
In many cases, classes were filled to the brim, leaving people to claim any space they could, including in aisles and on windowsills.
An overflowing student body welcomed Economics 50: “Using Big Data to Solve Social and Economic Problems” to Sanders Theater. Oscar L. Berry ’23 witnessed the overcrowding for the newly-renamed course, taught by Economics Professsor Raj Chetty ’00.
“I was physically uncomfortable. We had to move down on our little bench because there were so many people there,” Berry said. “There were more people there than there were in Ec 10b, and I think that’s the measure for a packed room.”
Some professors spent their lectures doing more than presenting syllabi. Physical Science 11: “Foundations and Frontiers of Modern Chemistry” decided to play with fire.
“They showed a lot of experiments on the way just to prove that the class is going to remain interesting,” Michael L. Zhang ’‘23 said. “He held a candle up to two balloons, and because of the flames, the balloons would explode. I had decided to take the class already, but experiments are always cool.”
Students do not finalize course selections until Friday, giving them the opportunity to casually survey classes for themselves before the deadline.
After shopping Computer Science 124: “Data Structures and Algorithms,” Katherine F. Zhang ’23 found a valuable course to add to her schedule.
“I’m excited to see computer science from a more abstract and theoretical perspective because that’s not something that I’ve really done before,” she said.
Others, like Derek N. Zheng ’23, had different thoughts about the first lecture.
“We just spent an entire lecture learning about coin flipping,” he said.

Two incidents of assault and battery were reported on campus near the river houses Saturday, according to the Harvard University Police Department log.
At 10:27 a.m., HUPD officers were dispatched to respond to an assault and battery report at the Malkin Athletic Center. Twelve hours later, officers took a report of an assault and battery at Adams House.
Both cases are open for further investigation, according to the department’s police log. HUPD did not release any information suggesting that the two assaults Saturday were related.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano could not immediately be reached for comment.
The pair of incidents do not mark the first time HUPD has investigated an assault near the river houses. In February 2013, an assault was reported in Quincy House, where a female undergraduate was grabbed by two males attempting to pull her towards another building. In December 2018, police investigated the “indecent assault” of a female, also near Quincy House on Plympton Street.
After the incident in 2018, Catalano sent an email about the assault to Harvard affiliates. He advised affiliates against talking on cell phones, listening to music, or “walking too close to persons unnecessarily.”
“Community members should be vigilant while walking throughout campus and surrounding areas both during the day and at night and to take the appropriate precautions,” he wrote.

The Middle East — a landmark nightclub and restaurant on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Brookline Street in Central Square — was put up for sale last week, co-owner Nabil Sater told Cambridge Day last Sunday.
The 23,388-square-foot restaurant, which boasts five adjacent dining and live music venues, is reportedly listed at $40 million, per Cambridge Day. The establishment began as a Lebanese restaurant in 1969 and featured belly-dancing and live performances.
Brothers Nabil and Joseph Sater purchased the sprawling property in 2014 for $7.1 million. Sater told Cambridge Day he regularly worked 100-hour-plus weeks to pay off its high mortgage installments.
“It’s been tough,” Nabil told Cambridge Day.
Business at The Middle East first began to stall when politics throughout the geographic Middle East raised concerns among patrons in Cambridge, Cambridge Day reported.
In 2013, the brothers considered a plan to build several floors of condos above the restaurant in response to mounting financial insecurity.
“The landlord wants to sell the building, and we have to do something,” Joseph told Cambridge Day in 2013. “I don’t want to give up.”
Then, in 2018, the business faced backlash from musical groups slated to perform at the nightclub after Joseph faced a series of sexual misconduct allegations levied against him online. Joseph resigned, though the club's owners wrote in a Facebook post at the time that the allegations were "unequivocally" false.
Hunneman commercial brokers told Cambridge Day that information about The Middle East's listing has not been posted online, but has been sent to some 5,000 contacts.
The club's management wrote on Facebook Thursday that The Middle East will remain open throughout the sale process, adding that the nightclub is "here to stay." Nabil told Cambridge Day he hopes a future lease-back arrangement will keep the business alive.
Michael Monestime, executive director of the Central Square Business Improvement District, described the loss of The Middle East as “unthinkable” in an interview with Cambridge Day.
“The Middle East has become the heart and soul of Central Square,” Monestime said. “The Saters have run that corner at Brookline Street and Massachusetts Avenue like the living room of their home – where guests come in and feel welcome and invited.”

Seven members of Cambridge’s state legislative delegation endorsed incumbent United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) in his re-election campaign Saturday.
Markey, who is running in a close Democratic primary race against U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), holds the endorsement of every Cambridge state legislator except for State Representative Joseph A. Boncore, who supports Kennedy.
“It was not a hard decision,” state Senator Patricia D. Jehlen said. “He’s been an extremely effective and outstanding leader on things that I care about.”
Markey and Kennedy both made their pitches to Cambridge Democrats at an event on Sunday at the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.
“I’m honored to have the delegation endorsing me,” Markey said in an interview after the event. “This is obviously at the heart of the progressive movement in Massachusetts and in the whole country, and so to have their voices — to have their support — just is an incredible validation of what I work on and the fights that I fight.”
Kennedy, who has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2013, picked up the endorsement of several high-profile members of Congress earlier this month, including Representative John R. Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights leader who delivered Harvard’s commencement address in 2018.
Markey also has the backing of his chamber’s national leaders — namely Democratic presidential candidate and senior senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.). Markey also earned a coveted endorsement from progressive firebrand Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
Jehlen, who has served in the state Senate since 2005, said Kennedy has not persuaded her to support him over Markey.
“I haven’t heard a compelling argument to change from what I consider very effective, experienced leadership,” she said.
Jehlen also said she doesn’t hear about the Senate primary often from her constituents.
“I don’t hear enough talk about it. I think people are more focused on Washington,” she said. “[Markey is] not somebody that is always in the headlines, so I think people are gradually learning what he’s been doing all these years and I think there’s a lot of support.”
Jehlen, who was joined in endorsing Markey by fellow state Senator Sal N. DiDomenico, as well as state Representatives Michael Connolly, Marjorie C. Decker, Jonathan Hecht, Jay D. Livingstone, and David M. Rogers, said she believes Markey has a valuable voice in for Democrats in Washington.
“We should not lose his extremely effective leadership, his experience, his relationships, and his knowledge,” Jehlen said.

Over $6,000 worth of electronics were stolen from the Dillon Fieldhouse in Allston, according to a report filed by the Harvard University Police Department Thursday.
The Dillon Fieldhouse — an athletic facility in Allston — houses the locker rooms for football, field hockey, baseball, men’s and women’s soccer, and men’s and women’s lacrosse. The Harvard Varsity Equipment Room, Sports Medicine Facility, and several varsity coaches’ offices are also located in the Fieldhouse.
HUPD officials reported the theft could have taken place at any time between Friday, Jan. 17 and Wednesday, Jan. 22.
“Officer dispatched to take a report of the theft of eleven iPads valued at $5,819.00, four phone chargers valued at $80.00, and twelve iPad chargers valued at $240.00,” the HUPD police log reads.
The HUPD police log did not state which athletic team or person was the owner of these electronics.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the open investigation.
Coaches from the baseball, football, and men’s and women’s lacrosse teams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The burglary comes more than a decade after a series of thefts from athletic facilities in October 2009, when four Harvard athletic teams reported iPods, laptops, and other valuables gone missing. In two separate instances, close to $4,500 and over $2,000 worth of personal items were stolen from the women’s soccer and softball locker rooms, and from the men’s water polo locker room, respectively.
Thieves have also targeted student dorms over the past few years. In September 2016, ten laptops — together worth thousands of dollars — were stolen from dorm rooms in Harvard Yard and from some of the upperclassman river houses. Two separate burglaries of freshman dorms also occurred in the span of two weeks in September 2018. In March of last year, a student at the College alleged that he was robbed of his Apple AirPods in the Yard.
In a Crimson data analysis of crimes reported by HUPD in 2017, reports were generally concentrated around the Charles River and Harvard Square. The analysis also found that theft was the most commonly occurring type of crime.

The Cambridge City Council adopted a motion to convene further meetings surrounding an ordinance to ban natural gas in the city Monday night.
The proposed municipal ordinance, titled “Prohibition of Natural Gas Infrastructure in New Buildings,” would bar developers from installing fuel gas piping during the construction of new buildings in Cambridge. The ordinance would provide a public interest exemption, allowing for some new buildings, such as hospitals, to continue to use natural gas. It would also provide an exemption for buildings in which gas-free infrastructure is not technologically feasible.
Berkeley, Calif. and Brookline, Mass. adopted similar measures in September and November, respectively.
The ordinance received widespread support from Cambridge residents during the public comment session at Monday’s city council meeting.
Cambridge resident Ian Evans spoke about the urgency with which he believes the city must act to combat climate change, adding that he thinks passing the ban is a step toward doing so.
“I’m here to support the natural gas ban,” he said. “I am thirty years old, I will live to see some pretty horrific things. We have heard that a lot of what is happening now is the new normal — that’s not true. It’s going to be crisis after crisis in the future, and it’s just the beginning.”
“This natural gas ban is a really small step, but it is a really important one. It has to happen in order for things to move forward,” Evans added.
Eric D. Grunebaum ’84, a Cambridge resident, also backed the new ordinance in his public comment.
“I think the technology is ready, and we can do this,” he said. “Natural gas is not a bridge to the future, it’s a tether to the past.”
Despite support from residents, the approved motion puts the ordinance on hold. City councilors plan to engage in discussions with stakeholders — Cambridge workers, institutions, and the general public — before pursuing further legislative action regarding natural gas regulation.
During the meeting, city councilor and former Cambridge mayor Marc C. McGovern pointed to what he called a lack of discussion on the issue of natural gas.
“Process matters,” McGovern said. “One or two public meetings on something this significant doesn’t feel quite right to me.”
Vice Mayor Allana M. Mallon said she believes the council is “missing that coalition factor with front-line communities,” and called on the mayor and city manager to “use this issue as an opportunity to form that type of green justice coalition that outlines a Green New Deal.”
McGovern also stressed the importance of having additional meetings to build support for the ordinance, especially from Cambridge businesses and local universities such as MIT and Harvard.
“We want to make sure we pass something that has greater support, reduces the likelihood of litigation, and is meaningful to get us where we want to be,” McGovern said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine graduate and undergraduate student activist organizations gathered in the lobby of the Science Center to hold a “Reorientation Rally” on Monday, the first day of spring semester classes.
The Reorientation Rally — which took its name from a play on orientation for classes — was organized by Act on a Dream, Divest Harvard, Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Harvard ReproJustice Action & Dialogue, Harvard TPS Coalition, Our Harvard Can Do Better, and Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee. The rally featured speeches from each of the groups.
In a printed statement distributed during the rally, the groups wrote that the rally’s various participants shared a common interest in fighting for social justice on campus.
“Today, we joined together to disrupt business as usual in the Science Center and held a Reorientation Rally,” the statement reads. “We welcomed our community back to the reality of a campus plagued by administrative inertia on many of the most critical issues we face, from denial of rights to Harvard’s student workers and the historical absence of an Ethnic Studies department, to the Harvard Corporation’s continued investment in the fossil fuel and prison industries.”
The statement concludes with a declaration that the groups will continue their activism over the next few weeks.
“There is no time for inaction,” the statement continued. “Today is only the beginning. So, we are calling on every Harvard student, worker, and faculty member to join us in this fight. We cannot win without you.”
Connor Chung ’23 spoke on behalf of Divest Harvard and criticized Harvard Management Company’s decision to invest in avocados and sell other natural resources amid wildfires around the world.
“We’re facing a planet on fire and rather than fight the flames, Harvard spent its winter break investing in avocado monopolies,” Chung said. “Any solutions must recognize that the way we’ve always done things isn’t nearly enough to dismantle this immoral status quo.”
In November, demonstrators from Divest Harvard and Fossil Free Yale occupied the field at halftime of the 136th edition of The Game, demanding that Harvard and Yale divest from the fossil fuel industry and from Puerto Rican debt.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, referring to a previous statement, wrote that the University agrees with the urgency of climate change but disagrees with divestment activists “on the means by which a university should confront it.”
“Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed,” Newton wrote.
Ana C. Gonzalez Valdes, a graduate student studying Earth and Planetary Sciences and a HGSU-UAW member, said that the union is continuing to work on securing a contract.
“We’re going to continue to organize so that we can get a contract with protections against harassment and discrimiantion,” Gonzalez Valdes said.
Gonzalez Valdes said the Union is standing in solidarity with the undergraduate groups because they stood with them during their strike.
In December, HGSU-UAW maintained a nearly month-long strike marching on campus after more than a year of negotiations with school officials. Hundreds of students and supporters joined the picket line throughout the strike.
Newton wrote in an email to The Crimson that the University “remains committed to addressing concerns raised during these ongoing negotiations and is hopeful the mediation process currently underway will help resolve differences that remain between the two sides.”
At the close of the rally, protesters marched to the John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard, bearing homemade signs with slogans like “Want Diversity? Teach Our Histories!” and chanting, “We’ll be back! We’ll be back! We’ll be back!”
