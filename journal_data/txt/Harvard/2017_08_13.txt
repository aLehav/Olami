After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is the first episode in season seven that actually feels like a “Game of Thrones” episode. While the previous three meandered around like they had time to waste (We only have so much screentime left! Every moment is precious!), “The Spoils of War” was filled with fire and blood.
Before the violence, there’s a bit of unproductive sibling rivalry. Arya and Sansa are finally reunited in the most fitting setting—in front of their father’s statue in the Crypt of Winterfell. But splits in their relationship begin to emerge very quickly. “I remember how happy [Jon] was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop,” Sansa says to Arya, with a slight tinge of jealousy in her voice. Later: “Your list?” “Of people I’m going to kill,” Arya calmly replies. Nervous laughter ensues.
The Stark family’s happy reunion is marred by the fact that Bran and Arya are totally different—but highly skilled—people. Arya is no longer an aspiring master assassin—she is a master assassin. And Bran has visions and tells people weirdly personal details about their pasts. Sansa is slowly learning about these developments, and by the look on her face as she watches Arya dance around a master swordswoman like Brienne, she doesn’t seem to be liking these changes.
Turning Sansa into an unhappy, jealous teen though, seems like such a waste of her character arc. We know that Sansa is capable of more than sulking about her family’s newfound power in the midst of war. We’ve seen her survive Cersei and Joffrey, we’ve seen her escape Ramsay, and we’ve seen her tread carefully around Littlefinger as she fortifies Winterfell. So I hope that the writers don’t introduce a plotline where Sansa’s jealousy gets in the way of both her character growth and her family’s relationships. It would seem like unnecessary drama for a show like “Game of Thrones.”
The other Stark (Targaryen?) is unfortunately missing out. Jon Snow is still trying to persuade Daenerys to lend her dragons and army for the upcoming battle against the White Walkers. He finds a few cave paintings made by the Children of the Forest illustrating their previous battle with the dead. But aside from adding some ambience to whole situation, it’s pretty useless. Daenerys tells Jon to bend the knee, and he’s left with zero dragons.
And also an unfulfilled romance? It’s clear at this point that the writers are planning for Jon and Daenerys to fall in love, but I’m not sure if it will be for the good of the show. Minor incest subplot aside, Jon and Daenerys don’t have much chemistry. At least, not compared to Jon and Ygritte, who was killed in season four. All that’s happening between them right now are negotiations, which just aren’t that interesting.
Not according to Ser Davos though, who clearly ships them. “I saw you staring at her good heart,” he teases. I hope that his character isn’t reduced to a shipper who occasionally offers comedic relief, because Ser Davos has gone through too much grief with the Baratheons for his character to suffer like that.
But while Ser Davos’s character development and the feeble romance between Jon and Daenerys falter, Theon’s arrival to Dragonstone presents a much more interesting arc. Jon clearly wants Theon dead but restrains himself. Theon’s actor, Alfie Allen, is perfect in this scene. His shoulders are stiff when he approaches Jon, and he stutters when he says Sansa’s name, capturing both the awkwardness and the emotional weight his guilt must be giving.
While this exchange goes on, Daenerys is flying west. She’s clearly tired of losing a war she was so well prepared for, and wreaks havoc on Jaime’s soldiers and stolen supplies with dragonfire and the Dothraki. “Game of Thrones” has always done their battle scenes well, each one a chaotic flurry of limbs and horses. This one is no exception. It’s so satisfying seeing the Dothraki riding through the fields, somewhat cheerfully yelling and swinging their weapons. They’re almost elegant compared to the Lannister army and their clunky armor.
Daenerys isn’t holding back in this ambush, and neither is Drogon. But they might have to when Bronn wheels out Qyburn’s overglorified crossbow. Drogon gets shot, adding another stake to the field—now strategy can’t be as simple as “Ride in with dragons and burn all enemies.” Now the war gets even more complicated.
Especially with two Lannister brothers on different sides of the same battlefield. As Jaime rides towards Daenerys with a spear in hand, intending to kill, Tyrion mutters “Flee, you idiot.” It’s difficult to know who to root for—and who the characters are rooting for. And that emotional complexity—the desperation for Daenerys to win, for Jaime to survive—is what makes this episode succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s difficult to put into words what exactly “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice” did right, but it’s not hard to say that Ninja Theory (of “DmC: Devil May Cry” and “Heavenly Sword” fame) has outdone themselves with their latest game. From the very beginning, the player is pulled into the main character’s—Senua’s—world, and the game doesn’t let go of your attention until the end.
First, a bit of background. Last week, I conducted an interview with Dominic Matthews, Product Development Manager at Ninja Theory. In it, we briefly discussed the game’s most controversial design decision: Senua’s psychosis. He informed me that the voices she hears—which the player hears as well—were all recorded binaurally, meaning that users wearing headphones can place them in three-dimensional space. I didn’t expect this feature to be as striking as it proved to be, but it creates an experience which I can say without reservation is unlike anything I’ve ever come across before.
The voices become an integral part of the narrative and the game experience as a whole, so much that their absence in certain parts is jarring. Senua herself speaks very little throughout the game, but the voices are almost constantly commenting on what’s happening: whether it’s about the player’s current environment, support, abuse, or narrative commentary on Senua’s life and history, you almost never get a moment of silence.
Their role extends into the game’s mechanics as well. The voices take the role of a user interface, which “Hellblade” has eschewed in favor of promoting an unbroken cinematic experience for the player. I was skeptical when Matthews mentioned the lack of user interface in our interview, but I quickly realized that the Ninja Theory team knew what it was doing. Visual and auditory hints create an intuitive sense of what the player has to do in almost every situation, rendering a traditional user interface—things like a health bar, compass, map, etc—entirely unnecessary. It’s a subtle thing, but demonstrates incredible attention to detail and certainly a testament to the skill of the industry veterans at Ninja Theory
As Matthews said, it creates a more cinematic experience, and what a cinema “Hellblade” is. During the seamless cutscenes rendered in real time, the player’s camera often shifts until Senua directly addresses the player, speaking to the voices. In a way, you are just another one of the voices in her head, telling her what to do, observing her journey, a relationship the game isn’t shy about driving home. It creates a highly personal experience for the player, aided by some truly remarkable graphical detail and animation work. Hearing the voices in her head as if I were hearing them, then being addressed by Senua herself, brought me into the story in a way I’ve never experienced in a video game before. It was a sustained intimacy. If the player is addressed directly, it’s often not woven into the very fabric of the gameplay. But the master weavers at “Hellblade” did just that, and it works wonders.
That said, the lack of user interface did cause me grief occasionally. On encountering my first ladder, I wandered around for a bit before quickly consulting the options menu to discover that I needed to use the ‘F’ key to interact. There are no on-screen prompts in the way that games normally display first-time instructions, so while I appreciate the attempt to maintain the player’s immersion, it forced me to break entirely from the experience, albeit momentarily. This also occurred the first time I fought multiple enemies (a word on combat next) and nearly died because I couldn’t figure out how to switch focus on enemies. Again, this was not a problem for the rest of the game, but in these moments it was frustrating. A moment of on-screen guidance would have been welcome.
The second of the game’s three design ‘pillars’—exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat—is implemented in a really creative way. The puzzles take on the characteristics of the boss for whatever level they’re in. Every area involves finding the shape of Viking runes in the environment. With the aid of a few visual cues this process is usually more fun than frustrating, but it’s the regional differences that add a bit of flavor to each area. When you’re tracking down Hellblade’s god of illusion, Valravn, puzzles are about seeing through illusions to the truth beneath. When you turn your attention to Surt, a fire giant, puzzles involve making your way through a flaming maze. Each area fits snugly into place as the game builds its aesthetic, the puzzles presenting an interesting meta-commentary on what in the player’s experience is real, what is the game’s fiction, and what is Senua’s fiction within that reality.
The combat design in “Hellblade” is really quite good for a game of this size. Senua’s moveset is combo-based and fairly limited, but the complexity of the system comes in her combinations. There are about seven enemy types, all with their own attack patterns and consequent strategies to defeat them. Senua’s dodges can be incorporated into combos. Her blocks can stagger an opponent and open them up for attacks, and her kicks can stun enemies or break a block. Other moves include a sprint attack and genre-standard light and heavy attacks. The player also builds Focus while dodging or performing combos, which they can use to reveal enemies who are cloaked in shadows to expose them to normal attacks. Focusing slows time around Senua, allowing her to deal an incredible amount of damage or—as I more often used it—to escape from precarious positions. There aren’t a huge number of combos, and it seems the only way to learn them is to experiment with different combinations and timings of attacks. Despite the small moveset, combat is truly gripping and, for the most part, fair. Every enemy, from the basic warrior you first encounter to the hulking monsters which come later, can kill you if you’re not almost constantly dodging, blocking, and carefully maneuvering to avoid being surrounded. It's tense, brutal, and oh so satisfying.
If you do let yourself get surrounded, death comes quickly. This is not a game which is kind to players with a lack of foresight. Luckily, death isn’t permanent in “Hellblade.” At least, not at first. Upon player death, you respawn at the latest checkpoint. At the beginning of the game, however, Senua is cursed by the goddess Hela, queen of the underworld, with rot. Every time you die, the rot becomes worse. If it reaches your head, the seat of the soul in Celtic and Norse mythologies, you lose and have to start the game over. I didn’t die enough for this to be an issue, but the threat of a save-wiping death lurked as an ever-present fear. How many deaths is too many, especially when narrative events periodically advanced the spread of the rot? It made each combat arena, and each death, a nerve-wracking event, and gave the whole game a much more serious vibe than one with infinite lives.
Contributing to that vibe is the ever-present lurking of the darkness, which seems to be a manifestation of the evil against which she struggles. The darkness is mostly present in fleeting glimpses—shifting shadows flitting across what should be brightly lit stone, or concealing your enemies from you—but is later personified as a deep, inhuman voice. As you play through the game, it becomes clear that the darkness is not just a force of evil, at least not entirely. It is a physicalization of the darkness inside of her. All of her fears, all of her regrets, all of the abuse she’s suffered; it all comes together to become the darkness, and becomes a character in its own right.
Between the truly stunning implementation of the voices which plague Senua, the game’s stellar artistic design, and the primal Norse-styled music, the game accomplishes what it sets out to do with flying colors. The combat is satisfying, the narrative is gripping, and the art is stunning. Before you buy it, though, you should know: The game is short. I completed “Hellblade” the same day I got my review key. Steam’s game-time counter says it took me six hours. Since I wasn’t timing it myself, I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was almost seven (Steam counts by the hour, so it could have been six hours and fifty-nine minutes). For a thirty dollar game, it’s a bit on the short side, particularly for a game with essentially no replayability value. But the dollar-to-hour ratio is still better than a matinee screening at most theaters, and honestly, the quality of the experience makes up for its relatively short length. “Hellblade” is not a game for everyone. That’s not what it’s trying to be. It’s a great single-player experience that you might not want to play again after you beat it, but it’s a hell of a time while you’re on that first run. If you’ve got the cash and you’re looking for a unique narrative experience, I can wholeheartedly recommend that you seriously consider picking up Ninja Theory’s “Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice.”

The countdown to the start of the fall semester has officially begun: Back-to-school ads are making the rounds, sweaters are on full display, and twin XL duvet covers are selling out at Target. You could wallow in your end-of-summer-blues, or you could make the most of these last few weeks. Flyby suggests the latter, and that’s why we’ve compiled yet another list of school-free summer activities to help keep your mind off of the impending doom of September.
Relax at Singing Beach
Any day (or every day?) | Singing Beach, Manchester-by-the-Sea (Red Line to Green Line C train to North Station, then take the Newbury/Rockport Commuter Rail to Manchester)
Chances are you’ve been so busy balancing summer work, sleep, and all of Flyby’s weekly activities that you haven’t even gone to the beach this summer. Well, lucky for you, Massachusetts is located on the eastern seaboard, so beaches are aplenty! One of the nicest, closest beaches to Harvard is Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea (yeah, the town in the movie is a real, live place). It takes about an hour and a half to get to this quintessential New England beach town, complete with ice cream parlors and mini-marts perfect for picking up snacks and sunscreen before heading to the beach.
The Commuter Rail ride takes a little less than an hour, and it’s about a ten-minute walk from the Manchester stop to the actual beach. A round trip ticket on the Commuter Rail is about $23 (or $10 if you have a valid student CharlieCard), and it costs $5 to get onto Singing Beach. You could leave North Station as early as 6:40 a.m., and the last train back to Boston from Manchester runs as late as 10:50 p.m.
$28 for 14 hours of sunbathing? Sounds like a pretty good deal.
Book swap in Boston 
Wednesday, 7 p.m. | Trident Booksellers and Cafe (1 bus from Mass. Ave. @ Holyoke St. to Hynes Convention Center)
You know what they say—one person’s trash is another person’s (summer reading) treasure. This Wednesday, bring one to five books that you don’t want anymore to Trident Booksellers and trade them with fellow book swap attendees. The idea is that you take home as many books as you came with, so you’re guaranteed to leave with something new to read.
ImprovBoston’s “Comedy Lottery” show
Wednesday, 10 p.m. | ImprovBoston (Red Line to Central Square, or walk)
The only thing funnier than quality comedy? Horrendous stand-up performances. Luckily, at ImprovBoston’s “Comedy Lottery” show, there’s a chance you’ll get to see both. Located right in Central Square, ImprovBoston is one of Boston’s best comedy clubs. Every Wednesday, they host the Comedy Lottery, when anyone—from experienced pros to knock-knock-joke-tellers—has the chance to perform stand-up. If you want to enter your name in the lottery for a performance slot, get there any time after 6:30 p.m., drop your name into a hat, have some sort of bit prepared (hopefully), and pray that you’re among the chosen. Or, head to the studio just to watch some of the up and coming comedians of Cambridge (and witness any monumental comedic fails). Admission is free.
“Third Thursdays” at the Gardner Museum
Thursday, 5:30-9 p.m. | Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum (Red Line to Green Line E train to Longwood, then walk)
All summer we’ve been reminding you to visit the Gardner Museum. In case you still haven’t—or even if you have—we’re going to give it one more shot. This week, the museum is hosting “Third Thursdays: Dog Days of Summer.” Stop by the museum, which is open late on Thursdays, for a canine-themed evening in the galleries. There will be activities, music, and a cash bar around the Gardner’s beautiful courtyard. Harvard students can get free tickets to the museum and event if they bring their student IDs, but Third Thursday tickets often sell out, so plan ahead!
Joni Mitchell Festival at the Beat Brasserie
Thursday, from 8 p.m. until 12 a.m. | The Beat Brasserie in Harvard Square
For some live music and good food, stop by the Beat Brasserie this Thursday. A handful of artists will be covering (and reimagining) songs by the 1960s singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell for the restaurant’s third annual festival in her honor. Best part is, you don’t even have to take a Big Yellow Taxi to get to this event—it’s right in your backyard.
Fiction Fridays at Harvard Book Store Friday, from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m. | Harvard Book Store
You only have a few weeks left before essays and academic journals fill up your reading list for months on end and all novels are pushed to the side. Thankfully, Harvard Book Store’s Fiction Fridays will continue for the last few weeks of the summer, meaning you can get 15 percent off on anything from poetry to audiobooks. Never read “Harry Potter”? “The Hunger Games”? Want to read every single Nicholas Sparks book (again)? That’s fine, we don’t judge. Fiction Fridays end September 1st, though, so take advantage of Black Friday’s summer counterpart (minus the stampedes and brawls) before it’s too late.
“Grease” outdoor screening Saturday, 7 p.m. | West End of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace (Red Line to Park Street, then walk)
Tell me more, tell me more, like is it really free? Yes, that’s right—this Saturday, head into Boston for a free outdoor screening of Grease. Grab some food at Quincy Market beforehand and fuel up for a night of singing and dancing along with Sandy and Danny.
SoWa Open Market Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. | 460 Harrison Ave., Boston (Red Line to Broadway, then walk)
Complete with farm fresh groceries and snacks, handmade goods from local artists, an extensive vintage market, and a whole fleet of food trucks, the SoWa Open Market pretty much has it all. It couldn’t be easier to get there by train, and once you arrive, shopping, eating, and browsing options abound. The chance to stop by surrounding art studios and galleries guarantees that a trip to SoWa is an artsy-adventurous way to spend your weekend.
