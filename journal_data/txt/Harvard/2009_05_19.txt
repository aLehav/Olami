After a frightening shooting in Kirkland, FlyBy thought the police blotter might be taking it easy for the rest of the night.  Not so.  According to a FlyBy correspondent, around 11:45 p.m., HUPD and Cambridge police officers handcuffed a male wearing a hooded sweatshirt on the Mt. Auburn side of Quincy House.  A flashlight search was conducted (for what? we don't know.)  One Quincy-open contributor said that she had gotten the scoop from the cops (after the jump):
But after several minutes in cuffs, the sweatshirt-wearing detainee was released.  Our FlyBy correspondent couldn't catch up with him to get his side of the story, and the police weren't talking.  Keep an eye on thecrimson.com tomorrow for updates.

At 5:02pm, just minutes before the news broke of the tragic shooting of Justin Cosby, Dean Evelynn Hammonds sent out a reasonably important email:
That's karma for you.  The Administrators tried to bury the budget cuts underneath a pile of lecture slides and study guides, only to have their responsiveness and care for the students, etc., buried by the news cycle.
But the administration is reviewing their most panned decision, and if it wasn't for shootings,  robberies, and swine flu, this would be quite the cause for celebration.  All the angst and anger worked.  As Hammonds stated:
FlyBy wants to implore all of you to keep up the good fight.  Today, at 5:15 student group leaders have organized a protest outside of  University Hall to call for more transparency and inclusion in the budget cutting process.  Don't forget, there are still 143 million more dollars that need to be cut.  Go!
