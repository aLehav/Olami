After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Susan Minot’s latest book, “Thirty Girls,” is a fast-paced, psychologically haunting narration of two transformative journeys that converge in war-torn Uganda. At first, the two protagonists of the novel live drastically different lives. Esther is a Ugandan teenager abducted by the Lord’s Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony; Jane is an American journalist who has suffered a series of failed relationships. Jane decides to embark on a trip to Africa not only to give voice to children like Esther but also to find herself in the process. In “Thirty Girls,” Minot subtly interweaves the two women’s realities and shows how they profoundly affect each other. Recounted in unflinching, nuanced prose, “Thirty Girls” is a story of incredible pain and resilience.
The book begins as Jane lands in Nairobi, Kenya, and Esther sits in the Kiryandongo Rehabilitation Center for abducted children. The book is set up such that at first, it seems that Jane and Esther will soon meet each other and that the rest of the book will detail their interaction. Minot, however, structures the rest of the book so that while Jane makes her way to Kiryandongo, Esther reflects on her experiences—of abduction, murder, rape, death, and pregnancy. The reader neither learns about Esther’s experiences through the lens of Jane, nor hears about Jane’s past through Esther. Instead, as the characters each have their own reality in the book, the reader lives and feels Esther and Jane’s individual pains separately. Additionally, this structure allows for more character and plot development––for example, Jane meets and immediately falls in love with Harry, a much younger, carefree expat in Nairobi. As their relationship grows, we learn about Jane’s immense sense of isolation and insecurity. The result of this increased character development is that when Esther and Jane finally cross paths at the end, the reader knows both of them and cares about them deeply.
Although the two separate narratives have the potential to be confusing and disconnected, Minot skillfully unites the threads by means of the alienation that both characters experience. Using precise and direct prose, Minot shows how Esther distances herself from the situation to avoid the brutality of her experience. When Esther sees Kony again after he has raped her, she suppresses the memory: “Seeing Kony’s face again made my body split apart from me…. When I looked at him I had the reminder of his wet mouth and other unpleasant things he did to the girl on the bed who was me. I looked away.” Jane struggles to confront her reality as well. When Jane says that trauma victims cannot block their experiences out, her love interest Harry tells Jane, “[You] block things out. I watch you go away when you’re right here.” The characters feel removed from their situation, as if they are observers. At the same time, this self-distancing puts the reader and the character on a similar level, and allows the reader to feel a participant rather than a voyeur.
The characters, however, are ultimately unable to perfectly distance themselves from their pasts, and Minot thus increases the emotional impact of her novel. Just as Jane argues with Harry that people cannot completely suppress traumatic experiences, the fragmentation of the narrative illustrates how memories do come back to haunt both Jane and Esther. When Esther’s baby—a child of her rapist—is born dead, Esther seems to be unaffected at first: “But my feelings, they did not appear to me.” Yet when Esther runs into a fleeing woman with a child, Esther is reminded of her loss: “The pain in my stomach seemed to become something warm and for the first time I thought of my baby as a thing I might have cared about and loved.” The fragmentation elucidates how trauma returns unevenly, like irregular beats, never quite letting the victims go.
In the context of this fragmentation, the interweaving of the two narratives also allows the reader to see how Esther and Jane transform each other when they do meet at the end of the novel. As Jane asks Esther to talk about her experience, Esther thinks, “Perhaps I would be stubborn forever. Or I could change. So maybe this was the time of my chance.” Jane, meanwhile, learns that it is okay to admit to her true feelings as Esther recounts her story: “The last thing she, or anyone else for that matter, needs is to be told how she ought not to feel something, or that what had happened was not as bad as it felt.” The sense of alienation from the book’s earlier portions is gone—this is a moment of catharsis, a turning point in their psychological evolution. This conclusion comes as a relief after the emotional tumult that characterizes the majority of the novel.
Susan Minot’s “Thirty Girls” is a powerful novel that viscerally narrates the journey of two women, both of whom have suffered from displacement, brutality, and isolation. It is psychologically haunting, intense, and overwhelming at times—befitting its gruesome topic. Simultaneously, Minot ensures through the novel’s carefully-executed structure that the reader comes to feel emotionally invested in both characters. Only when each character prevails at the novel’s conclusion is the emotional tension that has driven it forward finally relieved: “All the worry seems to lift from the surface of the world, and what you see there is so dazzling in its simplicity and beauty you think you could die you are so in love with life.”

In Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road,” an unnamed father and his sickly son navigate their way through a post-apocalyptic world, resiliently marching down a blasted highway in search of hope. Grey clouds have permeated the landscape, forcing the sun to retreat “like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world.” Time, too, has resigned, steeping the characters in a setting so utterly disoriented that all the world’s foundations seem to rest precariously upon the emotional bond that links the two.
Love and grief, dependence and the parent-child relationship, morals and their manifestation in a degenerate world: these are the themes that arise in McCarthy’s “The Road.” But as with the protagonists’ expedition down the road itself, it is unclear whether the journey through these themes will yield any answers.
Though the plot features some rich points, such as several encounters with ravening bands of cannibals and thrilling forays into abandoned (and perhaps not!) homes in search of residual supplies, the novel’s magnificence lies in its agonizingly intricate character development.
Much of this development comes in the form of unadorned monologues or dialogues between the father and his son. McCarthy’s conversations are simple and informal, while still managing to remain sophisticated and dramatic.
The minimalistic nature of McCarthy’s prose seems to match the uncomplicated and barren world in which the characters find themselves. Their relationships are confined to one another, their goals limited to reaching the end of the road, and the derelict backdrop provides little material for external distraction. In fact, part of what makes this work so compelling is that McCarthy forces the reader to remain fully engaged in the emotional turmoil plaguing both father and son by providing no alternative subject for consideration.
McCarthy’s poetic genius shines through just as brilliantly in the delicately placed extended narrations that are interspersed throughout the novel. One of the first exhibitions of this sort reads as follows: “The ashes of the late world carried on the bleak and temporal winds to and fro in the void. Carried forth and scattered and carried forth again. Everything uncoupled from its shoring. Unsupported in the ashen air. Sustained by a breath, trembling and brief.” The cadence, the repetition, the piercing ambiguity—endless factors combine to perfect the tragic beauty of this passage.  McCarthy proves his literary prowess over and over again throughout the novel, not only confirming his capacity for seamlessly shifting styles, but also encouraging manifold contemplation of the circumstances.
 
“The Road” is not a book to be missed. Without a doubt, it is heavy, somber, and mildly depressive. But McCarthy’s insights on the origins of significance, grief, and fear, the essential components of real horror, cannot go unheeded. The added bonus of intermittent linguistic masterpieces should tip any skeptics over the edge. For our generation, McCarthy’s work poses a grave challenge: to reassess the trajectory of the American Dream, to ask what lies at the end and what the journey to its acquisition ought to entail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The vitality of Harvard’s theater community is only increasing, with more shows going up this spring than in any prior semester in recent memory. The stress on the theater infrastructure produced by the unprecedented 31 shows slated for runs this semester has raised important questions about the future of student theater at Harvard: do the current processes for theater space allotment serve the current needs of the theater community? And do more productions on more stages necessarily mean better theater? Meanwhile, the difficulty of procuring space has inspired several groups of students to take their shows in new and innovative directions, seeking out unconventional venues and aiming to present the Harvard community with productions that challenge their conception of on-campus theater.
 
GROWTH AND CHANGE
There are two central channels for the allocation of Harvard’s stage space: the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and the Office for the Arts. The HRDC is responsible for allocating space in the Loeb Drama Center, which has two stages: the large Loeb Mainstage, which hosts two shows per semester, and the smaller, more intimate Experimental or Ex, which hosts six to eight shows per semester. The OFA is responsible for determining which shows will receive space in Farkas Hall and Agassiz Theater, as well as allocating grant funding for productions. 
The application process for the spring semester begins in late November with pre-applications, which list director and producer information alongside a synopsis of the show. A full application quickly follows in early December. It includes not only director and producer names but also a full staff list, with positions running the gamut from props mistress to assistant lighting designer. The final step is an interview with the board of the venue applied for, during which board members ask the production staff questions, in order to get a detailed handle on the look and feel of the show. These range from straightforward questions about staff members’ level of experience, to queries directed at directors and designers regarding their creative visions for the show.
“Basically, what the HRDC is looking for is shows that have a really strong vision, shows that we think people want to act in, that would benefit the community, not just the people who are excited about the show and already on staff,” President of the HRDC Alexandra M. Kiley ’14 says. Other factors taken into consideration include the practicability of a show’s design plans, the experience level of its staff, and the completeness of its staff. “One question we always ask,” Kiley says, ‘“Is ‘What is one mistake you made on your last production, and how do you plan on remedying that?’” After a show is approved, the next important step comes at the beginning of the season with Common Casting, when shows hold auditions for actors en masse.
  These processes have served the Harvard theater community well for years. However, this semester has seen an explosion of productions—three times the typical number of shows applied for HRDC space, which, even accounting for the typical ebb and flow in the number of productions per semester, is unprecedented. As a result, the typical processes are being strained in terms of both personnel and space.
 
THE PERSONNEL SCRAMBLE 
According to Allen J. MacLeod ’14, director of this spring’s “The Drowsy Chaperone,” filling up the cast of a production can be a challenge. “It’s becoming more and more competitive not just to get space, but once you have space, to get actors,” he says. But perhaps the greatest demand is for technical staff. “Whenever you feel that it is appropriate, you start emailing people trying to compile a team of producers and [a] stage manager, lighting designers, things of that nature, and it’s just sort of an arbitrary system,” MacLeod says. “There’s no set start date. So what you find is that every year people start asking earlier and earlier, ‘Will you be on my team?’” 
The struggle to find personnel for productions this season has caused some to feel considerable dissatisfaction regarding the production application process. “Especially because not everyone gets space, you find people signing onto multiple projects, and sometimes it works out that they only get to do one or two, but sometimes it’s like, ‘Oh, the projects I signed onto happened to be up, and I have to set-design for four shows’—which has happened,” MacLeod says. “The system is sort of—well, that’s the problem. There is no system. There is an end goal—to have a team ready by X date—but there is no system. People find themselves overcommitted, under-committed, or scrambling to find people.” 
Evan R. Schueckler ’15, stage manager for the recent Dunster House Opera production of “Così fan tutte,” is all too familiar with the demand for technical staff. “I’ve been a stage manager a number of times here,” Schueckler says. “Some semesters I’ve had as many as seven shows ask me to stage manage. The theater community is very stretched for technical staff, and it’s very stressful for people.”
Kiley concurs. “The people who do tech, people like light designers, get about a million e-mails at the beginning of the semester, and it’s a little overwhelming and a little bit stressful,” she says. 
Concerns about increasingly early staff recruitment have prompted the HRDC to plan on revising the application process. “The HRDC is looking to...possibly have Ex shows apply with just a producer and director, as opposed to a full staff, and have that staff recruitment process happen after a show [gets space], so that the decision process will be based more on the tightness of the design and the director’s vision,” Kiley says. “With the shows that got space, designers would have a lot more agency.” 
  Sean K. Hardy ’16, director of the upcoming production “Emilie: La Marquise Du Châtelet Defends Her Life Tonight,” shared his ideas for how the process might be revised. “I feel the way technicians are recruited needs to be something similar to the common casting process…I think it might alleviate some of the stress,” says Hardy. “Right now, it’s a lot for the board, and I appreciate immensely the job they do, and I think that a large vision of the board is to make sure that, as a theater community, with so many separate shows going up each semester, we stay one community.”
 
BRAVE NEW SPACE
Beyond the strain on the human capital of the theater, there is a second stress: the need for the raw physical resource crucial for every production, space. While it is true that there are more shows being put on this semester, a smaller proportion of proposed productions are getting space. This phenomenon is perhaps most noticeable at the Loeb Ex. Typically, six to eight shows apply for slots in the Ex. This semester, 22 applied. Even with the addition of the “zero-slot”—an extra slot that comes right on the heels of casting and requires shows to hold auditions before winter break—a much higher percentage of shows are being rejected. “It [comes down to] space, “ director of this spring’s “Penelope,” Jacob A. Brandt ’14 says. “There are only six or seven slots in the Ex and two on the Mainstage per semester, and you quickly run into problems with how can you do all this great theater with a limited amount of space and time.” 
  While there is no easy remedy for the tightness of actors and staff, one reaction to the tightness of space has been to seek less conventional venues for productions. This semester will see increased use not only of the smaller traditional stages on campus like the Adams Pool Theater and the Cabot House Theater, the latter of which is running a full schedule of five shows for the first time in memory, but also the use of stage spaces that are not designed for theater at all.
One such production is Hardy’s “Emilie.” This production will go up in one of the more daring spaces on campus, the so-called “SciBox”: a large-capacity physics lab on the third floor of the Science Center with movable seating. Knowing how tight space was this season, Hardy and his producer S. Jumai Yusuf ’16 had the SciBox in mind even as they applied for space in the Loeb Ex. “We really wanted to bring the audience into this weird, abstract place with ‘Emilie,’ the importance being that we are trying to bring theater to a larger community on campus, namely the scientific community. When envisioning that, we always envisioned ways we could incorporate the space to make it more inviting for people who don’t necessarily come out to see theater,” says Hardy. “It was my tech director, [Max B. Schaffer ’17], who stated that he didn’t think the Ex would be the right space for the play, and I kind of agreed with him, but we weren’t sure what to do.”  When asked if he regrets not getting a slot in the Ex, his answer was an unequivocal. “No.” 
Hardy says he thinks that the use of nontraditional stages is critical to the mission of the Harvard theater community. “I’m aware that this is a project that could totally fall on its face, and I’m okay with that, because…there is a large debate in the theater community about what it means to have students putting on this art every semester. We know everyone in it, so why are we doing it? So for me, it’s about how you can stretch the confines of theater. And what safer place is there than a student setting, where we’re given all these resources and we’re allowed to fail? We’re trying to test out new questions and try out new boundaries.”
“La Ronde” is a second student production slated to go up this spring that plans to utilize an unconventional space. Directed by Julian A. Leonard ’15 and Daniel W. Erickson ’14, this version of the Austrian play will be sound-based, and will unfold not on a stage, but in a residential building: “Ideally a space with some kind of strong, singular connotation external to the university environment,” Leonard says. 
Like Hardy, Erickson believes the use of nontraditional venues for theater enables productions to impact audiences in a unique way. "Bringing an audience into a residential interior, or the basement of a factory, or the backroom of a toy store gives [an] event a very specific framing apparatus to work with,” Erickson says. 
The use of an unconventional space also allows a show to comment on what it means to experience theater in a given space. "Part of the appeal of a black box theater, the white cube of a gallery space, or the line of a proscenium is that in theory, these supposed blank slates allow for the world of a piece to be created from scratch,” Leonard says. “But no piece exists in isolation from its cultural contexts.”
 
CHANGES TO COME? 
Of course, there is a second obvious response to the felt need for theater space: building or repurposing structures to meet that need. 
“There just seem to be so many people coming into Harvard now that are interested in theater.... It makes sense that more and more people are applying to direct and produce plays,” says Brandt. “And I think that it’s sort of a double-edged sword because…[though] there isn’t great infrastructure for the people who want to do these plays...it’s telling the University that there’s something that needs to be done.” 
Hardy agrees that while there is much benefit to using the smaller spaces on campus, infrastructure should be increased to accommodate larger shows. “Things need to change. There needs to be more on campus,” he says. “A limitation of doing shows in space like the black box at the Ex or [in] the Pool is that the seating capacity is smaller.... When you have a smaller seating capacity, and all the theater people want to go to see the shows that their friends are in, you don’t get to bring it to more people. That’s such a shame, because people put their hearts and souls into it.”
Hardy also says he thinks that there should be a change in emphasis for the technical requirement, which requires HRDC members to assist with technical work on a show every semester. In his opinion, it should be oriented towards giving real training, in order to help lighten the burden placed on the experience technical staff members. “I think tech req should be more of a mentoring program, so that if you were to tech req light design for one or two shows, you’re at the light board with the light designer, looking at how they’re plugging cues in, you’re working with them that week, so that it’s less of a ‘I’m not a part of this show, I’m just doing this as a requirement, I’ll screw some things, and that’s that’ [kind of] thing.”
 
 
THE SHOWS MUST GO ON 
  The recent flood of passion into the performing arts is exciting, and rather than abating, seems to be increasing among new Harvardians. “It seems like there is a move [toward] a lot of younger directors applying for space,” Kiley says. This statement is borne out by the large number of sophomore-directed shows, as well as three freshman-directed shows (not including the annual freshman musical), going up this semester. 
 It remains to be seen what specific measures the theater community will take to adjust to its increased size and activity. But one thing that appears certain is that the upsurge in theatrical activity witnessed this semester will not flag anytime soon. According to Kiley, an imminent academic change is poised to encourage continuing growth in the theater community. “I think [the] trend toward more theater on campus [may also be occurring] because the dramatic arts department is introducing a concentration sometime in the next few years,” Kiley says. “I’m not exactly sure how that will affect the theater scene at all, but it seems that there are more classes being offered, just more excitement on campus about theater in general.”
While the challenges posed by it are numerous, the growth of theater at Harvard is a phenomenon poised to push the bounds of art-making at the college. Student ingenuity and inventiveness has marked this growing period so far and may well continue into the future. The vigorous increase in interest during this transitional period is bound to result in dramatic changes. But the shows will go on—more of them than ever before.

The first 10 seconds of Miguel’s “Simplethings” seem more Nirvana than Prince, though Miguel cites the latter as one of his most significant musical influences. The track, released on the second-season soundtrack of the HBO series “Girls,” is a startling amalgam of grunge and R&B, melding the low buzz of distorted guitar with slick production that showcases Miguel’s vocal range and dexterity. As a show, “Girls” is ultimately a celebration of the ordinary, and “Simplethings” provides an oddly appropriate musical background. “I don’t need a model / I don’t need a debutante,” Miguel croons. “A free spirit / with a wild heart... someone real / someone true”—and the ladies of “Girls” are nothing if not heartbreakingly, earnestly true and relatable in the way they live from day to mundane day.
 
The single bodes well for Miguel’s as-of-yet untitled third studio album, which the artist claims will top even 2012’s critically acclaimed “Kaleidoscope Dream.” Though in the past he has frequently been compared to artists like the Grammy-winning Frank Ocean and indie R&B darling The Weeknd, with “Simplethings” Miguel crafts a song that distinguishes itself with seamless integration of two highly disparate genres, proving himself more than capable of holding his own and giving listeners a taste of what is yet to come.

After disbanding in 2001, New York City-based Shibuya-kei group Cibo Matto reunited 10 years later in preparation for a new studio album, the band’s first in almost 15 years. On Feb. 14, “Hotel Valentine” will finally hit shelves in the United States. Before their performance at the Sinclair on Feb. 8, Cibo Matto founders Miho Hatori and Yuka C. Honda sat down with The Crimson to talk about their band, their influences, and their new album.
 
THC: What made you decide to reunite?
 
Miho Hatori: It was a very organic process—it’s not one reason. I guess it was time.
 
THC: How have things been different or the same since reuniting?
 
Yuka C. Honda: I think the core [of the music] is still the same, but the times are different, so the way we work is a lot different, the technology is different… things like that are different.
 
THC: Will your latest album see any new musical influences?
 
YCH: Yes, a lot. There have been so many great artists since our last album. Like in the early 2000s there were the Neptunes, who were really great. Is Timbaland ’90s? Timbaland is ’90s, right?
 
MH: Kind of, yeah.
 
YCH: I really love this band called Death Grips—I really, really like them a lot, and they’re pretty new. I like D’Angelo.
 
THC: Cibo Matto is in some ways from Japan and in other ways from New York City. What influences has this had on your music?
 
YCH: The fact that we’re Japanese-influenced music? I’m sure there are a lot [of influences], but it’s very hard for us to tell because we are Japanese-Americans. But I think Miho and I definitely grew up there, so there’s some ways that we think that are different. And also I think the fact that we live in a foreign country, we have this alien status that probably influences our mind and philosophy. But we are not really that conscious of it—we’re just being ourselves.
 
THC: Do you think the alien status has shown up more over time through your music, or is that something that you started out with and have had to overcome?
 
MH: I think both. I think there are things that are difficult that we have to overcome, but there are things that we’re proud of. I think if I make music with somebody else....it will be different. It’s more about Yuka and me and our chemistry. I’ve never thought of it as because Yuka is Japanese. I think of Yuka as “Yuka.”
 
YCH: I think of Miho as a blonde woman.
 
THC: You have an album coming out this week. What is “Hotel Valentine” about?
 
YCH: “Hotel Valentine” is a concept. There’s a concept that they’re in this hotel and there’s a ghost, and there’s a traveler who’s in love with her and only he can see her because of love. There are all these events that happen, and there are delinquent housekeepers... It’s for fun; we created this environment.
 
THC: So it’s some sort of story.
 
MH: Yeah. It’s like we made an invisible movie with the music.
 
THC: How is this album different from your previous albums?
 
YCH: Every album is different, kind of like every year is different....it’s not exactly a diary, but it’s a reflection of who we are at the time. I think every album tends to become different because we are really curious people and we like to grow, so every year we have all these new things with us.

Idiosyncratic indie pop is a dangerous game, where credibility is measured in equal parts inaccessibility and obscurity. Artists are expected to succeed in spite of themselves, with recognition and remuneration coming as unexpected artifacts of a loftier pursuit. A melody too catchy or a beat too regular smacks of pandering, and often indie artists overcompensate by steeping their work in esoteric musical devices, burying expression beneath clumsy posturing.
 
Annie Clark, better known by her stage name St. Vincent, has always artfully tightrope-walked across the red string tangled throughout the indie genre, etching a purposefully unique sonic silhouette while never allowing her quirks to overshadow her music. St. Vincent’s latest single,  “Prince Johnny,” off of her upcoming self-titled album, stands as another example of this careful exercise in musical personality. While never compromising her music’s immediate and earnest appeal, Clark deftly weaves elements of funk and jazz into a background of drum machine and keyboard. The instrumentation remains unusual enough to unbalance any complacent listeners, but Clark’s relaxed vocals and signature guitar work serve to anchor the song firmly as a St. Vincent production. In the outro, she plucks a surprisingly crunchy guitar riff to accompany her affective crooning, creating her characteristic blend of baroque vocals and funk instrumentals.
 
St. Vincent comes with an impressive pedigree, having played with both The Polyphonic Spree and Sufjan Stevens, but her solo work stands out in its self-assuredness. Clark doesn’t sound like she has anyone to impress and never tries harder than she has to—“Prince Johnny” feels more like a conversation than a lecture.
 
“St. Vincent” is out on Feb. 25 via Loma Vista/Republic in the United States.

What happens when the lines between art and social activism blur? That’s exactly the question that “Living as Form (The Nomadic Version),” a new exhibit at the Carpenter Center which opened this past Thursday and will run until April 6, attempts to address. A reinvisioning of a 2011 New York exhibition, “Living as Form” is a traveling and continually growing collection of unconventional and eclectic pieces focusing on observing artistic aesthetics in everyday social activism.
Pieces in the exhibit range from a series of long basketball nets cut and re-knitted by children to an interactive installation in which attendees are presented with a collection of audio clips reflecting on the “War on the Poor.” Artist Caitlin Berrigan’s “Lessons in Capitalism” is especially attention-grabbing. The piece takes the form of a Harvard Business School affiliate offering free financial advice to attendees, which is sent through pneumatic tubes to unseen financial advisors who turn out to be between the ages of five and 10. Berrigan says the interactive aspect of the piece fits with the mission of the exhibit. “[The concept of ‘Living as Form’] is an interesting one. It’s about participatory and socially engaged work, and that’s often hard to capture. It’s nice that this one can be live and have a participatory component.”
“Living as Form” also boasts several scheduled live performances throughout its duration. During the exhibit’s opening reception, performance artist Tomashi Jackson created an original artwork. Perched on a small industrial scaffolding, Jackson used red oil sticks to draw on the Carpenter Center’s window, explaining the act as a way of reflecting on the largely unseen nature of labor. “I am drawing portraits of two people who work at the Carpenter Center…onto the glass of this historic piece of architecture,” Jackson said. “I’m interested in labor that is largely invisible and very necessary. A lot of my work is centered on…imagining and visualizing private labor.”
In addition to live performances, “Living as Form” contains many pieces that take the form of accounts of socially conscious artistic endeavors throughout the country. Projects range from adapting abandoned homes into campuses for artists and single mothers to invigorating rarely visited towns by converting local train stations into free hotels. Exhibit curator Nato Thompson acknowledged the difficulties involved with trying to capture such work. “Projects in ‘Living as Form (The Nomadic Version)’ resist display in an archive like this. Admittedly, each video, poster, and image remains a pale shadow of the original action. Nevertheless, the sheer scale, geographic range, and interdisciplinary nature of these works illustrate how these kinds of projects are participating in the social and political landscape,” he said.
“Living as Form” combines the artistic and the everyday in unique and compelling ways. By viewing social activism through the lens of the gallery, the collection hopes to challenge viewers to reflect on the roles of and subtle interactions between social engagement and art in their lives.

Already among the smallest concentrations available to undergraduates, Visual and Environmental Studies has seen a steady decline in enrolled concentrators over recent years. However, lack of interest may not be the reason behind this decline; in many cases, students who might otherwise have explored the concentration are discouraged by the difficulty of enrollment. Largely due to the department’s preference for intimate seminars, many VES classes have limited enrollments and are notoriously hard to get into as a freshman or non-concentrator.
The competitive process of being admitted into VES classes often presents an obstacle for prospective concentrators, who are frequently unable to take classes in the department until their sophomore year. “It was frustrating primarily because I’m not 100 percent sure if I’m going to concentrate in VES, but I’m very interested in it,” says Kennedy F. Edmonds ’17, who was waitlisted and eventually rejected from an introductory VES class. “The fact that it’s so difficult to take classes in that department makes it difficult for me to figure out whether or not…that is the concentration I want to pursue.” While Edmonds was advised by an administrator in the VES department that taking his first VES class in his sophomore year would not interfere with his ability to concentrate, he still feels as if he would be declaring with “blind optimism.”
For graduate students in the Film and Visual Studies program, the VES Department’s meager course offerings translate to a shortage of teaching jobs and resources. “[The VES Department] has limited teaching availability and tends to be relieved when people like me find teaching in other departments,” says Katie B. Kohn, a Ph.D student who is currently working as a teaching fellow for the Folklore and Mythology class, “History of Witchcraft and Charm Magic.” However, Alfred Guzzetti, a professor in the VES Department, notes that many graduate students in the Film and Visual Studies program lack the experience needed to teach studio classes. “Adding more sections is very problematic because there’s no graduate program in the making of art…. [Film and Visual Studies] is not a making degree, [it’s] a scholarly degree.”
According to Kohn, the VES Department also tends to be very possessive over its resources and hesitant to share them externally. When Kohn asked an administrator for permission to use an unclaimed VES classroom, she was told the classrooms had to remain available should the department need them. Furthermore, Kohn believes that the VES Department is not taking advantage of opportunities for expansion. “It seems that they actively want to keep themselves small, private, elite in a way. Professors encourage that because they really want to have a certain type of student, the way that they screen so heavily. The graduate students in our program on the whole don’t understand that mentality and don’t understand how the administration doesn’t see it as hurtful to both undergraduates and graduates,” Kohn says. As a solution to limited-enrollment classes, she believes an introductory, lecture-style class should be offered to accommodate more students. “There needs to be an intermediary zone,” she says. “Like film history classes…anybody [who] has a computer can start to do something with no cost to the university—fairly short projects that are time-intensive but not unmanageable.”
According to Guzzetti, however, such lecture-style classes are detrimental to both professors and students. “They have existed, but it’s not proved possible to do them on a large scale,” he says. Even in small studio classes, the effects of adding an extra student are noticeable to Guzzetti. “At times when I’ve thought, ‘I really should take this 11th or 12th person,’ and I’ve done that, I’ve regretted it afterwards because everybody gets short shrift,” he explains. Current VES concentrator Thomas J. Barber ’15 shares the sentiment. “The big problem is that for a creative class, you need to keep it small. It’s not like math where you just teach a formula to 800 kids at the same time and that’s fine. You kind of need that intimate relationship with the professor,” he says.
However, Kohn and Guzzetti both agree that one of the largest issues is that it is difficult to predict which classes will attract heavy demand. The statistics that arrive through the College’s pre-term planning system usually tend to vary greatly from the actual enrollment—and without accurate predictions, Guzzetti says, there is very little the VES Department can do in immediate response.

Sun Kil Moon, now the moniker for folk artist Mark Kozelek, continues to cultivate his gloomy affect with its new album “Benji,” which is largely dominated by macabre imagery. This is not to say that the work is completely devoid of happiness; in a few places, Kozelek does celebrate some of his loving relationships. These moments are limited, however, as most of the tracks tackle painful deaths and the tragedy that surrounds them. The album owes much of its success to the honest and grief-ridden way in which these songs are presented. But because of the generally minimalistic approach to instrumentation, a few of the less heart-rending tracks tend to come off a bit flat, with the exceptions of the sexually explicit “Dogs” and the immaculately crafted homage to indie star Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service), “Ben’s My Friend.”
 
Though it is not the first track on the album to introduce death, “Truck Driver” sets the tone for the thematic nature of “Benji.” The foundation of the track is a hypnotically repetitive guitar phrase, over which Kozelek delivers an account of his uncle’s death and his family’s grief in a despondent croon, sometimes trailing off into a soft growl. His solemn whisper is most pronounced in the line “Third degree burns, a charred-up shovel in his hand / My uncle died a respected man,” as Kozelek’s own grief overwhelms him to the point of near-silence.
 
Kozelek’s penchant for the morbid further manifests itself in the highly effective early emotional climax “Pray for Newtown.” Lyrically, the song aims to shift focus from the inevitable media frenzy surrounding mass murders to the pain that has been endured by those connected to the victims. It ends with the suggestion, “When you’re gonna get married, and you’re out shopping around, / take a moment to think about the families that lost so much in Newtown.” The raw emotion that is evident in the distressed vocals, the haunting guitar riff, and the heartbreaking subject matter make “Pray for Newtown” incredibly poignant.
Despite the ubiquity of its morbid themes, “Benji” does present a couple of extremely risky yet successful moments that do not rely on grief and mourning. The first of these is “Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes.” Though the song is about the death of a serial killer, it uses dissonant melodies and babbling lyrics to create a spine-chilling piece that sounds more eerie than sad. Its minor production details—such as spoken lyrics underneath the sung ones—along with its cryptic nature make it strangely captivating. The other risk taken was the final track “Ben’s My Friend,” which diverges from the genre of folk rock that aptly describes the rest of the album. Kozelek introduces saxophone and backup singers to assist him with the singing of “ba ba ba” while playing his guitar in an uncharacteristically bright and upbeat manner during the instrumental interludes. Though his voice maintains its rough edge, the effect is mitigated by the lyrical content. Though at first glance, the elements of “Ben’s My Friend” seem disparate, the song manages to successfully incorporate jazz-inspired motifs into its folk skeleton.
 
Unfortunately for “Benji,” this level of interest is not found in the other light-hearted songs. The simple recipe of strummed guitar and pedestrian, anecdotal lyrics, especially when juxtaposed with some of the emotional heavy hitters on the album, becomes dull and unexciting. Luckily, these forgettable tracks, which are neither evocative nor captivating, compose only a small portion of the album and do not significantly hinder the appreciation of Kozelek’s artistry.
The undeniable power of the macabre events recounted in “Benji,” along with the moments that push the boundaries of folk music, helps distinguish Kozelek’s newest work from both previous Sun Kil Moon albums and the music of many other contemporary artists in the genre. Though the songs on “Benji” were, by and large, well-written and well-executed, the true appeal of the album is its haunting emotional weight.

Men in trailing skirts, arm slapping, flexed feet—none of these would you traditionally associate with ballet, but all are prominently featured in Boston Ballet’s upcoming performance of “Close to Chuck,” starting Feb. 20 and running through March 2.
A selection of dancers and choreographers from Boston Ballet brought their skills to a Harvard audience on Feb. 9, performing excerpts of “Close to Chuck,” a program composed of pieces by choreographers Jorma Elo and Jiři Kylián and the world premiere of José Martinez’s new ballet “Resonance.”
Held in the Dance Center at Harvard, the Boston Ballet talk offered dancers, students, and members of the Cambridge community not only the chance to see movements of these pieces in a close, intimate setting, but also the opportunity to hear the dancers and choreographers—including José Martinez himself, through a video clip—talk about the process and answer questions from the audience about these more contemporary ballet pieces.
Javier F. Aranzales ’16, one of three Boston Ballet college ambassadors at Harvard and a member of the Harvard Ballet company, was ecstatic about having the Boston Ballet come to Harvard to talk.
“It’s really great to have them in our community, and to have them come out here and build a bridge to these communities,” Aranzales said, explaining that while Boston Ballet is relatively near Harvard, students don’t usually go out to see the performances, so this free performance was helpful for engaging the Harvard community.
The excerpt performed from Jorma Elo’s “C. to C.,” originally commissioned by the American Ballet Theater but reworked by Elo for Boston Ballet, drew the audience in from its slightest movements to its intricate pair work. The work is set to music composed by Philip Glass for artist Chuck Close, and in this piece, named for the painter, both men and women wear long, black, trailing skirts that unfold to reveal a self-portrait by Close.
In the work’s first movement, three pairs of male and female dancers stand in convoluted positions in center stage, moving so slowly and with so much care that each choreographed hand roll or eye movement captures the audience’s attention. “The first movement is very slow, and you can actually see all the details of the movement, which for me is really great because sometimes [Elo] has us move so fast that you miss a lot of it or you can’t process it as quickly as you see it,” principal Boston Ballet dancer Kathleen Breen Combes said in the post-performance talk.
“Resonance” by José Martinez, the last excerpt performed, was only completed very recently, as artistic director Mikko Nissinen explained in a video clip played during the event. The Boston Ballet is the first North American ballet company ever to commission a piece from Martinez, who began working with the dancers last fall. “We’d learn 12 or 13 pieces, and then audition with them for [Martinez], and we’ll only end up performing in three,” Boston Ballet dancer Dusty Button explained.
The dancing in “Resonance” exhibits a more classical style, but it is not without its own hint of the contemporary. In the first excerpt, a solo female dancer is passed among five male dancers, barely touching the floor as she flies around the stage on the arms of her partners. One by one, the male dancers walk offstage, leaving the female dancer with a single partner. A second couple dances in and out of the wings, shadowing the work of the main pair of dancers. This transitions into the second excerpt, a pas de deux between the second couple.
As a dancer, Aranzales was ecstatic about the performance. “You can see professional dancers—who are amazing and beautiful—come here and share your passion with you; it’s very rejuvenating to see that,” he said.
He also noted how important these kinds of performances are for the community. “It really brings the arts to Harvard. And having a post-performance talk with the dancers really makes the arts more accessible and shows the deep intellectual understanding behind what can seem like a superficial, moving-your-body discipline.”

French director Alain Guiraudie recently won best director in the Un Certain Regard category at the Cannes Film Festival for his work “Stranger By the Lake,” a thriller centered on an affair between two gay men at a clothing-optional beach. Guiraudie, who for the last 15 years has been writing and directing provocative films concerning French sexual mores and expectations, has been on a tour of the U.S. promoting his newest work, which also received an ecstatic response at Sundance and Lincoln Center. Although initially “afraid” of the Harvard Film Archive’s offer to host a retrospective and master class series, Guiraudie eventually agreed to attend, and the series ran from Jan. 31 to Feb. 8. Crimson Arts sat down with the auteur to discuss his career and artistic vision.
This interview was facilitated by translation from David W. Pendleton, programmer at the HFA.
THC: What directors and artists have been most influential in your development?
 
AG: “The Adventures of Tintin,” and the larger world of Hergé was one of the first things I spent a lot of time with; Luis Buñuel, Jean Renoir, American Westerns by John Ford, “Tarzan.” Almodóvar and Nanni Moretti are contemporary influences. Foundational writers like Shakespeare and Sophocles are also very important to me.
 
THC: More recently, your films have incorporated more elements of realism. Do you see this continuing?
 
AG: I have gone towards a more realistic style, but it has been to transform the real. What I really like is the idea of a naturalism that changes the world and makes people see things differently. Cinema is taking elements from the real world and giving them a dimension of dream and fantasy, even within the confines of realism.
 
THC: Is your raw exploration of eroticism purely artistic or also political?
 
AG: The way I approach sexuality is political because I put sex at the center of relationships…. Sex is at the same emotional level as passion and love in my work. The idea is to remove explicit sex from being inherently pornographic, which poses many aesthetic questions: how do you frame and film the sex act? But, yes, it is ultimately a political project.
 
THC: “Stranger By the Lake” focuses entirely on the intrigue of the beach. Was the shoot extremely short as a result of how contained the work is, or was your filming more deliberate?
 
AG: The shooting wasn’t very long…. It was six weeks of shooting, so I didn’t have all of the time I wanted. Initially, I was going to shoot the film in sequence, but it was easier to film all of the scenes of the nudists together, all of the scenes in the water at once. So that’s what we did.
 
THC: You often write and direct your films. Do you visualize your films while writing their screenplays?
 
AG: Yes, when I write it’s usually extremely visual. I modeled the environment of  “Stranger By the Lake” on a location I knew, but we ultimately filmed somewhere else. Additionally, the actors who played the parts did not look at all like those I had initially visualized. Once the shoot comes around everything usually changes...
 
THC: Do you have a close relationship with your actors, or are you more strict and distant?
 
AG: I work very closely with my actors. When shooting I don’t look through the viewfinder or the monitor; I’m watching the actors. With those shots where the framing and movement is very exact, I talk extensively to the camera operator and still watch the actors.
 
THC: There’s a shot that re-occurs 10 times throughout the film of a parking lot. What was its genesis?
 
AG: It didn’t emerge until after the writing process…. the concept was to film all the times where the main character arrives. I’d shoot for a very long time before the car drove in. There was a hill that allowed for a repeated high-angle shot without a crane. Now I wonder if it wouldn’t have been better to change the positioning of the camera…
 
THC: Why do you think that “Stranger By the Lake” has transcended French borders and been so popular in America?
 
AG: Only 35,000 people in France saw my last film, “The King of Escape,” so “Stranger By the Lake” was a big change there too. Some people have been saying it’s my best work…. I think its microcosmic nature makes it applicable.
 
THC: Successful foreign films are often remade in America. Would you be okay with an American “Stranger By the Lake”?
 AG: So far nobody’s asked…. I’m not sure how I would react. It would be very flattering, but also worrisome. Would they ruin it? Ideally, they would do a remake in 10 years. I wouldn’t want to be too involved. Michael Haneke did [a remake] with the American [version of his Austrian film] “Funny Games.” I don’t want to rework a film I already think I did well…besides the parking lot shot, that is!

If you have ever put Lego bricks together and felt a spark of ingenuity—ever—Phil Lord and Christopher Miller know the feeling. The writer-directors’ “The Lego Movie” succeeds in its devotion to the tiny plastic source material, building touching themes as well as action comedy from the multicolored bricks. Though family-appropriate, it’s a film for Lego devotees of all ages, with clever humor and a dazzling visual language that older audiences can appreciate. It’s great fun and as intricately constructed as those police stations, spaceships, and mummy tombs of so many childhood memories.
 

 Its hero’s first sequence is a stunner: Emmet (Chris Pratt) wakes and consults “Instructions” to start his day as a construction worker in Bricksburg—a cheery metropolis under the constant surveillance of President Business (Will Ferrell). The bustling brick streets are breathtaking from every angle, resembling the wild worlds of Miller and Lord’s “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” franchise, and the yellow-headed citizens of Bricksburg singing Tegan and Sara & The Lonely Island’s theme “Everything is AWESOME!!!” sets the film’s tone. The happy homogeneity of the city is an example of the film’s best innovation—using Lego components like pieces and instructions to address themes of conformity and creativity.
 
The film takes Emmet and co. from Bricksburg to the Wild West and the high seas, from the iridescent paradise of Cloud Cuckoo Land to the robotic skyscraper of President Business, in a quest to use the “Piece of Resistance” to destroy Business’s superweapon. The Legoscapes are immense; the CGI brick renderings of explosions, water, and smoke are predictably beautiful. Miller and Lord’s most interesting effect, though, is a jerkiness of the frame and of background motion—the passage of time in the film seems to progress in chunky increments, befitting a film about Lego bricks.
 
Nor do the directors overlook the bricks’ opportunities for action and for comedy. The former sequences are excitingly done—construction cranes reassembled into an “Aliens” loader-style robot for a city-wrecking fight scene, a Western saloon rebuilt into a hang glider—but not overdone to the point where every obstacle seems navigable by brick-craft. The humor draws from the diversity of Lego’s product lines, as in a scene with the Council of Master Builders—where Renaissance artist Michelangelo sits next to his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle counterpart, Dumbledore bickers with Gandalf, and a frustrated Abe Lincoln bellows, “A house divided against itself would be better than this!” before rocketing off in a flying chair. 
 
The film steers largely clear of the repetition jokes or bathroom humor of its genre, and it incorporates Lego’s franchise characters for smart pop-culture humor. The voice actors’ casting plays in: the entrance of the Millennium Falcon yields “Star Wars” allusions sweetened by Anthony Daniels voicing C-3P0, as he did in the saga. Perhaps cleverest, the directors riff off their own “21 Jump Street” with an awkward friendship between Superman and Green Lantern, voiced by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.
 
It’s the intent, though, that is what’s special about “The Lego Movie.” It includes suggestions of a world outside the Lego universe—this world—in moves more reminiscent of “Monsters University” (or “Twilight Zone”) than “Toy Story.” There’s a Band-Aid here, a backdrop that looks like construction paper there. These are funny, but they’re also statements of purpose.
 
They’re reminders that “The Lego Movie” isn’t just a movie with Lego, but a movie about Lego. The film considers what the interlocking toy represents to its viewers more actively and with more complexity than “Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs” does with food, than “Cars” does with cars. It builds themes of imagination and individuality up from the limitless possibilities of the bricks. This ethos powers its most inventive scenes, like a particularly stunning visualization of Emmet’s mind and a brilliant ending.
 
The problem with linking the film’s themes so closely to the experience of building with Lego is that for moviegoers without enthusiasm (or nostalgia) for the toy, those themes may feel empty or extraneous. That said, these people will enjoy “The Lego Movie” anyway—it’s a smart, fun, beautiful film. Its brick-based action and humor are sheer entertainment, its thematic material a loving tribute to the building toy. It takes in everything that’s great about Lego, and that makes for one of the best animated films in years.

After a remarkably interesting campaign run last semester, the UC leadership has begun to deliver on its promises to do more than campaign for tomato basil ravioli soup. There have been a number of internal changes intended to hold UC representatives more accountable as well as incremental improvements, such as bag lunch-ordering changes. Recently, the UC has publicized its efforts to request $250,000 in funding and is planning to meet with University President Drew G. Faust to discuss the funding this month. Student groups need more funds, but $250,000 is a substantial rise from the current allocation. The UC should provide concrete plans for how the additional money would be distributed.
Starting in the fall, the UC raised concerns over the inadequate funds that were available for allocation to clubs on campus. Budget constraints have led to decreased funding for club sports and UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 claims that peer colleges’ student governments have budgets that dwarf Harvard’s. The UC has $489,000 to spend this academic year. By comparison, Georgetown’s equivalent has $970,000 to spend. The sizable disparity supports the request for additional funding. While these claims are legitimate, the UC should be clearer about how the money will be used. Will the funds be directed towards specific programs before others? Will all the funds be sent to student groups or does the UC have other priorities in mind as well? 
The UC has begun the process of gauging student opinion to determine what should be improved or enhanced. As a result of the recent Ghost Protocol Act, UC representatives have distributed surveys at dining halls and requested students to rank their priorities based on listed improvements, such as better dining hall food. While this effort to increase student body participation is commendable, it is unclear if the allocation of funds will be determined as direct result of these surveys. 
Equally important, it is necessary to inform the student body of the current proposed sources for additional funding. Last semester, the UC pushed the administration to increase the $75 term-bill fee paid by all Harvard students. If the money is not going to come from a fee increase, then it has to come from somewhere else. 
The only other option seems to be a reallocation of funds from another source. If this option is pursued, the student body should know what that source is. If revenues are flat and budgets are balanced, a rise in spending in one area means a cut in another. The budget request is promising, but a lot remains uncertain ahead of the UC leadership’s meeting with President Faust.

This past winter break, I traveled to Israel with the Harvard Hillel birthright trip. In addition to touring the country, we participated in a number of conversations about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a result, I returned home both more informed and less sure about my opinions.
This came as a bit of a surprise; after engaging in informative first-hand discussions, I had expected to come back with a whole host of new opinions. Yet given the enormous complexity of one of the globe’s most multifaceted conflicts, it makes perfect sense to say that I lack a hard-line and conclusive opinion after only ten days.
It can be tough to acknowledge: At Harvard, in particular, there can be enormous pressure to know everything and to be confident in your beliefs. Debate is by its nature competitive, so there is value to proving someone else wrong and not backing down. And political engagement is by its nature partisan, so there is an incentive to have a strong opinion as a way of seeming informed and engaged.
Yet indecision is not apathy. There is an oft-overlooked importance to being able to say, “I don’t know.” 
While I believe I logically and independently chose my own political beliefs, I am uneasy about the fact that they are so highly correlated with the beliefs of the people I grew up near in Bethesda, Maryland. As much as I would like to think otherwise, my background and perspective appear to have influenced my outlook. While this is not in and of itself a reason for me to reject my political opinions, it certainly seems like a reason to be comparatively less confident that they are right.
Differences in perspective shape our opinions because they determine the knowledge that we have access to. The lifestyle choices of those living in poverty might not make sense to others who don’t face the same problems. Men don’t experience the same feeling of fear that women do when walking alone at night —this might cause them to underestimate the importance of violence and safety issues affecting women. A person living in a war-torn region is likely to understand the impact of war in a way others could not.
Of course, it’s possible to exaggerate one’s own personal concerns as well; my point is not that personal experience makes one automatically correct on broader policy issues. Rather, it’s not easy to tell who is right: Generational, racial, regional, and socioeconomic differences all play a role in shaping the opinions that people have. People with different information and experiences can use equally valid processes of logical reasoning and arrive at starkly different conclusions.
If getting more information means getting more perspectives, then an increase in information could just as easily lead to an increase in indecision. There’s no reason to say that being informed necessitates having an opinion—it is important to recognize that two opposing opinions might both be valid. 
Admitting you’re not sure opens a lot of doors—it means that discourse isn’t stifled or protest valued above conversation. This is particularly important in a college environment, which is a place where many people form their worldviews. When students at Brown heckled former New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly off the stage last semester, they valued their own opinions above the idea of open discourse. By attaching so much confidence to the fact that their opinions about stop-and-frisk were accurate, they improperly oversimplified a complicated topic and prevented valuable dialogue that could have better informed people about the subject. 
Arguably, as much as it pains me to admit as an avid feminist interested in science, even outrage over Larry Summers’ comment about women in STEM was unjustified. As psychology professor Steven Pinker aptly pointed out, Summers’ statement actually does have potential logical justification— there is evidence suggesting differences, be they the result of genetics or socialization, between men and women’s natural preferences for certain fields. Anyone who disagrees with this argument (myself admittedly included) should argue against it instead of simply ending discourse on the topic and calling for Summers’ resignation.
The correct course of action should be to engage opposing viewpoints, not to silence them. There’s a strong argument to be made that hateful and blatantly offensive speech should not be given a microphone. But any opinion that has its basis in logical argumentation and not hatred is potentially valid.
That's why your teachers in high school told you it was more important to show your work than to get the right answer. It’s important to know the true answers, but it is more important to learn the process by which those answers can be reached. If we are left with just a set of formulas—a political dogma—and no ability to logically reason and figure out answers beyond those we are given, then political polarization and false confidence follow.
Essentially, we need to be more willing to say that we aren’t sure about things. But really, who knows? That’s just my opinion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
One afternoon two Aprils ago I found myself with an unexpected hour of freedom. Section had been cancelled. The light had a golden hue; the Square was warm and awash in color. The sun, piercing through the red oaks in the Yard, made it seem like the Wigglesworth bricks were glowing crimson. 
Brochure Harvard.
I stepped into the Harvard Book Store, overcome by a spasm of disbelief. It all fit together: rows of books for unfettered browsing; students trekking up the slight incline of Plympton Street and skirting along Massachusetts Avenue, walking with purpose towards the Yard, to weave in and out of ancient paths and buildings weighted with history. All of the clichés suddenly felt real. The Seamus Heaney poem emblazoned onto my admissions packet had come to life.
Everything else was so far away. There were no family members at home to worry about, or commitments to honor, or big problems to consider. It was a welcome moment of self-induced ignorance. Until, standing in the philosophy aisle, I noticed an older man limping towards his wife. His khaki pants had turned brown. Dark streaks ran down his legs. He had soiled himself, completely and unmistakably. “We need to get you home,” his wife said, her hand cupped around his upper arm.
I left the store immediately. I was embarrassed by the fatuousness of my neatly constructed, idealized Harvard moment. I had, however briefly, created a world where unpleasant things didn’t happen. I called my mother as I escaped toward the Quad. I had to tell someone, even though it felt voyeuristic, sensational. It felt childish: Gee mom, bad things happen, don’t they? “That’s old age,” she said, matter-of-factly. “That’s real life.”
We often separate “Harvard” and “real life.” It makes sense, perhaps, to divorce the two. Real life is a functionally useful term for a place with mortgages and paychecks and uncomfortable family gatherings, a place without three prepared meals a day, without friends who wax philosophical at a dorm party at 2 a.m. But this separation also implicitly allows us to neglect the uneven texture of human experience. If real life exists elsewhere, then its full weight must remain outside Harvard’s gates. The proverbial “Harvard bubble” doesn’t just abstract us from the painful realities of what stands outside of it. It also homogenizes individual experience.
This is a place of privilege; by any practicable measure, our quality of life here is extraordinarily high. We’re protected – we can neatly seal ourselves off and immerse ourselves in the otherworldly pursuits of scholarship and success. Yet this separation makes the moments when we fall short harder to confront: it feels like a betrayal of the brochure ideal. Amidst failure, the Yard on a pleasant afternoon becomes just as oppressive as it was glorious.
When we do talk about not feeling like our best selves, we rely on narrow binaries. We’re fine, or not fine. We’re stressed, or not stressed. The content of our lives is explained away by generic adjectives we never bother to unpack.
Telling each other that Harvard is hard, that we’re all stressed and pushed to meet some unimaginably high standard, trivializes. It creates a reduced, artificially common experience. It becomes just as impersonal as the feeling that Harvard is perfect and we’re not.
But if we’re looking to lessen the gulf between what feels insulating and what feels realistic, to step out of the bubble, I think we often take the wrong approach.
Life here is a series of unhistoric moments punctuated with a sense of awe. We write off the seemingly insignificant, but it carries enormous richness. It’s noticing, somehow for the first time, that when a friend is happy her words suddenly sound as if they are made of laughter, that she swallows giggles in between breaths. It’s realizing that when your roommate has made progress on his thesis he rhythmically flicks his hands back and forth as he explains, his eyes expanding and contracting as he speaks, his excitement at something that you are now a part of.
It’s tempting to tell the story of our time at Harvard through a series of seminal events. Housing Day, that one really fun formal, that semester of great grades. But the times we feel closest to one another often look meaningless on the surface. We don’t need to look far to find real life, and in fact it has little to do with Harvard at all.  It’s a trip to CVS, where choosing detergent leads to an anecdote about childhood. It’s a shortcut through the Science Center, to avoid the cold, where we can finally tell someone what it was like to fail that exam in Hall C.
Real life happens on that tenuous plane of existence where the easy answers we give ourselves don’t fit, where we don’t pretend that everything makes sense; when, instead of telling a friend that his stress is like everyone else’s, we listen, ask questions, and show a desire to understand. Relationships are built through presence, from the courage to be vulnerable, through the tender moments that we don’t expect. The sum of the seemingly irrelevant moments we occupy is always greater than the sum of the momentous ones, whether we are at Harvard or not. By neglecting them, or by universalizing our experience, we run the risk of forgetting where real life is lived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Before I learned that kissing a girl was not a provisional and thus inferior form of makeout, this question perplexed me to no end: Who was your first kiss?
 Now I understand it was Deborah, on a summer night, by the swimming pool, but that didn’t sink in exactly until I was 18 or so—well past the ages my straight friends, recalling their 13-year-old makeout stories as party tricks, cited. Before that, every time this came up in truth or dare or casual let’s-share-our-feelings, I was hesitant. Was it Henry, who kissed the very side of my mouth during spin the bottle on Becky’s trampoline in eighth grade? Or George, whose cheek kiss turned into a brief mouth peck because I turned my head the wrong way? Or was it the elderly man I met one summer in high school who forced his tongue in my mouth and whose hand squeezed my breast, representing “the furthest I’d ever gone” with a boy?
 There’s a broader trend in my adolescent confusion: the notion that sexuality is and can always be a form of self-expression; that it is and can always be something chosen; and that there are some more-or-less legitimate forms of it separated from the axis of consent. For me the question of a first kiss, a first “makeout,” was never as straightforward as it seemed to be to my straight peers, and it was even more complicated by experience with sexualized force. Countless others feel similar dissonance—a more involved, perhaps more hurtful, set of happenings than the linear narrative we are taught.
 At first, identifying with these standardized narratives of sexual development might appear daring, cool, feminist, even. For women, sharing sexual exploits and adventures can indicate that we have moved beyond the prudery of past generations. For queers, so often excluded from viewing our sex as “real,” there can be a swaggering assertion of LGBT identity—we, too, have a body that counts. Of course, conversations about sexual experience, if conducted with frankness and sensitivity to a wide range of possibilities, can be helpful.
 Yet when we replicate models of sexual linearity, we reinforce the idea that sexual activity happens on a trajectory from “purity” to “experience.” This logic implies that when sexuality isn’t chosen or enjoyed, or when, as in the “first kiss” story, there is no clear-cut transition from innocence to experience, we are in a state of deviance, one for which we are partly responsible.
 We are taught in sexual education courses, for example, that the choice of abstinence is the only guaranteed way to avoid pregnancy and sexually-transmitted infections. Yet for an overwhelming number of young people, this choice is not available. Indeed, about one in four students in the American public school system receive abstinence only sexual education. But according to the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, 44 percent of sexual assault or rape victims are under the age of 18. Similar studies reveal that 7 percent of girls from grades five to eight, along with 12 percent of female high-schoolers, report sexual abuse. RAINN also estimates that among victims of rape in 2012, 17,342 experienced unwanted pregnancies.
 For these students, abstinence-only models may well prove especially alienating. And even for those educated in the 77 percent of public schools that do teach contraceptive methods, a message of choice that neglects to consider the topic of consent is inadequate. While sexual education programs are vitally necessary, despite their embattled status in America’s public schools, care must be taken that curricula do not reinforce the dichotomy between “purity” and “experience”: that discussion of STIs, for example, does not equate infection with physical or moral “dirtiness,” and that programs acknowledge a whole range of consensual sexual activity. 
 Rather than approach sex ed in a manner prone to alienate those most vulnerable, educational models that acknowledge that choice is sometimes limited can in fact reinforce a fuller sense of agency in a sometimes hostile world (approaches called “trauma-informed”). And we ourselves can alter the way we talk about sexuality on a daily basis, shifting the emphasis to the complexities of sometimes-devastating, sometimes-wonderful personal experience and away from the myth of the first kiss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Democratic candidates for governor in Massachusetts took their first formal step toward Election Day last weekend with the kickoff of the party’s multi-week caucuses, political experts said that Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley and Treasurer Steven Grossman have emerged as frontrunners.
Lawrence S. DiCara '71, former Boston city councilor, said he predicted that Coakley and Grossman, who have both been elected statewide for public office before, will emerge with the strongest support at the caucuses “because they know the players.”
Candidates must secure the vote of at least 15 percent of delegates at the caucus to be officially named to the ballot. DiCara and others said that Coakley and Grossman are likely lock-ins to make it onto the Democratic primary ballot.
Each of the candidates, with Coakley as the exception, studied at various Harvard schools, including the College, the Business School, the Law School, the Medical School, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
The other three candidates include Donald M. Berwick ’68, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Joseph Avellone, senior vice president at clinical research organization PAREXEL, and Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, a columnist on leave from her appointment as a lecturer at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Kayyem is also married to Law School professor David J. Barron '89, a former president of The Crimson.
 
“She’s got the poll numbers, and he’s got the money,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a Massachusetts democratic strategist, of Coakley and Grossman. Marsh, a consultant at the left-leaning Dewey Square Group, predicted that they are “the two people who will make it no matter what.”
 
Grossman raised $212,455 in December, bringing his accessible funds to $984,371, just over double the $455,771 available to Coakley.
A WBUR Boston poll from late January found that 53 percent of a group of 504 registered voters had a favorable opinion of Coakley and 22 percent felt favorably towards Grossman.
Still, this year’s election proves to be different from those prior in that “there is no frontrunner,” DiCara said. In recent primaries, a clear frontrunner, like Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, emerged early on.
Neither Coakley nor Grossman “have been able to amass the kind of head of steam that Deval Patrick had,” DiCara said.
“The poll will suggest that Coakley is far out in front, but I’m not so sure that holds with party activists,” DiCara said.
DiCara said that all candidates ultimately must win over unenrolled voters in Mass., who are not necessarily represented in the caucuses, but who ultimately may choose to vote in the Democratic primaries.
Those who attend caucuses tend to be “organized folks, party regulars,” DiCara said.
Small Democratic caucuses will proceed throughout the state through March, culminating in the Massachusetts Democratic Convention this June in Worcester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The annual freshmen formal came to an abrupt close Friday night when the venue’s staff, citing high intoxication levels among formal attendees, decided to end the event one hour early.
“The Great Gala,” a Great Gatsby-themed party, was scheduled to last from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. at the Seaport Boston Hotel, but hotel staff chose to end the formal at midnight, said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
“One student had gone to an area hospital for intoxication, and a handful of other students were sick,” Dingman said. “For [the hotel], that was sufficient to end the formal.”
According to a statement emailed to The Crimson from the First-Year Social Committee, approximately 1200 students attended the formal, marking a record-high number of tickets sold.
“The formal unfortunately had to end an hour early due to the hotel's concerns about safety issues and liability related to intoxicated students,” the statement read. “The hotel thought it apt to end the event early so that the situation could be dealt with as swiftly and carefully as possible."
Freshmen who attended the event remarked that an unexpected announcement signaled an early end to the night.
“I wasn’t on the dance floor when they announced it, but I heard that they made an announcement to go home,” Gabriela Diaz-Quinones ’17 said. She said that members of the First Year Social Committee subsequently informed guests to retrieve their coats and return to campus, adding that she and other freshmen were confused about what had transpired.
“No one has informed us of anything,” Diaz-Quinones said. “We have no idea what happened, or if anything happened.”
Janae A. Hughes ’17 said someone announced from the stage, “‘You guys have to go. Too many of you are smashed.’”
Hughes said she thought freshmen straying out of the dance area and into other parts of the hotel may have caused problems with the hotel.
“I didn’t see [visible intoxication] inside the party, but I think people were outside in the hotel area, and that’s where the problem was,” Hughes said.
Despite its early ending, Dingman said that he considered the formal to be a “very well-managed event.”
“I thought that the majority of freshmen conducted themselves beautifully,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Seaport Boston Hotel could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 12, 2014, at 2:42 a.m.
If there was a student who could master the art of balancing courses, extracurriculars, and a social life better than the rest, it was Angela R. Mathew ’15, her friends remember.
Mathew, a neurobiology concentrator from Albuquerque, N.M., who hoped to become a doctor, died early Monday morning in a traffic collision on the New Jersey Turnpike while traveling back to Harvard from a mock trial tournament in Virginia. She was 20.
Friends remember Mathew as a committed student, a dedicated contributor to the campus community, and a friend with an infectious spirit who was simply a joy to be around.
“Right when I first met her, I was like, ‘you’re that girl, you’re the one who is absolutely stunning,’” said friend Peter F. Barfield Jr. ’15. “She just had a personality that is so magnetic. You wanted to learn more about her.”
Kaleigh N. Henry ’15, who lived with Mathew in Leverett House, agreed. “She just had this spirit,” Henry said. “People were attracted to her and wanted to be with her.”
“She was a very special girl,” added Ryan P. Kelly ’15. “I know I’ll never have a friend like Angela again.”
Mathew was a presence all over campus, friends say. In addition to serving as a director of the Harvard Mock Trial Association’s high school seminar program, she was president of the Harvard College Science Club for Girls, Harvard’s chapter of a mentoring organization that connects college scientists to K-12 students. She was also involved with Harvard Model Congress Boston and was an inactive Crimson magazine editor.
“Semesters later, the girls she taught previously would still come running up to hug her whenever they saw her at the school,” Meredith A. MacGregor, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who worked with Mathew on the board of Science Club for Girls, wrote in an email.
“Even if she had only had [less than] 4 hours of sleep before clubs, which happened often since she was so involved and put her whole heart into everything she did, she was always so full of energy and life,” Stephanie L. Lim ’14 and Elizabeth S. Dunkel ’14, two other members of the board, wrote in their own email.
“She really devoted her heart to everything she did,” Henry said. “If she joined something, she immediately flourished and excelled at it.”
Mathew had spent the weekend competing with the Harvard Mock Trial Association at a competition in Richmond, Va. The junior impressed at the event, winning an “outstanding witness” award and helping Harvard to first place overall.
While in high school at Albuquerque Academy, Mathew was a National Merit semifinalist and involved in speech and debate. At the 2011 Harvard Invitational, she was a semifinalist in dramatic interpretation.
But at Harvard, Mathew’s friends remember her for always making time for them, even with a packed schedule of commitments.
“She was very selfless, but at the same time...she was extremely relatable,” Henry said. “She was a beautiful girl.”
Mathew is survived by her parents and her brother. The Mathew family could not be reached for comment Monday evening.
A memorial service for Mathew and a 2006 College alumnus who dies on campus last Thursday will be held at 7:00 p.m. Wednesday in Memorial Church.

Prayer not only offers spiritual benefits but can also function as a placebo and provide physical advantages, professors said at a panel Tuesday afternoon entitled “Placebo and Prayer: Why Prayer Practice May Help Heal.”
 
At the event, the third installment of a five-part series of seminars on placebos funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Stanford University Professor of Anthropology Tanya M. Luhrmann spoke first about her research on the effect of prayer on the lives of evangelical Christians in the United States.
 
Drawing from various studies, Luhrmann said she was hesitant about the implications of the word ‘placebo,’ but noted that there is direct evidence that going to church increases life expectancy, improves immune system functions, and lowers blood pressure.
 
“Placebo is a terrible word. It suggests a false intervention with a surprise outcome,” she said.
 
Besides these physical benefits, Luhrmann also said that she often sees an active effort to emphasize the positive instead of the negative when praying.
 
“[Positive prayer] doesn't always work, but what you see is an effort to redirect your attention and see what is good,” Luhrmann said.
 
Luhrmann added that while prayer can serve as a real “emotional management system,” the success of the process as a placebo often involves seeing God as personal, believable, and real.
 
“Abstract belief is easy…but to feel that God is close and present is hard,” Luhrmann, noting that prayer is an intricate “meta-cognitive activity.”
 
Later in the event, professors and fellow panelists Arthur M. Kleinman, Anne Harrington '82, and Ted J. Kaptchuk responded to Luhrmann’s points with findings from their own work in anthropology, history of science, and medicine respectively.
 
The panelists discussed the need for personal belief and practice to ensure that prayers become effective placebos.
Kaptchuk, who conducts trials to test the effectiveness of placebos in different environments, said that even when a placebo drug is administered to the patient who is fully aware that the pill is merely sugar, the placebo is still effective.
 
Harrington, who pointed towards the history of miraculous healings at Lourdes, France, asked how special healings relate to Luhrmann’s findings. Often, Harrington said, sick individuals are reluctant to be brought to Lourdes to be healed, and only begin believing in the power of prayer after the visit.
 
For her part, Luhrmann continued to emphasize the ability of positive prayer to act as a placebo.
 
“Think about prayer as a way of paying attention to your mind,” she said.

As the newly released plans for the Dunster House renewal take shape and construction on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall continues to progress, University President Drew G. Faust said on Tuesday that Harvard’s focus for House Renewal, at least for the time being, remains on the river.
“We want to get these [River] Houses done first because they are older and more in need of attention [ than the Quad],” Faust said in an interview with The Crimson.
Renovation on Leverett’s McKinlock Hall remains on track to be completed by August, according to Assistant Dean of FAS Physical Resources Merle Bicknell. After a recent visit to the construction site, Bicknell detailed many of the improvements to McKinlock in an email to The Crimson, including the replacement of the older storm windows with new insulated glass windows that conserve energy while blocking out street commotion and maximizing the natural lighting of the rooms.
She wrote that one of the most exciting facets of the renewal involves the transformation of the noisy, outdoor alleyway into a “light court” and overflow dining area enclosed in glass. The upgraded building will also feature additional performance spaces, music practice rooms, student lounges, and a technological update and modernization of the Old Library Theatre.
Bicknell added that the renewal plans have evolved with student input, incorporating feedback on suite and bathroom mock-ups.
 
According to both Faust and Bicknell, construction on McKinlock has provided the University with a “test project” for future renovations, much like the remodeling of Quincy’s Stone Hall last year. Bicknell said that Quincy offered a test of residential renewal, while McKinlock serves the different function of housing “program spaces,” like a dining hall, common room, and theater, and the renovation of both types of spaces has informed plans for the Dunster House renewal, which will begin in June.
“So the notion is really to go through this process learning as we go, starting with a fairly small endeavor—about 180 students I believe—in Stone Hall and then moving to a full house,” Faust said.
Bicknell said that McKinlock is home to a historic interior that demands particular attention. The renovation of McKinlock and other upcoming River House projects focus on maintaining a balance between improving the space for current students and remaining faithful to the historical identities of the Houses. According to Bicknell, preserving and restoring the unique character of the rooms, such as McKinlock’s old library, is one of the dominant goals of House Renewal.
“But things have certainly changed since these Houses were built in the 1930s,” she wrote. “We want to support today’s students.”
According to Leverett House Master Howard Georgi, construction has been disruptive to student life in Leverett House.
“The renovation team has tried hard to minimize the problems, but it is very difficult,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.
He stated that two of the most significant challenges have been the amount of students residing in swing housing, making it difficult to connect with sophomores new to the House, and the loss of large common spaces, which has resulted in the postponement of many House functions.
Georgi added that Leverett staff has tried to work around the roadblocks caused by construction, citing the giant “Tour de Lev” study break, which spanned Leverett buildings and swing spaces, as an example of how the House has tried to keep students connected to the Leverett community.
Georgi wrote that he is looking forward to more accessible common space in the newly renovated McKinlock, and that Leverett will soon have to determine how to best utilize the updated common space and create new House traditions.

Harvard and Boston College faculty members have written a letter encouraging Congress to pass the Children in Families First Act, which aims to reform the adoption system in the United States.
34 faculty members from Harvard Law School and 24 from Boston Law School signed and sent the letter last week, according to a Law School press release.
The act—which was introduced by Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana last October and has since progressed to committee—seeks to streamline the adoption process and place children with families faster. The language of the bill highlights the fundamental human right of every child to a permanent family.
While drafting the bill, Landrieu solicited advice and recommendations from two academics—Elizabeth Bartholet '62, a professor of public interest law at Harvard Law School, and Paulo Barrozo, an assistant professor of law at Boston College.
“[Bartholet and Barrozo] have been heavily involved in CHIFF since its inception,” said a Senator Landrieu staffer, who requested anonymity due to an internal office policy. “Their wisdom and thought process have helped bring [the bill] to fruition.”
Bartholet and Barrozo eventually decided to approach their colleagues to solicit support for the legislation.
“The core human rights principles of the legislation were so important that we thought our colleagues would also agree to support these principles,” Barrozo said.
 
The legislation is particularly timely, Bartholet said, given that the number of adoptions has dropped dramatically since 2004—a decrease that Bartholet attributes to the slow bureaucratic procedures surrounding adoptions. Bartholet added that the federal government has proved hesitant to permit international adoptions.
 
“This is a human rights tragedy of enormous proportions,” Bartholet said in the press release. “This legislation is truly the light at the end of a long tunnel of despair.”
Bartholet, who serves as the faculty director for the child advocacy program at Harvard Law School,  began working with Barrozo on human rights issues and pro bono work while Barrozo was a student at Harvard Law School.
They now hope that the letter will ensure that Congress keeps the most important aspects of the legislation in the final bill.
“The importance of the letter is to identify those principles that are very important and to prevent those principles from dropping,” said Bartholet, who said she feared that Congress might remove some crucial portions of the bill.
Despite this concern, Barrozo and Bartholet remain optimistic that Congress will pass the Act.
“There’s a great level of support—it’s growing—and there is momentum,” Barrozo said.
She noted that the bill has attracted a wide range of supporters, including both Democratic and Republican co-sponsors in the House and the Senate.
“It definitely has bipartisan support,” Bartholet said. “I’m hopeful it will be passed.”
The Landrieu staffer praised the efforts of the Harvard and Boston College faculties.
 
“They are one persuasive and influential voice among many that are now joining the choir,” the staffer said. “I think members of Congress will respond.”

A year after University administrators announced that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would move to Allston, faculty members and administrators from the school outlined a vision for an innovative campus across the Charles that accommodates the needs of 21st-century academics and marries the leafy quads of Cambridge with Silicon Valley’s adaptable infrastructure.
The vision, laid out in a Jan. 20 draft report by the SEAS Teaching and Community Space Task Force obtained by The Crimson, calls specifically for the creation of classroom spaces that will allow for “active learning” and the incorporation of recreational areas that would help make the campus a destination for College students and a round-the-clock education center.
In planning the Allston campus, which is not expected to open until the 2017-2018 academic year, the report emphasized the importance of avoiding spaces that could only be used for one purpose or “state of the art” rooms that resisted structural changes. Instead, the report’s authors advocated for easily partitionable areas that could be upgraded as technology improves, such that the building could change along with the School.
“Right now nothing is as big a constraint on pedagogical innovation in SEAS as the difficulty in finding flat-floor classrooms that can be fitted with lightweight tables and chairs,” they wrote.
At the same time, designing spaces where students can rest and socialize between classes is an important priority, the task force reported. To that end, the draft includes plans for spaces like a forum, a permanent dining facility, a fitness center, and even showers. It also calls for an interior courtyard with possible game spaces and underground parking facilities, in addition to more conventional office and meeting space.
 
“Allston should feel like home to both students and faculty,” the authors wrote. “A home is not luxurious necessarily, but is fully appointed with the comforts and attractions of a place students and faculty want to go to, return to, and never leave.”
The document emphasizes the need to attract College students, in particular, to Allston, which Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said had the possibility of becoming an “engineering ghetto.”
Lewis, also the report’s lead author, added that, "[Allston] has to be seen as a cool place to go for undergraduates so they will go and hang out and stay.”
According to physics professor David A. Weitz, creativity is key in making the prospective SEAS campus attractive to students.
“As long as we make it the most exciting place there is, you’ll come, you’ll not mind,” he said.
 
While the draft acknowledged that Allston’s distance might appear challenging at this point in time, it emphasized that the potential benefits of the area have yet to be explored.
 
Co-signed by 13 SEAS faculty members and administrators, including the School’s dean, Cherry A. Murray, the draft report was circulated to both University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan E. Garber ’76, according to Paul Karoff, the School’s communications director and a co-signatory. Karoff characterized the response to the paper as very positive.
“[The draft] does a nice job of encapsulating the aspirations of faculty and staff,” Karoff said. Lewis said that faculty members have also reacted positively to the paper’s proposals.
Many faculty members were taken aback by news of the move to Allston when it was announced at a Faculty meeting in February 2013. At the time, the decision was characterized as the “Allston Bomb” by many SEAS faculty members. Garber subsequently created three task forces to examine issues related to the move.

In its final Ivy League matchup of the season, the No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team (15-0, 7-0 Ivy) took down No. 19 Brown (4-14, 0-7), 9-0, on Sunday afternoon at the Murr Athletic Center. With the victory, the Crimson completed its season sweep of the Ancient Eight. The Crimson took home the Ivy League title for the second straight season.
In all but one match in the lineup, Harvard swept its Brown opponents in three consecutive games. In the previous 23 Brown-Harvard matchups, the Crimson has managed to come out on top each time and the past five contests, the Crimson has shut out the Bears without a single dropped match.
“Squash is one of those games where if there’s a discrepancy in levels it becomes obvious who will be likely to win,” co-captain Gary Power said. “The best teams and the best players tend to be more likely to win than in other sports. Between Yale on Fridayand Brown today, it was more thinking about how to recover from tough matches, and preparation for more tough matches in the future.”
For the fifth line player, freshman Bryan Koh, victory did not come so easily. After winning each of the first two games by a two-point margin, Koh went on to drop the next two games to tie the match, 2-2. After a hard-fought fifth game, Koh managed to reverse his losing streak and prevailed against Brown’s Alex Baldock with a 12-10 final game score for the 3-2 win.
After the match, coach Michael Way said that the final margin did not properly reflect the competitiveness of the matches, citing Koh’s contest as an example.
“[Bryan Koh] had a very tough match to play because his opponent was very strong,” Way said. “I think the scoreline does absolutely no justice to how good [Brown’s] team really is, and Bryan’s match went right down the wire to 12-10 in the fifth game, so it was very close. The scoreline doesn’t reflect it, but some of the guys still had to work to get the job done.”
In the top four spots, co-captain Brandon McLaughlin, Power, and classmates Ali Farag and Nigel Koh shut out their opponents, 3-0, to finish off Brown. On the year, the four have combined for a record of 45-4. In McLaughlin’s match, the co-captain dropped only eight points en route to the fifth win for the Crimson, clinching the Harvard victory.
After Power’s first loss in the Yale game, his match against Brown’s Oliver Booth started a new winning streak for the senior. This was Power’s 12th victory this season, and he is now tied with Farag for the second most wins on the Harvard squad this season.
“The game was pretty straightforward,” Power said. “I think winning the Ivy title was just a sign of how well we played in the other matches such as at Trinity and Yale. It was good to bounce for the win back since I lost on Friday for the first time this season, which I wasn’t happy about.”
In the sixth spot, sophomore Nick Hopcroft defeated the Brown Bears’ Tod Holberton in straight sets to bump his season record to 11-1. Hopcroft prevented his opponent from scoring a single point in the second game and dropped only seven points overall. 
At the seventh line, senior Tom Mullaney won in straight sets, outplaying Brown’s Nick Talbott and shutting him out completely in the third game, 11-0. Mullaney leads the Crimson with 13 victories on the season, playing anywhere between the sixth and ninth lines for the team. 
At the eighth and ninth positions, sophomores Matt Roberts and Sam Goldberg got the opportunity to play in matches that counted towards the final tally. Both Roberts and Goldberg secured wins to contribute to the championship game win.
“[The Ivy title presentation] was nice,” Power said. “But I think the Ivy title is something we would have been more disappointed not to win, and right now we’re more focused on the national title for next weekend. It’s great to win the Ivy title, but the title we want is next weekend.”
The Crimson’s perfect record marks the 25th undefeated season in Harvard men’s squash program history. In nine of its 15 matches this season, the Crimson did not relinquish a single game. By comparison, Harvard had 10 9-0 victories in 20 contests last season.
“I think I am as proud of their victories and accomplishments as I am of the way they handled themselves in their victories,” Way said. “They carried themselves well in not just a professional manner, but with such modesty. They’re respectful, and I just think it speaks volumes in the way they handle themselves, especially in the tougher matches.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After starting its spring season with two losses, the Harvard men’s tennis team (2-2) turned things around, defeating both No. 39 Minnesota (4-4) and No. 34 Tulsa (6-4) on the road.
The No. 25 Crimson showcased its depth and resilience in the two matches, and ultimately won twice by an identical 4-3 score. 
The team relied on contributions from every spot in its lineup after losing the doubles point in both contests. 
“Everyone did a good job battling this weekend,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “After not playing well in doubles, everyone did a good job coming back in singles.”
HARVARD 4, TULSA 3
On Sunday, the Crimson squeaked by the Golden Hurricanes at the Golden Gophers’ Baseline Tennis Center. Harvard, which scrimmaged with Tulsa in September at the Harvard Chowder Fest, has now defeated the Golden Hurricane in four of the five all-time matchups. 
For the second straight day, the Crimson adjusted to the unfamiliar position of being behind when singles play started. The team won 19 of its 25 doubles points last year, and consistently captured the doubles point throughout the fall season. 
But co-captain Casey MacMaster and junior Denis Nguyen, ranked 17th in the nation among doubles tandems, fell on the first court. Steinroeder and freshman Sebastian Beltrame won to knot up the score, but freshman Brian Yeung and sophomore Nicky Hu fell to give Tulsa the doubles point. 
“If you would’ve told me we would lose the doubles point two days in a row and still win [both matches] 4-3, I’d have been quite surprised,” coach Dave Fish said. 
In singles, freshman Andrew Ball struck first, evening the match with a 6-3, 6-2 win. Steinroeder followed suit, but Yeung fell to tie the match at 2-2.Beltrame then won in three sets, but junior Shaun Chaudhuri could not hang on, leaving the match up to Nguyen, Harvard’s top singles player. 
Nguyen had match point in the second set, but could not convert and eventually lost the set in a tiebreaker, 7-5.  In the final set, he broke his opponent while up 5-3 to take the match and give the Crimson the 4-3 win. 
“Denis has done a really great job stepping up at the number one position,” Steinroeder said. “He fought really hard and had a great win today against a good opponent.”
HARVARD 4, MINNESOTA 3
On Saturday, Harvard took down Minnesota by a point, handing the Golden Gophers their second one-point loss of the weekend. 
The match started off poorly for the Crimson, with Minnesota’s Jack Hamburg and Mathieu Froment upsetting MacMaster and Nguyen in doubles, 6-4. Sophomores Conor Haughey and Kelvin Lam were the next casualties, falling by the same score and spotting the Golden Gophers a 1-0 lead.
“[Hamburg and Froment] just came out really strong in doubles,” Steinroeder said. “We were a little rusty to start off. Overall, it was just an off weekend in doubles.”
The bad start would carry over to singles, where Chaudhuri quickly lost, 6-2, 6-3. But Nguyen began the team’s turnaround with a 6-4, 6-4 win. Next, Yeung and Steinroeder won on the fourth and fifth courts, respectively, to give Harvard a 3-2 advantage. 
But Beltrame lost in at the third position, evening the match and leaving it up to Ball at the sixth slot. Although Minnesota’s Jeremy Lynn fought till the end, Ball prevailed in a second-set tiebreaker, 11-9, in a 6-3, 6-5(9) triumph. 
Depth was a key theme for Harvard over the weekend. While Saturday’s match came down to Ball in the sixth position, Sunday’s was decided by Nguyen at the top line. 
Aided by strong play from its whole lineup and timely contributions from its three freshmen, the squad is poised to make noise as it continues its spring season and pursues its third consecutive Ivy League title. 
“After this weekend, we feel confident,” Steinroeder said. “At the same time, there are things we didn’t do well, and we’ll figure out where we need to be. But now we definitely have the confidence that we can be a top team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard men’s hockey team (8-12-3, 4-9-3 ECAC) found itself in a familiar place Monday evening against Boston University  (8-16-4, 3-8-3 Hockey East) at the TD Garden.
Playing in its sixth straight consolation game and its 15th in 16 years, the Crimson faced the Terriers in the consolation match of the annual Beanpot tournament for the second straight campaign and third time in four years.
Like last season, Harvard trailed BU at the first intermission after the Terriers struck first at 10:42. The goal was the only score in the period and Harvard trailed, 1-0, after 20 minutes.
But the second period was another story, as the Crimson erupted for three goals in the first seven minutes, continuing the offensive dominance Harvard has shown against BU in its past four matchups. In fact, the Crimson has netted 26 goals in these four games, all Harvard victories.
The Terriers attempted to mount a comeback in the third period, scoring at 7:20 to cut the deficit to two. However, the Crimson responded with a goal of its own just 37 seconds after the BU strike, making the score 4-2 and ending any momentum that BU had just gained. Harvard went on to add two more goals in the final three minutes of the game to cap off a 6-2 victory.
“I think we are happy to get the win,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought our guys battled. We threw a lot of pucks at the net. I thought our hard work got rewarded with a couple bounces, as well. We are happy to get the win and hopefully it will help us coming down the stretch.”
With its fourth straight third-place finish in the Beanpot, Harvard won consecutive games for the first time this year. It also recorded its second victory after trailing after one period, both wins coming against the Terriers. In previous years, the Crimson defeated BU in the 2011 and 2013 consolation matches.
Sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek stopped 25 shots for Harvard, becoming the first Crimson goalie since the turn of the century to win two career Beanpot games. Harvard’s penalty kill shutout the Terriers, 0-3, improving to 82-94 (87.2 percent) on the season, good for fifth in the nation.
Early on in the first period, the Crimson showcased strong play, leading the Terriers shots, 10-5. But midway through the period, Terrier Evan Rodrigues fired a one-time wrist shot past Michalek after receiving a pass from Robbie Baillargeon.
In the second period, sophomore Kyle Criscuolo began the scoring onslaught for Harvard, beating BU goalie Sean Maguire with a slapshot from the top of the right circle at 1:14 that tied up the game at one goal apiece.
“[Criscuolo] actually looked at me right before we went out for the second and said ‘I got one here’,” said freshman linemate Luke Esposito, who had two goals of his own. “And sure enough, first shift he rung one off the post.”
Sophomore Brian Hart soon followed just over two minutes later, sending a shot from near the crease through Maguire’s five-hole to give Harvard its first lead of the night, one that it would not relinquish all evening.
Esposito took advantage of a rebound off a shot by Criscuolo, making it 3-1 for the Crimson, scoring one of the three goals the two combined for on the evening. 
“It’s nice playing with guys with that much speed and that kind of work ethic, [who are as] relentless on the puck as Kyle and [sophomore] Greg Gozzo [are],” Esposito said. “So it just makes it easier whether you are that high guy or that guy helping him.”
Ahti Oksanen, who leads the Terriers in points, cut Harvard’s lead to two with a goal. Oksanen scored while gliding down the left side after receiving a pass across the ice from Rodrigues.
But the Crimson benefited from a fortunate bounce soon after, as BU captain Ryan Macgregor deflected a shot from Esposito that redirected past Maguire and into the net. The Terriers could not find the net after this, and Harvard scored an empty net goal from sophomore Jimmy Vesey, as well as a goal from freshman Tyler Moy with 26 seconds left in the game.
This contest also marks the final nonconference game of the season for Harvard. It looks once again to use the consolation game victory to drive some momentum for the final six games of the regular season.
“Last week was very disappointing but I thought our guys bounced back,” Donato said. “We are a young team and we are constantly improving…. But most importantly, I think we are trying to get some momentum so we are playing our best hockey at the end of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Participating in a sport that is focused entirely on time, it was fitting that seniors Kyle Krueger and Paige Newell ended their swimming careers not necessarily thinking about how fast they were swimming, but about how they had arrived at this moment.
 
These seniors, along with five other underclassmen, swam at the Virginia Tech Invitational, their personal championship meet, in Blacksburg, VA while the rest of their team stayed behind in preparation for the Ivy League Championship.
 
Both Krueger and Newell spent the weekend making and recalling memories, as they tried to appreciate the final moments of their swim careers, which began over 15 years ago.
 
“I think Paige and I were very reflective in this meet, and really tried to soak up all the enjoyment and all the little things,” Krueger said. “We tried to remember how much we enjoy swimming and swimming for Harvard. It was definitely bittersweet, and strange to be swimming our last race but it was a nice, fitting way for us to wrap up our last season.”
 
Krueger placed fourth in the 100 breaststroke on Saturday and sixth in Sunday’s 200 breaststroke race, while Newell placed second in the 1650 freestyle. After they scored top eight finishes in multiple events, assistant coach Amanda Kulik described the seniors’ performances as inspirational for the younger swimmers who learned from their advice.
 
“While this meet was a great opportunity for them to race again, it was a way for them to give their heart and soul in the pool,” Kulik said. “It was a very challenging meet for both of them, because they had to try to swim with the bittersweet emotions.”
 
The Harvard representation in the pool may have been small, but Kulik described the team’s presence on deck as quite the opposite.
 
“We were only nine people there, but we sounded like we were as big as Virginia Tech who had about 40 athletes,” Kulik said. “They were very excited coming on deck, and being able to be heard. It’s always about the times, but [this weekend] was more about racing with heart and racing with passion and racing for themselves, and racing for everyone on the team, either here or back home. And a lot of them raced for the seniors, for Kyle and Paige.”
 
Top finishes over the weekend include freshman Margaret Chory’s second-place finish in the 100 backstroke and her first place finish in the 200 backstroke.
 
“We had great swims across the board,” Krueger said. “[Chory] was the winner of her event on Sunday and came back in a really exciting race to chase down two other girls in the last 50 and post a really solid swim, so we were really happy for her.”
 
With competition from within the Crimson in multiple races, Newell she was even more motivated racing alongside her teammates. Freshman Daniela Suarez-Rebling finished just ahead of Newell in first place in the 1650 freestyle, while freshman Savannah Butler twice finished behind Krueger in the 100 and 200 breaststroke races.
 
“What’s not always displayed in swimming results are the smaller fights that take place throughout the race, or even between the fifth and sixth spot,” Newell said. “On a team, we push each other in practice every day, so when you get the opportunity to race with your teammate in a high pressure situation ... you can see the swimmers looking to each other for strength.”
 
Although Harvard’s official captains were absent from the meet, Kulik explained that nothing changed relating to leadership on the team.
 
“Everyone in that senior class is a leader,” Kulik said. “They’ve each taught the underclassmen something, whether it be about their swims or about their personal lives. This meet, [Krueger and Newell] wanted to share their advice and wisdom about just how special it is to have the opportunity to compete at the Division I level and what it means to be a Harvard swimmer.”
 
With guidance from their departing seniors, the underclassmen used the meet to take note of areas to improve for next season as well.
 
“For those that are coming back, we have some great things they discovered in themselves in the pool; we know what we need to work on in the future,” Kulik said. “I’m incredibly proud of this group of women. Not only the women here, but the women at home, and how they are incredible competitors and fighters. It was really heartwarming to see the interactions unfold.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Following a dismal showing against Northeastern in the first round of the 62nd annual Beanpot tournament last week, the Harvard men’s hockey team (8-12-3, 4-9-3 ECAC) made sure that it would not leave the TD Garden empty-handed Monday night.
 
After allowing six goals to the Huskies in the opener, the Crimson came up with six scores of its own this time around to cruise past Boston University (8-16-4, 3-8-3 Hockey East) in the consolation game, 6-2.
 
Although Harvard has now gone 21 years without a Beanpot title, the victory marks the team’s fourth consecutive win in the consolation game, three of which have come over the Terriers.
 
“Nothing that happened tonight will erase last week’s tough memory, but I thought our guys came out, worked hard, and enabled us to get the victory,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
 
BALANCE BEATS BU 
 In the first matchup between these two teams this season, 11 members of the Crimson recorded points as Harvard emerged victorious at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, 7-4.
 
In the rematch, the Crimson offense was just as explosive as nine Harvard skaters notched at least a point, including five who were held without one in the first meeting. Among these five were freshman forward Luke Esposito, who notched two goals and an assist, and sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo, who lit the lamp once and assisted on two more.
 
“[Esposito and I] both had our chances the first time we played them, that’s for sure,” Criscuolo said. “Going into this game, we were definitely trying to shoot the puck a little more knowing we didn’t want to give up any more opportunities, and [we] wanted to be involved in the win tonight.”
 
All 18 players who suited up for Harvard Monday night have now notched points against BU in their collegiate careers. This surplus of production has led the Crimson to tally 26 goals in its last four games against the Terriers, which represent the team’s four highest scoring outputs of the last two seasons.
 
“[I was disappointed] with our lack of preparation [because we had] an opportunity to play in a game where obviously we haven’t beaten Harvard in two years,” BU coach David Quinn said. “[But] Harvard was the better team tonight.”
 
CALL IT A COMEBACK
 
Just over half way through the first period, the Terriers got the scoring started. Finding an opening in the slot, BU forward Evan Rodrigues received forward Robbie Baillargeon’s dish from behind the net and beat Harvard sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek, giving the Terriers an early lead.
 
Prior to this contest, the Crimson had been 1-9-2 in games where it surrendered the game’s first goal. Furthermore, the team had only won one contest in which it had trailed at any point all season. That victory came against none other than the Terriers.
 
Harvard went into the first intermission still trailing by a goal, but the team quickly began firing on all cylinders early in the second. Criscuolo initiated the scoring at the 1:18 mark with a slapshot that got the best of Terrier goaltender Sean Maguire for his 11th score of the season.
 
Two minutes later, sophomore forward Brian Hart got in on the action when he put one through the pads of Maguire to give the Crimson the lead. Esposito also netted the first of his two goals in the second period, capitalizing on a rebound off a blast by junior Max Everson.
 
“I was happy that we were able to persevere and stay with it [after falling behind early],” Donato said. “I thought we played a smart game too, which is something that quite frankly hasn’t been a part of our DNA to this point.”
 
Rounding out the scoring for Harvard were sophomore Jimmy Vesey and freshman Tyler Moy, who both scored in the final 2:14 of the contest. Michalek stopped 25 of the 27 shots that he faced, becoming the first goaltender to win multiple Beanpot games for the Crimson in the last decade, while helping Harvard achieve its second come-from-behind victory of the season.
BU entered the game having stumbled as of late, earning just one victory in its previous 13 games, but following a competitive performance against Boston College last week, Quinn said that he expected a better showing from his team against Harvard.
 “We did not look alert,” Quinn said. “We just did not look like we were ready to play a hockey game, which is very, very disappointing.”

There are a few important rivalries in every Harvard student’s life: Harvard vs. Yale, The Crimson vs. The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, and now a new one that has entered the scene: Tasty Burger vs. Shake Shack.
Tasty Burger has already whetted students' appetites for greasy fast food, but will it survive the invasion of the chic New York eatery? Here's a comprehensive rating of Shake Shack and Tasty Burger to give you the inside scoop on the rivalry.
Price:
Shake Shack: $$$$The food at Shake Shack is definitely on the pricier side, so for students it might not fit in your budget. For a burger, fries, and shake, you can expect to pay at least $13.
Tasty Burger: $$$Tasty Burger’s prices are much less taxing on a student’s wallet. A burger, fries, and beer is around $10.
Burger Quality:
SS: ****We’d rate the food at this New York famous shack a solid four stars. The burgers taste much more fresh and flavorful than their competitor's "Tasty" Burger.
TB: **The burgers at Tasty Burger really aren’t anything special. If anything, I’d say the onion rings are what are really tasty; maybe they should consider changing their name to Tasty Rings.
Shake Quality:
SS: ****The custard used in the famous Shake Shack shake is the perfect ingredient for a four star shake. The blend of texture and taste is perfection.
TB: ***The shakes at Tasty Burger are delicious, but you could find a similar tasting shake at Mcdonald’s for a dollar.
Late night hours:
SS: **Unfortunately, Shake Shack hasn’t really figured out the whole late night Harvard food craving ordeal yet. Shake Shack closes at 11 p.m. every night, missing the post-midnight rush of stumbling students with the drunchies. We hope that they extend their hours ASAP.
TB: ****Open until 4 a.m. on weekends, Tasty Burger knows how to please the average late night Harvard student. It’s definitely a treat after a disappointing night at a final club.
Atmosphere:
SS: ****Whether you’re overlooking the Square on the top floor of the Shack, or sitting in a booth that resembles a New York diner, the atmosphere at Shake Shack is top notch and definitely deserves four stars.
TB: ***Though Tasty Burger does have quite the classic burger joint/diner feel, the overwhelming late night lines and unflattering fluorescent lighting take away from the quality of the atmosphere. But the downstairs bar certainly adds to its appeal.
Winner:
Shake Shack
With delicious burgers and a fresh ambiance, the new kid on the block has out-burgered the perennial favorite. Tasty Burger should watch its back.

Author B.J. Novak '01 signs a copy of his new book, "One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories" at his public book signing at the Harvard Book Store on Feb. 10.
Here's the past month of juicy college admissions news. Starting next Monday, check back weekly for our latest serving!
MICHELLE OBAMA WANTS TO GIVE YOU FREE MONEY. The first lady urged more kids to apply for federal financial aid,   dropping in on a room full of high schoolers and parents who were   filling out the FAFSA online to tell them, “Fill out those forms,   fill them out!”
FINANCIAL AID FIASCO. But despite the FLOTUS's encouragement, some colleges may have been misleading students to believe they needed to fill out (and pay for) the CSS/Financial Aid profile to qualify for federal aid. In reality, only the FAFSA is necessary. The Department of Education is currently reviewing the case.
HELP! WHICH COLLEGE SHOULD I PICK? Never fear, oh indecisive high  school senior: Whether you're worried about getting into graduate school,  making the big bucks, or figuring out who you'll hang out with on the weekends, The  New York Times has got you covered.
MORE LOW-INCOME STUDENTS AT TOP COLLEGES. That's the goal, anyway, of the 80 college and university presidents who met with our nation's president last month.
Obama believes that improvements in college access will help alleviate poverty and income inequality. One model for the future might be Franklin & Marshall College, which recruits (and provides ample financial aid to) top-performing, low-income high schoolers and has introduced measures to the level the playing field of campus life.
WHO IS A GOOD COLLEGE STUDENT? Typically, colleges want to admit students who "merit" admission and who will succeed, according to an Inside Higher Ed article. But what does "merit" mean, and who defines it? Some college administrators argue that so-called merit metrics, like standardized test scores and grades, favor wealthier students. Admitting more low-income students, though, can mean a drop in a college's rankings. However, Michigan State University dean Donald E. Heller points out that other groups, like athletes and legacies, are sometimes admitted with lower academic credentials than the rest of the student body.
ONLY LEADERS NEED APPLY. That's what you get when reading  American university admissions websites, says an Oxford student who  writes convincingly in The Atlantic that leadership bias obscures the merits of lone wolves and followers, and that college applicants might be suffering for it.
YOUR SAT CHEAT SHEET. A private college counselor breaks down when to prepare for tests, whether to take the SAT vs. ACT, and why getting a stellar score doesn't matter as much as you think it does.
BEATING THE ODDS. Students who attend a public college and who have less money, lower ACT and SAT scores, and a high school G.P.A. that fell below the top 25% of their class are less likely to graduate, according to U.S. News & World Report. But probabilities aren't everything. Here's a report card of regional institutions with higher (and lower) graduation rates than predicted.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. After months of Supreme Court cases and controversy, affirmative action has a new skirmish on the horizon. The California legislature has just approved a ballot measure that will let voters decide whether to repeal parts of the state's ban on using race and gender in college admissions decisions.
H.B.C.U. CHALLENGES. The New York Times covers how Howard University and other historically-black colleges and universities are handling growing economic problems and changing United States demographics. A White House initiative came up with one potential solution: It recently convinced the  Brazilian government to pay for 1,000 of its students to attend stateside  H.B.C.U.s for two years.
WHICH COLLEGES ALWAYS GET A 'YES'? U.S. News &  World Report has released the latest details on admissions yield numbers, which  you can think about as the likelihood the kid you accept to your college will say yes. Who are the top charmers in  higher education? For universities, it's Harvard and Brigham Young—Provo, and for liberal arts colleges, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Military Academy.  The snappy uniform wins them all over.
THE PERKS OF BEING A SOLDIER. Beyond  that uniform, military folk may be getting one more little party favor after years spent risking their lives in dehumanizing conditions: There's a bill  headed to the Senate that would guarantee in-state tuition rates at  public universities for vets.
