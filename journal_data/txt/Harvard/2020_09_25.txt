After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Post-campus eviction, there’s no better place on the internet for Harvard students to revel in college nostalgia than the Harvard Confessions Facebook page. Advertised as a place for “your deepest secrets,” the page allows students to anonymously post hopes, memories, regrets, frustrations, and anything else rant-worthy. Mid-lockdown, I started following the page, and feeling slightly delirious from isolation and likely overly sentimental, I admittedly found myself living vicariously through these angsty snippets of college life. Some posts told of moments from CVS or J.P. Licks and chance encounters in Harvard Square. Others mourned the loss of staring down dining hall crushes daily – crushes that posters claimed would have blossomed into beautiful relationships if only time had allowed. And some reminisced watching the sun come up from a Lamont Library window after a night of intense stress and study, which now in hindsight seems quite charming. These lighthearted recollections and other ironic, even nonsensical posts would make me laugh and uplift me – even if just momentarily – during dreary days of Zoom and banana bread baking.
But as I continued scrolling, other posts snapped me out of this romanticized Harvard. Posts recounting on-campus loneliness, isolation before quarantine, relationships or acquaintances lost to distance (but which couldn’t be recuperated for fear of looking “desperate”), academic failures, and social anxieties came up all too often. Some posters were angry that their political views were being dismissed, that beliefs they held weren’t in line with those of their friends, that they urgently needed to “shout into the void.” Some of the more concerning posts even expressed suicidal thoughts, descriptions of sexual assault, and abusive relationships. In all posts, though, what stood out most was that Harvard students were tremendously afraid to confess their truths and vulnerabilities without the safety of online anonymity. They didn’t want to speak directly to each other; they wanted to be heard free of judgement. And with a following of well over 3,000 people, the page is not just for a struggling minority. Our community members are paying attention — and they’re most likely relating to some of the content, too.
The truth is that we Harvard students are terrified to project any weakness without the veil of anonymity. Fear of failure practically runs in our veins. It’s no surprise; to get here in the first place we had to be perfect, avoiding failures at every turn. Some fear of failure is normal and beneficial in order to motivate us to accomplish the amazing things we do. However, being unable to admit emotional weakness to one another is unnatural and unhealthy. Students are rarely willing to admit “I don’t know.” Instead, we are enthusiastic to share interests and talk about what we’re good at — our campus is vibrant and diverse because of this.
But rarely do we want to tell our friends why we’re stressed (about something other than a problem set or paper, of course). We don’t want to pile heavy emotional baggage on friends because it might get them down, too, or even worse, they might not care about it as much as we do. To our own detriment, we see our unhappiness as emotional failure. The student who constantly thrives academically, extracurricularly, has plenty of friends, tons of connections, and never struggles emotionally is the perceived perfect Harvard student. But this ideal is probably not an entirely genuine person, if he or she exists at all. Rather, this perceived idealized persona makes campus toxic because we are striving to be someone who is essentially impossible to be — that is, someone who only succeeds and never feels, doubts, or gets discouraged.
Harvard Confessions is the only platform bringing this problem to light. Certainly, it’s a useful outlet for students to get anything off their chest. But it shouldn’t be the case that we only feel comfortable being vulnerable when anonymous. We need somewhere else to turn. While some students may well be expressing their concerns more privately, that so many concerns are voiced so often online reveals that our community is not open enough. Not all students feel free to have direct personal conversations; retreating into anonymity feels like the safer choice. But receiving words of encouragement or consolation in the comments section of a post is not sufficient to overcome one’s difficulties. The short term satisfaction of confessing on this page will not address deep rooted frustration. And while the pandemic has made human interaction difficult, this detachment between students began long before March moveout. Whether we are on campus or off, together or apart, we’re afraid to admit we’re not always happy.
The name of the page is likely a harmless joke, yet the language itself sadly but perfectly conveys a campus culture of self shaming. We need to stop seeing our insecurities or shortcomings as “confessions” and sinful secrets. Harvard Confessions isn’t the enemy, but we should be able to admit struggle to one another and ourselves because undoubtedly, every one of us has felt weak at some point. We need to cultivate a culture of acceptance in which we can be competitive and eager to succeed, but receptive to the reality that we might not. Rejection is not necessarily a fall from grace. It’s okay not to conform or be perfect or feel constant validation. It’s okay to be occasionally directionless or lonely. Shouting into the void is fine, but drifting serenely through it is fine, too. If we want to create a healthier campus, we need to stop typing and get talking, names and all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As U.S. hospitals braced for the onslaught of coronavirus cases this past spring, they radically restructured and reorganized to help ease the burden on staff and minimize transmission within the hospital. Along with ceasing elective surgeries and transforming floors to allow for care of intubated patients, visitors were forbidden from entering hospitals with few exceptions.
Now, several months removed from the peak of the pandemic here in Boston, a limited number of visitors are allowed at a time. As we reflect on our interventions and make plans for the next wave or the next epidemic, it is worth wondering: While limiting visitors allows some additional element of physical distancing, how much does a ban actually help our patients, and how much does it hurt them — especially mothers-to-be in the vulnerable perinatal period? Is it possible to limit visitor-spread virus while allowing our patients the dignity and the peace of companionship during one of the most stressful periods of their lives?
While the presence of a visitor may not be a strict medical necessity, a support person may be psychologically essential. Patients in the antepartum ward feel the visitor ban with particular salience: New mothers-to-be are facing the physical and emotional stressors of bringing a child into the world in a time of uncertainty and chaos, often on top of their own medical issues. The COVID-era visitor policies forced these women to confront pregnancy-associated complications on their own, isolated in a sterile hospital room, unable even to walk through the hospital, and interacting only with masked healthcare providers.
Initially, hospitals in New York City banned visitors even from the labor and delivery unit. But the presence of a support person during labor and delivery not only improves the experience of childbirth; it also correlates with concrete improvements in clinical outcomes. These labor and delivery policies were thus reversed relatively quickly, and they were never adopted in Boston. However, the remainder of the no-visitor policy did permeate other critical parts of Boston-area hospitals, including antepartum units.
A patient was one such first-time mom-to-be who endured the isolation brought by pregnancy complications in the era of COVID. Just after she reached 29 weeks, the patient’s water broke. In these cases of preterm premature rupture of the membranes, patients are admitted to the hospital’s antepartum unit given the risk of premature labor and life-threatening infection. But according to the strict visitor policy, as long as the patient was not in labor, she could not receive any visitors.
Fortunately, she made it to nearly 33 weeks before delivering her healthy baby boy. As soon as she went into labor, her partner was able to join her in the labor and delivery unit, hold her hand as she pushed, and cut the umbilical cord, welcoming their child into the world.
However, she had been hospitalized for nearly a month before the birth without any in-person support from her partner, family, or friends. Neither the support of hospital staff nor frequent FaceTimes with her loved ones could take the place of her partner or her mom being able to sit with her as the days turned into weeks, waiting for the baby to come. The patient will never get back those 25 days alone at the end of her pregnancy.
Although the patient has been doing well since the birth of her son, scenarios like hers may cause significant psychological pain, not only in the antepartum period but also in the already challenging postpartum period. Approximately one in eight women experience postpartum depression. While we have not experienced such widespread perinatal isolation prior to the COVID pandemic, studies have found that other types of traumatic birth experiences marked by pain and loss of control, such as emergency cesarean sections, predispose women to post-traumatic stress disorder and postpartum depression.
Thankfully, while the visitor ban was an early policy during the pandemic surge, multiple infection control interventions for hospital staff have successfully been implemented in the hospital such as universal masking, hand hygiene, and daily symptom attestation so that a limited number of visitors may now safely return. In future pandemic surges, hospitals should also consider additional safety measures short of banning visitors — such as limiting the number of support people per patient per day and staggering arrival and departure times with staff shift changes to facilitate physical distancing in entrances, hallways, and elevators. As coronavirus testing ramps up, visitors could undergo viral testing prior to arrival, just as admitted patients are now universally tested in many healthcare settings.
If we fail to maintain visitor accommodations, our patients will likely suffer. Not only will some patients suffer the psychological consequences of isolation; others may avoid coming into the hospital entirely. Patients have appeared to avoid the hospital even in emergencies during the COVID pandemic, likely out of fear of coronavirus — perhaps compounded by fear of isolation. In the case of pregnant patients, anecdotally, demand for out-of-hospital births rose during the COVID-19 pandemic; according to the New York Homebirth Collective, pregnant patients may be resorting to home births without proper screening and preparation.
In medicine, we are sworn into a practice that prioritizes, above all else, doing no harm. In medical ethics, this is elaborated in the principles of beneficence — doing good for all patients, with consideration for those patients’ circumstances and medical issues — and non-maleficence – minimizing harm to our patients and our society in any way possible. A pandemic puts the benefit of infectious disease risk reduction at odds with the benefit of social support and puts the potential harm of exposure at odds with the harm of isolation. While initial pandemic policies rightly emphasized infectious disease precautions, we now know enough both about infection control and about deleterious effects of isolation to inform our future healthcare policies.
As we continue to move through the phased reopening of hospitals and society more broadly, and as we simultaneously prepare for a potential second wave of coronavirus this fall, we must take this time to reflect on our hospital policies. We must map out clear visitor rules that limit spread of the virus as much as possible without isolating our patients.

When I was 12 years old, I created a rule to preserve my sanity: I don’t watch videos of Black people dying.
I came to this decision at breakfast in the lobby of a LaQuinta Inn in New Mexico. There was a TV in the corner blasting Fox News coverage of the police shooting of Michael Brown. They kept on showing the same reel of his body just lying in the middle of the street, blocked off by police tape.
I remember mindlessly stuffing pieces of syrup-soaked waffle into my mouth, staring at the dark outline of his back on the pavement, and trying to figure out why I felt like I was suffocating. I’ve avoided videos like it for the rest of my life. It’s not like I’m missing anything; they’re all different, but they’re all the same.
On May 26, there were two videos going viral on Twitter. The first was the murder of George Floyd, which I didn’t watch. The second depicted an encounter in Central Park, which I did watch, mostly by accident, because a friend texted it to me with the addendum: Why is this lady literally choking her dog? I opened it.
“I’m taking a picture and calling the cops!” a white woman, Amy Cooper, yells, voice slightly muffled by her mask.
A disembodied voice responds. “Please call the cops.”
“I’m going to tell them that there’s an African American man threatening my life.”
“Please tell them whatever you’d like.”
At this point I almost close it, disgusted, but I stop myself. Amy Cooper moves backwards a few steps, pulls down her mask, and puts her phone to her ear. She speaks rapidly. “I’m in the Ramble and there’s a man, African American, he has a bicycle helmet, he’s recording me and threatening me and my dog.”
Beside her, true to my friend’s description, her dog, which she’s holding by the collar, does indeed appear to be choking. It makes a loud gagging noise and she finally sets it down. Her voice rises in intensity. “There is an African American man recording me in Central Park. He is threatening myself and my dog. I am being threatened by a man in the Ramble! Please send the cops immediately! I’m in Central Park in the Ramble, I don’t know!”
“Thank you,” Christian F. Cooper ’84 says, calm, with only the slightest hint of irritation. The video ends. God, what a horrible woman, I remember thinking. And then I realized, from my reaction alone, that this particular video would be received very differently from the others. The black man didn’t die, and the white woman who called the police on him was obviously not the victim.
The encounter in the Ramble, a dense woodland area in New York City’s Central Park, changed the trajectory of both Amy and Christian Cooper’s lives. By the time the police arrived, the pair had left the park. By lunch that day, Christian Cooper had posted the video on Facebook and his sister, Melody, had reposted it to Twitter. From there it began to spread, racking up tens of millions of views and garnering attention from major news outlets.
It’s perfect outrage-bait: Years after the advent of the Black Lives Matter movement, a white woman weaponizes race on camera to sic the police on a Black man. A trick that might ordinarily work in Amy Cooper’s favor doesn’t, probably because it was recorded. She has been embedded in the national consciousness as a villain.
Meanwhile, miraculous details of Christian Cooper’s life circulate social media: He is a Harvard alumnus, an avid birder, a board member of the New York Audubon Society, a former editor and writer at Marvel Comics. He walks around Central Park in hiking boots, Star-Trek t-shirts, a bandana, and what he describes as “little round nerdy eyeglasses,” clutching a pair of binoculars. He gives dozens of media interviews in the wake of the encounter and answers questions flawlessly. Inevitably, pundits highlight his demeanor in the moment, how calm he remained while facing Amy Cooper. Articles written about him list his accolades — “Christian Cooper, a 57-year-old, Harvard-educated science editor,” — as if they were a distillation of his essence.
On July 7, Christian Cooper told the New York Times that he would not assist in Amy Cooper’s prosecution. “Bringing her more misery just seems like piling on,” he said at the time.
When I first spoke with Cooper over an hour-long Zoom call from my kitchen, I was really trying to understand this choice.
Eventually, I came to the following conclusions: It’s not that he thinks that Amy Cooper shouldn’t be punished — he does. He’s not an abolitionist. And he’s certainly not interested in reconciling with her.
But his decision not to assist the prosecutor in pressing charges complicates the binary of villain and victim to which the United States has clung amid this “racial reckoning.” To single her out specifically for more punishment, to make it seem like her behavior was particularly anomalous, misses a deeper point about the terror that police inflict on Black Americans. According to his July op-ed in The Washington Post, it “lets white America off the hook.”
Christian Cooper, who has been intimately involved with movements for social justice his entire life, who has lived 57 years as a Black man in America, has always understood that a Harvard degree and a penchant for birdwatching can’t always protect him. In fact, he would probably view that observation as rather mundane. He would much rather focus on creating a system where he doesn’t need protection in the first place.
Christian Cooper’s father had a saying: “I’m not gonna let anybody tell me where I can or can’t go.”
Both Cooper’s mother and father were teachers. Every summer, they’d set out on long road trips around the U.S. and Canada, piling into their Volkswagen Westphalia Camper with their family dog, an English cocker spaniel. They knew that a Black family wouldn’t be welcome everywhere they went.
On one of these trips, somewhere in the middle of the country, the family stopped for food at a diner. They walked in, sat at the counter, and waited. And waited.
A white couple walked in past the Coopers and was served immediately. The Coopers sat and watched, humiliated.
“My dad was livid,” recalls Melody Cooper, Christian’s younger sister. “He’s like, ‘Excuse me, we were here before they were and you haven’t taken our order yet.’ And the waitress was like, ‘Well, you’ll just have to wait.’”
Then, a surprising turn: The white couple refused to pay until the Coopers had been served. The waitress wouldn’t budge, and both the Coopers and the white couple walked out.
That experience wasn’t out of the ordinary for the Coopers. They lived in the newly-integrated town of Uniondale, near Long Island’s lily-white planned communities. Christian and his sister were schooled very early in activist movements; his parents were active in their area chapter of the Coalition for Racial Equality.
One winter, Long Island received a particularly harsh snowstorm, piling several feet of snow on the ground. The city refused to plow the Black section of town. Furious, Cooper’s father organized a group to block traffic on Jerusalem Avenue, the town’s color line, until snowplows came into their neighborhood.
Throughout Christian and Melody’s childhoods, their parents took them to protests in Jersey City over racial injustice. “There’s pictures of them on post-civil rights protest marches with me in a stroller and my sister toddling along,” Christian? Cooper says, smiling. “It just sort of formed this ethic that if you see something wrong in the world, it’s your personal responsibility to do something to fix it. So you don’t get to throw up your hands and say, ‘Oh, isn’t this terrible.’ You have to take action.”
The Coopers also grew up with a deep connection to the natural world — Cooper’s father was a biology teacher. At ten years old, his parents made him enroll in a woodworking class where he built a bird feeder; ever since, he’s been hooked.
He doesn’t even have to see a bird to identify it. For Cooper, to be outside is to be automatically attuned to the birdsong around him. He has trained himself to filter out other sounds to focus specifically on bird calls, learning the differences in their cadences and pitches, the patterns in how they communicate with each other. He identifies birds without consciously knowing he’s doing it.
“It’s like a sixth sense, almost,” he said in an interview with PBS’s NOVA. In that same interview, the hosts play him a series of bird calls to test his skills. He gets every single one right. “There’s a myth that I have the best ears in the park,” he told the New York Times. “It’s a myth.”
Cooper seems like he’s most comfortable when he’s talking about birds — his face lights up as he makes a gesture or mimics a sound. “They just capture the imagination in a way that few other creatures can, principally because they can fly. I mean, that absolute freedom, that ability to go up to a place that is normally beyond reach,” he says. “They have a whole new axis of physical perception of dimension of movement. How amazing is that if your brain worked in that way?”
Then, he grins. “They're also cool because they’re dinosaurs,” he adds.
He’s protective of the Ramble, and other places where birds live and breed. “I just have no patience for people who have no regard for the other living things that we share the planet with,” he says.
It was that principle that brought him into conflict with Amy Cooper in Central Park. She had left her dog unleashed in the underbrush of the Ramble, potentially disturbing nesting habitats for birds. Aware that this was a common problem, Cooper and other birders had started recording people who violated the leashing policy to encourage the city to enforce it.
“That’s not an option in my family — just sit there and do nothing,” Cooper says. “You’ve gotta do something to fix it.”
Christian Cooper says that the primary reason why he decided to go to Harvard was because, “I’m fucking smart.”
But I wonder if there were any other factors in his decision. Like Cooper, I grew up in a segregated suburb of New York, which at times has given me an unhealthy preoccupation with what white people think of me. I knew that I had to subvert their expectations before they projected them onto me; going to Harvard, I intuited, would be helpful to this goal.
Sometimes, I thought I saw that line of thought in Cooper. “There’s a reason why I never wear contact lenses,” he told Gayle King in an interview with CBS. “Because people react differently to Black men who wear little round nerdy eyeglasses and to one who doesn’t.”
So I ask him about it. He acknowledges that he probably felt something similar, albeit subconsciously. “[Harvard] is what makes us safe. It’s a guarantee of our non-menacing-ness. Because all Black men are menacing unless we have little round glasses or we have Harvard degrees, right?” he says sarcastically.
Not that this always works, at least upon first encounter. “People will ask, ‘Where did you go to school?’ And I’ll say ‘Harvard’ and they’ll look at me and say, ‘Howard?’ And I’m like, ‘no’.”
Cooper arrived at Harvard thinking that he’d study Government and become a lawyer, influenced by the activists in his family. He quickly changed his mind about law, but he stuck with Government, even though he never felt that it really called to him. “I was just getting through college,” he says. “I didn’t even write a thesis.”
“It was his routine to do whatever work had to be done in the eight hours before it was due,” says one of his then-roommates and close friends, Mike M. Phillips ’84. “I don’t know how he did that. That would have made me insane. But he always did that. And I assume to this very day does that.”
His favorite classes were in ornithology and English. He has particularly fond memories of a class he took in modern literature. “I’ve always had this storytelling urge and so it was intriguing to see what other people had done with that urge,” he says. “Plus, the professor was hot.” The professor, it should be noted, was a man.
Throughout his first semester at Harvard, Cooper had been keeping a secret: He was gay. But by his first reading period at Harvard, he had reached a breaking point. It was January, and Cambridge was bitterly cold. The sun rose late and set early. “I always go into a mini-depression in January or February,” he says.
He had known that he was gay for a while before then, but in the seventies, “it was death to be out in high school,” he recalls, so he initially kept it to himself. When he saw the Gay Students Association listed as a club in a Harvard admissions packet, he was hopeful that that might change. “I clung to this idea that when I got to Harvard I would be free!” he says.
That didn’t happen right away, though. He very quickly became close with his suitemates in Hurlbut. But initially, he wasn’t sure if he could come out to them.
“I was an idiot,” Phillips says. “We were so stupid. I remember we were at the student union, and we went by the gay students table, and I said something like, ‘Gosh I’m glad you’re not sitting there, Chris.’”
Phillips seems to wince through the phone as he tells me this. “I’m sure it was a hard thing for him to hear me say,” he continues. “If I could rewrite the script, I would not say that.” Cooper himself never brings up this particular anecdote, which Phillips says, “is an act of kindness.”
“Finally, reading period came and I was like, I can’t take it anymore,” Cooper says. Over the course of a single night he came out to all of them.
“The shock of that lasted about four seconds and then we’re like, ‘Oh, okay.’ And that was pretty much it,” Phillips recalls. “And then, you know, Chris took us to a gay dance club or something.” he adds. “We were just a really compatible group through all four years of college and Chris was the heart and soul of that.”
This month, Cooper published a comic with DC called “It’s a Bird,” about a Black teenage birdwatcher named Jules who is given a pair of magical binoculars. When Jules points the binoculars at a bird, he sees not just the bird, but also dead victims of police violence. It’s supposed to be a reminder of the stakes of the fight for racial justice — if we don’t change, more people will die.
Growing up, Cooper loved comics. Throughout college he frequently visited a comic store called The Million Year Picnic, which still stands in the Square today. “I discovered all sorts of wonderful, fantastic, crazy, nutso worlds and stories in that wonderful little place,” he says.
His sister says Cooper has always used comics to express his vision of justice. “He saw that the whole idea of being able to fight the bully, fight the wrong, was not just in something that my parents taught us,” she says.
Right out of college, Cooper became an assistant editor at Marvel Comics, which he says was “the one time it might have almost hurt” to have a Harvard degree. “They looked at my resume and they said, ‘You’re way overqualified for this job.’ I said, ‘I don’t care! I will Xerox ‘til my fingers are bloody! I just want to be in the place.’ Fortunately, they looked past Harvard on my resume.”
While working at Marvel, Cooper edited Alpha Flight, a series about a group of Canadian superheroes. There, he helped introduce Marvel’s first openly gay superhero, Northstar.
“It’s funny because I had read Alpha Flight from its first issue at Harvard in freshman year,” he says. “And [there’s] nothing explicit but by the end of the first issue I was like, ‘Northstar is gay.’”
So when a new writer for the series suggested that Northstar should come out, Cooper and another editor thought, “Oh, that’s a good idea.”
They had no idea that they’d started a controversy. “Marvel completely shut us down,” Cooper says. “They couldn’t stop the issue coming up, but they wouldn’t let us talk about it.” Cooper began to receive hate-mail from readers, including from a comic book store owner in Texas who complained that he’d now be forced to put Alpha Flight in the adult section and wrap the cover in paper. “I’m like, ‘Really? It’s not Playboy; it’s Alpha Flight.’”
In 2012, two decades after Cooper helped establish him as a gay character, Northstar was given the first same-sex wedding in Marvel history, in the series “Astonishing X-Men.” In contrast to 1992, the issue was not played down by executives; in fact, the event was depicted on the front of the comic. “Times change,” Cooper says wryly.
In 1999, Christian Cooper spent a night in The Tombs.
The Tombs is a nickname for the Manhattan Detention Complex, an imposing 15-story brutalist structure with slits for windows near Chinatown. It’s a jail that usually holds men who can’t make bail, and has a long history of violence and corruption. Cooper remembers being put with several other men in a small room with a toilet in the corner. “They wake you up at 3 a.m. to throw you Wonder Bread with a slice of baloney between it to feed you,” he says. “It’s just a vile experience.”
Cooper had been protesting the killing of Amadou Diallo, a Ghanian immigrant who was shot by the New York Police Department 41 times on his own doorstep. New York was consumed with protests — “Black Lives Matter before they called it Black Lives Matter,” Cooper says. Thousands took to the streets. “Some cop came up and smacked the sign out of my hand and grabbed me and carted me off,” Cooper says. “And that’s the one where I ended up in The Tombs.”
This was actually the third time something similar had happened to him. “There’s a family joke that you’re not a Cooper unless you’ve been arrested at a protest,” he once said in an interview with CBS.
The second time was also at an Amadou Diallo protest a few weeks earlier. For two weeks in March of that year, thousands of protestors sat in front of police headquarters carrying signs reading, “I'm Afraid of the NYPD” and, “Adolf Giuliani” (a reference to the harsh law-and-order tactics of then-mayor Rudi Giuliani). Eventually, more than 1,200 people were arrested, including Cooper and his father. “That was actually actually a very bonding experience, to be arrested with my dad,” he says.
The first time was at a protest against anti-gay violence. Around the same time Cooper was at Marvel he was also active in the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), which was formed at the height of the AIDS epidemic to counter homophobic media narratives. GLAAD frequently protested outlets like the New York Post and persuaded the New York Times to use the term “gay” instead of “homosexual.” Eventually, Cooper became co-chair of GLAAD’s board of directors.
Cooper is a believer in street activism and protests, though in recent years his work has mostly been concerned with the “less sexy” aspect of enacting change — what he calls “political maneuvering.” When the New York State Senate was still held by Republicans, he created a political action committee (PAC) called “No More R.E.P.T.Y.L.s.” R.E.P.T.Y.L.s — pronounced “reptiles” — stands for, “Republicans toying with your life.”
The PAC was meant to support challengers of Republican incumbents with the goal of flipping the State Senate. This was particularly important to LGBTQ+ New Yorkers; the state had yet to pass anti-discrimination protections or legalize gay marriage, despite the fact that states around them had. “No More R.E.P.T.Y.L.s” itself wasn’t particularly long-lived — “I was never very good at fundraising”, Cooper says — and later became an email list which he used to solicit donations for important races in New York.
In 2012, Democrats won a numerical majority in the New York Senate — though they wouldn’t gain an actual majority until 2018 — a moment that fills Cooper with pride.
I’m sure my jaw was hanging open as he told me all of this. In all my research, this part of his background never came up; the media sometimes vaguely referred to him as a “community activist” or brought up his parents’ activism — but never mentioned his own. The fact that he’s been doing this kind of work for years, long before Amy Cooper, strikes me as important: it makes his media appearances, and his decision not to prosecute, seem a little more deliberate. He knew change wouldn’t come by focusing on her, but by focusing on the system.
Throughout our conversation, there’s only one thing I find genuinely difficult to understand about Christian Cooper. He wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post explaining that he declined to assist in the prosecution of Amy Cooper because he “suffered no harm, physical or mental,” from her actions.
The first clause of this statement is obvious, since he never interacted with the police. The second is a little harder to comprehend. How is it possible to leave an encounter that could have resulted in your murder and be mentally fine?
To this day, his sister is haunted by what could have gone wrong. “The thing that I saw [in the video] was him being held out on the ground,” she says. “And he was going to be choked.”
Christian Cooper is aware of this. But after 57 years of life where “you have the taxicab go by without stopping, you get followed through the store because you’re a Black person, all those indignities big and small, that toughens up your skin.”
This, I think, is one of the most depressing things I’ve ever heard. Not that I don’t get the sentiment. When the nation was consumed with protests in June, I started getting text messages from white people that basically boiled down to, are you okay? My initial reaction was always, why wouldn’t I be? If I went to pieces every time a Black person was murdered, I’d never be able to get out of bed. So, yes, I’m okay. Maybe that speaks to something deeper in me that is not actually okay.
Immediately after his encounter with Amy Cooper, Christian Cooper went to a place he knew would ground him: to the park, to go birding and reset. “I was like, I’m just not going to give this woman the power to wreck my psyche. You’re just not that important,” he says. “You don’t have the agency to comb my soul like that. I’m done with you.”
I have no idea how he manages to react this way. I ask him if this was some deliberate philosophy of forgiveness, perhaps trying to find something that I could absorb myself. Nope. “It wasn’t about ‘Oh, I’m gonna set myself free by forgiving her,’” he says. “I didn’t feel captive.”
Of course, not everybody agreed with his decision. On Twitter, and among many in the Black community, there was blowback. “This ain’t about you anymore Christian. You have to do this for the next Black person because the next one won’t be as lucky if they run into another Amy Cooper who will succeed. Stop this nonsense of forgiveness.” read one viral Tweet. Cooper doesn’t usually look at social media, but allows that “the pieces of it I saw were painful. I felt like, in some respects, I let a lot of people down.”
But he still can’t villainize Amy Cooper. “I approach it the way I do it because I was there. And yeah, she’s a deeply flawed human being who did a shitty racist thing, and may still be doing shitty racist things.” he says. “But still, I can’t help but see her as a human being because I was there.”
He and his sister, who agree on almost everything else about the Black Lives Matter movement, diverge slightly here. “He looks at it from a very personal perspective. You know, he went out birding and he was fine,” Melody Cooper says. “I said, ‘Chris, the police wouldn’t have known you went to Harvard; if they had shown up, you wouldn’t have been able to pull out your resume and show it to them.’”
Harvard is important to this, though, if only in the aftermath. The media framing of the facts of his life seems to be something like, how could you call the police on someone like that? Of course, this treatment itself raises some questions, namely around whether it implies that Amy Cooper would’ve been justified had he fit more easily into stereotypes around Black men.
Usually, victims of racism and police brutality are portrayed in the inverse manner — someone always takes pains to emphasize that, “they were no angel.” It happened to George Floyd, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, and countless others. It didn’t matter if friends described them as a “gentle giant,” or if they were about to go to college, or if their children relied on them; there was always some element of character assassination.
Maybe some of the anger directed towards him comes from frustration over this media narrative. Why does a Black man have to have a Harvard degree to be treated like a human? As his sister wrote in the New York Times, he has been perceived as a “Good Negro” — the kind of Black person who allows “white people to feel comfortable.” The kind of Black person whose forgiveness shows that he’s not a threat.
His pronouncement that he wouldn’t cooperate with the prosecution was greeted by the rest of America with headlines praising his “justice and mercy,” and approving op-eds from outlets like the New York Post (which itself has a troubling history with racist coverage). His extension of empathy to a white woman whose actions could have killed him seems to have cemented his goodness in the minds of many white onlookers..
Cooper thinks that a lot of these takes miss the point. “I’m a little bit like, great, white people love me.” He says sarcastically. “It’s like, I’m not doing this for you. Whatever I do, it’s because I want to move this conversation forward, and it’s for all of us, but in particular for Black people.”
But he also understands where his critics are coming from. “There’s a principle to be upheld here,” he says. But ultimately, he thinks that she’s already received a punishment proportionate to the harm she committed.
More than anything, though, he would rather not focus on Amy Cooper because he doesn’t think it’s about her. As he wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, “Focusing on charging Amy Cooper lets white people off the hook… they can scream for her head while leaving their own prejudices unexamined.” To place all the attention on Amy Cooper, to paint her as a complete villain, would make her seem like an anomaly. And as Christian Cooper knows all too well, she’s not out of the ordinary at all.
Cooper suggests instead that we direct our energies toward changing the system itself. This is where he and his sister are in complete agreement. He seems leery of some of the more radical proposals coming out of this moment, though he allows that the idea of defunding the police — redirecting funds from policing to social services to get at the underlying sources of crime — “has a lot of merit.” Police officers, he points out, are expected to perform a variety of duties that might be better addressed by trained professionals. “Defund the police is a stupid slogan, though,” he qualifies. “Turns so many people off and is easily caricatured.”
A few weeks after the incident with Amy Cooper, Christian Cooper took Good Morning America with him birding in the Ramble. In July, Central Park becomes intensely green; yellow rays of morning light filter through the trees. It’s early, just after dawn, and there are few people around. His conversation is wide ranging, from Amy Cooper to Marvel, punctuated by bird sightings — “There’s a flicker here! Great crested flycatchers!” When he at last catches a glimpse of a bird he hasn’t seen in a while, his face splits open into a grin.
This scene is perhaps reminiscent of another, several years earlier. This one took place in the winter, in the wake of Cooper’s divorce, at the Franklin Mountain Hawkwatch in Oneonta, a town in upstate New York ringed by gentle peaks. It’s one of the few places in the Northeast where golden eagles are frequently sighted. Cooper doesn’t drive, so he reserved a bus ticket and a hotel to stay in overnight. “I just thought, you know what? I’m free and I can do whatever I want. I don’t have to justify it to anybody and goddamnit I’m gonna go up to Oneonta because I’ve always wanted to do that.”
He left his hotel in a taxi before dawn, cold wind whipping his face as he stood and waited at the top of Franklin Mountain, the town spread out underneath him. And then they appeared; dozens of golden eagles, coasting in on the incoming cold front, free to roam the skies as they pleased. And that made the trip worth it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weeks into the fall semester at Harvard, businesses in Harvard Square are grappling with a significantly smaller customer base.
The start of the school year typically marks the influx of thousands of students into Harvard Square, but this year the University is welcoming just roughly 25 percent of undergraduates back to campus.
Adam DiCenso, the owner of Pinocchio’s Pizza, said the fall typically brings a surge in customers to his restaurant.
“Years past, under sort of, quote unquote, normal circumstances, we would go from July being relatively quiet and then September, when all the undergrads would come,” he said. “We would get absolutely steamrolled with business.”
“That didn’t happen this year,” he added.
Duncan Browne, director of field operations and business administration for Newbury Comics, also said the start of the fall semester is usually a very busy time.
“Late August and September, historically, for us, has always been a good time of year from a business standpoint,” he said.
Many Harvard Square businesses have had to alter their operations to accommodate not only health and safety guidelines from the pandemic, but also a changing customer base.
Adele N. Traub, marketing manager for J.P. Licks, said the store’s usual late-night hours are no longer necessary with so few students in Harvard Square.
“So many people would come over [for] like late-night, kind of, rewards after classes, like ‘Oh I finished my paper, I’m coming in for ice cream,’ or like, ‘We need coffee, we have another paper to write,’” she said. “We cut back our hours because that just wasn’t happening.”
Harvard administrators allowed freshmen and a select number of upperclassmen to live on campus for the fall semester. Roughly 1,600 students are living in residence this semester, per an August email from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the students who are visiting Square businesses are frequenting a smaller number of restaurants and favoring businesses that offer affordable food and drink options.
“In terms of business, for the most part, it’s the younger student body, so they’re not in the Square at night, having dinner or a cocktail or a glass of wine,” she said. “The kinds of businesses that they tend to go to are the ones on the lower end of the scale in terms of price point.”
Alex W. Meriwether, general manager of the Harvard Book Store, said their operations have also been affected by slower business and guidelines related to the pandemic.
“At the end of August we switched over to being open on Sundays but closed on Mondays,” Meriwether said. “We have curbside pickup hours every day for those who have online orders.”
“This is still very limited from what we are used to,” he added. “It just takes a lot more staff to get the same amount of work done.”
Traub said the cancellation of many traditional Harvard Square events that attract students will also affect business.
“We aren’t gonna see the pick-up from the Head of the Charles, which is always such an exciting weekend, and usually there’s all those fairs that happen in the Square,” she said. “It’s definitely different.”
Many representatives from Harvard Square businesses said even though business is slower than usual this fall, it has still improved since the pandemic shut down stores and restaurants in March.
DiCenso said he saw that improvement at Pinocchio’s in the late summer.
“It definitely was a very long, quiet spring slash summer around here,” DiCenso said. “As the restrictions were slowly being lifted from across the state, as we got into late July and sort of in August, things actually kind of picked up a little bit.”
“It actually was a little better, but, obviously, we definitely needed and were awaiting the arrival of the students,” he added.
Traub also said Harvard Square is much livelier now than it was immediately after students were forced to vacate their dorms in March.
“It got very quiet so fast in the spring because so much of our business is students,” Traub said. “It felt post-apocalyptic in the Square because there was no one there.”
In addition to the limited number of students living on campus, several students have opted to live off-campus in the Cambridge and Boston area for the fall semester. Still, some off-campus students say they have not frequented Square businesses very often.
Ali Jebari ’22, who is renting an apartment in Somerville for the fall semester with friends, said he has not ventured into Harvard Square as much as he would have during a typical school year living in Adams House.
“I’ve been to El Jefe’s, for example,” he said. “But I don’t go there as often or I don’t spend as much money as I used to on Harvard Square businesses, for sure.”
“When it comes to where we’ve been spending our money, I think it’s mostly been local, so like in the Somerville area where we moved to, because it’s more convenient,” Jebari added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Citing “recent cases among student athletes,” Harvard University Health Services emailed a group of students living off campus Thursday to ask them to report for University-run testing tomorrow.
Senior Director of Nursing and Health Promotion Maria M. Francesconi wrote in the email that Harvard “is continuing to monitor positive COVID cases among our students, including some recent cases among student athletes, like yourself.”
She sent the email to at least one member of the crew, sailing, and football teams, though it remains unclear whether Harvard also asked student athletes on other teams to report for testing.
Despite the email, the number of coronavirus cases Harvard has reported remains low. No undergraduates have tested positive within the past week, and only nine have tested positive since June 1.
Harvard’s testing and tracing website only outlines regular testing procedures for students who either live or are authorized to work on campus — not students who, like those that received the email, are enrolled but live in off-campus housing. The University also occasionally tests affiliates who fall outside these categories if they are identified through contact tracing efforts.
“I am writing to ask if you would come for covid testing tomorrow, Friday, September 25th in the Science Center Plaza tent,” Francesconi wrote. “This testing is very important for us in our ongoing efforts to monitor the virus on our campus and quickly contain any further potential illness among our students.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the emails are an outgrowth of Harvard’s contact tracing efforts, which extend beyond just student athletes.
“In some instances, based [on] contact tracing activities, the University may screen members of the Harvard community who are not currently authorized to be on campus, but who may have been exposed to another Harvard community member known to have tested positive for the virus. Off campus screening may be extended to more individuals for the sake of completeness in the University's monitoring efforts,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Cambridge moves into the fall and winter seasons, supporting local businesses, expanding affordable housing, and confronting racism and police violence remain top of mind for city leaders, two members of the Cambridge City Council say.
From the economic fallout due to COVID-19 to housing and policing issues, city councilors say they have adjusted their typical list of top concerns in light of new issues presented by the coronavirus pandemic.
“The biggest concerns all relate to COVID in some way,” Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler said in an interview Wednesday.
Beyond the public health emergency, Councillor Quinton Zondervan has also sought to emphasize public safety.
“Of course we’re now working on COVID-19 and the economic impacts and how do we get out of that. Then we’ve been dealing with the racism and police violence issues as well and thinking through all of that. How do we reimagine public safety in Cambridge?” he said in a Tuesday interview.
Preventing the spread of the virus while keeping local businesses afloat has remained a priority for the council.
“We’ve been able to contain the outbreak, for the most part,” Zondervan said. “We’ve come up with some innovative ways for some of the businesses to continue operating – outdoor dining for restaurants and things like that. We’re extending those now into the winter.”
In addition, the city has provided funding to assist small businesses and nonprofits. It also supported the development of Starlight Square, according to Zondervan. The Central Square Business Improvement District created the space as a “placekeeping initiative” that temporarily converted a municipal parking lot into an outdoor community center, dining courtyard, and amphitheater.
City officials have also debated reopening schools in recent months. Cambridge public schools started the school year remotely, but in-person learning for eligible students will begin in mid-October.
“There’s been a bunch of discussion about school reopenings both with the council and especially with the School Committee. Plans are safe at this point. We’ll watch and see how it goes,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
Beyond questions of reopening and remote learning, Zondervan added that the city has grappled with how to help schools connect students of color to minority teachers.
“We have an extended day program in the elementary school that my kids attended that was very helpful for their education, as students of color, to have access to teachers and mentors,” Zondervan said. “That program is not part of the school department — it’s part of the city budget.”
Fundraising is critical for such programs, according to Zondervan. The overall program received a budget of $1 million dollars when $4 million was requested, he noted.
Zondervan said he believes the amount of money allocated annually to police departments should go to programs like this one instead.
“Why are we spending millions of dollars on policing, when we could and should be spending money on educating our students and mentoring them and supporting them, helping them be successful?” Zondervan asked.
Back in July, the City Council passed a policy order, sponsored by Sobrinho-Wheeler and Zondervan, that asked the City Manager to look into the creation of a non-police emergency response personnel. These unarmed employees, instead of the police, would manage traffic enforcement.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said the city will also begin examining different models for a “non-police emergency response.”
Ensuring affordable housing has remained a priority for councilors. The Affordable Housing Overlay proposal from the last council term was reintroduced in February, with the goal of lowering the cost of constructing affordable housing developments throughout the city.
Still, Zondervan said thousands of people are on the waiting list for affordable housing due to the limited number of units built in Cambridge every year. In order to close this gap, he suggested increasing investments into reasonably priced housing.
“What it would ultimately come down to is funding. We have to invest more money to make 100 percent affordable housing because the market is not going to solve this problem,” Zondervan said.
The statewide eviction moratorium, set to continue until mid-October, has also helped with housing worries during the pandemic.
“I think all of us want to make sure that folks who have lost jobs or lost income can continue to afford to pay rent, both because housing stability is incredibly important, and because without housing it’s hard to socially distance to stop the spread of the virus,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
While the councilors’ priorities have shifted due to COVID-19, Sobrinho-Wheeler and Zondervan said their desire to serve constituents has remained constant.
“It’s sort of a different context with coronavirus than I think any of us expected the term to be like, but the same issues are there, and I’m glad to have the opportunity to serve,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
The seven other members of the City Council did not respond to The Crimson’s interview requests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it begins its first semester as a fully operational local, Harvard’s graduate student union is alleging that the University is attempting to defund the union and impede its organizing by not deducting union dues for student workers, union president Brandon J. Mancilla said.
As with most unions, students who join Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers are asked to pay union dues. These payments support the union’s fiscal continuity and cover any costs associated with its major organizing activities, such as bargaining and settling grievances.
HGSU-UAW members have their union fees automatically deducted from their paychecks and transferred to the union at a rate of 1.44 percent of gross income, per the final contract the union and Harvard reached earlier this year. When students sign membership cards to join the union, Harvard is supposed to automatically enroll them into a dues deduction system in its payroll.
But Mancilla said the University did not deduct dues from members’ paychecks until September 18, nearly three months after the contract’s July 1 ratification, and alleged this was a deliberate attempt by Harvard to challenge the union.
“This is a test year for [the University] to see how much they can handle us existing and being formalized,” Mancilla said. “From July 1 to September 18, if you signed a membership card, authorizing the automatic deduction of dues, Harvard had not done so.”
Beyond just withholding dues, Mancilla alleged that the administration did not communicate appropriate information to the unions about which members had voluntarily agreed to deduct dues from their paychecks.
“We see that as an attempt on their part to defund us — to not allow us to have the resources to be able to organize, to be able to build our campaign for a second contract, to not be able to reach our membership and other workers who are not yet members effectively, and, yes, starve out our resources during this test year,” Mancilla said.
HGSU-UAW has filed a formal grievance over the complaints, Mancilla said, and is currently working towards a resolution with the administration.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the allegations.
“The University will not comment on the status or substance of a pending grievance filed by HGSU-UAW or other union,” he wrote in an email.
The graduate student union operates under an “open shop” clause, which does not require student workers to join the union or pay dues just because they are eligible for inclusion in its bargaining unit. This contract provision is unique to HGSU-UAW and does not apply to Harvard’s other unions.
This “right-to-work” open shop provision drew strong criticism from organizers when Harvard initially proposed it in February 2019, with members saying it would prevent the union from gaining enough financial resources to organize and continue its activities.
Mancilla said resolving that standing disagreement will form an essential part of negotiations when the two sides meet at the bargaining table again next spring.

The City of Cambridge announced Monday that it will extend its partnership program with local restaurants to provide meals to homeless residents until December 31.
The program began in March when the city contracted 15 restaurants to prepare boxed and bagged meals in response to staff shortages and reduced service capacity at shelters and meal providers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
As of September 21, the city has spent nearly $500,000 contracting 50 restaurants to provide more than 2,800 meals per week, amounting to more than 70,000 meals since the program’s inception.
“As we move into the colder months of the year, and with the giving season upon us, the simple act of providing a warm meal for our unhoused residents perfectly illustrates the way the Cambridge community shows up for each other in a time of need,” Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in a press release.
The Central Square Business Improvement District and the Harvard Square Business Association have worked with the city to identify restaurants in their district that can participate in the initiative. The city is inviting additional interested restaurants to contact its Purchasing Department.
Tthe partnership has also helped local businesses involved in preparing meals financially.
“Since March, our small businesses have been hurting. The homeless shelters meals program has been a lifeline to our local restaurants and an opportunity for them to help some of our most vulnerable here in Central Square,” said Michael Monestime, Executive Director of the Central Square BID, in a press release.
The meals are delivered to 16 shelters and meal programs that the city’s Department of Human Service Programs considers as having a “strong need” for meals.
The same operational challenges that many Cambridge homeless shelters faced in March will continue through this fall and winter. Harvard Square Homeless Shelter will remain closed indefinitely, while other shelters, like Y2Y, are able to house fewer people than they used to. Advocates have expressed concern that the city’s current housing measures, including the temporary shelter at the War Memorial Recreation Center, will not be enough to house all of Cambridge’s homeless population from the cold. Some are already providing sleeping bags to the homeless in anticipation.
Young Bae Kim, a volunteer for Loaves and Fishes — one of the recipients of the city’s meal program — said in the press release that the extension will allow the nonprofit to provide meals through the end of the year.
With this knowledge, Kim said, the organization will also be able to “continue other vital programs such as our holiday winter care package — a program where we provide a gift bag of hats, gloves, and other items to keep you warm.”

An international team of scientists have developed the first large-scale, single-cell map of the healthy human heart, a major milestone to understanding how the organ performs its vital functions and how cardiovascular diseases manifest in the heart.
The study — published in Nature, a top peer-reviewed publication, Thursday — was co-led by Harvard Medical School professors Christine E. Seidman ’74 and Jonathan G. Seidman ’71, along with collaborators at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in Germany, and Imperial College London.
Daniel Reichart, a genetics research fellow at the Medical School and co-first author of the study, said the team used single-nuclei RNA sequencing to study around 500,000 individual cells from the healthy hearts of 14 organ donors whose hearts were unsuitable for transplantation due to reasons unrelated to health status.
“We measured the RNA content and were then able to track back what kind of cell type it is, and what kind of function it might have, how they are closely related, and how they are interacting with each other,” Reichart said.
Christine Seidman said this technique was crucial to their study, as traditional methods for examining bulk tissue do not allow researchers to understand the molecular and cellular details of individual cells in the heart.
“Instead of eating pieces of fruit, you have a smoothie where they’re all mixed together,” she said. “Therefore, you can’t really discern whether a signal is coming from one cell type or another.”
“The advent of single-cell sequencing has really revolutionized our understanding of biology because it provides insights into each particular cell that is captured and studied,” she added.
Christine Seidman also noted that research on the heart — using both bulk and single-cell data — lags behind that of other organs due to acquisition difficulties.
“We know actually far less about the heart than we do about lots of other organs,” she said. “It's very unusual to remove a piece of a heart, and cardiac transplantation is also a life-saving therapy but very limited because of the lack of donors.”
By studying individual cells, the scientists discovered subpopulations of known cell types such as cardiomyocytes, which cause the heart to contract and relax, that were not previously known to the cardiology research community, according to Christine Seidman. While researchers have used bulk data to discover differences in cardiomyocytes in the atria and ventricles of the heart, the team’s findings shed light on differences in subtypes even within the ventricles themselves.
“What I didn't know is that if you looked within the left ventricle, you could find five different types of cardiomyocytes, and they’re different based on the RNAs that they express,” Christine Seidman said. “And those five subpopulations, the frequency that they occur in the left ventricle is different than the frequency in the right ventricle.”
She added that studying these subtypes allows researchers to learn about the developmental origins of the cells and how they manifest in an adult, physiologically functioning heart.
“There’s this enormous complexity and intricacy, which really underscores how beautifully constructed the heart is,” Christine Seidman said.
Jonathan Seidman said the study, which features seven female hearts and seven male hearts, could help researchers and medical professionals gain more insight into heart failure, the leading cause of death in the United States.
“It opens up possibilities to answering why men, for example, would have more heart failure than women,” he said. “By understanding the cell atlas, you can’t promise that you’ll understand that better, but it’s certainly a good place to start.”
These efforts are aided by the team’s discovery of the different cardiomyocyte subtypes, which helps pinpoint changes at a much more precise level, according to Christine Seidman.
“We can begin to ask whether they disproportionately affect some of the cardiomyocytes differently than others,” she said. “And that could ultimately help us to understand differences in the expression of diseases, and importantly differences in the way we could treat them by more specifically targeting precise cells.
She added that the group is working to expand their study — which is currently examining 13 hearts from Caucasian donors and one heart from an Asian donor — to a more diverse population, though this is challenging since underrepresented populations are also less frequently organ donors.
“It’s enormously important to be able to understand if there’s, you know, fundamental differences in the architecture of hearts that contribute to heart disease, because if that was true and if we learned how to treat those different populations — their cellular populations — differently, that might make huge differences in people’s health,” Christine Seidman said.
Christine Seidman said the heart cell atlas could also help engineers create artificial hearts for transplantation.
“It’s hard to construct the heart, if you don’t know what’s in it. Now, for the first time, we really have a blueprint of what it takes to make a heart,” she said.
Jonathan Seidman said the map will serve as a “very powerful tool going forward.”
“When you have a human heart cell atlas, you can start to go and explore what are the perturbations, what are the changes that occur in disease, what are the changes that occurred during cardiac development,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saeb Erekat — a Harvard Kennedy School fellow and the Chief Palestinian Negotiator of the Palestine Liberation Organization — criticized the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain’s deal normalizing diplomatic relations with Israel, saying in a Saturday interview with The Crimson that he does not believe the deal will alleviate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Erekat also criticized the United States’ role in the deal and the Trump administration’s policy in the region more broadly, saying that U.S. President Donald J. Trump has “set Palestinians and Israelis at least 50 years back.”
Trump and his son-in-law and adviser Jared C. Kushner ’03 facilitated the international agreement, also known as the Abraham Accords. According to Trump, the deal ensures that Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Israel will cooperate on issues like healthcare, education, trade, security and diplomacy, and exchanging embassies and ambassadors.
The deal has landed Trump a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.
In a rare move during a polarizing election year, former vice president and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a statement praising the accords, writing that “it is good to see others in the Middle East recognizing Israel and welcoming it as a partner.”
Erekat, however, said he does not believe the accord will advance peace and criticized the negotations for occuring without Palestinian consultation. He added that the deal appears to renege on a previous Arab League-endorsed proposal that states League members would not normalize relations with Israel without a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the establishment of Palestinian state.
“The real problem here is between Palestinians and Israelis. It’s not between Emiratis and Bahrainis, or Bahrainis and Israelis or Emiratis and Israelis,” Erekat said.
In criticizing Trump and Kushner, Erekat claimed the dealmaking used dirty tactics and went over the Palestinian leaders’ heads.
“When Kushner tries to tell Palestinians, ‘Look, I’m working over your head. I’m bringing Arabs to make peace with Israel. You are left alone. You’re abandoned,’ what does this mean to my people? What does it mean to the Palestinians? Is he trying to export fear to them?” Erekat asked.
He also said Trump’s policy toward Israel and Palestine is more harmful than that of previous administrations.
“Other presidents — I’m not saying they were not pro-Israel — but at least they were trying to achieve a two-state solution on 1967 lines for us to live and let live. That’s what we were negotiating, and we came a long, long, long way,” Erekat said. “This man and this administration, what they did so far have managed to set Palestinians and Israelis at least 50 years back.”
The White House could not immediately be reached for comment on Erekat's criticisms.
In the interview, Erekat said he felt honored to hold the fellowship at the Kennedy School and addressed some of the controversy surrounding his appointment.
He said he appreciated Harvard’s decision to provide a platform to both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, referring to former Israeli foreign minister Tzipi M. Livni, who held the same fellowship last year.
“Tzipi Livni was my counterpart for many years, and we dealt with each other,” Erekat said. “We differed, yes. We had agreements, yes. And for Harvard to have her and then to have me, that shows what Harvard is. It’s a great university.”
Along with the rest of the Kennedy School, Erekat’s fellowship will take place entirely online due the coronavirus. He said the transition to meeting online with students and diplomats has been difficult but believes it is necessary.
“I need to get used to that,” he said. “I believe in the human factor, in body language and eye contact.”
Erekat’s appointment has brought controversy, following allegations that his beliefs are anti-Semitic and reports — which Harvard spokesperson James F. Smith denied — that the Palestinian Authority paid the University nearly two million dollars for Erekat’s fellowship.
Critics, such as pro-Israel advocacy group StandWithUs, have criticized Erekat’s appointment, calling him anti-Semitic and pointing to his words refusing to recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
Erekat dismissed the criticisms and condemned anti-Semitism in the interview.
“My conflict with Israel is not a religious one. It is a political one, territorial one, narrative one,” Erekat said. “Anti-Semitism is evil.”

Let’s be real: quarantine hasn’t been the most exciting. We’ve all been trying to recreate the campus chatter at home, and you or your blockmates have probably discovered the allure of Harvard Confessions. Along with Samyra’s tea times on Instagram, the Harvard Confessions Facebook page has been utilized as a platform to anonymously post hot takes, thirsty propositions, and angry rants. If you’ve ever wondered about the behind-the-scenes details, Flyby has got you covered with an interview from an admin who asked to be anonymous to preserve the nature of the Harvard Confessions page.
1. Did you start Harvard Confessions? When did it get started?
HCA: Basically I was seeing MIT confessions and I was like, Oh, why doesn’t Harvard have a confessions page? So, I created it in February of 2019.
2. For those unfamiliar with the page, what are three words you would use to describe it?
HCA: Relatable, diverse, and whack.
3. My friends have definitely sent me whacky confessions on the page. Do you guys have a confession hall of fame?
HCA: No [laughs], but we definitely should in the future.
4. Like print some out and put it on a wall?
HCA: Yeah, that would be really fun.
5. Do you think professed-love and thirsty confessions have ever led to any relationships? Could it ever replace Datamatch?
HCA: I don’t think so…I think what our peers are doing are great but also…Datamatch is sponsored by restaurants and students can actually meet up, whereas for us, we’re a platform where students can profess their love anonymously and just hope for the best.
6. Have you ever submitted a confession?
HCA: In the beginning, yeah, just because we needed to get stuff off the ground. But nowadays, there’s way too much to go through.
7. So the coronavirus happened and it really looks like the page blew up. Any thoughts about why? 
HCA: People are probably using Confessions as a way to virtually feel like they’re still on campus or connected with fellow students…in March, the page activity definitely ramped up. 
Yes, you can talk to your friends, or DM people, but I think it’s very different than having a common space [like Confessions].
8. Has it been more difficult running the page?
HCA: Definitely! Along with more submissions, we got more demands. Like if we didn’t post something fast enough, we would get more submissions asking why we didn’t post it. And it’s not a personal vendetta… I mean like, we don’t even know who you are!
9. What’s something that people would be surprised to hear about the behind-the-scenes of running the account?
HCA: We actually read everything and we discuss everything…And the fact that we get 200-300 submissions per day, so when people complain or say we aren’t approving them fast enough, we really can’t [laughs].
10. So how do you decide which ones get posted?
HCA: We usually filter for some sort of quality. As in, it should be funny, interesting, relatable. Originally we wanted to remain completely apolitical, but when we don’t post, people accuse us of censoring and agreeing with the opposing side… we try to do a balance of posting both sides. The ones that have too much profanity or are too offensive, or directly call out individuals, we try to steer away from those...Anything that we know for a fact is false, we definitely also won’t post, like a lot of hearsay that tarnishes an organization’s reputation. 
11. Overall, it’s been pretty popular among Harvard students. Why do you think people submit to it? Why do you think people like reading it?
HCA: Maybe, for some people it’s seeking validation… For others, seeing if their opinions are a hot take or a cold take. Maybe they feel like this is a good platform to share their thoughts. And for other people, some sort of clout or entertainment?
12. Describe the page as a singular HUDS dish.
HCA: The Make Your Own omelet stations. I guess metaphorically, Confessions is what the student body puts into it and each omelet comes out differently based on what you put in it.
13. So how many of you are there?
HCA: It’s half our blocking group, so 4 of us. We’re actually looking to bring in new moderators since we’re all seniors now, so definitely looking for younger moderators to join the team. Take the torch please! 
14. Going off of that, what do you see as the future of the page once you’re gone?
HCA: Just hope that the page continues as long as Facebook is alive.
ESD: Oh, Zuck.
HCA: (laughs) Yeah...it’s a really good community for people to highlight issues that aren’t normally talked about. And hopefully a space where people can relax, chill, talk about funny things, and spread campus gossip. 
So if you’re ever bored, whether you’re in quarantine or at school, check out the Harvard Confessions page on Facebook. We promise it’ll (probably) be worth your time.
