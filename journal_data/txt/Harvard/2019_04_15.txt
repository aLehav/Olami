After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 5, the Harvard Electronic Music Collective invited the artist trio Cheat Codes to speak to students and other attendees at Sever Hall. The LA-based DJ trio includes Trevor Dahl, Matthew Russell (real name Matthew Elifritz), and KEVI (Kevin Ford). The group currently has over 15 million monthly listeners on Spotify and spoke at Harvard about their production process and the hard work behind their rise to fame.
The group spoke to The Harvard Crimson before the event about their meteoric rise in dance music. “It’s cool ‘cause it really wasn’t that long ago that we were just fans of the music wanting to do it,” Dahl said. “A few years ago, we were all in the room talking about wanting to be DJs and wanting to do it, and we were just on a flight with Zedd a couple of days ago and now we’re buddies with him.”
The group also expressed their excitement at coming to Harvard. “When I heard that they were doing a discussion on dance music, I was pretty surprised, so I’m interested to see what the students are into, what they know, what they don’t know,” Elifritz said.
The event functioned like a seminar, with Dahl spending the first half of the event walking the audience through the process by which the group remixed Maggie Lindemann’s song “Pretty Girl.” They displayed the components of the track on a screen, allowing audience members to request components of the song to discuss. While the discussion of “Pretty Girl” moved from bass to vocals to drums, the group kept using the term “ear candy” to describe interesting moments in the music meant to complement the vocals. “If it sounds good to you, you’re doing it right,” Dahl said.
The nature of the event allowed the group to engage with the audience before the Q&A portion of the discussion. At one point, Dahl asked the members of the audience if they knew what “sidechaining” was. After most members raised their hands, the group proceeded to use technical language throughout the event. Even though much of the audience was familiar with production jargon, Cheat Codes assumed a teaching role, making sure to define technical terms along the way.
An audience member asked the group if they had new songs that have not been released yet. After a few words amongst themselves, they decided to play two new, unreleased songs for the audience. Both were greeted with tremendous applause.
In the Q&A portion of the event, the conversation steered towards the group’s songwriting process. Elifritz discussed how Cheat Codes’ music evolved over time. “We’re songwriters. We didn’t really know anything about dance music,” he said. The group started out writing songs that they hoped prominent producers would pick up. German produced Moguai became the first major DJ to take on one of their songs.
After this success, Cheat Codes still struggled to get their music released. “During that time period, we’d write 10 songs and maybe one of them would get picked up by another DJ,” Elifritz said. They initially sent their song “Sex” to Norwegian DJ Kygo, who turned it down. As of today, the single has been streamed over 500 million times on Spotify.
Audience member Avanti S. Nagral ’20 appreciated the candidness with which Cheat Codes spoke, particularly in explaining their creative process. “As a producer, you have so many different moving parts and elements that you’re working with,” Nagral said. “It’s interesting to see if they have a process.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’ve probably heard Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” at some point in the past month. Maybe you were scrolling through memes on your phone, or maybe it was blasting over the speakers at a party. Maybe you were with your country music-loving roommate, or maybe you were visiting your trap music-loving grandma. Whatever the context, you were probably perplexed — perhaps even intrigued. Just where did this song come from? How does it relate to TikTok, the video-sharing app? And is that Billy Ray Cyrus singing a verse? “Old Town Road” has clearly been through quite a journey to get where it is.
Like most influential masterpieces, the song comes from humble beginnings. In 2018, Montero Lamar Hill (who later took on the rap moniker Lil Nas X) had just dropped out of college to pursue a music career. This decision was first met with the usual outcome: failure and familial disappointment. Lil Nas X, however, did not give up. In fact, the soon-to-be star turned this shame into inspiration for a song he hoped would be his big break. He casts himself as a trendy cowboy, with the success that he so desires represented by — you guessed it — an “old town road.” The song then becomes a symbol of hope — as Lil Nas X croons, “I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road,” he suggests that his dreams are, indeed, within reach.
But as beautiful as this imagery may be, it’s certainly not enough to make a song go viral. Fortunately, Lil Nas X had a trick up his sleeve: Internet savviness. He thought that if he uploaded the song to apps like TikTok, it could rise to fame as a meme. He was right.
“Old Town Road” quickly became part of a cowboy-themed challenge on TikTok, and from there its fate was sealed. After it was officially released as a single by Columbia Records, it began to appear on music charts across the world. At one point, “Old Town Road” was even one of the top hits on Billboard’s “Hot Country Songs” chart — until it wasn’t. Controversially, the magazine decided to remove the song from consideration as a country song, noting in a statement to Rolling Stone, “While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.”
Understandably, this move sparked considerable frustration. This was an insult to a song that many genuinely enjoy. On a deeper level, however, Billboard’s decision is reflective of a greater issue: country music’s exclusive nature, particularly toward people of color.
Country has come to be dominated by largely white artists, and past attempts to diversify the genre have been met with great hostility. Notably, superstar Beyonce’s foray into the genre, “Daddy Lessons,” was reportedly rejected by the 2016 Grammys for consideration under the country category, despite her performing the song at the Country Music Awards earlier that year. “Old Town Road” was just the latest in a long line of innovation by a black artist being shot down with superficial justification.
This did not stop Lil Nas X, however. For one, the song was already a hit with fans across the world, cementing its place as one of the most memorable tunes of 2019. In addition, Lil Nas X adopted a philosophy that we could all benefit from using: “When in doubt, turn to Billy Ray Cyrus.” On April 4, Lil Nas X released a remix of “Old Town Road,” this time featuring several verses sung the famed country star (and Disney father).This was certainly a response to Billboard’s assertion that the song is “not country enough,” and it quickly grew to rival the original in popularity.
To make things better, “Old Town Road” lept to the very top of Billboard’s top 100 on April 8, dethroning Ariana Grande’s eight-week reign at number one. Will Smith has even expressed interest in starring in a music video for the song. Clearly, we have not heard the last of “Old Town Road,” or of the genius whose “Gucci hat” started it all, Lil Nas X.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Memories clouded my brain as I heard responses to the divestment protest that had just happened. I had just come from a meeting where we watched the newly-leaked video and praised the way the protesters’ made their cause known and refused to be silenced. We wrapped up a meeting in the Phillips Brooks House parlor room when a police officer walked in. He asked if any of us had been involved in the protest. We responded that we had not, but the police presence resonated with me.
When I was in another room later with opinions that opposed mine, I pulled together enough energy to recount previous encounters with police. I thought back to the Republican National Convention, when I was part of a group of immigrant rights protesters putting together a ‘Wall off Trump’. Members linked their arms to create a wall of unity. I remember the line of police facing us in our vulnerable states as we risked arrest. I remember how the police faced us, prepared to take action.
I compared that to the way I saw police circling a group of right-leaning protesters at the Democratic National Convention the following week. Their backs were to the protesters. They faced the rest of the crowd and protected the protesters’ right to free speech with their own bodies. While their rights were protected, we were vilified. We were targeted.
This was one of the first examples I had that showed me the way “freedom of speech” is skewed to protect hate speech and to police marginalized communities. Another recent example brings us to the University of Arizona, where students were charged for protesting an event on their campus earlier this month. Students noted that the presence of representatives from Customs and Border Protection made them feel unsafe.
While the freedom of speech of the CBP presenters was protected, that of the protesters was deemed a disturbance. Freedom of speech being trumped with the excuse of disturbance of the peace feels like a direct way to limit discourse coming from the left from people who don’t have the resources or platforms to be heard otherwise.
When we tie these larger issues to the events that took place at the Institute of Politics forum with University President Lawrence S. Bacow, similar possibilities present themselves. We have yet to see if action will be taken against the protesters, but we already see a pattern of policing right on Harvard’s campus.
The divestment protest was not an independent event. The protesters shut down the IOP event in response to the continued silencing they faced when meeting with Bacow as they were met with the statement, “I don’t respond to demands, I respond to reason.” Bacow repeated this patronizing claim during the IOP protest and continued his response with the question of what kind of community we want, as if we really have a say in the matter. He exposed the power disparity by doing so.
The way that this community is structured now is not sustainable for everyone. The foundation on which this institution was created is not sustainable for everyone. All the voices in the community are not being heard because they’re not all represented in positions of power since it was not built with everyone in mind.
The foundation of this institution was flawed from the start, but Harvard still has an opportunity and duty to rebuild it. We should be building a community where we listen to demand because it comes out of another ideology that is often neglected. We should be building a community where we are not leaving collateral damage as this institution tries to get ahead. This is what Divest is pushing for. These are the demands that are getting ignored.
I have been a student at Harvard for 958 days, and I have seen the silencing of marginalized students far too many times. Bacow has made it abundantly clear that the voices of students don’t matter. It seems like the choice is only the administration’s.
The choice should be ours.

Halfway up the 17 flights of stairs to my apartment, I thought my heart might burst. This was partly because I hadn’t exercised since returning to Cambridge for my last semester of graduate school. But it was also because I was growing more enraged with every step. Harvard University Housing had been turning off my building’s water for days to work on a damaged pipe. And that day — a day the elevators coincidentally broke down — HUH told me I would have to move into a different unit for a week while they worked on the pipe behind my bathroom wall. When I finally made it up the stairs, out of breath and out of patience, I found the wall ripped out and the toilet in the bathtub.
No, I would not be getting any rent back, they told me as I stood dumbfounded in the building's management office, barely containing the rage bubbling up inside of me like lava. I have no idea what I learned that day in class. I only remember feeling like I’d lost my mind.
At the risk of sounding sappy and elitist, I want to be clear: I love Harvard. Not a day goes by here where I don’t feel some form of imposter syndrome, dwarfed, as I regularly am, by the towering presence of my teachers and classmates. I was lost in my career, and I feel lucky to have this time now to reset, to make new friends, and to try and tackle some of the world’s toughest challenges. Most days, I’m sure I walk around with that dreamy look of happiness I used to resent seeing on other people’s faces.
But then I come back to my Harvard-owned apartment, which has seen flooding, broken amenities and near-constant construction ever since I started paying the expensive rent, and the spell is broken. If Harvard is the dream, Harvard Housing is surely a nightmare — one I would advise prospective students to avoid.
The day of the broken elevators and demolished bathroom was not the first time HUH has interfered with my graduate school experience. Since I moved in, construction workers have had to frequently walk through the apartment to complete some sort of project on the building’s balconies. That’s an annoyance I could have lived with. But when I got out of bed one rainy day last fall and realized I was standing in an inch of water covering my entire bedroom floor, I started to think I made a mistake living here. The flood — due to a leak on the roof, I was told — broke my printer and computer charger. Even worse, because I was scrambling to save my belongings without electrocuting myself, I missed a class featuring former National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice as a special guest.
Other students have horror stories, too. Last year, residents of one of HUH’s properties filed a complaint about a construction project that they said created months of “constant” noise, debris and a “dangerous” environment, especially for kids. Students were able to get back three months’ worth of rent in that case. But different problems persisted; the same apartment complex was plagued with nearly 50 false fire alarms between fall 2017 to early this year.
To be clear, Harvard Housing is not subsidized; HUH charges market rents for the 3,000 or so apartments it manages, since the University considers anything below market rate to be a form of financial aid. And, as with most housing in Cambridge, it’s not cheap; monthly rent in my apartment complex ranges from $1,854 for a studio to $4,206 for a three-bedroom. A major draw for living here is that the costly rent includes great features, like Internet, elevators, electricity, heat, and water. But when those features are suspended or only available to you if you squat in a vacant apartment for a while, as I had to, living here is simply not worth the price – no matter how many Whole Foods gift cards HUH gives tenants for their trouble. (They gave me three.)
If I were home in New York, where I’ve had my fair share of terrible housing experiences (although none requiring me to leave the apartment for days), I might have tried to renegotiate my rent or even just started paying less in this case — come what may to my credit score! But here, my options are limited. Unpaid charges on my Harvard account, including rent, means the school can prevent me from registering for future classes, requesting transcripts or receiving my diploma.
I wish I’d known how bad it could be before signing my lease. So, as the newly admitted students make their decisions about whether or not to accept their offers, I’ll be sure to tell them: Come to Harvard, but don’t live in Harvard Housing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent meeting, the Cambridge City Council Housing Committee discussed the Affordable Housing Overlay proposal currently working its way through city government. The proposal seeks to reform zoning laws to streamline the approval process for affordable housing units, incentivize affordable developers, and introduce other reforms designed to increase the supply of affordable housing for Cambridge residents.
It is heartening to see that Cambridge is finally looking to engage in serious action to tackle the problem of housing accessibility. We are hopeful that this measure will increase the supply of affordable housing around the city, ease the process by which that housing pool can be further expanded, and bring down ever-rising prices. Nevertheless, the City Council must be scrupulous in its assessment of the actual effects of this reform, especially in terms of potential adverse legal, safety, and environmental effects.
Councilors at the meeting expressed concerns about the proposal’s potential environmental impacts, including less-stringent building standards and potential tree removal. While we are sensitive to these and other environmental concerns and believe they should be deeply considered, the city must prioritize socioeconomic diversity and support over other interests that have little significance if a vibrant community is not present to reap the benefits.
Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, a former architect and urban design consultant, also questioned the city’s ability to effectively deliver promised improvements on building capacity and cost management. Carlone’s skepticism, in so far as it supports the mission of the proposal but challenges the Council to buckle down on logistics, mirrors our own perspective.
Nevertheless, the City Council must work quickly. Carlone’s questions, while critical, must be responded to with haste. The City Council must balance the need for effective reforms with efficient implementation. To that end, we encourage both a streamlined approval process and rigorous oversight.
On its face, this may seem like a contradiction, but the scale of the plan presents Cambridge with an advantage in this context. Approvals granted to developers for some affordable housing units can be testing grounds for those developers’ future projects. In keeping with our call for oversight to ensure the success of the proposal, those who fail to deliver buildings on budget that offer decent, affordable, and safe living accommodations must not be considered for further developments across the city.
This proposal offers a chance for the City Council to take stock of housing in our city and ensure the legacy of a diverse and vibrant Cambridge faithful to its roots for decades to come. Residents must step up and own that process, continuing to be vocal in Council meetings, and the City Council in turn must listen carefully and seriously to its residents’ concerns and suggestions.
In doing so, the City  Council should also adopt an approach that is cognizant of the ways in which Cambridge is changing at a neighborhood-level as well. Protecting affordable housing is important, but it must come alongside reforms oriented toward protecting affordable neighborhoods — places where not just rent but also food, clothes, and other necessities are marketed to residents of all socioeconomic status. Only in this way can Cambridge guarantee a real community of belonging for all its residents — someplace, to use the old cliche, that everyone can call home.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the decision to launch an investigation into Harvard’s head fencing coach was part of a University-level conversation about handling the accusations.
Peter Brand, Harvard’s head men and women’s fencing coach, sold his Needham, Mass. house to Jie Zhao — the father of current and former members of the team — in 2016 for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its valuation, the Boston Globe reported earlier this month.
“We had a conversation with our general counsel, and we all agreed that this was a good thing to do,” Bacow said in an interview Friday. “We tend to talk about these things together.”
At the time of the interview, Bacow said he could not recall the name of the firm but that it is one the University has “retained in other capacities.” University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to provide the name of the firm.
Zhao’s younger son, who is currently a sophomore at the College, was admitted to Harvard shortly after the 2016 real estate transaction. He is currently a member of the fencing team. Zhao’s older son graduated from Harvard in 2018 and was also a member of the fencing team.
The allegations against Brand and Zhao come in the wake of a nationwide college admissions scandal — which federal authorities dubbed “Operation Varsity Blues” — in which 50 people have been charged for participating in a scheme involving bribing university officials and submitting fraudulent test scores to earn students of wealthy parents seats at elite schools like Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown. Harvard was not implicated in that case.
Bacow said Harvard’s investigation is meant to account for potential “vulnerabilities” in its admissions process in light of the nationwide admissions scandal and the allegations against the fencing coach.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay first announced that Harvard was investigating Brand in an email to FAS affiliates April 4.
In the interview Friday, Bacow said coaches were also being “re-trained” in Harvard’s conflict of interest policy following the scandal. Bacow maintained that the situation was an “opportunity to learn” for Harvard.
“It's incumbent upon us to try and not just learn from our own mistakes but learn from other people's mistakes,” Bacow said.
In a March interview, Bacow told The Crimson that Harvard does “some things very differently” from some of the schools that were implicated in the nationwide college admissions scandal. On Friday, he reiterated that sentiment, but also said that Harvard is not fully immune to some of the problems uncovered across the country.
“If somebody is determined to commit fraud, there are ways that they will find ways to commit fraud,” Bacow said. “We can have controls in place that will make it harder for them to do it, that will ensure that over time we'll perhaps discover it. But, there are no processes that are so airtight that we can be confident that nobody will ever succeed in manipulating the system.”
On Friday, Bacow also restated some of the protocols that Harvard follows in its admissions process, including making decisions in open committee with roughly 40 people voting instead of placing undue weight on individual people’s endorsements for candidates.
“We rely upon people fundamentally being honest, and I think most people are,” Bacow said. “We have expectations that everybody who works at Harvard is committed to the highest standards of honesty and integrity.”

This Thursday, Harvard’s graduate student union will air video ads on prime-time national television criticizing the University’s response to sexual harassment complaints, according to a union press release.
Harvard Graduate Students Union — United Automobile Workers is in its sixth month of contract negotiations with the University that began in October. HGSU-UAW has repeatedly called for including a provision that would allow student workers to pursue a third-party grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
The ads will begin airing April 18, one year after the majority of Harvard’s eligible student workers voted to support unionization.
The thirty-second advertisement — which will air on channels including CNN, MSNBC, and ESPN — opens with a narrator saying Harvard has a “world-class reputation, and a world-class #MeToo problem.” It goes on to reference the ongoing Title IX investigation into Government Professor emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez. The campaign will also extend to billboards, radio, and digital media, according to the press release.
HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Cherrie N. Bucknor wrote in an email that the union decided to run ads because the University has “consistently refused to agree” to the union’s proposals on harassment and discrimination.
“We are sending a message to the Harvard administration that we will not back down,” Bucknor wrote.
Bucknor acknowledged that the campaign will require “significant resources,” but she wrote that the union has the “backing” of its international affiliate, United Automobile Workers.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Friday that third parties cannot dictate outcomes in campus sexual misconduct proceedings.
“Third parties have no control over employees at Harvard,” Bacow said. “They have no authority to act in ways that the University can its own investigations. The University has certain responsibilities under Title IX that we believe cannot be delegated to third parties.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain also referred to previous statements on the union’s calls for these procedures.
“Since October, there has been and continues to be an active exchange of proposals and counter proposals,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
Swain also wrote that students should consider sharing their opinions about Harvard’s Title IX processes through a University-wide survey about sexual misconduct on campus.
“A powerful vehicle for students to continue to drive change in the University's resources around Title IX, including changes to policy and procedures, is through the current Sexual Assault and Misconduct Survey that is open through April 30,” Swain added. “The results from the previous 2015 survey drove an expansion in resources devoted to addressing and preventing sexual assault and harassment.”
HGSU’s advocacy has also extended into the realm of city governance. The Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a policy order last Monday supporting the union in its negotiations with the University.
The order resolves that the City of Cambridge “stands with” student workers in their calls for increased pay and benefits, a third-party grievance procedure for discrimination and harassment complaints, and more frequent bargaining sessions in order to negotiate a contract that will “take effect by the 2019 fall semester.”
Councillors Sumbul Siddiqui, E. Denise Simmons, and Timothy J. Toomey, as well as Mayor Marc C. McGovern, sponsored the order. Siddiqui and Simmons appeared at a HGSU-UAW rally last month.
Simmons called Harvard’s treatment of its graduate student workers “embarrassing” in remarks before the order came up for a vote.
“Harvard is an esteemed institution, and does it a lot of good things in our city, in our state, in our country, and this is the dark side,” Simmons said. “This is where they have dropped the ball.”
McGovern wrote in an email to The Crimson that Harvard “needs to step up.”
“Graduate students are essential to universities and should [be] appropriately compensated for their work,” McGovern wrote. “I stood with Harvard grad students when they started their union and I stand with them today.”
Swain declined to comment directly on City Council order, but wrote that the University is negotiating in “good faith.”
“To date, more than 23 meetings have been held, including full bargaining sessions, as well as smaller group subcommittee meetings to focusing on specific proposals,” he wrote.

Roughly 600 customers of Eversource, an electric company, lost power Saturday evening after a transformer caught fire on Green Street and Putnam Avenue, affecting University affiliates living in several Lowell House swing housing buildings, according to Eversource.
A transformer — an electrical box that facilitates the transfer of electricity from power plants to households — caught fire atop a utility pole at approximately 8:21 p.m., according to Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick. Members of CPD, Cambridge Fire Department, and Eversource responded to the scene of the fire, the cause of which remains unknown, according to Reid Lamberty, manager of media relations in Massachusetts for Eversource.
Most of the power outages occurred on Green Street and Putnam Avenue, according to Lamberty. Additionally, Lowell swing housing located at 20-20A and 22-24 Prescott Street also experienced a loss of power.
Though residents of Lowell swing housing had their power restored by 11:30 p.m. on Saturday evening, all affected households regained power by 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning, according to Lamberty. Residents are temporarily receiving power through a generator until the company replaces the utility pole.
Green Street resident Doug J. Necastro said that he was at home Saturday night with his girlfriend and sister when he heard “two loud bangs” at around 8:20 p.m.
“It sounded like explosions basically and then the lights immediately went out,” he said.
Doug Necastro’s sister, Kelly Necastro, said that she was in the shower washing her hair when they lost power.
“I could sense with my eyes closed that it got darker and then I was a little afraid to open my eyes and I questioned if I was still alive,” she said.
Doug Necastro said that he “got everybody together, came outside, and just watched from there.” On the street, he observed that the pole was "completely engulfed in flames.”
Over on Prescott Street, Lowell swing housing went completely dark.
Lowell resident tutor Mahnum Shahzad sent an email to Lowell affiliates Saturday night to inform them of the power outage and offer help to those who may need it.
“While facilities is working on getting power back as soon as possible please email me if you have any accessibility concerns,” she wrote.
Lucy B. Devine ’20 visited a friend in Lowell swing housing during the power outage.
“Everything was beeping, and everything was flashing, and it seriously felt like a horror film. It was so creepy,” she said.
Others were in their dorm rooms at the moment the lights went out.
Lowell resident Anthony A. Aybar ’20 said he was in his room playing Super Smash Bros. and watching the Golden State Warriors playoff basketball game with his roommates when the power went out.
“We were shocked because we thought it would be a moment type of thing. We tried turning on the lights and that didn’t work,” he said.
Aybar relocated to the Lowell dining hall where he and friends played a game of Bananagrams as they waited for the power to be restored.
CPD and Eversource spokespeople both wrote that they are investigating the cause of the fire.

Salma Abdelrahman ’20 was sitting in a Phillips Brooks House Association meeting when she found out she was one of 62 students across the country named 2019 Truman Scholars, a graduate scholarship for college students committed to public service.
The award, established by Congress in 1975, offers up to $30,000 to recipients to pursue work in public service upon graduation. This year, candidates were evaluated based on their “academic success and leadership accomplishments, as well as their likelihood of becoming public service leaders,” according to the Truman Foundation press release.
Abdelrahman, an African and African American Studies concentrator, said that during the meeting at PBHA, where she serves as vice president, a fellowships tutor sent her a text message conveying the good news.
“The text was just like, ‘YOU GOT IT!’ in all caps, and I was like ‘What? Who is this?’” she said. “Then I realized what she was talking about and it was kind of crazy. I got forwarded the [Truman Foundation] email sent to [University] President [Lawrence S.] Bacow as well.”
Abdelrahman said she was first motivated to apply to the Truman Scholarship when she found out about the opportunity through her friend Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19, who received the honor last year.
Abdelrahman said much of her time on campus has been spent organizing around prison abolition, including working with the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Advocacy and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign. HPDC has recently garnered attention for its efforts to persuade Bacow to divest the University’s nearly $40 billion endowment from companies with ties to the prison industry.
“The folks at the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign have 100 percent made me a better organizer and a better person,” Abdelrahman said. “The service work that I do is grounded in the belief of a world in which prisons don’t need to exist.”
She also cited a class on mass incarceration that she took with History and African and African American Studies Associate Professor Elizabeth K. Hinton that has inspired both her studies and her advocacy. Hinton also recommended Abdelrahman for the scholarship.
“Professor Hinton marries academia and service so clearly that I just draw a lot of inspiration for her in what I do outside the classroom,” Abdelrahman said.
Abdelrahman said she will use the coming year to decide how she plans to make use of the scholarship funding.
“Before I decide, I am definitely going to take time to do organizing work and be on the ground for a little bit,” she said. “And then I’ll decide what skills I need based on what the work looks like and what I feel is most necessary to continue furthering the project of social justice.”
Abdelrahman said she is interested in pursuing graduate studies in law or public policy, but that she is keeping her options open for the time being and focusing on showing her gratitude for the award through service.
“In terms of getting the honor, this award is not just mine,” she said. “The communities that build me up are the people who deserve this award just as much as I do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to fund an electric scooter sharing program, a music and comedy event, and a promotional video for a freshman pre-orientation program at its weekly meeting Sunday afternoon.
Pforzheimer House Representative Athena W. Kan ’19 and seven other council members, most of whom represent houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, requested $3,000 from the UC’s burst funding to support Scoob, an electric scooter sharing company run by Nestor O. Tkachenko ’21.
The company currently owns and operates two scooters on campus, which students can rent via an app. They applied for funding from the UC as well as other Harvard sources to raise enough money to purchase roughly 20 additional scooters, according to Tkachenko.
In the pilot program, Scoob will only operate within the Harvard campus, but scooters will be available for all to use. Harvard students will be given a subsidized rate of 50 cents to begin a rental plus 10 cents per minute, while non-Harvard students will pay a $1 flat rate plus 50 cents per minute, according to the proposal.
By granting this money to Scoob, the UC ensured priority for Harvard students when scooters need to be charged. By downloading an additional app, users can see when scooters are low on battery and be reimbursed for charging scooters. The UC logo will also be placed on the scooter and “prominently placed” within the app.
Dunster House Representative Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20 also proposed legislation to fund “Laugh Tracks: A Night of Music & Comedy with JR De Guzman,” a project co-sponsored by a capella group Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones and improvisation group Three Letter Acronym Improv.
Krishnan-Jha said she planned the event to help improve the accessibility of professional careers in comedy in response to what she sees as a lack of inclusivity in the comedy scene at Harvard.
“There are a few exclusive organizations on campus that bring a lot of professional comedy writers and actors and performers to only their exclusive spaces,” she said.
The event's planners requested $2,600 to ensure free admission to all interested students, covering JR De Guzman’s performance fee in full. Guzman is a musician and comedian who has appeared in comedy specials on Netflix, Hulu, Comedy Central, and MTV.
The event is currently scheduled for April 29.
The UC also granted $500 to the First-Year Retreat and Experience to create a promotional video to help the group advertise to incoming freshmen. FYRE, a new freshman pre-orientation program targeted toward under-resourced students, launched in August 2018.
Multiple projects also received funding through the Grant for an Open Harvard College, which provides funding for activities that address certain “compelling interests” delineated by the UC. These projects included Identities Fashion Show’s Coco Rocha Modeling Bootcamp, the “Covenant of Love” concert taking place during the Arts First festival, the Global Health and Leadership Conference, and the India Business Summit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of activists protested outside of Harvard’s Arthur M. Sackler Museum on Friday, urging the University to remove the late medicine marketer’s name from campus and refuse future donations from the Sackler family.
Wielding posters displaying photos of family members and friends lost to opioid overdoses, the protesters criticized institutions bearing the Sacklers’ name for being complicit in the opioid epidemic. Since the 1990s, more than 200,000 Americans have died of opioid abuse.
“It’s the right thing to do,” said Mary Peckham, a Halifax, Mass. resident who held a sign at Friday’s rally with photos of her late son, Matthew, a victim of the opioid crisis.
While some members of the Sackler family still serve as executives at Purdue Pharma, which manufacturers the addictive painkiller OxyContin, Arthur Sackler died in 1987, nearly a decade before the drug came to market. Many activists, though, hold him responsible for developing the aggressive marketing techniques that Purdue’s sales team would later use to distribute its product to pharmacies and doctors across the country.
Massachusetts-based opioid grief groups organized the protest, which was the latest effort in a months-long campaign pressuring Harvard to remove the Sackler name from its campus. More than 14,700 people signed an online petition calling for the removal of the Sackler name, and dozens of mothers of opioid victims sent letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow in March with that objective. In June 2018, activists held a protest inside the museum.
Bacow responded to the mothers in March, writing that their letters “deeply moved” him, but that the University “does not have plans” to remove Arthur Sackler’s name.
Activists said recent developments have given them newfound momentum. Multiple attorneys general have recently brought lawsuits against Purdue, revealing the company’s tactics used to push its dangerous painkiller, even after its executives knew of the drug’s potential for abuse. The company now faces more than 1,600 lawsuits in state and federal court and is considering filing for bankruptcy.
In late March, Purdue and members of the Sackler family agreed to pay $270 million to settle an Oklahoma lawsuit, and other suits — including one in Massachusetts — could be fought out in court.
Just days before the Oklahoma settlement, Tate Galleries — which runs multiple prominent art museums in England — said it would refuse any future financial donations from the Sackler family. The Smithsonian, which has an art gallery named after Arthur Sackler, has so far resisted calls to remove his name.
“Shame on you — every single one of you — for not having a conscience,” Cheryl Juaire, founder of grief group Team Sharing Massachusetts, shouted into a megaphone at Friday’s rally, referring to Harvard and other institutions that have not yielded to protesters’ demands.
A spokeswoman for Jillian Sackler, widow of Arthur Sackler, did not respond to a request for comment.
Jillian Sackler addressed the recent calls to remove her husband’s name from institutions around the world in an op-ed published Thursday in the Washington Post, writing that protesters are engaging in “guilt by association.” She said none of the lawsuits filed against Purdue or specific members of the Sackler family name “Arthur or his heirs” as defendants.
“Vilifying an innocent man is wrong,” she wrote. “It is profoundly hurtful to his family and to institutions such as the Smithsonian that are now unjustly under pressure to distance themselves from his name and his gifts.”
She wrote that the accusation that the marketing techniques her husband pioneered are to blame for the crisis is “as ludicrous as blaming the inventor of the mimeograph for email spam.”
Harvard spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the activists’ most recent calls for the University to remove Arthur Sackler’s name from the museum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly fifty students gathered on the steps of Memorial Church Saturday afternoon to demonstrate support for democratic governance in Sudan.
The country’s longtime autocratic ruler President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in a military coup on Thursday. Since December, when the price of bread in the country tripled, thousands of anti-regime protesters have demonstrated in the capital city of Khartoum and across Sudan. Sudanese activists estimate that at least 50 people have been killed and more than 800 have been arrested since protests first broke out.
“For the first time in 30 years, there was an actual feeling that we are pushing towards democracy in our country,” student organizer Sahar M. Omer ’20 said to the cheering crowd.
General Awad Ibn Ouf, formerly the defense minister under al-Bashir, instituted himself as a replacement leader for a day before handing power to another general, Abdel-Fattah Burhan, on Friday. The protesters continue to call for a democratic government instead of a military regime.
“The Sudanese students on campus — there are 14 of us, and I am so happy to call them my brothers and sisters from Sudan — have organized this protest to bring awareness to what is happening, but also to give support for the people in Sudan who are in the diaspora who are calling for a democracy,” Omer said.
Throughout the half-hour demonstration, students chanted in Arabic and English, including using a popular phrase during the 2011 Arab Spring: “The people demand the fall of the regime!”
Ilham A.T. Ali ’21 led the crowd in chants, including “Kandake queens and we don’t fear you! We beat the British and we’ll beat you too!” as well as calls for the International Criminal Court to act against al-Bashir.
“Many people still are being killed. We’re doing this for all our siblings in Darfur and South Sudan,” Ali said. “The regime has fallen twice in the past couple of days. It will fall again until we get the democratic civilization we’re asking for.”
Leena A. Hamad ’21, who attended the event and spoke to the crowd, also said she hoped the military regime will lose power.
“The people of Sudan cannot go on like this. We cannot suffer 30 more years like this. The people of Sudan do not deserve another military regime,” she said, referring to al-Bashir’s reign since 1989.
In a speech at the event, Ali spoke about the how the political unrest has affected her family.
“Whenever I hit up my mom, there’s a chance she’s not picking up because she’ll be using her burner phone so they can’t track her down,” Ali said. “That’s kind of the reality activists live in in Sudan. It’s kind of like a regime of terror.”
Ali also shared a story of a friend who was arrested and beaten by the police at age 18.
“To this day, that’s the reality that is happening. People are getting shot. People are getting killed,” Ali said. “I love Sudan, but that’s the reality we all live in — it’s really difficult.”
Ahmad S.M. Saaid ’21, whose family also lives in Sudan, said the demonstration helped bring attention on campus to the ongoing plight.
“The past few months have been difficult. And just having everyone here supporting us – me and other Sudanese students on campus — when we’re so far from home, so far removed from the cause, yet so in the middle of the cause at the same time, it’s truly amazing and it’s more than I could ever hope for,” he said.
Mohamad Y. Khalifa — a Sudanese Arabic instructor in the African Language Program at Harvard — also spoke at the demonstration.
“I really applaud all of you who gathered here in support of the forces of change and democracy in Sudan,” he said. “It’s a very high time to say enough and to move to restore our democratic system.”
“I see the future in your eyes,” Khalifa told the protestors. “You are the fuel of our future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 16, 2019 at 12:47 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council voted against passing a statement of support for Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20 — a student activist who has repeatedly called for Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. to step down after he announced he would represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein — at their general meeting Sunday.
The proposed statement concerns Mudannayake — a Crimson design editor — and Winthrop tutor Carl L. Miller, both of whom filed conflicting reports with Harvard University Police after a confrontation in Winthrop dining hall on April 3. Mudannayake said that she approached Miller after she believed he had taken photos and videos of her while she ate dinner with a friend; Miller said Mudannayake harassed and provoked him while he ate dinner with his family.
Miller’s attorney, George J. Leontire, wrote in a letter Tuesday that Miller and his wife Valencia Miller plan to file a Title IX complaint about the incident, though Leontire said Sunday evening that the Millers have decided not to file a complaint.
After nearly 40 minutes of debate Sunday afternoon, 23 council members voted in favor of the statement, 10 voted against it, and one abstained.
Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20; Eliot representatives Max A. Gillmer ’21, Sean Sullivan ’20, and Jakob L. Gilbert ’21; and Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 co-sponsored the legislation in support of Mudannayake.
“No student should ever feel intimidated by residential staff,” a draft of the statement read. “These actions on the part of Winthrop House staff create a toxic environment for students that goes against the House system’s mission of forging a healthy link between learning and living.”
Winthrop Representative Delaney E. Tevis ’19 said at the meeting that she did not co-sponsor the statement in support of Mudannayake out of fear of retaliation.
“I was asked to co-sponsor this and I decided not to because of the power dynamic in Winthrop,” Tevis said at the meeting. “I thought that if I co-sponsored it, there could be some retaliation towards me.”
The vote comes days after Eliot House Committee presidents Terzah A. Hill ’20 and William S. Flanagan ’20 weighed in on the events in Winthrop, criticizing the Millers’ actions in the wake of the incident.
On Friday, Hill and Flanagan — a Crimson news editor — defended Eliot Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe in an email to House affiliates. The Millers filed a lawsuit against O’Keefe for defamation last week after O’Keefe sent an email to Eliot residents that said the Millers acted “unprofessionally and dishonestly” in their response to the confrontation with Mudannayake.
“We stand with Gail. We support Gail,” Hill and Flanagan wrote. “We will not tolerate acts against our community and the people like Gail who make Eliot House our home.”
The UC legislation calling for the statement in support of Mudannayake mandated that the council’s leadership send it to the entire student body and post it on Facebook — a process the council calls “Tier 1” publicity. The council’s constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the body’s entire membership for any “Tier 1” statements, meaning the message in support of Mudannayake failed to pass.
Though some UC members proposed that the council consider releasing the statement in a lower tier, the meeting adjourned before members could vote a second time on the bill.
Mudannayake said last Wednesday’s events have limited her ability to feel safe on campus.
“I think, whatever happened in the dining hall or not, I do feel like this has come to the point where it's limited my ability, as well as the people I've been working with, our ability to just be in certain places on campus and feel safe on campus,” she said. “So I would ask you guys as the UC to consider how that affects student life, because with tutors and faculty deans, there is a power imbalance there.”
Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said he does not believe it is “appropriate” to take a side in the dispute between Mudannayake and Miller.
“I don't think it's appropriate for us to do so, in an unresolved situation where we as the council haven't heard from the other party's perspective, and we didn't actually witness the events transpired,” Barclay said.
Over the course of the meeting, the Council’s members mulled varying versions of a statement in support of Mudannayake. An amendment proposed by Huesa to add a call for greater transparency in tutor hiring passed; a change proposed by Pforzheimer representative Athena W. Kan ’19 to remove Mudannayake’s name failed.
Leontire said the Millers have not offered a public position on Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein.
“The issue has never been about the free speech or right to protest by anyone,” he said. “He and his family don’t deserve to be targeted and disparaged simply because he was doing his job as a tutor in Winthrop House. They hope going forward they will be accorded the same respect they believe they have always shown to students at Harvard.”
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement that the College “is committed to ensuring that our students receive the best possible support in their residential communities.”
“As Dean Khurana stated in his recent e-mail to students, we are working with the Office of Institutional Research to gather additional information from the Winthrop community,” he wrote. “This information will provide both a clearer picture of what is happening in the House and will inform decisions on how best to address concerns that have been identified.”
Correction: April 16, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the bill "narrowly" failed to pass. In fact, the bill received 23 out of the necessary 31 votes required to attain a two-thirds majority of the entire Undergraduate Council body.
Clarification: April 16, 2019
A previous verison of this article stated that the meeting adjourned before the council could vote a second time. To clarify, the meeting adjourned before the council could vote a second time on the bill itself. The council did vote on whether to consider a revised version of the bill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the oldest rivalries in the country once again did not fail to disappoint. Records were broken and personal bests were demolished. The Harvard/Yale meet has been going on for over a century, and both the men’s and women’s team continued the Crimson’s domination over the Bulldogs in the all-time series by coming away with a victory this year.
The meet also serves as an HYOC qualification meet. Athletes who hit the standard times and marks will be able to go to England and compete against the Oxford and Cambridge teams this summer.
“Me and all my teammates went in to the meet with our number one priority to beat Yale since the rivalry is historical and the duel meet is one of the oldest meets in the country” said freshman thrower and jumper John Minicus. “We also came in knowing that the winners of each event would qualify for a Europe trip over the summer, so everyone was super competitive.”
Despite competing in this historic meet for the first time, freshmen athletes demonstrated their talent and composure with some outstanding performances. Freshman pole vaulter Alana Carroll came away with a victory with a mark of 4.01m. Her performance broke the Harvard record in the women’s pole vault.
Freshman jumper Kyle Murphy won both the men’s triple and long jump with marks of 14.91m and 7.23m respectively.
Freshmen throwers John Minicus and Sam Welsh also had commanding victories in three different events. Minicus won the javelin by over nine meters with a mark of 54.33m. Welsh dominated the shot put and the discus winning these events with marks of 15.6m and 51.48m respectively.
“I was pretty excited with the win because it scored a lot of points for the team, and a lot of the team came out and supported the javelin throwers” said Minicus. “I still have a lot to work on and there will be some tough competition to face soon, so now I am looking forward to working on some form issues to hopefully get some further distances before championships”
Preparation was key for these freshmen athletes to excel in a historically competitive meet that such high stakes.
“To prepare for the javelin and my other events, I worked hard in the first half of the week with some tough workouts” said Minicus. “I then tapered off in the second half of the week, fine tuning my technique and making sure I was rested for Saturday”.
Other notable performances came from the Crimson’s sprinters and middle distance runners. The women swept the 200m with sophomore Olivia Okoli, freshman Tina Martin, and junior Micah Meekins coming in with times of 24.22, 24.29, and 24.35 respectively. On the men’s side, sophomore sprinter Jovahn Williamson also won the 200m with a time 21.37, while senior co-captain middle distance runner Myles Marshall won the 800m with a time of 1:52.68.
“The team knew that we wanted to go down there and take care of business” said Marshall. “The HY meet is a historic meet and so one we take seriously. For me preparing for the 800 meant finding a way to get the win and the points to best set up everyone else to get the team win.”
Harvard also dominated the hurdles and jumps, even sweeping several events. The men’s team got 1-2 in the 110m hurdles with freshman Tre Hollingsworth and senior Andrew Bolze having times 14.71 and 14.88 respectively. Meanwhile, the women swept the event with freshman Jada Jones taking the victory with a time of 13.96, while juniors Livia Gauntlett and Karina Joiner followed closely behind with times of 13.98 and 14.05.
In the 400m hurdles, junior Maya Miklos got fifth all-time with a time of 59.11, while junior Jacob Mclennan won the men’s race with a time of 53.21. Erick Duffey managed to set a new personal record in the pole vault with a mark of 5.41m.
“This meet was really good for a lot of our team and definitely boosted our spirits, giving us confidence that we will do well at Heps” said Minicus. “Specifically our pole vaulters had huge days and PRs, which I know hyped up the team a lot. I think we are in a really good position heading into our last regular season meet this weekend and then Heps in three weekends, and I am excited to see my teammates exceed expectations in the following weeks.”

It is a bleak Wednesday at Jordan Field as Harvard women’s lacrosse takes on Boston University, and snow piles a foot high beyond the end line, one last lingering gift from a frigid February.
The score is 2-2, and sophomore midfielder Tessa Queri pivots back towards the center of the field as freshman midfielder Grace Hulslander approaches. Queri deftly flips the ball to an accelerating Hulslander and curls across her path, forcing Hulslander’s defender to duck underneath the overlap.
Suddenly, Hulslander breaks her momentum and feints back towards Queri, who stiffens as if preparing to receive the pass. Hulslander’s defender hesitates only for a moment, but it’s enough; she has a step on her opponent now. Queri looks on in satisfaction as her teammate pulls back and fires a rocket into the top corner to put Harvard ahead.
It’s technically an unassisted goal, but the duo’s chemistry is unmistakable. And it’s not surprising.
They went to preschool together. They also went to the same elementary school, middle school, and high school.
In fact, there are seven pairs of high school teammates on the women’s lacrosse team this year. They are: Camerin Rawson and Keeley MacAfee; Charlotte Clark and Shea Jenkins; Tessa Queri and Grace Hulslander; Olivia Gill and Julia DiNovi; Celia Concannon and Katie Muldoon; Marley Jenkins and Emily Ryan; and Kristin Burnetta and Hannah Keating. We sat down with a few of them to discuss what it’s like to take the field with old friends.
⁎⁎⁎
On the field, Tessa Queri and Grace Hulslander helped carry Christian Brothers Academy to new heights in their four years at the school. Christian Brothers has long boasted an impressive athletics culture; it has produced multiple NFL players, an NBA forward, and a number of standout college athletes.
Still, the 2016 campaign was one to remember.
“We had a great season,” Hulslander said. “We ended up winning the state championship, and we were on the same midfield line, so for both of us our hard work kind of paid off that year.”
Off the field, the two were essentially inseparable.
The pair met in preschool when they were three years old, and attended school together for more than a decade before they arrived at Christian Brothers, a small private school in Syracuse, N.Y.
“My junior year of high school, Grace and I spent, like, every single day together,” Queri said. “She basically lived at my house. It was awesome because we spent so much time together in high school. We were really close friends, and luckily it got to carry on in college too. It’s been amazing.”
Apparently, they share not only TV preferences but also TV passwords.
“Grace loves Friends so much that she has her own account on my Netflix that she would use at my house so that she could watch TV—her own TV—and it wouldn’t interfere with the settings,” Queri said.
“And we would watch Saturday Night Live together every Saturday for, like, two years,” chimed in Hulslander. “Literally every weekend.”
It is evident, just from talking to the pair, that they are constantly on the same wavelength. During the Crimson’s interview, conducted over the phone while Queri and Hulslander were on a bus to an away showdown with No. 15 Princeton, a teammate in the background asked what they were doing.
Queri and Hulslander replied, in comically perfect unison, “We’re doing an interview,” and returned to the call.
That bond, according to the pair, has helped them perform at high levels on the turf.
“I feel like we know each other as players very well, and I think that just stems from off-field chemistry as well,” Hulslander said. “We’re such good friends, and we both have, like, the same priorities in life and school and on and off the field, and I think that really helps on the field.”
It’s not inaccurate to say that Hulslander wouldn’t even be here without the older Queri. During the recruiting process, Grace counted her friend’s presence as an important factor in deciding to take her talents to Harvard.
“When I was getting recruited here, Tessa was already committed, and a big part of my choosing Harvard was that it felt like home to me because Tessa was here,” Hulslander said. “To be here with her at Harvard is, like, just surreal and heartwarming.”
At this point, both players broke into laughter. If the strength of their friendship is any indication, they are poised to continue their high school success in college for years to come.

Sophomore midfielder Celia Concannon and junior midfielder Katie Muldoon, just like their teammates from Syracuse, propelled Garden City High School to a state title during their time at the school.
Both players hail from Garden City, the town, and they were each named senior captain in their last season in high school. They played on the varsity team together and were both four-year letterwinners.
“I’ve known Katie since we were both little and we became good friends in high school when we were playing on the same team,” Concannon said.
Garden City snagged a state championship in Muldoon’s senior year (Concannon’s junior year). Ten of the seniors on that roster, including Muldoon, went on to play Division I lacrosse.
“We had a lot of fun that night,” Muldoon recounted. “Best memory of high school by far.”
The Long Island natives are delighted to be joining forces again at Harvard. They know each other’s music tastes (Celia’s favorite musician is Billy Joel) and TV habits (Katie doesn’t watch, which Celia finds “bizarre”), and they’re close off the field.
“It's been great,” Concannon said of the situation. “It has been really nice having someone who knows me from home around to talk to. Katie and I like to get dinner every few weeks and catch up on what’s going on back home.”
Muldoon feels the same way. She pointed out that having a high school teammate at Harvard is like taking a small slice of Garden City to Cambridge.
“Playing with a high school teammate in college has been such an awesome experience,” she said. “Throughout high school our team had a close-knit team culture and having the opportunity to play with a high school teammate in college is incredible. It gives me a sense of home and comfort.”
Concannon and Muldoon agree that hailing from the same hometown and high school has competitive advantages. There is, of course, intangible chemistry to be considered, but there are also tactical benefits to playing with an old friend. Communication becomes easier, according to this pair.
“Having that connection back from high school is very unique,” Muldoon said. “Team chemistry is not something a coach can teach. It’s something that takes time to develop. Playing together at Harvard has enabled our relationship and chemistry to grow even more.”
“Katie and I both play defense in zones on the left side of the field and have to work together constantly,” Concannon said. “I've been playing with her for so long that we both know what the other person is going to do.”
And, as if they didn’t know each other well enough already, their mothers are also very close.
“We’re great friends, and our moms are besties,” Muldoon said. “They just got back from a trip to Nashville together!”

Junior midfielder Kristin Burnetta and junior attacker Hannah Keating have known each other for twelve years. They have been on all the same soccer and lacrosse teams since fourth grade, including the Under Armour All-American team with the best players in the country in the summer before freshman year.
They both attended the Agnes Irwin School, a small private school near Philadelphia whose founder happened to be the first dean of Radcliffe College, Harvard’s former sister institution.
The school doesn’t have a particularly show-stopping athletic program, according to Burnetta and Keating, but occasionally one class or another comes along with a number of gifted athletes. Burnetta and Keating’s grade dominated soccer and lacrosse for four years.
In an instance of fitting symmetry, Keating is Agnes Irwin’s all-time leading goal scorer in lacrosse and Burnetta holds the same distinction in soccer.
“She had a lot of assists to me in soccer and I had a lot of assists that went to her in lacrosse,” Burnetta said. “It was kind of funny how we switched roles.”
The duo is quite close. They credit each other for providing invaluable support both in high school and at Harvard.
“Playing with an old teammate is the best thing ever,” Keating said. “No matter what we do, we always have a piece of home, and she’s the person I go to for everything. She knows me, in sports and in life too, so we have that level of closeness. She’s known me for my whole life.”
Burnetta echoed that sentiment with a laugh.
“Ditto to that,” she said. “I would say too that athletically, it’s a whole different dimension. I feel like I know what Hannah loves, lacrosse-wise, and what bothers her and how to be there for her in those tough games. And socially, it’s unreal having someone in college that you don’t have to explain anything to, that just understands your past and where you are know, someone who’s always in your corner.”
Those words are hardly empty platitudes. In her senior year of high school, Keating suffered a tough injury that threatened to put a dent in her career, and Burnetta was right there to help her work through rehab as both players transitioned into college life.
“Hannah tore her ACL twice in her senior year of high school, and I feel like it was nice…” Burnetta trailed off, faltering slightly as she recollected what was certainly a difficult sequence of events.
Keating, like a twin sister, picked up in the middle of the sentence.
“...to have Kristin there for my whole recovery,” she finished. “I had someone to pick me up and tell me everything was okay. I was always worried about going back to ‘the old me’ and how I played before. And Kristin knew that player. She honestly played a key role in getting me back to normal.”
“I mean, Hannah was injured freshman fall, which is really, really hard,” Burnetta said. “I just tried to be a confidence booster.”
The two have clearly been through a lot together, and their connection runs deep. But that doesn’t mean Keating’s exempt from some good-natured ribbing.
“Hannah is the most forgetful person about, like, items,” mentioned Burnetta. “This has lasted probably all twelve years at this point. I can’t even count the number of times that we would be in the car en route to soccer tournaments or lacrosse tournaments and she would have forgotten, like, a single cleat or her mouthguard or her doctor’s note or something. So now I always ask, ‘Hannah, do you have your cleats? Do you have this? Do you have that?’ It was a funny thing growing up.”

The Crimson is clearly a tight-knit group. With seven duos from high school linking again in college, the team’s locker room atmosphere is strong. It is hardly common to have so many longstanding ties within a team, and the players’ friendships off the field have recently translated to success on it; Harvard trounced rival Yale, 18-8, in an away duel earlier this season and recently dropped a close game to No. 15 Princeton, an impressive feat for a team with a rookie coach and in a difficult conference.
The win column, though, isn’t the only thing that matters. When asked to describe the overall dynamic, Keating laughed. “Well, it really is cool.” she said, “And it’s fun.”

There’s nothing like the fall activities fair to strike fear into the hearts of young freshmen. Suddenly people stop asking what your name is, what hometown you’re from or what your freshman dorm is, and instead start asking which consulting group you’re trying to join or what cut comp you’re completing. It’s scary. It’s overwhelming. And it’s also totally not that big of a deal. As we near the end of the semester, when everything is suddenly 1,000 times more stressful, it’s time to get real about all your commitments. Here’s the tea on clubs.
This is not high school
You don’t have to stack your resume with yearbook, National Honor Society positions, and lacrosse medals. No matter where you’re heading right after college, nobody will really care about the seven clubs you were ~kind of part of~ your freshman year. Don’t fall prey to the Harvard push to overcommit and then inevitably underdeliver. Every person has their own threshold for what they can reasonably do.
Free time > everything else
Here’s the dirtiest little secret about life: free time is the best time. Cutting down on clubs means more time to do everything else, be it p-sets or actually having a social life. You can have an extra long meal in the dhall with friends you rarely see. You can reenact the First-Year Outdoor Program and walk to the Quad. You can use your Board Plus to get a morning (not 2 a.m.) coffee, and then for once in your life get to bed at a normal time.
Focus on the good stuff
We’re not saying you should stop doing every club. Clubs can offer a fun community, a way to while away the hours, or something to talk about to your grandmother when she asks you how college is going. So stick with the ones whose meetings you genuinely want to go to. Clubs are something you choose to do, so they shouldn’t make you miserable. If a club doesn’t spark joy, let it go.
Chill out
Your merit as a person is not correlated to whether or not you make the comp for a consulting/finance/art/humor/literally anything organization. Think about it this way: everything you don’t do leaves more space to do other things, and at Harvard we’re never at a loss for things to do. Go to a talk at the Business School. Get a part time job. Actually do your readings for class. Clubs don’t have to take over your life.
This is college, and while clubs can be great (especially ones where you write for The Crimson’s Blog *wink wink*), there’s nothing like the rush of clicking “Delete this and following events” for a club meeting on your Google Calendar. Self care is knowing what you can and want to realistically commit to, and that’s something we could all use a little more of. Say it with us: Clubs! Are! Not! That! Important! Everybody! Chill! Out!
