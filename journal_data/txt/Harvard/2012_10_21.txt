After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The opening bars of Ellie Goulding’s “Halcyon” seem less the work of a nascent British pop sensation than from the bizarrely eclectic Björk. Creaky amplifier feedback fades in and out and is soon joined by a haunting, wordless vocal melody. From this eccentric start, Goulding defines her newest album as not only a continuation of the synth-heavy, danceable sound of 2010’s “Lights” but as an evolution. In her sophomore work, Goulding presents a well rounded set of songs that shares many stylistic attributes of her first album yet effectively integrates a variety of new elements. Though “Halcyon” at times suffers from overly thick production, it maintains the catchiness of “Lights” while also evidencing Goulding’s artistic maturation.
Goulding immediately establishes her stylistic flexibility on the opening track, “Don’t Say a Word.” After the eerie, Björk-like intro, the song explodes with a heavy bass drum and layers of riffs. The second verse features Goulding almost whispering over a wavering synth line; when the chorus drops, a group of background vocalists and the huge bass re-enter. These diverse elements integrate beautifully.
“Anything Could Happen,” the album’s first single, shows Goulding’s development as a songwriter in terms of music as well as lyrical themes. Its peppy sound is driven by bright, rhythmic piano chords and short vocal “oohs” that form the infectious main riff. Where “Don’t Say a Word” explores a darker palette, “Anything Could Happen” is an outpouring of exuberance. The title is not, however, an expression of the infinite potential in a new relationship as the cheerful music would have one believe; rather, the song’s climax comes as Goulding proclaims, “I don’t think I need you.” She transforms what seems the soundtrack of innocence into a triumphant expression of losing naïveté and letting go.
It is here that Goulding’s most powerful strength, her voice, becomes particularly apparent. She possesses the vocal strength to conquer huge choruses as well as the clarity to convey all of her lyrics with emotion. Unlike many British artists who Americanize their vocals (such as fellow pop diva Adele), Goulding preserves every bit of her West London inflection. And, as in “Anything Could Happen,” Goulding uses her voice as a rhythmic and harmonic instrument throughout the album to great effect. These potent flourishes serve to define her unique and innovative style.
Despite its numerous strengths, however, “Halcyon” is not without significant flaws. The songs are often overcrowded with dense instrumentation, leaving little room for the beauty of Goulding’s voice to shine through. On “Atlantis,” Goulding layers not only harp and synth sounds but also thick background vocals; together, they detract from the song’s development and clutter a pretty melody. “I Need Your Love” and “Hanging On” also fall victim to heavy-handed production: the former covers its vocal line with dark effects, and the latter is completely dominated by a blaring synth. The recurrent heaviness damages the flow and cohesion of the album somewhat, and but is relieved by the album’s more subdued moments, which include the pleasantly quiet (albeit somewhat boring) “I Know You Care.”
But these weaknesses by no means compromise the evolution that defines this album.  In “Lights,” Goulding clearly established her danceable, electro-pop sound; in “Halcyon,” she smoothly incorporates aspects of folk, dubstep, and indie rock, and succeeds in combining all of her influences to create a distinctive musical style. “Halcyon” leaves room for improvement, but is a step in the right direction and will undoubtedly find its way onto the radio.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
On a Saturday when four Harvard teams lost games at Princeton, the Crimson women’s soccer team was no exception, falling to the Tigers at Roberts Stadium. The 3-1 defeat marked Harvard’s first loss in nearly a month, as the Crimson rebounded from its Sept. 21 loss to Penn by going 4-0-2 and holding its opponents to a goal or less in each outing.
With the loss, the Crimson (7-4-3, 2-2-1 Ivy) fell eight points back of the Ancient Eight-leading Princeton (10-3-1, 5-0) with only two conference games remaining, putting an end to Harvard’s hopes of repeating as Ivy champions. The Tigers remained three points ahead of Dartmouth and Penn, which are tied for second with 12 points apiece.
“There’s obviously a lot of disappointment in that the game...took us out of contention for the championship,” junior co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “However, after the game nobody was down, and we shouldn’t have been because we came to play and played our hardest out there. It’s disappointing and tough, but nothing that we could be regretful about.”
Against Princeton, the Crimson defense held steady for the first 45 minutes, marking the fourth straight game that Harvard held its opponent without a goal in the first period. But the Crimson offense could not score either, and the teams entered halftime 0-0.
“We had some really good opportunities in the first half that we didn’t capitalize on,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “During the second half it was a battle and a really good game all the way through. There were very little adjustments; they just kept doing what they were doing the entire time. I have to tip my hat off to them. They just played a bit better than us, and I have to give them all the credit.”
Princeton senior midfielder Caitlin Blosser started the scoring with a header off a corner kick in the 61st minute. The Crimson responded with a goal from freshman forward Lauren Varela, her second of the season, in the 70th minute to tie up the contest.
But a pair of Tiger goals 90 seconds apart put the game out of reach as Princeton scored in the 80th and 81st minutes. The Tigers scored all three of their goals off of set pieces—one off a corner kick, one on a free kick, and one off of a throw-in.
“We definitely responded well to their first goal,” Johnson said. “We didn’t come out playing as hard as we wanted in the beginning, but we continued to fight, which was great. Unfortunately, Princeton took advantage of their moments in the second half, which they hadn’t in the first, and scored a couple of goals we weren’t able to respond to.”
Although before Saturday’s game Harvard still had a chance to win the Ivy League, Leone said that earlier performances in Ancient Eight play decided the championship—not just Saturday’s.
“It was just one game [Saturday] night,” Leone said. “We didn’t lose the Ivy League [against Princeton]. We needed to do better in previous games so that if we lost last night it wouldn’t have been the end. You can look at [Saturday] night and say that was it, but we put ourselves in a place where we had no room for error. There aren’t a lot of second chances in this league.”
According to Johnson, the Crimson will refuse to let Saturday’s loss change its perspective on the rest of the season.
“I think that not too much changes about our situation and how we approach the next few games,” Johnson said. “We always have individual goals for games and that won’t change [after Princeton]. This will help us for the spring, it will help us for next year, and we are not going to stop fighting. Every game matters, and we are going to come out like it’s for the Ivy League title.”

In a historical night for captain outside hitter Taylor Docter, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (8-11, 5-3 Ivy) rallied from a first-set loss to beat Dartmouth, 3-1, on Friday night at the Malkin Athletic Center.
With an 8-4 lead in the fourth set, a Docter kill put the senior in a tie for 10th on the Crimson’s all-time career kill list.
“She has been developing her game all throughout college and hasn’t hit that wall,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “She came in this year in season ready to go. She is a hard worker and she deserves it.”
After winning the first set, the Big Green (2-16, 1-7) spent most of the night chasing the Crimson, which ran away with the second set and never lost momentum. Harvard came out on top, 22-25, 25-13, 25-20, 25-20.
With the Crimson leading, 11-10, in the opening set, Dartmouth took control of the frame, going on a 12-4 run and eventually closing out the game.
But the first-set loss did not rattle Harvard. A block by freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte sparked a 17-5 run that gave the Crimson a decisive second-set victory. Docter contributed six digs and five kills in the set.
“[Dropping the first set] gave us more momentum for the second,” Docter said. “We were really frustrated, and it gave us a lot of fire to come out strong.”
Both teams made adjustments heading into the second set.
“We switched our matchup a little bit, and they did the same,” Weiss said. “But our ball control was better. Our goal was just to play good defense and transition it into a point.”
The Crimson held on to take the third, a back-and-forth set that featured 10 ties and five lead changes.
After the Big Green came from behind to tie the score at 20 in the fourth set, Harvard’s offense sealed the win. Junior right side Erin Cooney registered two consecutive kills to start a 5-0 run that culminated in the 10th kill of the evening for freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace.
The Crimson displayed balanced defense throughout the match, with Docter, junior defensive specialist Natalie Doyle, freshman setter Hannah Schmidt, and sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey all registering double-digit digs.
Holte had a career-high nine blocks, surpassing her previous high of eight against Brown.
“I was pleased by the way we kept our composure and started attacking them the way we wanted to,” Weiss said. “We have been playing at a really great speed and a really great level. Overall, especially on defense, the team effort has been really solid.”
After losing in five sets at Dartmouth earlier in the season, Harvard saw improvement in its chemistry and offensive speed on Friday.
“We [have] practiced a lot more and gotten a lot more used to the lineup we have,” Docter said. “We have started running a faster offense, which has helped a lot. We’re executing like we should.”
Friday night’s win snapped a losing streak against the Big Green that dates back to 2009.
“It was a big victory for us,” Holte said. “It was exciting to come in as a freshman and be a part of that.”
The Big Green struggled with balance offensively, as junior middle blocker Elisa Scudder was the only player to reach double-digit kills. Dartmouth’s attack relied almost exclusively on support from freshman setter Kayden Cook, who had 35 of the team’s 44 assists.
For the Crimson, Docter was supported by Cooney and Wallace, who combined for 22 kills. Harvard also benefited from the combination of Schmidt and senior setter Beth Kinsella, who combined to register 44 of the Crimson’s 53 assists.
Harvard’s current three-game winning streak is its longest this season. After opening the season 2-9, the Crimson has gone 6-2, and currently sits in a tie for third place in the Ivy League standings.
“We have gained a lot of confidence being on a winning streak,” Holte said. “Confidence in ourselves is key, not focusing on the other side. The win means a lot to us.”

Facing the second-ranked team in the nation, the Harvard field hockey team held Princeton to just one goal in the first 27 minutes.
But then the floodgates opened, as the Tigers took hold of the game with three quick goals before half. Adding three more in the second, the Tigers ultimately defeated the Crimson, 7-0, Saturday afternoon at Bedford Field.
This marks the third straight shutout for Princeton (12-1, 5-0 Ivy) and the fifth straight loss for Harvard (3-10, 1-4). The Crimson also suffered its fourth shutout of the season and its second in a row.
In the loss, co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos made a season-high 15 saves, 10 of which came before the Tigers second goal. Her 10th save of the contest marked her 500th for her collegiate career.
“She played a great game,” sophomore Noel Painter said. “I don’t think the score really reflects how many balls and blocks that she had.... She was just saving them left and right, and the score would have been much higher if we didn’t have her in cage.”
Heading into the game, Harvard was focused on defense, with its eyes set on stopping any potential threats or momentum the Tigers presented.
“We wanted to disrupt their play as much as possible,” Painter said. “Basically when one Princeton player got a ball, we tried to get as many Harvard players on them to try to get them to make a bad pass or not to be able to dribble through all of us and get a shot off.”
But in a four-minute span in the first half, junior Michelle Cesan single-handedly helped the Tigers open up a comfortable lead. At 27:21 and then at 31:08, Cesan scored unassisted goals, driving into the Harvard circle and finding the net to put Princeton up by three.
Right before halftime, with 27 seconds remaining in the period, freshman Maddie Copeland scored a goal with help from sophomore Stephanie Goldberg, capping a three-goal outburst in a seven-minute span at the end of the half.
Before those trio of goals, the Crimson held the Tigers in check for over 20 minutes after Princeton opened the scoring six minutes into the game. On that play, Tiger senior Katie Reinprecht netted an unassisted goal, her sixth of the season.
The nation’s leading scorer, Kathleen Sharkey, was shut out during that stretch and throughout the game despite her game-high 10 shots.
After over a 20-minute lull in the scoring to start the second half, the Tigers again had an offensive outburst, netting three goals over 11 minutes near the end of the game.
“They are a great team and were able to take advantage of our mistakes,” Painter said. “They were able to take it down and take advantage of us being on our heels and take a shot. Their forwards are really good and can take shots from anywhere.”
Tiger freshman Teresa Benvenuti netted two goals in succession to open up the scoring in the second half, scoring at 57:48 and 65:50 to put Princeton up 6-0.
The Tigers capped the scoring for the day with just over six minutes remaining in the contest when junior back Amanda Bird found the back of the net for her fourth goal of the season.
Against a strong Princeton squad, the Crimson was unable to record any shots in the first half but had three in the second, with senior Katelin Wahl nearly scoring on one of her two shots.
On the day, Harvard had four shots to Princeton’s 31.
“We planned to do a half-field press to give them less space and to challenge them a little more,” said freshman Elizabeth Jacobson, who had one shot on the day. “In the first half, we had trouble with the attack, but in the second half we stepped up and started to pressure them a lot more.”
The Tigers also had 11 penalty corners on the day as opposed to the Crimson's one, and Harvard had 15 saves while freshman goalie Anya Gersoff had three for the home team.
Tradtionally one of the strongest teams in the conference, Princeton has won at least a share of the Ivy crown in each of the past seven seasons and has not fallen to the Crimson since 1993. The seven-goal deficit in the defeat is the most lopsided loss for Harvard since the Tigers' 9-0 victory against the Crimson in 2009.
But despite the scoreboard, the team believes it showed progress and fight against one of the nation's top squads.
“I’m very proud of the team of how we played,” Painter said. “[It’s disappointing] to lose 7-0; it’s not fun, but I think we did show them that you can’t push us around as much as they thought they probably could. At the end of the day we were able to walk off the field with our heads held high because we did compete with the best team in country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In  this installment of a new weekly series, we break down the ins and outs  of the Harvard football team. This week, we dissect how sophomore  defensive end Zach Hodges has smothered opposing quarterbacks and  running backs.
 
Hodges  is one of the youngest members of the defensive line but has been  pivotal in helping the line suffocate running attacks and intimidate  quarterbacks. In recent games, Hodges has seen increasing playing time  at defensive end for the Crimson while offensive coordinators around the  league struggle to protect their most valuable players from his wrath. 
Hodges' combination of power and speed has helped him accrue  double-digit tackles for loss and make game-changing plays in the  backfield. Even in a loss to Princeton, Hodges was all over the field,  accruing multiple quarterback hurries, tackles for loss, and half a sack  that knocked the Tigers' main QB out of the game.

Co-captain forward Jillian Dempsey scored a goal in each of the first two periods as the Harvard women’s hockey team took down McGill, 4-1, on Saturday afternoon at Bright Hockey Center in the Crimson’s first and only preseason matchup.
Harvard controlled the game throughout, never trailing and outshooting the visiting Martlets, 29-13.
In addition to Dempsey, forward Kalley Armstrong had a big offensive day for the Crimson. The junior assisted on three of the Crimson’s four scores.
A number of different lines and defensive pairings rotated in for the Crimson during Saturday’s exhibition. In net, captain Laura Bellamy and freshman Emerance Maschmeyer split time and combined for 12 saves.
“It was good to get almost everyone on the ice together,” Bellamy said.
Facing McGill, Harvard had the edge from the start, firing three shots within the first minute. After opposing goaltender Taylor Salisbury corralled Dempsey’s first shot of the night, the senior converted on her second, giving the Crimson an early 1-0 advantage.
Harvard fell on the wrong end of the game’s first penalties, as freshman forward Dylanne Crugnale and sophomore forward Hillary Crowe served two minutes for too many players on the ice and checking, respectively. But the squad survived the early scare and surrendered only one shot, which was handled by Bellamy.
Harvard finished the contest with 14 minutes in the penalty box, due in large part to five third-period infractions.
Just minutes into the second period, early pressure paid off again for the Crimson as Dempsey tacked on a second goal. After some back-and-forth play, sophomore forward Samantha Reber extended Harvard’s lead to three by winning a faceoff that eventually led to her goal 8:53 into the frame.
McGill got on the board early in the third, but a score from freshman Miye D’Oench sealed the 4-1 Crimson win.
The matchup was the second of a three-game United States trip for the Martlets, who dropped the first by a margin of five to Dartmouth.
Harvard will open regular season play next week with a pair of road ECAC games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing off against some of the toughest competition in the nation, the Harvard women’s golf team finished tied for 14th place out of 17 teams at this weekend’s Stanford Intercollegiate.
The Crimson ended the tournament, which consisted of three rounds in as many days, with a total team score of 892 (+40) at the Stanford Golf Course in Stanford, Calif.
“I’m quite pleased with our result,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “This was a fantastic field with many of the top-ranked teams in the country. We know we can be quite competitive in this kind of field.”
Harvard’s best round came on the second day of competition, when the team combined for a 290 (+6), 14 fewer than its first-round total and eight fewer than in the third. The team score was tied for the sixth best of the day, five shots off the leader.
“We played great in the second round, and our good rounds are very good,” Rhoads said. “We just need to finish off our ‘medium’ rounds just slightly better in order to keep us more in the national conversation.”
USC took home the team title with an overall score of +5. The Trojans, who led after each day of competition, were consistent throughout the tournament, posting single-round scores of 286, 285, and 286.
USC freshman Kyung Kim captured the individual title, posting a seven-under-par 206 in the three-day tournament.
Second-place Washington finished three strokes behind the Trojans, and the host Cardinal ended tied for third with Oregon State.
Junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is a Crimson business editor, was the top scorer for the Crimson, coming in 29th. Hu posted three consistent rounds, and like Harvard, the junior’s best performance came in the tournament’s second day, when she shot a one-over-par 72.
In the first and third rounds, Hu notched scores of +2 and +4, respectively.
Hu made only one double-bogey and ended the tournament at +7.
“There were some parts of my game that I was not completely happy with,” Hu said. “But there were other parts that I was really happy with. I think overall I played well and was really happy with how I did.”
Sophomore Brenna Nelsen was the second lowest scorer for Harvard. Although Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports comper, struggled in her first round, Nelson recovered to finish at +9, two strokes behind Hu and tied for 36th place.
The Crimson’s third-place finisher, freshman Courtney Hooton, shot the same first- and second-round scores as Nelsen and took advantage of four second-round birdies to post a score of 225 (+12).
Harvard’s final scorer, freshman Christine Lin, finished one shot behind Hooton, and sophomore Tiffany Lim rounded out the Crimson squad, shooting three identical, six-over-par rounds.
The field at the Stanford Intercollegiate was almost entirely composed of schools from the western part of the country.
Aside from Georgia, Harvard was the only team from the east.
Many of those schools competing were also in the preseason top 25.
“It was really good [to go up against such big schools],” Hu said. “They were all great players, and we really appreciated the opportunity to measure ourselves against them. It was definitely a much harder tournament, but I think we did well.”
Despite the prime talent at the competition, only four players finished under par for the tournament, a testament to the difficulty of the course.
Consistency was a key to success throughout weekend, and players who found it usually were rewarded—each of the top seven finishers only made double-bogey or worse on a hole once.
Because four out of the five Crimson golfers hail from California, the trip west also provided the players an opportunity to compete in familiar surroundings.
“It was really nice,” Hu said. “Parents and family and friends all came out to watch us, so it was really great. It was a nice change from what we usually experience on the course.”
After taking third and second place in two earlier tournaments this season, the Stanford Intercollegiate marks the end of fall play as the team prepares to shift its focus to the upcoming spring season with a productive few competitions under its belt.
“I think we improved [over the course of the fall],” Hu said. “This is the strongest field of any tournament in the country. I do think that as a team we did well, and I think we showed all these other schools we have a good team.”

In this mini-series, Flyby profiles one of the seven fall 2012 IOP Fellows each week. This week: Nina J. Easton.
"Presidential coverage used to be a very serious endeavor," said self-described pundit Nina J. Easton from behind her desk at the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.  "There still are pockets of that attitude, especially among old school vets, but the culture is to get [the news] out there fast."
As an IOP fellow this semester, Easton is trying for the opposite approach. By slowing down to examine the economics at play in the 2012 election, she's aiming to provide a substantive supplement to the media's superficial look at politics.
Her study group, named "It's the Economy Stupid!" after a Bill Clinton campaign mantra, meets on Tuesdays from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the Faculty Dining Room at the IOP.  Each week, Easton brings in a high profile visitor to analyze the latest developments in the election. Her guests include Harvard economist and Mitt Romney adviser N. Gregory Mankiw, J.P. Morgan general counsel Gregory A. Baer, GOP pollster Bill McInturff, a Democratic political operative Elaine C. Kamarck, economic policy strategist David M. Smick, and former National Economic Council Director Larry H. Summers.
In an era of tweets and sound bytes, guardedness is the rule for political power players. Not so in Easton's study group. "The great thing is the study groups are off the record," Easton said. "The guests can be truly candid."
Easton, author of two books, frequent panelist on Fox News, senior editor at Fortune Magazine, and co-chair of Fortune's annual Most Powerful Women Summit, has recused herself from covering this election because her husband is a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. So when Harvard recruited her to participate in two semester-long fellowships, she packed up and moved to Cambridge last winter.
Last spring as a Goldsmith Fellow at the Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, Easton researched Americans' attitudes toward the rich in the face of growing income inequality. "I was troubled by the superficial look the media was taking," she said. "The media did not quote unquote 'discover' income inequality until Occupy Wall Street brilliantly put it into the political lexicon." Her research resulted in a Fortune cover story asking "Is It Still OK To Be Rich in America?"
Despite her conservative leanings, Easton sees the value in understanding a variety of political perspectives, and she has made an effort to represent views from across the political spectrum in her study group. At least two liberal guests (Kamarck and Summers) will help provide study group attendees with a balanced view of the economy's role in the election.
Easton wishes editors would make the same conscious effort and hire writers of diverse political views. A Berkeley liberal before she became disenchanted with entitlement programs and affirmative action, Easton thinks her media colleagues report the news with a leftist slant.
"It's really important whether you're a conservative or a liberal to always challenge the conventional wisdom, which is what I've tried to do in all my work," she said.
Easton's phone buzzed a few times during our interview, and she checked it "just in case it's my babysitter" texting her about Ellie, her four-year-old in the Radcliffe Child Care Center. As a working mother of three, Easton said, "I've made decisions along the way so I would be there for my kids, and it's kept me from going places I would have gone."
Sharon M. Stovezky '15, one of Easton's community liaisons, said she applied for the post because "I am very interested in getting to know women in positions of power, and she's one of the few in Washington journalism."
Easton's six community liaisons meet with her once a week outside of the study group and help to advertise the events to the undergraduate community. Sammy G. Young '15, another liaison, was surprised about how informal their get-togethers are. "There's no 'I'm the boss' vibe with Nina," he said. "We've gotten to know her really well."

It’s a beautiful fall morning. The sun is out, the trees are beginning to change colors, and the smell of fall is in the air. That’s not the only smell, however, that Harvard Square has to offer. Flyby is here to take you on a four stop olfactory tour of Harvard Square.
1. Imagine an early morning run along the Charles. You worked your butt off (or so you say) and now it’s time for a nice big breakfast in Annenberg. But suddenly, while walking up JFK Street, you’re hit by the smell of beans, grilled meat, and a heart attack waiting to happen. Yup, you just passed Felipe’s Taqueria, and for some reason find yourself craving a burrito.
2. As you continue up JFK, you find yourself engulfed by a cloud of perfume. It’s as if someone took all the bottles your sister keeps under the bathroom sink, mixed them together, and drenched the sidewalk right outside Lush Cosmetics. At least you won’t smell like sweat at breakfast.
3. You’ve finally made it to the newsstand in the middle of the square and are waiting to cross the street into the yard, when another smell assaults your nose. It’s a very distinct smell -- a strange combination of metal, dirt, and people packed together. You’re standing right outside the T, and find yourself hoping that the light changes soon.
4. At last, you’re almost to Annenberg. Maybe now you can smell breakfast? You take a deep breath, when suddenly you find yourself bent over coughing, with tears streaming down your face. Welcome to the construction site outside the science center, which features a lovely potpourri of burning plastic and toxic chemicals. If you try to breathe through your mouth, you can almost taste it. There’s no other option. Time to run for it.

Harvard is haunted. Or at least, that’s what two separate companies claim in their guided ghost tours of Harvard’s campus.
"All the construction happening around Memorial Hall makes it a very active area," said Sam Baltrusis, founder of Cambridge Haunts—a group that offers nightly ghost tours around campus.
The most recent paranormal sighting, according to Baltrusis, is Holbrook Smith, a College student who fought and died in the Civil War, only to return to campus to finish his exams post-mortem. Also among Harvard's spectral cast of characters is Fanny Appleton Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s wife who died in a mysterious accident and has been spotted around Longfellow House.
Cambridge Historical Tours, the group competing with Baltrusis’s to corner Cambridge's burgeoning ghost tour market, offers treks through Cambridge’s haunted sights every week Thursday through Sunday.
Despite their shared subject matter, the two groups like to think they have little in common.
"Our tour is more the PBS of ghost tours," said Baltrusis. "Theirs is more theatrical."
While Cambridge Historical Tours instructs its employees to dress in period costumes and remain in character as historical figures, guides with Cambridge Haunts lead tours as themselves with no props other than antique-looking lanterns.
"Being in costume allows you to be fully immersed in the story and makes our tours a much more immersive and engaging experience,” said Christopher Schultz, co-founder of Cambridge Historical Tours. "It gives a wink and a nod to the audience that we're here to have fun and we're here to play."
Luckily for both groups, the demand may be great enough to sustain two haunted tours of Harvard Square.
Schultz said he estimated that close to 800 people have taken ghost tours with Cambridge Historical Tours and that he has presold 1,200 tickets for the upcoming weeks. Two thousand people have gone on Cambridge Haunts ghost tours thus far, according to Baltrusis.
Baltrusis, a journalist who recently published "Ghosts of Boston: Haunts of the Hub" and is in the process of writing a sequel about Harvard's paranormal activity, said he thought ghost lore is too often treated as mere myth.
"I wanted to debunk the misinformation," he said. "My tour is a history lesson with ghost stories."
Schultz said that although Cambridge Historical Tours also strives for historical accuracy, its goal is to entertain.
"Do I believe in the supernatural aspects?” he said. "I think they make a good story."

In this series, Flyby asks Harvard students to weigh in on topics worth polling.
The Harvard Institute of Politics recently surveyed young voters and found that supporters of President Barack H. Obama are less enthusiastic about the president this election than they were four years ago. Only 55 percent of Obama supporters polled by the IOP said they "definitely" planned to vote next month. Are these statistics true on the Harvard campus? Flyby walked around the Yard and asked Harvard students if their enthusiasm for Obama has waned.
Out of 15 sudents polled by Flyby, only three reported that they were equally enthusiastic about Obama this year as they were in 2008.
Most students agreed that their excitement had waned as a result of disappointment with the president's performance and the economic crisis looming over the current campaign.
For Terilyn S. Chen '16, this difference is visible in her peers. "I remember in 9th grade everyone wore Obama pins, and his motto of change was so strong. I don't see that as much now."
The IOP survey also reported a noticeable decrease in young people's excitement over politics in general, which Harvard students polled by Flyby students said they understood.
Matthew C. Seghers '16 said he finds it discouraging when candidates don't answer questions in debates and instead attack each other.
"I'm less enthusiastic about Obama, and I'm less into politics," said Eloise M. Wheeler '16. "I'm disappointed."

Tired? Me too. If midterm season has you trapped in a cycle of stress and sleep deprivation, you are not alone. But this exhaustion could be hurting more than our happiness/wardrobe choices/social life. It turns out that our performance on the very tests, papers, and projects for which we keep ourselves awake will suffer as well. According to a study presented by neurology professor Clifford B. Saper at the Society of Neuroscience's annual meeting in New Orleans last week, losing sleep impairs our alertness and empathy, two cognitive abilities crucial to performing well on exams. Don't fret though, Dr. Saper has some sage advice on how to manipulate your sleep schedule to best serve your intellectual needs.
Learn, sleep, repeat: Learn the material in advance and then sleep on it—sleep builds memory, so if you pull an all-nighter before the test, you probably won't recall those lecture slides you're frantically trying to memorize. Get the requisite seven to eight hours of sleep the night before too, to optimize alertness on the test.
"Trying to stay up late and cram for a test is probably the very worst thing you could do," Saper said.
Early to bed, early to rise: For the inevitable late night studying you'll be doing the night before a midterm, it is better to get to sleep at a reasonable hour and wake up early than to stay up for that extra hour.
"Go to bed at midnight and do your hour of studying at 7 a.m.," Saper said. "It makes more sense to do it then, rather than between midnight and 1 a.m."
Biorhythmic gymnastics: Try to get on a sleeping pattern that has you waking up around test time every day for a week or so in advance so that your biological clock can acclimate to the test day schedule for optimal academic performance.
"Whatever you make a habit of doing your body will adjust to," Saper said.
Toto, we're not in kindergarten anymore: No more naps! And no more studying or movies in bed. Dr. Saper says to not do anything in your bed besides get a good night's sleep.
"Little tricks like that help in making you associate your bed with sleep," he said.
If all of this sounds like a tall order to you, we're on the same page. Even if you find it hard to work these tips into your routine, be sure to keep them in mind as you approach your next tests and deadlines!

Early Friday morning a sprinkler malfunction at Widener Library caused damage to approximately 400 books, according to an email obtained by The Crimson and confirmed by a spokesperson for the Harvard Library.
The Cambridge Fire Department responded to the malfunction, which occurred in the third floor elevator lobby of the east stacks. The elevator was closed throughout the day on Friday and water damage was visible on multiple floors. Response teams removed the books to be dried and restored.
Widener—the flagship library in the Harvard Library system—is home to more than three million volumes.
Library officials could not be reached for comment over the weekend.
