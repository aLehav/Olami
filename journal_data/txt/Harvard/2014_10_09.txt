After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I sing of arms and a man,” begins Virgil’s “Aeneid,” an epic poem chronicling Aeneas’s journey to found Rome. In a student-written, contemporary reimagining of this story, however, the man in question is not Aeneas.
Jules (Jacob D. Rienstra ’17), a modern-day version of Aeneas’s son, Ascanius, takes center stage in Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “With Fates Driving,” an original play by Alona Bach ’16. The production will run from Oct. 9 to 11 at the Loeb Experimental Theater.
“Ascanius really stands out as the anomaly; there’s no real background on him,” director Sean K. Hardy ’16 says. “We’ve had to create this entire character around him.”
Although Jules does interact with ancient Roman goddesses, he speaks and acts as an individual firmly rooted in the modern world. “[These words] are words you’ve said to people before, you know, whether you’re breaking up with someone or talking to a parent,” Hardy says. “It’s very much language you can identify with.”
Transitioning between the classical and contemporary components of the play happened organically, Bach says.  “I was writing a scene where Creusa was visiting Ascanius in a dream, and all of a sudden—I think I must have been writing pretty late at night or something— she was like, ‘I brought you hot chocolate.’ And I was like, ‘That’s a weird thing that just happened.’”
The play grapples with the tensions between agency and predestination. “We’re trying to figure out who’s really running the show. Is it fate? Is it destiny that’s pushing this stuff to happen? Or is it something else?” producer and active Crimson editor Joule P. Voelz ’17 says.
In an effort to highlight a variety of art forms, the play also features an original score composed by Eric R. Corcoran ’16 and movement designed by Julia K. Cataldo ’15. In addition, the Classics Department will be hosting a discussion about the historical and literary traditions surrounding the “Aeneid” at Oct.10 show.
“This is going kind of to be an unprecedented celebration of the arts and theater,” producer Madi L. Taylor ’16 says. “We’re bringing all of these elements together in a really amazing and new way that I think people are going to love.”

As Harvard students, we may find it easy to fit the same mold we did in high school, or last year, or two years ago—to stick to the stale shape that got us here and became a benchmark for our success. It is simpler to cling to last year’s accomplishments and dreams, dwelling in the past, than to create new ones to reflect on in the future. But as this Rosh Hashanah taught me, and as any time of reflection and restoration without religion can teach, we don’t have to live according to what’s behind us. Instead, we ought to focus on what’s ahead.
I wake up on Rosh Hashanah, and the emergence of the New Year hits me much like all the days before. After another night of four hours of sleep and two alarm-snoozes, I get out of bed to cram for my Chinese quiz and think drowsily of the readings I need to catch up on.
On my way out the door, I check my phone on a whim and find an email response from my Chinese professor, telling me that I am free to miss today’s quiz and attend temple services instead.
Cursing under my breath to bemoan the hours I have spent studying and knowing I am already an hour late for synagogue, I throw on a dress. I write a to-do list for the day on my way to Memorial Church and promise myself that I will leave services at noon, an hour early, to prepare myself for section later today.
I open the door to the rabbi’s voice. “There are times for work, and there are times for rest. Today is a time for reflection and release.” I find an empty pew and put my phone on silent, but I keep it in my hand.
I watch friends embrace around me, and I wonder if my parents are also at temple. I let my mind unclench and sing the songs of my childhood with people whom I do not know. Together, we stand and listen as the ram’s horn bellows in the New Year; we are told that the 30 notes it cries are meant to sound like tears.
It is 12:05. I place my phone against the wood behind me and settle into my seat as a woman—whom I cannot see from my spot behind a pillar—takes her place before us to speak.
Because I am tired and I cannot see our sermonizer, I close my eyes as she tells her story. On this day four years ago, as a freshman in Canaday E, she learned of her grandmother’s death. After trying for days to write something about her grandmother’s long life as it came to a close, she realized that she knew only bits and pieces of her grandmother’s experiences—nothing about who she was at her core. She could relay their shopping outings in detail but nothing about what her grandmother believed, or how she loved, or why. And soon it was too late.
Our speaker then recounts a famous Rosh Hashanah passage about how on this day, God is said to write the fates of all those in the book of life for the coming year: who will live, and who will die, who by fire, and who by water. She first notes the strangeness of God dwelling on our finitude, but then poses the question: “We have such trouble imagining the infinite. Don’t you think the infinite had trouble imagining us?”
This musing may seem non-secular in context. But there’s more to it than just the religious. I consider my last year unfathomably small, in the scheme of the infinite, but powerful in the context of my annually evolving story.
Rosh Hashanah is a day of repentance, or teshuvah, which literally means “turning”—towards the coming year and a better self, away from last year’s transgressions. After the speaker returns to her seat, the rabbi reminds us to not be discouraged if our list of things to improve resembles last year’s. We are imperfect beings, and we continue to look forward. We can leave or take beliefs and traits from our past, but we cannot bring the past to our new year.
Though the High Holy Days have now ended, this sentiment should last longer than two fall weeks. As we ease into the year, the moment has come to find new things that define what we believe, and how we love, and why. The moment has come to try a new class in a wacky and fascinating discipline, to forgive an estranged friend, to transform our past selves into who we have become.
It’s time to turn forward.

It is not uncommon for me to hear a fellow Christian claim that being against someone’s queer identity has no correlation with how the Christian loves that person. Although the intention to love and spread the word of God is there, in my experience hearing such a claim has only meant one thing: that you are against me as a person.
Having gone to a Catholic high school, I have had to sit through the classes where the teachers taught that “homosexuality is a sin,” but at the same time, that “we as Christians must love our gay brothers and sisters.” Love the sinner but not the sin, right?
When pushing back against this, I have heard countless times from others, “It’s like an alcoholic: We stand against the alcoholism, but stand in solidarity and in love with the alcoholic.” Baffled, I usually stop fighting and respectfully leave the conversation at that point. And it’s not because the other person said the game-winning statement: it’s because I am troubled to hear my Christian brothers and sisters relate something that is a beautiful aspect of me to a disease.
Alcoholism is a very serious and horrible disease, and I agree that we must love all those who are fighting such a devastating predicament. But to claim that my sexual orientation, since it does not conform to an ancient biblical and patriarchal “duty,” is a disease implies that homosexuality damages the homosexual, and I could not disagree more.
Let us work under the assumption that in order to fulfill the word and love of God, we as Christians must follow decrees found in the Old Testament, which is where 99 percent of anti-homosexuality rhetoric is located. If we must comply with the same law against homosexuality, then we must, by following logic, comply with the other laws in Leviticus. Must we, as Christians, refrain from eating shellfish, since this is considered a sin in the Old Testament? Are we forbidden from certain types of clothes because of the material it is made from? Are we going to be eternally damned if we refuse to cut the foreskin of a newborn male? Frankly, I would say that most, if not the majority of Christians would reply that complying with those biblical decrees would be silly in today’s society. Then why isn’t it the same thing with homosexuality?
Jesus, our Savior and Lord, never mentioned anything on homosexuality, but rather that we, as children of God, must love each other unconditionally. It is true that St. Paul mentioned that homosexuality is a sin in his letters. But he also mentioned that women should be subordinate to men, in and outside of the Church. However, I hope that many Christians would agree that we are not going to Hell if we campaign for equal and equitable rights for women.
I could continue about how the Biblical justifications against homosexuality align with other decrees that we would consider ridiculous or violation of human rights in today’s world. But that’s not the point.
The point is that LGBTQ people, no matter how much people believe otherwise, are still a discriminated minority in the country (and world). LGBTQ youth have a much higher suicide and homelessness rate in relation to their straight peers. Many states this past year tried to pass laws to protect “religious freedom,” which would have allowed property owners to deny services, including hospital care, to LGBTQ people. LGBTQ people, particularly more “effeminate” gay men or “butch” gay women, are portrayed negatively and ridiculed in the media. And to escape this world of hate and pain, my fellow queer Christians and I turn to the Church as sanctuary of love, and yet even there we are told that we must conform and cleanse ourselves of something so complex, so beautiful, so special.
I am even more troubled to hear my heterosexual brothers and sisters claim that as a community, we can force someone to change their sexuality. If you would like a better reference on this, either read or watch “Prayers for Bobby,” the story of a Christian mom who tried to guide her son away from his “sin” and who ended up committing suicide. What’s the mother doing now? She is one of the most prominent LGBTQ activists in the United States, and to this day she is sickened by ever believing that she could equate her son’s sexuality with sins.
But what really breaks my heart is to hear my straight brothers and sisters use “I have gay friends, brothers, family members, etc” as a justification for being against homosexuality but not the homosexual. Having a gay friend does not mean one is able to defend homophobia or the belief that being gay is a sin. It does not work this way. To tokenize your gay friends in order to defend hateful and hypocritical beliefs is not a representation of love. Jesus dined with the outcasts and did not judge the outcasts. Why are we not doing the same?
Jesus told his brothers and sisters, “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.” One day I hope to find the love of my life. One day I hope to settle down and start a family. One day, I would like to be content with everything that I have accomplished and watch my family blossom. Our Christian communities encourage these hopes for heterosexuals, but for us queer Christians, we are discouraged and shamed.
God has created a beautiful planet with humans and animals diverse and unique in their own ways. God has given me my strengths and weaknesses, my achievements and shortcomings, my light and my dark sides. But I refuse, my fellow Christians, to believe that God has given the self-righteous duty to my heterosexual peers to condemn something that I still thank God for giving me every day. So, my straight brothers and sisters, you heard our Lord Jesus: Who’s going to be the first to throw that stone?

UPDATED: October 9, 2014, at 11:56 a.m.
I can vividly remember the slew of questions that everyone asks each other during Opening Days: “Where are you from? What’s your main extracurricular activity? What were your SATs and AP scores?” The last question stood out to me the most. Here I was, at Harvard, and it seemed as though within our first weeks together, we were trying establish the merit of our own place here and where we all ranked relative to one another.
According to Harvard professor Steven Pinker’s article, “The Trouble With Harvard,” the SAT should be the sole determinant of who belongs at Harvard and who does not. Specifically, Pinker states that standardized testing is the “magic measuring stick,” and that if used as the sole basis for admissions, will enable Harvard and other prestigious American universities to produce the best possible graduates and eliminate the growing zombie-like state of students and the anti-intellectualism that exists on campuses.
While I agree we should try to fix the problems Pinker highlights, I fundamentally disagree with Pinker’s argument that standardized-test based admissions is the way to do so. First, in no way does the SAT or any other standardized test measure curiosity, passion, or a desire to learn.  Pinker laments that he “faces a lecture hall that is half-empty” and that students do not take enough advantage of the fact that Harvard is “an institution that is single-mindedly and expensively dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.” Intelligence, or at least the kind that Pinker believes belongs at Harvard, is not the trait that inspires students to go to class or use these resources; the desire to learn is. The SAT and the AP do not measure that willingness or the willingness to ask hard questions of people like Pinker. They actually show the opposite skill: the ability to find an answer when there is definitively one to be found.
Similarly, the way that Pinker appears to dismiss athletics, music, and similar activities suggests that he might not recently have had many conversations with students about the experiences that shape their lives. Having played sports throughout high school, I learned more from them about how to problem solve, how to work in a team, how to persevere, and how to pursue a goal than I did from any test. I imagine that many of my peers would say their experience playing an instrument, singing in a chorus, or being apart of student government taught them similar lessons. The skills I mentioned above are what enable people learn from a bad grade and to teach people to communicate with people who have different opinions, two vital parts of an intellectual community. Maybe the students Professor Pinker dreams are behind those 2400s automatically possess these skills. I think that is a dangerous assumption, though.
Despite the criticisms I have offered so far, the difference in Professor Pinker’s and my viewpoints ultimately rests in how we define excellence and intelligence. If I understand his point of view, he views them both as concrete, objectively obtainable ideals that are based solely upon quantifiable and standardized academic results. However, I believe there are different ways to define them.
Howard Gardner, also a Harvard professor, argues in his theory of Multiple Intelligences that students “possess different kinds of minds and therefore, learn, remember, perform, and understand in different ways.” Gardner suggests that intelligence and excellence can take all different forms, and I applaud the Harvard admissions committee for recognizing this reality. A student who has attended schools with limited resources but has still found a way to thrive intellectually (even if the student does not get a 2400) has exhibited the ability to make the best of the opportunities afforded to him or her, a skill that is vital to succeeding at Harvard and in life. This student, to me, is excellent. A student who has the ability to sit down for 3.5 hours and think through a set of questions to find the correct answer each time is also excellent, just like the athlete who can run fast, jump high, and put the team’s needs above his or her own is. Above all, the student who can educate his or her peers with a different viewpoint articulated in a kind and clear fashion, challenge his professors with pointed and thoughtful questions, and think carefully and curiously about the world around him is excellent and intelligent. If Professor Pinker can find a test that measures all the forms of excellence and intelligence I have mentioned, then I am fully supportive of the admissions process being only testing-based.
In the meantime, I hope that we can all care a little less about our scores on tests of any kind. They in no way define our intelligence, our worth, or who we are. Ironically, I believe if we do the opposite of what Pinker prescribes and care less about statistics alone and stop defining ourselves in terms of them, we have a better chance of achieving the type of thoughtful, intellectual community that Pinker would like to see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eliot’s House Committee recently came under fire for refusing to submit an appropriately detailed committee budget under the new bylaws established by the Harvard Undergraduate Council last semester. The Eliot House Committee eventually compromised with the UC, and released a budget that shows higher revenues and expenditures than any of the other houses—approximately $122 spent per student.
Although the Eliot House Committee has a much larger annual budget than any of the other houses, this does not appear to be based on any inherently problematic practices. Ticket sales are the greatest source of revenue for the Eliot House Committee, so in essence Eliot students are getting back money that they have put in. As long as each house receives equal amounts in grants from the UC and the College administration, there does not seem to be a problem.
Despite small hurdles this first implementation, the UC’s decision to encourage financial transparency in the House Committees is a positive step. It will allow college students to hold House Committees accountable for spending and budgeting. Additionally, increased transparency should foster greater communication between House Committees and allow the individual Committees to learn from one another.
This semester marks the first time the UC published House Committee budgets under the new initiative. As such, this is an appropriate time to reflect on improvements that the UC could make to the budgetary disclosure system. Given the Council’s goal of increasing fiscal accountability, an appropriate first step would be to create a standardized format for House Committee budgets. Such a template would make information more easily accessible to students and House Committee members alike. Currently, the separate House Committee budgets follow no consistent format: some give budget details for only one semester; others for the entire year. Others appear to give the budget in Euros. Given that the UC initiated the publication of House Committee budgets, the UC should take steps to create an intuitive template for publishing budget information.
That said, the Eliot House Committee is right to question the UC’s jurisdiction in effectively auditing each House Committee’s entire budget—including how they budget funds that are not provided by UC grants. The consequences—the loss of House Committee funds for one year—are significant enough to warrant attention. In the current system, we see a difficult split between two separate by important governing bodies: the UC and the House Committees. Both contain students who are elected to represent their House peers. Based on the recent confrontation between Eliot House Committee and the UC, however, it is clear that the two groups work for different ends.
Properly and officially delineating the respective roles of the House Committees and the UC would be an important first step toward improving relationships with these two important governing bodies. Having these two groups work in tandem would advance the quality of student life at the College.

Alcohol usually accompanies bad decisions; running a half marathon, as we see it, qualifies as a bad decision. A sweaty, painful, 13.1094 mile-long bad decision. Instead of case racing the entire way and polishing off a light (and hydrating) beer at each mile marker, why not make at least one good decision? Follow FM’s advice on what to drink before, during, and after a half-marathon.
Before: Coach’s Pick-leback
1.5 oz. Whiskey
1.5 oz. Pickle Juice
1.5 oz. Competitive “Spirit”
Make sure to get a good night’s sleep and eat plenty of carbs—tomato basil ravioli soup with extra ravioli should do just fine. Stretch and hydrate for good measure. Throw back that shot of whiskey for the courage it’s going to take you to fight through those 13 miles, and a shot of pickle juice to fight through the charley horse that’s bound to hit at mile eight.
During: Road Runner’s Rage
4.5 oz. Red Bull
1.5 oz. vodka
Pinch of Sugar
1.5 oz. Water
1.5 oz. Bad Decision
 To keep you going through the five-mile slump, forget water cups. A refreshing Red Bull vodka will give you the real energy you need. Don’t be fooled by its high caffeine and sugar content; the crash will come long after the race is over. After all, you’re only running half a marathon. Even DAPA would approve: the extra shot of water says, “Don’t forget to alternate!”  At this point, who knows if it’s the Red Bull or the calisthenics that have your heart beating like that.
After: Runner’s High
3 oz. Absinthe
9 oz. Champagne
A dash of lemon
A teaspoon of Hemingway-esque machismo
Served in a trophy, this twist on the classic Death in the Afternoon will make up for the endorphins that never kicked in at mile 11. The absinthe will raise your delusions of grandeur to a hallucinatory reality. Congrats on finishing your half-marathon. We raise you a cup half full to a race half done.

Pistol firings, pet monkeys, British prisoners of the Revolutionary War, Theodore Roosevelt’s childhood crib, bawdy wall-cartoons, ghosts, and a bookshelf of bathroom reading. No, these aren’t elements of a surrealist painting; they’re all bits of the storied past of Apthorp House, Adams House Master’s residence. Tucked away in Randolph Courtyard, removed from the chaos of Cambridge, Apthorp House is one of the city’s oldest surviving houses. FM was granted an exclusive tour from the current Housemasters of Adams, Judith “Judy” S. Palfrey ’67 and John “Sean” G. Palfrey VI  ’67. Come with us as we check out the Palfreys’ crib (literally).
A Brief History of Apthorp
After being greeted by Sean Palfrey at the front door, I was led into a bright, cozy library. The walls—lined with shelves that are crammed with books and knick-knacks, and paintings from the Fogg—lend the library an understated grandeur. A bout of “dense laryngitis” had reduced Sean Palfrey’s voice to a kind of reverent whisper, which seemed somehow fitting for an  overview of the history of Apthorp House.
Rev. East Apthorp built the house in 1760. Apthorp’s tastes, far from modest, offended the Calvinist sensibilities of Cambridge at the time, and by 1764 he was charting a course back to England. During the Revolutionary War, the house was used as a barracks, and served as headquarters to General Israel Putnam during the planning for the Battle of Bunker Hill. Later in the war, Apthorp House housed British prisoners, including Gen. John Burgoyne, who routinely griped about what an unpleasant place it was.
After the Revolutionary War ended, the house bounced around from private owner to private owner, until it became a boarding house for wealthy students—part of the Gold Coast—in 1900. Its tenure as a boarding house is one of the most colorful aspects of its history. From pistol practice and playing football in the hallways, to pet monkeys that swung from chandeliers, the boarders of the Gold Coast put modern day frat houses to shame with their Gilded Age antics.
When the school started the House system in 1930, Apthorp became part of the new Adams House, and, after a few renovations, was made the House Master’s residence.
First Floor
The first floor abounds with open space and light. “This floor is really a public home for the students in Adams House,” says Sean Palfrey. “We want them to see it as that; the fire’s warm, and we just try to make it warm and welcoming all the time.”
Just outside the library, a miniature figurine of General Burgoyne hangs in the hallway, encased in a tiny jail made by Sean Palfrey. We’re next given a peek at the first floor bathroom, furnished with photographs taken by Sean Palfrey himself.
Next up is a necessary anomaly: the sleek, modern kitchen. Five refrigerators and six ovens provide food for events in Apthorp that can draw as many as 300 people.
The last stop is the dining room, decked out with even more art from the Fogg. A working fireplace (a rarity at Harvard) lies near a sketch of colonial revelers.
Second Floor
The walk to the second floor offers a testament to Rev. Apthorp’s penchant for both American colonial design and European opulence. The central staircase (a mainstay of American colonial architecture) leads up to a second floor with abnormally high ceilings (a European luxury).
The second floor is the personal residence of the Palfreys and their family. Although we didn’t spend much time on this floor, Judy Palfrey did highlight a glowing example of Rev. Apthorp’s extravagance: “He had closets full of closets. There’s literally a room [on the second floor] that had five closets in it.”
Third Floor
Although Adams house is known as FDR’s former home, Sean Palfrey brought a connection with another Roosevelt to Adams House when he began his tenure. Sean Palfrey is Theodore Roosevelt’s great-grandson, and consequently owns the crib that Teddy slept in as a baby. The crib sits inside the third floor “Roosevelt Room,” a guest room dedicated to all things Teddy. Posters of Teddy Roosevelt adorn the walls around the crib, and the low ceilings (only around 6’ 4’’ high) make for a tight fit for certain students visiting the room.
Fourth Floor
The fourth floor has been largely untouched since Apthorp transitioned to being the House Master’s residence in 1930. Drawings by Gold Coast inhabitants still festoon the walls: monkeys, scantily clad women, and men in suits are among the graffiti etched upon the walls.
The fourth floor also serves as the cat’s refuge from the ghost. That’s right, evidently Apthorp has a ghost. “Our cat has seen one,” says Judy Palfrey.“She comes up here when it spooks her out.” Though legend has it that the ghost is the soul of Gen. John Burgoyne, the Palfreys are skeptical. “He didn’t die here,” says Judy Palfrey. “But there is a ghost, so maybe it was one of his men.”
Though the fourth floor is rather barren now, the Palfreys hope that a student might be able to change that. “A project we would love to do at some point is renovate this to be the way it was when the students were here. The idea is one side would be when the revolutionary soldiers were here, and the other side would be when the students were here,” says Sean Palfrey. “[We’re] looking for a student of history or design or architecture to do a thesis on restoring this to what it might’ve been like. Spend all the time they want to, here, and study the history and help us figure out how this place would’ve been furnished.”
The Palfreys were central in the completion of a similar Adams restoration: that of FDR’s former room in Adams B-17. “We’ve really restored [the FDR suite] with as close to a historic replica [as possible] of what it was when he was here,” says Sean Palfrey.
Preservation and Accessibility
Indeed, one of the central goals of the Palfreys’ tenure has been the historic preservation of Adams House. “It’s an extraordinary house, it has so much history and so many cool nooks and crannies,” says Sean Palfrey. “You want the students to experience every corner of it.”
When the Palfreys moved in and the house underwent renovations, they were adamant that it be kept as original as possible. “The one thing I asked when we renovated this place was: ‘make sure we don’t fall through the floor, but aside from that, leave it the way it is, because it’s very cool looking,’” says Sean Palfrey. “We mostly wanted it to be historically—not accurate, exactly, but at least possible. We wanted it to be real. Harvard would’ve made it Danish Modern if we’d asked them to, but we didn’t want that.”
The changes that were implemented during the renovation had to do with making Apthorp more accessible and open to all students. Wheelchair accessibility to Apthorp, while not ideal, is far better than it once was. Additionally, the Palfreys have made an effort to decorate in a way that accommodates the background of any student. “We sort of wanted to make this feel, for anybody from anywhere in the world, sort of comfortable,” says Sean Palfrey. “So we’ve got things from China, Africa, South America, Native American artifacts.”
Before we leave, we take one final look at a photograph on the wall of the first floor bathroom. A multiple exposure, the photo was an image of the library as it exists now, open and bright. Overlaid atop the library is the sketch from the dining room of colonial revelers, come back from the past to bask in Apthorp’s renewed and continued splendor.

We got a tip that the nut guy at the farmer's market was hot. So we had to see for ourselves.  Mostly, we imagine, people ask him, "What's the price of your nuts?" We rose above and asked the serious questions. We even (reluctantly) rejected the free samples. 
Hometown: Bethlehem, Penn.
Ideal Date: Eating excellent Asian cuisine.
What you look for in a girl/guy: Bright eyes and a sense of humor.
Where to find you on a Saturday night: Reading at home or roasting nuts.
Your best pickup line: “Have I ever sold you nuts?”
Best or worst lie you’ve ever told: I told my father I was accepted into UPenn.
Something you’ve always wanted to tell someone: Joe Biden makes me happy.
Favorite childhood activity: Catching amphibians.
Favorite nut: Almond.
Favorite farmer’s market stand other than your own: Soluna’s Herbal Garden.
Describe yourself in three words: Eccentric, happy, vibrant.
In 15 minutes you are: Pretty much the same as right now.
In 15 years: I’ll still have my health and optimism.
Best story: I have random encounters with customers in the Boston area. They yell "Hey nutguy!" or "He’s got great nuts." Generally I tell these folks to call me "Nutsy."

Brewery tours condense the two most essential—but opposing—aspects of the collegiate experience into one hour: learning and drinking. It’s a simple tradeoff. Endure a lecture on yeast strains and hops growing, and then down three free beers and stumble into the night. Or morning. Tours run from 10 a.m., Monday through Saturday.
The tour is brisk, our guide chipper. We taste roasted barley, and are subjected to a series of very low-stakes pop quizzes. (“What does water do to beer?” “That’s right, folks, it makes it a liquid!”) The guide passes around cupfuls of hops and instructs us to sift it through our fingers, which leaves my hands feeling (and smelling) like the floor of the Sigma Chi basement.
We pass a row of Instragramable copper barrels, which hold something called “wort,” a sort of sugar water produced when grain and water are mashed together. Wort is then boiled with hops, and yeast is added, to convert sugars to alcohol and CO2. Well, that’s the gist, anyway. Beer brewing is, I gather, part art, part science, and you certainly won’t learn how to master it from a half-hour free tour.
Still, our guide provides us with a few takeaway facts we can smugly insert into conversations later in the weekend. For instance, did you know that there are only two types of beer? There are ales and lagers, and they are differentiated by the yeast used in their fermentation. IPAs, stouts, pilseners—those are all just styles.
At last—the main event. We crowd around long tables for the tasting, in a room that is aggressively brightly lit, perhaps as a reminder that this is not, in fact, a bar. The brewery doesn’t have a full liquor license, so we are limited to three small drinks.
The first beer on the day’s agenda is Boston Lager, the staple beer of the Sam Adams roster, brewed year-round and bestselling. Our tour guide runs through a skeletal version of the rubric savvier tasters use to assess beer quality: color, smell, and taste. This is the point at which we are encouraged to shout our qualitative analyses out at the room. “What do you taste?” our guide asks, with the blithe smile of a Gen Ed TF. A few people murmur answers. “Caramel.” “Copper?” “Hops!”
Next we try Sam Adams’s most popular seasonal beer, OctoberFest. It’s darker in color than the Boston Lager, and it sparkles a little more in the mouth, although maybe that’s just the taste of novelty. Third is an experimental beer that has not yet hit shelves: honey lemon ginger sweet pale ale.
My tablemate, a visitor from southern Maine, expresses concern over the clunkiness of the name. Our guide reassures: the marketing geniuses will whip up something catchier, if this concoction ever makes it beyond the brick walls of the brewery. It may not. Despite the luster of its ingredient list (40 lbs of orange blossom honey, 2 lbs of lemon zest, 2 lbs of ginger), the test beer sits heavy on the tongue. It’s a little too medicinal, like a Ricola cough drop left to fester at the bottom of your backpack for a semester.
Our benevolent guide gives us a moment to linger under the fluorescent lights before we are shepherded into a gift shop that doesn’t sell any beer. It does, however, offer belogoed ski jackets and feathered Alpine hats, promoting OctoberFest. If we want to spend cold hard cash and make merry, we’ll have to trek 10 minutes down the road to Doyle’s Cafe. Doyle’s, we’re told, was the first establishment to carry Sam Adams brews, way back in 1984. There, we can indulge to our hearts’ content, and even get a free branded pint glass for our trouble.
GET THERE
Samuel Adams Brewery is located at 30 Germania Street in Boston, a short walk from Stony Brook Station on the Orange Line. Free tours are given all days but Sundays. They run Mondays through Thursdays 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Fridays 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., and Saturdays 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Visitors must be 21 or older to partake in the brew tasting, but root beer is offered as a consolation prize for the underaged.

Harvard’s Department of Visual and Environmental Studies is home to some of the most creative minds in film, fine arts, and environmental studies. FM caught up with two VES faculty members—Dan J. Rowe, a teaching assistant, and Ruth S. Lingford, director of undergraduate studies in the department—to hear about their favorite films.
What is Rowe’s favorite film? The TF cites Jim Henson’s “Labyrinth,” featuring David Bowie, as his all-time favorite. “It’s also my favorite musical and my favorite family movie. It’s the greatest film ever made,” says Rowe. Other favorites include “Grave of the Fireflies,” “Team America: World Police,” and “Barefoot Gen.”
“It’s all first hand nightmare imagery: a child running through the city, hallucinating,” says Rowe of “Barefoot Gen,” a Japanese film chronicling the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a child. “It’s horrifying, but theoretically completely accurate to the events, even though it’s made in a silly seventies cartoon style.”
On a somewhat related note, Rowe remarks that he has a predilection for “stupid superhero movies.” More specifically, he mentions Marvel films including “The Avengers” and “Guardians of the Galaxy.” He clarifies, “Action movies that make me cry a little bit.”
Lingford mentions “My Neighbor Totoro” as a personal favorite. “I think it’s wonderful because all the characters in it are completely sweet and yet it manages not to be kitsch. I think that’s because it creates a narrative about death. The mother is in the hospital, and the daughters are dealing with her illness,” Lingford notes.
Rowe has a few favorite horror films; he cites“Horror Rises from the Tomb,” “Ghost Galleon,” and “House Next to the Cemetery” as the best “bad horror movies.” He explains, “They’re great because they’re sort of spooky bad, but there are also anthropological elements because they’re foreign amalgams, ripoffs of American horror film tropes.” Lingford added the original “Let the Right One In” as a terrific horror film.
When it comes to romantic comedies, Rowe says “The Red Shoes” is his favorite. Lingford also lists “West Side Story” as the best movie musical and “Nymphomaniac” as a model romantic comedy.
“No, that’s a joke,” she clarifies. “There’s no way ‘Nymphomaniac’ would be a romantic comedy.”

“Beyoncé -The Study” is a new Harvard Business School case study that examines the business operations behind the powerful music industry figure. But why stop at the B School? FM thinks every Harvard grad school should incorporate Beyoncé into its curriculum.  
Graduate School of EducationThis study tries to answer the question: “If Beyoncé never graduated from high school, why should I?” As a future educator, this question will be the toughest you will get from your pupils. As of yet, there is no clear answer.
Medical SchoolIn 2004, the word “bootylicious” was added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Since then, demand for butt implants has increased by 4,000 percent. In this class, you will learn how to effectively craft the ideal buttocks for a patient. Medical students will use a plaster cast of Beyoncé’s booty—hand-crafted by the Graduate School of Design—as the model bum. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced StudyIs Beyoncé a feminist? Do you have the right to claim someone is not a feminist if that someone is Beyoncé? Who is the arbitrator of feminism? Is it Emma Watson? Is it Shailene Woodley or is she just that fucking actress from ABC Family’s The Secret Life of the American Teenager? Is it Reina A.E. Gattuso ’15? Probably. By reading only poorly written “think pieces” about Beyoncé, students will examine the online furor surrounding the use of the word feminism.  School of Engineering and Applied SciencesSEAS is running an experiment to measure the effects of a physical confrontation on the velocity and acceleration of an elevator. They are seeking participants, a woman and a man to mock fight, a man to attempt to separate them and a woman to stand in the corner and do nothing.
Divinity SchoolThe Harvard Divinity School, through this case study, will examine the evidence for and against the belief that Beyoncé is a supernatural being as the followers of Bey-ism claim. Included is evidence of the performance of miracles, such as the resurrection of Madonna’s music career, and eyewitness statements from the night she ascended into Heaven from the site of the Superdome. Praised by the Holy Trinity: Beyoncé, Blue Ivy, Beyoncé.  Kennedy School of GovernmentAre you prepared for the coronation of Queen Beyoncé? This class will examine institutional preparedness for the reign of the new leader of the world. How will transnational organizations be affected by the inevitable rise of the supreme? Are they ready for this jelly?

My most recent haircut was in New York City. I went in by myself and ducked into the basement of the huge Astor Place Hairstylist like I was trying to lose a tail. I was ushered to the nearest open hairdresser, where I squeaked onto the red vinyl chair and pulled up a picture on my phone of some celebrity with a below-the-ear bob. All this was done with minimal talking. It felt oddly like committing a crime.
Lucia, the woman with scissors behind me, tied my hair into a ponytail and hacked at the stem, above the tie. I picked at the corners of my fingernails as Lucia chopped away with one ear-bud dangling out of her ear. When my ponytail was freed from my head, she dropped it into my palm and shook her hand to get rid of the strands still clinging to her fingers. Then she laughed and pulled her phone out of her pocket to take a picture of my clump of hair.
The rest of the haircut was like an impersonal hook-up. We didn’t talk. We didn’t touch any more than what was absolutely necessary. I’d never before had a hair-cutting experience in which the hairdresser did not comment on my unique color (red). Never before had a hair specialist declined to joke with me about bottling the color and making a fortune off the sale. This was a new experience. For once, my beautiful hair was just a job.
Fitting, I thought, looking at my hair laying on top of the plastic drape Lucia had tied around my neck. It looked like a dead ferret and it was hard to imagine that the pathetic curl had ever been attached to my skull. I felt a grim satisfaction seeing it disembodied and sad.
I should say that I attach an abnormal amount of significance to my hair. It is red, and my name is Ginger, despite the byline. Ginger is what my friends and family call me and have called me since I was born. I’m unforgettable if only because I’m a caricature.
But I love my hair. I really do. When it was long, it cascaded over my shoulders, and I could flip the part over one ear so that it looked casual and sophisticated in an intelligent way. I love that it gets brighter in the summer, and that people used to compliment me on how silky it looked if I happened to forgo shampoo for three days. It was the kind of hair I could neglect, mess up into a wad at the back of my head, put a clip on one side, and still have people tell me how lucky I was to have beautiful red hair.
With hair as loud as that, imagine its amplification when paired with a name like Ginger. I’ve never had the experience of someone forgetting my name. I complain about the injustice of having people mention “South Park” or “As Told By Ginger” when I introduce myself. I rant about the state of my identity in relation to my hair and how much I hate and love my name. But the truth is I wrote my college essay about my hair. It’s loud and unique and fraught with angst. It’s easy to hide behind something like that.
Haircuts used to mean long evenings spent holding my head steady in my mom’s bathroom as her scissors chopped a severe line just above my shoulders. When she was done she’d puff baby powder onto the back of my neck and pronounce me groomed enough to go to bed. It wasn’t until years later that we went to a professional hair cutter and discovered the extra inch of hair on one side of my head. Who knows how long I’d been walking around uneven. After that I only went to hair stylists. No more sitting on mom’s toilet seat and clenching my eyes shut against the bothersome loose ends.
So here I was with Lucia, who had now moved onto styling the remaining hair on my head. I wish barber shops didn’t have mirrors right in front of customers. My least favorite part of haircuts is looking in the mirror at my face bordered by the straight, dripping curtains of hair. I imagine most people are alarmed by seeing themselves in this state. My face in that mirror looked too big, too pale, too bland. I miss the toilet-seat haircuts, however choppy the result.
I’d like to say that this haircut was a way to redefine myself, that it was some sort of declaration. But that’s not true. I cut it off as an apology, and I guess I’m writing this piece as an apology too.
Hey everyone: I’m sorry for how easy it is to remember my name. I’m sorry that my hair is so loud. I’m sorry it’s so easy to change. I’m sorry that I have an excuse to be angry when anyone laughs at my name. I’m sorry I’ve made people uncomfortable by insisting on using my nickname and not my byline. I don’t know why I do that. I’m sorry that it’s so easy to make a metaphor out of my haircutting experience. I’m sorry I’m still writing about my hair. I will probably always write about my hair.
Lucia cursed behind me and brought her finger to her mouth.
“What happened?” I asked. She showed me her index finger. There was a gash along the side where she’d cut herself. There was blood on her scissors and blood on the cloth pockets tied to her hip.
“I’m sorry,” I said to her, unsure whether I should take off my drape and find her a Band-aid or let her handle the situation herself. She sucked on her finger again and I continued to sit uselessly with my short hair dripping water onto my neck. “I’m sorry.”

Defining “basic” is anything but. While basicness is commonly understood as a binary, close scrutiny—in the form of a weekend on Long Island—has reminded me that this is far from the case. Like electromagnetism and everything in a WGS class, “basic” is a spectrum, and like a proclivity for pumpkin spice, it exists inside all of us. To help make sense of this misunderstood condition (and our desire to pair Juicy with Uggs), FM presents the Basic pH Scale. Similar to the litmus paper from your 8th grade science fair project, the higher you go, the more basic you get. If you have any questions, visit BU.
1—Beyoncé. We’ve accepted that it’s part of the human condition to love Bey, but at the same time, clichés are basic. And so is naming your daughter after a color. 2—Animal Videos. Videos of dogs, hamsters, and other furry mammals scratching themselves may be cute, but do you really need to post them all over your blockmate’s wall? 3—Froyo. Use all the cognitive dissonance in your power, but froyo will never be a healthier version of ice cream. 4—Lamont Café. Like a final club party, nothing good happens after 11 p.m. Ignore the girl with the Kong take out—she’ll thank you later. 5—HBO Go. SWUG dreaming you’re Hannah Horvath? Get in line. 6—The B-School. Need I say more? If you’re confused, go to Park on a Thursday night. You’ll still be confused but not for the same reason.  7—Wine Night. Having four buck chuck in your Winthrop common room doesn’t make you classy. For every Instagram, move yourself up the scale. 8—Pumpkin Spice. Maybe it’s the perfect companion to stepping on crunchy leaves, but every other girl in Uggs has the same thought. 9—Section kid. You don’t really care about Confucius. Otherwise you wouldn’t be in Chinese Philosophy. 10—Farmer’s Market Tuesdays. Either we’re all friends of farmers, or we have our eyes on the same cute nut guy. 11—OCI. No one is surprised to see you shuffling down Mass Ave in a suit. Please don’t expect us to be. 12—Inspirational Quotes. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own (basic) inner voice. 13—Daedalus. A nice atmosphere and pleasant lighting, but too many HKS students trying to relive their twenties makes this a basic haunt.  14—Eliot House. Yes, your budget makes us judge you.

The folks behind LS1A—Harvard’s popular introductory life sciences course—have become known for renaming various ordinary aspects of their class, such as tests (“ICEs”) and homework (“pre-games”). Confused by all these unfamiliar terms? Never fear—we’ve created a handy guide to the LS1A lexicon, and added a few suggestions of our own.
ICE: Stands for “In Class Examination.” Renamed mainly to make second-order rate reactions sound cool and edgy. Also slippery and difficult to grasp, like the course material. ICE Cube: The final exam, so named because it’s three times the length of a regular ICE. Topics tested range from intermolecular forces and membrane potential to the trials of hustlin’ on the streets of Compton, with a possible extra credit question on the lovable family comedy “Are We There Yet?” Pre-game: A homework assignment to be completed before lecture. Helps LS1A students misrepresent weekend activities (e.g: “Dude, what are you up to tonight? / Pre-game? Pre-game? ’Bout to pregame so hard, you don’t even know”). Post-game: An unusually difficult p-set. Often lasts well into the night, ending when you wake up dazed in Cabot the next morning with N-methylacetamide molecules drawn in Sharpie on your face.
Pimpin’: A high honor in LS1A. PIMP stands for “Prepared, Intelligent, Might Pass.” True PIMP status is rare and sought after by many. Those who resort to academic dishonesty are given the dishonorable title of PLAYA (Please Let me Access Your Answers).
The Kong: Late-night lab section with lots of toxic mixtures.
Beer goggles: Another word for lab goggles. With these on, even the most hazardous chemicals appear to be in your league. TFs advise against feeling up materials such as hydrochloric acid when under the influence. You will regret your poor judgment in the morning.
Lab swag: Lab coats. The LS1A team, jealous of CS50’s popular t-shirt line, are hatching plans to reinvent this humble stable as a fashion statement, complete with embroidered Harvard logo. Next step: bedazzled industrial strength rubber gloves.  Basic Bitches: Solutions with a pH greater than seven.
Walk of Shame: The long trek back from pre-ICE office hours at the BioLabs building, usually spent worrying over how screwed you are. Always in closed-toed heels.  Hangover: Life Sciences 1B.

Beer is gross. My editors, it turns out, are also gross, as they have decided to devote an entire issue of our magazine to it. But I am a communist, and thus oriented towards taking one for the team. As an act of protest, however, and because I do not believe in market economies/have $13 in my bank account, I am only reviewing the beer I manage to get for free: at parties, and, in an act of virtuosic mooching, from my roommate’s supply. It’s not pretty, but neither is late capitalism.
Keg
(free; party)
I don’t know what kind of beer is filling this keg, but whatever it is, it tastes like pool water. It’s Saturday night, and two friends and I stand hunched in the hallway of a very full and sweaty party, swishing the weak liquid like mouthwash and muttering into my recorder. The beer tastes like the kind of water that leaves mineral marks on your showerhead, like water you’ve soaked a penny in for a couple weeks, “like dirty water,” my friend says, “but not unpleasantly.” It’s bubbly, in a despondent sort of way, and has the tinny quality of canned tomatoes. At this point in our tasting, someone asks us if we’re in line for the bathroom. We are not.
PBR
(free; party)
On the upside, the can rests securely in my cleavage, which both cools me off and leaves my hands free to gesticulate and reach for the Tostitos. On the downside, it’s Pabst Blue Ribbon. PBR’s mouthfeel is fuzzier than the keg beer’s, more rounded and softer. If the keg beer was “flavorless Pop Rocks,” as my friend claimed, then this is Alka-Seltzer. If the keg beer was making out on a shag rug, this is cuddling with a puppy. A puppy with hops on its breath. The can informs me that “nature’s choicest products” are responsible for PBR’s “prized flavor,” which I doubt, and also that PBR was “selected as America’s beer,” which I believe utterly. Nationalism is a bitter brew.
Flipside Red IPA
($2.00 to my roommate; common room)
Sunday afternoon in my common room, and I’m breaking into my roommate’s beer supply. She takes a sip in order to “refresh [her] memory,” and then stares at me enigmatically as though she has arcane knowledge of this brew’s flavor profile that I will never access. This is the same coy smile I give heterosexual men who ask me what lesbians do in bed (mostly divination), and it is maddening. But even I can tell the difference in quality: Flipside Red IPA is not as gross and coppery as the beers from the night before, and makes my tongue tingle intriguingly. I can even get on board with the “robust tropical fruit and citrus hop flavors” claimed on the label—is that a whiff of coconut? Flipside Red IPA is so alarmingly not disgusting, in fact, I find myself rethinking my orientation: Am I a beer drinker? Do I perhaps see the merit of spending more than a minimum on alcohol? Do I even have a stable identity? This beer has notes of apricot and strong overtones of postmodernity.

It started in the spring semester of 2009 with a bet between House masters: which house could brew the best batch of beer before commencement? It became a Kirkland House fixture. Lead by advisor and Kirkland House tutor Luke Walczewski, the Brew Club is exactly what it sounds like.
Each week at their meetings, the members start a new batch of homebrewed beer. The brewing process itself centers on three main stages; “It’s a week of primary fermentation and a week of secondary fermentation; then, if you’re going to bottle it, it takes another two weeks in the bottles in order to carbonate,” Walczewski explains.
In the first stage, the ingredients are boiled together. “You put in hops, and you put in grain. The whole process from start to finish for the first step of it takes maybe two and a half to three hours by the time you do all the things you need to do,” says Walczewski. “Then, we let it sit and ferment for a week and then the yeast does its magic; it’s turning the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.” In the next stage, secondary fermentation, the sediment that has collected on the bottom is siphoned off; the liquid is transferred to a different vessel, and then it’s left to sit for another week.
At that point, the trickiest stage of the brew process ensues: bottling. The club collects and recycles used bottles, sanitizing them thoroughly with a special solution and transferring the liquid into them. Since the brew is left flat after the initial and secondary stages of fermentation, the bottling process is also the carbonating stage. Walczewski explains that, to get carbonation, “You put a little more sugar in, and then you pour it into bottles and you cap it immediately.” With nowhere to go, the carbon dioxide carbonates the beer and—hey presto—you’ve got bubbles.
As luck would have it, beer brewing is a surprisingly affordable pastime. A starter kit goes for around $70. After that, each batch that the club produces is 5 gallons, or about 50 beers. At 30 dollars a round for supplies, it comes out to somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 cents a bottle—not too shabby for a decent brew.
Most of the ingredients are purchased at Modern Homebrew Emporium, located just west of Davis Square on Mass. Ave. The way Walczewski describes the store, it sounds like a grown-ups’ candy shop: “You go in and it’s basically giant tubs full of different kinds of grains,” he says. “They have, like, thirty different kinds of hops, and all these different strains of yeast.” The individual ingredients may sound less than delectable on their own, but as Walczewski puts it: “You can make all sorts of things.”
This breadth of possibilities is a sentiment that the Brew Club seems to have taken to heart. Some of the beers that the club has concocted in the past sound comfortably familiar—Belgian dubbels and Belgian tripels, ginger beer and holiday cheer ale. A few years ago, when the White House released the recipe for a beer they were brewing on site, the club made White House Honey Ale. Other brews, though, are more outlandish. Cherry chocolate porter. An IPA made with Solano peppers. Blueberry beer. Apricot. Juniper. Walczewski’s personal favorite is their Citra IPA. Brewed with special Citra hops, he refers to it as “kind of our signature beer.”
When asked for brewing advice, Walczewski offers, “Just try it. Don’t be nervous about what can go wrong,” adding, “The worst thing that happens is you make a beer that tastes bad, and you throw it all away. You’re not going to hurt anybody. Just make sure you’re following the law, and you’re 21, but it’s easy and it’s fun, and it’s cheap.”
Since students must be of legal age to participate, there is an almost complete turnover in Brew Club membership each year, but on the bright side, when students do get the opportunity to join, they also get to enjoy the drinks of their labor. “Drinking beer,” as Walczewski explains, “is an integral part of the beer making process.”

When shopping for beer, most of us privilege convenience over value. But on behalf of Harvard Square consumers, FM’s done the research on prices; you can thank us later. What we found is that no store that sells beer has an entirely reliable selection (but if you’re looking for something specific you should probably try C’est Bon); two have sneaky additional fees (if you want to keep it simple, go to Louie’s, where what you see is what you pay); and one is mainly a wine and liquor store (hey, Doma). Here, we compare and contrast by the numbers. (Note that all prices are subject to change.)

With so many academics and researchers around Harvard, eclectic topics are bound to emerge. Here are some of FM’s favorites:
Max D. Price
Department: Anthropology, Ph.D Candidate
Dissertation Topic: Morphological changes in pigs from the 6th to 3rd millennia as a result of domestication
As an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, Max D. Price first became interested in anthropology. When someone suggested that he take a class in zooarchaeology, he took the chance and “it all just clicked.” These days, Price studies how pigs changed morphologically in response to shifts in husbandry practices brought about by sweeping economic changes faced by smallholders over the course of the 6th through 3rd millennia BC. Pigs are especially interesting because they were domesticated twice: once in the Middle East around 7500 B.C and again in China at approximately 6000 B.C. In his research, Price uses fossilized pig teeth to understand their domestication over time. With geometric morphometrics, Price is able to take advantage of mathematized analysis of shape change to infer information about the way pigs were domesticated and treated in the past. “I hope to continue to understand the processes by which humans modify their food resources—that’s the most important question to me,” he told FM.
Anna K. Hopper
Department: Government Dissertation 
Topic: The government role in building and financing airports
When she was a senior at Harvard, Anna K. Hopper ’11 wrote her thesis about political parties in Scotland. After completing her master’s degree at Oxford, Hopper returned to Harvard, initially assuming that she would continue her work in comparative politics. But that was before she took a class at the Harvard Kennedy School on the government’s role in transportation, and another at MIT on the airline industry. “Both of these classes made me really interested and excited. I hadn’t really thought about [airports] as a subject to study before,” Hopper explained. Today her dissertation focuses on the government’s role in building, financing, and operating airports. She says, “If approached from the right angle, I think that it’s something that can connect to political science, but it’s also one that people outside the discipline can find interesting.”
Sarah Wellons
Department: Astronomy
Dissertation topic: Compact ellipticals galaxies in simulations
“Many astronomers have this stereotypical story of when they were eight years old and they fall in love with the stars. But that’s not really how it started for me,” Sarah Wellons says. In fact, she came into the world of astronomy as an undergraduate student at Princeton University, where she read Simon Singh’s “The Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe,” and the subject became an academic passion. At Harvard, Wellons works with a research group that uses computers to create extraordinarily large-scale cosmological simulations and recreate physical systems. In her dissertation, Wellons uses these simulations to examine a population of the galaxies from the red-shift (or early) universe known as “compact ellipticals,” or “red nuggets.” Wellons claims that one of the most exciting aspects about her research is simply light, explaining that, “Almost everything that we know about what lies outside the earth comes from light—photons—and it’s amazing how much information can be carried by light, as well as the ingenuity people have in using it to figure out how the universe works.”

1637: John Harvard moves from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony. He dies later that year, leaving money to New College, which is later renamed for its greatest benefactor. Harvard develops plans to build a brewery on its campus. Legend has it that Harvard learned the art of beer brewing from family friend William Shakespeare. One could say that the College’s on-campus brewery used recipes directly from the “First Folio.”*
1639: The first President of Harvard College, Nathaniel Eaton, leaves campus brewery functions to his wife, who lets supplies dwindle, much to the dissatisfaction of the students. Eaton subsequently loses his job.
1667: Harvard College enforces rules dictating how certain beers are brewed on campus.
1686: Increase Mather is appointed President of Harvard College, and updates College rules to stipulate a specific ratio of gallons of beer to barley malt to ensure the best possible brew for students.
1703: Harvard boasts three breweries on its campus. At Commencement, one barrel of cider is served along with four gallons of beer and 18 gallons of wine.
Late 1700s: As the institution focuses on promoting its academics, Harvard’s breweries fall largely out of function, and most of the beer is relegated to a storehouse.
1814: The last remaining brewery on Harvard’s campus succumbs to a fire.
1860s: 10,000 men of Harvard like to sing, and 10,000 men of Harvard like their beer. Rousing choruses from drinking songs include lyrics such as “For I like a drop o’ good beer,—I does; I’se fond of a drop o’ good beer, —I is,” and “For Sally likes her beer,—her does; Hur’s fond of a drop o’ good beer,—hur is!”
1892: The Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 1892 Christmas Theatricals program lists the lyric, “We cannot recommend the mixture of beer, milk, maple syrup, and ice cream. Even an ostrich would hesitate.”
1917: Harvard’s Adolphus Busch Hall is completed. It is named for its benefactor, who also lent his name to the Anheuser-Busch Company, which today brews Budweiser beer.
January 1934: After over 100 years of dry dining and the end of the Prohibition era, beer is again served in the College dining halls for sudents over 21. In order to drink, students had to produce special blue cards signed by their House masters.
Decemer 1934: Having sold only 27,000 bottles in 10 months, the University discontinues the sale of beer in student dining halls due to lack of interest.
1964: Harvard introduces a bartending course for students. Open twice a month to over 100 students, the final exam consists of students sitting in a circle and creating drinks for the student to their right, until someone passes out. Tightened legislation has since cut this method of evaluation from the course.
1986: Harvard University students Rich Doyle ’82 and Dan Kenary ’82 found the Mass Bay Brewing Company, which today produces Harpoon beer.
2002: Harvard bans kegs at all sporting events, including the annual Harvard-Yale football game, in the hopes of reducing excessive alcohol consumption among spectators.
2004: The Harvard Beer Society is formed by undergraduates to unite beer connoisseurs. Matthew J. Kozlov ’04 successfully petitions the College to create an anthropology course entitled “Intoxicating Agents in Comparative and Historical Perspective.” Harvard University joins a campaign calling for the National College Athletic Association to eliminate alcohol advertisements from its broadcasting.
2007: Harvard implements its amnesty policy, which allows intoxicated students to be admitted to UHS without disciplinary consequences.
2008: Faust and over 100 other university presidents sign a letter to the NCAA, reprimanding its inclusion of 270 seconds of beer commercials during its telecast of the March Madness telecast game. The NCAA guidelines then limited beer commercials to 120 seconds.
2012: Harvard releases new College-wide alcohol policies which standardized how alcohol can be handled everywhere on campus, from dorm rooms to social events.

After struggling endlessly to get off Facebook (animal videos, duh) and finish my overdue Chinese philosophy paper, I want to reward myself. Head fogged by philosophers whose names I can’t pronounce and beliefs I can’t explain (if my PAFees are reading this, this is why you go to class), I seek a prize that can validate my maximum (but probably lower) B+ grade. I’m craving something that can quench the thirst that can only be acquired in Lamont’s stratospheric top floor. I stick my hand into the fridge. What cool and refreshing beverage might I mooch off my roommate?  A PBR? A Natty? Perhaps even a worldly Heineken? To my horror, the bottle that greets me is labeled with a John Boehner resembling jack-o-lantern (obviously in color, but shockingly also in form).  Pumpkin beer. It takes me a second to wrap my head around such a foreign concept. Dutch, perhaps?
Beer is beer, I tell myself, taking a first sip. Toasty notes of nutmeg. Crisp bubbles. A light touch of pumpkin (only slightly less bland and significantly less stringy than the similarly-titled HUDS gnocchi).  It’s not bad on my tongue, but something is off. Where is the relief that normally accompanies the cheap grain? Why are there still beads of sweat on my temples and a lingering sense of anxiety in my chest?  Why am I humming Coldplay?
And that’s when I realize: this beer is not beer.Pumpkin beer isn’t bad per se, but it’s ultimately antithetical to actual beer. We consume beer for liberation—to unwind and to celebrate. Beer transports us to a primal state that values country music and dance floor make outs. Pumpkin “beer,” in contrast, attempts to elevate us to the realm of John Mayer and campfire talk—and that, my dear friend, is not right. As college students, we have an obligation to embrace degradation and the beverage that so allows it. Pumpkin beer will never plunge you into such a regrettable abyss. You’re more likely to enter diabetic shock before you feel the slightest bit tipsy.
We have the rest of our lives to sip on small-batch, hand-brewed, artisan-infused beers. When I’m a 20-something consultant living in Williamsburg, I look forward to learning what terms like “hoppy” and “top fermentation mouthfeel” mean. But until then, you can pass me a Bud Light. Leave the pumpkin in the pies.

Mark J. Mauriello ’15 is getting ready for a Saturday night out. He paints his nails green, sometimes adding silver sparkles to the fourth nail on his left hand.
“It shows that I’m married to glamour,” he says, before covering himself from shoulders to hairline with gold paint. He paints his lips and eyebrows shamrock-green. Then come the lightning bolts, one painted on each cheek. He strips down to put on a tiny silver thong, tights, tearaway gold pants, and a neon fishnet shirt. His hair is already pinned up, fixed into place, and sprayed a fierce green. He covers himself with glitter, dons a special pair of illuminated rabbit ears, as well as lime-rimmed aviator glasses without lenses. He laces up a pair of golden disco roller skates.
Doctor Wheelgood is ready to roll.
It’s a typical Saturday night for Mauriello, one of the stars of Diane Paulus’s “The Donkey Show.” It starts at the American Repertory Theater’s Oberon stage and ends, like Saturday nights at Harvard often do, with a Felipe's run.
“The Donkey Show,” affectionately called “the Donk” by cast members, is one of Mauriello’s many projects.
“For me, every second of every day is theater. I’m always interested in the self that we present, how we dress, how we talk, who we are when we’re being interviewed. I love it all.”
Mauriello has crafted a special concentration in theater arts and performance.  He continues to produce, direct, and perform with the support of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club. He wrote and staged his first original piece, “Julie Cooper: Genesis Prayer,” last year. Mauriello started at the A.R.T. his sophomore fall. Within the past two years, he has been a marketing intern, an understudy, and a performer.
“Theater is always what I’ve wanted,” says Mauriello animatedly, almost knocking over a water glass in the Kirkland dining hall. “It’s always what’s made my brain tick most excitedly. But being here has exploded everything, in a really astounding way.” “The Donkey Show” is Mauriello’s dream college job.“I make new best friends for the night. I wouldn’t want to be doing anything else. This is playtime.”
Playtime starts at 5:30 p.m., when Mauriello arrives at the Oberon to prepare for his transformation into the drug-addled Doctor Wheelgood. The show is set in a disco club adaptation of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” blending drag and the Bard to create a bedazzling 360-degree experience.
Mauriello and much of the cast show up early to hang out and dress (or in many cases, undress) in acid-infused disco outfits and glitter. Preparation can be a lengthy process for Mauriello. “It’s going to be beautiful,” he says in a dressing room backstage. “I feel like I’m on Dance Moms.”
Dancers wearing only neon blue shorts and silver body paint slink by as they prepare for the show. A cast member wearing only butterfly pasties and pink shorts struts into the room, stopping to chat with Mauriello. He springs up, tells a joke, laughs, and paints a lightning bolt on his cheek all at once.
She’s just come down from “the glitter room.” Cast members use a converted bathroom to shower themselves in starry powder before going onstage. A stage manager says the cast has used more than 70 pounds of glitter since the show began five years ago.
The Oberon, a warehouse-cum-theater-cum-club, sits innocuously on the corner of Arrow St., and is the hip, younger sibling of the A.R.T.’s massive Loeb Drama Center on Brattle St. After getting ready, Mauriello rollerblades to the cast’s preshow huddle in the center of the space. Soon after, the disco music starts pulsing and the audience lines up at the door. The pre-show begins, the music keeps blaring, Mauriello and the cast do their thing.
The hallucinatory fluorescence and unique staging of the show take some getting used to, for both the cast and the audience. “The first half of the show, we teach the audience the rules. At some point it clicks, and they just get it,” says Mauriello after the audience has left, in a clear, quick voice. His character, Dr. Wheelgood, is completely mute for the duration of the two-hour spectacle, and Mauriello has been silent since the pre-show. “I can’t speak, but I can vocalize,” notes Mauriello of his character. “The drugs have really messed Dr. Wheelgood up.”
Before anyone can catch their breath, the 7:30 p.m. show is over. “It’s like getting shot out of a cannon. We’re going, going, going, and then the first show’s over,” says Mauriello.
He and the cast have a brief respite between the two shows. They run to the convenient store across the street to refuel, still in makeup. “We look like a gang of freaks making a pilgrimage. The first time I went in, the owner gave me a weird look. Now, it’s normal. No big deal,” says Mauriello. He pays for a juice and candy bar, his face gold and green and glittering.
The cast heads back and relaxes before they must go onstage again. They sit against a wall in between the glitter room, which shares a hallway above the performance space with a traditional Chinese medical practice and clerical offices for the Harvard Book Store. Mauriello’s academic advisor, Harvard Dance Director Jill Johnson, texts him between the 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. performances. “She’s always telling me to sleep, to eat. I need that reminder,” he says, chugging a juice and biting into a candy bar.
As the second show gets underway, the cast’s energy level hasn’t dropped a bit. I hear a sweaty swaying man behind me whisper to his female companion, “The guy in green is fabulous. It’s all fabulous.”
The music keeps running after the second show ends and the cast has left the stage. They return upstairs to shower and de-glitter. The audience keeps dancing, they themselves covered in glitter and smudged with body paint, a condition contracted while gyrating against members of the cast. “They [the Oberon staff] let the audience stay in there for a while. If I’ve met cool people in there, I can go back in and mess with them out of costume,” says Mauriello, grinning and wide-awake even though he’s been at the Oberon for over seven hours.
Mauriello slips out from the performer entrance into the October mist. On the walk back to Kirkland House, we run into roommates Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, Samuel B. Clark ’15, and Andrew D. Talbot ’15. They’ve just come back from a night out, and make plans to go to Felipe’s with Mauriello after he drops his costume off in the room.
Just like that, Mauriello slips back into the now decidedly dull world of Harvard. “It’s amazing,” he says, strolling down Mt. Auburn Street. “I get to spend my Friday nights with my Harvard friends and Saturday night with my Donk friends. Or both.”
The trail of “The Donkey Show,” though, inevitably follows him home.
“There’s glitter in my bed, on our couch, in the shower. Everywhere. Even five days later, I’m still finding it in my hair. And then the next day, I’m back in the glitter at the Donkey Show all over again.”

The Aeronaut Brewing Company occupies part of a scantily marked warehouse complex past some of the leafier residences in Somerville’s Union Square. Between the up-and-coming rock climbing venue Brooklyn Boulders and Harvard Book Store’s warehouse, a chalkboard sign advertising local beer points to a door propped open with an Aeronaut keg. The company’s vast space is filled in with various parts: sky-high ceilings, L-shaped bar, seating areas, and, finally, the enormous metal brewing equipment cordoned off with a modest chain.
The rough-around-the-edges décor emphasizes Aeronaut’s raw feel; there is gray concrete accented with blood orange and teal-colored metal tables and chairs, a huge American flag hanging vertically against one wall, cactuses dangling from chains along another, and surfaces of blond, barrel-like wood. Rock music plays from someone’s iPhone, a bin of Aeronaut t-shirts rests in the corner, and chalkboards display the current varieties on tap. It’s Saturday afternoon, and six or seven customers sit chatting over beers of different sizes and hues.
Last to come into view are the colorful lawn chairs suspended from the ceiling by clusters of balloons, alluding to the company’s hot air balloon logo. This might seem perilous, but the cofounders of Aeronaut have the credentials to back up this feat of engineering: two of the three cofounders have PhDs from MIT.
Ronn Friedlander, who finished his doctoral work just over a month ago, obtained his from the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, where he worked in Harvard’s Aizenberg Biomineralization and Biomimetics Lab. Dan Rassi, who according to Friedlander studied “something with computers” at Cornell, is hard at work this afternoon coding the company’s new website at a table near the bar. Ben Holmes, who met Rassi at Cornell before coming to MIT, breezes in to make an announcement.
The six or seven bartenders clad in various Aeronaut t-shirts and sneakers gather to listen as Holmes explains that the brewery has been nominated by Boston magazine for their list of the city’s best date night spots. He wants to launch a social media campaign involving selfies and the hashtag “Aeromance” in hopes of winning this title.
Holmes, bearded, wearing flannel, and still carrying his backpack, paces around energetically before retreating towards the offices in the back, located in the adjoining Foods Hub, an incubator for local food companies in the second part of the warehouse space. Here Aeronaut currently houses the coffee roaster Barismo, Somerville Chocolate, and Something GUD, a locally sourced food delivery network. Food trucks park out back, but inside, behind the spare stalls of these companies, are rows of long beer-hall tables, a beanbag toss being enjoyed by a group of customers, and the space where the brewery has been hosting musical events on weekend nights.
It’s not unusual to find the three co-founders bustling around the brewery and sharing responsibilities for the company. The three friends, who all look the Somerville graduate student part, have just signed a lease for their fifth year living together nearby. Friedlander, also bearded in a Cambridge University hoodie and jeans, explains that the trio first became interested in brewing as a hobby. At home, they began experimenting with increasingly sophisticated methods and “fancier and fancier equipment.” When one of them found a Craigslist ad for their largest and most expensive barrel system yet, the only way to justify the purchase was by opening up a brewery, and so Aeronaut Brewing Company was born in January 2013.
Aeronaut began brewing beer in its current space  in March and April of this year and opened on the first day of summer, June 21. They have since gathered a substantial following in Somerville, where they have joined the burgeoning local art, music, and food scene, though patrons hail from as far away as Brookline and Jamaica Plain. Some of their more regular customers have gradually been converted into bar staffers, a young, enthusiastic group that participates in the beer crafting and selection processes.
Friedlander leads the sourcing and selection of ingredients and cultivation of wild yeast strains in the Aeronaut lab. Gesturing toward the imposing brewing equipment that fills nearly half the warehouse, he enthusiastically explains the process by which he uses a bioreactor that scales yeast production to accommodate both pilot and full, 500-gallon batches. He sources hops locally whenever possible despite the fact that the majority of American hops originate in the Pacific Northwest. Glancing back at the chalkboards, he mentions with regret that a beer made with only Massachusetts hops had just run out. Their malted grains also often come from nearby, including Four Star Farms in Northfield, Mass. Other farmers pick up used grains for livestock feed.
As for yeast, “you can swab anything,” says Friedlander. “Then, if you have a decent microbiology background, you can separate the yeast from the bacteria.” Aeronaut’s two brewers, one of whom left his career as an analytical chemist in his 50s to attend brew school, work with the team to create unique varieties of beer flavored by the yeast and other ingredients. Recently, Friedlander oversaw the processing of 750 pounds of butternut squash, which they smoked and used for an autumn flavor. With eight lines on tap, Aeronaut has three or four rotating standards, but the selection changes constantly, and only one, the Armadillo, has been continuous.
Current options include a variety of dark and light beers, from stouts to a wine-barrel-aged saison and a Coffee Cacao Blackberry porter that incorporates one ingredient from each of their three member food companies. Friedlander notes that the wheat beers are particularly popular. He hopes to simultaneously satisfy his customers’ preferences and also open them up to new experiences. “I would love to get people to like beers they don’t like or don’t think they like,” he says. However, “even if you’re making the best Berliner Weisse in the country, some people just don’t like Berliner Weisse.” At biweekly staff tastings, Aeronaut staffers choose beers based primarily on season and ingredients. Amassing a variety of commercial beers, they discuss their favorite and least favorite elements as they come up with their own versions and twists.
Once a pilot batch is underway, the brewers continue to tweak it based on hops, malt levels, and aroma. The Berliner Weisse was scaled up in just a week, but most take longer to perfect. So far, they haven’t ever had to throw out a whole batch, although some have proven impractical for scaling up and remained small, like a beer flavored with cherries or a Belgian tripel made with wine must, the pulpy, freshly pressed grape juice used in the early stages of winemaking.
As dedicated beer enthusiasts, the founders have trouble making recommendations because their favorites change every week. Right now they’re most excited about the future of the company. Currently available at Rosebud in Davis Square, Aeronaut beers have made appearances in several other bars and hope to expand steadily. They currently sell almost everything at their own location, which is no problem for them. With big plans for the expansion of the Foods Hub, they hope to eventually create a full-time, immersive consumer retail experience and host seasonal farmers’ market events. Meanwhile, Aeronaut is also increasingly known as a music venue, something its founders did not exactly foresee but are open to. “We always thought we would have cool, local bands,” says Friedlander.
In the meantime, he measures the success of the company by the fact that they have been able to hire four new full-time employees in the past month. For a startup so new, they seem to be rapidly finding their niche in Somerville. With the recent spate of new businesses revitalizing the commercial profile of the area, Friedlander says, “there is every reason to stay here and every reason to add to that.” An Oct. 2 New York Times profile of the neighborhood mentioned Aeronaut, calling Somerville a “hip alternative to both Boston and Cambridge.” Over the course of the afternoon, the taproom fills with customers eager to prove these observers right. Young couples with babies, groups of adults, and even senior citizens gather at tables, crowd the bar, and keep the bartenders bustling.

The first time Nick M. Gavin ’15 tried to brew beer in Pforzheimer House, it didn’t go well.
“Everything went wrong,” Gavin says. “It was four in the morning, I had all this work to do, and I was just screwed.”
By four, Gavin had only finished boiling malt extract with hops, producing a hot substance known as wort. But before he could proceed, he had to cool the mixture to room temperature.
“And so, not thinking, in a delirious, stupid state, I split up the wort into multiple containers so that I could put it into ice baths in separate spots,” Gavin says. “I put maybe a gallon’s worth in my glass fermenter [with the ice bath], not thinking at all… and the hot and cold cracked the glass.”
A good deal of the beer was lost, and the fermenter was ruined.
“It was the worst thing that could possibly happen,” Gavin says. “Ironically enough, that turned out to be one of the best batches I’d ever made.”
Gavin is one of Harvard’s most committed homebrewers. At times of peak production, he’ll turn out a five-gallon batch every one or two weeks—almost every one brewed in a different style.
“I try not to make the same thing twice,” Gavin says. “Even if you’re brewing every weekend and you have a couple batches going at a time, you really can’t make everything.”
When he’s making statements like these, it’s easy to imagine Gavin as the proprietor of a local microbrewery; he’s certainly ambitious enough. But professional brewers don’t have to keep their brewing apparati in dorm rooms, nor do they have to schedule their output around when they have free Saturday afternoons. These logistical problems, give or take a run-in with Harvard administrators, are the main obstacles facing Harvard homebrewers.
Securing the equipment, though, isn’t much of a problem; Davis Square is home to Modern Homebrew Emporium, which Gavin cites as a valuable resource. According to store manager Eamon C. Poplin, Modern Homebrew Emporium frequently sells materials to college students.
During the initial brewing stage, when wort is produced and then combined with yeast, things tend to get messy.
“Basically what you’re doing is taking grains and pulling out sugar from them,” Gavin says. “It involves a lot of siphoning things and moving the liquid around a lot, which means you’re dripping it a lot, which means you’re essentially dripping sugary water all over.”
After this stage, which Gavin says comprises the brunt of the work, the beer will ferment for a couple weeks before undergoing additional bottle conditioning. The beer needs to be kept in a dark place at a certain temperature, which can pose a problem in Harvard dorms.
“There are two types of beer: ales and lagers. Ales ferment at about 70 degrees, which is more or less room temperature,” Gavin says. “But at Harvard, keeping your room at a very consistent temperature isn’t the easiest thing. It’s a lot of holding a thermometer up at various places in your room until you find the right thing.”
Lagers, on the other hand, are fermented at cold temperatures. Gavin considered building a device that would open his window and allow cold air to come in and cool the batch of fermenting beer, but ultimately discarded the idea.
“I have spent a lot of time thinking about this,” Gavin says. “But [it] means I would be keeping part of my room at 50 degrees all year round, which doesn’t really make sense. So basically I don’t make lagers.”
About half of Gavin’s beers are Belgian-style ales, including some modelled after Delirium Tremens, which was named the best beer in the world at the 2008 World Beer Championships. Despite his commitment to quality, he admits that students are often dubious of homebrewed beer.
“The big thing is at first getting someone who hasn’t had my beer before to try it without instantly thinking it’s going to be bad,” Gavin says. “A lot of people will say ‘oh my god, you made this? Did you make this in your bathtub?’”
Gavin admits, however, that his beers aren’t always enjoyed in the way he would like. When the cheap beer ran out at one party thrown by his friends, he begrudgingly offered up some of his beer for one final round of beer pong.
“It was very disappointing,” Gavin says. “When you see it poured out into a solo cup and then downed very quickly, there’s something very sad about that.”
Usually, Gavin will ask his friends to pour the beer into a pint glass so that they can better appreciate its aroma. Given the amount of effort he puts into his brews, it’s easy to see why.
“You find yourself toying with the pH of Cambridge water to match it to where it would be somewhere in Europe,” Gavin says. “It gets pretty nerdy pretty quickly.”
Similarly, Paul M. Banks ’16 says his AP Chemistry course sparked an interest in homebrewing.
“I had a lot of graph paper with me the first time I did this,” Banks says. “Made some sweet phase change charts—you know what I’m talking about?”
Banks, who described himself as a “low caliber beer maker,” takes a more laid-back approach to homebrewing.
“I wouldn’t say I put as much time and effort into it as some more boutique homebrewers do,” Banks says. He likens the more upscale beer drinkers to Comic Book Guy from “The Simpsons”: pretentious, supercilious, and alienating.
“It’s a very exclusive thing these days, very arty, like collecting something,” Banks says. “I don’t like that too much.”
During his time at college, Banks estimates he’s produced about 30 gallons of beer or cider—the latter is “way easier to do.”
“Some batches turn out so poorly that you can only take them to parties and pretend someone else brought them,” Banks says. “Occasionally they’ve been good enough to be the sole focus of an evening.”
Though Banks admits that brewing necessitates lots of advance planning, he doesn’t see the process itself as especially difficult. The biggest obstacle to his homebrewing has been Harvard’s administration. Freshman year, he and a friend tried to brew beer in the Mathews Hall kitchen.
“Obviously, it was very unclear to any of us that alcohol is not permitted anywhere in the freshman dorms,” Banks says.
Armed with ingredients from Homebrew Emporium and a lobster pot from Dickson Brothers, Banks and company started the process on a Sunday afternoon.
“It may not have been the wisest decision on our part,” Banks says.
After taping the instructions to the Mathews kitchen wall, the two began in earnest.
“We had about several gallons of brown liquid with a fermentation cap on it, and someone walked in and asked us what we were doing. [My friend] told this person that we were making bread, which is not the best of excuses for having brown liquid with a fermentation cap,” Banks says.
After the unexpected visitor snapped some photos and departed, Banks’ friend explained that he was a Mathews proctor. The two were forced to pour out the beer, even though, as Banks points out, they had not yet added the yeast.
“That was pretty unfortunate,” Banks says. “But we got back on it the following year. Harvard can’t crush ingenuity.”

The Minerva School, an ambitious education project whose founder Ben Nelson described as “the first elite American university to be launched in a century,” opened to students this fall. With an advisory board that includes former Harvard University president Lawrence H. Summers, the school live-streams immersive seminars to students—capped at 19 per class—for $10,000 a year. Instructional methods are based on cognitive learning research conducted by former Harvard Psychology professor Stephen M. Kosslyn, who joins Minerva as Founding Dean. Students live in San Francisco during their first year, then move together to different cities around the world for each of the following six semesters. FM sat down with the Kennedy School’s Paul E. Peterson, Director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance, who analyzed the Minerva program.
Fifteen Minutes Magazine: Is Minerva accessing a different, underrated portion of the education market by targeting international students?
Paul E. Peterson: Generally, online learning is for those who don’t have access to traditional higher education in the first place, for those on the edges of the academic community. Minerva is trying to go right into the center, which is a very aggressive approach. US education is an export product. Minerva is moving into a market that’s definitely growing.
FM: Minerva purports to be the next leader in higher education, claiming their students develop sharper minds than their Ivy League peers for less than half the price. Is this a threat to existent institutions? 
PEP: It depends on how good the program is. Any school can have high aspirations and a great public relations team, but until they have classes running and testimonials from students, we don’t know what the students’ experiences actually are. Whether the Minerva model is going to compete effectively with the elite universities is definitely a question mark. They don’t have the credentials yet. A degree from Minerva doesn’t have the same value as a degree from Stanford or Yale or Cornell.
FM: How will Harvard respond or change, if at all?
PEP: I don’t see that Minerva’s a compelling alternative to Harvard at this time. Additionally, Harvard has a very substantial discount rate for students from families that are not in the upper 10 percent of the income distribution. But Harvard has also made significant moves into online learning. They have committed funds and personnel and developed solid courses for HarvardX. This may be the most dynamic part of Harvard today. I expect the future is going to provide us with a wide variety of alternative approaches to higher education, not just one model.

Dario Guerrero-Meneses ’15-’16, who came to the United States from Mexico when he was two and a half, recently wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post titled: “I told Harvard I was an undocumented immigrant. They gave me a full scholarship.” FM had the opportunity to chat with Guerrero-Meneses about his story, the article, and the response.
Fifteen Minutes Magazine: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) gave you the chance to get documented. What was it like to be finally getting social security?
DGM: I felt like I was finally being accepted—I finally had a chance to do things the right way as opposed to having to do things without disclosing my status. I’m able to apply for a license, work at Lamont, all thanks to DACA, and leave and reenter the country one time.
FM: Your article has nearly 1,000 comments, some of them quite negative. Do you think you’ve touched a nerve? 
DGM: Yeah, absolutely. The title I gave the article was heavily edited, and the story’s been portrayed in a certain light I didn't intend originally—mainly what’s been lost is the fact that I had to apply to Harvard, that I didn't walk into the office and get an acceptance letter. I absolutely believe that my status as an undocumented immigrant did nothing but help me,  not simply because of the type of American experience I had in not having a social security number. It provided a different view of the United States. It shaped me totally differently. My college essay was about working construction with my dad one day.
FM: What’s it been like to get some negative responses? 
DGM: I derive as much pleasure from the negative ones as from the positive ones. I’m also glad because I’m able to get an idea of why people feel that way. I don’t understand the economics and the politics—I just wanted to say my story.
FM: If you could tell the vitriolic commenters one thing, what would it be?
DGM: Oh, man, can’t be vulgar, right? No if people are going to comment about illegal immigration and Harvard I wish they’d truly inform themselves about Harvard’s admissions policies. Some people said that I should have left, and apply to come back to the United States. You can leave and apply, but most people are never going to be able to come back. For example, my dad had a furniture store in Mexico; my mom had a jewelry store—they got robbed several times; my mom’s father was kidnapped twice; my dad’s father was being extorted by some drug cartel before they left. So that just meant it wasn’t safe to stay in Mexico.
FM: Some of the comments imply that you are a “lawbreaker” and took a spot of a lawful citizen.
DGM: I came when I was two and a half, I mean I had no idea. Some of the comments say I could have made the conscious decision whether I wanted to be in the country or just leave and stay away—I don’t know, that never crossed mind, I guess because I considered it home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three days after Princeton struck down its 10-year-old grade deflation policy, some Harvard professors expressed disappointment with the school’s decision, saying that the policy reversal may discourage future attempts to formally combat grade inflation.
Princeton’s faculty voted Monday to immediately terminate the policy, which, in an attempt to curb rising grades, mandated that no more than 35 percent of grades awarded by each department could fall in the A range, according to The Daily Princetonian.
The vote came two months after an ad hoc committee of faculty members convened by Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber last year called for an end to the controversial grading policy. The committee’s report found that the policy failed to meet one of its initial goals: to maintain “fair and consistent” grading standards across Princeton.
“We have come to feel strongly that departments should spend their time developing clear and meaningful evaluative rubrics for work within their disciplines rather than aligning grades to meet specific numeric targets,” the report reads.
At Harvard, which has been under scrutiny since Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced at a faculty meeting last December that the median grade awarded at the College is an A-, some professors said they felt disheartened that Princeton rescinded its policy.
“I feel dismay and disgust,” said Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53, who asked the question that prompted Harris’s announcement at the meeting last year. “Princeton seems to have given into faculty unrest and a kind of lack of ambition and a failure to maintain academic standards.”
History Department Chair Daniel L. Smail said that while he believes formal grading policies can be problematic and endanger the autonomy of instructors, he was disappointed by the Princeton vote.
“Speaking as a professor and not as a department chair, I was hoping it might work,” he said. “Grade inflation is a problem for all of us.”
Similarly, Economics professor Jeffrey A. Miron said that the policy’s reversal was “unfortunate,” though he added that he was not surprised.
“I thought [the policy] put Princeton in a tough position because some students concerned about their grades would tend to choose other schools over Princeton,” he said. “Unless other schools followed suit, it was a competitive mistake.”
The fate of Princeton’s attempt to address grade inflation, in turn, may shape the way Harvard approaches grading.
Mansfield said that Princeton’s policy reversal might discourage Harvard from adopting a similar policy or taking administrative action to regulate grading practices.
“It’s upsetting that a place like Princeton that made such a good start should now withdraw from it,” he said, adding that “if somebody brought it up again...the answer would be ‘well Princeton tried it but it fell through.’”
Philosophy professor Edward J. Hall argued that after Princeton “took bold steps” with its grading policy, Harvard may be less likely to adopt “heavy-handed,” rules-based regulations to address grading.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta discussed the possibilities and challenges in expanding medical marijuana at the Institute of Politics on Wednesday.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Harvard Medical School associate professor Staci A. Gruber, comes just two days after the Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital announced a “landmark new program” examining medical marijuana. The program will “explore the potential impact of medical marijuana on cognition, brain structure and function,” according to the announcement, and was funded by a $500,000 gift from best-selling crime writer Patricia Cornwell.
Gupta started off the conversation by discussing his “about-face,” referring to the well-known 2013 CNN column in which he apologized for misrepresenting marijuana to the American public.
“I realized that I had in my own way probably dismissed many patients as malingers who were just trying to get stoned,” Gupta said. “And there are a lot of those people. But there are also a lot of very, very legitimate patients as well for whom not only I realized that medical marijuana was working for them, it was working for them when nothing else had.”
He discussed how he afterwards looked at the evidence and found a “very distorted picture” of marijuana in the medical world, with a disproportionate number of studies “designed to find harm.” Gupta highlighted the stigma around supporting medical marijuana as a major challenge limiting scientific research on the topic.
Gruber then shared a clip from Gupta’s documentary “Weed,” highlighting the story of Charlotte Figi, a five-year-old suffering from severe epilepsy. Charlotte and her family had tried several toxic anti-epileptic drugs—but none of them worked, and Figi was still having around 300 seizures a week.
Medical marijuana was ultimately the solution to Figi’s condition, and, as Gupta emphasized, Figi’s story is “emblematic of [the story] of hundreds of families.”
Families like Figi’s, he pointed out, are “medical marijuana refugees”: they can now gain access to medical marijuana in Colorado but can lose their children and be put in prison for drug trafficking if they attempt to leave the state.
“I think it’s interesting to see how his viewpoint changed,” Zarin I. Rahman ’18 said. “Maybe we all need to be exposed to these families that he was, to maybe change our mind on this as well.”
Gupta repeated throughout the evening that the “policy has outpaced the science.” The states, he said, are moving forward without waiting for the science, and the issue is only compounded by the fact that the “policies and the laws we have in [the US] make it challenging for the science to get done.”
The important thing to do at this point in the legalization process, Gupta concluded, is to let marijuana, like any other medicine, “stand on its [own] merit scientifically.” When more scientific studies have been conducted, he said, when that “takes away some of the stigma surrounding this [issue], we can more easily get to the point where we can establish the thresholds” for marijuana use.

In the face of criticism for what some students called insufficient communication in the wake of Friday’s emailed death threat, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said College administrators “can do better” to communicate with students and took full responsibility for their response to the threat.
“If there was a lack of communication, that’s my responsibility,” Khurana said in an interview Wednesday afternoon.
Just over an hour later, he sent an email to undergraduates reiterating that administrators could improve their communication with students during “such situations.” The message was his first to the full student body since hundreds of Harvard affiliates received an emailed death threat last Friday afternoon. The death threat included a racial slur and disproportionately targeted women of Asian descent.
Harvard University Police Department issued community advisory messages to affiliates on Friday afternoon and evening, as well as the next morning, detailing the threat and associated investigation.
College administrators did not email the full student body until Saturday, when Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde forwarded a message from cultural group organizers about the cancellation of a pan-Asian discussion event originally planned for that afternoon. On Tuesday, Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College’s assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion, emailed undergraduates to invite them to a discussion event later that day about the threat.
Khurana, however, did not communicate with the entire student body until the email Wednesday.
At the discussion event Tuesday, attended by dela Peña and Lassonde but not Khurana, several students suggested that the College’s outreach to students following the threat was untimely and inadequate. In particular, students called for administrators to condemn the threat’s racist undertones. They also requested that Khurana himself, as the College’s top administrator, issue a communication addressing the threat.
In both his College-wide email and the interview with The Crimson, Khurana called the threat “despicable.”
“These despicable emails, which directly targeted our Asian and Asian-American students, created an environment of anxiety and fear across our campus,” Khurana wrote in the email.
In the interview, Khurana added that the incident over the weekend demonstrated that he should better communicate his office’s leadership structure. Each dean, he said, should be understood to be speaking for the entire College.
“I haven’t done a good enough job highlighting that their presence is no different than my presence,” he said.
HUPD’s investigation into the source of the threat remains ongoing, although spokesperson Steven G. Catalano issued an advisory message Wednesday confirming that the emails originated overseas and “do not pose a credible threat to the campus at the present time.”
Khurana will host a discussion event on the threat and associated communications on Friday at 3 p.m. at Phillips Brooks House. He had originally planned a discussion on extracurricular activities for that time, but changed the topic in the wake of the threat, he said.

A Moroccan national will be sentenced after being recorded discussing flying a radio-controlled plane fitted with explosives into Harvard and a federal building, according to the Connecticut Post.
Twenty-seven-year-old El Mehdi Semlali Fathi was arrested in April after the FBI recorded him allegedly discussing the attack and training he received in Afghanistan. He later pleaded guilty to perjury for claiming political refugee status to a U.S. Immigration judge.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Krishna Patel is urging Chief U.S. District Judge Janet C. Hall to impose a five-year prison term on Fathi, the maximum sentence for perjury.
Patel said the investigation revealed that Fathi discussed planning a bomb attack within months of receiving refugee status.
Public defender Paul Thomas, Fathi’s lawyer, has argued for a prison term of 15 to 21 months.

A campaign for smaller sections started by teaching fellows at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences garnered the endorsement of the English Department, which on Tuesday voted unanimously in favor of a motion to limit section sizes to 12 students.
The endorsement is the latest support received by the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a movement of graduate students committed to improving the educational experience of undergraduates in part by urging the University to adopt a 12-student cap on section and lab group sizes. The Campaign’s cause has been endorsed by the Philosophy, History, and Sociology departments, as well as the Undergraduate Council and the Graduate Student Council.
The English Department’s endorsement cited four benefits of smaller section sizes: more inclusive and interactive discussions, better pedagogical training for teaching fellows, more teaching opportunities for graduate students, and higher-quality teaching by better prepared teaching fellows.
English Department Chair W. James Simpson said that members of the department swiftly reached a consensus with little discussion.
“When you consider the matter as a teacher, then the arguments all go in one direction,” Simpson said.
Simpson said that financial concerns would be the only reason not to adopt a section size cap and that these concerns are not the “primary responsibility” of faculty members.
According to Simpson, smaller sections are especially important for the humanities division due to the nature of the exchange that takes place during sections.
“In the sciences, a lot of sections are about the transmission of information…. Instruction in the humanities is transactional; it’s an event that happens between text and people and between people,” Simpson said. “For that happening to take place, it’s got to be a kind of theatrical event with the right number of participants.”
Though the Campaign’s past outreach activities have largely been targeted at faculty members, campaign members have recently ramped up efforts to garner support from the undergraduate population.
Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a History teaching fellow who is leading the campaign’s outreach effort to undergraduates, said their goal is to build an undergraduate organization working to support the campaign.
According to Groeger, the campaign does not aim to reduce the number of students taught by each teaching fellow, but rather to reduce the size of each section.
“A common question we get is: will [reducing section sizes] create a shortage of TFs? It wouldn’t, because a TF would be teaching three sections of 12 instead of two sections of 18, and the ratio wouldn’t be changed,” she said.
Stephen Squibb, an English teaching fellow, said the larger vision of the campaign is about “realigning Harvard’s institutional priorities towards the undergraduate educational experience.”
“I think section sizes should be smaller because it emphasizes the fact that this institution takes the educational experience of undergraduates seriously, and that it prioritizes that as much as a new building or any other initiative that soaks up so much of the money that this place has,” Squibb said.

While students active in the queer community said that they welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision Monday to let lower court judgments allowing gay marriage stand, some said that they worried that the issue of same-sex marriage overshadows other concerns of the BGLTQ community.
The Court on Monday upheld appeals court rulings that struck down gay marriage bans in five states—Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Because the decision let rulings from three federal appeals courts stand, experts believe that same-sex marriage will be legalized in the near future in six additional states that fall under the jurisdiction of those three courts.
Even though the Court chose not to hear the cases and hand down what many believe would have been a more definitive judgment on same-sex marriage, students said that they were unsurprised by the Court’s decision and believed it would have positive effects on the movement to legalize gay marriage.
Ariel C. Churchill ’15, coordinator of the Queer Resource Center, said that she was pleased with the decision, as marriage equality remains a pertinent issue for many, including members of her own family.
Churchill is from West Virginia, which is in the same circuit as Virginia and is expected to soon allow gay marriage.
“My grandparents, who are women, who have been together for 30 odd years—this is going to impact them in pretty concrete ways,” Churchill said. “[Marriage equality] is a concrete thing that we can win…. It’s really become a concern for the older generation in the LGBT community.”
Yet Jordan T. Weiers ’16, political co-chair of the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, said that he views the decision as a “double-edged sword.” Although the ruling has sparked national conversations that may not have otherwise taken place, it may also divert attention from other problems faced by the queer community, he said.
“I am concerned that the Supreme Court decision provides the public and people among the gay community a false sense of progress,” Weiers said.
Neimy K. Escobar ’15, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and former co-chair of the QSA, agreed with Weiers.
“[Marriage equality] isn’t necessarily going to do anything for me, as someone who is also marginalized in other ways, apart from being just queer,” she said.
Escobar also said that if the Court had chosen to hear the case and issue a national judgment, resources currently used to campaign for marriage equality could instead be funneled into efforts to address other issues in and outside of the queer community.
Harvard Law School professor Michael J. Klarman said that he was surprised that the Court opted to uphold the lower court rulings rather than hear the case. He added that public support for same-sex marriage has been on the rise in recent years.
“The future seems pretty clearly inevitable, in that [public] opinion is going to move in the direction of gay marriage even if the Court doesn’t intervene,” Klarman said.

Three student groups advocating for changes to Harvard’s handling of sexual assault cases joined together to start a petition on Wednesday urging the University to adopt a policy of affirmative consent, which would require partners to actively communicate their willingness to participate in sexual activity.
The petition launches only a few months after Harvard instituted a new, University-wide sexual harassment policy that some students have continued to criticized despite its implementation.
“We are members of the Harvard community committed to creating a safer and more equitable university, free from violence and discrimination, in which all students are treated with dignity and respect. We are concerned that Harvard’s new sexual harassment policy falls short of supporting this aim by omitting a critical element: affirmative consent,” the group wrote in an online statement Wednesday introducing their petition. “Silence—the absence of a ‘no’—does not mean ‘yes,’ and our university policy should explicitly recognize that.”
One of the three groups behind the petition is Our Harvard Can Do Better, a group of undergraduate activists that last semester filed a federal complaint that spurred the U.S. Department of Education’s ongoing investigation into the College’s adherence to Title IX.
“As the university continues to evaluate its policy in light of an ongoing investigation by the Department of Education, we call on Harvard to adopt an affirmative consent policy,” the statement reads.
The other two groups involved—the Graduate Students Advocating for Gender Equality, or GradSAGE, and Harvard Students Demand Respect—represent graduate students.
This summer, Harvard unveiled a dramatic restructuring of its policy and procedures for handling cases of sexual harassment, including sexual assault. A Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee is currently working to adapt the University-wide policy to FAS. Some student leaders have already criticized the new policy for not including an explicit affirmative consent clause, which is now the required standard for state-funded colleges in California under a recently approved law.
Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX officer, defended the policy at an open meeting in September and argued that it “gets us to the same place” as the affirmative consent policies of other colleges. “The absence of a ‘no’ does not mean a ‘yes’” under Harvard’s policy, she said at the time.
Still, some student activists have argued that the policy’s definition of sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” is insufficiently clear.
“We thought [the petition] would be a good way to show both the FAS [committee] and other offices in the University that students do support affirmative consent, they do know what it means, and that that’s something that they feel is a crucial piece that needs to be added to Harvard’s sexual assault policy,” said Jessica R. Fournier ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better.
The groups’ statement does not specify how long the petition will remain live online.

Norwegian business magnate Christen Sveaas has donated $11 million to the Kennedy School of Government to found the Kistefos African Public Service Graduate Fellowship Fund. The gift will cover tuition, fees, and living expenses for admitted students beginning next fall.
Forming part of the school’s $500 million capital campaign, Sveaas’s donation stands as one of the largest publicly announced gifts to HKS this academic year. The School's campaign has reached at least $355 million, HKS Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 said.
Sveaas is the founder and executive chairman of the Norwegian investment firm Kistefos AS. He has served as a member of the Kennedy School’s Dean’s Council since 2003. In 2006, he provided $1.2 million to HKS to sponsor a fellowship for students from Norway.
In a press release Wednesday, Sveaas emphasized future African politicians’ role in strengthening democracy as motivation for his gift.
“It doesn’t always seem that democracies work as they should, and I hope my small contribution can help educate the next generation of African leaders,” Sveaas said.
Ellwood added that Sveaas’s donation will help reduce the cost of education for international students that come to HKS from Africa.
“We are deeply grateful to Mr. Sveaas for his generosity and excited to welcome the first Kistefos African Public Service Fellows,” Ellwood said. “A fellowship like this one is extremely effective in encouraging the best emerging leaders to apply to and attend the Kennedy School.”

Teach For America co-CEO Matthew Kramer ’98 defended his organization on Wednesday, arguing that accusations by Harvard student protesters that TFA’s teachers are unprepared and its corporate backing is unjust are misguided.
Kramer’s remarks came in response to a Student Labor Action Movement protest on Sept. 26 in which a dozen group members delivered a letter to University President Drew G. Faust imploring Harvard to cut ties with TFA, a nation-wide program that recruits college graduates to teach in low-income communities, if it did not enact certain changes by Oct. 8.
That effort is part of a larger national movement started by United Students Against Sweatshops criticizing TFA for allegedly undermining the quality of public education. Student activists are demanding the program make three changes: only send teachers to areas in which there is a teaching shortage, provide corps members more education and training, and cut ties with corporations the students deem socially unjust, like Exxon Mobil and JP Morgan Chase.
In a phone interview on Wednesday afternoon, Kramer responded to these concerns, saying it was “disappointing” that Harvard students were calling for the University to cut ties with TFA.
“That this group would get involved in asking President Faust to kick us off campus is essentially deciding that they don’t think other Harvard students should be able to learn about Teach For America and the field of education,” Kramer, a former Crimson Business Manager, said. “I think that’s against the core values of Harvard to cut off access to information.”
Specifically, Kramer argued that though TFA teachers only receive five weeks of intensive training before they enter the classroom, the organization invests in extensive supportive coaching during the two years corps members serve. Kramer also cited efforts TFA is making to increase teacher preparedness, such as a pilot program that allows college juniors who have been accepted into the program early to take educational classes in their senior year.
Addressing concerns about corporate support, Kramer said that TFA relies on corporate donations only in order to strengthen programs.
“We wouldn’t take money from an organization if [we] thought by taking money we would cause anything bad to happen,” Kramer said. “If people give us money to do our work, then we think the right thing to do is to do our work the very best we can.”
Though Harvard has appeared to take no action to address SLAM’s demands, SLAM pledges to amp up its campaign. On Wednesday, SLAM and USAS members wrote a letter back to Kramer, as well as TFA’s co-CEO Elisa Villanueva Beard and founder Wendy Kopp, standing by its accusations and requesting a national meeting with TFA leadership within the next month.
The letter makes the claim that there is no longer a national teaching shortage, which TFA was originally created to fill, and implored TFA to stop sending corps members to communities that do not have teaching shortages. The letter also alleges that TFA inflated statistics about how many of its alumni work in education or low-income communities when their service is up.
Kramer, for his part, argues that talent shortages continue to exist in every low-income neighborhood in America and that TFA only sends teachers where they are requested.
“Everywhere in the country principals say, it is hard to find great people who want to teach in my school with my kids,” Kramer said. “Having access to more people who want to do that is absolutely critical.”
SLAM also plans to hold a “Teach For America Truth Tour” event on Friday featuring a panel of TFA and Harvard alumni to discuss the future of the program and American education. Last year, 29 graduates of the College joined TFA, according to TFA recruiter Tess Nicholson.

American public schools rely on a funding system that is rife with inequalities, experts said during a panel at the Graduate School of Education on Thursday.
“Our goal is easy to articulate and hard to get there. It is to make sure every child in this country has access to world-class education. Race, socioeconomic status, zip code, and neighborhood shouldn’t matter,” said forum moderator Susan E. Eaton, research director at the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School, quoting U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan '86.
The event was part of the Askwith Forum, a series of public lectures held at the Ed School. At Wednesday’s event, Bruce D. Baker, a professor at Rutgers University Graduate School of Education, presented the findings of his report “Is School Funding Fair? A National Report Card.”
“Many people think the high spending states are just the wealthiest states, but the effort of the state is important as well. Over the last five years, most states reduced their effort, even though their gross state products have been flat, the percentage spent on school has in fact declined,” Baker said, referring to graphs that showed that state aid per pupil have plummeted or flattened in most states.
According to Baker, generously funded school districts often have more teachers, smaller classroom sizes, and better salaries than their poorer counterparts, factors that experts say can improve student performance.
During the a panel discussion that followed, David G. Sciarra, executive director of the Education Law Center, criticized federal policies on education funding.
“The federal government is complicit in allowing states to get away with [inequity], and it facilitates funding inadequacy in the states,” Sciarra said. “This is at the heart of...why it’s been so difficult [for our nation] to get any real progress, particularly when we’re talking about [disadvantaged children].”
Andres A. Alonso, an Ed School professor and former CEO of Baltimore City Public Schools, said it is important to address several sensitive issues in conversations about school funding.
“What we ultimately need to address is that: this is about race, about class, and about the extraordinary task of shifting the political environment,” Alonso said. “In this magnificent country of ours we have such difficulty talking about class.”
Audience members said they found the discussion meaningful and educational.
“It’s amazing that we were able to substantively talk about policy at three different levels: state, federal, and local, and cover a breadth of issues,” said Todd W. Dalrymple, a graduate student at the Ed School.

Following last weekend’s ups and downs after beating archrival Yale but falling to Brown, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (8-4, 1-2 Ivy) looks to steady its course and bolster its chances of taking the Ivy League championship as it travels to New York to take on Cornell (3-10, 0-3) and Columbia (6-6, 2-1).
“The one really fun thing about the Ivies is that it’s pretty even,” Cornell coach Melissa Batie-Smoose said. “Any given week, the number one team gets beat by two teams it hasn’t lost to in a while.”
On Friday and Saturday, the Crimson will face off against two conference opponents in Ithaca and New York City. Harvard looks to rebound from a loss against Brown (6-9, 1-2) in straight sets on Saturday, and improve its record in the Ancient Eight standings.
Sophomore setter Corinne Bain and co-captain Caroline Walters led the Crimson in Saturday’s conference battle against Brown in the Malkin Athletic Center. Bain had 10 kills, six digs, and 17 assists in her sixth straight double-double.  Walters also contributed with 10 kills and three blocks.
“Last weekend was pretty disappointing,” co-captain Kristen Casey said. “Obviously beating Yale was a big deal on Friday, but we were disappointed about the loss to Brown on Saturday. We’re really working on trying to make sure that we play as well against Yale [as we do] against all of our opponents.”
Cornell will try to snap a five-game losing streak and earn its first Ivy League win. In Saturday’s loss to Penn, senior libero Natasha Rowland led the team on defense with 23 digs, making her sixth place all-time on the university’s career dig list. Sophomore setter Alyssa Phelps and rookies Chelsea Sincox and Emily Wenhoff also notched double digit digs.
“We haven’t had one Ivy [game] at home,” Batie-Smoose said. “It’s really nice for a young team to be home and play in front of their home crowd.”
Columbia is also looking to bounce back from a close defeat on the road against Princeton on Saturday night. Freshman outside hitter Anja Malesevic and junior outside hitter Bailey Springer had 12 kills apiece, and sophomore setter Jennifer Petrovich joined the Lions 1,000-plus assist club after having 35 assists.
The Big Red has a comfortable lead in the history of the series, but the Crimson has won the last four matchups, including a win in straight sets on Cornell’s senior night last year. This year, Cornell will try to put last year’s home loss behind them and add another win to their series against the Crimson.
The team will travel from Ithaca to New York City on Saturday to take on Columbia. The teams have split the season series during 2012 and 2013.
Junior outside hitter Bailey Springer led the team in kills with nine in last year’s 3-0 loss in the Malkin Athletic Center. She has led the Lions on offense thus far in the team’s 2014 campaign, registering 121 kills. The third-year player has also been a force on defense, notching 63 kills.
“Columbia is a defensive team and a good serving,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We will disrupt their game plan with an aggressive attack and scrappy defense.”
Walters and junior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace led the Crimson in the home win against the Lions last year with 11 and 10, respectively. Bain led the team in assists with 19, followed by junior stter Hannah Schmidt’s 18.
The Crimson looks to reverse its luck on the road as of late. The squad was 4-6 on the road in the 2013 season, and opened up conference play this season with a loss against Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The offensive unit that took the field for Harvard in the nation’s capital Saturday looked remarkably different from the one that started the preseason.
Not making the trip to last week’s Georgetown contest were starters quarterback Conner Hempel, running back Paul Stanton, wide receiver Ricky Zorn, and tight end Ty Hamblin.
Hempel suffered a back injury during the team’s first drive in the season opener against Holy Cross. The senior came back after halftime to lead the squad to a comeback victory against the Crusaders but has been sidelined since, ceding the starting position to junior play-caller Scott Hosch. Hosch has led the Crimson to back-to-back victories over Ivy rival Brown and Georgetown.
The junior quarterback will take the reins for at least one more week, as Harvard coach Tim Murphy confirmed that Hempel was still recovering from the early injury and would not be back for Saturday’s contest against Cornell.
The Crimson offense was already depleted entering the season, with Stanton missing from the lineup against Holy Cross. The junior tailback had a high ankle sprain during a preseason scrimmage, and though he returned to rush for 120 yards in the Brown game, aggravated his injury then and did not make the trip to Georgetown.
“Seeing everyone out there, not being able to play, it’s definitely hard to see that,” Stanton said. “But, you know, the team’s doing a great job without me. [Senior fullback] Andrew Casten’s really stepped up his game, so I’m happy to see that, and I’m just ready to play the rest of the season.”
With Stanton out, Casten has had a breakout season early on, rushing for three touchdowns against the Crusaders and finding the end zone four times at Georgetown. Casten, the team’s go-to back in the red zone, will likely only have to shoulder the majority of the rushing burden for another week, though, as Murphy is hopeful that both Stanton and Hempel will return for the Lafayette game, a week after Cornell.
Also notably missing from the offensive lineup are Hamblin, who was to be the most experienced tight end following the graduation of Cam Brate ’14 and Tyler Ott ’14, and fifth-year receiver Zorn, who tore his hamstring in the preseason. Hamblin has yet to appear in a game, and appears to be out indefinitely with a preseason injury, while Zorn’s recovery is “slow,” according to Murphy.
But if there’s a silver lining in the slew of injuries, it’s the Crimson’s relatively light schedule early on that has the squad facing nonconference and weaker Ivy opponents. Harvard’s real test will come near the end of the season, when the team faces Ivy powerhouses Princeton and Yale.
“The long term challenge is to beat the very best teams in our league,” Murphy said. “It would be great to have those guys, because they are among the very top players in the Ivy League. But at the end of the day, you’re going to have years like that and you’re just going to fight through the adversity. You have to adapt, you have to adjust, and that’s the way we’re looking at it, is we’re not counting on those guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most of Wednesday night’s game at Soldiers Field it looked as though the Harvard women’s soccer team was going to do exactly what it did last year on October 8—tie Boston University. But it was not to be. Sophomore forward Erica Kosienski kicked a shot over the outstretched hands of Crimson senior goalkeeper Bethany Kanten in the 105th minute to lift the Terriers (7-3-3, 2-0-2 Patriot) to a 2-1 victory over Harvard (6-3-2, 1-0-1 Ivy).
Kanten, playing her first game in goal this season after recovering from an injury, made eleven saves to keep the Crimson in the game.
“Bethany killed it,” junior defender Alika Keene said. “She absolutely went all in, nothing left behind. She crushed it today.”
BU has been a thorn in Harvard’s side in recent years, having eliminated the Crimson from the 2011 and 2013 NCAA Tournaments. Harvard has not defeated the Terriers since 2007.
BU controlled the game in the first half. The Terriers applied continuous pressure on the Crimson’s defense, generating 11 shots, eight of them on goal.  However, Kanten was able to save all eight shots. She made several acrobatic saves including a stop on a breakaway by BU senior forward Taylor Krebs in the 24th minute, to keep the game scoreless.
“That first half was unbelievable,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “She hasn’t played in goal in forever and what a performance she gave. I’m really proud of her.”
During the first half, Leone made several substitutions to utilize the Crimson’s depth, especially on defense. Toward the end of the first half, having fresh legs in the game paid off. Harvard gained possession of the ball on the Terriers’ side of midfield and set up a corner kick for junior midfielder Haley Washburn.
After a handful of consecutive shots off the corner, freshman defender Mia Bladin scored her first goal of the season to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead in the 43rd minute. This was Harvard’s first goal in three games with the team coming off two scoreless ties against UMass and Yale.
“It was a good goal and we created more chances but we obviously have to do better,” Leone said. “One goal isn’t enough.”
A scary moment came for the Crimson right before halftime when Kosienski barreled into Kanten, drawing a foul. But Kanten bounced back up after the collision and continued to look sharp throughout the rest of the game.
Early in the second half, both teams battled for possession. But BU scored the equalizer on the team’s ninth shot of the game. Junior forward Jenna Fisher connected on a cross from junior back Lauren MacClellan, firing the ball over Kanten’s outstretched arm in the 52nd minute.
With the game locked in a tie, sophomore forward Midge Purce provided a spark off the bench for the Crimson, generating many chances with her speed and ball control. But Purce and the rest of the Harvard offense could not find the back of the net, despite taking seven shots in the half.
In the first overtime, Kanten made four key saves to keep the Crimson locked in a tie. In the 93rd minute, it looked like the Terriers might break through with a flurry of three consecutive shots. After saving the first two shots, Kanten was out of the net when BU’s senior midfielder Jamie Turchi fired off a shot. But Turchi missed wide and Harvard forced the game into double overtime.
As the Crimson battled through its third consecutive double-overtime game and fourth of the season, it appeared as though Harvard had enough to hold on for the draw.
The Terriers’ only shot of the second overtime was Kosienski’s decider. Despite the loss, the improvement on offense and the reemergence of Kanten were positive takeaways from the Crimson’s final nonconference game of the regular season.
“Everyone was throwing their bodies out there,” Keene said. “We were just going a hundred and ten percent. Going into the next game, we’re just going to remember this, remember the feeling that we felt when we were knocking the ball around and finally getting our flow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, Jeff Bridich’00 and tricaptain of the 2000 baseball team was named the third general manager in Colorado Rockies’ team history. The move came after Dan O’Dowd, the team’s general manager since 1999, and Bill Geivett, the team’s senior vice president, resigned following Colorado’s disappointing 2014 campaign.
Bridich, initially a junior varsity outfielder who would go on to play catcher and outfielder for the Crimson baseball team during his junior and senior years, worked as an intern in MLB Commissioner Bud Selig’s office following graduation and has worked for the Rockies since December of 2004.
He had served as the team’s senior director of baseball operations and senior director of player development prior to his promotion to GM and senior VP. Bridich, whose wife Sarah graduated Harvard the same year he did, inherits a roster with more talent than their fourth-place NL West finish would indicate. The Rockies were a game above .500 entering June before injuries derailed the remainder of their season, extending their playoff drought to five years.
Perennial MVP candidate Troy Tulowitzki missed 71 games due to injury while starting corner outfielders Michael Cuddyer and Carlos Gonzalez missed a combined 205. Colorado also possesses the third pick in this year’s draft and a deep farm system that was ranked tenth best in the majors by Baseball Prospectus before the 2014 season.
Bridich, who grew up in Milwaukee and now lives in Denver with Sarah and their two children, joins two other MLB general managers with Crimson ties. Rick Hahn of the Chicago White Sox and Sandy Alderson of the New York Mets both graduated from Harvard Law School—Hahn in 1975 and Alderson the following year.
At 37 years old, Bridich joins an elite and growing group of MLB general managers under 40. Alex Anthopoulos of the Toronto Blue Jays, Jon Daniels of the Texas Rangers, and A.J. Preller of the San Diego Padres also have yet to celebrate their fortieth birthdays. While Bridich’s ascent to general manager was quick by baseball standards, the Rockies hope their ascent to the postseason under his leadership will be much quicker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Keith Wright ’12 last competed in the United States, he led the Harvard men’s basketball team to its first NCAA Tournament since 1946. Now, one NBA summer league squad, two overseas teams, and almost three years later, Wright is returning to compete in the NBA Development League.
The 6’8”, 240-pound forward will be available in the November D-League Draft.
Wright served as a two-year co-captain for the Crimson. In his junior season, the Norfolk, Va. native led Harvard with 14.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game and earned Ivy League Player of the Year honors in 2010-11. He was also named to the Lou Henson All-America team, made up by the top Division I mid-major players in the country.
Wright was a key part of the transformation of the Harvard men’s basketball program. Though the Crimson had not achieved a winning season since 2002 when Wright arrived in Cambridge in 2008, Wright helped lead the team to three consecutive 20-plus-win records. His college career cumulated in the 2012 Ivy League Championship and a March Madness appearance.
“A lot of people still have my Harvard career in their mind,” Wright said in an interview with DLeagueDigest.com. “I feel like I was a good player at Harvard, but there is so much more to my game now.”
For the past two seasons, Wright has played for a Swedish and a Polish team. In Sweden, Wright earned the Basketligen Center of the Year Honors, averaging 14.2 points and 8.8 rebounds per game to lead his team to the league semifinals.
Wright’s newly-developed skills include an effective pick-and-roll game. He will also seek to showcase a variety of post moves and his ability on the offensive glass.
Following graduation, Wright entered the 2012 NBA Draft but was not selected. He was, however, given a spot on the Dallas Mavericks’ summer league squad.
Wright will look to capitalize on the D-League’s newfound prominence as the NBA’s official minor league organization. In recent years, the D-League has helped launch a number of successful NBA careers, including that of Wright’s former Harvard teammate, Jeremy Lin.
“I want to make a push at my ultimate goal, really any basketball player’s ultimate goal, to play in the NBA,” Wright said. “I feel it will allow a lot of eyes to be on me this upcoming season.”

Do you have three days to spend in the kitchen preparing a pastry? Probably not, but if you do, the recipe for the world-famous cronut has been released in the new cookbook, Dominique Ansel: the Secret Recipes. Considering that this croissant-donut hybrid had foodies, trend-followers, and tourists alike camping out overnight in New York to get in line to try one of 300 produced per day at Dominique Ansel Bakery, and was sold on the black market (where it went for over $100!), it might be worth it to carve out some time to attempt to recreate this delicacy in your own kitchen.
I will admit to being one of the crazies who awoke at an ungodly hour to stand in line for the cronut—an experience I do not regret! There was a great camaraderie standing in line at 6 a.m. in Soho, lots of cameramen were there filming the craze, and they gave us free mini Madeleine cookies ~ 7 a.m. I would love to enjoy another cronut in my lifetime, however, after examining the cronut recipe, I get the sense that my baking skills might not quite be up to scratch. I applaud anyone with the courage to take this on.
Initial thoughts reading the recipe:
- Difficulty: extreme… seems a bit more challenging than my usual go-to dessert recipe (brownies). Doubtful that 7th grade cooking class will have prepared me for this.
- Ingredients: fairly boring—I was expecting something top secret? Really, all you need is a flour, a massive amount of butter, and a few different kinds of sugar. Seriously, grapeseed oil (used to fry the butter block, see below) is as exotic as it gets.
- Most concerning: contains 26 tablespoons of butter per batch.
- Equipment / supplies: Requires much more than I have in my dorm kitchen (1 pot, 1 pan).
- Strangest direction: "Make butter block" ... what is this? What does it look like? Would be helpful if photos were attached to each step.
- Most interesting: "Leftover flavored sugar can keep in a closed airtight container for weeks and can be used to macerate fruit or sweeten drinks" ... this actually sounds pretty good. Still not convinced, however.
- Who has the mental capacity to read the entire recipe (2,288 words / 12,766 characters), much less actually make it? I'm not sure anyone besides Dominique Ansel.

Welcome back to Listen Up! Your trusted Flyby advisers—two uniquely unqualified, naïve, decidedly uninteresting juniors—are back with the latest advice and invaluable counsel.
Before we delve into the advice, we have one point to raise with some of you. You know who you are. We see you around campus, frantically gesturing in the dining halls, dozing off in lecture, nervously freaking out when your crush walks by—you clearly have problems. But don’t worry, there’s hope: just submit questions to Listen Up. Either click this link or scroll down to the google form below, and help us help you.
Speaking of which, we noticed that one of you accidentally submitted your question to Slate’s advice column Dear Prudence instead of to us. Quite frankly, we feel betrayed. We work tirelessly, night-in and night-out, forgoing our problem sets and research papers, to curate questions and perfect answers. The least that you could do is submit questions to us instead of consulting someone who actually does this kind of thing for a living.
So we’ve taken the liberty of correcting that error and giving you the response you deserve below.
The Dreaded H-Bomb: How do I tell people where I study honestly but with humility?
“How do I go about betraying my fellow classmates and go someplace else for advice?” You don’t.“How do I submit an advice question to someone and not expect Dev and Steven to find out?” You don’t.“How do I seek counsel anywhere other than from your campus newspaper, The “Liberal Arts College Near Boston” Crimson?” You don’t. You just don’t.
******
Now on to addressing people that did the right thing and asked us questions.
I'm a pretty short guy, and I've had multiple girls tell me they can't date me because I'm "cute but too short." How can I convince them to look past my shortcomings [ha ha] and give me a chance?
First of all, we must admit, you’ve given us a tall order to fill. But don’t worry if right now, you don’t stand up to the challenge. Inching your way to top will be hard at the beginning, but one day, you’ll rise to the task. Don’t fret if at first, you fall short of your goal. We promise: one day, you’ll measure up. Soon, you’ll be a head above the rest.
But you won’t have to go at it alone. Thankfully, we have an expert here in seduction for the stunted.
Enter Steven Lee:
I have lived your situation and am here to aid you. Hey, Squirt—can I call you that?—you and I have been hearing the same spiel for years. We both peaked right before puberty hit. And then our peers kept on growing while we kept, well, being the same height.
Maybe you’re pursuing the wrong girls? You have to appreciate them for their candor in their reasoning, but don’t you think it’s a little superficial of them to be so focused on something as inconsequential as height? I mean we are so darn cute, right? If a girl only wants to date you for your height, she’s probably not the kind of person you would want to be your girlfriend.
But if you insist (or if one of these girls is Emma Watson), here are some rapid fire suggestions. 1) Jump up and down when you talk to women. At least some of the time you can seem like you're tall. 2) No one said high-heels are just for women. Some of the most powerful people in the world pad their shoes with humanity's greatest invention since the bifocals. I personally like to use the sneakers that have extra "padding." Support isn't only needed for athletes. You can inconspicuously add an inch with those bad boys. 3) And worst case scenario, if all else fails, drink a lot of milk. May I suggest with Mini-Wheats?
A man left a note on my car while I was in the grocery store that said "Hey! You are very gorgeous. Would you like to grab coffee sometime?" with their name and number on it. Should I get in touch with them?
Let us answer your question with another question. Do you enjoy dating shallow, creepy things? If so, try going out with a small puddle in a sketchy alley, because surely that is a better option than this guy. If he likes you, he should like you because of your brains, your heart, and your spirit, and be willing to say it to your face. And if he wants to take you on a date, he should at least involve more than coffee. At least grab a scone, too.
How do I create a fool proof financial arbitrage?
Nice try. We know it’s recruiting season. We’re not going to regurgitate answers to interview questions.
But given that you’re asking this question to a Flyby advice column, we can verify that your plan definitely needs to be foolproof. We might suggest aiming for a less competitive job. Like President of the Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorento square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
I'm in this seminar class, and I'm not sure if the Professor likes my ideas very much. Even though what I say isn't very different from the other kids' ideas, they tend to get more positive remarks from her. I'm doing well on the homework, and such, but I'm worried that even though I participate a good amount in section, I might still get a lower grade because the Professor doesn't jive with my vibe, so to speak. Is this a legitimate concern?
It may have something to do with the fact that you use the phrase “jive with my vibe.”
All jokes aside, help us out, because we’re a little confused. Are you that annoying kid in section that just steals what other people say? That might be why your professor isn’t warming to you.
And if your ideas are similar to other people’s ideas and your professor likes their ideas but not yours, doesn’t that just mean your professor doesn’t like you as a person? Try using deodorant.

Harvard HoCos throughout time have proven the axioms that history repeats itself and time is a flat circle.
Back in 2001, HoCos also hesitated to release their budgets and only three Houses submitted their funds on time when asked by the Committee on House Life.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ‘67 defended the request. “The student officers who are reluctant are missing the point,” he said. “It’s unfortunate that this request has been thought of as a dean’s plot.” Dingman then cackled and touched the dagger by his side.
According to the article, “Eliot House Committee chair Emily R. Murphy ’03 said she was ‘a little apprehensive’ about what CHL was planning to do once the information was collected.” Maybe they would sell the information to enemies around the globe!
But good old Quincy House, the sweet, obliging People’s House, seemed down. One former Quincy House Committee member Brian R. Smith ’02 said in the article, “Looking at the budgets is a necessary step to getting more money to the Houses and to equalize spending across the Houses.” This year, when Quincy House submitted its budget to the UC, they submitted it in Euros. Really, check it out.
