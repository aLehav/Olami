After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Historically, climate conferences have failed to create binding agreements to mitigate global warming signiﬁcantly. The Durban Climate Change Conference—which took place in South Africa in Dec. 2011—is the latest example of this failure. Although some progress was made at Durban, it was hardly the major step towards climate change mitigation that many hoped for. The new “legal framework” setting binding emissions reductions won’t take effect until 2020, yet in 2010 alone CO2 emissions increased six percent. Last year saw unprecedented extreme weather and glacial melting. Now more than ever, the world’s population requires serious commitments to phasing out fossil fuels and developing renewable energy.
While this international failure is tragic, it is not surprising. Each country has unique economic challenges, values, traditions, and norms, and each is affected by climate change in a different way. One treaty cannot encompass the diverse qualities and needs of every country. Rather than wait for the magic conference that unites all nations, we should expand the role of international bodies to support, exhort, pressure, and coordinate binding legislation at the national level. A brief comparison of the United States, Bolivia, and China illustrates this need.
The environmental movement in the United States is built on unsustainable action. Since the ﬁrst Earth Day in 1970, millions of people have gathered to demonstrate their concern for the environment. But this action has not translated into meaningful change because education it has not been reinforced with education. Americans do not understand how environmental degradation affects their lives. Yet the transition to greener lifestyles will occur when citizens understand what’s going on. A recent report from George Mason University reveals this problem. When asked in 2008 how likely they were to switch to energy-efﬁcient light-bulbs, 44 percent of Americans said they would either like to or deﬁnitely would make the switch. By 2011 that had dropped to 34 percent. In 2008, 42 percent said that Americans’ energy-saving actions would reduce global warming. By 2011, only 26 percent believed this. These ﬁndings suggest that environmental awareness has not taken hold on an individual level. The environmental movement in the US needs to expand its focus to include a national educational agenda that can drive and support social action and policy.
Bolivia’s environmental movement, in contrast, is based upon Andean religion. While living in Bolivia, I learned that the idea of Pachamama—the native Quechua word for “Mother Nature”—pervades society. People want to maintain peace and reciprocity with Pachamama. If a family harvests potatoes, they must in turn sacrifice an animal to keep balance between humanity and Mother Nature. Some Bolivians see modern environmental problems as Mother Nature’s retaliation for humans abusing the Earth. Humans have cut down too many trees without giving anything in return. Now, they believe, we are paying the price with climate change, especially rapidly melting glaciers that threaten water supplies. Other environmental issues plaguing Bolivia—from destructive mining practices to deforestation—are the legacy of centuries of poverty, corruption, and exploitation. Despite this difficult history, spirituality pervades the everyday life of most citizens. Environmental education, while necessary in America, would not be effective in Bolivia just as the spirituality of Bolivians would not mesh with American culture. Bolivia’s top priorities should be more stringent industrial regulation to stop environmental degradation. It will need to develop and acquire green technologies that increase access to water while minimizing environmental harm.
China presents another contrast. It is plagued with severe pollution issues: coal accounts for 70 percent of energy use, and car emissions increase as the number of vehicles in China surpassed 100 million. Yet China has invested more in renewable energy than almost any other country. With a powerful autocracy, China can effect sweeping policy change quickly. China banned all plastic bags in 2008 and has ambitious goals to reduce energy intensity. I lived in China for three months last year, and I met with the major environmental organizations in Shanghai and learned about environmentalism in China. I saw that average Chinese citizens rejected the environmental movement because it was run by foreigners and represented a Western approach. Effective approaches to climate change mitigation will require an authentic Chinese strategy that involves both the government and the people. For example, recycling systems that close the waste loop would have a signiﬁcant impact. China must also bring energy-efﬁcient and eco-friendly products into mainstream consumer markets. The Chinese people require ecologically sound alternatives as well as education and regulation.
The disappointment at Durban should unite environmentalists in forging a new path beyond Durban because the effort to bring about binding international agreements is necessary but not sufﬁcient. The profoundly diverse scenarios of America, Bolivia, and China show that nations are more likely to achieve substantial legislation to mitigate climate change when it is linked to their unique challenges and values. These actions can then be coordinated on an international level to ensure that global targets are met. Change must occur bottom-up as well as top-down. The failure of the Durban conference signals that it is time to rethink a global approach to environmentalism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, Harvard administrators removed the geodesic dome that had served as the home of Occupy Harvard over winter break, leaving the movement without a physical encampment. The transition Occupy Harvard has undergone—from physical occupation of space to meetings and actions—has taken place at Occupies across the country after evictions by city governments and inclement weather.
This transition has provided urgency to philosophical discussions about the purpose and meaning of Occupy. The conversations on this topic that have taken place among the tents and list-serves of Occupy Harvard often parallel discussions happening elsewhere in the global Occupy movement. They center on what some consider a fundamental question of Occupy: Is it a protest or a community? While those who view Occupy as a protest seek to rectify specific problematic practices, those who see Occupy as a community attempt to model a more just society.
Like many of the students, faculty, and staff who worked to organize some of the first Occupy actions on Harvard’s campus, I originally thought of Occupy Harvard as a protest movement. After months and years of fruitless and frustrating discussions with University administrators about issues like ethical investment and benefit parity for indirectly hired employees, I saw Occupy Harvard as a way to escalate these campaigns. I assumed that rallies and a tent city would put more student, alumni, and media pressure on the University to do the right thing.
Indeed, Occupy Harvard has been a very effective protest. It achieved its goal of helping the custodians’ union secure a favorable contract for the next five years. It convinced the University administration to investigate its investment in HEI Hotels and Resorts and to release its first statement about ethical endowment investment since 2005. It sparked national discussion about how classical economics is taught in the college setting. It encouraged discussion about the role of Wall Street recruiters on campus and apparently inspired the Phillips Brooks House and Center for Public Interest Careers to host a conference on public service careers over Wintersession.
Hopefully, as Occupy Harvard turns its attention to the University’s conflict of interest policies and executive compensations, more positive changes will follow. This is exciting for those frustrated with Harvard administrators’ unresponsiveness to previous student requests.
The global Occupy movement is full of disillusioned citizens who have become frustrated that despite their votes and phone calls, elected officials continue to serve the interests of the upper class and Wall Street instead of passing legislation to help the 99 percent. They, too, have succeeded in changing national discourse about income inequality, sparking political moves like President Obama’s proposal for student debt relief, and countering the actions of big banks by installing homeless families into vacant homes.
Many, however, view Occupy as more than simply a protest movement. They consider it a community of like-minded people gathering in tents or in rallies who can work together to address fundamental problems in American society, ranging from wealth disparity to racism and sexism.
Occupy Harvard’s physical encampment did create a space on campus where those interested in economic justice could meet each other, reach out, and connect to the larger community. I spent many hours sitting at Occupy Harvard’s Information Desk, where community members ranging from graduate students to Harvard employees would come to talk about their insufficient health care plans, their fears about being laid off, their frustrations with temporary work contracts. They would note to me, “I never had anyone to tell that to before. Thanks for being here.” The tents in the Yard became a symbol of a community at Harvard that was paying attention to inequality and trying to overcome it.
Similarly, some view the global Occupy movement as an experiment in radical democracy. Every Occupy utilizes consensus-based decision making, a democratic process designed to let every single voice be heard, however loud or wealthy. Occupiers try to envision what a better society would look like and construct it in their own tent cities and gatherings.
Some view the distinction between Occupy as protest and Occupy as community as irreconcilable. The conflict has played out in consequential decisions faced by Occupy: for example, Occupy Wall Street has struggled over whether it is more important for the group to focus on planning new actions (focusing on the “protest” vision of Occupy) or simply finding food and shelter for homeless Occupiers (the “community” vision of Occupy).
However, I believe that protest and community do not exclude each other. Occupy Harvard can work with allies in the administration to organize University-sponsored events about economic inequality (creating a conscious community) while at the same time pressuring the University to change its labor practices and investment policies. Similarly, Occupy movements across the country can form stronger communities while challenging specific corporate or government policies. This combination may let Occupy avoid the inconsistencies of previous social movements like the Civil Rights movement, which ignored blatant chauvinism among its leaders in pursuit of racial justice. In fact, perhaps Occupy could not stand alone as either a protest or a community, and is necessarily both at once.
These two visions of Occupy, as a protest movement and as a new community, may come into opposition as Occupy Harvard creates a vision for its future. However, they need not be radically different, or even in conflict. Existing without a physical encampment allows Occupy Harvard, like Occupations across the country, to explore more fully what, exactly, it wants to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While walking through the Yard on the first day of classes this semester, many Harvard students noticed a conspicuous absence in the Yard. The tarpaulin-covered geodesic dome and information tent, previously the only remaining outdoor symbols of the Occupy Harvard movement, were removed from Harvard Yard on January 13.
While the majority of Occupy Harvard’s tents were dismantled by members of the movement in preparation for winter break, the dome and information tent were taken down by members of the Harvard administration. In explanation, university officials cited safety concerns about the dome: it had blown several feet on a windy day and nearly hit a passerby.
However, members of Occupy Harvard noted in a press release that after the dome blew, they spoke to Harvard’s grounds manager about securing the structure safely and received his assurance that the dome could stay in the Yard if it was secured. As observers, we do not know exactly what sparked University officials to remove the dome from the Yard while protesters were working to secure it: Conflicting accounts make it unclear whether the dome and tent truly posed a safety hazard. Although the administration’s removal of the dome may not have been intended as a political action, the windy day did provide an opportune moment for officials to take down what had undoubtedly become a distasteful symbol of Occupy’s legacy in Harvard Yard.
Issues of safety aside, the removal of the dome raises the larger issue of how free speech can proceed to flourish unhampered on campus. Occupy Harvard has held marches, rallies, and demonstrations everywhere from the Yard to the Institute of Politics to the Office of Career Services. Their diverse tactics have also included an informative teach-in and the production of the “Occupy Harvard Crimson,” a collection of essays. Now that the last remnants of the tent city have been consigned to the dustbin, Occupy Harvard does appear to be in a state of transition. Rallying, demonstrating, and leafleting may return as the principal activities of the movement. However glad many on campus might have been to see the dome go, we should make sure that students and faculty are allowed to continue the activities that are within their rights.  As members of an educational and academic community, the students and staff involved in Occupy Harvard must have the freedom to engage in these forms of protest without fear of disciplinary or financial retribution. Harvard should not impinge upon the right to dissent and to critique, both of which are, after all, important aspects of the free speech that our community holds dear.
We hope that the administration’s action to dismantle the rest of Occupy Harvard’s tent city will allow the movement to proceed in a more productive fashion. Occupy Harvard’s press release about the eviction declares, “Occupy Harvard will redouble its efforts promoting social accountability, public integrity, open academia, and other key values of the Occupy movement for socio-economic justice.” Indeed, without spending time and energy maintaining a physical encampment, Occupy Harvard will be able to focus on more productive issues and more effectively address its stated grievances.
We look forward to seeing what direction Occupy Harvard will take now that its tent city has been entirely disassembled. We hope that the University will guarantee their right to do that with free speech.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 19, Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton told stunned Harvard Library staff that their numbers were to shrink. She announced that the cuts would be accomplished by July, through voluntary and involuntary means. Officials would rewrite some job descriptions and eliminate other jobs completely, and staffers would have to apply for a smaller number of reconfigured positions.
In the wake of media attention to widely shared tweets about Shenton’s disclosures, a University spokesperson tried to downplay the anxieties of employees. Despite such efforts, Shenton’s remarks are sparking a new wave of worker-led protests on the Harvard campus.
When the University’s clerical staffers last faced mass layoffs in 2008, their Harvard No Layoffs Campaign drew the attention of national and international press. In collaboration with Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement, rank-and-filers in the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers joined forces with concerned local residents, faculty, non-union workers and members of other campus unions also hit hard by job losses. The coalition organized a sustained wave of demonstrations, which featured picketers blocking traffic in Harvard   Square, as well as multiple actions during the University’s lavish Commencement exercises. Today, activists will meet to plan a revival of the Harvard No Layoffs Campaign.
During its last wave of mass layoffs, Harvard maintained, unpersuasively, that a drop in its huge endowment made job losses inevitable. After a 21.4 percent jump in the endowment during the last fiscal year, to $32 billion, Harvard cannot possibly make any such claims today. Union activists believe the University’s plans to cut costs come at the expense of local communities. In a particularly ominous development, 15 out of 22 employees at Harvard Health Publications learned on January 11 that they would lose their jobs in March. The devastated staffers of HHP must wonder how they will find new positions in the current bleak economy. As of last week, library workers must wonder the same thing.
However, since 2008, the ground has shifted. The Occupy Wall Street movement has pointed a glaring spotlight at social inequalities, the concentration of wealth, and widespread unemployment. Harvard’s workers have actively participated in Occupy Boston and Occupy Harvard. Important links have been built, and potentially powerful networks have risen up. Employees who stayed on the sidelines of past years’ pickets now boldly advocate direct action to fight the planned cuts. No Layoffs campaigners know they will have many more allies this time around.
They will also have student support. SLAM has supported Harvard’s workers for years. The pro-labor students in SLAM went on a hunger strike in 2007 to press for a fair contract for security officers. Its precursor, the Progressive Student Labor Movement, occupied Massachusetts Hall in 2001, demanding a living wage for all who worked at the University. SLAM’s current incarnation, as vibrant as ever, plays a vital auxiliary role in campus labor struggles.  As recently as December, scores of workers and SLAM members picketed for over an hour in the cold for Marvin Byrd. Byrd, a 61 year old, partially-disabled employee in Harvard University Mail Services, had his weekly hours cut and was compelled to work a mandatory six-day week, alone of all his co-workers. SLAM’s participation on Byrd’s behalf helped make the action one of the largest worker-led pickets for an individual Harvard employee in recent memory. If hundreds of library workers face the total loss of their livelihoods, they can expect a proportionate response from the students who have stood with them for so many years in their struggle for better working conditions.
Meanwhile, library workers continue to perform their duties, knowing that another year of job losses would certainly hurt scholarship on campus. More automation, increased outsourcing to non-Harvard vendors, and further erosion of institutional memory will throw countless roadblocks in the way of the students, faculty and researchers who use Harvard’s libraries. Harvard’s brand will suffer along with workplace morale.  The precious scholarly resources amassed by Harvard, including online databases, will grow less accessible. These unnecessary consequences are a source of great frustration to dedicated employees. If Shenton’s destructive plans go forward, campus workers will soon have myriad opportunities to vent that frustration in public.

David M. Axelrod, one of President Barack Obama’s top political advisors and a board member at the Harvard Institute of Politics, is planning to open a new Institute of Politics at his alma mater, the University of Chicago.
Inspired by the success of the Harvard IOP, the new group—for which Axelrod will serve as director—will aim to help young people explore careers in public service.
“We’ll be making the University of Chicago a top destination for newsmakers, political actors, people in the public arena,” said Axelrod in a conference call on Wednesday, adding that it is increasingly important to get fresh faces involved in politics “in a time of great cynicism.”
Although the new institute uses the Harvard IOP as a blueprint, Axelrod said it will have some distinct priorities, many of which are related to its location. In addition to giving Chicago a larger presence in national politics, the new institute hopes to place greater emphasis on “urban politics,” said Axelrod.
C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, the director of the Harvard IOP, believes that this direction could be beneficial to the new institution’s growth and identity.
“Harvard’s IOP reflects a very national and international focus,” said Grayson. “You’ve got the challenges that nations face, and also the problems that urban youth face in terms of issues like schools and transportation.”
The institute is not scheduled to open until January 2013, and because Axelrod still faces the substantial hurdle of the 2012 presidential election, its programming is a work in progress.
But following what he refers to as “the last campaign,” Axelrod hopes that he will be able to put aside the competitive work of national election strategy and make his new IOP “studiously nonpartisan or multipartisan.”
Axelrod said that he will step down from the Harvard IOP board at the end of 2012, and make this new institute his main priority.
Another area in which the Chicago IOP has standout potential, Grayson said, is its close association with Obama. Axelrod said the new IOP will “look for ways to create synergy” with Obama, perhaps through housing all or part of the future Obama Presidential Library.
In addition to the close ties Axelrod and Obama share, Obama served as an Illinois state senator in a district that includes part of the University of Chicago and taught at the University of Chicago Law School.
The institute already has a number of recognizable public figures as board members, including historian Dorris Kearns Goodwin, Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and New York Times columnist David Brooks. Axelrod hopes that this star power will lead to high levels of student involvement.
“My goal right now is to help encourage young people who are going to be, you know, the David Axelrods and better of the future,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the dome in Harvard Yard to the tents in Boston’s Dewey Square to the camp near Wall Street that started it all, Occupy movements across the country have shut down in recent weeks. But students, faculty, and staff at the University of Massachusetts Boston bucked the trend Monday, when they raised a new, indoor encampment inside the university’s campus center.
The novice occupiers pitched tents and held signs sporting slogans like, “We want education, not a corporation,” and “UMass for the working class.”
Organizers estimated that 25 to 30 people participated in the first day of the movement. Through a series of general assemblies, they planned to create a set of official goals.
In the meantime, organizers agreed on a few aims which they were confident the movement would pursue, including reduced fees; more student, faculty, and staff representation on the university’s board of trustees; and a return to the philosophy which they believe was UMass’ founding purpose.
UMass Boston senior Stephanie Fail said that one of the most important demands the movement can make is that UMass Boston remain affordable for low-income students.
“Even though they are not allowed to raise the tuition, the trustees are allowed to raise fees, and they use that loophole to make students pay thousands of dollars more,” Fail said. “The fees really hurt those of us who aren’t as economically privileged.”
She said that putting students and staff on the university’s board would help accomplish that goal.
The board that oversees the University of Massachusetts system’s five campuses, including Boston, has 19 voting members, two of whom are students. The two campuses which receive a student vote rotate each year.
Paul Atwood, a professor of American Studies at UMass Boston who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1979, said he hopes the movement will help UMass fulfill its original mission, which he said charged the public institution with educating poor and urban youth.
“The university was founded to serve an unserved population,” Atwood said. “The university is in the midst of a transformation into what it hopes will be another research institution. We have plenty of those in Boston. What we need is an institution of higher education for people who don’t have the privilege of being born into the elite.”
Atwood said that he is optimistic that the UMass movement can cause change, despite the fact that many Occupy movements have abandoned their physical encampments.
“I’m impressed by the quality of the intellectual arguments made by students,” Atwood said. “I hope that our university will follow Harvard’s example and make sure there is room for this protest and for this free speech.”
At Harvard, administrators decided to close the gates of the Yard while protesters camped for six weeks. The group voluntarily removed its tents before winter break but kept an information desk and a large dome, both of which were seized by administrators in January.
William P. Whitham ’14, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement at Harvard, said that SLAM has provided materials to Occupy UMass Boston.
“I’m definitely glad to see another Occupy movement, especially on a college campus,” Whitham said.

As third-party political advertising comes under increased scrutiny, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Scott Brown signed an agreement Monday in an effort to limit the role such advertisements play in the upcoming Massachusetts Senate election.
The “Peoples’ Pledge” stipulates that if a third-party group runs an advertisement promoting a particular candidate, that candidate must donate 50 percent of the advertisement’s cost to a charity of the other candidate’s choosing.
The “Pledge” gives a candidate three days to make the donation. The campaigns will be responsible for monitoring advertisements and ensuring that penalties are paid.
“People have a right to make a decision in their Senate race based on what the candidates say and what the candidates do,” Warren said at a press conference Monday after the agreement was made. “Not based on what Karl Rove and the super PACs can accomplish.”
Brown expressed a similar sentiment in a statement released Monday.
“This is a great victory for the people of Massachusetts, and a bold statement that puts super PACs and other third parties on notice that their interference in this race will not be tolerated,” Brown wrote.
The agreement—which pertains to all third-party television, radio, print, and online advertisements—follows two weeks of back and forth between the two frontrunners for the Massachusetts Senate seat.
On Friday, representatives from both campaign had been unable to settle on an agreement, with the Warren campaign arguing that the Brown camp’s proposal was not strict enough.
After tweaking the language of the proposal concerned with internet and “sham” advertising, the Warren campaign forwarded a new draft of the pledge to Brown Monday morning which he promptly signed.
The pledge is the first of its kind  since the Supreme Court ruled two years ago that the government cannot restrict independent organizations’ political spending. That ruling has given rise to large, well-backed political organizations called “super PACs” which have drawn much attention this election season.
Harvard professors and Massachusetts political analysts expressed skepticism about the enforcability of the “Peoples’ Pledge.”
Laws prohibit candidates from coordinating with third-party organizations, and questions remain over whether super PACs will have any incentive to stop advertising despite the fines candidates may face.
Institute of Politics Director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said that because the agreement has garnered much publicity, the effort may be effective in the short term. But Grayson said that he expects unaffiliated groups will ramp advertising as the election draws closer.
“They can look at the agreement, and understand what the candidates are doing,” Grayson said of third-party groups. “But do they really care? They aren’t on the ballot box.”
The candidates have sent co-signed letters to third-party groups asking them to cease all advertising on behalf of the candidates. Letters were also sent to local television and radio broadcasters requesting that they refuse to accept any advertisements from third-party groups pertaining to the race.
“You can ask them not to. You can say it’s going to hurt the people you’re trying to help,” Warren said. “Ultimately I don’t kid myself about this. The law is what the law is following Citizens United and these groups legally can come in and play their dirty tricks and try to do everything they can to shape this race.”

Jason Segel, star of the recent Muppets film and multifaceted entertainer in the film, television, and music industries, was named the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2012 Man of the Year on Monday.
Segel will be recognized at the Man of the Year festivities on Feb. 3, when he will be roasted and presented with his Pudding Pot in Farkas Hall, followed by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ premiere of their 164th production, “There Will Be Flood.”
Segel joins actress Claire Danes, who was named the 2012 Woman of the Year by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals last week. Danes has appeared in films like “Romeo + Juliet,” television programs such as “Homeland,” and many theater productions.
According to a press release, the annual award is given to a man and woman “whose work has made an indelible mark on the world of entertainment.”
“Segel has brilliantly demonstrated his skill as an actor, writer, and producer,” said Tyler B. Faux ’13, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ press and publicity manager. “With the release of this year’s film ‘The Muppets,’ which he pitched, wrote, and starred in, Segel embodies the spirit of the Hasty Pudding in combining theater, comedy, and music.”
Segel’s career in entertainment has spanned different media, from television to film, beginning with the 1999 Emmy-nominated TV show “Freaks and Geeks,” and the CBS show “How I Met Your Mother,” now in its seventh season.
Beyond television, Segel collaborated with Judd Apatow on the 2007 comedy “Knocked Up.”
He then wrote and starred in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” in 2008. Propelled by the film’s success, Segel wrote and co-produced its sequel, “Get Him to the Greek,” in 2010, for which he also co-wrote most of the soundtrack.
Segel has also starred in “I Love You, Man” with Paul Rudd and “Bad Teacher” with Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake.
“I admire how much he has been able to accomplish across comedy, writing, songwriting, film, and television,” said Marta Bralic ’12, Man and Woman of the Year manager. “He has had tremendous success and has delighted audiences with his humor and talent, and we cannot wait to honor him.”
James P. Fitzpatrick ’12, president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and a member of the Harvard Lampoon—a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine—said that when Segel was announced as Man of the Year, the Pudding company was thrilled.
“Segel is their hero, their idol, a demi-god of humor sent from the Mount Olympus of Comedy to strangle the Nemean lion that is prosaic college life and, like lamb-bearing Hermes, to raise these young children of laughter to the very heights of the heavens,” he said in typical Lampoon jest.
The Man of the Year has been an annual tradition since 1963. Past honorees include Bill Cosby, Tom Hanks, and Jay Leno, who was last year’s Man of the Year.
Danes will be honored at a Woman of the Year ceremony on Jan. 26.

For the third consecutive week, the Cambridge City Council failed to determine which of its members would serve as the new mayor of Cambridge, leaving the city’s School Committee in the lurch without its final member.
Of the nine councillors, all of whom are eligible to be elected mayor, Marjorie C. Decker and Leland Cheung each garnered three votes on Monday night when the Council made its third attempt this year to pick a mayor. Henrietta Davis, Craig A. Kelley, and Timothy J. Toomey Jr. each received one vote—because all three voted for themselves.
The nine members of the Council, who were elected by Cambridge citizens in November, choose the city’s mayor from their number by casting votes at their weekly meetings. A candidate must receive five votes to win. Voting at this week’s meeting was identical to the previous vote.
In the popular election for the Council in November, Cheung received the most first-place votes of all 18 candidates in the race, outpacing the closest candidate, Toomey, by more than 300 votes. Decker placed seventh overall of the nine councillors.
“Insofar as elected councillors are supposed to be representatives of the citizenry, Leland did it. He topped the ticket; he had very deep support.... He’s the only one who can make that claim,” said Robert Winters, a local political pundit and four-time City Council candidate.
But Winters added that as one of the newest members of the Council, Cheung—who was elected to his first two-year term as a councillor in Nov. 2009 and is a student at the Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management—might face resistance from more senior members.
“If I was somebody like Henrietta Davis or [Councillor E.] Denise Simmons or Timothy Toomey, I might feel a little bit resentful,” Winters said. “Who does he think he is?”
Davis and Toomey voted for themselves, but Simmons, who served as mayor in 2008 and 2009, cast her ballot for Cheung on the second and third go-rounds.
Touting her fitness for the job, Decker emphasized the mayor’s role as the chair and the seventh voter on the School Committee.
“As somebody who has two children who will be entering the public school system here in Cambridge, and as someone who has focused on issues of early childhood education over the last two years—what I have is a history and a record of showing that issues of education are important to me beyond a mayor’s race,” Decker said.
Though he received only his own vote on all three ballots so far, Kelley said that his ten years as a parent of Cambridge students have prepared him well for the mayoral post.
“I think I’m much, much more qualified to address school-related issues,” Kelley said.
In the meantime, Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, who has served three terms as mayor in his 22 years on the Council, is filling in as the seventh member of the School Committee. Winters said that the temporary assignment may hinder the six popularly elected members of the School Committee from making long-term decisions.
“Having the pretend chair is not really right,” Winters said.
Historically, the selection of a mayor has frequently bogged down Council business for weeks. In 2009, the Council took six ballots to select Mayor David P. Maher. In 1948, when councillors voted many times each week, they needed more than four months and 1,300 ballots to make a choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Between 2 and 4 p.m., Sever 113 was supposed to host students shopping Government 1093: “Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature.” But by 3:30 p.m., Sever 113 was empty. Three words were written in chalk on the blackboard: “Go to Sanders.”
Government 1093 was one of many unexpectedly crowded courses that attracted students on the first day of shopping period on Monday.
Madison L. Coveno ’14 was shopping the class for a friend whose flight was delayed. When Coveno went to Sever 113, she found a “ridiculously crowded” classroom.
“I overheard someone saying something along the lines of, ‘I thought I had found a hidden gem, but it looks like a lot of people felt the same way,’” Coveno said.
Kerstin Haase, one of six teaching fellows for the class, said that when students started piling into Sever, they spilled out of the corridors into Tercentenary Theater.
“People were sort of pouring out of the room. That’s how crowded it was,” Haase said. “One you left the room, it was sort of hard to get back in.”
While Haase estimated the number of students to be around 600, Julia Kete ’13, a Crimson magazine writer, estimated slightly less than 1,000.
After twenty minutes, during which government professor Michael J. Sandel and stem cell and regenerative biology professor Douglas A. Melton made phone calls to explore the possibility of changing rooms, the class was moved to Sanders Theater.
The professors said they will try to reserve Sanders Theatre and recruit more teaching fellows in an effort to accommodate all the students who want to take the course.
Several other courses suffered from overcrowding. Jeremy Ying ’13 left Societies of the World 24: “Global Health Challenges: Complexities of Evidence-Based Policy” after five minutes because he decided it wasn’t worth it to stand by the door, where he couldn’t see the class slides.
Public health professor Sue J. Goldie estimated that 350 to 400 students attended the lecture, packing the stairs, floor, and outside hallway.
“It seems popular because it is an interesting, relevant topic, and Professor Goldie is really enthusiastic and gives the class great energy,” wrote Peter Grogan ’15 in an email to the Crimson. “The class is done by lottery, which is disappointing to some degree because as a freshman it will be hard for me to get in, but I understand the system.”
Although not nearly as crowded as Government 1093 or Societies of the World 24, Science of the Physical Universe 22: “The Unity of Science: From the Big Bang to the Brontosaurus and Beyond” provided a light-hearted option for 70 to 100 shoppers. University Professor Irwin Shapiro’s lecture, which included the use of a blowtorch, a magician’s hat, and a wand, was followed by a round of applause—a first for Shapiro.
“That was a shock to  me, I must say. It was nice,” Shapiro said. “I like to inject humor when it’s appropriate...but I don’t have any more top hats.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Until Jan. 18 of this year, the Trinity men’s squash team was untouchable, taking home a nearly unfathomable 13 straight national titles on a 252-match winning streak. But less than a week ago at Yale’s Brady Squash Center, the top-ranked Bantams’ run came to an end, as the No. 2 Bulldogs pulled off a dramatic, 5-4 upset.
To say Trinity’s run is impressive would be a gross understatement.
But the fact that the longest winning streak in the history of intercollegiate athletics became a reality on the squash court rather than another venue in another sport shouldn’t be that surprising. In the history of men’s college squash, dating back to 1942, exactly five different schools have earned the title of national champion. Yes, you read that correctly: just five teams over the course of nearly seven decades.
Harvard ranks right at the top of that list with 30 national championships to its name, including two six-year streaks as well as five in a row from 1994 to 1998.
Trinity’s 13 titles push the school to a not-so-close second place on the all-time scale. And Yale and Princeton cap off the Ivy League’s dominance of the national squash scene with 12 and 10 national championships, respectively. And for those of you keeping count: the United States Naval Academy earned the remaining three titles.
But with the recent fall of Trinity at the hands of the Bulldogs—and the effective end of a streak dating back to the year after the movie Titanic graced the box office with its record-breaking presence—there is decidedly more parity on a national scale this season than the squash world has ever seen.
Before the start of the 2011-2012 campaign, Ancient Eight teams met up during preseason for the annual Ivy Scrimmages. No. 5 Harvard came out on top, claiming a 5-4 victory over the Bulldogs in the finals of the single-elimination bracket after taking down No. 3 Princeton in the semis.
Put that together with the 5-4 Yale victory over Trinity and the fact that Harvard fell to Princeton by the same score, and you have at least four teams seriously contending for the national title—none of which are undefeated.
And don’t count out Rochester and Cornell—two teams that are looking to put their name on the trophy for the first time. Yale and the Yellowjackets battled to a 5-4 Bulldog victory on Saturday, while Cornell fell to Yale by the same score earlier this year.
Trinity bounced back from its ninth loss in coach Paul Assaiante’s time at the helm of the program—the coach has amassed 312 wins as of this weekend—with a commanding 7-2 victory over the Crimson.
For purpose of contrast, let’s jump back to the 2010-2011 campaign in which the preseason rankings for the top seven schools in the nation exactly matched the outcome of the national championship bracket. And all seven of those top schools—in order: Trinity, Yale, Princeton, Rochester, Harvard, Cornell, and Dartmouth—finished the year in exactly the same slot as in 2009-2010.
Don’t get me wrong, there were some upsets leading up to Trinity’s 13th Potter Cup, including No. 6 Cornell’s midseason takedown of Harvard. But overall, the preseason rankings were absurdly indicative of the season’s outcome.
No matter which team emerges victorious at the end of the current season, the road to the Potter Cup will likely be a lot more, as sophomore Gary Power put it after his team’s recent match against the Bantams, "interesting."
All eyes are on Yale right now, who—after beating Trinity—has established itself as a team to beat this year. And the recent, major victory in New Haven is cause for fans of Ivy League squash (and competitive sports in general) to celebrate. But the Bulldogs themselves shouldn’t throw any parties just yet.
Trinity still has a streak to defend—in my eyes, a more important one than 252 straight wins—and that’s 13 national titles in a row.
The Bantams made quick work of Harvard this Saturday, taking down the Crimson in five straight matches on the way to the 7-2 victory. And as they say all too often in sports: it’s not over ’til it’s over. With about a month still to play until Princeton hosts the CSA Team Championships, the 2011-2012 squash season really is just beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a rebuilding year peppered with strong performances by its freshman class, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (9-13, 1-7 EIVA Hay) is looking to continue building upon the core foundation that it created with last year’s team.
"Last season, as a freshmen unit, we were able to get a lot of playing time and develop as collegiate competitors," said sophomore outside hitter Michael Owen. "Though we did make a few rookie mistakes, it better prepared us for this season and gave us an opportunity to learn how to play together."
The experience of seeing time as freshmen may pay dividends this year, but Coach Brian Baise took no chances when he decided to change the way the team prepares for this season.
"This season we came back to campus to train a week earlier than normal, so we were able to train together for a full three weeks before we even have our first match against Endicott," said sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden. "The extra week really allowed us to bond further as a team and better prepare ourselves for the upcoming season."
Coach Baise not only changed the amount of time the Crimson spent together training but also the way in which they trained.
"Coach modified our lift, and we lifted hard in the preseason," Madden said. "We were in even better shape coming into this season. We are looking to be much more physical this year after all the workouts and time spent in the gym."
With a tougher schedule this year due to a change in the structure of league play, Harvard will have the chance to prove itself early and often as a contender in the EIVA. In the new format, each team will play all seven of its conference opponents both home and away instead of just matching up twice against teams in its specific four-team subdivision.
This year’s freshman class also looks to contribute on the court right away. Freshmen opposite hitter John Manzo, outside hitter DJ White, and middle hitter Caleb Zimmick are all additions that will likely see a lot of time this season.
"If you look at our roster, we are still a young team," sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. "But the great thing about our team is that everyone has the potential to contribute right now, which is great because it provides depth."
The team as a whole returns all but one starter from last season. And with all that experience on the floor, team chemistry is only expected to grow.
Co-captains outside hitter Matt Jones and libero Dan Schreff will continue to provide a steady hand to a young team.
"This year we are looking to just come out strong both in our regular schedule and in conference play," said Jones. "We struggled a bit last season but we had moments where we played really well. We’re looking to maintain some consistency this season. I think with all the time we’ve played together, we will have better passing and chemistry."
Harvard will also be returning to California this season for the second time in nearly a decade to face Cal State Northridge, Pepperdine, and Cal Baptist.
"The trips to California are great, because many of us are actually from California," Owen said. "Being able to compete against a few of the talented teams that we have heard about our whole lives challenges us to perform well, day in and day out."
The Crimson is looking to start off just as hot as last spring, when it won six of their first seven matches.
"Last year we were able to come together quickly to get quite a few wins," Jones said. "But this year, we know going in that it’s all about getting those all-important conference wins."
Unlike last year, in which the Crimson faced several weeks of competition before its first conference matchup, Harvard will have its first conference game of the 2011-2012 campaign this Saturday.
"It is really important that we be fully prepared going into the year because of the way our schedule runs with the changes to league play and the early conference games," Madden said. "With all the work we put in this year and last, preparing ourselves as a team, we’re just ready to go out and compete."
The combination of experience, preparation, and the return of its leadership this season has given the Crimson new confidence going into its first match against Endicott in Beverly, Mass. this week and the tough season ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard wrestling team just breaking into the Top 25 last week, the Crimson was met with an immediate test when it travelled to Ithaca to take on No. 5 Cornell.
But for junior co-captain Walter Peppelman, the pressure makes the match more exciting.
"I like wrestling in the spotlight, the big matches, and the national tournaments," Peppelman said. "I used this match as practice for that, because I like wrestling when the pressure is on and it really matters."
In what was otherwise a disappointing weekend for Harvard, Peppelman shined against Big Red sophomore Ryan Dunphy, winning an 8-0 major decision.
Peppelman started the bout strongly, taking down Dunphy with an inside trip in the first 10 seconds. Peppelman rode the sophomore out for the remainder of the first period, notching 2:50 of riding time as he ended the first period ahead, 2-0.
Even in light of his early dominance, Peppelman did not slow down. After choosing down for the second period, the Harrisburg, Pa. native escaped from Dunphy over a minute into the period and then recorded a takedown to extend his lead to 5-0.
And after earning another takedown in the third and gaining a point for his 4:21 riding time, Peppelman earned his second major decision of the season, defeating Dunphy, 8-0.
Peppelman was one of two Crimson wrestlers to earn a win on the weekend. But for Peppelman, leadership is nothing new. The junior is currently in his second season as a team co-captain.
"I’ve worked with two of my coaches and my co-captain last season, and I learned a lot [from last year’s experiences]," Peppelman said.
Freshman Ryan Osleeb, who registered a win in his first dual-season meet in Ithaca, believes Peppelman has had a strong influence on the beginning of his college career.
"He is an established leader and someone that I could look to during my freshman year to see how to work at that level," Osleeb said. "He’s an incredibly hard worker and a great overall person."
Osleeb also credited Peppelman with helping the team prepare mentally as well as physically.
"He is always trying to relax the team and get them in the right direction, whether it’s the small things or keeping everyone focused in a tournament," the freshman said.
But the Leverett House resident was also quick to credit his teammates’ work ethic for helping the team succeed.
"On our team, we don’t have just one or two leaders," Peppelman said. "I have a team of 20 leaders. So my job as captain is to bring the best out of everyone. But I’m blessed to be at Harvard, and it’s really easy because I am surrounded by so many great leaders."
Peppelman’s leadership prowess has gone from athletic to academic, as the junior believes some of his coursework has helped him become a better leader.
"I actually took a sociology class with Professor [David] Ager on leadership and organization that was really interesting," Peppelman said. "I’ve gotten really interested in leadership and I’ve learned a lot about empowering my teammates."
Peppelman’s decisive victory earned him immediate national recognition, as the NCAA released the first coach’s panel ranking of the season. Peppelman now finds himself ranked fourth in the country in the 157-pound weight class.
While Peppelman feels honored by the NCAA acknowledgement, he is focused on his long term goal of claiming a national championship.
"It’s always nice to be ranked high," the grappler said. "But it is not what is important right now. The goal is to win a national title, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done before that can happen."
Peppelman will next see action on Saturday, when Harvard takes on Army at home. But Peppelman has set an ambitious goal for himself as he tries to help his team push towards the EIWA championships.
"I’d like to win out," Peppelman said. "It’s an ambitious goal."
But given Peppelman’s recent results and his impressive leadership this season, one can be sure he will be the one to watch as the Crimson pushes through its dual meet season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first day of shopping period is a hectic one for many students, but the Harvard men’s basketball team looks comfortable in the USA Today/ESPN Coach’s Poll, earning a spot for the sixth straight week and moving up to No. 23.
But the Crimson finds itself out of the AP Top 25 for the third straight week with only 32 points.
Harvard’s only competition in the past week was in its victorious trip to Hanover to take on Dartmouth in the team’s second Ancient Eight game of the season.  And while the Crimson prevailed, 54-38, the game was characterized by sloppy play on both sides.
Harvard missed its first nine field goal attempts, but freshman guard Corbin Miller notched 13 points coming off the bench to inspire the offense as the game progressed.
The Crimson will need to improve on its performance in Hanover, as the team travels to New Haven Saturday to take on Yale.
The Bulldogs, arguably Harvard’s toughest opponent remaining on the schedule, will rely on senior forward Greg Mangano on both sides of the court, as the big man is averaging 19.4 ppg, 2.5 bpg, and 10.3 rpg.
After facing the Elis, Harvard will travel halfway home before taking on Brown this Sunday to close out its Ancient Eight weekend road trip.
