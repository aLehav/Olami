After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While it’s far from an explosive film, at least Robert Redford’s “The Company You Keep” does start with a bang. Fuzzy black-and-white and faded color newsreels  fill the screen with alternating fast-talking heads and clouds of  smoke; the footage features both shots of the Vietnam War and scenes of  bombing on the home front by the militant protest group Weather Underground. The film clearly desires to be important and historically relevant, and  it seems at first to be that rare movie that is both thrilling and  thoughtful. Yet despite its electric opening montage and some suspense  early on, the film ultimately lapses into a personal drama more  concerned with the relationships of its half-baked—but mostly  well-acted—characters than with the moral quandaries it only barely  grazes.
 
Redford himself plays Jim Grant, probably the best developed character in the film—and, thanks to the  ever-present vintage Redford charm, far and away the most likable.  Grant, a widower with an adorably spirited daughter (Jackie Evancho),  was a Weather Underground operative in his youth, but was driven into  hiding by a murder charge; for the past 30 years he has been laying low  as a lawyer in Albany, New York.
 
There  are few stars like Redford left, men who can command a screen with  little more than a half-smile. In fact, for most of the movie, Redford’s  Grant sports a cap pulled low and a pair of dark aviators. In this mode  he is a composed action hero, and without the guise he becomes a  bright-eyed, loving father with just enough gruffness to be believable;  Redford embodies both personae with his experienced hand.
 
The action hero emerges when a former militant and accomplice, Sharon Solarz (Susan Sarandon), is arrested by the FBI and a young reporter named Ben Shepard (a bespectacled and scruffy Shia LaBeouf)  digs up the truth about Grant. As Shepard, LaBeouf is never much more  than a pair of puppy dog eyes and a swarm of questions. As Grant becomes  a fugitive, the film tries to make Shepard a second protagonist by  introducing a touch of romance and a break-in scene at his apartment;  however, the admittedly enthusiastic LaBeouf never becomes much more  than an observer, a mechanism to reveal plot points. It doesn’t help  that the power players who appears in cameos throughout the movie—such  as Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Nick Nolte, and Anna Kendrick—consistently  seem more exciting than LaBeouf’s Shepard. Neither LaBeouf nor the  supporting cast can keep the focus off Redford for long, but this is a  good thing, as the story is truly Grant’s. As Grant tries to evade the  unyielding FBI, his path remains baffling to all but Shepard, who  realizes that Grant is after more than escape.
 
There’s  a tricky moral dilemma here, at least at first. The film asks: were  Grant’s actions justified? Do 30 years of clean living make up for a  past misdeed? For a moment, there is an interesting conflict, but the  twists of the film, which themselves are often revealed  anticlimactically, manage to skirt around this tension rather than  confront it. Ultimately, the film is not really about the Weather  Underground at all; it centers on the relationship between Grant and an  old Underground flame, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie).  Their past relationship is often discussed but only vaguely sketched,  and it is presented in a way that makes it overwhelmingly uninteresting.  He’s changed but she’s the same, yet he’s not over her and she’s moved  on. It’s not unoriginal stuff, but in a movie that purports to be  significant, it feels like a distracting cop-out from actually dealing  with the film’s historical background.
 
All  these quibbles would be minor if the film was actually entertaining.  But Redford makes sure not to let the blood pressures of his viewers  rise too high, almost always keeps things chugging along at a leisurely  pace. Aside from a tense, intricately intense escape scene in a New York  hotel, the most truly captivating part of this film is watching its  guest stars outshine Shia LaBeouf. “The Company You Keep” is a political  thriller with few thrills and little real discussion of politics, and  not even Redford’s wizened smile can cover up the emptiness at its core.

Next month will be the 20th anniversary of the day my father permanently lost vision in his left eye due to a fatal surgical error. Currently, this eye is slightly shriveled, glossed over, and completely blind — a physical reminder of the frustration my father felt as a victim of medical malpractice. Exacerbating this already tragic situation, my father never received a clear answer regarding why this complication occurred because his surgeon avoided any inquiries about the subject. Almost all medical malpractice testimonies share this common theme of unanswered questions and helpless frustration. If anything, my father was “lucky” to realize his predicament days after his surgery. Dr. Frederick S. Southwick, for example, shares how a surgical mistake 17 years ago eventually resulted in amputation of his left leg.
Before embarking on an arguably justifiable rampage of the quality of America’s modern healthcare malpractice system, let’s stop to consider what compelled these surgeons to avoid admitting these mistakes. From the doctor’s perspective, there are several compelling reasons to not admit preventable errors. These include today’s negative stigma associated with making mistakes in medicine and a lack of meticulously accurate quality inspections in medicine, which more easily allows doctors to get away with their mistakes if they so choose. It’s difficult to imagine why doctors wouldn’t want to keep their mistakes secret given the negative consequences they face if a mistake proves fatal, including losing a patient’s trust, millions of dollars in a malpractice case, and even a medical license. In order to persuade doctors to admit their mistakes, we need to create an environment with more compelling reasons to own up to their errors rather than keep them hidden.
In the early 19th century, doctors could comfortably admit mistakes and were even encouraged to do so as potential teaching opportunities. Of the few malpractice cases conducted during that time, most were decided in favor of the doctors, and patients were castigated for accusing doctors of making grievous errors without admission, even if such an error actually took place: clearly an unjust time for the patient, but modern medicine has evolved by increasing the patient’s authority in a patient-doctor relationship. However, the increasing frequency of malpractice cases and high expectations of quality medicine, given advancements in medical technology, has created an impossibly high standard for doctors. While in the past, people assumed doctors as inherently perfect beings — “a cultural hero” whose word was trusted as right without question — today, people demand doctors be perfect and meticulously scrutinize them to find anything that seems wrong. Combine this new perspective on doctors with several other factors like decreased intimacy in the patient-doctor relationship and increased commercialization of medicine, and you now have an impersonal business model where little sympathy is given to doctors that make mistakes. We as patients trust doctors with our lives, and we expect perfection, though doctors are human and will inevitably make errors. No wonder so many doctors have an inner God complex.
Physicians recognize how stigmatizing medical mistakes creates such a turbulent environment, and they encourage us to change our perspectives. Professor Henry T. Greely of Stanford University argues that a cultural shift needs to take place before doctors will readily admit their mistakes. Medical doctor Atul Gawande shares a striking story of how a mistake he made almost cost a woman’s life and how he could not even express his mistake among his colleagues without feeling extreme shame and guilt for this natural human occurrence. In an ideal world, doctors would admit mistakes and acknowledge and accept the consequences, and patients would be more forgiving should a mistake occur. However, it is difficult to make such a lofty request of both doctors and patients in this situation, given the life-altering consequences these mistakes can have on the patient.
Instead of asking doctors to bravely accept their fates and patients to blindly forgive a physician who makes a fatal error, a more likely and perhaps equally effective solution would be to reduce the stigma of medical errors and realize that they are, unfortunately, an inherent part of the medical practice — given how complicated the processes are and the human propensity for error. If doctors were encouraged to admit mistakes — unlike my father’s surgeon, who shied away from the subject — patients can take immediate preventative action to fix the mistake, and future generations of doctors can learn from these mistakes as well.
Until we force doctors to admit mistakes or even tape their proceedings, choosing to admit mistakes is a moral dilemma with the wrong incentives. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution to encourage doctors to discuss errors, especially given the multitude of personal reasons why each doctor might choose not to. But by changing our somewhat idealized perception of medicine, we can at least encourage doctors to not be as afraid to admit when they do wrong,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One week ago, Divest Harvard, a campaign spearheaded by Harvard’s chapter of the activist group Students for a Just and Stable Future, inspired over 100 members of the Harvard community to rally outside of Massachusetts Hall to call on the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry. Divest Harvard has proven its organizational strength and resilience in the past few months, coordinating some very successful and well-organized campaign actions. While we applaud the leaders and members of the campaign for engaging students, faculty, and administrators on the crucial issue of climate change, we still, as we have in the past, oppose the campaign’s call for divestment from the fossil fuel industry. We instead hope to see that the national Fossil Free movement direct its organizational capacities toward political channels rather than endowment divestment.
While climate change is certainly one of the most pressing issues of our generation, the moral issues at stake in the fossil fuel industry are not as unambiguous as those that prompted Harvard to divest from industries in the pastm, and divesting from fossil fuels may thus set a dangerous precedent for the University. While it might have been easy to definitively identify human rights violations in the South African regime of the 1980s—when the University did choose to divest its holdings in South African companies—such a definitive judgment cannot be made in this instance.
Take the example of British Petroleum itself, which—although responsible for the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill—has addressed the reality of climate change for almost two decades and has taken steps towards the promotion of alternative energy sources. Former BP CEO John Browne became the first big oil executive to publicly address the need for renewable energy sources as early as 1997, in a speech that he delivered at Stanford.  BP has been investing significantly in its alternative energy program in the past decade. Where even BP’s corporate responsibility falls in an area of grey shades, it seems almost impossible to define divestment targets that would not pose problems of consistency.
The divestment campaign has been laudable in that it has brought grassroots student activism on campus to a level of activity and visibility rarely seen at Harvard. The movement managed not only to garner the approval of 72 percent of student voters in the referendum on divestment from fossil fuels in November’s Undergraduate Council election, but it also succeeded in exerting enough pressure on administrators that University Vice President Marc L. Goodheart ’81 yielded to protesters and collected their petition on Thursday afternoon.
With such strong support and organizational capacity, we hope to see the SJFS-led movement and the national Fossil Free movement still grow, and to advocate ever more strongly for actions to be taken against climate change. But we do not believe that demands for divestment should be the focus of student activism. Instead, we encourage Divest Harvard and other student campaigns to focus their efforts on other targets, such as policymakers, who have the power to reduce fossil fuel subsidies and fund alternative energy sources.

“My body belongs to me, and is not a source of anyone’s honor.”
These words, written in Arabic and plastered across Amina Tyler’s bare-breasted body, elicited backlash from Tunisian Islamic authorities after the 19-year-old posted her nude picture on Facebook.
In response, FEMEN, a Ukrainian feminist group, launched a “Topless Jihad Day,” where members of the group crowded around streets and mosques with phrases such “Arab Women Against Islamism” and “Freedom to All Women” painted on their nude bodies. Their goal was to defend Amina’s rights and, moreover, to liberate Muslim women from the oppression of their Islamic society. And with this goal, FEMEN’s extremely offensive message that Muslim women need liberating is overlooked under the pretense of defending a young woman’s freedom of expression.
Amina’s message is beautiful, and I wholeheartedly agree with it: Her body is hers, and she has the right to use it as she pleases, including as a canvas of expression. It is not the source of anyone else’s honor. I even respect the bold execution—it definitely caught my attention. What I do not appreciate is FEMEN’s inability to accept Muslim women’s definition of freedom. I do not respect their projection of their ideals onto me, or their implication that I am too weak and oppressed to speak for myself.
It is ridiculous how widely accepted it is that Muslim women are oppressed in choosing to cover their bodies. This “clash of civilizations”—more accurately explained as the clash of ignorance by Edward Said—is preserving the idea that Islamic views and Western views cannot coincide. I know how much Western society loves its feminism: I was born and raised into it with a strong, highly educated and respected mother who kicks butt in her field—all while wearing a headdress. That being said, it is almost imperialist to apply Western concepts of feminism to other cultures. There are varying definitions of feminism, and not all urge a woman to flaunt her body because it is her right. On the contrary, feminism from the Muslim perspective encourages women to be modest in their dress and to be seen as equal intellectuals, not merely as bodies.
Just as some women feel strong and confident showing a little skin, veiled Muslim women feel strong and confident covering their skin—and there is nothing wrong with either. The West may see oppression in Muslim women covering their bodies at the will of a male-dominated society in the same way Muslim women may see oppression in the objectification of Western women’s bodies at the hands of a male-dominated society. I am a veiled, Muslim-American woman, and I am also a feminist. The two concepts are not mutually exclusive.
The message that has been spawned by this “noble movement” is disgraceful. FEMEN seems to imply that Islam is to be blamed for global sexism. Imperialist rhetoric that Islam is a woman-hating religion and stands on five pillars of sexism does nothing but aid the global surge of Islamophobia. No other nations, religions, or cultures are targeted to quite the same extent. In turn, this opens the door of opportunity for other countries that have a perpetual track record of discriminating against their women, the U.S. included, to point the finger at Muslim societies.
The vast majority of veiled Muslim women are not oppressed in their hijabs, and even if we were we (and even to those veiled Muslim women who are being oppressed) sure as heck are not seeking liberation from a group of women who will insult our religious beliefs in order to affirm their own self-importance. As another Muslim woman put it, “We won’t be needing any of that ‘White-non-Muslim-women-saving-Muslim-women-from-Muslim-men’ crap!” FEMEN holding up signs that read “Fuck your Morals” is not liberating us—it is simply making us angry. I am all for supporting Amina and her rights, but when it is done through plain offense, Islamophobia, and at the expense of the reputation of over a billion Muslims, I will stand my ground. We do not need saving. We do not need you to defend us. We can speak for ourselves. And moreover, we do not need to flaunt our breasts to feel liberated.
I understand that FEMEN is trying to defend Amina, but supporting her rights by attacking a religion is counterproductive to their movement. If they find freedom through being nude, then that is great. All the power to them. As for me, my mind is my means of liberation. Not my boobs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past year, a number of state legislatures have proposed—and some passed—legislation that would ban covert filming on farms. These measures are intended to protect farmers from undercover exposes of unethical treatment of animals. However, banning these videos has the potential to cover up cases of unethical treatment of animals and let the problem go unnoticed.
The New York Times’s coverage of the legislation suggests that these bills, referred to by critics as “ag-gag bills,” are being written in response to recent videos which have recorded serious violations of animal protection laws. For example, in one recent video, farm workers are shown “soring”—treating the feet of Tennessee walking horses with harsh chemicals, such as gasoline, and then tying metal chains around their hooves to irritate the skin in an effort to exaggerate their desirable high gate. This is a blatant violation of the Horse Protection Act, and the horse trainer and workers were charged. Several other recent videos showing animal abuse and cruel living conditions have brought about legal charges, and in one case resulted in the loss of a major backer, McDonald’s,  for the farm in question. These cases show undercover exposés at their best—as a means of reporting legal violations, bringing them to the attention of the public and fulfilling the duty that regulation theoretically should. It seems hard to imagine how the proposed legislation could do anything other than silence attempts to report criminal practices to the authorities.
Some in favor of this legislation say that, though animal rights violations do exist, online videos often do more harm than good. Often videos cast farmers in an unfair light, and then the damage to the farmers’ reputations and businesses is permanent, as it’s almost impossible to revoke bad press. However, the concept of “unfair” treatment seems alarmingly vague. If videos make false claims, then current legislation regarding libel is already in place to ensure that business’ reputations are protected. If, however, the claims are not false, then the concept of “unfair” depiction seems a rather slippery slope, and its use as a justification for this legislation is slightly alarming: Shouldn’t the public have a right to comment on a business’ practices in a negative light if they are illegal, or even just potentially immoral? And by extension, if a company loses business due to animal abuse, then that should hardly be forbidden—businesses whose ideas or practices are opposed by buyers are designed to fail in a free-market system.
So as not to eliminate undercover videos altogether, some states have found a middle ground: to institute a time limit of between 24 and 48 hours in which individuals may submit recordings of violations to the authorities. At first glance, this seems reasonable. It allows undercover recordings to serve their regulatory function while removing the possibility of a smear campaign. However, when building a case against farms with cruel practices, it is almost impossible to construct a solid case worthy of being presented to the authorities without coverage of practices over a period of time. According to the Times, in the case of the horse trainer who was “soring” his horses, prosecutors “credited the Humane Society,” the organization that obtained the video, “with prompting the federal investigation and establishing ‘evidence instrumental to the case.’” The time limit included in some bills may prevent animal rights groups from collecting a compelling amount of evidence, instead forcing all evidence submitted to be more easily dismissed as a “one-time thing.”
In response to the claim that animal rights abuses will no longer be reported, some are more optimistic about regulation from other sources. Senator Joe Seng, who supported the Iowa bill (the first of this kind to be passed), said that the bill “strikes a balance” because it does not keep “someone who legitimately works [at the facility] from reporting animal abuse.” However, the bill expects that people will report those on whom they rely for a job, a likelihood which is dim at best. And in some states, this isn’t even an option. Greg Steuerwald, chairman of Indiana’s Judiciary committee, was quoted in the Times: “An employee who took a video on a livestock farm with his phone and gave it to someone else would ‘probably’ run afoul of the proposed law.”  Regulation of ethical treatment of animals in farming is not nearly as consistent or stringent as it should be, and this legislation is removing the unofficial system of regulation.
Though it goes without saying that every video has a different effect depending on its creators and the nature of the content, it is clear from several of the high-profile cases that exposé videos do a societal good. But online videos, however useful, are not the answer to the problem. The fact that we need them at all highlights the enormous gap between how much regulation is necessary and how much is actually being implemented. With proper regulation, the entire practice could be made less morally ambiguous, as it would not rely on sham work applications from prospective whistleblowers, and more evenly distributed and consistent in terms of access. If you don’t want people recording on farms, then the optimal solution isn’t to ban recording. It’s to make sure people don’t have to.

Benjamin B. Ferencz sits in Eliot Dining Hall spooning soup into his mouth. Squarish eyeglasses perched atop his nose, Ferencz jokingly tells me to stop interrogating him so that he can eat his soup in peace.
At 94 years old, Ferencz is the last living prosecutor from the Nuremberg trials—which the Allied forces held after World War II for the prosecution of the Nazi leadership. He spent much of his career after the trials working the creation of an International Criminal Court that would handle issues of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The court was ultimately established under his leadership in 2002.
On April 10, Ferencz returned to Harvard. “Tell me your problems,” Ferencz says to me, trying to distract me from the impending interview. I tell him that I have none, that I want to hear his story. The interview begins before Ferencz can sneak back into the servery for dessert.
*****
1. Fifteen Minutes: As a child, did you want to be a lawyer?
Benjamin Ferencz: I was raised in a high crime area in New York. New York at that time was [full] of bootleggers. The Irish gangs would be fighting the Italian gangs for terf. I saw much of crime at a very early age, and decided that I’d rather be on the other side.
I won a scholarship at Harvard Law School for my exam on Criminal Law. I was a poor boy with no money. Without that [scholarship], this would’ve been a much shorter story.
2. FM: How did you come to be part of the Nuremberg trial prosecution?
BF: It was because of my training at Harvard Law School, where I worked as a research assistant to a professor of criminology, [Professor Glueck], that I learned about war crimes. I read every book on the subject at Harvard Law Library. That enabled me to be selected and become a war crime lawyer.
3. FM: Nearly half of the people prosecuted in the case you dealt with were sentenced to the death penalty. How did you feel about that at that time?
BF: It was not a joyous thing for me. I didn’t celebrate. I was relieved that the trial was over. The lead defendant admitted to killing 90,000 Jews. What is the appropriate penalty for that? Anything less would encourage others to do the same. And why should the innocent have to support a man in prison who has done such a crime? We have to think of future victims. Imagine if you were a surviving child and he killed all the members of your family, and then you have to support him in prison and feed him and take care of his health. That would lead to vengeance, justifiable vengeance.
4. FM: During your time serving in the army, did you ever have any moments when you stared into the eyes of your enemy and had a realization?
BF: That’s Hollywood. War is hell. Innocent people killing other innocent people they don’t even know for reasons they don’t even know. I walked down along the Vietnam War Memorial and I kept asking myself: Why, why had all these young people been killed? Why couldn’t we settle this by peaceful means? There is no glory in war. You cannot kill an ideal with a gun.
5. FM: I saw that you were born in Transylvania, and I noticed that you were speaking German at the Eliot House German Table before I arrived. What foreign languages do you know?
BF: Hungarian, French, Spanish, German, but that doesn’t matter. It’s not what language you speak, it’s what you say. And more importantly, it’s what you do.
6. FM: What do you think is a big problem with the law?
BF: Law should be based not merely on comparing criminal statute with particular behavior, although that’s part of it. You have to go much deeper than that. You must change the ethics of the people. You must have more respect for law and order. The biggest crime of all is illegal war-making and it’s what I’ve been trying to stop, not only nation states making war but also radical groups. We have to condemn illegal use of an armed force: The leaders responsible should be called to account if they know in advance that [their actions] will kill large numbers of innocent civilians. That is a crime against humanity and should be punishable as such.
7. FM: What is your solution to solving problems around the world?
BF:  There are very many nasty people in this world. I will give you a three word solution. Law, not war. No matter what the decision is in law, and there may be miscarriages in law, it will always be better than war.
8. FM: What is your motto or credo?
BF: Peace and dignity. That has been my credo all my life and remains the same today. We have to have a world where all people are entitled to live in peace and freedom, regardless of their race or creed.
9. FM: What is your advice for those lawyers who might be dealing with cases that everyone else seems to be against?
BF: Never give up. Never give up. Never give up. Those are my three pieces of advice. If you feel strongly that you’re right, keep on striving to do what you know is right or think is right. Sometimes the situation will change. The law is constantly changing and has to change to keep up with the needs of society. Keep trying.
10. FM: Many people want to change the world, but at the same time feel as if they might not have the power. What do you say to them?
BF: That’s ridiculous. I was a poor immigrant boy. I’m five feet tall. I had no money. I served as a busboy in Divinity School, and ate the leftovers and I was thankful for those leftovers. Otherwise, I would have starved to death. I’ve been given so many muddling awards I can’t keep track of them. If I can do it, why can’t you? Why can’t others?
*****
As the interview wraps up, Eliot Dining Hall is emptying out.  Ferencz lays down his fork and pushes his tray towards me, implying that he wants me to clear his dishes. “Make her work for her interview,” he chuckles.

“I wanted to recomplicate what is so reductive, what has been so reductive and so simple: the bad guys and the good guys,” filmmaker Mira Nair ’79 says. I’m sitting with Nair and two other journalists in a conference room at the Charles Hotel, discussing Nair’s new film, “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” which comes out in May. “I wanted very much to have that complexity of the human being in both characters—not just two countries, not two flags, but two real people.”
Nair’s hazel eyes are ringed with black liner; she looks at me directly when she speaks. Her voice—deep, quick and rich—and her candor (“You look like a bloody freshman!” she says to the Crimson photographer, a senior, when she enters the room) dispel the stiltedness of the glossy wood table, the formal drapes. When she stands up to be photographed, she throws her dupatta over her shoulders with a flare.
If anyone can complicate an overly-reductive truth, it’s Nair. Indian by birth, a Harvard graduate equally at home in East Africa and New York City, Nair has lived the experience of globalization and hybridization communicated in many of her films. In works like “Salaam Bombay!” (1988) and “Monsoon Wedding” (2001), Nair has explored the beauty and contradiction of life in contemporary India and the South Asian diaspora. In “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” Nair treats the struggle of living between traditions in a globalized world from a new perspective: that of a Pakistani man, Changez, caught between the worlds of Wall Street money-grubbing and fundamentalist Islam.
The film, an adaptation of Mohsin Hamid’s novel of the same name, follows Princeton grad Changez as he navigates the world of Wall Street in an increasingly Islamaphobic post-9/11 New York. The film is framed as an interview between Changez, who renounces finance and returns to Pakistan, and an American journalist who suspects him of colluding with terrorists, all against the background of a mounting CIA operation in Lahore.
Nair says the inspiration for the film partly came from an experience she had on Harvard’s campus. “I was getting the Harvard Arts medal,” she explains. “And a young man in the audience stood up.” He was from Lahore, and, he said, personally identified with Nair’s films. “I had just made “Monsoon Wedding,” and he said, ‘How did you make this film about me?’” He invited Nair to Lahore. Nair took him up on the offer.
“When I got there, it was just dazzling,” she says. “As a kid in modern India, you don’t get to go to Pakistan easily or often." Yet her visit to Pakistan, she recounts, was “Just like being in an embrace: incredible largesse, incredible artistic expression, incredible refinement everywhere, which is so not the Pakistan you or I read about.”
The result of this inspiration: “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” Nair’s answer to what she characterizes as the one-sidedness of American discourse on Pakistan and the Muslim world. “In the newspapers and certainly in the movies, it’s always a one-sided conversation. It’s not a conversation. It’s a monologue,” she says. The film’s dialogic allows Pakistan to talk back through Changez. Yet the thriller also elides the notion that people can be reduced to symbols or national affiliations, complicating the nature of the dialogue itself.
In Nair’s work, the political is never far from the aesthetic. In the press packet I am given before the interview, Nair is quoted as saying: “I am interested in creating a visual language for the phenomenon of globalization, which forces the energy of order and chaos to be viewed in the same frame.”
In “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” the glow and chatter of the Pakistani street contrasts with the cold steel of New York skyscrapers; even Nair’s personal aesthetic—she’s wearing bright maroon in the drab conference room—speaks this language. I ask Nair about how she uses art to navigate these divides: as an Indian making a film about Pakistan, as person of socioeconomic privilege who has made films about prostitutes and street children.
She addresses a scene in the film, wherein Changez’s girlfriend, an artist, makes an installation about him that ends up emphasizing cultural appropriation rather than personal connection. “I have confronted this for years, where very well-meaning people make so-called art, or write, or whatever, really believing that they are holding an olive branch of understanding,” she says. “But it lacks the humility of knowledge, of really understanding the layers of a culture.”
I press the point. “And so in your own work, how do you avoid that lack of humility?” I ask.
“I try to be humble,” she answers. “I am a great believer in that reservoir. I’m very straight about what I know, and I’m very straight about what I don’t know.”
I ask her how she navigates this knowledge of her own limitations, her own strengths, in the face of her status as—for many—an “iconic” South Asian filmmaker. In the sometimes uneasy relationship between America and South Asia depicted in her films, does Nair, who straddles both worlds, feel a pressure to make her work in some way representative of South Asian diasporic experience?
“I don’t like to pander. I don’t like to explain,” she replies, looking me straight in the eye. As she talks, she gestures sweepingly with her hands. “I don’t sit there and explain to you that this is what we do. And this is really what we do, but I really shrink from—I just want you to come into this world and deal with it.” Her films, through their visual order-and-chaos, their music, their sheer sensory vitality, force you into all the beauty and uneasiness of those worlds.
“I like to be both sides,” she continues. “I know both, so it’s a recognition of how we are.” Nair gestures broadly. “My feeling is, when you are like that, when you’re utterly local, you become universal without trying.”

Into the front door of Adams C-entryway, past the lobby and the dining hall, through a vestibule, and beyond the bustling dishroom lies the Adams Pool Theater. The Adams Pool Theater is one of many artistic spaces Harvard has re-worked in its 377-year history. The Barker Center, reclaimed in 1997 as a center for the humanities at Harvard, used to be a dining hall for freshmen; Radcliffe women took classes in what is now the Agassiz House Theater; Memorial Hall housed a shooting range in its basement, which now has an assortment of music practice rooms.
Adams House, built around the turn of the 20th century as private dormitories for students who were accustomed to the finer things in life, is the only house at Harvard to have ever maintained a pool. These so-called “Gold Coast” facilities were considered a beacon of wealth at a college known for its old boys’ club.
“Westmorly, as was Claverly and Randolph, were built as fancy apartment buildings,” says Adams House Co-Master John “Sean” G. Palfrey ’67. “The newest ones were built when buildings were transitioning from gas to electric. They had all sorts of elaborate architectural structures; the buildings were supposed to include athletic facilities.” According to an article in The Gold Coaster, the Adams House alumni magazine, wealthy families such as the Vanderbilts paid upwards of $800 a year for their children to enjoy the newfangled creature comforts of central heating, telephones, and indoor plumbing.
“It was built as a resort, almost,” Palfrey says. “They had amenities that the boarding houses around Cambridge did not have, so that the richer families could have their children, sons particularly, housed appropriately for their stature.”
Bathing suits were not mandatory attire when the Adams Pool opened in 1902. “People swam nude. Some girls would come and every so often, probably things would happen, although I wasn’t here to witness,” chuckles Palfrey. Swimming tests and races were conducted sans suits at the Adams Pool, where the only residents were male until the 1970s. Before the advent of waterproof synthetic fibers, swimming in the nude was considered more hygienic, and traditional fibers clogged the filtration system.
Rumors abound about the shenanigans that occurred in Adams, a house known for the artistic and progressive nature of its students. Stories range from innocent co-ed bathing to full-on, hormone-induced, drug-fueled sex orgies. “There are rumors of there being some foul-play going on,” hints Adams House Committee Co-Chair Kathryn G. Walsh ’14. “Too much romance in the pool.”
When the Adams Pool was officially closed in 1990, the infrastructure was showing its age. The water was often green, and the hidden jewel of the Gold Coast was losing its luster. The word among students was that the administration was fed-up with the debauchery in the pool, although the official reason was that the pool was simply too costly. “I think it became very expensive to maintain, because there were infrastructure issues. The question became, is this a luxury? A decision was made to convert it to a theater,” says Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Palfrey similarly notes that maintenance issues were a huge factor in the pool’s closing, citing a figure of $150,000—in the economy of the 1980s—as a ballpark figure in the pool’s renovation cost. However, there were larger reasons looming that were out of the control of the students, administrators, and even the largest of college endowments. “It was the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, and people were skittish about sexual activity happening in the pool,” reasons Palfrey.
Based on these factors, former Adams House Master Robert J. Kiely chose to close the pool. He wrote in an email, “It remained empty for a few years until our drama tutor Art Shettle and Superintendent Billy Long came up with a plan to install seats from an old lecture hall and turn it into a theater.  I heartily agreed, secured money  from the Dean of the College; and we had a grand opening with, of course, ‘La Cage Aux Folles.’”
Today, the Pool Theater is a venue for lectures, plays, musicals, movies, readings, and more. It’s still clear, however, that the theater was once designed for swimming. White, weathered tiles line the walls; a majestic, twisting double staircase tops the seating area; a bust of Neptune, a River God that freshman toast to with Rubinoff on Housing Day Eve, remains glaring at the audience from behind a black curtain. When the curtain is drawn and the lights are down, one feels transported to the Chamber of Secrets.
“Adams didn’t want to completely get rid of it, so they turned it into a drama theater,” says Walsh. “Adams left up pool signs to remind people of the actual pool that was there. Now it’s something that we use.” Walsh cites a fond memory of Adams residents watching a movie on a snowy winter’s night, while Palfrey remembers annual thesis shows.
“Things like that,” he notes. “All the way from academic, to literary, and to dramatic.”

When my mom called me at 3:12 p.m. this Monday, I was running late to class. “Oh, thank God, you’re not on the T,” she said as soon as I picked up. My stomach immediately sank, a few paces ahead of my brain.
“There were just two explosions at the finish line,” she rushed on, but at first I couldn’t understand. Where was the finish line, and how could it explode?
The night before, I’d told her I thought I would come back to our house so I could join the crowds outside to watch the Boston Marathon, like I have every year for as long as I can remember. From my house, only a couple blocks away from the race course on Commonwealth Ave. and around five miles from its finish, I could wake up to the excited buzz of onlookers, climbing even before the first racers passed by. Together with family and friends, I watched every third Monday in April as thousands of runners conquered the most difficult length of Boston’s historic race.
Heartbreak Hill is the final of the course’s hills, an incline that stretches over half a mile from Center Street to Hammond Street. The daunting slope begins around 20.5 miles into the race, the point at which runners are the most exhausted, maybe the least hopeful.
Imagine it: the minutes slowing down, the hill rising before you, that persistent throbbing in your calves almost at its limit. You committed to running 26.2 miles, more than the average body can handle, more foot-to-ground impact than we’re built for. You don’t realize how close you are to Boston proper, to the finish, until you make it to the top.
So at the bottom of Heartbreak Hill, the crowd goes crazy. It’s here where you make friends with strangers, admiring those you’ll never meet alongside those you don’t know. The middle aged woman with a visor that says, “For Donna.” Doctors and soldiers in full uniform. A teenager in a hot dog suit. The high school friends organizing fundraisers for their parents, who run every year.
From here until Boston, the city is one screaming mass pressed up against the sides of roads and food stands and around the finish line: grandparents in lawn chairs, children in strollers, college students with foam fingers, dogs.
We always gathered at the corner of Center and Comm. Ave., right at the base of the hill, our contribution to the effort. As the runners appeared, we on the sidelines saw gasping, slowing, stopping—and yet I never saw a runner pass by without attracting cheers.
To everyone who reached out an arm, we’d hand out water and gatorade, high fives, smiles—a celebration of Boston and its spirit. I remember thinking, as the synchronized footsteps rushed by, that I would one day run Boston—still do.
I wasn’t on the sidelines this year, but in the Quad: the green outside serene and still. After my mom’s call I ran back to Cabot, where my roommates were watching footage of the first explosion, right on Boylston Street, on repeat. I felt farther than I’ve ever been from the action, watching the runners collide with concrete, the crowds swerve to avoid the blow.
But I wasn’t that far: I recognized the buildings in the backdrop of chaos, the storefronts and streets that had instantly absorbed blood. This time all of Boston was running, not only the racers.
That’s my city, I thought clearly for the first time, as the footage rolled in and the tolls rose. Our city. I watched it shake and it shook us.
This was not New York in 2001, or Colorado and Connecticut in 2012; it’s Boston, where my little brother had a day off from school, where I had friends racing their way to the finish line, where those who felt shockwaves blow out the ground from under them had run by my house.
On Monday you could look at anyone and understand that what you were feeling, they felt too. Mile after mile, another test, another heartbreak—and so close to the finish, it seems.
It’s a collective insecurity: You can’t anticipate that in the span of 13 seconds, of two bombs, the city in which you’d grown up or the one where you go to school will be scrambled, rearranged. You don’t know if, or why, or when this could happen again. And you’re out of breath already.
One of my friends, who was the most visibly shaken on Monday, is not from Boston, but after we’d had enough news we sat in her room and tried not to cry. None of her friends had been affected, she said, and a small part of her felt that her reaction wasn’t warranted. That’s not true, and I told her so: We’re all a part of this place and what happens here, in some way. “This is the closest I’ve ever been to something like this,” she said.
We were lucky, of course; others weren’t. Some had just overcome 26.2 miles, others were stopped short less than minutes from their last. Some were watching from the sidelines, others were following through the cameras that those on the sidelines held.
Either way, that finish line was so close. We were all—still are—so damn close.
But I imagine that’s what the runners climbing alongside the cheering crowd, the ones who make it up Heartbreak Hill, think too.
 Delphine Rodrik ’14 is a History and Literature concentrator in Cabot House. Usually, she calls her mom first.

“What can I get you?” is a common and courteous way to welcome someone to a party. On Harvard’s campus, as on those of other colleges, alcohol is by all accounts accessible and abundant. A red Solo cup is a ubiquitous accessory to many social events. Yet despite the presence of alcohol on campus, a number of Harvard students choose not to drink. For many of these students, this decision is based on a variety of personal factors, all challenging the assumption that social life in college necessarily involves alcohol.
Students cite a number of reasons for their decision to abstain from alcohol. For many, foremost among these is the desire to remain in control. For Saad Amer ’16, alcohol is a tool many students use to loosen up—one that he doesn’t need. “I can do this without alcohol,” he says, referring to the interview. “I don’t want to impair myself. I see no benefit for it.”
Aaron N. Cheng ’15 describes himself as a relatively introverted person, but says he doesn’t want to rely on the effects of alcohol to make him “more social.” For Franchezka M. Loza ’15 (whose middle name, Margarita, she says jokingly, is itself an alcoholic drink), both the taste and the effects of alcohol are unappealing. In terms of the taste, Loza says, she doesn’t understand why some people “make themselves like it,” giving up some control over their bodies in the process.
Some students also refer to their upbringing and family as factors in their decisions not to drink. For Joshua R. Wortzel ’13, alcohol was not a substantial presence in his household while growing up; it was not “fetishized,” he says, or needed for social get-togethers.
Loza, who also says she doesn’t feel pressure from her family to either drink or abstain from doing so, cites her Christian faith as a reason for refraining from alcohol use. While her faith does not prohibit drinking, Loza feels that alcohol would make it harder to adhere to her vision of a Christian life.
“My Christian life is very important to me,” says Loza. Balancing school, work, and social life with her faith is hard enough, according to Loza, without throwing alcohol into the mix.
For some, abstinence from alcohol is less a values-based choice than a health-related one. “I have a health condition that essentially amplifies the effect of alcohol I might intake, and so as a health-conscious student I’ve never experimented with alcohol,” Cheng writes in an email to The Crimson. Nonetheless, even if he did not have a medical condition making the consumption of alcohol particularly dangerous, Cheng believes he wouldn’t drink. “Even without my medical condition, I can’t imagine myself ever really wanting to give alcohol a try,” he says.
Wortzel and Amer both acknowledge health concerns as additional reasons to abstain. A consideration of possible risks, they say, has factored into their own choices not to drink.
All of the students interviewed for this article emphasized their feeling that the choice to drink is a personal one, and their decision might not be right for every student. “After a stressful week, it may well be worth it for some to unwind with friends and let loose,” says Cheng, though he himself does not use alcohol to do so.
Loza also empathizes with reasons her classmates might drink. “Some like the freedom they get from being under the influence,” she says. With lowered inhibitions, she continues, they don’t have to worry about what others are thinking, and as result, might feel more honest, or perhaps even more “true to themselves.”  Yet, Loza says, she does not share the desire to use alcohol to lower her inhibitions.
Though some of the students interviewed for this article are under 21, none cited being underage as a reason why they don’t drink. Despite the wide availability of alcohol and the social nature of drinking, none of the students felt that pressure from others to drink was a significant problem they faced. According to Amer, an offer of alcohol in a social setting is more of a cultural norm and a kind gesture, rather than forceful pressure.
Some qualify these assertions of freedom from peer pressure, acknowledging that the people they socialize with are a self-selecting group. Wortzel credits his social group with creating an environment where he feels unpressured. Put simply, says Wortzel, “I don’t put myself in a place where I might feel out of place.”  Because he doesn’t drink, he says, he realizes that he may not have a full picture of the drinking scene at Harvard, or be completely aware of some of the problems associated with drinking.
Loza also feels that her friend group creates an environment that is supportive of her decision to abstain. A member of the Sabliere Society, a female final club, Loza says she has not felt pressure to drink at club events. “Girls in the Sab have been very supportive of my decision. No one has even questioned it,” she says. According to Loza, there are a handful of other club members who also abstain from drinking. Loza also feels that her choice to remain sober would allow her to look out for others if something went wrong at a social event.
For Amer, socializing shouldn’t depend on alcohol. From his perspective, a focus on social drinking may eclipse developing deeper friendships.
Cheng agrees.  “I have never found myself considering partying and drinking to be more fun than simply reading for pleasure or watching a movie with my blockmates,” he says.
Echoing this sentiment, Wortzel adds, “There are plenty of ways to socialize where drinking does not happen.”

It was a brilliant azure morning in early June when I stepped into the Latin Quarter with little more than a name and a metro stop to guide me. I had arrived two days earlier, and Paris still felt like a city of pure, overwhelming sensation. I drank in its sights and sounds with the eagerness of a newly hatched bird.
The morning passed in intense bursts of perception: the pungent smell of urine along the River Seine, the coolness in the shadows of the Hôtel de Ville, the confetti color of crowds before the Notre Dame cathedral. I was relearning, or finally learning, how to see, hear, feel, and taste. The day unfurled with the outstretched arms of an unhurried yawn. As morning became afternoon, the sun heated the air into haze. Out of this ether Shakespeare and Company first shimmered into being before me.
I fell headfirst through the rabbit-hole of this topsy-turvy, jumbled, alternate universe. Downstairs, a curved chandelier, dangling from the main bookstore’s wooden beams, cast an amber glow over the much-visited “Lost” and “Beat” collections. Visitors flocked to the store daily in search of the Lost Generation, tracing the footsteps of the Beats. Wedged in past the main counter, a tiny manned portal itself lined by books, were two narrow passageways. The passage on the left was marked, above, by an old fashioned clock and, on the raised step below, by a hand-painted sign, “Live for Humanity”—a memento mori and the meaning of life, together.
Weeks, months in Paris progressed in a waking sleep. As I wandered through the city, insensible to street names and landmarks, my imagination created a fertile dreamscape of sensory detail. My mind was hungry for these details and fed on everything around me—the gothic beauty of the nearby buildings, the caramel richness of sidewalk cafes, the beeps and screeches of pressed cars. I wriggled my way into streams of people, bursting at the seams of allies like rabbits out of a magician’s hat. Detaching myself from their flood, I would dive into side alleys and meander into further forking paths. A painted robot on the side of a building, a glint of glass and gold in a storefront window, a particularly beguiling trailing plant from a balcony—these peripheral flashes of treasure beckoned to me and I followed their call. To me they were talismans, amulets strung into a charm to delay the crumbling of the summer’s spell.
In this directionless wandering, I pictured myself walking right off the charted map, shrugging off the clutch of cartographer’s grids. I rarely knew where I was, or where I was going. I rejoiced in the stretch of the interstitial no man’s land between origin and eventual destination, breathing in suspended reality. I could float outside of time itself by cleaving to the flux of sight and sound. Each new piece of stimuli replaced another quickly. There were always new streets, new shops, new un-walked paths. There were crooked walkways to peer into, keyholes to brush curious hands over. The straight arrow of direction fractured into wavering luminescent threads that forged an imagined topography. To be lost is to invite possibility.  Paris by day was constant newness, constant discovery, and novelty from every angle. Those were intoxicating days, generous in their fertile soil that would spark a thousand more dreams.

If there’s anything Dean Hammonds has taught us, it’s that Harvard emails can end up in anybody’s hands. The Harvard Computer Society keeps archives of all College list-servs, including their names as well as the emails exchanged through them. Many of these archives are only accessible to members of the lists themselves, but plenty of them are wide open. Let that sink in for a moment. Remember that email full of Spider-Man gifs you sent across your dorm list freshman year? It’s accessible until the end of time. And that’s just the beginning of what FM found. We now know your secrets.

N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard professor most known for teaching Economics 10 and almost helping Mitt Romney win the 2012 Presidential Election, has one more achievement to add to his resume: being the world’s strongest man.
Participating in the World’s Strongest Man competition last week in California, Mankiw outlasted seven other challengers en route to a victory. Established in 1977, the event is an annual four-day contest that many fitness experts describe as the “most grueling” competition in the world.
Mankiw, a man well known for his academic accomplishments, acknowledged that his athletic success was improbable. “I get it—when people see me, they don’t see someone who should be spending all of his time in the gym,” Mankiw said. “Instead, they see a gifted intellectual who inspires social change among those around him.”
Mankiw’s victory was not without its suspense. Entering the last event of the competition—an airplane push across a 100 foot track—Mankiw found himself head-to-head with Zydrunas Savickas, last year’s winner. The competitors remained locked in a virtual dead heat until they reached the finish line, where replays show Mankiw barely prevailed.
“It turns out my neck crossed the finish line just before Big Z’s did,” Mankiw told The Crimson. Comfortable and at ease, Mankiw spoke with his signature poise. “Every day I thank Ryan Miller for punching me in fourth grade and giving me that neck.” He paused briefly. “And to think it’s only because I had a comparative advantage in getting girls.”
Mankiw went to extraordinary lengths to prepare for the event. After completing the grueling home workout routine P90X in 20 days, Mankiw set off to Kenya to train with world-renowned fitness guru Ibrahim Hussein, where he instantly became the country’s athletic sensation.
“I had trained before in places like Wiknam and Moldavia, but nothing compared to the treatment I received from the Kenyan people,” Mankiw said smiling. “And even better, no sign of that Kony guy.”
However, the honeymoon didn’t last long. Mankiw recalled a particularly uncomfortable moment he spent at a government fundraiser. “I joked to the President that my mile time was better than his country’s Gini Coefficient,” Mankiw said. “I was on the next flight back to the United States.”
Back in America, Mankiw hired David W. Johnson, the Ec 10 head preceptor, to carry on with his training. After the competition, Johnson’s involvement with Mankiw was briefly the cause of some controversy; Savickas, in his broken English, alleged that Johnson “did all of [Mankiw’s] work,” including competing in the “first, second, and third days of the event” for him. The accusations were later dropped mysteriously.
Mankiw, however, has no hard feelings. “I have the deepest respect for Zydrunas Savickas,” Mankiw said, “who, by the way, is an Ec 10 alum.” After being informed that Savickas didn’t take Ec 10 or even attend Harvard, Mankiw let out a rare display of emotion. “What do I know? I barely teach the class.”
Mankiw promises an even better performance next year. “My philosophy in life is that if things improve from year to year—even if they’re marginal—they’re worth attaining,” Mankiw paused. “Or at least that’s what I say about buying my textbook.”

The three of us rolled down Mass. Ave., maps in hand, surrounded by high school seniors. It didn’t matter that we had never applied to MIT and never would. It definitely didn’t matter that we were sophomores at Harvard; nothing was keeping us from MIT’s Campus Prefrosh Weekend, fondly titled CPW. We wanted free shit.
I went by Natalie Goldin, and after disregarding the persona Wolfgang Higginbottom from Luxembourg, my friends settled on the names Maxwell and Alex Vanserg III. We were banking on the assumption that no one would ask us any background information. Figuring out how to spell our names was complicated enough.
The CPW Schedule was literally a book, which is weird, because it wasn’t by Junot Diaz and I didn’t think MIT was too big on humanities. There were events ranging from underground capture the flag to laser parties to edible board games. Needless to say I went straight to the chainmail bracelet-making event.
The Activities Fair was overwhelming; we only had 30 minutes to load up on as much free candy and monogrammed rubber ducks as we could. After passing the pistol club, a group dedicated solely to tapioca, and another club that I assume was dedicated to giving out free lemonade at activities fairs, I somehow ended up at the Republican Club with a free Scott Brown water bottle in hand.
An MIT student cross-registered at Harvard told me he likes going to Harvard because we know more about politics and are “better dressed” than MIT students. He was right; no one reacted at all when I said that if I had been old enough, I would have voted for Obama over Scott Brown. I was also rocking the dinosaur t-shirt and unisex sweatshirt look.
The age gap made hitting on prefrosh awkward. I tried to make small talk with a group of students playing Quidditch on the field, but got distracted by another group of students going to a smoothie event, and then distracted again by a group of half-naked, mud-covered students who took us on a running tour of their residential house.
It was then, while I was sprinting through a room twice the size of my walk-through at Harvard, that I decided that I was transferring. Prefrosh weekend is just so much better at MIT, plus I want to see Macklemore.

UPDATED 4:39 p.m.
“This is literally the lamest,” a female Harvard student says peering over the computer screen. “Only Harvard kids would use a Google doc to get drugs.”
Like many of her peers, Ava, a senior at the College, spent her high school years racing toward a Crimson-colored finish line. “I was very Type A,” she remembers. “I didn’t experiment really with drugs at all. I guess I drank occasionally, but that was it.” And while some of her fellow matriculates felt paralyzed by Harvard’s ubiquity of excellence, Ava found the superlative level of achievement liberating. “Coming here, I felt like I had this freedom. For the first time, the pressure was off. I could figure out who I am and what I like to do.”
By the end of her freshman year, that revelation meant she was smoking weed regularly and orienting her social life accordingly. “I couldn’t smoke in my room, so I had to go out. I’d call a few friends, and they’d let their friends know.” The invitation was casual and inclusive, unlike much of Harvard’s closed-door drug scene, about which the majority of the College speculates more than it understands. “It was like, ‘Let’s pack a bowl and go to the river’,” she says. When Ava began dealing—“weed and occasionally molly or ecstasy, but mostly weed”—in her junior year, the people who accompanied her freshman year river runs quickly became clients.
Ava is not the first Harvard student to relish the autonomy that begins with high school graduation, although she may be one of the few who began dealing drugs as a result of it. For many, college presents both the resources to experiment as well as the opportunity to do so with virtual anonymity. Ava, like the other drug users in this story all of whose names have been changed, was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she did not want to be publicly linked with drugs.
Greg, a senior mathematics concentrator, also found college to be the ideal time to test drive the drugs about which he had previously only speculated. During his time here he has tried both weed and LSD and does not think his experiences are unique relative to other classmates.
“On the order of 75 percent of my friends have done drugs,” he estimates. Accurate data relating to drug use is notoriously hard to find, but the Harvard University Police Department recorded only three drug-related arrests on campus between the years 2009 and 2011. The disparity between hard facts and rumor concerning Harvard’s drug-using population points to the near impossibility of measuring the scope of drug use on a campus where contraband is more likely to be discussed than directly encountered.
Of course, within certain populations illegal substances are seemingly omnipresent. “If you ask the right questions, you’ll find out that a lot of people are doing drugs here,” Greg continues. “They just don’t talk about it as much as maybe they do at other schools.”
Why that’s the case is mostly a mystery to Greg, but he has his theories. According to Greg and others interviewed for this story, Harvard’s cohort of drug users is concentrated and strongly associated with a handful of social or extracurricular organizations—the Advocate, final clubs, the Dudley House Co-op. While untold numbers of people are doing drugs, a campus-wide fixation on the future makes frank conversations about them rare.
Drugs Should Be Heard, Not Seen
“He took you there?”“Yes! I’ve seen the coke room!”“You don’t know that it’s ‘the coke room,” says the one wearing a spangled dress. It looks like vulcanized rubber crossed with Caesar’s Palace. Her bathroom companion arches her eyebrows before responding. “It’s the coke room,” she says. “And everybody knows it.”
“I would say drugs are way more under the table here and also…kind of sensationalized,” says Ava. She pauses briefly to think of an illustrative example. “I roll my own cigarettes,” she begins—a fact she’ll later demonstrate before we eventually separate into the sunny afternoon. “So I went to a party at the Spee once, and I rolled a cigarette to smoke with a friend. The next week, I ran into one of the guys who was there, and he goes, ‘I heard you came to our party and rolled crack into your joint.’ Suddenly, it was like, ‘This girl’s a bad bitch!’ I thought it was so funny that I didn’t even bother to correct him.”
Even in this retelling of the anecdote, Ava rolls her eyes dramatically. “You can’t roll crack into a joint,” she says. “A rumor like that would never have gotten started at SUNY.”
For Ava, the narrative is representative of Harvard’s relative drug illiteracy—a condition only aggravated by the general student body’s combination of inexperience and omnipresent ambition. “So many people are so afraid of getting their hands dirty with drugs like weed or coke,” says Ava. “There is the sense that if you were caught, somebody could turn you in and that would really fuck things up for you here. [People] are much more willing to just get totally hammered or go out and buy Adderall.”
Harvard’s success-obsessed population plays a factor in James’s assessment of its drug culture as well. James is a sophomore at the College and a self-identified drug user. He first encountered addictive painkillers after sustaining a sports injury while attending a prestigious boarding school. By graduation, he was a habitual user, having experimented with coke, Molly, Adderall and Xanax.
James, echoing Ava, believes that Harvard students have a tendency to be tight-lipped about drug use or avoid drugs altogether, given that pursuing an illegal pastime could have negative effects on their lofty ambitions. “People feel like their future employers and employees, future co-workers or people who are going to help them in the real world go to Harvard,” he says. “It has people feeling that drugs could infringe on their future employment.”
Fear of the ramifications of indulging in illegal substances may contribute to a low level of self-reported drug use on campus. In the 2012 senior survey conducted by The Crimson, over half of the respondents claimed to have never tried marijuana, and more than 95 percent claimed to have never used “hard drugs,” such as  cocaine, or “study drugs,” such as Adderall.
Lecturer in economics Jeffrey A. Miron has written about the benefits of legalizing marijuana and argues against stigmatization of drug use. “I believe it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to use drugs, and that there is nothing inherently evil about using drugs,” Miron says.
Miron believes that the negative effects of drug use with which society should be concerned are those that affect others rather than the users themselves. “And I think most people, or certainly a large number of people accept that view for all sorts of other things,” he explains. “We don’t generally take the view that alcohol use per se is evil; broadly speaking, we take the view that driving under the influence is a bad thing, and we want to stop that—we use the law to stop that. But we recognize that when people use alcohol they might misuse alcohol, and that’s not a subject for criminal law.”
While fear of retribution almost certainly plays a role in some students’ decision to abstain, Zoe, a senior at the College who admits to using drugs but declined to comment on the specific drugs she has used, argues against the notion that “Type-A” Harvard students are unwilling to experiment. “In populations of intelligent people, there tends to be a lot of neuroses,” she says. “And people deal with those things in a lot of different ways. Maybe they want to smoke pot. Good for them—if they still get their work done.”
High Functioning
“Do you have an Adderall?” a student inquires. He’s standing with a friend on Mass. Ave., and one of the two is wearing a backpack.
“Sorry. I used my last one to power through this morning.”
“10 mg. or 20?” he presses, drawing out each syllable.
“20,” the friend replies.
“I remember my first 10,” the first muses.
His friend nods.“Sorry, man. Good luck.” “It’s okay. But Lamont without Adderall?” He groans. “That’s hell. That’s just pure hell.”
 
“I know my body,” James says later on, “and I just happen to be ridiculously high-functioning. I could do four bars of Xanax and be rolling on ecstasy while you had seven beers, and I’d probably be more fine than you.”
But James’ implicit assertion that drug use and high achievement can coexist runs contrary to prevalent stereotypes about drugs at Harvard. For Ava, marijuana’s unpopularity is consistent with what she perceives as the campus’s strictly defined priorities. “Weed doesn’t really have the reputation of being good for your studies,” she says, examining her fingernails.
Still, while marijuana use is not popularly associated with academic excellence, some Harvard students do seek out a different class of drugs in order to stay on top of a demanding workload.
Bennett, a senior English concentrator, first tried Adderall the summer before his sophomore year at the College. In what emerges as a sepia-toned memory, he and a few friends took the pills together. They stayed out talking on a nearby beach until 4 a.m.. The following semester, when a heavy course load and a bout of depression hit simultaneously, Bennett returned to the drug for academic purposes. “I had a really hard time getting through that work,” he recalls. “I had between 700 and 1,000 pages of reading a week.” The pressure was all consuming.
Bennett didn’t find it hard to procure the drug on campus, and when he needed a refill he sought out a friend rather than a doctor. “I don’t know many people here who have ADD, but I know a lot of people who have a prescription,” he says. “I think it’s easy to get. It’s pretty easy to convince someone that you need Adderall.”
After the fall semester concluded, Bennett continued to take the drug occasionally but with less frequency. “I don’t use it that often, but I think it’s been good for me as a way to deal with the academic demands here,” he says quietly. Bennett distinguishes his relatively infrequent Adderall use with “people who take it regularly basically to do all of their homework.” Still, he remains self-conscious about his dependence on a drug to deal with an academic course load that others seem to manage alone. Bennett believes that Harvard students are less likely to use Adderall than other college students: “I think most kids here are already pretty high-functioning, and so they wouldn’t need it.”
But Bennett’s private concern that he is one of only a few relying on Adderall to cope with his studies is called into question not only by oft-cited hearsay, but also by hard evidence. James claims that he frequently sees students taking Adderall in Lamont Library, and a 2011 survey conducted by the Boston Globe found that among an “informal sampling” of students at four Boston-area colleges, 15 percent had admitted to taking prescription drugs—most frequently Adderall—for stress relief, increased focus, and other unintended purposes.
The Social Network
 “I’d never do coke,” one says.
“Me neither,” the other replies, outlining her  mouth with a wine-colored pencil.
“But you should do Molly. Like, your life will change.”
“Yeah. I’d do Molly.”
Of the College’s general population of hardworking, perennially future-minded students, the number of people James would label as “social” is small. Within their ranks, the number he can identify as active drug users is even slighter. “I think kids will either go through Harvard and not try any drugs or kids will go through Harvard and try most things,” he says.
Zoe, however, disputes the idea that Harvard’s student body can be so easily divided. “I think not being willing to do anything versus being willing to do everything is a false dichotomy. I think there’s a lot more in the middle than you’d imagine. Harvard students aren’t trying to, like, shoot their brains.”
The Harvard Alcohol and Other Drug Services’s characterization of drugs, however, seems to minimize the presence of illegal substances on campus. In an email correspondence with The Crimson, the AODS identified alcohol as the Harvard student’s “drug of choice,” and stated that while “drug use does exist on campus,” it is concentrated primarily “in a small segment of the student population within subcultures of polysubstance users.”
Those members of what the AODS describes as a polysubstance subculture, according to James, comprise a somewhat motley crew. And despite—or perhaps because of—their scarcity, its members know each other fairly well. “I feel like I remember most of the people that I’ve ever smoked with,” muses Ava. Admittedly, the size of the university’s using population lends itself to a degree of transparency. “It’s a small community of people who smoke weed here,” Ava says.
At the very least, these students run into each other in the social spaces that exist outside of Harvard’s immediate purview. As Ava explains, “A party might get shut down in a dorm, but that’s not going to happen at the Spee or the Advocate.”
Zoe also points to certain locations that are associated with specific drugs. “If you’re going to eat mushrooms, then you’re going to go to Mount Auburn Cemetery,” she says. “And obviously final clubs—that’s where the coke happens.”
Zoe recounts recently confronting cocaine during a party at a final club.“I was waiting with my friend for the bathroom,” she explains, “and a line of five guys comes out of the bathroom, and they’re all, like, [sniffing] and putting away, like, their shit. You know what I mean? And you’re just like, all right, okay. I need to pee.”
Drug use cannot be confined to a litany of social organizations or spaces. Greg describes trying LSD for the first time outside of the College’s purview. When he recounts his experience  on acid, his voice slows and he mumbles, so it’s difficult to make out exactly what he’s saying. He begins the story over again a few times. In each protracted attempt, he repeats the word “beautiful” so often that it starts to sound a little bit like punctuation.
These are the facts: He bought a small supply with a friend. Together, they walked around the Business School’s campus for a while, and it was beautiful. It was “completely, completely beautiful.” Since then, he’s taken LSD on a single other occasion. “It was really nice,” he says. He’s silent for a while as he tries to articulate how it felt.
This is what he comes up with: “At one point, I had to cross the street, and it was just 100 percent of what I could handle. It was like I was full of this expanding bubble of joy, and I just had to hope I wouldn’t die. I was 95 percent sure I wasn’t going to die.”
Burnt Out
 She hugs her knees on the couch, taking a moment to rephrase.
“I know there are a lot of serious drug users at Harvard. But their stories overpower and shade the stories of kids who think they can do it all, and end up in a downward spiral. Some people can use drugs and be OK, but for others it’s debilitating.”
“I think drugs can innovate, and they can hurt,” James says. “It’s completely dependent on the way in which you utilize them. Yeah, there have been times when drugs have fucked me. I’ve quit drugs before. But that’s the thing: It’s taking a risk.”
With perhaps somewhat less bravado, Bennett also recognizes the element of danger inherent to drug use. “I’ve had some bad experiences,” he admits. “I was up for like 60 hours last year writing a long paper, and I couldn’t get to sleep, and by the end of it, it was really terrifying.”
Even in the absence of such immediate side effects, Bennett acknowledges the addictive capacity of drugs. “The effects seem to decrease the more you use it,” he observes. “You get inured to it, and it ceases to become a good tool.” He considers for a moment, and then shares his own sociological diagnosis: “I have a joke that people who need to do Adderall shouldn’t do it...People who have deeper issues that the drug couldn’t address were made more dysfunctional and neurotic because it.”
Margaret E. Crane ’14, the President of Harvard’s Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, emphasizes the downside of drug use in an email to The Crimson. “While the Harvard administration aims to respect our independence as intelligent young adults,” she writes, “Harvard’s policy for drugs reflects the fact that most drugs are illegal—largely because those drugs can be harmful to individual students’ health or to the safety of the community.”
And while Ava’s experience with drugs has been largely positive, she does admit that dealing introduced her to their less savory potential.
“I started dealing sort of by accident,” Ava says, recounting the day a friend told her he was trying to cut down on how much he was smoking. “He wanted to sell everything he had and then get out.” His clients—all Harvard students—were less than pleased. They’d been buying from one of their own for months. The pedigree made them feel safe. It made them feel comfortable. It made them buy more.
And so Ava’s decision to start dealing was not as much accidental as it was economic. If she started dealing herself, she could smoke for free. And so the business was born.
She began by buying an ounce of marijuana at a time from “some guy” who wasn’t affiliated with Harvard. She sold to Harvard students almost exclusively—“mostly just people that he used to sell to.” But sometimes Ava would get calls from friends or friends of friends asking for favors. Word of her small operation had traveled, and it didn’t hurt that she had swipe access.
“It’s easier to feel some camaraderie with somebody who is also a student,” she says of her former enterprise. In other words: It’s less sketchy than buying from a guy on a street corner. “I would go to people’s rooms and bring them their weed, and they appreciated it, because, you know, the idea of going off campus felt very unsafe.”
Ava stopped dealing in her junior year, but she’s continued to observe what she sees as a changing landscape of dealers and users ever since. From her perspective, more people are doing molly, but cocaine is as taboo as ever. Adderall is unappealing and “the harder stuff” is all but invisible.
“I’ve never seen cocaine,” confirms Greg. “But I know plenty of people have done coke or have a coke dealer’s number in their phone. To be honest, half of what I hear about cocaine is how expensive it is.” Still, he understands its allure. “Most of my friends, are keeping it together. But things are really hard. It seems like there are a lot of people, like, dealing with stuff—definitely more than they did in high school. People seem really complicated here, I guess I’ll say. Drugs are a way to deal with that.”
A Good Story
 “Wait, you have to tell me.”
“No, I really can’t.”
“Seriously, what happened upstairs?” 
Ava offers no directive when it comes to drugs. Smoking, she says, is obviously a personal decision. Still, as she reaches into her backpack and fishes out a freezer bag containing loose tobacco and a pack of rolling papers, she can’t quite keep the derision out of her voice: “Harvard students are above recreational drug use,” she observes, “because they’re above recreation.”
But while, according to Ava, Harvard students may consider themselves above drug experimentation, they remain as intrigued by it as any of their peers. Harvard, for all of its institutional grandeur, remains a relatively small school, and stories about drugs tend to be mythologized, maintaining more of a presence on campus than the substances themselves.
“This is a good story,” Ava says with a rueful smile. “A friend of mine used to do coke a lot. One day, he did some coke and he kind of blacked out. When he woke up, he was in his bed in his dorm room, and he had all these back issues of The Economist around him—open, highlighted and shit, surrounding him.” She wrinkles her nose and grins. “He’d read a dozen back issues of The Economist!” she says. “That’s Harvard on coke, I guess.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Harvard students are working to allow the blind and visually impaired to experience visual art by using 3D printing and audio components.
The project, named Midas Touch, has been developed as a part of the first Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge—a program sponsored by University Deans and hosted by the Harvard I-Lab to encourage students in “cultural entrepreneurship.”
The idea behind Midas Touch—organized by blockmates Aaron Perez ’15, Rishav Mukherji ’15, Vaios Triantafyllou ’15, and Constantine Tarabanis ’15—was inspired by a proposal for an Aesthetic and Interpretative Understanding 13: “Cultural Agents” final project, in which students were instructed to “create an artistic intervention.”
A teaching fellow for the course encouraged Triantafyllou and Tarabanis to enter the proposal into the Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge. With the addition of Perez and Mukherji, the group entered, and Midas Touch was chosen as one of 10 finalists out of 70 preliminary teams, according to Mukherji.
Working in the I-Lab and Harvard’s Microrobotics Laboratory, the team will use 3D printing technology to create a relief of artwork. When touched, a layer of pressure-activated sensors will relay audio feedback about the painting that will range from a description of the object’s physical qualities to details about its history and meaning via headphones. The first prototype, a relief of René Magritte’s “The Son of Man,” is currently in the works.
Mukherji said that adding audio notations to reliefs makes it a unique project.
“There are many artifacts out there which provide tactile reliefs for paintings,” he said. “But we don’t just give you the form, we also give you information along with it.”
For the Midas Touch team, social responsibility is a key concern.
With the extensive audio notations, Midas Touch believes the product has applications beyond use for the blind and visually impaired. The project organizers said they see a place for their reliefs in museums and other educational and cultural institutions, as well as in schools for the blind.
“Something that resonates among us is the fact that entrepreneurship is usually seen as something greedy or self-serving,” said Tarabinis. “But at the end of the day, you can see that you have a combination of entrepreneurship and technology solving a social issue.”
Tarabinis said the team is cautiously optimistic about its product.
“There’s always a barrier because this was created by people who have vision for people who don’t have vision,” he said. “We have our own limitations in terms of being able to create something effective.”
Midas Touch aims to solve this problem by inviting students from Perkins School for the Blind to a demonstration several days before the final round of the Dean’s Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge on May 9. The team hopes to improve the product based on feedback from the students.
Although Midas Touch is undecided about future plans for expansion, the team said that this venture has long-term potential. Even as the project is in its early stages, they have received press attention from various media outlets and attracted interest from individuals and organizations outside of Harvard.
“We believe this is a product which will become very viable in the future,” said Mukherji. Beyond paintings, the team hopes to apply its ideas to media such as maps, photographs, comics, and posters.
“We’re extending the arm of technology to embrace art,” said Perez. “That really hasn’t been heard of, at least from my end, and I think that’s really exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two and a half years of planning, the Digital Public Library of America website will go live on Thursday at noon, becoming the first national digital library in the world.
Initially conceived during a conference at Harvard in October 2010, the DPLA initiative has attracted experts from all over the country in a joint effort to provide open access to the historical and cultural heritage of the United States.
Starting Thursday, about two million items, including books, pictures, manuscripts, and other materials, will be available for free to the general public.
“Thursday will mark the end of what you could call the embryonic phase of the DPLA,” said Robert C. Darnton ’60, member of the DPLA board and Harvard University librarian. “We are [now] up and running as an organization with a legal existence and a highly professionalized staff.”
Following the Boston bombings on Marathon Monday, the DPLA board decided to cancel the celebrations for the virtual launch, which were scheduled for April 18 and 19 at the Boston Public Library. Darnton said that the decision came as a sign of respect for the victims of Monday’s bombing.
“It didn’t seem appropriate to us to celebrate something like the launch of the DPLA at a moment when everyone is dumbfounded by the tragedy of the explosions at the marathon,” he said.
According to Darnton, the ceremony was also postponed because it was not clear whether the Boston Public Library, which was closed to the public on Monday afternoon because of its proximity to the site of the bombings, will reopen on time.
“It’s important I think to have the launch in the Boston Public Library for symbolic reasons,” Darnton said. “This was the first public library in the country.”
In a message posted on Tuesday afternoon on the DPLA website, DPLA Executive Director Dan Cohen said that the launch event will be rescheduled for the fall.
“It was the right decision to make,” said Director of the Harvard Open Access Project Peter Suber, who was planning to attend the ceremony.
The Harvard library system, as one of the DPLA’s content hubs, will make some of its collections accessible to the public through the new digital library. The around two million items that will be available on Thursday, however, are just the beginning of a more extensive national library.
“From that core, the DPLA will grow and grow,” Darnton said.
In spite of Thursday’s launch, increasing the content of the digital library will be a challenge, said David D. Weinberger, member of the DPLA Technical Workstream and co-director of the Harvard Law Library Digital Lab.
Under the current copyright laws, the DPLA can only publish works 70 years past the author’s death, which makes the bulk of the twentieth century production still unavailable. The staff of the DPLA, however, is working to overcome this obstacle.
At a Harvard Innovation Lab workshop last week, Weinberger proposed a strategy called “library license,” which would encourage authors to loan their digitized copies of their work to local public libraries after they go out of print.
“We’re still pushing ahead with this proposal,” he said.
According to Darnton, the DPLA also hopes to create an “authors’ alliance” to encourage authors to give use of their copyright to the DPLA.
“That may sound hopelessly optimistic and even naive, but, in fact, I think it will work,” Darnton said.
“Most authors find that their books don’t sell after a short time,” he added. “At that point, what authors want more than anything else is to have readers.”
In spite of these obstacles, Suber said that the DPLA is a very promising project.
“[The DPLA] has a very realistic plan to take incremental steps toward accomplishing its ambitious goals,” Suber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting outside Cafe Gato Rojo on a chilly Monday night, Nina L. Hooper ’16 couldn’t help but contrast the light-polluted Cambridge night sky to what she observed in Arizona over spring break.
“Because you’re up on a mountain, the sky starts right in the horizon. You don’t have anything blocking you. You really have 180 degrees of sky. It’s much, much darker, and a lot brighter, so you realize how many stars there really are,” Hooper said.
Hooper is one of numerous undergraduates in Astronomy 100: “Methods of Observational Astronomy,” who went on the Department of Astronomy’s annual spring break trip to the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona.
The trip, which is an optional part of Astronomy 100, allows undergraduate students to work with Harvard Astronomy’s Supernova Forensics group to identify and learn more about the nature of supernovae, or stellar explosions. But more than supplementing students’ academic material, the course’s unique spring break trip gives students a glimpse into the lives of professional astronomers.
“It was exciting to have a very hands-on astronomy experience,” said Hooper, who plans to concentrate in astrophysics. “It was a cool experience to get a taste of what it might be like to be a real astronomer.”
CONTINUING RESEARCH
From the moment that they embark on the five-day trip, students are treated as fellow researchers responsible for doing fieldwork and gathering data.
Assistant professor of astronomy Alicia M. Soderberg, who taught Astro 100 last year, said that her students’ main responsibility during the spring break project was to help verify and classify any potential supernovae that might have been discovered.
“Part of the Astro 100 program is the opportunity to classify new supernova, and you just have to hope that there are going to be new supernova to classify,” said Soderberg, who led the 2012 spring break excursion.
Going down a list of objects that they were given to observe, Astro 100 students who went on the trip last year were able to verify the identity of a supernova within a few hours after its discovery.
A year later, Astro 100 students who went on the 2013 spring break trip continued with the previous group’s observations and found that the 2012 supernova, classified as SN2012au, was still shining brightly.
“We had instruments to know what type of supernova it is and whether or not it’s a supernova,” said Nuseir Yassin ’14, who was one of 14 students—out of the 17 enrolled in the class—who participated in this year’s spring break project.
Yassin said that the students collected and diffused light from certain celestial objects and used the resulting data to classify supernovae.
“Until someone does what the Astro 100 students did, it doesn’t get called a supernova,” said Maria R. Drout, a current teaching fellow for the course who helped lead the 2013 spring break trip. “All the time, amateurs and other people find things in the sky that they think are supernova...the only way you can know for sure is by taking a spectra of it.”
THE BIG FIND
The classification of SN2012au, a massive star that exploded 75 million years ago, revealed a connection between supernovae of a standard level of brightness and a group of so-called ‘super-luminous’ supernovae that are being discovered.
“A supernova like this one is starting to show us that perhaps there are deep connections between different kinds of supernova that have not been appreciated before,” said associate professor of astronomy Edo Berger, who is currently the head professor for Astro 100 and who led this year’s spring break trip. “It’s kind of like a missing link.”
In addition to continuing with data collection on SN2012au, students on this year’s trip also identified a new supernova. Berger said he hopes that this supernova, classified as 2013at, will lead to a tradition of discovering new supernovae every year.
“It seems like an annual thing,” said Rachel L. Jiang ’13, who felt that the 2013 trip greatly enhanced her experience in Astro 100. “I just had this sense of appreciation...I appreciated the class a lot more.”
A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE
Students echoed Jiang’s sentiments about the spring break aspect of Astro 100, which they said demonstrates the Astronomy department’s strong commitment to undergraduate education.
“It was nice because you can go from learning concepts straight out of the textbook to actually seeing them,” said Missy McIntosh ’16, who plans to concentrate in Astrophysics. “I really enjoy the real world part of it because when you go [to the observatory] you don’t just sit and work on a p-set.”
McIntosh said that this aspect of the trip made Astro 100 stand out from other classes that did not incorporate as much hands-on fieldwork.
“This is like ‘take this class and see what your job would be like,’” said McIntosh. “It was much more like trying out a career than trying out a class.”
Students said that they felt that the spring break trip represents a unique opportunity for undergraduates.
“[The trip] made me realize how many resources the Astro department was devoting to us,” said Jiang, who is pursuing a secondary field in Astrophysics.
Future astrophysics concentrator Ana-Maria Constantin ‘16 emphasized this strength of the Astrophysics department, which she said was the best of its kind in the United States.
“I don’t think there’s a field in astronomy that isn’t covered by astronomers at Harvard...Harvard has it all,” Constantin said.
She went on to compare Astro 100 to the popular Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” course, stating that the former deserves to be just as popular as the latter.
“People are always talking about how great CS50, which is very popular and everyone talks about it,” Constantin said, hinting that Astro 100 is more of a hidden gem among undergraduate courses.
Hooper contrasted Astro 100’s annual enrollment in past years, which hovered at around 4 to 5 students, to this year, in which 17 students are taking the class.
“Every year, more students are taking the class,” said Constantin. “That’s a good thing because more and more people are starting to be interested in astronomy.”
Hooper said that increased interest in Astro 100 and the unique benefits offered through the course’s spring break trip could result in continued growth for the Astrophysics concentration.’
“I think it has so much positive feedback that more and more students are taking [Astro 100],” Hooper said. “I think it’s a class at Harvard that convinces people to concentrate in Astro.”
Hooper said that she hopes that she and her colleagues in Astro 100 will contribute to the growing student interest in the course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Going nuts has never been better for you.
While nutritionists have questioned the healthiness of nuts due to their high fat content, a Harvard School of Public Health study published earlier this month correlates increased consumption of walnuts with reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes in women.
HSPH researcher An Pan led the research team of HSPH professors as they analyzed 10 years of data on walnut intake and incidences of Type II Diabetes in two cohorts of middle-aged women.
The researchers collected the data over the course of a 30-year study, known as Nurses’ Health Studies I and II, which monitored women’s diet and health. Although the study has gone on for three decades, the researchers only turned their attention to walnuts 10 years ago when more and more cases of Type 2 diabetes arose.
Previous analysis of the Nurses Health Studies had revealed a possible correlation between nuts and diabetes prevention, but Pan singled out walnuts as a strong candidate for reducing likelihood of Type 2 diabetes.
Excess nut consumption may “be of concern because of its high energy content,” Pan said.
However, even in the experimental subjects who ingested high quantities of walnuts, little to no weight gain was observed. Further research will investigate the effect of walnut intake on weight loss among its other positive effects.
“Some people have said the secret ingredient of walnuts is walnut,” said Frank B. Hu, one of the paper’s authors who is also a professor at HSPH. “Walnuts are packed with so many beneficial nutrients and bioactive compounds.”
This study is the latest in a crop of research that breaks from former views to uphold the nutritional benefits of nuts, including a recent report that links a nut-heavy “Mediterranean Diet” to decreased likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
Nuts, and walnuts especially, are rich in a certain kind of fatty acid, known as polyunsaturated fatty acids, or PUFAs, which are important for cognition and brain function. Due to the unusually high percentage of PUFAs, plant protein, fiber, minerals, and antioxidants in walnuts and the potential benefits of PUFAs in preventing diabetes, Pan zeroed in on walnuts over other varieties of tree nut. Still, he emphasizes that his results are correlative and not conclusive.
“At the moment, we cannot tell whether walnut is truly superior to other nuts, but generally speaking, including walnuts into our diet is a good choice,” Pan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to Harvard researchers, recent summer temperatures in certain northern regions of the world have been the hottest in more than 600 years, significantly higher than the mean temperatures predicted for a stationary climate.
The new results combined with previous studies linking carbon dioxide emissions to global warming provide further evidence to support the presence of anthropogenic, or man-made, climate change, according to Martin P. Tingley, a research associate in the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences and co-author of the study,
“I would hope that there’s already an urgency to act,” Tingley said. “I think we’ve done a very good job at formalizing some of these notions that recent years are unprecedented in a longer-term context.”
The paper, published last week in the journal Nature, showed not only that warm temperatures are increasing, but also that recent levels are unprecedented in history. By analyzing tree-rings, ice cores, and lake sediment records, Tingley and Earth and Planetary Sciences professor Peter J. Huybers, the other author of the study, reconstructed hypothetical climate histories for particular regions of the world and compared them to recent temperature extremes.
“Bayesian inference allows us to come up with many thousand possible realizations of the temperature history,” Tingley said. “And once you have four or five thousand equally likely temperature fields, you can say, ‘In how many of these realizations was 2011 the warmest year?’ And if that’s a very high number, we can say with confidence that these recent years are unprecedented in their warmth.”
Tingley and Huybers’ study provides a strong statistical foundation for the notion that recent temperature extremes exceed natural variability and stem from a dramatic change in the larger climate. Specifically, the researchers found that the 2010 summer was almost certainly the warmest in 600 years in western Russia, western Greenland, and the Canadian Arctic.
“To provide context with these recent extremes, it’s necessary to think about variability in both space and time, and to compare these recent extremes that occur in particular places to the overall variability of the system rather than focusing, say, on a time series for Moscow,” Tingley said.
While the study did support the notion that there has been a dramatic shift in the mean temperatures of these regions, the research showed no evidence that temperatures are becoming more variable over time. Recent temperature extremes can be explained by only an increase in the mean of the temperature distribution, which dramatically increases the probability of very hot temperatures.
“A scientist is always skeptical but we’re all open to reason,” Tingley said. “In my view, the evidence for an anthropogenic impact on the climate is overwhelming. This is not an issue that rational people doubt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A student-run website launched last week will connect sustainability projects on Harvard’s campus to potential donors, paving the way for green improvements to University facilities, including LED lights in the Quad and a new dishwasher for Cabot Cafe.
Through a grant from the University’s Sustainability Office, three Harvard affiliates—Seth Berger, student at the Extension School, Sachin Desai, third-year student at Harvard Law School, and Nicholas Morris, MBA candidate at Harvard Business School—developed Project Green Campus.
An idea conceived in Harvard’s Innovation Lab, an initiative in Allston designed to facilitate innovative entrepreneurship, Project Green Campus is a platform that will allow alumni, students, and other University affiliates to donate money that will then be used to fund environmentally friendly projects, from both the Sustainability Office’s backlogs and student-led initiatives.
Desai said that the idea of targeting young alumni is based off of initiatives that alumni started while students at Harvard. In 2008, the University pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent below 2006 levels by 2016.
“That generation of people who made the greenhouse gas reduction goal are today’s young alumni,” Desai said. “Now those people are in a perfect position to help support what they helped start in the first place which was Harvard trying to become a sustainable campus.”
Despite young alumni’s enthusiasm, Desai said that there are few outlets for their activism.
“There is no direct way that alumni can get involved. They can not invest—the divest approach—or they can go to the Sustainable Trace Fund,” Desai said. ”But this is something where they can learn about projects, see what’s happening and get more attached to it...If you’ve worked in this area before, it’s easy to get disillusioned and so this is something that is really appealing because you can make progress now.”
Project Green Campus has so far announced two specific efforts: the replacement of overhead lights in the Quad with new, energy-efficient LEDs and a dishwasher in Cabot Cafe designed to reduce water use. So far, as a pilot project, only the Quad lights endeavor has accepted donations—currently, a total of $400. That figure, according to the website, is around half of the project’s fundraising goal, which itself, Desai said, amounts to only about 1 percent of the project’s cost.
“We’re launching a pilot right now to get support, get feedback, and try to see if there’s enough interest in one of these projects,” he said.
Desai said that another purpose of the platform is to enable Harvard to tell its “sustainability story”, as the projects remain on the website once they have been funded.
“You could have a hundred projects—a hundred stories about sustainability at Harvard,” he said.
Colin B. Durrant, Harvard’s manager of sustainability communications, said that Project Green Campus fit into the Sustainability Office’s grant program’s goal of encouraging innovation that might otherwise be unable to receive funding. Durrant said that he could not disclose the exact amount of the grant, but noted that they are generally limited to $5000.
Durrant asaid that the Sustainability Office also facilitated partnerships between the project and other campus offices, such as the Harvard Alumni Alliance for the Environment and the University Facilities and Planning Offices.
Kate Konshnik, policy director of Harvard Law School’s Environmental Law Program said that the initiative allows for small contributions to add up.
“I think it’s more important to have a bunch of people give a little than one or two people give a lot because that’s the whole point of crowdsourcing—that anybody can participate and together all those little drops create an ocean,” said Konshnik.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard community convened in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Wednesday evening for a panel discussion on presidential leadership.
Four professors from Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School participated in the panel, whose discussion largely centered on Professor Joseph S. Nye Jr.’s new book, “Presidential Leadership and the Creation of the American Era.”
Nye himself participated in the discussion, along with Professors Nancy F. Koehn, Graham T. Allison ’62, and David Gergen, who moderated the event.
The event began with a broad, unanswered question: “Does it really matter who leaders are, or is history ultimately defined by the structure of the times that they are born into?”
As members of the audience pondered this question, the four professors entertained various counterfactuals in an effort to dissect the question.
“If Kennedy had been killed by Oswald two years earlier, we would have gone through the missile crisis with Johnson as president and would have most likely gone to war,” Allison said.
While Allison’s statement highlighted the importance of a single leader on the course of history, Koehn later stressed that presidential leadership is as much a function of structure as it is about individual agency.
“Structure and agency both create history. It is both the time and the person,” Koehn said. “Franklin Roosevelt was very constrained in the mid 30s and he didn’t know much about foreign policy. Only with Pearl Harbor could he put his foot on the pedal.”
Nye agreed that both the individual and the moment are important. He compared George Bush Sr.’s presidency to that of his son, referring to the elder Bush as having a high level of “contextual intelligence” because of the way he handled the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. On the other hand, Nye claimed, younger Bush lacked the contextual intelligence to properly carry out his mission in the Middle East.
Toward the end of the panel discussion, Koehn shared an experience she had in her lecture in light of Monday’s Boston Marathon attack.
Three students in her class, all of them of Middle Eastern origin, spoke about thousands of people who had been killed by terrorists attacks in their home countries in the past week.
Koehn said that these students’ stories made her realize the need for leadership that is redemptive.
She added that the solution lies in the realization that human suffering around the world is universal.
“I wait for Barack Obama or some of our other leaders to, as Abraham Lincoln did, call us to the better angels of our nature,” Koehn said before a thunderous applause from the audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a day marked by a flurry of conflicting media reports and few details from investigators, consensus emerged Wednesday evening that investigators had discovered footage that they believe may be useful in identifying the person or people responsible for Monday’s deadly blasts near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
Citing anonymous law enforcement sources, multiple media outlets reported that the video shows at least one man carrying and possibly dropping a black bag at the scene of the explosions. But investigators stayed mum, declining to confirm or deny the reports.
The only official word on the videos came from Dot Joyce, a spokesperson for Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who confirmed that law enforcement was examining footage from surveillance cameras at the department store Lord & Taylor on Boylston Street.
“The camera from Lord & Taylor is the best source of video so far,” she told the Boston Globe on Wednesday. “All I know is that they are making progress.”
When news of the video spread, media outlets raced to beat each other to the next breakthrough. False reports of an arrest swirled after CNN anchor John King reported at 1:45 p.m. that authorities had arrested a “dark-skinned male” in connection with the bombing. Some media outlets—including Fox News, the Associated Press, and the Boston Globe—reported that a suspect was in custody, while others—including NBC, ABC, and CBS—refused to confirm the reports.
“We can’t just flip a coin on this,” said NBC anchor Peter Williams. “At the end of the day, somebody is going to be right because every news organization is reporting something different.”
In the absence of confirmation, anchors began to back away from their initial reports, and the FBI firmly quashed the arrest rumor in a 2:50 p.m. press release.
But before the report of an arrest was shut down, throngs of journalists made their way to John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in South Boston, looking to catch a glimpse of the supposed suspect. Those who assembled were witness to a bomb scare, which was later deemed unfounded after authorities evacuated and searched the building.
Reporters then made their way to the Westin Copley Place Boston Hotel, where a briefing led by lead investigator and FBI Special Agent Richard DesLauriers, Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78, and Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis, had been scheduled for 4 p.m. The press conference was eventually cancelled after a series of delays.
Patrick was the only senior official to give more than brief on-the-record comment about the case on Wednesday. Talking with reporters outside the Westin in Copley Square, he sought to quell the rumor mill.
“You know there’s been a lot of chaos, and there’s been a lot of misinformation floating around,” he said. “I’ve been briefed on the investigation. There has not been an arrest. There is no one in custody. But the investigation continues to unfold, and they’re making progress.”
Thursday marks the third full day of the investigation. At 11 a.m., President Barack Obama will join Patrick, Menino, and many others at an interfaith service at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. Investigators have also said that they will brief the media on their progress, though it is in not clear where or when that conference is scheduled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2013, at 6:00 a.m.
Law enforcement officials said early Friday morning that they believe two suspects involved in a firefight with police in Watertown early Friday morning are the same two men suspected of Monday’s Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and injured 174.
One of those men has been shot and killed by law enforcement, officials said. As of press time, the other was armed and at large.
“We believe this to be a terrorist. We believe this to be a man who’s come here to kill people,” Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis said. He warned residents of Watertown to remain cautious and not to open their doors until the suspect is captured.
In an impromptu press conference convened shortly before 4:30 a.m. Friday morning, Massachusetts State Police Colonel Timothy P. Alben told reporters that a series of events that began Thursday evening with the murder of an MIT police officer may have led law enforcement officers to two men identified in surveillance footage from near the bombing sites.
In a statement released early Friday morning, the Cambridge Police Department wrote that they received a report around 10:20 p.m. Thursday that shots had been fired on the MIT campus. When they arrived on the scene at 10:30 p.m., CPD found an MIT officer with multiple gunshot wounds in his car. He was transported to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was declared dead, according to the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office.
CPD launched an immediate investigation and “determined that two males were involved in the shooting,” the statement said.
Cambridge police also received reports of an armed robbery at a 7-Eleven in Central Square at 10:30 p.m. Shortly thereafter, they said, an armed hijacking occurred around Third Street in Cambridge, when two male suspects held the owner of the car, a Mercedes SUV, at gunpoint. The car owner was released roughly a half hour later at a gas station off Memorial Drive.
When the stolen Mercedes was spotted in Watertown by police in that area, Alben said, a mass chase ensued as CPD, Massachusetts State Police, and the FBI joined the effort. It ultimately resulted in a firefight between law enforcement and the two suspects, who threw explosives and traded gunshots from their vehicle.
One suspect was shot and taken into custody in the East Watertown area. The other remained at large, and heavily armed, at press time. Davis would not confirm if the suspect was dead or alive. One MBTA Transit Police officer was shot an gunfire exchange and was believed to be alive as of press time early Friday.
Alben identified the suspect at large as the same man suspected of helping to carry out Monday’s bombing and seen wearing a white hat in surveillance video from the marathon. The “suspect in the white hat,” is thought to be a caucasian male with curly brown hair and wearing a grey-hooded sweatshirt. Officials said he should be considered to be heavily armed.
He added that police would begin a door-to-door, block-by-block to search of Watertown for the suspect. The Massachusetts State Police Bomb Squad was deployed early Friday as well, to search the area for any explosive devices, CPD said.
Though Faculty of Arts and Science spokesperson Jeff Neal said early Friday morning that no direct threat was ever posed to Harvard, students watched as dozens of police cars raced between Cambridge and Watertown. Many reported hearing gunshots from neighboring Watertown.
Throughout the night Harvard students banded together in support of each other, offering up their extra beds and couches to stranded students over House email lists.
As of press time, Harvard students had received eight MessageMe updates, starting at 11:33 p.m., alerting them to the situation on MIT’s campus and on Harvard’s campus. The most recent alerts, sent just before 5 a.m. Friday, warned students to avoid the Watertown area and emphasized that HUPD would continue its heightened level of security on campus.
MIT announced shortly after 5 a.m. Friday morning that it had cancelled Friday classes due to the death of a University police officer the night before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s lacrosse coach Chris Wojcik ’96 was not surprised when his team selected rising-senior defenseman Jason Gonos to lead the Crimson as its sole captain for the 2013 season.
“The coaches are not involved in picking captains,” Wojcik said. “But I think the team chose him because he is an outstanding person, he is immensely passionate about lacrosse, and he cares deeply about his teammates. He was the person they wanted to lead them in practice and on the field.”
Having a solo captain is somewhat unusual for a lacrosse team. Typically a team will field two or three captains, and Harvard had not had a solo captain since 2000.
TOP CLASS
This year, when the NCAA lacrosse finalists for the Senior CLASS Award were announced on April 3, Wojcik was again unsurprised to find his senior leader listed among the ten players chosen.
The award, which stands for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School, “honors the attributes of NCAA Division I senior student-athletes in four areas: community, classroom, character, and competition,” according to its website.
Finalists and award recipients are chosen through a combination of voting by NCAA Division I coaches, the media, and fans. Supporters can now vote for their favorite candidates by going to the Senior Class Award website until May 13.
“It is definitely a great honor and a very humbling experience,” Gonos said. “The credit really goes to everyone in my life who helped me along the way.”
ON THE FIELD
Gonos came to Harvard out of St. Mary’s Parish high school in Annapolis, Maryland. The No. 52 recruit in the country was looking to start right away for the Crimson.
“In the fall of my freshman year, I had slowly worked my way into the top three or four defensemen after playing in practice and in fall scrimmages,” Gonos said. “But I sustained an injury in our last fall team event which put me out of training all winter.”
“That injury was really disappointing,” he added. “I had probably gotten into the starting lineup before it happened, but I lost all that after the injury.”
Despite not starting initially for Harvard, Gonos did manage to earn some playing time in each game, which he used to try to earn a starting spot.
It didn’t take long. After only four games, the freshman started for the first time of his career against Colgate, and has been a fixture on the Crimson’s defense ever since.
In all but one of Harvard’s games since then, a senior-night in which Wojcik started all of the seniors for the first play, Gonos has suited up as a starter.
Over the course of his career, Gonos has gone through a metamorphosis, according to his coach, from the quiet but talented player who arrived on campus in 2009.
“I started coaching [Harvard] when Jason was a sophomore,” Wojcik said. “He was a starter then, but kind of a quiet, hard-working guy who would just do everything he could to do his job. Since then, I think he has really opened up and become much more of a vocal leader.”
This was a challenging but necessary transformation, according to Gonos.
“I’m a pretty quiet person,” he said. “And as a freshman, you’re very focused on yourself and trying to do everything you can to get yourself ready to help out the team. As a senior, I’ve learned that it’s not just about how you can get yourself ready to contribute. You’re responsible for getting everybody else on the team better too. I’ve tried to become more vocal and find more ways to get the freshmen involved in the game to make the whole team better, from the bottom to the top.”
One of the biggest challenges for the captain has been leading a team that relies heavily on its youth to win games.
The Crimson managed to land the nation’s fourth-best recruiting class this year, highlighted by the second- and fourth- highest ranked recruits in the country: defenseman Robert Duvnjak and attackman Devin Dwyer.
Both have excelled this year, as Dwyer leads the team in points and Duvnjak leads it in forced turnovers.
“Over the summer Jason sent out a letter to all of us,” Duvnjak said. “He explained what it was going to be like being on the team and really just tried to welcome all of us freshman in. I didn’t really know what was going on, but he sort of showed me around and taught me a lot. Jason is a great leader both for me personally and for the team.”
Coming into the season, expectations were high for both Gonos and his team. Gonos was named a preseason honorable mention All-American and has since helped Harvard’s defense hold opponents to 9.67 goals per game. The defender even scored his first career goal in the Crimson’s second game against Holy Cross.
“We have a new defensive system this year,” Gonos said. “But it’s one that we did my freshman year. A big thing for us has been trying to teach it to the younger guys, through watching film and working on our own outside of the scheduled practice with the coaches. We’ve been trying to get it to the point where it is more reacting rather than thinking, and that takes a lot of work.”
So far, Harvard is 6-6 overall and 2-2 in the Ivy League, a conference that boasts four teams ranked in the nation’s top 20.
“We have so many great leaders and players, and I knew I could rely on each and every one of them,” Gonos said.
“While I knew that I had a lot of responsibility as captain and I embraced that, it hasn’t been just me stepping up and leading this team, everyone has done their part.”
OFF THE FIELD
Lacrosse is not the only thing that characterizes the student-athletes chosen as finalists for the Senior CLASS Award. The award also recognizes players who excel in the classroom and in public service.
As a captain, Gonos has led his team in participating in multiple charity events in order to give back to the community.
This year, Harvard participated in the Mustache Madness program, a fundraiser that raises money for the HEADstrong Foundation, a lacrosse-oriented charity dedicated to blood cancer patients and survivors. Gonos and his teammates helped raise $6,979, the second most of any team in the country.
“Unfortunately, I’m kind of known for my inability to grow much facial hair,” Gonos joked. “So I personally wasn’t able to get much of a mustache, but our team got a lot of donations and it was awesome to help generate so much money for a great cause.”
Gonos also participated in a program called Metro Lacrosse that strives to teach inner-city Boston kids more about the game and help them with their academics at the same time.
“Our team has been involved with the program all four years that I’ve been here,” Gonos said. “I tutored a middle school student weekly…and this fall, we hosted camps for the kids and we provided them with gear. That was really important, because the gear is really the main thing that stops a lot of inner-city kids from playing lacrosse because it is so expensive. Our goal was to provide the kids with the gear and then help teach them the fundamentals of the sport.”
Gonos also participated in community service back in Maryland, helping out with a homeless aid group called Happy Helpers, and volunteer coaching for a youth lacrosse team.
In the classroom, Gonos has earned a 3.5 GPA. He will graduate this summer with a concentration in economics and a secondary in computer science.
According to Duvnjak, Gonos has been a helpful academic resource for his teammates.
“Jason really helps us all out,” Duvnjak said. “He is one of the smartest players on the team, and he does a great job helping all of us. As a freshman, you come in, maybe not quite ready for the academics of a place like Harvard, but he is always there to help you out if you have a question about a class or really anything at all.”

In his first bracket for 2013-14, ESPN Bracketologist Joe Lunardi has placed the Harvard men's basketball team as a 12 seed in the Southern region of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. The Crimson was a 14 seed in 2012, when it defeated the New Mexico Lobos in its first game before falling to the Arizona Wildcats in the round of 32. It was a 12 seed in the 2011 tournament, when it lost to fifth-seeded Vanderbilt in the round of 64.
Harvard is set to play Tennessee in the bracket. While the Volunteers missed out on the NCAA tournament in 2012, the team scored noteworthy victories over Final Four squad Wichita State and the Florida Gators, who made the Elite Eight. The squad went 9-3 in its last twelve games of the regular season and finished with a higher Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) than the Crimson did.
Next year, Harvard will return Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry as well as introduce class of 2017 freshman Zena Edsomowan. They have already been touted as a preseason top-25 team by ESPN's Jay Bilas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two sharpshooting lacrosse teams, it all came down to draw controls and ground balls.
Such was the lesson the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (2-10, 1-4 Ivy) learned as it fell at No. 18 Boston College (10-6, 3-2 ACC) on Wednesday afternoon, 13-12.
“When you’re being efficient with your shots you really need to come up with the draw and you need to limit your turnovers,” coach Lisa Miller said. “I thought both teams did a good job of that today.”
A grand total of 16 draw controls by the Crimson squad wasn’t quite enough to fend off a powerful Eagles attack unit, led by sophomore Covie Stanwick.
“The transition game was good,” Miller said. “We were really sticking our nose in and fighting it out for the ground balls and the draw controls.”
Stanwick, who is the seventh of her eight siblings to play Division One lacrosse, tied her career record with a game-high six goals. She has 51 goals this season.
“They’re crafty and they’re smart,” said Miller of the Stanwick family. “If you’re a little bit late, you miss a switch, you’re not quite on their angle, because it’s just in their blood and in their family, and they take advantage. If you play with someone like that everyone else tends to get a little bit sneakier.”
Harvard found its own offensive power in senior Nina Kucharczyk. Kucharczyk’s last second heroics nearly allowed the Crimson to tie the contest at 13-all. The midfielder had a team-high four goals, three unassisted and one off a free position attempt.
“I thought Nina started going to the cage really hard and we were moving a little bit faster off the ball to give her a little bit more room,” Miller said. “Overall, I thought it was a good effort on both sides of the ball.”
Kucharczyk often found herself closing the gap. Her first score, which came with just under four minutes left in the first half, tied the game 5-5, and her second brought the Crimson within one midway through the second frame, 9-8.
With two minutes left in the contest, Harvard was down three, 13-10, with possession in BC’s offensive zone. A foul on Eagles sophomore Mikaela Rix set up the Crimson attack unit for success, and Kucharczyk drilled the ball into the goal past BC goaltender Emily Mata.
Not even a minute later, the Harvard offense yet again controlled the ball, and Kucharczyk again found the back of the net. With just 42 seconds left to tick away in the game the score was 13-12.
With a man advantage from a yellow card on BC junior Moira Barry, junior midfielder Lauren Tomkinson secured a draw control that yet again allowed Kucharczyk to find the ball with hopes of tying the contest. This time would be different, however. Kucharczyk’s shot went wide of the post, and the Eagles took possession to sneak away with a win.
“Nina’s just so athletic and so fast,” captain Micaela Cyr said. “She can take pretty much anyone. She was getting open looks today and she was putting them away.”
Cyr, who is a midfielder, completed a hat trick herself with three goals, along with one assist, one ground ball and four draw controls.
Both the Crimson and the Eagles proved effective at moving the ball across the field, with Harvard perfect on all seven clear attempts and the Eagles failing at just one of eight tries.
“We’ve been working on the clear the entire year,” Cyr said. “I think we’ve been getting better at it. The past few games it’s definitely showing up now…. We’re just being more patient, being smarter about where we’re passing, and getting one turn out of the double.”
The loss is the sixth straight for the Crimson squad, which has just two games left in the regular season.

We spoke with University President Drew G. Faust and asked her what advice she would give to potential members of the Class of 2017.
On Harvard's Size:
"Harvard is a wonderfully large place, and that means that you have all kinds of opportunities that you can search out, that will be presented to you, but that requires a certain amount of entrepreneurship to make the most of, and that that's different from a tiny little college where the choices are not as numerous, they're more evident, there's more, kind of, bumping into those choices.
"I try to make that distinction about how those are different temperaments, perhaps, that would find one or another of those choices appealing. I try to also emphasize now how much of the University is available to undergraduates, through concentrations, like the regenerative biology one, or the new architecture field that's going to become a concentration, or Gen Ed courses taught by people from the Business School and the Ed School—so that set of intellectually rich opportunities."
On the House System:
"I talk a lot about the House system and how that's a special undergraduate experience that is very involving, and people might want to choose to go off to an institution where they can live in an apartment and not have to be bothered with it all. So I just think it it's important that they understand that Universities are different."
On Other Ivies:
"I think that I was well into my adult years as a professor in higher education before I understood the difference in size of different Ivy League schools, for example. You know they're all Ivy League schools, but Princeton is a lot smaller than Harvard, and Cornell is huge, and has all these additional schools of agriculture, and labor, and things like that."
On Harvard's Location:
"I also talk about where Harvard is. It's in an urban area, and that's different from some other choices. It has, in my view, great opportunities associated with it, but someone may feel differently and want to be in a more rural setting."
On This Year's Low Admissions Rate:
"I think it's very hard for the people in admissions to disappoint so many wonderfully qualified students who would bring so much to a community like this. We certainly haven't been trying to increase the number of applications just to have a huge number to report; there's no purpose in that. We're grateful that so many people are interested in Harvard, but it's really a tension and a struggle."

"First you get a survey and here's how it goes / Fill out it, tell the truth, we won't judge or disclose / And have a conversation on your drinking (pause) goals."
Okay, these rhymes might not be destined for immortality, or even for opening Yardfest. So what? DAPA knows you'll be there.
9 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. tomorrow: National Alcohol Screening Day in the MAC.
Time for our annual pilgrimage!
EDITOR'S NOTE: April 20, 2013, at 8:47 a.m.
 
This planned National Alcohol Screening Day event did not occur due to the fact that Harvard was on lockdown on Friday.
