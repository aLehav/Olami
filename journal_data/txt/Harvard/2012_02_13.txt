After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Office of Career Services plans to host themed “Career Weeks” showcasing professional opportunities in seven diverse career fields, including education, media, and public service.  Neither financial services nor management consulting—both fields that draw Harvard graduates in disproportionately high numbers—is featured in OCS’s itinerary. Despite this noteworthy improvement in the breadth of it’s offerings, many Harvard students find that visits to OCS leave much to be desired. While it is great to see OCS taking concrete steps to meet student demand for resources in a greater variety of fields, we urge the office to consider expanding and restructuring its services in order to provide more meaningful career development opportunities to students.
That Harvard undergraduates flock in such huge numbers to careers in finance and consulting can be attributed, at least in part, to the aggressive recruiting that occurs on our campus each year. A student at a Harvard career fair is unlikely to find a large variety of job or internship opportunities outside of finance and consulting because banks and consulting firms, unlike lower-budget institutions like nonprofit organizations or small publications, have the financial resources to travel to college campuses and print promotional materials. We encourage OCS to devise a system by which we may circumvent this unfortunate reality and bring representatives from a greater variety of fields to campus. One way to accomplish this might be to afford travel allowances to nonprofits that have had successful interns or employees from Harvard in the past.
Given that careers in sectors like investment banking and consulting are no longer as readily available to Harvard graduates as they once were, it is all the more imperative that OCS work to provide students with more varied options.
OCS can also help students find their own professional opportunities in a variety of sectors by overhauling Crimson Careers, the office’s online job and internship database. Crimson Careers is cluttered and cumbersome, and its odd job groupings—Nonprofit & Government, Engineering & Computer Science, Harvard Centers and Departments, and On-Campus Interviews (tacitly understood as the hiring process for careers in finance and consulting)—exclude many professional fields and belie the fact that the United States has a thriving, diverse private sector. Fortunately, Crimson Careers already has an enormous variety of professional opportunities in many fields, and making these opportunities accessible to students should only be a matter of redesigning the site.
The most important measure that FAS should take to demystify the job search and effectively aid students in developing their careers is to provide meaningful and personalized career counseling. Currently, students’ experiences at OCS resemble students’ experiences with a college counselor at a large public high school. Appointments at OCS usually consist of rushed resume or cover letter reviews; rarely is a student allowed the opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with a counselor who specializes in his or her field of interest. Harvard, an expensive private institution often billed as one of the top universities in the world, should not be providing such unsatisfactory career counseling to its students, particularly to its undergraduates, who are currently navigating a highly uncertain and heterogeneous job market.
The Office of Career Services should offer students more than mock interviews and cursory resume reviews. It seems that Harvard students are so apt to enter careers in financial services and management consulting because they are offered little assistance and encouragement in pursuing less established and prestigious career paths. Ultimately, long-term career development would not only enable OCS to tailor students’ job searches to their interests and talents, but it would also diminish the power of the most visible employers to recruit students who would perform better in different sectors, both for themselves and for the public good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As social movements go, Occupy Harvard could hardly have been more successful. It made headway toward all its main goals: making endowment investments more ethical, raising staff wages, and diminishing the power of on-campus interviewing for financial firms. Its leaders are now national figures. “When reading period is over, GS will still have Sandra Korn [’14, associate editorial chair] to contend with,” wrote the business blog Dealbreaker of Goldman Sachs’s decision to cancel an information session.
The amazing thing is that Occupy Harvard accomplished all of this without the support of the student body. In a Statistics 104 research project that yielded responses from one sixth of the College, students gave Occupy Harvard an average rating of 2.85 out of 10. Perhaps only the angriest students responded to this poll, but wider sentiment, expressed on sites like isawyouharvard.com and harvardfml.com was just as negative. “Who actually sleeps in those tents?” was a common question.
Nothing draws Harvard students like the smell of success, yet no one wanted to touch this national media darling. This school has entire courses devoted to social movements and even a strong social justice organization in the First-Year Urban Program. Yet the most relevant and important cause in a generation was met with widespread scorn.
Why is this? In Slate Dylan R. Matthews ’12, who is also a Crimson editorial columnist, suggested that it is because Harvard is made up of the one percent. In the Harvard Political Review, Josh B. Lipson ’14 suggested it is because “Harvard is not the bastion of radical leftism that second-rate social commentators describe.” I disagree with these views. The Harvard College Office of Admissions and Financial Aid says that around sixty percent of the student body receives financial aid, while that figure is around fifty percent at UC Berkeley, a school that embraced the Occupy movement in a much greater way. Moreover, although I wouldn’t call Harvard a bastion of radical leftism, it is a still a very liberal place. This is a college where pro-life posters get ripped off of bulletin boards with minimal reaction. Declaring that the poor deserve to be poor and the rich, rich would be a very controversial and unpopular sentiment to share at dinner.
Instead, the answer may lie in a decade-old article by New York Times columnist David Brooks. In 2001, Brooks set out to identify the distinguishing characteristics of the most accomplished of Princeton’s accomplished students. He returned dismayed; the students had breakneck schedules, could count the hours they slept on one hand, and had to schedule catch-up sessions with their best friends at dawn or dusk. In The Atlantic he wrote, “The young men and women of America's future elite work their laptops to the bone, rarely question authority, and happily accept their positions at the top of the heap as part of the natural order of life.”
I think this, in a nutshell, explains why the majority of Harvard undergraduates turned up their noses at the tents in the Yard. Harvard is a school made up of kids who sat in the first row of the class in grade school and probably ratted out those passing notes in the back. We got into Harvard by showing respect—nay, devotion—to social rules, and rebellion just isn’t in our blood. This is demonstrated by the careers students pursue post-Harvard. We jump from the arms of one established institution into those of another. We leave not just for Goldman and Bain but also for Teach for America, Stanford, The New York Times, and now the military. These organizations are places where we believe we can find mentors, networking opportunities, secure exit options, and all the other perks associated with joining a ship someone else has launched. Sure, there are exceptions—like Mark E. Zuckerberg—but these people are exceptions. Even those who say they are going to join a start-up after graduation are more likely to be joining a million-dollar investment featured in Wired magazine than a garage operation.
Obeying authority has brought us tremendous success in life, so it’s difficult to consider why this wouldn’t work for anyone in any situation.  Thus, students weren’t threatened by the ideas of Occupy Harvard—a Facebook status I saw read, “I support Occupy Wall Street unless Wall Street wants to give me a job”—as much as by its methods. Occupy Harvard sought change not through elaborate networks of emails, shared documents, year-long plans, and official sponsorships, but by screaming outside of Massachusetts Hall. It was so vulgar.
Although Harvard’s student body has gained tremendous diversity since our founding, we cling to a sense of social propriety that is downright antiquated. I am reminded of British soldiers reflecting on the American army during the revolutionary war. They didn’t march in lines! They crossed the Delaware on Christmas! Their general didn’t graduate from Sandhurst! They probably looked like a rag-tag bunch of tents, too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Drew G. Faust circulated a statement in which she referred to a new strategic direction and set of overarching goals for the Harvard Library, including an outline for an organizational design to support a more unified University-wide library system. As the Harvard community confronts this transition, the New Harvard Library Working Group of Occupy Harvard has acted autonomously to open a persistent community space for critical thought, engaged learning, and insistent action in the Lamont Library Café. In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning.
Over more than three centuries, Harvard has developed the nation’s, and indeed the world’s, preeminent university library. It is a global treasure and one of Harvard’s greatest assets. The work of transforming a collection of books into a thriving space for cultivating knowledge rests on the shoulders of the communities that work behind the scenes, at the carrels, and in the classrooms, often without due recognition. To move into the technological future, this exemplary institution deserves a radical re-imagining of the future of education, libraries, and thought—not just digitally enhanced card catalogues.
We think of the proposed Harvard library transition as a manifestation of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.
We insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement—on campuses and in public parks—not only possible but also fruitful. In Lamont Library, we are creating a community of knowledge sharing that is open, horizontal, and free from the destructive impulses that too often guide our university and that seem to be shaping the library transition. As our daily schedule attests, we will screen films, engage in the communal task of producing knowledge (skill-shares, tutoring, and, yes, we will read your paper drafts), meet for morning coffee and conversation, and host twice-daily "Think Tanks"—topical discussions in which participants enter as equals and where professors, students, and workers converse as peers.
As members of the Harvard community, we are committed to occupying the spaces of our education with integrity and intentionality. Lamont Library Café is an educational space specifically vested to facilitate the learning ideals of the University. We are doing no more and no less than striving to fulfill the promise of this space.
Indeed, it is because we love the libraries we cannot ignore the challenges they face. We must direct our resources more effectively to our academic priorities; we must re-imagine the nature and scope of services the Harvard libraries can provide digitally and embrace the possibilities inherent in new technologies; we must unite across the University to strengthen our collaborations and academic innovations; we must open our doors to other universities and to the greater public so that access to the thinking of centuries is not the privilege of a few, but integral to the bonds of our common humanity.
All of this involves change, and change is never easy. Our destination is compelling: We intend the Harvard libraries to be a preeminent university library of the 21st century. But that does not mean the path to that goal will always be clear or easy or noncontroversial. We accept this challenge. We occupy.
At a time when the University is restructuring the library, we will work to change what a library is understood to be. We seek to alter long-lived structures and arrangements, thus disturbing what may seem like short-term stability in service of much longer-term purposes. It is inevitable that we will need to make adjustments and revisions in initial goals and plans, that we will learn as we proceed. We will certainly encounter challenges—some that we foresee, others that we do not. But we must not be diverted from the goal before us: to make the change necessary to ensure that the treasure that is the Harvard Library, entrusted to us by the age that is past, is sustained in its excellence for the age that is waiting before us.
Join us. We seek your engagement, your understanding, and your support as we live into the possibilities of a new Harvard Library together.
Take a break. Think.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 13, 2012, at 4:47 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council released its first Annual Report to the College Monday to inform students of the UC’s activities over the past year.
The report details the Council’s successful campaigns for increased shuttle service from the Quad in the mornings and during holidays and more access to gender-neutral bathrooms, the deals and discounts in Harvard Square offered by the UC Restaurants program, and the creation of the Freshman Class Committee.
“The report was a chance for us to look back at the past year and think about what we’ve done,” said UC Secretary Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news editor.
George worked with former UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 to compile the report, which representatives voted unanimously to create in November.
“We tried to create a balance in this annual report,” George said. “We wanted a level of detail that would allow UC members to refer to it for future projects, but we also wanted a user-friendly format that would allow students to skim through it quickly.”
In addition to serving as a means of communication to current students and administrators, the report will help enhance the UC’s institutional memory, representatives said.
“The UC goes back more than thirty years, and it’s so important for us to know what past councils have done,” said Seth Riddley ’12, a Mather representative who was just appointed as the UC’s first historian. “The creation of an annual report will give future UC representatives better capacity to see things that have worked or haven’t worked in the past.”
Modeled on Princeton University’s 2010 Undergraduate Student Government Report, the UC’s 20-page document summarizes the work of its six committees over the course of the year.
“We asked Princeton student council representatives for tips on how to compile the report and how much should be written,” said Quincy representative Jen Q. Zhu ’14, who is also a Crimson photo editor. “It really helped us streamline the process and find the best practices to get this report together.”
UC representatives said they also looked to the Yale College Council for inspiration. That body recently launched a website asking “What has the YCC done this year?” to document its achievements on an online platform.
UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 said that the UC plans to create a similar website.
“We know that Harvard students are busy,” Yalamanchi said. “The website update is a quick, entertaining feature that will hopefully engage those who don’t have the time or interest to read our full annual report.”

The College’s alcohol policy committee has created an online forum to gather student opinions for its ongoing revision of the College’s alcohol policy.
After focus groups held by the committee last semester saw low attendance, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson sent an email to the student body on Feb. 8 with a link to an online alcohol policy comment box. The survey, which is accessible only after a student logs in with a Harvard ID number, includes six open-ended questions.
The questions include, “What philosophy and values should guide the development of a College alcohol policy?” and “How might we empower students to actively create a unique and transformative vision for socializing and interacting with each other in a safe and healthy way?”
Students who were unable to attend the seven focus group meetings or felt uncomfortable discussing their views in person can utilize the online comment box, Cabot House Master and Alcohol Policy Committee Chair Rakesh Khurana said.
“This will allow the student voice to drive the direction of the policies,” said Hilary A. Hayssen ’13, a member of the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors Community and Education Outreach subcommittee.
The College’s initial attempt to solicit student perspectives attracted a disappointing total of 70 students, tutors, and proctors over the course of the meetings in seven locations across campus. Most of the student participants were DAPA members, Undergraduate Council representatives, and House Committee members.
“There was a selection bias of students interested in talking about alcohol,” Nelson said, adding that she hopes the website will elicit a more comprehensive poll of the student body.
Last fall, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, who formed the committee, allotted funds to the Houses and Yard to support alternative programming on weekend nights.
The events included concerts, dances, and movie screenings.
“All those things go hand-in-hand with the over-arching theme of healthy, safe, fun socializing on campus,” Nelson said.
The number of students who have completed the survey thus far was unavailable.
Hayssen said that she hoped students take the time to respond.
“Like anything else, there will be some who do not participate, but I hope people recognize the opportunity to contribute and take advantage of it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students packed into the Quincy Junior Common Room on Sunday to watch the debut of a Harvard “It Gets Better” video, a montage of students sharing their stories about growing up as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer youths.
The video is patterned after the national “It Gets Better Project,” which was launched in 2010 after a series of suicides of gay teens. The project releases videos to encourage LGBTQ youths to believe in their potential for happiness as adults.
In the Harvard video, LBGTQ students describe their often difficult
experiences discovering their sexual dentities and coming out to their family and friends. The video ends with a message of hope, as each student recounts his or her inspiration for moving forward.
The student who spearheaded the Harvard project, a junior in Quincy House who asked to remain anonymous because he has not yet come out to his family, said his own experience coming out at school last year inspired him to create a Harvard “It Gets Better” video.
“I’ve always remembered feeling pressure and thinking to myself, ‘There must be so many other people here with that same mentality,’” he said.
The Quincy junior said he met with administrators early last November to discuss his project’s potential affiliation with the University. Eventually, he said he chose to forgo an official University endorsement so that the video could apply to all teens, not only to those who end up at Harvard.
After sending out emails to House lists to find students willing to share their stories, the organizer shot the video with a group of students during Wintersession, with funding from the Undergraduate Council.
Schools including the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Yale Divinity School, and Princeton have created similar videos.
“We didn’t have anything like this on campus,” said Scott O. Ahlborn ’12, who helped produce the Harvard video. “This movie had the ability to send a message that people from all different backgrounds and different areas could talk about issues of sexuality and gender in a comfortable space.”
Sophy T. Lee ’12 said she decided to participate because of the impact that other It Gets Better videos had on her own experience coming out. Lee said that the video can apply to anybody who feels different or judged, regardless of sexuality.
“No matter what or who you are, you’re not alone.” Lee said. “Once you reach out, you’ll be shocked by how much people are willing to help.”
The Quincy junior said that he hopes Lady Gaga will watch the video when she comes to Sanders Theatre later this month to launch her anti-bullying effort, the Born This Way Foundation.
“I just hope that people know that they aren’t alone,” he said. “If I can help one person, it would mean the world to me.”

CORRECTION: Feb. 13, 2012.

As part of a push to make greater use of technology, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ registrar’s office is in the initial phase of creating an online portal for teachers to enter midterm grades and another web page for students to access their unofficial transcripts.
FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke said he hopes to see both systems online as early as next fall.
Burke said the transition from paper to an online platform for submitting midterm grades will help struggling students obtain help earlier in the semester.
“I think the overriding vision for it is to make it easier for faculty to notify students and advisers or resident deans about students’ progress,” Burke said.
The project comes a year and a half after Burke’s predecessor Barry S. Kane told The Crimson in July 2010 when he left to work at Wellesley that his biggest regret was not introducing an electronic method for midterm grade submission during his time as registrar.
Currently, the registrar is the middleman who connects faculty concerned about students’ poor performance with those students’ resident deans.
“The current paper system is slow, so [advisers] often don’t get information in time to be helpful,” Ryan M. Spoering, a chemistry and chemical biology lecturer, wrote in an email. “An online system would be a clear improvement in speed and would also be easier for course staff to complete and submit.”
The system has not been designed yet, and Burke said that his office has not determined whether students will be able to view their own midterm grades or overall course progress through the online system.
Under the current paper-based process, the registrar sends out what Burke called a “mass mailing” of class rosters and grading forms, asking faculty members to report back on students’ progress mid-semester. The registrar then scans the grade sheets and notifies the resident deans of struggling students in their Houses and dorms.
With the new system in place, faculty would be able to more efficiently point out students who scored poorly on a midterm examination or were not completing coursework, Burke said.
Daniel E. Lieberman ’86,  a professor of human evolutionary biology, wrote in an email, “I often find midterm grades to be important for helping identify students that need some help or support, so if we can improve the system that would be good for everyone.”
Samuel F. Himel ’12, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, said that the proposed system “doesn’t fix the whole issue, but it’s a great step.”
Himel said he thinks the College can better serve struggling students by moving back the add/drop and withdrawal deadlines as well as giving students more graded feedback early in the term while they still have the option of adding and dropping classes.
The registrar’s office is also working to give students online access to unofficial versions of their transcripts. The new unofficial transcripts will include full course titles rather than the abbreviated listings found on the student records which are now viewable online.
“We’re focused on providing the resources for students that make it easier for them to get on with learning,” Burke said.
Himel praised that planned upgrade, saying, “I’ve always thought how silly it is that the only thing you can get at 11 at night when you pop in a job application is this transcript that has letters and symbols and numbers [the Student Record] that don’t mean anything to anyone outside of Harvard.”
Himel added, “It would be a great idea to have a more complete and informative document available.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past week,  New York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin ’10 has climbed from the brink of unemployment to international stardom—generating a new wave of enthusiasm for the former Crimson star on campus.
“It’s surreal,” William E. Eger ’12 said. “It’s fun to see him tear it up in the [National Basketball Association]. You would never have expected that.”
On Friday, the former economics concentrator tallied 38 points in a win against Los Angeles Lakers. Starting for only the third time in his professional career, Lin outscored Laker Kobe Bryant, a 14-time league all-star.
Eger and a half dozen friends gathered Friday in his Winthrop dorm room to cheer on the Harvard alum.
“To me it’s unbelievable to see anyone, any sort of Harvard athlete excel at the same level as he’s succeeded,” Eger said. “He’s the most successful Harvard athlete of all time—one of the most successful, at least.”
Lin’s streak started in a Feb. 4 matchup with the New Jersey Nets, during which Lin tallied 25 points after coming off the bench. Lin’s surprising performance inspired the New York Daily News to headline its game recap with “It’s LinSanity!” and earned the Harvard graduate a starting spot in a game against the Jazz two nights later.
Several students said they watched the Knicks game as if they were cheering on the Crimson.
“[Watching the Knicks game] was like watching a Harvard game,” said Ian Chang ’14, who had watched Lin on occasion in the past year but has followed the Harvard alum much more closely in the past week. “You are still cheering because of the Harvard connection.”
Lin is only the third Harvard athlete to make it to the National Basketball Association, and the first in over fifty years. In only his second season, he has tied the record for most games played by a Harvard alum at 43.
“I think it kind of puts Harvard sports on the map in a way that we haven’t been able to do previously,” Jeremy D. Mudd ’12 said. “It gives us a degree of credibility in the sports world that we might not have had before.”
When Lin entered the NBA after graduating in 2010, experts did not expect Lin to succeed in the professional arena. Lin went undrafted and was then cut twice before joining the Knicks. During his senior year, Lin, team co-captain and starting guard, led the Crimson to its best record in the program’s history.
“I’ve been incredibly surprised,” Mudd said. “We all knew he was a great player in college, but it’s one thing to be a great player in the Ivy League, and another thing entirely to be scoring 38 points against the Lakers.”

The value of Harvard’s U.S.-traded equities rose by 14 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 as U.S. markets continue to recover from the financial crisis, according to the University’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission Friday.
Harvard’s U.S.-traded stocks slightly outperformed both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor’s 500 indices, which rose by about 12 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively, in the same period. In the last quarter, the University has shuffled the apportionment of its equity holdings.
The total value of Harvard’s U.S. traded equities rose to $1.05 billion in the first quarter of the fiscal year from about $921 million in the previous quarter, representing a reversal—if slight—of a recent declining trend in the value of Harvard’s U.S. stocks. The current value of these investments is slightly lower than the value at the same time last year.
The report reveals that over half of Harvard’s U.S. stocks are exposed to emerging markets. The largest of these investments, comprising over a quarter of the value of Harvard’s U.S. stocks at $294 million, is in a fund that tracks the performance of Brazil. Harvard’s investments in instruments that track the health of sovereign economies are clustered among Brazil, Russia, India, and China—the so-called “BRIC” nations—in addition to holdings in other South Asian and Latin American countries.
As in years past, Harvard’s investments also show a marked trend toward the energy, natural resources, and telecommunications industries in Latin America.
The filings reveal that in the last quarter, Harvard shed many of its investments in gold and gold mining companies. Since the last quarter, the University has divested from gold mining companies, such as AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd.. Over the past year, gold prices reached historic highs, but some expert have expressed doubts that these price level will persist.
This move could also reflect a growing sentiment that U.S. markets are recovering from the downturn, as gold is traditionally viewed as a hedge against financial uncertainty.
The filings also show increased investment in the technology industry. Of the 11 new investments made this quarter, seven of are in technology-related companies, and many operate in China, including Yucheng Technologies Ltd and Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd.
In addition, Harvard recently bought over half of the global IT company SuccessFactors, Inc., which provides cloud-based “business execution” software, according to the company’s website.
Since the onset of the financial crisis, Harvard has seen a sharp decrease in the value of its U.S. stocks. Between the fourth quarter of FY2008 and the first quarter of FY2009, the value of Harvard’s U.S. stocks decreased by over 75 percent—from $2.88 billion to $571 million—as the market crashed and investors at the Harvard Management Company sought safer investments. The value of these investments was as high as $4.17 billion in 2007.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 80 students from 18 college campuses around the Boston area gathered on Sunday for the Occupy Boston Student Summit held in Emerson Hall.
Occupy Harvard hosted the Boston-wide meeting that was organized by various Occupy groups to nurture a cohesive community and to create plans for coordinated action among the different student Occupy groups.
“We’re taking a step back so that everyone would be on the same page on issues,” said Amanda Achin, a student from the University of Massachusetts Boston. “Also, we want to take a step forward together, while growing the number of students involved.”
Through “Identity Breakout groups,” organizers attempted to foster connections between different student Occupy Groups. The three identity groups—feminists, people of color, and LGBTQ advocates—connected over common issues they believe Occupy can fight for in the future.
“We want people to identify with something to build support in the community and organize around issues we care about,” said Meg Lazar, a student from Northeastern University. “It’s important to have these kinds of meetings and exercises to create not just a movement but also a community that cares about where it’s going and what its future is.”
The Occupy student groups also set two dates for future protests. They planned the Higher Education Day of Action, which will be Mar. 1, and Mayday on May 1.
The Higher Education Day of Action is a two-hour rally that will protest the cuts in higher education, as well as banking institutions taking advantage of student debts. The tentative locations for this protest are the Massachusetts State House and banking institutions around the Boston area.
“We are going to institutions that failed us from an educational standpoint, institutions that benefit from privatization of education,” Lazar said. “Also, some part of the March for Education is for reminding people of the values of education...something people tend to forget.”
Plans for Mayday have not yet been set, although the national Occupy movement is calling for general strike, student walkouts, and a protest of the G8 NATO summit that will be held in Chicago.
Other issues raised during the summit included discussions on student debt and education inequality, causes that Occupy hopes to address.
“We wanted to talk about different issues that students are affected by and figure out how we’ll organize ourselves to get reform, whether it’s student debt forgiveness or addressing the privatization of education,” said Chris Morrill, a student from the University of Massachusetts Boston.
MIT professor Noam Chomsky led a panel discussion on the problems with the current education system, as well as how the student Occupy groups fit into the Occupy movement as a whole.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 13, 2012, at 6:59 p.m.
The University will offer a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program to library employees 55 years and older with 10 years of service under their belts, according to a University spokesperson.
Those who choose to accept the offer will receive six months’ pay, plus two additional weeks’ pay for every year of employment beyond 10 years. An employee cannot receive more than one year’s worth of salary under the package.
Approximately 275 employees are eligible for the plan. There are 930 full-time employees within the University library system.
Once they receive the details of their personal plan, workers will have 46 calendar days to decide whether or not to accept it.
Workers were informed of the program via email early afternoon Monday.
The plan is part of an ongoing restructuring of the University library system, which seeks unify Harvard’s 73 currently independent libraries.
Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton had previously said at a town hall meeting with library employees that “the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
In an email to the Crimson, a university spokesperson said that with improvement to the library system in mind, “the University is implementing a generous, voluntary early retirement program that will both offer incentives to qualifying employees who wish to retire and help the library meet the needs of its new organization.”
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said the offer was just another ambiguous message from the administration in a process that it has not handled well.
“It’s one more step that seems premature and that is poorly considered and not broadly enough consulted about,” Jaeger said. “There’s a record-breaking level of turmoil and anxiety among the staff. This just adds to the confusion.”
Jaeger said that this announcement did nothing to address the fact that, according to HUCTW member, the library is understaffed as it is.
“At this point, the case hasn’t been made for staff reductions,” Jaeger said. He added that if the library does not have a solid plan going forward, this program could cause it to lose money.
He also said that the possibility of a Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program was never mentioned in discussions between the union and the library.
“It’s really hard for the library staff to know what to make of the early retirement offer,” Jaeger said. “The big question that crowds out all the others is, ‘Why?’”
Karen L. O’Brien, a library assistant who noted that she was too young to take the offer, said that she thought that the announcement mirrored the steps the library took in the past when it sought staff reductions. O’Brien said she thought that more employees were likely to accept the early retirement program if they had been previously scared by the threat of layoffs.
Since Shenton’s announcement, some library employees have taken to the streets to protest the possibility of layoffs, picketing outside of a meeting for library staff members and staging multiple public demonstrations.
Sunday night, members of Occupy Harvard took over Lamont Library Café, pledging to stay in the café until 10 p.m. on Friday in order to protest library staff reductions.
The University has said it will provide more information on staff reductions over the coming weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team left Princeton’s Jadwin Gym with a win, most of the Crimson’s players had not yet been born. The Tigers’ impressive home winning streak against Harvard—its longest against Ivy foe—dates back to Feb. 3, 1989, when Harvard earned a 63-57 victory at Princeton’s home court.
And last night’s matchup ended no differently than that the last few decades of games at Jadwin, as the Tigers added their 23rd straight win to its streak against the Crimson (21-3, 7-1 Ivy) with a 70-62 victory Saturday night. With the win, Princeton (13-10, 4-3) snapped Harvard’s nine-game winning streak and also handed the Crimson its first loss in Ivy play.
“[Princeton has] been very good obviously through the couple years we’ve played them,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Princeton has always had a pretty darn good way of playing here, no question about it.”
Last year, the Crimson and the Tigers—who both earned shares of the Ancient Eight title—also split games in the regular-season series, with both teams grabbing wins on their home courts. The Tigers had Harvard’s number again in the teams’ final matchup of the year, a playoff game to determine the Ivy League’s representative in the NCAA Tournament.
“We don’t look to the past for motivation,” Princeton junior Ian Hummer said. “They’re in our league…and we want to knock them off and play as hard as we could. That’s motivation enough.”
Despite the loss on Saturday, the Crimson still holds the top spot in conference play, as every other team has dropped at least two games so far.
A TALE OF TWO HALVES
Although Harvard entered halftime with a five-point edge over the Tigers, Princeton exploded in the second half, scoring 48 second-half points on 62.5 percent shooting from the field—a full 24 percentage points better than the team’s first-half performance.
“We were able to really be successful with that, throwing it inside, finding some mismatches,” sophomore T.J. Bray said. “On defense, that’s where everything starts. If you get stops, everything is so much more wide open.”
The Tigers made eight of their final 10 shots, outscoring the Crimson, 24-18, in the last six minutes of the game. And the Princeton bench in particular came through late in the game, producing more than its Harvard counterparts, 15-0, in the second half.
“They had a momentum stretch that we certainly couldn’t get them out of,” Amaker said. “I thought they got the ball up the floor pretty quick a couple of times and had us on our heels.”
Although Princeton shot an unimpressive five of nine from the free-throw line for the first 37 minutes of Saturday’s contest, the Tigers fared much better as the game neared its end. In the final three minutes, Princeton went 12 for 15 from the line to cement its lead over a Crimson team forced to foul to stop the clock.
Harvard didn’t attempt a free throw until the second half and couldn’t make them count, shooting 7 for 11 on the night. All four misses came from junior forward Kyle Casey, who went one of five from the stripe.
KILLER CONTRIBUTIONS
Before Saturday’s contest at Jadwin, Harvard possessed the nation’s third-best scoring defense, holding its opponents to an average of 53.6 points per game. But thanks to a 48-point Tiger second half, the Crimson allowed 70 total points, matching the most Harvard has allowed all season.
The only other team to put up as many points against the Crimson so far this season was Seattle, which lost an offensive shootout, 80-70, at Lavietes earlier this year.
Princeton has Hummer to thank for most of the Tigers’ offensive prowess. The forward finished with 20 points against the Crimson, including 13 in the second half, to lead all players last night.
But perhaps the most surprising big-time contributor for the Tigers was junior Brendan Connolly, who matched up against Harvard co-captain Keith Wright in the post.
“We got some quality minutes from Brendan Connolly,” Princeton coach Mitch Henderson said. “I thought Brendan really established a swagger for us early which we needed…. [Connolly] presented a really nice matchup for us with Keith Wright.”
Connolly earned just his seventh start of the season Saturday night and was one of three Tigers—with Hummer and Bray—who scored in double digits. Connolly picked up six rebounds, including two offensive boards, and also added one assist to his 11 points on the night.
On the Harvard side, junior point guard Brandyn Curry led the scoring in the second half, earning all 15 of his points in the latter part of the game including three layups in the final 1:30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.—Zack Rosen got the shots he wanted Friday evening—he just couldn’t get them to fall.
Now in his third year as a team captain, Penn’s first-team all-Ivy stalwart has turned in a remarkable senior season so far.
He currently sits in the top three in the league in scoring, assists, and minutes per game and was named one of 20 finalists for the prestigious Bob Cousy Award last month.
But in his final chance to knock off No. 21/25 Harvard in the storied Palestra, the unquestioned heart and soul of the Quakers came up just short, as Penn fell to Harvard, 56-50.
With 23.7 seconds to play in the game, Rosen drained a deep three-pointer to bring Penn within three and keep things interesting, but the rest of his baskets had come few and far between.
Leading his team with 16 points, Rosen shot 6 of 21 from the floor, marking the most field goals he has attempted in a game this season.
“Usually, I’m a `we’ guy. We win. We lose,” said Rosen, who relied on his quickness and an effective use of screens to get open looks at the basket. “[Friday] I felt like I was totally to blame. I didn’t hit the shots that I hit in my sleep, the shots I take day after day.”
In the most recent matchup between the Ancient Eight foes last March, then-sophomore guard Brandyn Curry held Rosen to 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting.
This year, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker again relied on the persistent Curry along with freshman guard Corbin Miller to keep up with the Ivy Player of the Year favorite, but their task was made a great deal easier by Rosen’s off night.
“He’s impossible to stop,” Amaker said of the Quaker star. “I think he missed some shots he’s normally going to make.”
A number of his shots looked on target but rimmed out—a phenomenon that afflicted his teammates early on as well, as the Quakers missed several makeable shots.
And so a four-point first-half showing did not dissuade Rosen from keeping the ball even more in the second.
He certainly did not receive much help from his teammates in the backcourt, as Tyler Bernardini struggled against the defense of Harvard sophomore Laurent Rivard, finishing with two points.
And Penn’s most efficient guard, sophomore Miles Cartwright, was forced to come out late in the second half with a leg injury after picking up 12 points.
MILLER TIME
Although he had his hands full chasing Rosen around all night, Miller caused Penn coach Jerome Allen his fair share of headaches too.
His 17 points on 5-of-10 field goal shooting tied him with Casey for a team high in points and represented his highest output of the season.
Bouncing back from a zero-for-seven (all three-pointers) showing against Cornell last weekend, Miller hit a three-pointer to end a 7-0 run by the Quakers early in the second half.
Minutes later, he scored seven points in a row on three straight jumpers to put the Crimson ahead, 46-37, with six-and-a-half minutes to go.
“He’s beyond his years,” Amaker said. “He’s got a very credible sense of balance about who he is. He doesn’t get rattled.”
After his playing time fluctuated during non-conference play, Miller has seen double-digit minutes in five of six games since missing three contests with a thumb injury but had not scored more than five points since pouring in 13 at Dartmouth on Jan. 21.
His offensive explosion was well-timed, as sophomore sharpshooter Laurent Rivard missed all five of the three-pointers he took Friday, and co-captain Oliver McNally was off his three shots from beyond the arc.
Besides Cartwright, in fact, Miller was the only reliable deep threat for either team. Despite having a number of open looks, the teams combined to shoot 9 of 41 (21.9 percent) from three.
SIZE MATTERS
Faced with a guard-oriented team, the Crimson looked to have an advantage in the frontcourt, with its combination of Wright, Casey, and freshman Steve Moundou-Missi matched up against the Quakers’ Henry Brooks, Fran Dougherty, and Mike Howlett.
While Casey picked up 15 points and Steve Moundou-Missi came off the bench to turn in nine points and eight rebounds, the host big men managed to stand their ground. Dougherty had a team-high seven rebounds and four points off the bench, and Penn equaled the Crimson in points in the paint, 16-16.
“They just work really hard,” Wright said. “They were being very physical.... Give credit to them.”
Wright struggled to finish at the rim and posted just one field goal for the first time in over a year, drawing some words of wisdom from Amaker.
“Coach talked to me and said, ‘We need you, and it’s not all about scoring.’ I know that, but it’s just a little frustrating to see that layup crawl out of the rim,” said Wright, who did pick up a game-high 13 rebounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering its first loss of the season to George Mason on Friday, the Harvard men’s volleyball team got back on track Saturday afternoon, defeating Princeton in a three-game sweep that was much more contentious than the final score might suggest. The Tigers (2-3, 1-1 EIVA) gave the home team a run for its money at the end of every game, but Harvard (6-1, 1-1) came away with the 3-0 win at the Malkin Athletic Center.
With its first loss of the year coming to the Patriots in a series of close games the night before, Harvard made sure that on Saturday night it would be the one scoring the crucial final points as evidenced in the 28-26, 25-23, and 25-20 results against Princeton.
“[Friday] night against George Mason, the games were tight at the end, and they made the plays and we didn’t,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “But [Saturday] we made those plays, and that’s good to see.… It shows confidence and poise and an ability to focus on our side.”
But it seems that the change of fortune was no accident. After getting tripped up by the Patriots’ play, the Crimson shifted its focus to the Tigers.
“Any time coming out of a loss like that, we are more determined and more focused than ever,” Baise said. “I don’t want to call it a reality check, but it was our first loss, and we realized we’re not always going to play as well as we had been. We had to figure out how to get wins even when we weren’t playing our best.”
One way Harvard made sure to avoid a repeat of Friday’s result was to adapt to its Ivy rival’s style of play.
“[Saturday] Princeton was tipping a lot, hitting the back corners, so we sort of adjusted where we were standing on the court,” sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. “And it was pretty effective in stopping their offense.”
The Crimson’s offense also stepped up, giving the Tigers more than they could handle in the form of Harvard’s two powerhouse freshman hitters, DJ White and Caleb Zimmick, who combined for 29 kills.
“Our freshman Caleb Zimmick was absolutely crushing it.… I don’t think he got blocked once,” sophomore hitter Nick Madden said. “And DJ White was obviously killing it too.”
Although the Crimson’s offense produced points when it counted, the first game saw the team struggling to pull away from Princeton. The teams traded points, neither leading by more than two, all the way until Harvard found itself facing a 24-23 deficit.
But co-captain Matt Jones stepped up under pressure with a vicious kill to keep his team in the game.
“Matt definitely stepped up—in game one he basically carried the team,” Madden said.
“Jones is the backbone of this team, as always,” Baise added. “He’s always at the center of what we’re doing.”
Subsequent kills from Zimmick and Madden reversed the tide and helped the Crimson take the first game, 28-26.
The second game began with the Tigers jumping ahead, and after several Harvard service errors, it looked like Princeton might run away with the game.
“I think we definitely struggled with serving, especially in game two,” Madden said. “I think we missed five or six serves, and that’s five or six points for them and five or six less for us.”
But a late push, once again led by kills from Zimmick, Jones, and sophomore Will Chambers, allowed the Crimson to charge ahead to a 25-23 win.
Harvard kept the momentum going into the third game and held off final comeback efforts by the Princeton offense. At times it looked like the Tigers still had a fight in them, but as the score approached 25, the Crimson pulled away and finished the win by a five-point margin.
“Princeton is a big rival for us in all kinds of ways…so we always try to bring our best game for them,” Blaise said. “When we left [Friday] we wanted to leave it behind us and focus on [Saturday], and the team did a really good job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team had a difficult weekend, losing two close matches to Brown and Boston University on Saturday before No. 12 Lehigh dominated the Crimson on Sunday afternoon.
On Saturday, both the Bears and the Terriers jumped out to early team leads.
Harvard kept it close and was within striking distance until the match’s final bouts. But Harvard was unable to win either contest.
“It came down to mistakes; who made more mistakes,” junior co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “The teams that made the least mistakes won the dual meets, and unfortunately that wasn’t us.”
The day saw two individual wins for both No. 12 junior Steven Keith and No. 8 Peppelman in the 133- and 157-pound weight classes, respectively, while four other Crimson wrestlers recorded a win on the day.
Peppelman carried his win streak to the next day against the Mountain Hawks, giving Harvard its only team points with a pin on Lehigh’s Brian Tanen.
The pin also gave Peppelman his 25th career fall, tying for third on the Crimson’s all-time list.
But Lehigh and its six ranked wrestlers, two of whom are No. 2 nationally, were too much for the Crimson, and the Mountain Hawks won nine of 10 matches with four major decisions and three pins against Harvard.
LEHIGH 40, HARVARD 6
The Crimson struggled against a dominant Mountain Hawks squad on Sunday at the Malkin Athletic Center. The only Harvard win came from Peppelman, who pinned his opponent, Tanen, at 4:56.
Already ahead in points, Peppelman had the advantage over Tanen on the floor. With Tanen still facing forward on all fours and Peppelman on his back, Peppelman grabbed hold of the inside of one of Tanen’s legs and wrapped his other arm under and around his opponent’s shoulder.
Soon after, Tanen got to his feet to make the escape, but the Harvard grappler shifted his grip to grab hold of Tanen’s waist and simultaneously pulled him backwards and back towards the ground.
In control, Peppelman managed to shift his hips around Tanen’s lower body, exposing his opponent’s back to the mat.
After a five-count gave Peppelman back points, he continued to attack Tanen. And with less than 10 seconds remaining in the period, Peppelman scooted his feet up closer to his head, folding his body over Tanen and forcing Tanen’s shoulderblades to inch closer towards the floor.
With one final kick in the air, Peppelman managed to get Tanen completely on his back to score the fall.
BOSTON UNIVERSITY 21, HARVARD 17
After traveling back to campus from an earlier away match against Brown, the Crimson suited up against Boston University in a cross-town rivalry match for the Charles Cup.
Wins from Keith, Peppelman, freshman Josh Popple and sophomore Cameron Croy put Harvard down only one point going into the final match between freshman David Ng and the Terriers’ Kevin Innis.
Innis scored the first takedown, but an escape by Ng brought the grappler within one, 2-1.
With the crowd’s excitement escalating, both wrestlers kept making tries at their opponent’s legs.
But in the end, Innis recorded two more takedowns, and BU came out with the win.
“Ultimately, there are several matches that could have gone either way,” Croy said. “[Saturday night] they happened to go BU’s way, but any other night, they could go our way, and we could win that. So, I don’t think it means that BU is a better team than us; it just means the cards fell that way.”
BROWN 22, HARVARD 17
In its first of three weekend matches, the Crimson traveled to Providence, R.I. to take on Brown.
After a major decision against freshman Max Mejia at the 125-pound class, Keith brought the team score back within one with a decision over the Bears’ Teodoro Popolizio.
Following Brown wins at 141 and 149 pounds, Peppelman recorded one of his three victories in as many matches this weekend, and the score moved to 10-8 in favor of the Bears.
Sophomore Ian Roy stepped onto the mat and gave Harvard its only lead after he defeated Jeffrey Lemmer, 7-3, at the 165-pound weight class.
Up 11-10 for the team score, the Crimson dropped its next three matches, securing the loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard women’s tennis team saw that Boston College, which had defeated the Crimson, 5-2, on Thursday, had lost to Syracuse, 4-3, the Crimson knew it needed to bring its A game to its dual match against the Orange on Sunday morning.
But at the Murr Center, Syracuse (5-3) proved to be too much for Harvard (1-3) and won, 4-3, by taking four of singles matches after dropping the initial doubles point to start the day.
All three doubles matchups went into tiebreakers, while five other sets in singles play also went into extra games.
“We know that Syracuse is one of the fittest teams in the region, so we were ready for that,” junior co-captain Kristin Norton said. “We knew it was going to be a big fight. We knew it was going to be tight. We were pretty positive going into the match, and everyone fought really hard. We just couldn’t pull it out.”
The Crimson started strong, winning two-out-of-three doubles matches to take the early lead.
Norton and her doubles partner, junior co-captain Hideko Tachibana, ranked No. 25 together, defeated their opponent, 9-7, at the No. 1 spot, while sophomore Hannah Morrill and freshman Kelly Whelan handled their foe, 8-6, on the adjacent court.
“We were expecting great volleys and for [Syracuse] to be really aggressive and come to the net all the time,” Norton said. “We’ve just been practicing doubles so much, and so far we’ve been kind of on a roll with doubles. So even though they were tough, we had the shots to back it up.”
The Crimson’s only pair who lost, senior Samantha Gridley and junior Camille Jania, brought its match to a tiebreaker at the No. 3 position before falling, 9-7.
With the doubles matches over, Harvard went into singles play ahead, 1-0.
On the No. 1 court, Syracuse’s Emily Harman soundly defeated Tachibana, 6-2, 6-1.
Sophomore Natalie Blosser dropped her contest, 6-2, 6-4, at the No. 4 spot, but Crimson victories at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots put Harvard up, 3-2, overall.
Jania kept her foe to a clean slate at the No. 3 court, earning a commanding 6-0, 6-0 win, while to her left, Norton also beat her opponent in two sets with a score of 6-2, 6-3.
“After losing to the girl from BC [last week], I was kind of upset, and I wanted to win even more [Sunday],” Norton said. “The girl I played [Sunday] was good. She was really aggressive, but I was able to stay consistent and control my aggression, as opposed to my past matches where I just went too much for myself.”
With the winner of the match still very much in the air, all eyes turned toward courts five and six.
Both Gridley, at the No. 5 position, and Morrill, playing at No. 6, endured gritty three-set matches.
After losing her first set, 6-2, Gridley battled through a 7-5 tiebreaker that evened the score between the players.
Gridley’s final set went into another tiebreaker, this one even closer than one before, but after a long deciding game, Gridley fell in her final set, 7-6.
Meanwhile, Morrill played tiebreaker games in all three of her sets.
Starting with a 7-5 victory, Morrill dropped the next two sets by an identical score of 7-6, and the Orange ended the morning with the 4-3 win.
According to Norton, one of Syracuse’s strengths was its ability to stay focused throughout the lengthy matches.
“[Syracuse is] very composed on the court,” Norton said. “They really show no emotion, so you never know when they’re losing. They just have great body language.”
The Crimson has a long time to recuperate following Sunday’s loss, as it is not back in action until Feb. 24 when it takes on Boston University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They entered the Ivy League Championships with dreams of capturing the league crown, but both the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams left New Haven this weekend with those dreams unrealized.
For the men, this year’s Ivy tournament presented an opportunity to defend last year’s Ancient Eight title, while for the women, it was an opportunity to end a three-year drought of Ivy glory.
“I think generally the men’s performance for the weekend was pretty strong,” freshman Peregrine Badger said. “We had a really difficult matchup against Princeton that cost us the title. It ended up coming down to the final points, so at the end, either one of us could have won the title.”
On the first day of the two-day tournament hosted by Yale, the No. 3 men’s squad opened with a 2-1 record, posting wins over Ivy foes Penn, 14-13, and Yale, 15-12, while coming up just one point short against Princeton, 14-13. Leading the Crimson men through the first leg of the tournament was co-captain Valentin Staller, who earned an 8-1 record in the saber.
On the second day, the men’s squad rounded out Ivy League competition with dominant performances against Columbia, 15-12, and Brown, 18-9.
With these two victories, the Harvard men closed out the tournament with a 5-1 record, good for second place in the team standings, just behind Princeton, which emerged from the tournament unbeaten at 6-0.
Despite falling just one point short of the Ancient Eight crown, four Crimson fencers—Staller, senior James Hawrot, freshman Brian Kaneshige, and sophomore Lucas Lin—were recognized for their individual efforts and earned All-Ivy honors.
Of the four, Staller, Hawrot, and Kaneshige were named to the All-Ivy First Team after finishing the weekend 12-3, 10-5, and 11-4, respectively.
Staller’s 12-3 record over the two-day tournament left him just one win shy of the individual title in the saber.
On the women’s side, despite falling short of the league crown, the team exceeded expectations this weekend, finishing third at the Ivy League Championships.
On the first day of the competition, the No. 7 Harvard women’s fencing team defeated Penn, 15-12, and dominated Yale, 21-6, before falling to Princeton, 18-9.
For the women’s squad, the victory over the Quakers had special significance.
“We had a really tough first match with Penn,” junior co-captain Felicia Sun said. “I don’t think that anyone was expecting such a strong opposition from them, but we sort of had a miraculous comeback against them to win that match. We had to win every single bout in the final round against Penn in order to pull out the win, and we did.”
On the second day, the Crimson women narrowly dropped its first matchup against Columbia but eventually claimed a 14-13 victory before posting two strong 18-9 results against Brown and Cornell to wrap up the competition.
By weekend’s end, the Tigers had successfully completed a three-peat of the women’s Ivy League title with an unbeaten 6-0 record, while Harvard finished in third with a record of 4-2 for the second straight year.
Leading the Crimson women at the Ivy League Championships were sophomore Alexandra Kiefer and junior Kathy Chou, who both finished the weekend with 13-5 records, good enough for two first-team All-Ivy nods in the foil.
Freshman Emma Vaggo, co-captain Caroline Vloka, and Sun were also recognized for their individual performances with second-team All-Ivy selections in the épée, saber, and épée, respectively.
With the Ivy League Championships behind them, the Crimson men and women will face off against local rivals at the Beanpot on Tuesday at the Malkin Athletic Center. NCAA Regionals and NCAA Championships are also on the slate for the Crimson in the coming weeks.
“What we are going to work on in the next couple of weeks is to really tune up our team’s dynamic,” Sun said. “The best thing we can do to improve as a team is to increase our level of communication with one another, improve our mental toughness and to become more team-performance-oriented and less individual-results focused.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final meet of the indoor regular season for the Harvard track and field team, one thing became very clear: Princeton is yet again a force to be reckoned with.
Though the Crimson had a number of strong individual performances by both the men’s and women’s squads, the Tigers took home the men’s and women’s team titles at Saturday’s HYP meet held at Gordon Indoor Track, outscoring the Harvard men, 100.5-56.5, and the women, 80-65.5. Both Crimson squads were able to top Yale, whose men and women scored 13 and 13.5 points, respectively.
“As with any track and field meet, some things go your way, and some go not so well,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Overall, I was really, really pleased with how well we did.”
“A few years back, Princeton had a sort of swagger about them,” Saretsky added. “They all really worked together and were confident as a team. I think that’s where we are now.”
The narrow gap between the Crimson women and the first-place Tigers, a perennial power in Ivy track and field, should also give the squad confidence as it prepares for the postseason.
“If things would have been a little different, I think that our women’s team could have actually overcome Princeton,” Saretsky said. “But that’s the way it goes.”
Harvard senior Meghan Looney earned an individual victory in the 800m run with a time of 2:11.07, continuing her dominance this season running the middle distances. Sophomore Alaina Murphy also competed in the 800 for Harvard, finishing in fourth place, just 0.65 seconds behind Looney.
“[Looney’s] just having fun,” Saretsky said. “She’s doing her thing, and it’s been exciting to see. It’s not something that shocks me or came out of left field. I think this is something that she’s been working toward for four years.”
The Crimson picked up 11 points—the highest possible amount—in the women’s weight throw. Sophomore Adabelle Ekechukwu, freshman Taylor DuPont, and juniors Shannon Watt and Chelsea Gilbert, a Crimson sports editor, swept the competition by finishing first through fourth, respectively.
Ekechukwu, a Crimson arts and photography editor, was back in competition on Saturday for the first time since December.
“This meet felt like the first meet of the season,” Ekechukwu said. “I was getting antsy and starting to feel that anticipation that athletes feel before competitions.”
She had no trouble shaking off the cobwebs, throwing a distance of 18.54 meters (60’10”) to set a new meet record. Ekechukwu’s mark bested the old meet record—set by Harvard’s Natalie Grant in 2002—by 7.5 inches.
But her day wasn’t over after winning the weight throw. Ekechukwu, who Saretsky said is more of a natural weight thrower, also competed in the shot put for the Crimson. Though she was topped by Watt and Dupont, Ekechukwu finished in fourth place, earning one point for Harvard.
“For her to get out there in the ring to add another point for the team, and to put up the meet record after having a couple weeks off, I think that bodes well for how she’s going to compete for us down the stretch,” Saretsky said.
Junior pole vaulter Nico Weiler added another standout performance for the Crimson on Saturday. The junior cleared 5.30 meters (17’4.5”) to set a school and meet record, earning the Crimson five points in the process.
On the men’s side, Harvard’s throwers had success as well. Freshman Ben Glauser and sophomore Dustin Brode finished first and second, respectively, in the shot put to earn eight points.
Glauser and Brode will be key if the Crimson men hope to narrow the gap with Princeton, Saretsky said.
“The pieces are there,” Saretsky said. “We have been working hard all year. Momentum builds from one meet to another, so I don’t think we need to do anything extraordinary. We just have to stay along the path that we’re on right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although it may have been a rough weekend at Princeton for Harvard men’s basketball, the women’s water polo team fared much better at the Princeton Invitational, finishing up 3-1 over the two-day tournament at DeNunzio Pool.
The Crimson (4-2) lost only to the Tigers (4-0), who were ranked twentieth in the country, while defeating Villanova (4-3), Colorado State (1-8) and Bucknell (2-2) by convincing margins.
Junior attacker Aisha Price led the offensive charge for the weekend with 13 goals, and freshman goalie Arieal Dukes headed the defensive effort with 29 saves across three games.
But with at least four different players scoring goals in each game, the tournament’s highs resulted from the entire team’s collaboration, which Harvard coach Ted Minnis names as the Crimson’s greatest strength at this early stage in the season.
“I think we’re so versatile,” Minnis said. “We’re not just one player or two players. Everyone is a threat at some point. If one person is unable to score, someone else will pick it up.... That’s the best thing about our team right now.“
HARVARD 12, COLORADO STATE 7
After a long weekend of games, Harvard was able to crank out a final win over the Rams by jumping to an early 4-0 lead in the first quarters.
Although Colorado State responded with a 3-1 run in the second frame, the game continued with both teams trading goals, but Harvard never surrendered its lead.
In the middle of the game, the Crimson struggled to maintain the early advantage. But the team never allowed the Rams to break into its two-goal buffer zone.
As the game continued, Harvard pulled away again, outscoring Colorado State 4-3 and 3-1 in the final two quarters to secure another victory.
The Rams were coming off a close loss against Princeton earlier Sunday morning, which may have had a strong effect on the team.
Colorado State only had its first win of the season on Saturday against Bucknell, but its early schedule was marked by several matchups with top-ranked teams, including Michigan and Indiana. While the Rams did not beat any of these teams, they scored several goals in the matchups, which helps Minnis view Harvard’s win over the team as a positive sign.
“We were very resilient in that game,” Minnis said. “They have been playing teams in the top twenty really tough—they only lost to Princeton 7-6 [in the final minute]. They’re a good team, and for us to come out and play that well and do the things we did, it just shows we’re on the right track.”
HARVARD 14, VILLANOVA 3
In the second meeting between the two squads in just over a week, the Crimson once again handily beat the Wildcats.
While the Harvard defense did not manage a first-half shutout this week against the squad, the Crimson still jumped to an 8-1 lead, allowing the team to cruise for the remainder of the game.
“Our energy was a little low in that game,” Minnis said. “We were probably looking ahead a little, after what happened last week.”
Most players earned minutes in the game, but Price led the team with four goals and five steals.
PRINCETON 9, HARVARD 6
In the sole loss of the weekend, Harvard battled it out with the Ivy rival Tigers, who were able to outscore the Crimson by one goal each quarter.
Considering the embarrassing 12-3 defeat Harvard suffered at the hands of Princeton when they played last February, the loss represented a strong improvement by the Crimson from last season.
“They had some good shooters, but I wish we had won,” Dukes said. “Once we start developing more as a team we’ll have the confidence they do. We’re getting there.”
While Harvard made a solid effort against the Tigers, weak passes and miscommunications on offensive ultimately cost the Crimson.
“We made mistakes, and good teams like Princeton know how to capitalize on that,” Minnis said.
HARVARD 14, BUCKNELL 5
The Crimson kicked off the weekend on Saturday morning with its first dominant win of the invitational against Bucknell.
Harvard’s defense showed early promise by not allowing any “natural” Bison goals. Bucknell was only able to score in man-up situations, one of the Crimson’s most noteworthy achievements of the weekend, according to Minnis.
“We can do things like [that] this year that we couldn’t do last year,” Minnis said. “We grew last year, and now we’ve added…new layers. We’re still growing as a team, and I want to add to that and keep going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing in its third carnival in as many weekends, the Harvard skiing team finished in ninth place overall at the Dartmouth Winter Carnival this weekend.
Highlighted by sophomore Rebecca Nadler’s second straight second-place result, the Crimson landed a pair of top-10 finishes.
“Over the last few years, [Nordick coach Chris City ’94] has been making a big effort to build the team into a competitive group of racers,” sophomore Nordic skier Chris Stock said. “He’s done that with a lot of focus, and I think we are starting to see some of the payback.”
After recording the Crimson’s first top-three finish in nearly 30 years the previous weekend at the Vermont Carnival, Nadler did it again this past weekend, finishing the giant slalom in 1:54.26, less than a second behind Vermont’s Kate Ryley.
“I just try to push it a little more each race,” Nadler said. “I just try to focus on good things. So far it’s going well.”
Senior Caroline McHugh and junior Catherine Sheils also gained NCAA points in the event, finishing 26th and 27th with times of 1:58.48 and 1:59.69, respectively.
The Crimson took 340 team points overall, 102 points back of its closest competitor, St. Lawrence University. The University of Vermont emerged victorious in the meet with 982 points.
Of the 15 competing teams, the women’s giant slalom squad took fifth place with 78 points. Harvard also placed in the top 10 in three of the four cross-country events, finishing sixth in the women’s 5k and eighth in both the men’s 10k and women’s 15k freestyle events.
“On Friday we saw some of the best overall skiing throughout the team that we have seen probably this season,” Stock said.
Junior Nordic skier Alena Tofte led all Crimson women in the event coming in ninth place with a 14:31.1 in the 5k on day one. Her 50:57.7 15k on day two was good for 18th.
Sophomore Christopher Stock was the engine and lone NCAA point scorer for the men’s team. He recorded a 10k time of 27:15.8, which was good for a 13th place finish.
“The NCAA is one of my season goals,” Stock said. “I still have a couple races left, and we will see how they turn out, but I’ve been able to keep up my fitness over the course of the season so far. I’m certainly looking forward to the rest of the season.”
Stock also finished 23rd in the 20k, running the course in 60:57.2. Harvard’s other finishers in both events were freshman Akeo Maifeld-Carucci, senior Torin O’Brien, and sophomore Tanner Wiegand.
While Dartmouth was forced to winter carnival events such as the human dogsled race due to a lack of snow, the conditions did not significantly affect all of the competitors.
“I thought the conditions were pretty good,” Nadler said. “The snow was quite firm.”
Andrew Spielvogel inched into the official results sheet, posting a time of 59.73 seconds in his first run for the alpine team. But he could not replicate his performance in the second run, finishing in 1:36.04, which placed him at 41st overall. Harvard finished 12th overall in the event.
On day two, Spielvogel and his teammates all failed to qualify for a second run and team points.
“The team is continuing to improve,” Nadler said. “I know some individuals continue to struggle, but I think everything is going in a positive direction, and it’s really fun to be a part of it. We are trying to put Harvard on the map right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Ivy League title resting on the final matchup of the day, the Harvard women’s squash team found itself in familiar territory with its oldest foe.
But unlike the 2011 CSA National Championship final, the No. 1 Crimson (14-0, 7-0 Ivy) overcame the challenge from No. 2 Yale (15-1, 6-1 Ivy) to take its 18th Ivy League title with a 5-4 win Sunday afternoon at the Brady Squash Center in New Haven.
In the squads’ first official meeting since the Bulldogs took the CSA Team Championships last February, Harvard fought back from a 4-2 deficit to tie the match at four games apiece.
Last February, Yale took the decisive ninth game. This time around, freshman Haley Mendez fought off Bulldog senior Alexandra van Arkel, sweeping the senior to complete the comeback.
“It came down to guts today,” co-captain Cece Cortes said. “Our girls dug in and showed a lot of heart, and we really won by the skin of our teeth, to be honest.”
Cortes’ co-captain Nirasha Guruge earned the Crimson its first win, as the senior won the last regular season match of her career against Yale co-captain Rhetta Nadas. After dropping the first game, 11-7, Guruge recovered with two convincing victories. And though Nadas made the fourth game close, Guruge closed out the win with a 13-11 victory.
Cortes followed suit with a 3-2 win over sophomore Gwen Tilghman. The pair traded games, but Harvard’s captain surged ahead in the fifth game, as her 11-5 victory handed the Crimson its second win. But the co-captains’ successes were sandwiched by two losses from Harvard freshmen, as Megan Murray and Julianne Chu dropped their first matches of the season.
The Bulldogs then took the lead in surprising fashion, as Yale sophomore Kim Hay handed junior Laura Gemmell her second collegiate loss.
Gemmell’s only previous loss was at the hands of Yale No. 1 Millie Tomlinson in last year’s individual national championship final. But playing in the No. 2 slot Sunday, Gemmell fell in a five-game loss that gave the Bulldogs the lead.
Yale junior Katie Bellaine forced Harvard against the wall, defeating junior Natasha Kingshott in four games.
When another loss meant the Ivy crown would reside in New Haven for the second straight year, the Crimson’s title chances rested in the hands of freshmen No. 1 Amanda Sobhy, No. 4 Mendez, and junior No. 7 Sarah Mumanachit.
Mumanachit knew from past experience the pressure of decisive matches.
“Last year, when we played Yale for the Ivy title, I was the last match on court at 4-4,” Mumanachit said. “It brought back memories, so it was tough.”
Sobhy cruised to victory against defending individual national champion Tomlinson, downing the sophomore in three sets and demonstrating why she was recently ranked as the seventh best under-23 player in the world.
“We think of [Sobhy] as our own Jeremy Lin,” Cortes said of the freshman sensation.
The result left Mumanachit and Mendez fighting for the title as the only players left on court.
Mumanachit dropped her first game to freshman Shihui Mao, 11-5, before taking the next two. Mao responded with an 11-6 win in the fourth, leading to a critical fifth game.
With Mendez firmly in control of her match against van Arkel, all eyes—and in some cases ears—were focused on Mumanachit and Mao.
“I was probably more nervous listening to the crowd during Sarah’s match than I was about my own match,” Mendez said.
Cortes echoed the sentiment, as she believes Mumanachit played the make-or-break match.
“[Mumanachit] showed tremendous mental strength and fortitude, but also adaptability,” the co-captain said. “She played long rallies but also attacked more, which is a new dynamic that she has added to her game that made the difference…. That was the match of the day.”
And Mumanachit showed that offensive strength as she powered to an 11-3 win to take the matchup.
With the score tied at 4-4, Mendez was halfway through her strong performance against van Arkel when the freshman dropped  her opponent, 3-0.
With its Ivy title, Harvard sits in pole position going into the CSA Team Championships, which will be held Feb. 24 at the Murr Center. But Cortes said she knows that now is not the time for her team to become complacent.
“We’re glad that we won today, but we have a lot of work to do over the next few weeks before Nationals,” the senior said. “We’re going to take this win and set it aside…and take nothing for granted. Some of the women we played today are going to be training hard, and they may come back and play better squash. So our level is going to have to come up if we want to maintain our seeded position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With all other courts empty and the overall match decided, the Murr Center crowd gathered in the stands for the last home match of the season Friday to watch sophomore No. 1 Ali Farag put on a show. Against an under-matched opponent, the 2010 Junior World Champion controlled the court with ease and finished off a clean sweep for the Harvard men’s squash team over No. 16 Brown, coasting to an 11-1, 11-1, 11-3 victory.
“We were a stronger team, and you could see it tonight,” Harvard coach Mike Way said.
The 9-0 rout, the first of Harvard’s two weekend matchups, marked the fourth consecutive win for the No. 4 Crimson (14-2, 5-1 Ivy).
“I thought it was a good match for everyone overall,” freshman Sachin Patel said. “We all played solid squash and it was a good tune up.”
The Crimson handled Brown (8-7, 0-6), dropping just a single game all match.
“Right now mentally, we’re in the best headspace we’ve been all year,” Way said.
Despite the disparity in rankings between the two squads, the Harvard players did not treat their matches lightly.
“A lot of guys went through their pre-match routine, just as they would on Sunday [against Yale], as they would for a bigger match, so they took this one just like the rest, and it came across in the score,” Patel said.
Against a lower-ranked opponent, when a lack of mental focus can cause what the players referred to as “silly” mistakes, the Crimson held strong until the final point of each match.
“One of my role models back in Egypt told me, ‘you can lose to anybody and you can win against anybody, so you need to give respect to everybody,’” Farag said.
“It’s a lot of staying focused and hitting good length,” Patel said. “It’s about taking opportunities when they come and staying mentally tough in the match.”
At the No. 9 position, co-captain Will Ahmed battled through two tough early sets in the final home match of his career. After winning the back-and-forth games, 11-9 and 11-8, respectively, Ahmed steamrolled through the third with a convincing 11-2 win.
Playing ahead of Ahmed was junior Alexander Ma, who faced off against Brown’s Neel Swami. Ma followed Ahmed’s lead, claiming a tightly contested 11-9 win in his opening game. But Ma stepped up in the subsequent two games, cruising to another straight-set win for the Harvard.
“Brown gave us some of the closest matches of the day at eight and nine,” Way said.
The middle of the Crimson lineup never faced a scare on the evening, adding six more 3-0 victories for the home team.
“We wanted to come in and take care of the job without too much trouble,” Patel said.
Junior co-captain Jason Michas made sure there wouldn’t be any trouble in his match, as he won by a comfortable margin at the No. 7 spot, 11-5, 11-6, 11-7. At the No. 3 spot, Gary Power had the day’s most dominant performance, dropping only four points in a dominant 11-1, 11-2, 11-1 victory.
At No. 2, the Bears provided the toughest competition of the evening, as Brown sophomore Blake Reinson took freshman Nick Hopcroft to four games.
“Their number two was very strong and gave our guy a good scare,” coach Way said.
After exchanging 11-8 games to open the match, Hopcroft found his rhythm and took the third game by a score of 11-6. With a 2-1 lead, Hopcroft carried momentum into the fourth and didn’t look back, as he finished off Reinson, 11-6, for a 3-1 victory.
Farag, at No. 1, came in as the heavy favorite over Brown’s Brad Thompson but had no trouble extending his undefeated season, as the rookie earned the straight-set victory.
“I played well today,” Farag said. “I tried to stay disciplined, and I didn’t go for any silly shots or anything like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With two wins against top-tier teams in the last two weeks—against then-No. 4 Rochester and No. 6 Cornell—the Harvard men’s squash team entered Yale’s Brady Squash Center hoping to stretch its recent unbeaten streak to five Sunday afternoon.
But the third-ranked Bulldogs had other ideas. After topping the Crimson in four of the day’s first six matches, Yale resisted a late Harvard comeback, earning the 5-4 win.
“We were disappointed with the result,” said Harvard assistant coach Reg Schonborn. “I think [Yale] played a little bit better…. We’re a young team, and I think our inexperience showed tonight. They played better in crucial areas of the match.”
“They were playing at home in their last match of the season. They have four seniors and it was sort of their last hurrah,” said co-captain Will Ahmed, who played at the No. 11 spot for the Crimson (14-3, 5-2 Ivy). “It looked overall like they wanted to make it the best match that they could.”
Yale (14-1, 6-1) got off to a strong start in the first cycle, taking two of three matches in the opening round.
Harvard co-captain Jason Michas won his match in three games at the No. 9 spot. But freshman Nick Hopcroft and sophomore Nigel Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, did not have as much success at the No. 3 and No. 6 positions, respectively.
Hopcroft dropped his match in three games, while Koh battled to a five-game loss despite holding a 2-1 lead.
“You can talk about the should-haves and the could-haves, but [Koh’s match] was a tough one to lose,” Schonborn said.
Down 2-1 heading into the second cycle, the Crimson picked up one more victory. Junior Zeke Scherl earned the second-round win for Harvard at the No. 8 position, taking down his Bulldog counterpart in four matches despite dropping the first.
Freshman Tyler Olson lost his match at the No. 5 spot in three, 11-9, 11-7, 11-4.
“Tyler had a bit of a tough match,” Schonborn said. “He couldn’t really find an answer [Sunday], but he’s a tough player who has done really well for the team so far. He’ll bounce back.”
Sophomore Brandon McLaughlin also struggled at the No. 2 spot, picking up a second-game victory but ultimately falling in four.
Harvard won its first match of the final cycle, with sophomore Ali Farag taking down Yale’s Kenneth Chan, 11-6, 11-6, 11-3. With the win, Farag finished off an undefeated regular season and closed the gap against Yale to 4-3 overall.
Next to finish was freshman Julian Kirby. The rookie looked poised to even the overall score at four after tying his match with Yale’s Samuel Clayman at two games apiece. But Clayman took the final two games, 11-9 and 11-6, securing the overall win for the Bulldogs.
Playing at the No. 4 spot, sophomore Gary Power—the last Crimson player on the court—earned a five-game victory for the Crimson. The effort came too late, as Yale had already secured a game-clinching 5-3 lead, but the sophomore helped Harvard narrow the gap and come away with a 5-4 finish.
“[Gary] did well to stay composed,” Schonborn said. “It’s tough to stay motivated through a tough battle after something like that happens.”
The Bulldogs were missing second-team All-American Hywel Robinson from their lineup on Sunday, giving the surging Harvard team a boost on which it could not capitalize.
“We thought we would have the edge with matchups, but they played a really tough match,” Ahmed said. “I think they wanted it a little bit more.”
Although obviously not pleased with the loss to its Ivy rival, the Crimson emphasized positive takeaways from the match at Yale, especially in terms of preparation for upcoming postseason competition.
“What we learned from today is that now we’re the underdogs,” Schonborn said. “We put ourselves there, but it’s a great place to be going into [CSA Team Championships] next weekend. We think we should be [ranked] a little bit higher than we are, and we have to prove it to ourselves and everybody else.”
“I think the big lesson is that it doesn’t matter what the matchups look like on paper,” Ahmed continued. “You have to go out and win them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Inherently, not many people can say that they have been the “Person of the Week.” Well, that is officially one more thing that Jeremy Lin ’10 can cross off of his to-do list.
On this week’s edition of ABC News’ segment of “Person of the Week”, Lin nabbed the honor, finishing off a week filled with much other recognition and praise from the basketball world and beyond. This award has previously gone to a variety of personnel, including ex-prisoner of war, Jessica Lynch, as well as a group that has reunited several Holocaust victims and their US veteran rescuers, among others.
ABC News states that Lin, on Friday, was the most searched person and name on the internet, and, after discussing his economic degree, quips, “the odds of a turnaround like this, any econ major can tell you, are slim to none.”
The program continued by emphasizing Lin’s background and, eventually, progressed to likening his numbers to those of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant—two of the most prolific scorers in NBA history. This comparison was quite a jump from the clip shown prior to that assertion, where Lin admits that he, only two weeks ago, was the twelfth to fifteenth man on the New York Knicks roster.
Perhaps the honor is accurately summed up by ABC News’ opening pun which declared that Lin’s fans have been “stunned by his sudden stardom, a fast break for this point guard who for a long time looked like he was going no where fast.” And that is truly what it has been—a fast break from start to finish, beginning at the end of the bench and ending here, as the Person of the Week.

Here from Flyby: The week, a review.
1. Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum surged ahead of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney Tuesday night after wins in Colo., Minn., and Missouri. A poll done by Public Policy Polling gives Santorum a 15-point lead over Romney and a 21-point lead over Newt Gingrich, whose candidacy has been plagued by financial struggles. But, later in the week, Mitt Romney reminded everyone that he is still a force to be reckoned with and a strong potential candidate for the GOP presidential nomination with a victory in the Maine caucuses and the unofficial endorsement from activists in the Republican party at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).
2. Greece is close to a vote on its austerity package, which would grant the country a bailout to avoid economic chaos. The package will cut "3.3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in wage, pension, and job cuts this year alone, to secure funds Greece needs to avoid bankruptcy next month," according to Reuters. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund are requiring that Greece commit to substantial financial reforms in order to receive the bailout.
3. The Fortune 500 was released this week, announcing Walmart as the top company for the second year in a row, followed closely by Exxon and Chevron. Fortune magazine reports that Wal-Mart Stores had a profit of over $16 billion in 2011.
4. We'll always love you, Whitney! Music icon, Whitney Houston, died Saturday at the age of 48. No news yet as to the cause of death, but speculations are in the air given the superstar's past struggles with drug addiction. Authorities are investigating the cause of death.
5. Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke issued a statement on Friday claiming that lingering problems with the housing market are holding back the American economy. Since their peak in 2008, home prices have fallen by 40 percent, leaving American home owners with less money. This has deterred spending and investment in the economy, causing the Fed's policies to be less effective, according to Bernanke.

UPDATED: February 13, 2012, at 1:19 a.m.
Over the past ten days, Harvard graduate and new NBA basketball sensation Jeremy Lin '10 has become a hotshot point guard for the New York Knicks, averaging 26.8 points in the team's last five games and dominating nationwide sports headlines.
For those out there who are interested in Lin, but haven't been consistently following the headlines, Flyby is here to lay out his path to success, from his trackrecord at Harvard to his splashing debut with the New York Knicks.
Lin was a standout on the Harvard basketball team, averaging 16.4 points per game his senior year and becoming the first Ivy League player to rack up at least 1,450 career points, 450 career rebounds, 400 career assists, and 200 career steals. He chose to play at Harvard when no Division I schools offered him an athletic scholarship coming out of high school.
Despite his standout Ivy League performance, Lin went undrafted at the 2010 NBA draft but was picked up by the Dallas Mavericks to play for the summer league squad. After turning heads with his impressive summer showing, Lin signed a contract with the Golden State Warriors, the team closest to his hometown of Palo Alto, Calif. Following a year in which he averaged 2.6 points per game, he was cut in December, 2011. His NBA career was extended when he signed a new contract with the Houston Rockets, but before the season began he was let go.  On Dec. 27, 2011 he was picked up by the New York Knicks.
Lin's breakout performance occurred on Feb. 4 when he scored 25 points off the bench against the New Jersey Nets. He started the subsequent four games, helping to lead the Knicks to victory over the Utah Jazz, the Washington Wizards, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Minnesota Timberwolves.
Nobody in NBA history has scored as many points in his first four starts. In addition to being the first Harvard player in the NBA since 1954 and the first Ivy-Leaguer in the NBA since 2003, Lin is the first American-born player of Chinese or Taiwanese descent to play in the NBA and only the fourth Asian American in NBA league history.

In this series, Flyby asks Harvard students to weigh in on topics worth polling.
In a recent, informal, highly flawed poll, Flyby asked 16 members of the Harvard community if it was more impressive for New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to have landed supermodel Gisele Bündchen, or vice versa. Thirteen (81 percent) answered that Bündchen was the more impressive catch.
Brady, as the Pat's quarterback, has led his team to five Super Bowls and has won three of them. He has the best regular season win percentage of all time. When it comes to throwing a football, Brady is probably one of the best people at it.
Bündchen was introduced in the July 1999 Vogue magazine cover as "The Return of the Sexy Model." As the highest paid model in history, Bündchen could well be the best of those who are professionally beautiful.
It should be noted that no one included in this poll was ignorent of who either Brady or Bündchen was.
And now, for an analysis: Ultimately, Brady plays a sport that has the word 'American' in the title, and Bündchen is a fashion model who has transcended cultural barriers to reach a prime position in the supermodel elite. It is little wonder that these 16 students (and the Harvard population at large?) think of her as the worthier of the two in this celebrity relationship.
Three points to Gisele.
