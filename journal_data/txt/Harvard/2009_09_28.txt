Paying your dues pays off. The Obama administration apparently realizes the wisdom of this logic and appreciates smart foreign policy, as evidenced by their recent choice to reengage with the U.N. by paying U.N. member dues, unlike the previous administration, which neglected its fiduciary responsibilities to the body. This reconciliatory approach, coupled with the removal of aggressively situated missile defense shields in Eastern Europe, has paid out enormous political dividends in the form of cooperation from other nations on the problem of nuclear weapons in Iran. Specifically, Russian President Dmitri A. Medvedev has expressed a new level of receptiveness to the idea of helping the U.S. curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions, stating, “We believe we need to help Iran to take a right decision... sanctions rarely lead to productive results, but in some cases, sanctions are inevitable.”
The addition of Russian support in the effort to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons is a major victory for the U.S. The Obama administration should capitalize on this moment by drafting up a plan for multilateral intervention that secures a written agreement from Russia and leverages the United State’s position in the battle against nuclear proliferation. The Russian expression of a desire to cooperate comes at a particularly convenient time, considering the recent discovery of a secret Iranian uranium enrichment facility. Clearly, Iran has not been entirely transparent about its nuclear development, and the Obama administration needs to make sure that the U.S. will not be blindsided by the nuclear ambitions of Tehran.
But this does not mean that the United States’ newly buttressed position should be used to antagonize Iran. The volatile nation is not one that responds well to threats or accusations—shortly after the Obama administration’s censure of the Iranian deception, Iran test-fired several short-range missiles in what may be interpreted as a show of force. There is still potential for reconciliation, and the upcoming talks with Iran in Geneva should be defined by neither appeasement nor Axis-of-Evil-era aggression, but rather by a U.S. that is willing to negotiate but is unwilling to tolerate further deception. These talks represent the first direct negotiations with Iran in 30 years and a chance to repair a relationship that has continued to decline into a state of disrepair for the last eight years.
The Iran issue is dauntingly complex and terrifyingly volatile, but not impossible to solve. It is not in Iran’s best interests to start an international conflict when the only one on their side is an Iranian public who questions its own government’s legitimacy. Rather than immediately coercing Tehran, Obama should make sure that he continues to adopt a flexible and multilateral foreign policy through negotiation, not alienation.

When implementing recent budget cut decisions, the administration has appeared somewhat closed to outside influence. Thankfully, there may be a remedy to this glaring problem. FAS has now launched an online Idea Bank inviting students, faculty members, and the community to submit their budget cut ideas and rate those of others.  Administrators have already successfully halved the FAS deficit, bringing it down to a more manageable $110 million from the original figure of $220 million. Now they are asking the broader Harvard community to have a role in coming up with possible additional cuts.
We are glad to see the administration request student and faculty input in this process. The shuttle conundrum could have been avoided if the administration had taken that initiative earlier. Regardless of the tardiness of this step, we believe this is a good initiative and we encourage people to make use of the website.
We hope that working groups will take the ideas seriously in their deliberations, as many ideas already on the website appear sensible and creative. We also hope to see such ideas being incorporated into the next round of budget cuts. Nevertheless, it is up to students and the community to take this opportunity to voice their opinion and be a part of the budget cut process. Many were quick to criticize the University on the lack of transparency in their decision-making process when it announced its first round of cuts. The Idea Bank is a great opportunity to remedy this. The site makes it very easy for users to contribute, as it is well-designed and simple to use. Ideas can be posted anonymously, and viewers can then rate each idea on a 1-to-5 star scale. Users can even comment on posted ideas and offer their feedback.
The administration has made important progress in incorporating student opinion into this difficult process.  Now it remains up to students and the community to make sure this bank can keep FAS from going bankrupt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Thursday, the third episode of Professor Michael Sandel’s course “Moral Reasoning 22: Justice” will air on Boston’s WGBH. Though Harvard is still a latecomer to the realm of public access education—schools like MIT and Yale have offered podcast courses through Apple’s iTunes U for years—in general, media reactions to Sandel’s television series have been positive. Most laud it for supporting freedom of information and combating the exclusivity of the Ivy League education; some even go so far as to hail such open access as the end of Old Academia.
While the Internet has already made it difficult for subscription services like newspapers to compete, writers argue a similar transformation will occur with the university. Now that Harvard and other top universities are putting their content online, the argument goes, the physical university will become a relic. A high-quality classroom experience is open to anyone with a computer.
The point is fair, but it raises unsettling questions for those of us paying 50 grand a year to be here. Are there any benefits to being at college beyond Sunday morning hangover brunches? In most large lecture classes, one rarely, if ever, gets face-time with a professor. What privileges do Harvard undergraduates have over listeners tuning in to podcasted lectures from 3,000 miles away?
The answer is simple, but often overlooked. What programs like WGBH cannot provide is a factor that Harvard students may well take for granted: that of other Harvard students. One big reason why “Justice” draws upward of 1000 students every semester is its interactive experience—Sandel poses ethical quandaries to his lecture audience, they respond to him and to each other, and this back-and-forth lends a crackling excitement to the proceedings. Viewers at home sitting in front of screen can’t engage in this themselves: They can only watch as some undergrad in the third row defends his decision to push or not push a man off a bridge. Only students actually in class can go beyond merely passive experience to get actively involved in learning.
The value of peers in learning is nothing new. Though the advent of printing permitted communication among networks of philosophes and thinkers during the Enlightenment, it was nonetheless through debate in academies and salons that intellectual discourse advanced. Similarly, though we can get much out of reading on our own or watching lecture videos online during reading period, it is in conversation with peers that our views solidify and gain clarity.
Keeping this in mind makes every second spent on Facebook, Gmail, or nytimes.com in section even more regrettable. It’s not just our own learning experience we’re hurting by not paying attention; when we skip readings, give rehearsed answers for participation points, or tune out our TFs entirely, we’re cutting down on other people’s opportunities for discussion as well.
Nor are professors entirely blameless. With more courses videotaped and slides posted online, lectures tend to see declining attendance as the semester progresses. Lecturers bear a responsibility to their students to create an experience for students beyond just what can be videotaped and recycled year-to-year. That means getting the audience involved in some way—whether it be through interactive demonstrations, projects, or in-class discussions like Sandel’s.
None of this is to say that we should stop videotaping. More courses will and should follow “Justice” in being adapted to television or podcast; disseminating knowledge into the public sphere is part of Harvard’s academic responsibility to share information. But such measures should be taken with the understanding that Internet videos or podcasts will never result in the same level of critical thinking as face-to-face discussion and debate. The value of the Harvard experience transcends lectures that can be videotaped and study guides that can be posted online; it is rooted in the dialogues that transpire in sections and study groups. In the end, these are the factors that must take precedence if we are to justify actually being here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Ravi Raj accepted a position at the Harvard-MIT Data Center, he was thrilled to have the opportunity to work for a university that he believed would be a progressive and prestigious employer. Yet, to his surprise, Raj received warnings early on from his managers to never take part in union activity at his new job—although he was a member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. He was even more disturbed when a new supervisor began to subject him to racial slurs, mocking his Indian accent in front of other staff. The incidents that followed are not just an embarrassing, and as yet unresolved, incident for the Harvard community; they demonstrate a troubling lack of accountability in protecting union rights on campus.
Raj immigrated to the United States from India in 1986. Receiving a master’s degree in Management Information Systems, he worked at Hewlett-Packard, Anderson Consulting and Tufts University before accepting his job here at Harvard. When Raj stood up for his rights and complained to administrators about his poor treatment, he faced the consequences of a flawed system: Raj’s boss took away his office, criticized his work, and gave him a mediocre evaluation while Raj waited for assistance that never came.
Though Harvard provides official avenues for employees to voice complaints of discrimination, Raj has hit several roadblocks and in the meantime has faced threats and intimidation. Last April, on the day of Raj’s scheduled meeting between his union representative, his supervisor at HMDC, and Human Resources, a stranger approached Raj inside a building where he was working and threatened him by name. According to Raj, the man said, “Ravi Raj, you have chosen the wrong path and the wrong union. You should watch out.” Such an action is despicable for its cowardly and bullying nature.
Harvard University cannot tolerate discrimination and the intimidation of its workers. As appalling as the racial slurs against Raj may be, more disturbing is his experience when he decided to speak up. While Raj has filed complaints with the Harvard University Police Department and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, Raj currently must work under the same supervisor and has received threats of being fired—even though clients often write compliments about his efficient work. The mechanisms in place at Harvard to deal with discrimination and intimidation in the workplace have failed Ravi Raj.
Raj has pursued conflict resolution with management at HMDC, HR, and even the office of the University Ombudsman without success. When contacted, HR and the office of the Ombudsman declined to comment, citing employee confidentiality. While this may be simply their policy, someone needs to step in and speak up on Raj’s behalf. One of the mechanisms in place must be broken—if not the whole system—as it appears Raj’s case has been lost without resolution. Even if there is a reason that Raj’s superiors, HR and the office of the Ombudsman have not pursued his complaints, their official silence has not allowed for resolution of Raj’s unfortunate situation. Regardless of whether the people able to bring about a positive change for Raj believe his story, they still should recognize that an employee feels seriously threatened in his workplace. It is inexcusable that no one has moved to resolve this situation for Raj on humane grounds alone.
In this challenging economic time it is even more important that we remain vigilant about cases of discrimination and intimidation in the workplace. With jobs more scarce, such cases are more likely to go unreported as people are afraid of being laid off. For his part, Raj works in fear that he will be fired because of the animosity that exists between him and his supervisor, and he believes that his co-workers are too afraid to stick up for him because of fears for their own jobs. Do we have a good enough system in place to ensure that Harvard employees are safe to defend their rights, whether on their own or as a member of any union? It would be difficult to look Raj in the eye and say, “Yes.”
Ideally the avenues in place to deal with complaints of discrimination would have worked, and Raj would have been placed elsewhere immediately, the supervisor punished, and the situation resolved. For Raj, still working in an environment that feels unsafe, a fair solution would be for management to place him in a different office with a new supervisor. Union members, students and concerned community members have held several demonstrations on Raj’s behalf. These should continue. More broadly, though, the University must look closely at the mechanisms that are currently failing to protect workers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, some students at a handful of colleges that had outsourced their e-mail accounts to an outside provider unintentionally gained access to each other’s inboxes. For anyone who sends sensitive information via e-mail—that is, all of us—it’s the worst kind of nightmare, one that causes people to bolt upright in a cold sweat. This provider, which we’ll call Company X, declined to state which schools the mistake affected, although Brown admitted it was one of them. Worst of all, the glitch went unnoticed by authorities for more than three days until Company X “fixed” the problem by shutting down the accounts.  Brown’s IT department was never informed, and the other schools’ probably weren’t, either.
While Brown admits the episode only affected 22 students, it serves as an excellent anecdote for arguing against University-wide outsourcing of vital IT services like e-mail or tech support. At the very least, it shows that schools should be very careful about which companies they entrust with sensitive information. But Company X isn’t some small start-up run by inexperienced managers. Surprisingly enough, it’s Google, one of the most trusted brands in any industry.
The story holds more weight considering that it could have happened here. Harvard contemplated hosting webmail with Google in 2006, but ruled out the service last year with the switch to the new college.harvard.edu addresses. While FAS e-mail is far from immune to outages or access glitches, we should now feel especially grateful Harvard has kept its e-mail within the family.
The point isn’t that Google is a failure, which obviously isn’t true, but rather that the search leader isn’t the heavenly gift some of us make it out to be. Every technology company will have difficulty meeting the high standards our society imposes, and compared to other web services, Google has had relatively few hang-ups over the last decade. But since Google so often gets things right, its mistakes serve as a reminder that things can go wrong.
It’s important that Google’s failings get publicized, because the attitude that Google is magical or even infallible pervades Harvard and probably most other universities. Students here use Google services for scheduling, instant messaging, and even writing notes or saving essays. Few even acknowledge the existence of other search engines. Harvard doesn’t even need to outsource to Gmail, because at least 60 percent of the student body has done that already.
In fact, so many people rely on Google for nearly every computerized activity that the rest of us can’t escape it. I’ve been laughed at numerous times for not forwarding my Harvard e-mail to a Gmail account. I’ve had club mailing lists switched to a Google Group because other members thought the HCS list admin interface was too confusing. I’ve even been asked to use Google Docs to collaborate on problem sets.
It’s not that I think Google performs these services poorly. But it’s risky to route all of the data in our lives through one system. We shouldn’t depend on a group of engineers on the other side of the country to make sure that our homework gets done.
An even bigger concern rests on the fact that Google has struggled with issues of privacy and transparency for years. Just take the case with Brown: Google shut down these broken email accounts without contacting the schools, and Brown’s administrators were none too pleased. It’s also commonly known that e-mails sent to or from a Gmail account probably stay on the company’s servers forever. And while it’s unlikely that Google employees are pawing through Gmail accounts, a machine scans every e-mail and extracts the general gist in order to send targeted advertising. All that data extracted from e-mails can be logged, and Google’s lack of disclosure about what it will do with your information  is particularly suspicious. (Co-founder Larry Page has refused to explicitly state that Google will not build up dossiers based on users’ search patterns and e-mails.)
Google’s invasions of privacy have been well publicized, yet few people worry because they don’t question the basic assumption that Google serves the public good. Advocates point to its record of giving away services for free, from YouTube to Google Maps to Picasa, and its informal motto, which used to be “Don’t Be Evil.” But while Google has worked hard to gain the trust of its users and understands that it needs to keep that trust in order to stay on top, it has been publicly traded for the last five years. Google’s ever-changing stockholders could soon decide to put the bottom line above consumer loyalty, and all the info Google has mined from your searches and emails is worth billions to advertisers.
Ultimately, Google is no worse than other companies of similar size and influence throughout history and behaves far better than some, like Microsoft in the late 1990s. Yet, since Google has become the standard provider for so many services, we need to remind ourselves that other, often better choices do exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brendan Maher spent his career as a psychology professor, department chair, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences dean, but in passing away this St. Patrick’s Day, he reminded friends and family that he was also an Irishman with a sense of humor.
In a memorial service held Friday afternoon, friends, family, and colleagues spoke of Maher’s witty and personable nature as well as his time in the British Royal Navy and the summers he spent in Nova Scotia with his family.
He passed away at the age of 84 at his home in Durham, North Carolina from prostate cancer.
Maher began his career at Harvard in 1960 as a lecturer in the psychology department and left in 1964 to teach at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Before returning to Harvard in 1972, Maher served as dean of the faculty at Brandeis University. During his tenure at Harvard, he taught undergraduates, extension school students, and graduate students. He also served as chair of the psychology department twice and as dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
“He had an excellent sense of humor and, of course, a great mind,” said Social Ethics Professor Emeritus Herbert C. Kelman, a long time colleague of Maher’s, in an interview. “He had good relations with most everybody and he was widely respected. He was a leadership type.”
Psychiatry professor and colleague Theo C. Manschreck described Maher as a “pioneer in the field” of psychopathology research and said his book “The Principles of Psychopathology: An Experimental Approach” changed the field of schizophrenia research. Published during a time when most research was focused on description and rating of individual patients, Maher encouraged the use of more systematic experimental psychology methods to study schizophrenia.
“He wanted all to know the necessity of sound methodology,” Manschreck said.
Former students said they also found Maher to be an accessible, patient and humorous mentor.
Courtenay M. Harding came to Maher as a graduate student at the University of Vermont looking for help with a study. Although Harding was not a Harvard student, Maher met with her every Friday for 18 months to discuss the methodology and design of her study.
“He taught me so much, but he wouldn’t take any consulting money,” she said.
“I asked him one day why he spent so much time and energy on this project. He rubbed his hands together with glee and said, ‘I love to do work that is of practical significance.’”
Winifrid Barbara Maher, Maher’s wife of 56 years, taught with her husband several times at the Extension School.
“He thoroughly enjoyed teaching,” she said in an interview. “He loved working with students and mentoring them. He was always there to help students doing research.”
In concluding the memorial service, Reverend Peter J. Gomes noted Maher’s “grace and style” as a GSAS dean and called him an “island of calm in a sea of chaos.”
Maher is survived by his wife, five children, and five grandchildren.

Pub workers traded aprons for lederhosen Friday night as the Cambridge Queen’s Head celebrated the German holiday of Oktoberfest.
With posters of stein glasses on the walls and a German brass band playing polka, the Queen’s Head served regional fare—three different kinds of bratwurst, sauerkraut and potato salad.
“It was great. It was fantastic,” said Joshua P. Woodruff ’11, the Queen’s Head’s student manager of marketing. “The pub was full all night. We had a great time serving out the German cuisine.”
In addition to German food, the pub had four Oktoberfest-themed beers on tap—including Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen and Spaten Oktoberfest from Germany—and four bottled beers especially selected for the occasion, ranging from New England’s Sam Adams OctoberFest to the German Weihenstephan.
Some patrons got into the German spirit with gusto.
James B. Danner ’12 came early in the evening wearing suede lederhosen, a traditional mountain jacket, and a pair of mountaineering boots called bergschuhe.
“It’s just nice to pretend we’re in a very different state of mind,” he said, reminiscing on his summer in Germany. “Munich’s a very different city.”
Danner came with Lillian L. Erlinger ’10, who lived in Germany for six years and frequented Oktoberfest in Munich.
“We just wanted to wear the outfits,” Erlinger said, and she was appropriately bedecked in a blue dirndl—a folk dress consisting of a petticoat, blouse, skirt and apron.
Not all of the customers present were prepared for the Oktoberfest-ivities at the pub, and some were surprised by the elaborate celebration.
New York University graduate student Rich S. Carapezza and Cristina Ortiz ’10 stuck to nachos and French bread pizza over Pilsner and knackwurst.
“We just came here to get food because we missed the dining hall hours,” said Carapezza.
“I was really happy when I saw what was going on,” Ortiz said. “It seems like a lot of fun.”

A panel of scholars of American history and literature sat in front of a stone fireplace and under the painted gaze of their deceased predecessors to debate how best to represent the American literary tradition in a single volume at an event on Friday in the Barker Center’s Thompson Room.
The group of eight entertained a packed room with a heated debate, inspired by the publication of A New Literary History of America, a collection of over 200 provocative entries spanning the entire history of America.
Edited by rock ’n roll critic turned scholar Greil Marcus and Professor of African American Studies and English Werner Sollors, the book does not seek to create a new American literary canon, but instead it includes entries that cover a more diverse group of literary figures including John Winthrop, Diego Rivera, Chuck Berry, and Barack Obama.
The tome runs to well over a thousand pages and includes entries from more than 200 contributors. Marcus and Sollors completed the work of compiling and editing the volume after four years, and it was published last week by the Harvard University Press.
In selecting the contributors, Marcus said that he and Sollors posed the questions: “Who do we want to hear from? Who will tell us something we don’t know?”
The result is a volume that assembles the work of visual artists, novelists, as well as traditional scholars. But Sollors emphasized the book is “not an encyclopedia but a provocation.”
Some entries explore the connections between two subjects, while others are works of art. The volume ends with a set of nine prints by artist Kara Walker, who is known for creating black cut-paper silhouettes, depicting the election of Barack Obama.
But many of the scholars on the panel raised questions about whether or not the book presents a clear narrative of American history.
Entries in the volume are placed in chronological order, but they are not grouped into themes or historical periods.
“I agree that the brio-creating strategy is very energizing,” said English Professor Lawrence Buell. “But I can see that there could be a problem if we had to depend on it to the last as a form of historiography.”
While he was reading it, Buell said, the book felt as if it “started the universe anew in every chapter.”
But Marcus contended that if the book does not have a historical skeleton, it doesn’t need one. “What it is in pursuit of is a heart,” he said. “That might tell us a lot about where the country is and where it needs to go.”

Facing a $110 million dollar budget deficit over the next two years, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has unrolled a new online “Idea Bank” Web site that allows students, faculty, and staff to share anonymous proposals about ways to reduce expenses.
Announced on September 15th at an open forum meeting conducted by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, the Idea Bank, now in its second week of existence, also includes a feature by which site visitors can comment and rank the proposals that have been posted. A “Top rated ideas” tab on the site brings users directly to a list of proposals that have received the highest user rankings on a five star scale.
Currently topping the list? An idea marked “Energy Savings by turning lights off” clocks in at an average ranking of 4.91, boasting 115 votes, three comments, and a reminder that buildings like the Malkin Athletic Center are currently lit all night, and could benefit from the installation of a timer or motion sensor system.
Other ideas on the site urge administrators to shore up FAS’ economic position by charging fees to large tour groups looking to enter Harvard Yard, eliminating paper examinations, ditching dining hall trays, and cutting the Dorm Crew program that currently pays student employees to clean other students’ bathrooms.
“People can clean their own bathrooms,” the last submission reads.
An introduction on the Idea Bank’s home page signed by Smith and College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds asks visitors to “please frame your suggestions and questions in ways that reflect Harvard’s community standards of integrity and mutual respect.”
“Posts that contain profanity, personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be edited or blocked,” the statement reads.
Still some of the posts strike a cheeky tone.
One submission, marked “Invest endowment better” suggests that the University “find someone who actually knows how to invest to run the endowment.”
None of the ideas on the Idea Bank site have yet been implemented, because it has only been a short period since the site was launched, wrote FAS spokesman Jeff Neal in an e-mail to The Crimson yesterday. Neal added that the highly rated recommendations deposited on the Idea Bank will be reviewed by the working groups currently tasked with considering ways to cut costs in the various FAS divisions.
“The Idea Bank is one more way we are trying to engage the entire FAS and Harvard College community as we all consider how to best advance our core mission of teaching and research in a more efficient and cost-effective manner,” the Web site reads.
The Harvard Idea Bank is not the first of its kind. MIT launched a tool with a design uncannily similar to Harvard’s several months ago as part of its attempt to cut operating expenses, recognizing that “the work to sculpt a stronger MIT will require collective wisdom and collaborative action.”

The National Institute of Health announced on Thursday that eighteen Harvard-affiliated scientists would receive five years of grant support for research that has the potential to greatly expand the scientific field and explore new frontiers.
NIH distributed $348 million in three categories: the New Innovator Award, the Pioneer Award, and a new program, the Director’s Transformative Award. Last year, the institute awarded $138 million in New Innovator and Pioneer awards. This year, an additional $210 million dollars was made available in grants, including $23 million that was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—or the stimulus bill.
The 2009 funding levels are the largest in the program’s 5-year history.
In March 2008, University President Drew G. Faust traveled to Washington to lobby congress for an increase in funding for bio-medical research. She emphasized the need for a real-dollar increase in the total amount of NIH funding, which is the single largest funding source for Harvard projects. This year, Harvard researchers have secured 16 percent of the 2009 NIH grants.
Genetics Professor Frederick M. Ausubel, who will use a Transformative research grant to work on solutions to antibiotic resistance, said that one of the difficulties of conducting high-risk research is that people are reluctant to fund a project if there is no guarantee that the results will be relevant.
According to Ausubel, the NIH grants allow researchers to develop hypotheses that are “compelling yet may not be correct.”
“Sometimes you need to take the risks. There is no 100% guarantee of success, but if there is, it pays off greatly,” he said.
Pardis C. Sabeti, an assistant professor of organismic and evolutionary biology who received a New Innovator Award, said she will use the funds to further her research into the Lassa fever which she describes as “the most deadly disease known to man.”
So far, in her research station in Irrua, a small town in rural Nigeria, the fatality rate of the disease has been reduced from 70 percent to 15 percent by using effective drugs and advanced diagnosis techniques.
With the grant she will be able to take her research further and investigate the possible presence of inherent genetic immunity to the disease, an advance that could reveal additional insights into the human genome.

The 14 JFK St. space that previously housed Z Square has remained conspicuously empty for more than eight months since the restaurant was shut down in January due to license violations. But last Tuesday, Peter Lee and Patrick Lee, owners of the popular restaurant and bar Grafton Street, applied to transform the space into the Brattle House Tavern.
According to the Cambridge License Commission, Peter Lee—who also co-owns Redline and Temple Bar in Cambridge—also applied for an entertainment license that will allow the restaurant to provide live music, Karaoke, and a DJ.
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, the new restaurant and bar may open its doors as early as this December. She hesitated to provide a date, saying that Patrick and Peter Lee have not yet finalized a concept for the restaurant.
“Z Square is a beautiful space, but they will be making some renovations to it and I expect it’ll all happen very quickly,” Jillson said. “If it isn’t ready by the holidays, we hope it will be ready at least for our Winter Carnival.”
Jillson said she was “very pleased” that the 14 JFK St. space has finally been rented out after more than half a year of vacancy.
Shabu Square, a hotpot restaurant on the corner of Eliot and Winthrop Streets that closed its doors after less than a year in operation, will be replaced by Conga, a Latin American tapas restaurant in the coming months. Panja S. Lymswam, the owner of Shabu and two other Thai restaurants in the Square—Spice and 9 Tastes—appeared before the License Commission in August to request the change.
Lymswam and Peter and Patrick Lee are among many restaurateurs who hold multiple businesses in the Square. Matt Curtis and Chris Lutes opened Tory Row this year in addition to their Square restaurant Cambridge 1; Marley J. Brush, the daughter of Thomas J. Brush who co-owns Felipe’s, opened Crèma Café last year. Monella, a clothing boutique that replaced the regional chain JasmineSola a year ago, is operated by the same family that owns Mudo on JFK St.
“There is a sort of formula—I don’t want to call it magic—but it’s that good business sense of what works in Harvard Square,” Jillson said.
The Crate & Barrel building on Brattle St., which has also been empty since January, has had less luck in finding tenants. “The building is an award-winning design, and it’s unlikely the owners are just going to put anyone in there just to rent out the space,” Jillson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The culmination of the “Say Yes to Drugs” campaign, which has been advertising its message in front of the Science Center for much of this week, came on Saturday with a benefit dance and speech in support of better global access to generic drugs.
The campaign, co-sponsored by the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition (HCGHAC) and other student groups, generated roughly $6000 for charity and close to a thousand signatures on an online petition.
The petition pushes for the University to remove “legal barriers to generic production of Harvard technologies in resource-limited countries,” making it easier for those in developing countries to access medicine based on discoveries made at Harvard.
Saturday’s events began with a speech from Dr. Matthew Craven, co-founder of Support for International Change, who focused on the importance of removing hurdles to wider production and distribution of generic drugs. Craven keyed on issues with “innovation, access[ibility] and delivery” of medicine to developing countries and argued that encouraging pharmaceutical companies to allow for the production of generic drugs was a step in the right direction in overcoming these challenges.
Later in the evening, the dance—which took place in the basement of the Northwest Science Building—brought in money for Partners In Health and the Asha organization via donations, ticket sales and t-shirt sales.
Last year, HCGHAC campaigned in support of University investment in a global health center and in research for neglected diseases, but the global economic downturn prompted the group to reevaluate their priorities.
According to HCGHAC member Krishna M. Prabhu ’11, the group decided to push for something that would not be a financial burden on the university but would still increase access to essential medicine. The South Asian Men’s Collective, the South Asian Women’s Collective, the Black Men’s Forum and the Association of Black Harvard Women co-sponsored the campaign and assisted in publicizing Saturday’s events.
According to group member Jillian L. Irwin ’11, HCGHAC’s next move is to work closely with the administration in order to ensure “concrete knowledge that global access will be implemented in the negotiating process.”

Colombian President Alvaro Uribe spoke to a packed audience at the Institute of Politics forum Friday evening, detailing his plans for Colombian social development and responding to pointed questions about the possibility that he will seek a third term in office.
Uribe was elected president in 2002 and retains an approval rating of nearly seventy percent due to the improvement in national security under his administration. He came to Harvard both to speak at the IOP and to celebrate the centennial of the Harvard Extension School, from which he holds a degree in management.
Uribe detailed the many ways his country has advanced in the past seven years, and he also laid out his vision for a stable and united Colombia.
“Colombia has seen many administrations that have not seen a single day of peace,” Uribe said. “Today, when my colleagues and I have a chance to talk with our fellow citizens, they request more police and more education, more army, more security, more investment, and more social opportunities.”
Uribe’s plan to seek a third term in office by amending the Colombian Constitution took center stage when he began fielding questions from the audience. Were Uribe to succeed, it would mark the second time he has passed an amendment in order to remain in power.
“The referendum that is pending to allow yourself to serve a third term could set a dangerous precedent for future leaders,” Jake Sloane ’12 told the President, before asking about Uribe’s reasons for seeking office yet again.
Other students took a more indirect approach. Juan Felipe Botero, a Harvard Law School student, asked, “What will be your advice to the person who shall replace you as President in less than a year’s time?” The question, which implicitly demanded Uribe step aside for the next election, drew enthusiastic cheers as well as approving laughter from the audience.
Uribe responded to both questions by pointing to political and economic gains made by his administration and stressing that the separation of powers in Colombia would prevent the unfair perpetuation of power.
Alex W. Palmer ’12, a member of the IOP forum committee, said he enjoyed the event despite Uribe’s somewhat evasive responses. “People like him got to where they are in the world by knowing how to spin questions to say what they want to say,” Palmer noted.
“It seems like he’s doing great things in Colombia,” he added.
Following the forum, Uribe was swarmed by dozens of students seeking to meet with him. He remained for nearly an hour in the forum room, speaking to students, taking photos, and signing autographs.

Leslie A. Kirwan ’79, the State of Massachusetts’ head finance official, has been named Faculty of Arts and Sciences dean for administration and finance, effective Nov. 2.
After decades working for the state government, Kirwan is a veteran of steering large organizations through fiscal crises: as the state’s secretary of administration and finance under Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 for the past two years, Kirwan has helped close a series of billion-dollar deficits.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith cited Kirwan’s “strong background” in fiscal management as a crucial quality she brings to her post in FAS, which is now facing a $110 million deficit.
“She has a history of building and leading strong administrative organizations,” Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson yesterday, noting Kirwan’s past work in organizations with “diverse” needs. “She is a strategic thinker and extremely well respected by those that worked with and for her.”
A former Cambridge resident who used to walk through the Yard every morning to high school, Kirwan said she is “very excited” to rejoin her alma mater as an administrator.
“The opportunity to match up my background at Harvard and my professional life was just too good to pass up,” Kirwan said in an interview with The Crimson on Friday. “I’m bursting with excitement to get to Harvard.”
As the secretary of administration and finance for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Kirwan has been responsible for developing the state capital budget and overseeing budgetary activities. In addition, Kirwan helped to implement the nation’s first statewide healthcare program that has aimed at universal coverage, as chair of the Health Connector board of directors.
Kirwan said that just as she has tried to make key investments at the state level in public education and healthcare in the face of gaping shortfalls, she hopes to confront the FAS’ remaining $110 million deficit as a challenge that requires her to both balance the budget and make “targeted investments.”
Her approach is reflective of Smith’s stated emphasis over the past few months of maintaining the quality of teaching and research in FAS while making cutbacks that will not affect the educational mission of the University.
“Economic cycles are an inevitable part of the job, and I would say that it requires discipline,” Kirwan said. “It’s important in all times to emphasize the sustainability of the core mission.”
Kirwan’s appointment comes after Smith announced in July that FAS Dean for Administration and Finance Brett C. Sweet would depart for Vanderbilt after less than a year at Harvard. With the key financial decision-maker slated to leave, Smith immediately began a national search for a permanent replacement. Smith said the search involved “a lot of candidates,” and declined to further elaborate on the process.
Until a replacement could be found, Catherine Gorodentsev—formerly the executive vice president’s chief of staff—assumed the interim role of FAS dean for administration, and Deena Giancotti—associate dean for finance—took up Sweet’s financial responsibilities.
Though Harvard has suffered from other recent departures—including those of former Executive Vice President Edward C. Forst ’82 and FAS IT Dean Lawrence M. Levine—Kirwan said she “would like to stay” at Harvard.
“I hope that I will be such a good fit at Harvard that it might be a long-term phase of my career,” Kirwan said.
She has been in communication with Smith and other FAS administrators about the post since August, she said. Though Kirwan will not officially begin her responsibilities until Nov. 2, she said she has reached out to professors she knows—including Economics Professor James H. Stock—so that she can start to build a network of faculty contacts, and she said she plans to review relevant readings and financial texts.
Kirwan, who graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School in 1984, is not unfamiliar with the terrain of fiscal management, as evinced by her years of service to the state. Prior to her role on the governor’s cabinet, Kirwan spent seven years as director of administration and finance at the Massachusetts Port Authority.
She also served as deputy commissioner at the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, which required her to manage the activities of over 2,500 state employees.
Though Kirwan has often had to lay off staffers because of budget constraints, she said that she always chooses to break the news herself, and confessed to tearing up at a meeting after having to personally lay off more than a dozen workers in Mass. Port Authority after Sept. 11 to push Logan airport back onto solid financial ground.
“It’s impossible to approach it without some emotion on behalf of the people whose lives are turned upside down,” Kirwan said. “If I ever get to a state in my life when I’m not troubled by the fact that economic challenges and budget reductions lead to personnel impacts, then maybe I should go into another field.”
But after years of experience in the throes of fiscal maelstroms, Kirwan said she understands that she often needs a light-hearted approach to the challenges of cost-cutting—namely, in the form of a stuffed Grinch doll that she sometimes brings to her office.
“I don’t have to make a heavy-handed statement about the constraints facing us. I can just show people the Grinch, and that’s a good way to just remind them that there are some hard choices to be made,” Kirwan said. “But if we approach them together in a spirit of shared responsibility, then we can often come up with a solution.”
As for whether she plans to relocate the Grinch to University Hall, Kirwan said, “That might be a little bit over the top for the first week.”
“I might bring him at Christmastime,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its inaugural meeting of the school year, the Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to establish a Budget Cuts Task Force, which the Council hopes will serve as a “centralized mechanism” for communication between students and the administration regarding budget cuts.
The ad hoc task force is charged with “coordinating all of the UC’s work as it relates to the budget cuts,” including advocacy for revisions to proposed cuts, recommendations for future cuts, solicitation of student feedback, and expression of student ideas and concerns, according to the legislation.
The task force is expected to work closely with the student life and College academics ad hoc working groups, which were commissioned in May by Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith to make recommendations on budget cuts to the administration.
“It’s really important that we have centralized mechanisms for us to communicate with the working groups,” Andrea R. Flores ’10, UC president and one of the co-sponsors of the legislation, said during the meeting.
“[Budget cut discussions] are going on in all dining rooms, all dorm rooms, in all UC committees,” said Mather representative and legislation co-sponsor Eric N. Hysen ’11. “The task force’s role is making sure all of those conversations are going towards a productive end.”
The ad hoc task force will be comprised of at least 5 UC members, who will be selected in an application process at the discretion of the UC Executive Board, though meetings will be open to all students.
Flores and Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 emphasized that student commitment and proper representation of all the UC committees would be important factors in selecting the members.
Although specifics of the task force’s operations have yet to be decided, Hysen said it is likely to be one of the most active divisions of the UC this semester.
“Our goal is to have [the task force] up and running very quickly,” he said.
The Council also passed legislation supporting the administration’s decision to consider reforms to the Administrative Board.
Based on the recommendations of a faculty review committee of the Ad Board, commissioned last year at the suggestion of the UC, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced several major Ad Board reforms at a Faculty meeting in May.
One reform reduced the size of the audience that students face in Ad Board hearings from 35 administration and faculty members to a smaller sub-committee. Students will also have greater flexibility if they wish to select an advisor other than their resident dean.
Another reform that will be considered by the Faculty this semester will broaden the range of possible sanctions for first-time academic dishonesty.
“The Ad Board hasn’t been changed in over a century,” said Hysen, who co-sponsored the legislation. “This is one of the more significant things the administration has done.”
“We should commend the administration when it does really good things for student life,” Flores said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe’s visit to campus drew passionate responses this past Friday, as a group of Colombian students presented the president with a letter criticizing his decision to seek a third term in office while a number of local residents protested outside Uribe’s speech at the Institute of Politics.
According to Juanita M. Goebertus, a student at Harvard Law School, a group of students from the Harvard Colombian Society collectively decided to write a letter to Uribe declaring their opposition to seeking a third term, a prospect currently prohibited by Colombian term limits.
The final letter, which the students presented to Uribe in person, garnered 30 signatures and stated that a third term for Uribe would “weaken the rule of law, as well as threaten the separation of powers of the Colombian state.”
Laura Jaramillo ’10, who was present at the meeting with Uribe and signed the letter, said she was impressed by the way in which he responded to each of their individual arguments against a leader remaining in power by amending the Constitution’s term limits.
“I think when we came in we were perfectly aware that we weren’t going to change his mind,” Jaramillo said. “But for many of us, it was a moral issue. We had the chance to sit down with the president of Colombia and to make a stand about something that is extremely important to us and to Colombian democracy.”
Those outside the Harvard community also protested Uribe by picketing on the sidewalk outside the Institute of Politics before the speech on Friday afternoon. Representing a number of different labor groups, immigrants’ rights organizations, and antiwar coalitions in Boston and Cambridge, they held signs in both English and Spanish with slogans such as “No Uribe, No More Death Squads,” and “Uribe: Fascist, Imperialist Worm.”
Uribe acknowledged the protesters in his speech, saying “Many have said ‘Uribe Paramilitar,’ ‘Uribe Fascista,’ but freedoms were restricted not because of the government, but because of the advance of terrorist groups.”
Protesters leveled several different criticisms against Uribe, though the predominant issues were his labor policies as well as his recent pledge to allow the United States to use seven Colombian military bases in order to combat drug trafficking.
“We are here because we are aware that Alvaro Uribe is president of the most repressive government in Latin America,” Richard Krushnic, a community developer from Newton, Mass., shouted over a megaphone.
Lyn Meza, a Chelsea, Massachusetts resident who serves as coordinator of the pacifist group Chelsea United Against the War, said she turned out to oppose the U.S.-Colombia military partnership.
“In these times of economic crisis and mass unemployment, we think the resources of the United States should be put to helping the people that are unemployed and not propping up military dictators around the world,” Meza said.

CORRECTION
The original version of the Sept. 27 news article "Locals, Students Protest Uribe's Speech" incorrectly stated that the Harvard Colombian Society collectively decided to draft a letter opposing any attempt by President Alvaro Uribe to seek a third term. In fact, it was a group of students from the organization who drafted the letter—not the entire organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps with the real Hermione Granger sitting on their side of the field, the Brown Bears could have borrowed her Time-Turner to reconsider their final play call. But in the muggle world, the Bears will have to live with their decision: down by only three points with under five seconds remaining and poised on the Harvard 25-yard line, Brown coach Phil Estes elected to keep his field goal unit on the sideline and take one last shot at the endzone.
Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero took the snap out of the shotgun formation and lofted the ball for wide receiver Bobby Sewall in the right side of the endzone. Sewall elevated to make the would-be game-winning catch as time expired, but senior linebacker Jon Takamura was there to make sure the ball did not end up in the hands of the Brown wideout as time expired. With the final whistle, the Crimson (1-1, 1-0 Ivy) took home its Ivy League opener, 24-21, in front of 17,263 fans on Friday night under the lights at Harvard Stadium.
“It was a good thrown ball, [and] I thought I was in good position,” said Sewall, who finished with 116 all-purpose yards and three TDs. “[I] went up for it, and there was a swarm of crimson there.”
Brown’s decision to throw for the endzone rather than attempt a 42-yard field goal that would have sent the game into overtime left many fans scratching their heads. But for Brown head coach Phil Estes, the decision was a no-brainer.
“I don’t have a kicker that can kick the ball that far,” Estes said. “I know what our kicker can do, and that’s not within his range. I’d rather throw it up to my three best guys and give them a chance to make the play.”
But for Brown (0-2, 0-1 Ivy) to simply get a chance to win the game took some magic in its own right.
With the Bears down, 24-14, with 3:07 remaining in the game, it looked as if Harvard would easily walk away with an early-season victory over the team it shared the Ivy League crown with last season. But thanks to an 80-yard touchdown drive and a recovered onside kick, Brown managed to put itself in a position to win the game with under a minute to play.
Starting at his own 20-yard line, Newhall—in his second career start—orchestrated an 80-yard touchdown drive in which he threw for seventy yards, rushed for ten more, and completed an eight-yard touchdown pass to Sewall with 34 seconds remaining. After Drew Plichta’s extra point attempt went through the uprights, the Bears had the Crimson lead cut down to three.
As Brown lined up for the onsides kick, Harvard knew all it had to do was come up with the football to all but ensure victory. But sophomore Alex Gedeon was unable to hold on to the 13-yard kick from Brown’s Nathan Lovett and Chimso Okoji recovered the ball for the Bears at its own 43-yard line with 32 seconds remaining.
Newhall’s opening rush for 18 yards and the subsequent pass to Trevan Samp for 14 yards placed the ball at the Harvard 25-yard line with under thirty seconds remaining and the Bears down by three. Newhall took three shots at receiver Sewall in the endzone, but each landed incomplete and Harvard snuck away with the victory.
“Brown gave us everything they possibly had, and we’re fortunate enough to squeak it out,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Though it wasn’t necessarily pretty in the last two minutes of the game, the kids finished it.”
Also making his second career start at quarterback was junior Collier Winters (two touchdowns, 223 yards), whose second-half heroics helped Harvard overcome a 14-10 halftime deficit.
On the Crimson’s second drive after halftime, Winters led Harvard with both his arm and his feet on a 92-yard drive that culminated in a three-yard touchdown run by the quarterback, giving Harvard a 17-14 lead it would not relinquish.
After a short rush by rookie Treavor Scales, Winters completed a 38-yard pass to junior wide receiver Chris Lorditch, who ran out of bounds at the 50-yard line. Winters scrambled for another 20 yards on the following two plays, then aired it out again, this time to senior wide receiver Matt Luft. Though Luft was unable to come down with the ball, a pass interference call on Brown’s AJ Cruz put the ball on the Brown 15. The drive finished with a designed quarterback run out of the shotgun formation, which Winters punched in from the three-yard line.
“Winters’ a smaller guy,” Brown defensive lineman James Devalin said. “He gets happy feet in there when you get a little bit of pressure on him, and he’s definitely a slippery player.”
The Brown defensive line, which ranked fourth in the nation in run defense last season, was only able to sack Winters behind the line of scrimmage on one occasion.
Winters padded the score on Harvard’s next possession, hitting Luft in the back of the endzone for his first reception and a 15-yard touchdown. After the referees initially ruled that Luft came down with the ball out of bounds, they deliberated and determined that Luft did indeed get his foot down.
“When you go up and catch the ball, you just automatically kind of kill your legs and try to drag them somehow,” Luft said. “There’s some difficultly level to it, but it’s stuff you kind of do all the time.”
Following a successful point after attempt from senior Patrick Long, Harvard sported the 24-14 advantage, which appeared to be a safe lead with just 12:37 remaining in the game. But the Brown comeback with just over three minutes to play put the game in jeopardy until Newhall’s last second pass attempt was unsuccessful, and the Crimson came away with the 24-21 victory.
“We were not a polished Swiss watch [Friday],” Murphy said. “We just played with great emotion and found a way to win.”

In the most anticipated game of the Harvard men’s soccer team’s season thus far, Wake Forest proved why it’s a national powerhouse.
The Crimson’s perfect record was marred by the No. 6 Demon Deacons Saturday evening in Winston-Salem, N.C. No. 8 Harvard (6-1-0) took its first loss of the season, 1-0, at the hands of Wake Forest (5-1-1) in a non-conference matchup.
Co-captain Andre Akpan proved ambitious once again as he fired three shots in the highly-anticipated matchup.
Though the Crimson men fell short, they displayed a strong defensive performance, led by senior Kwaku Nyamekye.
Nyamekye fired two shots on net and helped Harvard hold the Demon Deacons to just one goal. Crimson goalie Austin Harms had one save in the 90-minute affair.
Wake Forest allowed only one shot on goal from the Crimson men in the first half of the game off the foot of senior Andre Akpan, but the Demon Deacons’ goalkeeper Akira Fitzgerald made the save.
Fitzgerald notched his second shutout of the season, making three stops.
Early in the second half, Nyamekye fired back-to-back shots on goal. But Wake Forest would not allow Nyamekye’s effort to penetrate its stellar defensive shield—Fitzgerald turned both chances aside.
On the other end of the field, Harvard’s defensive effort wasn’t enough to contain the potent offense of Wake Forest.
“Wake Forest has been a top-five team for the last couple of years with a dynamic offense,” co-captain Brian Grimm said.
The Demon Deacons had their best chance at a goal in the first half in the 40th minute. Sean Randolph made a run down the middle of field and received Sam Redmond’s cross pass.  But Randolph’s header attempt from seven yards out sailed high to keep the game scoreless entering halftime.
In a slow-paced game, Wake Forest broke the scoreless tie at 61:29 with a goal from Anthony Arena. The freshman received the ball off a corner kick from senior Austin da Luz and placed it inside the left post from six yards out, putting his team ahead for good, 1-0.
It was Arena’s first goal of his collegiate career, and da Luz’z 29th career assist, tying a Demon Deacons’ school record.
Luke Norman and Zack Schilawski each attempted a team-high two shots for Wake Forest
The Demon Deacons’ offensive output for the game was unmatched by Harvard, as Wake Forest outshot the Crimson men, 10-7. Harvard, however, managed to produce out six of the seven shots on goal in the second half of the contest.
Both teams earned five corner kicks apiece. Four out of five Crimson corner kicks came in the first half while Wake Forest matched that with four corner kicks in the second frame.
According to Grimm, the Demon Deacons’ corner kicks proved to be the deciding factor in the match.
“For the most part we kept them at bay, but there was a corner kick that we got caught sleeping on, and it proved to be the difference,” Grimm said.
Although Harvard fell short to its non-conference opponent, the team proved it could stick with one of the top teams in the nation.
“We performed well and created a lot of chances, and although there was no luck on our side, we created a lot of opportunities,” junior defender Jaren LaGreca said. “Everyone stepped up and played well.”
Grimm echoed LaGreca’s assessment: “I think overall we had a good performance, and we’re encouraged by our team effort.We just fell short to an amazing team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After winning a game and taking ninth overall at the ECAC Championships at Princeton last Sunday, the Harvard men’s water polo team (4-8, 2-0 CWPA Northern Division) was ready to build on its first conference victory. The chance to do so came on Saturday with its matchup against Queens (2-9, 0-4), another Northern Division opponent. The Crimson defeated the Knights, 12-7, remaining undefeated in conference play.
“I think the whole team was happy to stay undefeated in the conference and to carry some momentum into California,” co-captain Egen Atkinson said.
Atkinson scored two goals in Harvard’s winning effort against Queens.
Rookie Max Eliot led the Crimson attack with a career-high five goals, in addition to three steals and four drawn ejections.
“We were just clicking as a team,” Eliot said. “My goals did not come from some amazing individual performance. Our offense just provided me with opportunities and I was able to capitalize on them.”
“Max has been playing well all year and something just clicked today,” said junior co-captain Bret Voith, who also scored in the game. “The first two goals really opened up our offense; opportunities opened up for everyone. I recognized that Max and others were playing really well. I just tried to take advantage.”
Voith was successful in his attempt, recording five assists in addition to his goal.
Harvard pulled together a balanced game on offense and defense. Seven Crimson players were able to score, and sophomore Alexandre Popp notched 15 saves in Harvard’s defensive effort.
“Their team had a few extremely strong offensive shooters,” Voith said. “[Popp] did a great job of recognizing the strengths of Queens’ shooters.”
“[Popp] made big stops and it was what we needed,” Eliot added. “It was a good win. It wasn’t a perfect game by any means; there are definitely a lot of things that we can work on.”
The Crimson seems to have taken the preseason losses it suffered early and turned them into motivation.
“We made a real effort to learn from our early losses,” Voith said. “We played a very strong schedule in the beginning of the year...It’s a good feeling to start off 2-0 in the league even though we struggled a bit in our first games.”
“We’re definitely on track to where we want to be in conference-championship tournament time in November,” Voith added. “These two wins help solidify in our minds that we’re moving in the direction where we want to be, that we can compete and will compete.”
Harvard had a record of only 3-8 coming into Saturday’s game, having suffered tough losses to George Washington, No. 11 Princeton, No. 16 Santa Clara, and divisional opponent Fordham. But the team’s resilience allowed it to bounce back from its slow start.
“We haven’t taken [the losses] as ‘things aren’t going well,’” Eliot said. “We’ve learned from those things and have been working really hard on them during practice.”
“I think the team attributes those [losses] to problems in our mentality going into games,” Atkinson said. “I think that’s improved tremendously. We used those games to sharpen our focus, which allowed us to win today. It’s good to get two wins against conference opponents who deserve our respect.”
With this win under its belt, the Crimson is looking to the Claremont Convergence tournament in California, which starts Friday. There, Harvard will take on a number of West Coast opponents.
“We’re going to continue to work on those fundamentals,” Eliot said. “The more we work on that, the better our games will be. That’s really important; we have to win our games so we can get a good seed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the Harvard women’s soccer team’s preseason, whenever the opposing team scored first, the Crimson would lose.
That all changed on Saturday when Harvard (2-5-0, 1-0 Ivy) faced Ancient Eight rival Penn (3-2-2, 1-0 Ivy) at home to start the Ivy League season. While the Quakers scored first and last, at the 12- and 70-minute marks respectively, Harvard took the middle by charge, burying three shots in the net to beat Penn, 3-2.
“I was so happy and excited,” senior goalkeeper Lauren Mann said. “I had no doubt that we [were] going to win. Still, after the final whistle blew, it was a great feeling that the team had worked hard the whole game.”
That hard work began right at kickoff, as the Quakers took control of the ball, firing their first shot three minutes into play. But Harvard reclaimed possession and took its first shot six minutes later with a wide header from freshman Alexandra Conigliaro.
As Penn goalie Caroline Williams punted the ball, the Quakers’ Laura Yu sent a pass to standout forward Jessica Fuccello, who shot the ball past Mann to tally up the first score of the game. Fuccello leads the league with nine goals this season, and 29 career shots.
“After the first goal, we all brought it in together as a team,” said Harvard junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh, who leads the Crimson with two goals this season. “We were prepared that they were going to score, and it was fine. We were confident that we could win because we had the rhythm of the game at that point.”
Harvard responded 12 minutes later after a pass by Conigliaro set up a scoring shot for senior Christina Hagner, her first of the season.
With the score tied, Harvard’s backline prepared for Penn’s retaliation, with freshman defender Taryn Kurcz and senior co-captain Gina Wideroff focused on picking up the ball before the Quakers’ Fuccello could touch it.
“The defense knew how Fuccello can be, so we made sure to know where she was at all times during the game ,and we kept her contained,” Mann said.
The middle of the match played out as a battle between Harvard’s offense and Williams, as the Crimson outshot the Quakers, 9-4, in the first half. With four minutes in the half, Williamson let another goal slip through as Harvard sophomore Melanie Baskind converted a pass from Sheeleigh into her first goal of the season.
With Harvard up 2-1 at the half, the Crimson knew Penn would come out of the break with retribution on its mind.
“We knew Penn was going to come out with a lot of intensity, so we knew we needed to match that and even be better than that,” Mann said.
But Harvard emerged from halftime aggressively, with Sheeleigh taking the first three shots of the half—two wide and one saved by Williamson. The next 45 minutes played out relatively equally, with each team attempting nine shots and each team scoring one apiece in the frame.
Harvard’s third goal came off of a penalty kick by senior Lizzy Nichols after Penn pulled Sheeleigh down in the box six minutes into the half.
The Quakers responded with a shot from Theresa Yankovich to make the score 3-2 in Harvard’s favor.
Unlike the past two years, where Penn beat the Crimson by one and two goals respectively, the Quakers could not convert another goal to force overtime, letting Harvard win with a final score of 3-2.
Not only did Saturday’s game provide the Crimson with a measure of retribution against Penn, but it was also a relief after a tough preseason saw the team only win one game against New Hampshire earlier in the month.
“We played tough games in preseason, and that was all to lead up and get us ready for these Ivy League games,” Mann said. “We took everything we learned from these games and just applied it on Saturday.”
Using the past games as building blocks, Sheeleigh claimed the team had finally learned to play together, play efficiently, and play with strong effort.
“We played to the ability that we knew we could, and we really came together as a team this game,” she said.  “It was crucial for us because it showed everyone that we can do this, we can have a successful season, and we are good enough to be competing and winning games.”
Going into next week, the Crimson will face Holy Cross on Tuesday as another tune-up before confronting the Bulldogs of Yale next Saturday and Fairfield on Sunday.
“Now we have to do that all over again every single Ivy League game to be as successful as we were last year,” Sheeleigh said.
Mann put it in basic terms.
“We just have got to keep it rolling.”

Playing on courts fresh from the U.S. Open several weeks ago, the Harvard men’s tennis team squared off this weekend at the BJK NTC Men’s College Invitational at the USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing, N.Y.
“It’s fun to play on a place where professionals play,” junior Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “The courts were really nice and obviously maintained well, it being one of the top tennis facilities in the world. At the end of the day, though, I view it as just another tennis court and a training ground to work on my game.”
In the No. 2 singles round of 16, freshman Andy Nguyen came from behind to defeat Kirill Kasyanov in a three-set match, 6-7, 6-1, 10-7, propelling Nguyen to the quarterfinals, where Nguyen got a break by defeating the No. 2 seed Phil Law, 1-0, after Law retired due to injury.
Nguyen’s run fell just short in the semifinals, where No. 4 Gilbert Wong rode an intense first set to a 7-6 (3), 6-1 victory.
In the same event, No. 3 Omodele-Lucien handled Joe Michalisin in straight sets 6-2, 6-3 but was set back 3-6, 6-0, 10-8 by Martin Kosut before being upset in the round of 16 by Christian Coley, 6-3, 1-6, 3-10.
“As far as singles go, I was pretty disappointed with my performance,” Omodele-Lucien said. “I didn’t really play my game that great, wasn’t seeing the ball that well, and was worried a bit more about winning than playing well.”
Sophomore Alistair Felton had a strong start in No. 1 singles by defeating Sho Matsumoto, 6-0, 6-2.  Felton then felt victim in a close match to Akash Muppidi, 7-5, 7-5, and couldn’t rebound before being eliminated in the round of 16 by Jon Jaklitsch, 7-6, 1-6, 6-10.
In No. 3 singles, senior Michael Hayes played at the No. 1 seed, making short work of Nicolas Pisecky, 6-1, 6-2, in the round of 16. Hayes proved his mettle in the quarterfinals when he came from behind to win one of the longer matches of the tournament, 5-7. 6-4, 10-8, against Pavel Cerny. But Hayes fell short in the semifinals, losing two close sets, 6-4, 7-5, to the eventual runner-up Loic Sessagesimi.
Omodele-Lucien and freshman Joshua Tchan were seeded No. 3 in the No. 1 doubles event and had an easy going early, winning two matches due to injury retirements and defeating Bandhari/Jaklitsch, 8-1, en route to an appearance in the round of 16.
The Crimson squad fell short in a close match, losing, 9-8, 7-6 (6), to Vloedgraven/Wong.
“Me and Josh are really starting to play well together,” Omodele-Lucien said. “He’s starting to learn the ropes fast, and that’s always a good sign.  The most important thing about these fall tournaments is building confidence as a team, and we’ll do that by working on the correct things and making sure in these tournaments we do what we do in practice. In general we need to worry about things that will kick in three months from now instead of worrying too much about the present.”
Michael Hayes and Andy Nguyen competed together in the No. 2 doubles event in the No. 1 slot, defeating Lin/Wong in a thrilling 9-8 quarterfinal victory.
After gaining slightly more breathing room in an 8-6 defeat over No. 4 Bernstein/Fife, the Harvard duo couldn’t complete the run, losing in the finals, 8-5, to No. 2 Muppidi/Schroeder.
“As a team, we use the fall to test our skills against the best competition and see how much we’ve improved from last year and see how far we have to go to become contenders in the spring,” sophomore Davis Mangham said. “There is less pressure, and you can really let things go and see how things are developing and how our team stacks up against the best players in the country.”
Up next for the Crimson is an Oct. 8 trip to Tulsa, Okla. where Harvard will compete in the ITA D’Novo All-American Tennis Championships, its first of three ITA tournaments this fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday Night Lights.
Many of the players on Harvard’s football team spent their high school years living for it—the roar of the hometown crowd, the pride in hauling in the winning catch, the simple love of the game.
And though in Ivy League football, the focus is shifted to Saturday afternoons in sparsely-filled stadiums, for one night a year, the Crimson gets to take a trip down memory lane.
“Playing under the lights on Friday night reminds you a lot of high school football,” said Harvard junior quarterback Collier Winters. “It takes you back a little bit.”
On Friday, Harvard took the field for the third annual night game at Harvard Stadium. And for the third time, the Crimson came away with the win.
In 2007, against Brown, Harvard took control with a late first-half touchdown and never looked back, riding out a 24-17 win.
In 2008, with Holy Cross in town for the season opener, the Crimson found itself down, 24-12, with less than 10 minutes to play.
But quarterback Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 took matters into his own hands, orchestrating two drives to the endzone and taking the ball himself twice to give the home fans a thrilling 25-24 win.
In the vein of last year’s comeback, Friday’s game had some drama of its own. But this time, it was the Bears threatening to erase a 10-point deficit in the game’s final minute.
After Brown’s star receiver Bobby Sewall brought down a touchdown pass with 34 seconds to play, Harvard fumbled away the ensuing onside kick, and a win that had seemed signed, sealed, and delivered just minutes before was suddenly in jeopardy.
On the last three plays of the game, new Bears quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero sought his favorite target—Sewall—at the right side of the endzone, hoping for another miracle touchdown.
But with the home crowd roaring behind it, the Crimson’s secondary held strong, with seniors Ryan Barnes and Jon Takamura batting away the last two passes to preserve the 24-21 victory.
Three games. Three wins. And the common thread?
Perhaps the lights make everything appear clearer to Harvard’s signal callers. Maybe the Crimson defense simply operates better after 7 p.m. But chances are, it probably has a little bit to do with the crowd.
Friday’s attendance was estimated at 17,263—thousands more than come out to any Harvard game against an opponent not from New Haven.
And a large number of those were rowdy, inebriated students—certainly a departure from most Saturday afternoons, when very few Crimson Crazies actually make it across the river for the game.
The night game has become a regular fixture in the fall social scene in Cambridge, and while in many ways it is viewed as a prelude to The Game—the tailgate is not nearly as big, and the stadium is still lacking 13,000 fans from the capacity crowd that shows up every other November—that doesn’t stop it from being a unique atmosphere appreciated by supporters and athletes alike.
“We’re very grateful for the support we got [Friday night],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It was a very exciting, loud, festive atmosphere. The three night games we have had have all been very exciting, down-to-the-wire football games, with big response from the student body and the Harvard community.”
There’s no question that the night game is one of the few times a season that the Crimson truly enjoys a home-field advantage.
In the fourth quarter Friday night, the fans got loud at all the appropriate times—when senior receiver Matt Luft’s feet just barely dragged through the endzone on a pass that was originally declared incomplete, when the game clock stopped working during Brown’s final drive, when the Harvard defense came up with stop after stop as the Bears sought the endzone and the win.
And watching the Crimson players on the sideline turn to the crowd and raise their arms, encouraging the fans’ roars as the seconds ticked away and Harvard’s first victory of the season became a reality, it’s clear that the athletes enjoy the atmosphere even more than the fans.
“It was just fantastic,” Murphy said. “As far as I am concerned, we could play a couple of them.”
While more than one Friday night game might be implausible—Brown and Holy Cross, the two teams to have played at Harvard Stadium at night, are far and away the teams closest to Cambridge—think about it this way:
The last three seasons, Harvard’s first victory has come at home under the lights. In the last two, it has been the first win on the road to the Ivy crown.
If this trend continues, the Crimson Crazies might find themselves under the Friday night lights a bit more often.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The question in everyone’s mind at the end of Friday night’s football game had to have been, “Why did Brown coach Phil Estes not send out his kicking team in an attempt to send the game into overtime?”
With 20/20 hindsight, the decision seems clear. But at the time, Estes had more to consider.
“We can’t kick it that far,” Estes said after the game. “That’s a no decision for me. That was an easy decision. I don’t have a kicker that can kick the ball that far.”
Poised on the 25-yard line, the field goal would have been from 42 yards out—surely a difficult kick, but also a makeable one. But for Estes, the memory of Week 1 was still fresh. In the Bears’ season opener against Stony Brook, Brown’s kicker Drew Plichta was called on to hit a 40-yard field goal with time expiring. The kick missed right and the Bears fell, 21-20.
Estes therefore went with arguably the two best receivers in the Ivy League—seniors Buddy Farnham and Bobby Sewall—in his attempt to win Friday’s game. But Harvard’s secondary proved too much.
“Those two receivers are great players, and we knew that coming in, so a big part of our game plan was we need to make sure we knew exactly where they were,” junior safety Collin Zych said. “The defensive coaches came up with some good schemes to contain them.”
MAN DOWN
Last year, quarterback Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09’s favorite target was then-junior Matt Luft. At 6’6, Luft could pull down anything thrown in his general direction. This year, the Crimson’s opponents recognize Luft’s threat and consistently put their best man on him. Last week, it was Holy Cross’ Michael Wright. This week, it was the Bears’ David Clement.
Whoever it is, this year’s play caller, junior Collier Winters, is having a hard time getting it to Luft.
“They definitely did a great job mixing up when they were coming up and jamming or dropping off,” Luft said of his Brown coverage.
But Winters has the advantage of a veteran receiving corps, any one of whom can come down with a big play, and at least through the first two weeks, it seems classmate Chris Lorditch is Winters’ man. The pair connected on five receptions for 75 yards on Friday.
THROWING IN THE FLAG
In an uncharacteristic move, Harvard outpenalized Brown, 11-5.
“You’re going to have some aggressive pass interference penalties, but just penalties in general is a concern, and it will be addressed,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “If you look at us traditionally, we’re a team that doesn’t beat itself. We don’t make a lot of mistakes.”
The 11 penalties charged to the Crimson accounted for 92 free yards for the Bears and put a damper on a number of Harvard drives, most notably a 60-yard breakout run by rookie Treavor Scales that got called all the way back because of an illegal block.
“Any penalty hurts, especially on a big play,” Winters said. “It just kind of takes the wind out of you. You know I didn’t see it, I don’t know, I’m sure it was a good call, but Treavor made a great play on that, broke a couple of tackles, made some great cuts, everyone was excited. You know, for that to be called back, you just have to regroup.”
But regroup Harvard did. Though the drive didn’t culminate in a score, the Crimson offense managed to chew up over four minutes off the clock, forcing the Bears to pack their comeback push into the final three minutes.
“We’re not as dominant in terms of personnel as we were a year ago, so we got to do all the little things,” Murphy said. “We’re not doing them all yet, but hopefully we’ll get to that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the entire first half, it looked like Harvard had Penn under control. It had patiently held off a strong Quaker offensive in the first half, survived three penalty corners in a row, and shifted the momentum in its favor. When sophomore Allie Kimmel scored at 27:08, it appeared that Crimson had stifled a Penn team and was about to send the Quakers to their fourth straight loss.
But Harvard was unprepared for the revitalized squad that took the field in the second half, as Penn rallied to a 4-1 victory at Jordan Field on Saturday.
“They totally had to wake up,” Penn coach Val Cloud said of her squad. “They played half asleep the first half so we really just told them, you know, if you want to lose again, you play like you are. If you want to win, you pick it up.”
And pick it up they did, scoring two goals in a minute to shift the scoreboard in their favor.
Both of these goals came on cross-field passes. On the first, Annie Matthews drove down the left side of the field, drew Harvard goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, and passed to Sarah Hasson, who flicked it in.
Tassopoulos made a big kick save on the fast break that followed, but Penn kept charging into the Crimson’s zone, with Sarah Hasson tipping in her second goal off a pass from Katie Rose. Hasson earned Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors for her effort.
While Cloud saw these goals as a sign that her team had found its fire, Harvard coach Sue Caples had a different take after seeing her young squad lose the composure that had defined it in the first half.
“I think the first half, and certainly the first 15-20 minutes, we had very good momentum, and we were patient, and we were moving the ball,” Caples said. “[But] we didn’t have enough to show on the scoreboard for it, and we needed to remain patient, and I think we allowed Penn to get in the game and settle.”
Caples added of the back-and-forth contest, “We knew that scoring one goal was not going to be enough.”
Despite being down 2-1, Harvard was able to regain control over possession but kept coming up short at the goal line. Quaker goalie Kieran Sweeney came up with big saves on a penalty corner and on a diving shot by junior Chloe Keating.  But with Keating and sophomore Carly Dickson moving the ball up the field, the Crimson began to gain momentum,
That is, until Cloud called another timeout.
“I noticed that Keating was now the center forward, and I wanted to make sure [my players] saw that she was there, and I put one of my good kids on her so that she wouldn’t be able to just do what she wanted with the ball,” Cloud said.
By shutting down the Crimson’s star forward, Cloud was able to trigger a change in her offense, and the Quakers scored shortly after the timeout.
That goal proved to be the back-breaker for Harvard. The Crimson was playing with just two subs, and it struggled to get back on defense and run the field. And with Keating hounded for much of the second half, the offense lacked its spark.
“[Keating] creates goal-scoring opportunities,” Caples said. “I’d target her too—she’s a great goal scorer.”
It was a Keating offensive drive that led to Harvard’s first-half tally.  Keating ran the ball up the left side of the field and fired it into the middle, where a diving Emma Keller fired the ball past Sweeney to an open Kimmel, who buried the uncontested shot.
“I think we played a tough game,” said Keller, whose hustle throughout the day was a bright spot for the Crimson.
Keller—along with classmate Tassopoulos and sophomores Kimmel and Dickson—are part of a young corps that has been forced to step up early.
“With a young team and an Ivy game, we will be better for this experience,” Caples said. “Obviously a disappointing outcome for us today, and it’ll be a real tough test for the team how they step up, because they don’t get easier. The games do not get easier.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling just short of the team title and claiming runner-up honors in its last tournament, the Harvard women’s golf team claimed its first victory of the season over the weekend, winning the Yale Fall Intercollegiate tournament, which took place at The Course at Yale.
The Lady Crimson played two rounds of golf on Saturday, and with the second day of competition being cancelled on Sunday due to early morning rain and a wet afternoon forecast, Harvard’s first-day efforts were good enough to bring the team trophy home to Cambridge, repeating the team’s finish from a year ago.
“Last year’s competition was shortened to 18 holes,” captain Claire Sheldon said, “so even though we were not able to compete on Sunday, it was good to have the tournament based on 36 holes this year.”
The Crimson shot a tournament-best 299 in the second round of play on Saturday to finish nine strokes ahead of the Lady Quakers from Penn, who entered the second round of the day 10 strokes ahead of Harvard.
“We feel great about our efforts this weekend,” junior Mia Kabasakalis said. “Saturday was a long day, but after the first round, we knew we had left some strokes out there. We were able to stay calm and make some adjustments after that first round in order to finish the day well.”
The third-year golfer from Alameda, California did not need to make many adjustments after pacing the Crimson with a five-over par 76 in the first round of competition. But Kabasakalis did indeed improve in her second tour of the Elis’ home course, shooting a team-best two-over par 73 to finish up Saturday’s play.
“My game has been going well,” Kabasakalis, who placed second overall, said. “I was able to drop some putts this weekend and hit the fairways and greens, really just taking one shot at a time.”
Rookie Katie Sylvan continued her fine freshman campaign with rounds of 77 and 76 over the 36 holes contested on Saturday, good enough to tie for sixth place individually. Sheldon finished just a shot back in a tie for tenth place with a total of 154 over the two rounds. A pair of sophomores from California rounded out the Harvard contingent, as Christine Cho shot 156 on the weekend for 17th place, and Jane Lee tied for 22nd with a total score of 158.
“Our team is all about the process,” Kabasakalis said. “We need to keep doing what we have been doing and we will continue to perform well.”
In claiming its first team victory of its fall campaign, the Crimson bested a quartet of Ancient Eight rivals, including the aforementioned Quakers and squads from Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth.
“It is always nice to compete against our peers,” Sheldon said, “teams that have similar commitments to us and are held to the same obligations academically. It is also a great confidence builder to be able to beat other Ivy League teams, as we will be facing them a lot more come the spring part of our schedule.”
Kabasakalis echoed her captain’s sentiments towards other Ancient Eight foes.
“Penn gave us a run for our money, but we were able to rebound in the second round and end up on top,” the Quincy resident said. “If we continue to focus on our own play, we will continue to perform well.”
Up next for the two-time defending Ivy League champions is a tournament in Bethlehem, Penn. hosted by Lehigh University in three weeks.
“The two weekends off from competition will be a more than welcome break,” Sheldon said. “We will be able to catch up on our school work and really settle in after being on the road the last three weekends.”
The Lehigh Invitational will be Harvard’s last competition of the fall, as weather usually inhibits play any later in the calendar year.
“We will begin out-of-season training after the Lehigh tournament,” Sheldon said. “This is when we can really work on making changes in our swings and in our games.”
While some tinkering hear and there may improve their games, head coach Kevin Rhoads might not want to make many changes in his Lady Crimson’s swings after performances like this past weekend’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard women’s volleyball team had Dartmouth’s number, claiming both contests against the Big Green.
This year, in the Crimson’s Ivy opener, the number was 3-0...in favor of Dartmouth.
In a disappointing start to Ancient Eight play on Friday, Harvard (4-8, 0-1 Ivy) dropped three-straight sets to an offensively-charged Darthmouth (5-6, 1-0) at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“It’s a matter of not playing selfishly,” sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll said. “We might have been a little freaked out today about the first Ivy game. If there’s one thing we could take into next week, it’s focus on the team.”
Next week provides the Crimson with an immediate shot at redemption. Harvard travels to Durham, N.H. on Friday to do battle with the Big Green once again.
“Hopefully, next week the score will be 3-0 Harvard,” junior co-captain Miyoko Pettit said.
Entering the first frame, the Crimson experienced problems in the back row, where Dartmouth successfully directed numerous attacks throughout the game. The Big Green took a slight 8-5 lead off of kills from sophomore powerhouse Madeline Baird and Crimson attack errors, but the home team regained its footing off of a powerfully-struck kill from freshman Taylor Docter. Soon thereafter, a block from junior Mikaelle Comrie evened the score at 9-9.
Coming back from a timeout, the Big Green responded with a 6-0 run that took advantage of Harvard misfires and miscommunication.
At 22-15, senior Lily Durwood launched a well-placed volley into a gap in the Dartmouth D, earning an unusual point and regaining possession for the Crimson. The efforts were not enough as the Big Green made up for the mistake with a 3-0 streak to win the set, 25-16.
Some of the miscommunication from the initial set lingered into the second; a set from senior Katherine Kocurek dropped to Harvard’s court untouched to put Dartmouth up 4-2.
Harvard fell back on its defense to generate a consistent tempo, with Comrie, Docter, and Ingersoll contributing much-needed blocking efforts to help boost Harvard to a 9-6 lead.
Defense proved crucial for the Crimson all night. Although Dartmouth put up six and a half blocks relative to Harvard’s six, and the two teams both totaled 60 digs on the night, scrappy defensive play kept Harvard in the game. Accepting the serve did prove to be a problem, though, as Dartmouth racked up eight aces on the night.
“Dartmouth was banging balls, and [the defense was] sticking in there,” Ingersoll said. “Dartmouth had a great block up, and that was tough on our hitters. That might have intimidated us a little bit. It’s something we need to get over.”
Without an effective offense, however, Harvard soon fell behind. The team as a whole was held to a .094 hitting percentage. Ingersoll, who leads the Crimson with 2.97 kills per set, managed only 11 against the Big Green.
Led by Baird, who dropped 16 kills against the Crimson, Dartmouth revamped its attack to tie it at 13-13. But a monstrous strike from Ingersoll that ricocheted off a Big Green defender and into the stands demonstrated that Harvard was not out of the game just yet.
The teams jostled for the lead, tying nine times throughout the third. Down the stretch, a haymaker from sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer gave Harvard a promising 20-19 lead. But a series of Crimson errors provided the Big Green with the opportunity to take the lead and run with it to a 25-22 victory.
One bright spot for the Crimson came in the form of freshman Jennifer Martin, who came up big to begin the third frame by diving around the back row, denying the Big Green with two bumps and allowing Harvard to eventually earn its first point of the set.
“She is a fireball—she was a spark tonight,” Pettit said.
The outside hitter only tallied two kills throughout the game but provided Harvard with more than stats.
“She pumps the team up when she comes in,” Ingersoll said. “We can all feed off her energy when we’re not there.”
Defensive efforts from Durwood and sophomore Christine Wu enabled Harvard to advance its attack; a long-range snipe from Docter put the Crimson up 8-5. Docter hit for nine kills throughout the night.
The Big Green clawed its way back to a 10-9 lead off of blasts from Baird and senior Megan MacGregor. From there, the two teams kept it close and frequently exchanged the lead. Dartmouth emerged on top at 18-16 and did not look back from there. Appropriately, the Big Green completed the sweep off of one final Baird kill that struck a Harvard defender and bounced wildly out-of-bounds.

Sounds reasonable. But the whole double-metal-bar-thing seems more intimidating than it should be. Look at what FlyBy found today.
This really raises some profound questions about the purpose of having books in the Dunster Library in the first place. For decoration? To permeate the hallowed room with an appropriately musty smell? For general authenticity, whatever that word means? Or, just so that the Dunster Library can be called....a library?
If it's for the latter reason, allow us to raise another question: is a book really a book if it can't be read? So, if these "objects" are not books after all, then perhaps this room is not a library either. Just sayin'. (Off with the bars!)

Peggy Noonan's Fall 2009 IOP Study Group is billed as a lesson on "Creativity in Journalism, in Politics and in Life: A Writer's Perspective". After reading Ms. Noonan's course syllabus, though, Flyby is slightly concerned that the said perspective might be a little clouded with alcohol-/society-induced narcissism.
Below are some of Flyby's favorite (annotated) selections from Ms. Noonan's syllabus:
And while we're living history, we have the "privelage" to ignore spell check and spel howevr we wnt, damn it.
Some more fascinating lessons from Peggy Noonan after the jump:
Every Tuesday. 4:00-5:30. IOP. Bask in my greatness. Fawn at my feet. Memorize my autobiography. (Oh, and did I tell you about being young and being the cousin of the wife of the college roommate of "the funniest man in Montana"?)
I mean, seriously. Go read my book like the rest of America. What, you think you're all special and "privelaged" because you go to Harvard? I mean, look at your school. They invite people like me.
Have you ever noticed Bill's coiffeur? And Barack - what fashion sense! I could have recommended George my manicurist, "having knows" the best ones in D.C.
A.K.A., me. If he's not me, he can't be that great. Obvi.
Or maybe they'll delete you, Peggy.
Finally! After eight weeks of talking about me, tell me why you're all here. What is this "politics" that you want to learn about?
FlyBy's Verdict: Take this class if you need further proof on why you should go into consulting.
And of course, any Harvard class wouldn't be complete without its Q Guide Ratings. So here are the numbers for Peggy Noonan 101:
Difficulty: 4.5 (it's hard. to fill in. the gaps. between fragments.)
Workload: 1.0 (because, unlike Expos 20 - or any other class you've ever taken - you won't be required use complete sentences or correct spelling)
What was/were your reason(s) for enrolling in this course:
0% Elective
50% "I had to. I'm her study group liaison."
48% "I want to go into journalism but am too lazy to do 'reporting' or 'editing.'"
2% "I like people who speak to me like I'm in 3rd grade."

Last night’s sunset marked the beginning of Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. A day of repentance and spiritual cleansing, today is also the day God decides whether (or not) to inscribe an individual in the Book of Life for the upcoming year.
According to tradition, Jews fast from sunset last night to sunset today and do not bathe, wear leather or perfumes, or engage in “marital relations.”
So, if students are walking around in suits today but don’t look to be headed to a consulting interview, chances are they are going to services - an ideal distraction from the tummy rumbles.
Services will be held around campus throughout the day. The list of times and locations is after the jump.
Reform:
10:30 am - Morning Service (Memorial Church/Harvard Yard)
1:30 pm - Family Service (Memorial Church/Harvard Yard)
4:00 pm - Afternoon Service (Memorial Church/Harvard Yard)
Conservative:
9:30 am - Shacharit, Torah Reading & Musaf (Harvard Hillel)
5:00 pm - Mincha/Ne'ilah/Ma/ariv (Harvard Hillel)

With October being Vegetarian Awareness Month and World Vegetarian Day coming up on Thursday, Oct. 1, the lovely ladies in charge of the Harvard College Vegetarian Society have recently announced that the group will begin having monthly lunches in the Lowell House dining hall to encourage more people who are interested in vegetarianism or veganism to join a community of like-minded consumers.
Anello said that, although the Veg Society’s email list contains over 200 names, a far smaller number of students show up to regular club events. She and co-president, Jessica M. Luna ’10, hope to encourage members of the club and other interested students to participate in campus-wide and Boston-area events going on throughout the month.
Learn about upcoming veggie festivities after the jump.
The Harvard Coop will be hosting a book signing by members of PETA to promote the organization’s new Vegan College Cookbook (complete with free food samples!) on Oct. 6.
The Harvard Veg Society will also be organizing a vegan baking workshop at the end of the month.
But what’s got FlyBy most excited? The Boston Vegetarian Food Festival comes to town on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, boasting hundreds of vendors and free goodies for everyone who visits. Happy (meatless) eating!
