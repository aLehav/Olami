After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s admissions webpage proudly displays the following mantra: “No American College is More Affordable.” Just this year, Harvard announced that families with annual incomes below $75,000 won’t have to contribute to the cost of attendance — a marked increase from the previous $65,000 threshold. Impressive statistics are scattered all over the financial aid page; 55 percent of students receive aid, 19 percent of undergraduates are on Pell Grants, and remarkably, everyone can graduate debt-free. Students, for the most part, do not have to worry about the cost of their education.
Diversity, another traditional talking point of elite universities, is a second point of emphasis on the admissions webpage. Resources, ranging from initiatives like the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program to information for prospective undocumented students fill your screen as you scroll down the page. Harvard represents over 100 countries, with each student bringing a perspective that is “deeply tied to their culture, background, and experiences.” Similar to its narrative about financial aid, Harvard justifiably boasts about its racial and geographical diversity on campus.
Harvard highlights these facts on its admissions website because it wants to create a simple, and powerful, portrayal of its mission. The best students from around the world — regardless of disadvantage — have the opportunity to benefit from a Harvard education. Meritocratic social mobility in its purest form.
Social mobility is the pillar behind our intuitive predilection for robust financial aid and affordability. Financial aid is not intrinsically good; it does not categorically create benefits right off the bat, rather, it allows low and middle-income students to graduate debt-free and reap the full benefits of a Harvard education. Financial aid levels the playing field and ensures social mobility for all students, not just the wealthy.
Diversity rests on the same logic. Beyond creating a stimulating learning environment, the presence of students from underrepresented backgrounds at Harvard ensures that the benefits of an Ivy League education are not concentrated within any one racial or cultural group. It can feel odd to bluntly assert that we want underprivileged students to become financially successful; however, this is the obvious message lurking directly under programs seeking to increase access to Harvard. Social mobility as a goal for underrepresented individuals shouldn’t be obscured or qualified in any way — it is one of the core goals of diversity.
Creating this special role for social mobility — the unambiguous goal of Harvard’s financial aid and diversity initiatives — allows us to view the success of these programs from a new perspective, beyond the statistics provided on the admissions website.
When a student in the bottom fifth income quartile matriculates to Harvard, they have a 58 percent chance of becoming a rich adult. Only 41 schools, out of 2,137, in the country are better at enabling this type of growth for low-income students. Despite this, Harvard is one of the worst colleges in America in terms of overall social mobility — safely within the bottom 10 percent. Nearly 2,000 schools in the country are better at having students move up two or more income quintiles. The root of this failure is Harvard’s inability to recruit and admit a significant amount of low-income students. Only 4.5 percent of the student body comes from the bottom quintile of familial income, compared to 67 percent that comes from the top fifth. It’s hard to have social mobility when most students already rest at the top of the income bracket.
Harvard’s financial aid and diversity statistics are hollow. While they sound great during info sessions, they mostly serve as a machination, implying social mobility where it doesn’t truly exist. Fifty-five percent of students receiving aid sounds impressive until you realize that hundreds of students whose parents make $200,000 are receiving scholarships and only 4.5 percent of the school is low-income.
Looking at financial aid and diversity statistics are important, but they obscure what truly matters: worthy and disadvantaged students using Harvard as a vehicle for social and economic improvement. What does Harvard have to brag about if only 1.8 percent of its students come from poor families and become wealthy? This number is striking, and sits at the core of what Harvard needs to improve upon. Impressive scholarships and representation amount to a public appearance of meritocracy while in reality, Harvard remains a place where social mobility is essentially stagnant. Until this changes, the college’s statements about affordability and access fall completely flat.

GENED 1038: Sleep was once known to be the gemmiest of gems. It fulfills Harvard’s Science & Technology in Society General Education requirement without demanding excessive hours in a lab or long nights working on dense problem sets — a gift from heaven for more humanities-inclined students like myself.
Still, the course offers a compelling introduction into an important field of scientific research. The class is taught by leading researchers who have dedicated their careers to understanding the relationship between the circadian pacemaker and wake-sleep homeostasis, conducted cutting-edge studies on topics like the effect of light exposure on melatonin secretion before sleep and the cardiovascular impact of circadian misalignment, and assisted professional athletes in crafting their sleeping routines. All this expertise to help students discern the answer to one question: Why do we sleep?
This Fall, however, students will have to work harder to seek an answer: Sleep has ceased its gemminess and become a hard, old rock. It seems the Gen Ed Gods deemed the course too much of a gift to struggling humanities students, with a number of changes seemingly having been made to increase difficulty. This semester, in-class quizzes have been instituted at the start and finish of each class.  Students must now sit for a cumulative final exam worth 30 percent of their course grade which takes the place of the old 10-page term paper.
Harvard’s attempt to re-create GENED 1038 is wrong — not because it makes our lives harder, but because to de-gemify Sleep is to defeat the class’ essential purpose: to promote student wellbeing.
Sleep is a mental wellness class. Alongside mini-assignments designed to introduce us to scientific research skills and readings on key concepts, a significant portion of the coursework is spent using software to track and reflect on one’s own sleeping habits. A survey, completed every morning and evening, asks basic, quantitative (e.g. “What time did you try to fall asleep? and “What time did you finally wake up?”) and qualitative questions.
Being a qualitative Sociology concentrator, I took interest in one in particular:
“For each of the following, indicate how you feel right now by clicking on each line and adjusting the sliders.” (The line stretches from “Stressed Out” to “Calm / Relaxed”).
Each day of our sleep diary period, I have had to wake up and mindfully consider how I feel. I’ve noticed that, as soon as the day starts and the assignments pile up in my brain, I consistently self-evaluate more stressed out than calm. Generally, though, I feel fine.
I asked a friend, another senior who’s taking Sleep to save time for work on their thesis, whether they had a similar experience.
“No doubt,” they said. “I’m never above 50 percent.”
Surely, we’re not alone in feeling this way. Is there something wrong with us?
No, not really. Our stress is a by-product of Harvard’s environment. Most students who come here were superstars in their hometown. Even if we don’t mean to be competitive or performative, we are — that’s what got us here. As such, if you don’t watch out, your identity can quickly reduce to the things you do. How many midterms do you have this week? When’s your next case interview? How’s leadership on that extracurricular going? Before you know it, all you can say about yourself is your elevator pitch for your thesis or your name, year, house, and concentration.
But, who are you? Like, really: who… are… you?
The most powerful way we can counter this grave reality is to wake up every morning and make a conscious decision to rest. This is my non-scientific answer to the age-old question about sleep’s function: It forces us to remember that we are not simply what we do — that we are so much more. Sleep is a mini-Sabbath.
The faculty of the Sleep Gen Ed and members of the Committee on General Education have a choice: to join the revolution of rest or to succumb to the system. I applaud class faculty and teaching staff for the progress thus far. It is not easy to structure a class one way and then to restructure it in the opposite. In a welcome change, in-class quiz questions seem to have become easier and readings have lightened, but the work is unfinished.
Sleep is one small part of the constant fight to prioritize student well-being over performance, and we’re winning. It is time for administration, professors, and students to have broader conversations about our school’s culture — to envision a world where academics don’t have to worry about quantifying class performance or productivity to prove themselves credible. Where students smile in lecture because they know their professors care. Where we transcend the fog that falls during midterm season and we see each other for who we are.
In a pile of cold, hard stones, Sleep can be a gem again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As University President Lawrence S. Bacow (colloquially known as Larry) announced his intent to step down from his position this summer, I could not stop thinking about another Larry who resigned from Harvard’s presidency not too long ago. Former University President Lawrence H.  Summers, a provocative economist known to not sugar-coat his beliefs, ended his tumultuous term in 2006, his already-tense relationships with some faculty strained after delivering controversial remarks at an economics conference a year prior. Summers’ departure, which occurred before the term “cancel culture” entered our collective vocabulary, foreshadowed a dark trend for academic freedom.
Summers became the object of faculty ire after hypothesizing about the lack of women in high-end STEM positions. In unofficial remarks before the National Bureau of Economic Research, he posited three potential reasons women are underrepresented in top scientific positions, including “different availability of aptitude at the high end,” a theory that was informed by a scientific study and statistical calculation. Summers was greatly criticized by faculty and international media for these remarks, culminating in a lost no-confidence Faculty vote; upon a motion to face a second no-confidence vote around a year later, Summers would resign. Although some of Summers’s critics offered a substantive rebuke of his remarks, others railed against his speech without articulating an intellectual counterargument, walking out of the room to avoid hearing his reasoning.
Since the departure of Summers, other professors have experienced similar attempts to reign in their voices. Dr. Carol Hooven, who studies sex differences, publicly suffered her colleague’s wrath when she discussed the difference between biological sexes and criticized the use of the term “pregnant people.” Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker also encountered mob fury for years-old tweets that linked to New York Times and Washington Post articles about racism and police brutality. More recently, Professor Jonathan Haidt, a prominent social psychologist who researches the psychology underpinning people’s moral beliefs, resigned from his post at NYU after being told he was only allowed to publish research that advances “equity, inclusion, and anti-racism goals.”
Alone, these events are tragic incidents in which an academic fell into trouble for his or her research on controversial social issues. Together, they represent a disturbing pattern of social censorship.
According to Harvard’s conservative faculty, productive political discourse on campus is only becoming more difficult. This should not come as a surprise, given Harvard’s high-profile treatment of Summers, which made national headlines and might as well have proclaimed to the world that Harvard would no longer tolerate diverse academic speech.
While hate speech should be policed, Harvard must allow conservative speech on campus without the hostility conservative professors report facing. A speech like Summers’, lauded by many economists — including Lee Professor of Economics Claudia Goldin, who studies women’s academic and professional progress at Harvard — found valuable, is not worthy of censoring.
Promoting ideological diversity and an open exchange of ideas is a prerequisite for the pursuit of truth that Harvard so seeks. Progress is inhibited when norm-questioning perspectives are silenced. Shutting thinkers down over their academic work is dangerous.
Events like the pressure campaign that ousted Summers from office have a chilling effect on academics. University faculty saw Summers turned into a pariah at the hands of people who criticized his remarks, not on their merits, but because they were judged misogynistic. They saw the mob prevail against Summers’ defenders, who invoked John Stuart Mill’s “On Liberty” during the debate preceding the faculty vote. Faculty learned not to question prevailing orthodoxies. Veritas went out the window.
As one Larry prepares to leave Massachusetts Hall, the memory of a different Larry must be top of mind for the presidential search committee. The only way to rectify the chilling effect wrought by Summers’ exit is to select a president who prizes academic free expression, and is willing to signal that Summers’ ousting was wrong for a prestigious institution like Harvard. Harvard’s academic free-expression problem is much larger than the resignation of a single president, and its cure will require much more than a new president. However, a loud champion of free speech — one who will actively work to recruit diverse perspectives and welcome academic arguments of any political persuasion — would help address the dialogue deficit on Harvard’s campus.

As the search for the University’s next president progresses, Harvard has the opportunity to rectify a historical wrong and atone for a blight on its record, while addressing a larger disturbing trend about academic free expression. The time has come to lead colleges in academic speech, to return “semper” to “semper veritas.” Harvard’s atmosphere is ripe for a change of weather. Anything less would be disloyal to our motto.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Harvard students may have heard, or even said, this infamous line before: “I go to a school just outside of Boston.” But being “just outside of Boston” doesn’t mean that Harvard has nothing to do with Boston. In fact, Harvard is one of the largest property owners in the city — without paying any property taxes.
Since 2011, however, under the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program, Boston has instead requested that nonprofit organizations with property holdings valued at upwards of $15 million — a designation which includes Harvard — voluntarily contribute 25 percent of the property taxes they are exempt from paying.
This year, like every year since PILOT’s inception, Harvard has failed to fully comply with Boston's PILOT request, contributing $10.8 million, which amounts to just 79 percent of the city’s recommended amount of $13.7 million. Additionally, less than half of Harvard’s contributions this year were actual financial disbursements: A total of $6.8 million was paid in
“community benefits credits” — the estimated financial value of Harvard initiatives that are considered of benefit to Boston residents. Initiatives such as the Harvard Law School Pro Bono Program, summer academies for high schoolers, and the Arnold Arboretum fall under this category.
To be clear, we support initiatives that serve local communities. But for such initiatives to account for more than half of Harvard’s PILOT contributions seems disingenuous, especially considering that they rely on the labor of students and volunteers that often do not get paid.
While once again disappointed by Harvard’s actions, we are no longer surprised. As we have opined previously, Harvard is not exactly a model neighbor. From its lackluster Town Gown relations with Cambridge to contentious expansions in Allston, we have repeatedly identified a need for Harvard to be more supportive of its neighbors; this is only the latest example.
For an institution that prides itself on nurturing the next citizens and citizen-leaders, Harvard’s own ability to fulfill its civic duties is questionable. How can Harvard teach responsible leadership when it refuses to lead responsibly in the very communities it resides in? Unfortunately, our university is not alone in dropping the baton: Other nearby universities such as Tufts University, Boston University, and Boston College have also failed to satisfy their PILOT requests. Harvard, along with these peer institutions, should move to pay these dues in full in order to enrich the surrounding community.
Above all, we believe that the real scandal is that institutions as wealthy as Harvard can be tax-exempt for property ownership in the first place. The state of Massachusetts should take legislative action to ensure that Harvard pays a fair, standard property tax at the state level. The specific clauses of such legislation and the extent to which it should be extended to other institutions, of course, are up to actual legislators.
But for now, we just ask our University to fulfill its PILOT requests. If paid in full, Harvard’s contributions can generate a meaningful increase in tax revenues for Boston — an increase that, with so many potential benefits, we see no reason to not support.
Some traditions are worth breaking: As Harvard moves to exit the chapter of its history under President Lawrence S. Bacow, who is set to step down in June 2023, we urge the new President and general administration to revisit the institution’s contributions and correct past inadequacies. This new chapter of Harvard’s history is not yet defined, but we hope it will feature at least one thing — Harvard’s renewed support for and commitment to the city it resides in.

When you swing open the bright blue-painted door to Bryn Mawr Bookstore, you’re greeted by soft chimes and a plethora of books. Spines ranging from lightly stained to barely bent cover every inch of the walls; every turn reveals a new bookshelf. On the checkout counter sits a small gold handbell waiting to be rung by customers. The bookstore is home to thousands of used, rare, and out-of-print books, the purchases of which fund scholarships for its namesake, Bryn Mawr College.
The shop is run by student volunteers looking to fulfill the college’s community service requirement and retirees looking to occupy their free time. Some days, the workers are welcomed by nearly 10 boxes of donated books which each volunteer sorts, designating each book to its most appropriate section.
Along with processing donations and interacting with community members, the volunteers also work to cultivate the homey ambiance of the bookstore. Before the pandemic, they organized events such as Easter egg hunts and Halloween celebrations; certain volunteers are known for their exceptional efforts to welcome customers.
“We have some famous people,” says Ruth L. Mittell, a bookstore volunteer.  “Sydney’s a particular volunteer that makes tea for customers. People know to come by when she’s on, and often she bakes cookies on Thursday afternoon[s].”
Before there was the bookstore, there was the book sale; students looked forward to the annual market of used books organized by long-time Harvard staffer Elizabeth E. Butterfield in 1957. Butterfield, an alum of Bryn Mawr College, accepted donations with her husband in a trunk on their porch. Donations often came from professors moving abroad, writers who had accumulated hundreds of books looking to clear out their shelves, or any local Cambridge resident. The books were sorted and priced on a ping-pong table in Butterfield’s basement. Butterfield’s daughter, Hester Butterfield ’65, remembers hundreds of books being dropped in the trunk. “They were sorted very methodically,” she says, recalling how her mother and father scrutinized each book before etching the price in pencil.
The location of the annual sale varied from year to year, often taking place in farms, churches, and, for a few years, in Sanders Theatre, says Butterfield’s son, Fox Butterfield ’61. In 1971, the Butterfields decided to establish a permanent storefront for the donated books at its current location in East Cambridge.
“A lot of the books sold those days for 10 cents or 25 cents. Maybe a really, really important book might go for $1,” Fox remembers. Even with those prices, the sale raised over $25,000 annually for Bryn Mawr students when the average annual cost of attending a four-year college was $2,725.
Aside from working to raise scholarships at the bookstore, Elizabeth also helped students through her work as the secretary to the dean of Radcliffe College. Later, she moved to the Registrar’s office at Harvard.
Besides her reputation for helping students navigate administrative webs, Elizabeth is remembered as a social activist. She was an organizer of Harvard’s Peace Action Strike coalition, a group founded in 1970 to protest the United States’s involvement in the Vietnam War. In further support of the cause, Elizabeth played a leading role in the closing of many Harvard offices in grievance of the students who lost their lives in the Kent State shootings.
In her activism, Elizabeth also foregrounded educational equality. Fox remembers delivering newspapers to people who did not have the money to pay him. Instead of withholding their delivery, Elizabeth would cover the cost of their subscription. “It was an important lesson for me,” Fox says.
Elizabeth passed on her commitment to higher education to Hester, who attended Radcliffe College. “Successful women come out of these scholarships,” Hester says of the Bryn Mawr Bookstore scholarships. “This is what my mother was building on. Women should get educated, be smart, and be independent.”
After learning that a new male co-worker, whom she had trained, was receiving a higher salary than her, Elizabeth resigned from the Registrar’s Office and worked instead as the secretary to the Social Studies Department, where she worked until her death in 1978.
Elizabeth’s legacy is still visible in the bookstore, where a section of books authored by “Notable American Women” brims with the works of famous feminist figures such as Emily Dickinson and Maya Angelou. A suffrage-era banner reads “VOTES FOR WOMEN” in a striking shade of red coupled next to a Bryn Mawr College flag.
“We want education to be available for women who might have trouble affording it, and we think that there is a reason for women’s colleges to still exist,” says Anne S. Dane, a volunteer of almost 40 years and a Bryn Mawr alum. Dane says she used to receive short profiles of the scholarship recipients which helped her connect with each woman’s story.
In celebration of the bookstore’s 50th birthday, volunteers took themselves back to the 1970s as they placed furniture on the street and filled the sidewalk with sounds of drums, horns, eating, and laughter. Dane says she can see the bookstore maintaining Elizabeth’s vision for decades to come.

A few weeks ago, I did something bizarre. I was sitting in the dining hall, reading a book when my friend approached me from behind and, peering over my shoulder, asked me what I was reading. Almost immediately, I slammed the book shut and spluttered, “Oh, nothing.”.
As the conversation moved on, my eyes turned to the cover of my Colleen Hoover novel, which I had so shamefully hidden. The truth is, I was embarrassed. I had bought the book solely because of a TikTok video, with thousands of likes and comments raving about Hoover’s “It Ends With Us.” Having been up all night ripping through its pages, I had come to several conclusions: It was a terribly written book; it was repulsively predictable ]; and most importantly, I loved it.
My shame of being found reading Colleen Hoover stemmed from a culture of intellectual snobbery — feeling superior and prideful about the type of culture you consume. It’s the person who prides themselves on their knowledge of “classical” literature, listing off the last names of authors such as John Milton, Charles Dickens, and Jane Austen as if they are family friends.
High culture is the tastes and interests of the educated and elites: the obscure film festival winners, the prestige, and classism. It is inherently exclusive and labels what is enjoyable — and traditionally not regarded “meaningful” — as “trashy.” Trashy then becomes associated with low culture, the tastes and interests of the masses. It’s the viral shows, the highest grossing films, or the “must have” romance novels in the airport convenience store windows.
David M. Levine, a Theater, Dance, and Media professor, described intellectual snobbery as “automatically excluding materials from intellectual consideration because they give immediate pleasure.” Being an intellectual snob means feeling superior to e mass culture, due to the status and inaccessibility of the type of culture you consume, literary and beyond.
Intellectual snobbery can feel especially pervasive at Harvard, where books like Hoover’s are rarely on reading lists. But her work was clearly popular amongst the masses – number one in the New York Times Best Sellers List as of January 2022. It was an easy read with a simple plot.
While I talk incessantly and shamelessly about the trashy TV shows I indulge in, I didn’t approach literature the same way. I began to question why we view trashy television and trashy literature so differently and how those differences tie into intellectual snobbery.
English professor Stephanie L. Burt notes how “low-status prose fiction,” and “low-status television” are seen differently for several reasons, the primary being history.
“Literature has been associated with prestigious institutions like Harvard for centuries,” Burt explains. “People go to these institutions to be connected to traditions of prestige and power. High-culture literature fiction lives at Harvard.” Television is not historically tied to Harvard in the same way. Thus, while the dining halls may fill with talk of “Love Island,” they seldom seem to be alive with chatter about the Colleen Hoovers.
Apart from the historical construction of high culture that places greater stakes on what literature should convey, literature is also uniquely subject to gendered stigmas used to evaluate the content of its stories. For example, part of my embarrassment with reading Hoover has to do with the perceived lack of depth in romance novels. The book had no greater storyline other than the ups and downs of a predictably toxic and abusive relationship. There were no greater life lessons, no philosophical truths, or groundbreaking theoretical points. It was just a compelling story about a terrible couple.
Romance, as a literary form, has long been seen as a women’s genre, and not without good reason: 84 percent of romance novels are read by women, according to a 2014 survey by Romance Writers of America. Burt says that older people, especially men, often judge the things teenage girls enjoy as “bad and dangerous” using their own misogynistic metrics of what defines culture.
Looking forward, I aim to indulge in as much trashy literature, especially romance novels, as I do trashy television. I aim to look at reading as a pleasurable activity, not an academic subsidiary. I aim to break free from the Harvard norms of attaching prestige and rigor to literature, and enjoy these plots and authors, even if they would rarely be found on reading lists. I aim to appreciate the trashy romantic genre, without putting undue pressure on women to read and write stories with traditionally respectable cultural motifs.
Taking Professor Levine’s advice, I want to consume “art for art’s sake..” And the next time I’m caught reading Colleen Hoover, I will proudly share the title and show the cover to my friends.

For much of my life, I wanted to be a professional actor.
I had been acting as long as I can remember: school plays, acting classes, the whole nine yards. It was a central, if not the central, aspect of my life, and pursuing it professionally just felt natural. But after one pandemic, some substantial self-reflection, and a fortuitous rejection from the University of Michigan’s School of Music, Theatre, & Dance, my plans had changed. Driving this shift — beyond not wanting to consign myself to a life of auditions ad infinitum — was the realization that I couldn’t handle it at that caliber. That I just wasn’t good enough.
One might think coming to terms with my deficiency would have been a serious blow to my self-esteem. But in truth, I found it liberating. I had unburdened myself from a self-inflicted and fierce pressure to excel. Finally armed with an honest and rational evaluation of my middling skills, I was actually excited to continue acting in some amateur capacity.
In other words, I looked forward to having a hobby.
Hobbies fill leisure time with the rewarding experience of making art, engaging in a craft, or being active. But the value — or properly put, the joy — of hobbies lies not in their end result, be it a painting, a wooden spoon, or a seven-minute mile. Rather, it exists in the activity itself. In the New York Times, Tim Wu described this joy as the “gentle pursuit of a modest competence, the doing of something just because you enjoy it, not because you are good at it.” Free from the pressures of excellence, we can take pleasure in the wide range of available human activity in a low-stakes, experimental way.
In my mind, college felt like the perfect setting to sample it all. Like every new freshman last fall, I marched eagerly into the student activities fair, signing up for email lists, collecting club merch, and marveling at the expansive range of options. It felt like nothing was off-limits. Naturally, I got myself on a theater email list, and ended up going to a couple auditions.
But callbacks rolled around, and nothing had come of my efforts. In retrospect, it was probably a good thing that my acting career that semester had ended. Certainly, experiencing this denial within weeks of coming to college stung. It registered that I’d had my first acute feeling of failure at college. But I was also unprepared for what might have come had I actually started acting at Harvard: demanding schedules, intense commitment, dedicated competition. Of course, Harvard students are highly skilled, and self-select into student organizations in the disciplines they’re best at. They often have professional experience in their craft, be it acting or otherwise, and produce rigorous, high-quality work. Against this background, it felt as though I’d have to hold myself to a pre-professional, if not professional, standard of work — a far cry from the experience I was looking for.
I ended up joining — and then backing out — of several clubs that semester. Many of Harvard’s student organizations, it became clear, required several hours out of a week or an already high level of skill or experience. I started missing meetings or forgetting about applications. Deadlines came and went. From the other end, I felt a pressure to commit more and more to the handful of groups I wanted to take seriously, crowding out the possibility of activities with genuinely low commitments. As the year progressed, I felt the scope of my engagement narrowing toward activities I felt confident I could succeed in, excluding opportunities to try new things. Underneath the stress and fatigue from an overfilled schedule was an intense fear that I would fail, that I wouldn’t learn quickly enough or couldn’t produce work of a given caliber. So I bailed, and that felt like failing too.
If the pursuit of excellence can deter us from embracing failure on a semesterly basis, the demand for productivity all but prohibits us from doing so on any given day or week. Any given hour should be spent getting ahead (or catching up) on work, networking, thinking about one’s professional future — something of value. Especially at Harvard, this way of thinking is often necessary, if nothing else, to meet the demands of intense coursework. I’ve found myself, at the end of many long days, rounding up all the hours where I could confidently call myself “productive.” The resulting figure looms in my mind as a measure of worth. It’s important, it seems, to take the skills we’ve got and put them to use: reading, studying, or just doing something that we can point to and say, I completed this. This was the value of my day.
And it’s not just hobbies. In the age of social media, we face pressure to be — and look — successful even in our personal lives.
Think of one of those glossy, day-in-the-life-of-a-Harvard-student TikToks: wake up at 6:15, run a half-marathon, finish an essay, redecorate your room — all before breakfast. Is it vulnerable or honest about the reality of being at this school? Or is it playing to an aesthetic standard of what a Harvard student is supposed to be: personality, friendships, and academic success, all in one? These performances feed into a perception, however misguided, of students at Harvard and other elite universities as universally capable and flawless super-students, without even the possibility of failure.
Maybe this type of social media behavior is targeted to an outside audience, looking to grow a network or for a rare moment of virality. Or maybe, it’s playing to an even more corporate force: the possibility of brand deals, sponsorships, and influencing. Of course, it’s only natural; companies are always looking for the possibility to connect to the Harvard brand, and students — not unreasonably — are always looking to make some money. But commercializing our social media presence blurs the line between leisure and business, further linking personal life and success.
And we are at the end of this equation: friends and fellow students, told to buy this or download that, all staked on the social identity of the seller. Of course this involves marketing oneself. Excellence and success sell; failure and vulnerability do not. The most effective social media persona is the kind of life the rest of us want to emulate. It says, be me.
What would it mean to be publicly vulnerable, to be open about failure? Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana provided one potential model for this last month in an Instagram post outlining his experiences of academic and professional failure: rejections from jobs, schools, academic journals. “There is something cathartic about putting your failures in front of you,” he wrote. Giving a name to these experiences of failure, Khurana correctly observes, it becomes possible to accept them.
I’m trying to be better at failing. I want to do things that bring me joy, even though I know I’m mediocre at them: acting, doodling, Mandarin, chess. Setting goals each day, I try to be realistic about my own capacity for productivity. When I inevitably procrastinate and fail to meet them, I try to give myself grace. I’ve all but stopped posting on most social media, because I know I can’t disguise myself as the prototypical, polished Harvard student.
Even with this piece, I’m worried about failure. This is a radical departure from all the reported stories I’ve ever written at The Crimson, and I can’t help but worry about backing out from fear and failing to complete the Fifteen Minutes comp — or worse, failing to meet a standard, being compared to other, similar works that are not only passable but stellar. But like Khurana says, writing this piece has been cathartic. Surrounded by what seems like a sea of excellence, publishing my experiences of failure feels painful, but necessary. I’m practicing failing every day. And I feel more successful than ever.

Hidden in the Harvard Forest, located in Petersham, Massachusetts, grows a 110-year-old red oak tree. Through trunk swells and leaf fall, it stays rooted, watching from eight stories above the forest floor.
This isn’t just any aged tree — this is what is known as a witness tree. Witness trees are, by definition, any tree that has experienced historical events through its significant age and location. Many well-known witness trees were present for major Civil War battles. In the case of the one at the Harvard Forest, these historical events have less to do with military and politics and more to do with the climate and ecology of the forest.
This particular witness tree has a research team composed of Harvard’s Tim Rademacher and Clarisse M. Hart, along with Boston University’s Taylor Jones. The three of them have outfitted the tree with sensors tracking its growth, leaf changes, and sap flow. This information is important to indicate the overall health of the forest, but it also has a second purpose: filling the tree’s Twitter account, @awitnesstree, which automatically posts friendly updates about the tree for an audience of almost 11,000 followers.
Rademacher, who started the project, was inspired by TreeWatch, an initiative based at the University of Ghent that tweets out technical data about trees throughout Europe. He wanted the witness tree’s account to take data and make it personal and digestible for people with little scientific experience. He says that facts and data are “super interesting for specialists like me who understand what a sub flex of 3.5 centimeters per hour means,” but they are “not that meaningful for a larger audience.” Rademacher says the intent is “making the tree the protagonist of the story.”
From Ents in The Lord of the Rings to Yggdrasil, a tree that serves as the world’s foundation in Norse mythology, Rademacher believes that trees naturally attract human connection. Both Rademacher and Hart appreciate the importance of assigning an identity to the tree while supporting it with objective data. “There is an inherent human urge to communicate with nature, and with trees in particular,” Rademacher sayssaid. “Trees are always seen as wise, trustworthy, and honest.”
Combining ecology and communication is where Hart comes in. She holds degrees in both environmental studies and nonfiction writing, and she did a project during her PhD studies on “nature-based Twitter communication” at UMass Amherst. “We actually thought a lot about the voice of the tree,” Hart says. “It’s, like, friendly, but still really kind of science-y.”
Her strategy is to publish three types of posts: audience-building posts which publicize the account via hashtags, data-driven posts which share particular information about the tree, and interactive posts where the tree will “answer” questions or send “selfies.” These posts are automated via a code designed by Rademacher and his student, Kyle Wyche, using recently gathered data and photos to fill in the team’s pre-written messages.
The tree is connected to an archive of climate data that Harvard Forest has collected since 1964, showing the audience the extent of what the tree has witnessed. “When it says it’s a hot day, it’s not just saying it’s a hot day,” Hart says. “It’s comparing it to 50, 60 years ago, in a way that we as humans can’'t do.” The team uses this information to help the public become more passionate and engaged with issues of climate change. Hart notes that the posts that receive the most comments are the ones that are climate-themed.
Hart and Rademacher agree that there is a “dystopian” undertone in using social media to encourage people to care about nature. But as Hart says, “I also recognize that you need entry points for people, and if this is an entry point, great. If this keeps nature top of mind for people, great.” Rademacher says that “any tool is good” if it motivates people to combat the world’s current climate and biodiversity crises.
The witness tree team is currently working on expanding the project with three new trees housed at Drumlin Farms in Lincoln, Massachusetts, Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, and Cambridge Common. The most urban tree to date, the Washington Elm located in Cambridge Common, claims to have borne witness to Washington taking command of the American army and Cabotians walking to the Quad. The gray headstone to its left marks Boston history, while a small gray box attached to the trunk with wires running through the tree’s yellow leaves collects present-day data.
Because of pandemic- and technology-related delays, the Washington Elm will not start speaking to us until after its dormant season — but it’s still speaking. “You can’t look at a tree and see that it grows, but it grows,” Rademacher says.
With the addition of new trees comes the need for updated technology. Using grant money from the Harvard Climate Change Solutions Fund, Jones is developing more cost-effective, compact, and precise sensors that can be used in urban environments.
Rademacher and team hope these new trees can serve as educational tools for K-12 students, creating a gradient of trees from rural to urban so students can compare data across different ecologies. The project is running teacher workshops, developing lesson plans, and building a website so that the tree’s data is accessible in schools.
On November 6, the Harvard Forest will take visitors to the location of that original witness tree for the first time, which has been kept secret to avoid foot traffic and equipment damage in a key study area. Another motivation for this secrecy is the lack of anything particularly noteworthy about this tree. “I don’'t think it’'s useful to create hype around this particular one tree and then people want to visit,” Rademacher says. “What’'s much more useful is to think about the tree just outside of your window.”
Rademacher is taking his own advice: the next tree he hopes to add to the witness tree network is a “French-speaking” sugar maple right on his own sidewalk in Canada.

On the crisp fall morning of Oct. 15, I join a curious and peculiar group assembled outside the Cambridge Water Works facility exchanging parking permits for bikes and scrounging donuts and coffee provided by the Cambridge Water Department. We’ve all assembled to participate in the 9th annual Cycle To The Source tour of the Cambridge Watershed offered by CWD — a rare opportunity to bike the watershed’s route alongside Water Department staff.
Cambridge retirees make up a large contingent of the tour’s participants, all experienced recreational bikers. Suffice it to say, I was out of place — 40 years the junior of most tour-goers and riding a bike intended for a mid-sized child, while many came prepared with lavish road bikes.
The event was largely organized by Anna Van Dreser, a Birkenstock-clad department staffer who was eager to share the department’s work with participants. Van Dreser serves as a watershed management assistant, which is a fellowship-like position for recent college graduates.
In addition to the tour, CWD offers a bevy of other educational events throughout the year, including a tour of the treatment plant, workshops on invasive species, and an outdoor festival. By working with advocacy groups and community organizations like the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation, they’ve also expanded their ability to protect watershed land.
Four staffers from CWD’s Watershed Management Division, which runs the tour, biked alongside the participants: Dave Kaplan, ​​watershed manager; Jamie O’Connell, watershed supervisor; Anna Van Dreser, watershed management assistant; and Julie Greenwood-Torelli, director of water operations.
At each stop, the staff implore us to imagine life “as a water drop,” taking in our scenery the way raindrops may absorb pollutants or be purified by the forest plant life.
Edward Carney and Stephen Conway, our Carhartt-clad guardian angels for the day, bring their bright orange work truck, stocked with food and Cambridge tap water, to every stop along the route. As reservoir caretakers, they patrol the watershed, operate the dams, and perform regular maintenance.
Cambridge is unique in the Boston area for having its own watershed and water source. Most municipalities in this region rely on the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which provides them with wholesale water from Central and Western Massachusetts.
However, due to drought and other challenges, Cambridge has elected to source its water from the MWRA, an emergency backup measure for its otherwise self-sufficient water system, for the remainder of 2022.
Cambridge’s watershed system was built in the 1890s. Now, it sits amidst residential communities in the towns of Lexington, Lincoln, Waltham, and Weston. And where there are people, there are pollutants. Thus, the Watershed Management Division is always working to mitigate pollutants and frequently negotiates with developers to ensure that new construction doesn’t threaten the watershed.
But they can’t win every battle. Interstate highway I-95, built in the 1950s, now runs through the middle of the watershed and is a challenge for CWD. I-95’s roadway deicing operations lead to elevated sodium levels within Cambridge’s water year-round, while fuel spills and other hazmat incidents on the roadway pose an acute risk to the system.
Currently, the pollutant on CWD’s mind is Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, or so-called “forever chemicals.” PFAS can be found in pizza boxes, cleaning products, water-resistant clothing, or non-stick pans. This year CWD staff observed elevated PFAS levels, which were expected to be highest in September. At the same time, in part due to climate change, CWD was facing the longest drought since 2016, which was itself the longest drought since 1966.
As we reach our final stop of the day at the Stony Brook Gatehouse, we’re reminded of the challenges that the department continues to face. As one staffer explains, the dam (and the Cambridge water system) is not currently providing any water; the CWD elected to change to MWRA water for the fall season starting Aug. 30 due to ongoing drought and to allow for the installation of new filters to bring PFAS levels into the undetectable range.
While the gatehouse should normally be echoing with the sounds of water rushing through its gates, it now stands silent.
Regardless, the public servants of the Watershed Management Division continue to patrol each day — keeping the watershed safe until new filters and more rainfall allow the CWD to reopen the dams. They are eager to hear the rush of water once again.

Christopher J. Nowinski ’00 was watching his two- and four-year-old children, while the Sept. 29 Miami Dolphins vs. Cincinnati Bengals football game played in the background.
Suddenly, the tenor of the game shifted: the Dolphins’ star quarterback, Tua Tagovailoa, was slammed into the ground, hitting his head. He lay on the turf for more than seven minutes, grimacing and squirming, and was then carried off the field on a stretcher and brought to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion.
This was not Tagovailoa’s first head injury; just four days earlier, following a hit to his head during a game against the Buffalo Bills, Tagovailoa stumbled and was immediately removed from the field. After evaluation from medical attendants, Tagovailoa cleared NFL concussion protocol and continued playing. However, some, including Nowinski, suspect that Tagovailoa did, in fact, sustain a concussion in the game against the Bills.
Upon seeing Tagovailoa go down during the game against the Bengals, Nowinski turned away from his TV screen and tweeted: “​​This is a disaster. Pray for Tua. Fire the medical staff and coaches. I predicted this and I hate that I am right. Two concussions in 5 days can kill someone. This can end careers. How are we so stupid in 2022.” He racked up nearly 45,000 thousand retweets.
This is not the first time that Nowinski has spoken out about inadequate concussion policy in professional sports. A former Harvard football player and World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler, Nowinski has personal experience with concussions.
Part of the reason Nowinski cares about this advocacy is that he did not receive adequate education about concussions when he was younger. “I had likely been getting concussions throughout my whole athletics career, I had just never said anything because I didn’t think that the symptoms were worth mentioning,” he says. “I sort of ran my brain into the ground out of ignorance about this.”
After graduating from Harvard with a degree in Sociology, Nowinski had a brief stint as a consultant at Trinity Life Sciences, but he was not yet ready for office life and decided to give wrestling a shot. In 2000, he joined WWE, which involved both wrestling and dramatic, partially-scripted banter between athletes and commentators.
This combination of sport and drama was perfect for Nowinski, who “dabbled” in acting while at Harvard, joining an improv group his senior year.
But everything changed when Nowinski suffered a concussion in 2003, forcing him to retire from WWE just three years after he entered the ring.
His concussion led to spiraling effects, including chronic headaches and extreme sleep disorders. After several attempts to find a suitable doctor, Nowinski landed on Robert C. Cantu, who was able to diagnose him and was the first to inform Nowinski that he had likely been suffering from concussions throughout his athletics career. Under Cantu’s treatment, Nowinski fully recovered but remained passionate about preventing concussions for fellow athletes.
In 2006, Nowinski published Head Games: Football’s Concussion Crisis from the NFL to Youth Leagues, a book that discusses the negative health effects of head injuries for amateur and professional athletes. Though Nowinski was able to find agents to represent his “passion project,” he says it didn’t sell well because “there is no market for the spoken truth.”
Most of Nowinski’s book focuses on concussions, but one chapter discusses Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. CTE is a disease caused by repeated head trauma with symptoms that include memory loss, confusion, and impaired judgment, and can lead to the development of mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Though there are no ways to diagnose CTE while patients are still alive, many NFL players have been diagnosed with it after death. Nowinski, who went on to receive a Ph.D. in behavioral neuroscience in 2017, continues to research CTE today.
Nowinski also leads the Concussion Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit that he co-founded with his former doctor, Robert Cantu. CLF seeks to change the culture surrounding concussions in athletics by educating young athletes and their parents, partnering in studies with CTE researchers, and hosting publicly broadcasted workshops on how to recognize the signs of concussion.
Nowinski’s favorite part of the job is working with the families of people whose brains are donated to the “brain bank” which CLF uses to research brains of potential CTE patients.
This research is especially important to Nowinski since Chris J. Eitzmann ’99, a close friend of his and former captain of the Harvard football team, died six months ago. His brain was donated to the Boston University CTE Center for research.
Still, Nowinski is optimistic about the future of football and other contact sports and believes that we will find a way to diagnose CTE within the next five years. When asked if he would allow his kids to play contact sports, he responds, though slightly hesitantly, with “yes.”

Anne Harrington ’82 received an undergraduate degree in History and Science from Harvard and then received a modern history doctorate from Oxford. She is the Franklin L. Ford Professor of the History of Science and also serves as the Faculty Dean of Pforzheimer House. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Could you tell me about your favorite class that you’ve taught?
AH: The hardest class, but also the class that in some sense, has meant the most to me, was my Gen Ed class on Madness and Medicine. That course probably shaped me, surprisingly, as much as it shaped the students I taught. In the end, it inspired me to write a book that was published in 2019, called “Mind Fixers,” that I dedicated to the students in that Gen Ed class. I became convinced that I was unable to do justice to one of the most important developments in the recent history of psychiatry, and I was inspired by the questions asked by those students to figure out the answers. Why is it that so suddenly, and without much warning, the whole field of American psychiatry pivoted away from previous psychotherapeutic and psychosocial understandings of what mental suffering is? How come, sometime in the 1980s, everyone’s decided, apparently, all together, that it’s all about drugs, it’s all about chemistry, and it’s not about context or biography? There had been no new science and no new treatments to justify it. So there needed to be a different explanation for why we ended up in the world that we did.
FM: Why did that shift happen?
AH: The field of psychiatry had been dominated by the psychoanalysts and the psychosocially oriented thinkers that embraced a very expansive vision of what they were doing that hardly seemed like it had anything to do with medicine at all. That came back as a starting point for a whole wave of radical critiques of the mental health professions, which argued that they seemed more in the business of disciplining people than of curing them, and that there doesn’t seem to be any medical agenda here, so why are they claiming to be doctors?
There was a very major project that they had undertaken that had to do with emptying the mental hospitals and moving people into the so-called community that was inspired by this broad way of thinking. And it was the families of many of the patients that had been moved out of the hospitals and into the so-called community that pushed back and said, “It’s time to re-medicalize.” They provided a space for the biologically oriented psychiatrists who had been out of power to step up and say, well, the field has pushed itself to a point where it’s at risk of making a laughingstock of itself. Of course, there’s such a thing as mental illness; of course there’s a biology to mental illness; we need to get back to brass tacks.
What the general public tended to believe was that there must have been a biological, scientific reason for the shift in power, but it was really more of a rhetorical move. It was one in which they said, put us in power and we will figure out the biological basis of schizophrenia and depression. Give us money, have a “decade of the brain,” give us MRI machines, and we will figure this out, but they really never did.
Right now, the field is in a place where there is a tremendous ambivalence about psychiatry’s ability to really say what it knows or doesn’t know about mental illness. And, I hope, maybe an appetite to pull back from hegemonic ways of thinking about what causes mental illness and bring back voices that got marginalized in the ’80s.
FM: History of science combines two different fields into one. What distinguishes it from history?
AH: There are a lot of universities where history of science is simply embedded in history departments, so it’s a very fair question. We are a university where it’s been decided that there is value in having a separate department. And the benefit of maintaining the separate department is that it allows us to expand the purview of things that can be studied. We offer students this opportunity to combine historical studies with in-depth scientific coursework, to produce social and scientifically literate social scientists.
FM: To be a good historian of science, how much actual science should you know?
AH: It kind of depends on what you’re measuring and what you’re doing. I couldn’t have written my book “Mind Fixtures ” if I hadn’t understood the biochemistry and the pharmacology. I don’t think it’s an ideological position that you have to have a certain amount of science in order to do the field well, because it would depend on the question you’re asking. But I do think you ask more interesting questions as an historian of science, if you really lived in the world of science in some sustained way. There’s something about the hands-on experience of doing science that makes you a more thoughtful historian.
FM: What do you try to do to make sure that you’re up to date on what’s going on in the science world? 
AH: For six years, I co-directed Harvard’s Mind Brain Behavior Initiative, which had the wonderful educational value of exposing me on a very regular basis to how scientists think and their understandings of where their fields were going. You embed yourself in a community that pushes you, and that Mind Brain Behavior Initiative was a wonderful way to do that. I also have close colleagues in the psychology department.
FM: How did you get into history of science?
AH: I came as a first-year thinking I had figured everything out and I was going to be an English concentrator. I thought science was just tedious things you had to learn in textbooks, and I didn’t see the beauty.
Then everything fell apart in a really constructive way. Basically, I felt the world was too dangerous to simply become an English person. I continued to love English literature and wrote poetry and did all these other things, but I was very, very worried about nuclear war. I took a Gen Ed class called “The Astronomical Perspective.” The instructor invited scientists who had been involved in the Manhattan Project to come to class. I remember going into Science Center B, and I was very worried about the world blowing up, and these are the people that had done it. So who were these giants who had brought these godlike powers into the world? I came in, and they were these little wrinkly gray guys who basically said that they hadn’t quite appreciated all of the implications of what they had done, and got all caught up in the technical interest of the project, and then they basically said they saw no solution. It was going to be up to us to figure out what to do about all the awesome and horrible powers they brought into the world. I left Science Center B furious with the grownups.
And then it became, well, how do I live with my anger and my fear? And history of science became a kind of responsible avenue for working through my quarrel with science, for trying to understand the disconnect between the scientific developments and moral responsibility. So I kind of went to the history of science initially to try and save the world. But it was a kind of a dark space in the history of science that I moved into, and it actually wasn’t where the love was. The love for me was really about where human beings fit into the universe, and I was fascinated by consciousness. It seemed to me to be the most mysterious thing because everything else was big, empty, silent space and then one infinitesimally tiny bit of the universe woke up and looked around, and I couldn’t wrap my mind around this, and I didn’t think the scientific story made any sense of this.
In the end, I ended up following the love rather than the fear. I got involved with the history of the brain sciences and all the sciences that are interested in the human mind, but then found other ways to connect that interest to the kind of activist impulses that originally brought me into the field, but now focused more on social justice and equity and centering human suffering and looking at ways that the scientists do or don’t do justice to it and alleviate it.
FM: Who’s been a mentor in your life and what impact did they have on you? 
AH: As an undergraduate, one of my mentors and sources of inspiration was a now retired but still living emeritus professor of the history of science, Everett Mendelsohn. At this point in time, I decided I wanted to go into academics, I wanted to get a PhD. But I was worried that if I did that, I would lose touch with the social activist instincts and concerns that I had. Wouldn’t I just become part of the ivory tower? But he had been someone who had, throughout his career, maintained a very strong commitment to important social causes and intellectual and scholarly agenda.
I went to him as a senior, and I was very shy back then, so it took a lot of courage for me to ask him, how had he done it? And one of the nicest things happened. He said, “That’s a really good question, and it’s too important a question to just answer on the spot, let’s go have lunch.” And he took me out to Bartley’s Burgers and he talked to me about how he had done it. Basically, he said, you just have to make a commitment. There won’t be time leftover, there’s never enough time, but you make a commitment, and you carve the time out, and you make it part of your life. And that freed me to go to graduate school and become a professor.
FM: Is there anything that you are trying to do now in that activist mindset, bringing that forward?
AH: I think of my book “Mind Fixers” as an intervention and not just a piece of history. I’m in the process of developing a project that will look at the brain disorder, actually, and what would happen if we told stories about say, neurology or the brain sciences in ways that didn’t assume that the only interesting actors were the scientists and the doctors, but centered the neurological patient and their families. There’s this profound ethical and political power in that simple act of re-centering. So, my activism is not as much as it used to be about going out, getting on buses to go to DC. It’s now much more about offering alternative possible ways of making less visible people visible to the people in power.
FM: What lessons do you think that people in modern times should be taking from the history of science to deal with mental health now?
AH: One of the things you notice, if you look at the history of the mental health care system, is the repeated arrogance and the premature claims to victory. I actually have a tremendous amount of respect for mental health care workers. But there are structural factors that have tended to prioritize professional status and profit over less profitable and less prestigious needs of suffering people.
What if it turned out that one of the most important things you could do for a chronically and seriously mentally ill person was not to discover what’s wrong in his or her brain or even find a better medication — that’s not saying that’s not important — but the best thing you could do for that person would be to get them an apartment. That might not feel medical, and then maybe that doesn’t feel like it’s aligned with the professional goals of the field, so then you have to share power.
One of my hopes is that we might be able to move to a world in which there is an ecosystem of mental health care workers, some of which have a medical mission, and some of which have a psychosocial mission and some have much more of a social worker mission, and that there is a mutual respect and sharing of power and understanding that whatever we do in any single moment we center the patient.
I think people will respond to what I’ve just said, by saying, oh, we do that. They’re already social workers and clinical case workers and psychologists. And that’s not wrong, but it tends to be organized within a hierarchy, where the medical mission and the biological vision and the research agenda stands at the top of the totem pole. And I just feel if we could flatten our hierarchies, and deepen our knowledge of what helps on across all of these spectrum of care that patients need, it would serve the patients better.
FM: In a 2018 survey, some 46 percent of Harvard students reported mental health concerns. What do you think needs to be done to support them?
AH: This is a question that universities and colleges across the country are asking. Harvard students are both unique, and also very typical in the sense that it’s been exacerbated, as we all know, by the isolation and the strains and anxieties brought on by the pandemic. I don’t want to give a glib answer like, “here’s what we should do.” What I would say, though, is that not all forms of mental suffering or mental distress are necessarily disease. Suffering from anxiety may or may not always be best served by embedding the understanding of what’s wrong and how to fix it in a medical model. If we allowed that there could be a spectrum of things that could help, some might involve medication, some might involve therapy, some might involve speaking to a chaplain. I think we constrain our ability to help people by prematurely medicalizing all forms of distress.
FM: What is your favorite thing about being Pfoho House Dean?
AH: It gives me an excuse to play. I have to take people snow tubing, it’s my job, what can I do? I have long kind of felt it’s been a not-so-secret excuse to have fun in ways that I probably wouldn’t allow myself otherwise. Not everything always has to be deep. The house system and the things that we do can bring some lightness to everyone’s life, including the faculty deans’.
FM: What’s your favorite Pfoho house tradition? 
AH: We have a program called Pfoho Pforays, and they are excursions that follow the arc of the seasons. In that, the thing that has been the most amazing foray we’ve done has been a four-day dog-sledding and winter camping excursion. We take about 20 students to western Maine, right near the Maine-New Hampshire border, and they learn how to mush teams of sled dogs and spend two nights sleeping out in canvas tents by a frozen lake.
FM: Do you have a favorite place on campus that you like going to?
AH: I think the Quad is great, I really do. How can we move people’s minds and hearts a little bit on this issue? You go on to the Quad lawn on a sunny day with Adirondack chairs, and maybe there’s a mom with a baby toddling around, and kids are there doing their homework, and the sky is blue, and it’s so peaceful. It’s just like a home.
FM: What do you tell freshmen who are sad about being Quadded on Housing Day?
AH: I say come up and see us. As a place to live, and as a community in its own right, I think once people get up there and see the amenities and meet the people, they wipe away their tears and they settle in.
FM: On the Pfoho website it says that you think ice cream should be its own food group. Of all the ice cream shops in and around Harvard Square, what’s your go-to?
AH: Partly because I like ice cream so much, I don’t go too much. Honeycomb Creamery is the fancy place. I actually quite like J.P. Licks, that’s my go-to if I’m with friends or family. Toscanini is a little bit out of the way, but when I go kayaking with students, we go to Toscanini. How can you choose? It really depends on the mood, the moment, where you are. Ice cream is always good.

I was snuggled in my bed catching up on House of the Dragon after a particularly grueling eight-hour shift at work when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a creature run under my desk. I assumed it was one of the cockroaches with whom I share my little room — one landed on my head and escaped into my laundry bag a few weeks ago; another one scurried across the floor when I turned on the lights one morning. But a little while later, I locked eyes with a furry little beast as it traversed my carpet and snuck under my bed, smugly wiggling its long, flaccid tail.
Luckily, a quick Google search for “mice harvard” led me straight to an FAQs document about mice infestations compiled by Campus Services. Unluckily, it fucking sucks.
At the end of the day, my very lovely roommate Katie found the phone number of the Harvard Operations Center, who sent two very lovely technicians to set up traps in my room. But the document’s bald condescension stuck with me — as did the mice, who attempted a visit to our common room a few days after.
Below, I have selected the best musings from the Mice FAQ, all of which didn’t actually point to a tangible solution nor number to call, but rather provided me with a nice chuckle during my dip in the alphabet soup of Harvard bureaucracy. No comedic enhancements are necessary — here are real quotes taken from the aforementioned doc for your amusement:
“Adult rats are huge in comparison to mice, but a young rat can – at a distance – easily be mistaken (by persons) to be an adult mouse. The names afforded to these beasts in different languages further confuses the conversation. For instance, in Spanish, ‘el ratón’ translates to ‘mouse’, and ‘la rata’ refers to ‘rat’. The beasts, of course, don’t care what you call them, as long as you don’t call them late for dinner.”
“We never had mice before, why do we have them now? 
Many notable Harvard alumni certainly experienced and survived encounters with mice. Although such events may not have been desired, the experiences may quite possibly have had positive influences on the graduate’s career and perspectives in appreciating nature and in responding to life’s little challenges.”
“Can’t I just get a cat?” 
“There are traps around, why don’t they work?”
“The mice are causing me great stress and loss of sleep. What else can be done to help me? 
Sharing your home or workplace with unwanted guests can contribute to an already stressful life. Resources are available to help manage stress, regardless of the cause. Students are encouraged to reach out for help to their residential and/or faculty advisors and building managers, as well as to the HUHS Center for Wellness and Health Promotion.”
“Philosophical Musings
Whilst we earnestly work hard to keep wildlife wild (and out of our buildings), we invite you to ponder how others perceive mice. A few notable examples are provided for your viewing, listening and reading pleasure. Enjoy!

Sarah and I climb the steps to the top of Kirkland’s A entry with a pile of party invitations in hand. Our plan is to hit six houses, the Yard, and Cronkhite all in one go — not only to drop off the envelopes but to make a toast to each location. It’s a nondescript Tuesday in October, but for us, river run is happening now.
We didn’t intend to turn dispensing invitations into a river run, but somewhere in the planning process we realized neither of us had completed the time-honored freshman tradition of drinking at every river house to prevent getting quadded on Housing Day. For Sarah, it was because her first year was in 2020, the Covid year when freshmen were only allowed to spend the fall on campus. For me, it was because I transferred to Harvard as a sophomore.
What the hell, we both thought.
My version of Housing Day came in the form of an email sent in August of my sophomore year, which I spent entirely in New Jersey. While Harvard let freshmen onto campus, they decided they didn’t have room for the 15-person transfer cohort that was equally as new to the school. I wouldn’t live in my house, Winthrop, until halfway through college.
When I finally arrived at Harvard as a junior, I knew exactly five people on campus. Looking for community, I threw myself into clubs that stuck to varying degrees and got caught in endless cycles of “let’s get a meal” that never materialized into anything. At dinner, when peers would reminisce about the last time they experienced “real” Harvard, I stayed silent, wishing I could understand what they meant.
When Sarah and I drop off invitations at Winthrop, we stop for a drink in my suite. Sarah finds the twisting hallways confusing, so I lead us through them. I think about how junior year me would be comforted knowing I finally got the hang of the layout.
At Leverett, we find our friend Sebastian, who invites us into his suite and proudly displays his unobstructed view of the Charles River. Sarah and I shouldn’t stay long if we want to make it to all the houses, but hearing Sebastian explain his Halloween costume is worth it. “Eats, shoots, and leaves,” he explains with a giggle, showing us a panda onesie and a nerf gun. He has to repeat it a few times before I finally get the pun.
After climbing multiple stairwells looking for a single room in Russell Hall, Sarah and I decide that Adams is the worst house in not only all of the river, but all of Harvard. Its only redeeming quality is our friend Cindy, who welcomes us into her suite. Seeing her dorm room makes me double down on my opinion of the house.
I ask Sarah if she wants to stop by Lowell, Mather, and Dunster, the houses we have no invitations for. “Probably not,” she says.
Objectively, whether or not we complete a full river run does not matter. I already live in a river house, and so does she. The River Gods freshmen pray to through this strange ritual have no say in what House you get, anyways. But I’m still disappointed: it matters to me to replicate this tradition as closely as possible.
Ever since I got to Harvard, I’ve wanted to make my time as “normal” as possible to correct for the abnormality in my path to this institution. The week after I received my acceptance letter, I watched every “day in my life at Harvard” video on YouTube I could find, hoping to nail down the layout of campus through the backgrounds of their videos; I didn’t want to be the only person my age getting lost in the Yard. I thought about taking a gap semester to save myself from a sophomore spring of online school, but I didn’t want to graduate off-cycle. The kitchens in Winthrop’s overflow housing were tempting, but I wanted to live in a normal suite.
If I tried hard enough, I thought, I could get close enough to the “real thing.” And doing river run — in the “right” way — would be a step in that direction.
Of course, in many ways my experience here is normal. Thanks to the pandemic, no one in my year has had the college experience we were expecting. But when people used that fact to comfort me, it would frustrate me instead. My peers only had a semester and a half of an on-campus freshman year, but I had nothing. In the larger context of the pandemic, I knew my own woes were trivial. But that didn’t stop me from feeling this way.
My river run was not the real thing. We never made it to Lowell, Mather, or Dunster. There was no thrill of sneaking past security guards, knowing what you’re getting away with. There was no desperately texting any upperclassman you know for advice.
But what my river run did have was conversations with the network of friends I’ve made in the past two years. It had a friend who was willing to do something stupid and spontaneous with me. It came with a sense of familiarity that only builds with time. And when I realized that, I gave up on having the real thing.
At Eliot, our final house of the night, we share a drink with our friend Michael. One of his suitemates shows me his jazz record collection, and Michael and I laugh about our shared experience writing archaeology theses. Leaving Eliot, I don’t feel the need to trek to another house. I can simply go home.

Mary Elizabeth Johnson started college as an English major. As she began to think about a career path, she realized she wanted to be able to share her love of literature with young people.
“I think about the books that I read when I was, eight, nine, ten, and I still think about them. I think they really shaped who I am,” she says. “I could picture myself spending the rest of my life talking about it in schools with kids every day.”
Johnson is pursuing her Master’s in Education through the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Teaching and Teacher Leadership program. Started in October 2021, the TTL program is in many ways a remodeling of the Harvard Teacher Fellows program that ended the same month — though unlike HTF, it is open to applicants beyond Harvard College graduates.
One of five HGSE master’s tracks, TTL offers a Teaching Licensure Strand, which trains recent college graduates seeking teacher certification, and a Teacher Leadership Strand, designed for teaching professionals looking to transition to leadership roles. Within the licensure strand, students can pursue an internship model, where they work alongside a more experienced teacher, or a residency model, where they work alone as part-time teachers.
The program is distinct for its mixed pool of students; those in the licensure strand are mentored by others in the leadership strand. “One of the strengths of having these two groups together is that they can really feed on each other,” says HGSE professor Heather C. Hill, faculty co-chair of TTL. “The mix of experience and novice is really pretty awesome.”
Jenn O’Brien ’22, a current TTL student, says she received invaluable feedback from her mentor in the leadership strand while teaching in a summer school. “She just asked me questions about my goals as an educator, we set goals, and then she observed me and took really intentional notes on what I asked her and told her that I was working on,” O’Brien says.
TTL student Sylvia Zhang, who is currently working at a school in South Boston, says that the teacher she works with provides a critical source of mentorship outside of the mentors affiliated with TTL. “She would give me more practical advice and then help me to combine the knowledge I learned in class to apply that in real life to my students,” she says.
According to O’Brien, the strong sense of community among TTL’s cohort sets it apart from other licensure programs. “We just fell into really strong relationships really quickly because I think we all came to teaching for different but similar reasons and share some same values around what education means,” she says.
While Zhang and O’Brien participate in the internship model, Johnson chose the residency model, which she says provides a level of independence she wasn’t afforded while student-teaching as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan. “The way that they talked about the residency, where you are responsible for a classroom starting September 1, sounded very exciting to me,” she says.
For TTL student Tim George, the most valuable aspect of TTL’s courses is the opportunity to work on improvising lessons and presenting them for feedback to his peers. “I think it’s those times when we’re vulnerable in front of our peers, who are amazing people and capable and supportive, really trying to push ourselves to create a new type of lesson plan,” he says. “Having the ability to do that pretty much on a weekly basis, I think, is what the TTL program is.”
From the licensure strand to the extensive financial aid provided to students entering a notoriously underpaid profession, TTL preserves many aspects of HTF, which provided teaching licensure and experience with the option of a subsidized master’s degree to Harvard College graduates.
“In many respects, the Harvard Teacher Fellows program continues, but it now just expands,” says HGSE Dean Bridget Long. “There’s certainly a desire to make sure there’s a pathway for Harvard College students, but also to be welcoming to other students.”
pointing to TTL’s applicant pool being open to non-Harvard College students.
But the handover between the two programs attracted some criticism from students at the time, who worried that its abruptness and minimal advertising would result in fewer applicants.
HTF was not the only path to teaching for Harvard College students that ended last year. The University also canceled the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program, which allowed undergraduates to become certified teachers during their four-year degree, directing interested students toward TTL instead. At the time, some students criticized UTEP’s cancellation for removing a direct path for students interested in teaching, one of the few that existed at the undergraduate level.
While the Harvard Graduate School of Education is ranked one of the best in the nation, Harvard offers few opportunities to engage with education studies at the undergraduate level. Though the College has an Education Studies secondary field, founded in 2018, it has no education concentration. With the cancellation of HTF and UTEP, there is no direct pathway for students at the College to earn a teaching certification.
O’Brien, who pursued the Education Studies Secondary, says that studying education can feel difficult amid a student body that undervalues teaching as a profession. “I think it is kind of countercultural to be thinking about a career in public education,” she says.
Johnson struggles with the separation she feels from the rest of Harvard University as a TTL student at HGSE. “It doesn’t feel as cool sometimes. You know, it’s Harvard, but it’s like Harvard-lite.”
Despite this culture surrounding the teaching profession, George maintains the value of a career in education. “While [teaching] represents a small fraction of the chosen profession within their peer group, it is immensely rewarding,” he says. “I think it covers a lot of the bases of happiness and professional growth and making a big difference immediately after college.”

A loss of $11 billion — something that could only happen in a Monopoly game for (most of) us, but for Harvard, it was reality. When the 2008 recession hit, Harvard’s endowment dropped from $37 billion to $26 billion. With its strapped leftovers, it had to make some adjustments: The College took away hot breakfast in all upperclassmen dining hall. The world was beginning to crumble. Bad choices were made, but surely, there had to be good reasons … right?
Except then, in 2009, Harvard invested in perhaps the most unassumingly pretentious item it could think of: colorful lawn chairs spotted around the Yard. What we thought were $30 aluminum chairs from IKEA turned out to be designer chairs from the Fermob Luxembourg Collection going for $475 apiece. Students might have lost out on a warm breakfast, but we had bold-colored chairs imported from France that nobody asked for to fill the gaping holes in our hearts (and now, stomachs). Thirteen years later, these chairs would end up as room decor for many freshmen, but it does make us wonder … what could we have compromised that was less necessary for our physical and mental well-being?
Harvard’s payment to the MBTA to run their trains slower under Wigglesworth Hall
As the folklore goes, when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority wanted to extend the Red Line beyond the Harvard Square station, they tried to excavate a tunnel under the Yard. When Harvard objected, the MBTA took them to court. One executive order signed by George Washington later, Harvard won, saving the residents of Wigglesworth eight-minute intervals of earthquakes. The MBTA settled on building tracks to avoid the Yard, and some say that Harvard still pays the MBTA for their cooperation. For the dietary benefit of the entire university though, we feel like Wigg could’ve dealt with some noise … saving Harvard the hefty legal fees (and whatever they bribed George Washington with).
Children’s trains making laps in the dark around the Yard
Speaking of trains … Can we take a moment to reflect on the children’s electric train at Yardfest that people waited in line to squat in so they could parade around the Yard they walk in everyday? We must admit, the view must have been pretty crazy — the grass, trees at the corners of every patch of grass, lawn chairs spread out on the grass … have we mentioned the grass? Wild stuff.
Has anyone figured out Crimson Print?!
Harvard should have gotten rid of free printing and instead exploited its students by charging 12 cents a page to make up for its $11 billion in losses! Oh wait … it already did. We knew we hit a new low when we cried over trying to figure out Crimson Print (twice); we can’t afford to lose another cent after having lost so much to the washers and dryers.
Land. So. Much. Land. Since 2012, Harvard has spent over $100 million buying vineyards in California wine country. But since we have yet to see a Crimson Cabernet served with HUDS dinner, there’s really no need for Harvard to own all these grapes.
The century-old tortilla. If you want to pay a visit to an ancient chip, a 125-year-old tortilla is buried deep within the collections of the Harvard University Herbaria. Specifically, the tortilla hails from Mexico, was made from corn in 1897, and currently resides in the Economic Botany Herbarium of Oakes Ames — part of the Museum of Natural History.
Half of Bacow’s salary. In 2020, Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow earned $1.13 million. At Costco, a 10 pound bag of pancake mix costs $8.49. So unless Larry is buying 1,330,977 pounds of powdered buttermilk and flour each year, he doesn’t need that much money. And everybody needs hot breakfast, because, after all, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

Edward Winters isn’t afraid of challenging conversations. In fact, he invites them. One chilly September afternoon, Winters — a veganism and animal rights advocate known more widely as “Earthling Ed”— sat outside the Science Center with a microphone, beneath a banner that read, “Give me your best argument against veganism.” Two professional-grade cameras were filming the scene for his over 400,000 YouTube subscribers. For hours, dozens of students congregated around Winters, braving the biting wind to present their contentions. Winters sat patiently through each conversation, calmly rebutting each argument posed by students and explaining his logic.
Those not familiar with Winters’s style of activism may see him as just another YouTuber asking students questions on campus, but to a few freshmen, he’s also a teacher. As a Media and Design Fellow at the university, Winters helps teach Animals and Politics — one of the classes offered through Harvard’s first-year writing program — alongside Sparsha Saha. The two began collaborating in 2020, when Winters created a webinar for her class. Now, Winters leads six in-class workshops for Saha to support students with their capstone projects, and he hopes to use his own experience as an activist to encourage students to find their own voices.
Winters’s style of activism focuses on drawing people — whether his students, the people he debates, or his viewers at home — into what he hopes are reasonable, logical, and understanding discussions about veganism. “The conversation I always try and strike up with people is one of viewing animals as deserving moral consideration,” Winters says in an interview. His content, which ranges from debates on college campuses to video essays, emphasizes the care and sympathy for all creatures that is fundamental to his ideology.
Winters first became a vegetarian after reading a 2014 article about a chicken truck crashing near Manchester, England. He starts many of his talks by referencing this article, painting a picture of the 1,500 chickens littered across the road, some killed by passing cars, others surviving but just barely, their wings and bodies broken and contorted. The horror Winters felt recontextualized the way he viewed animal suffering. After learning more about animal exploitation within the dairy industry, Winters went fully vegan.
Since then, he’s made it his mission to teach those around him about veganism and animal rights. “There’s a good number of academics and intellectuals talking about these issues, but in terms of advocates and educators, engaging with consumers and people, I feel that there’s not enough conversation around the merits of [veganism],” says Winters.
Social media has made conversations about veganism more accessible and widespread, though the attention the movement has received online is not always positive. Some of the most vocal vegan influencers have been criticized for their antagonistic methods and tone-deaf rhetoric. One of the most controversial vegan influencers, Kadie K. Diekmeyer, better known as “That Vegan Teacher” on TikTok, has been denounced for her inflammatory rhetoric and her conflation of animal rights abuses with human rights abuses, like the Holocaust.
“We should be extra careful of how we come across online and how we come across to the everyday person,” says Winters, commenting on this sort of divisive activism. “The moment that we stop seeming reasonable or logical or even just understanding, I think, is the moment where we lose people and lose their interest in this issue.”
Rather than seeing arguments against veganism as something to attack, Winters tries to use these moments as learning opportunities. He says that the students who sit down to talk with him are usually open to new ways of thinking. “I think that veganism is logical, which is just based on what we know about the biology of animals, the sentience of animals, and then applying the moral values that we’ve already had in a consistent way,” he says.
He also believes that logic often resonates better than appeals to emotion. “I like logic because I think it makes people feel less like they’ve been guilted into something,” says Winters. “I don’t want people to feel like I’m forcing my views on them. I am hopefully trying to encourage them to recognize that the views they already have actually aligned with veganism already.”
In addition to his work at Harvard, Winters has various other active initiatives, both online and offline: a new book called “This Is Vegan Propaganda: (And Other Lies the Meat Industry Tells You),” a vegan diner, TED Talks, an animal sanctuary, and a sustainable clothing brand. These projects are all part of Winters’s multi-pronged approach to dismantling animal injustice, an issue he calls a “hydra,” an evil that needs to be attacked from multiple angles.
Winters asserts that veganism is not only a diet, but also a lifestyle and way of thinking.
“What I think is really powerful about veganism is that it challenges one of our most ingrained biases and ingrained prejudices,” Winters says. “It really opens your eyes to thinking, ‘Well, where else are we out of sync here?’”

We may know Sanders Theatre as a spotlight for Harvard’s musicians — but one peek behind the curtain reveals a lesser known, though equally crucial, musical talent. One out-of-tune piano hardly seems like an emergency. But as the technicians of Harvard’s Piano Shop know all too well, a slightly discordant harmony can make or break a Sanders success.
The Piano Technical Services is composed of a team of four people who work to maintain the 200-plus pianos on campus. In addition to tuning the instruments, they also prepare pianos for concerts, maintain the campus’s harpsichords, and restore vintage pianos.
Piano technician and extended techniques specialist Richard A. Gruenler explains there isn’t really a rhythm to the daily work of a piano tech. “It's really hard to say what day to day is,” he says. “It's more like what month to month is.” At the start of each semester, the technicians tune all of the pianos on campus. In the summer, they focus on rebuilding worn-out pianos and conducting extensive repairs.
Fixing a damaged instrument or tuning a faulty piano is hardly a glamorous process — especially compared to the excitement of a piano concerto. But the intense labor and precision of the technicians’ work is what enables the musical magic we hear onstage.
When we speak to technician Austin L. Grimes, he’s twisting the pins in the diaphragm of the piano in Eliot Dining Hall with a piano tuner key. He looks through the windows and plays the note, observing the change in pitch, before twisting the key again. Amid the buzz of students talking and eating, Grimes tunes out the noise to make sure each of the 88 keys sounds perfect.
There are a variety of ways pianos, especially those that are over 100 years old, can be damaged and require repairs. “The keys can get worn and they need to be refurbished,” Grimes explains. “Sometimes the felt inside the piano can get attacked by moths and damaged that way. Other times, they can just get worn out from use for years and years and years.”
After packing his tools, wiping dust off the piano, and closing the lid, Grimes recalls his introduction to tuning, when his own experience as a musician turned into a need for technical understanding. “I saved my money for an upright piano. And then I quickly came to realize that it was out of tune a lot of the time.” So Grimes bought a tuning key — and quickly realized that turning a piano takes incredible skill and dexterity.
In addition to tuning, Gruenler specializes in approving all of the requests for “extended techniques,” or instances where pianists want to use the instrument unconventionally. One example of this, Gruenler says, is when “people will put screws in the strings between strings and give it a more percussive sound.” Some technicians frown upon these techniques, citing concerns of damage to the piano as a result of tampering with its innards. But Gruenler emphasizes that he values the independence of the artist and their freedom to explore different sounds — “as long as you're not going to destroy it.”
It is perhaps no surprise that all four of Harvard’s piano technicians come from a musical background themselves; their lives are deeply steeped in music. Grimes says, “I think it’s something that's sort of woven into not only this professional life that I have here, but the other aspects of my life — it’s with me playing the piano and listening to music and going to concerts and helping people who play piano.”
Piano playing and piano tuning, it would seem, operate symbiotically, with one skill reinforcing, even reaffirming, the other. For Gruenler, who comes from a background in composition, being a technician makes him a better musician. He says, “it always sticks with you, like you hear something. You hear it in a way that most people don't hear.”
September 23, 8 p.m.: That’s when we hear it.
It’s among the first chilly days of fall — the sweaters we lugged to Cambridge weeks ago are ready to be used. A sense of summer’s conclusion lingers in the brisk air.
Suddenly, inside our Cabot House bedrooms on either side of the Radcliffe Quadrangle’s lawn, a hissing, clanking noise kicks in.
Twenty feet below Pforzheimer House, a fire dashes violently through the center of a menacing, truck-sized heap of metal and pipes known as a Kewanee Classic III Scotch Boiler, a trusty, decades-old machine. The boiler pumps out steam, which races down hallways, slithers under floorboards, and weaves through bedrooms, where it reaches our radiators. There, it heats the metal up before condensing into water and rushing back toward the boiler.
The boiler room tucked below Pfoho’s Moors Hall is but a small part of the behemoth energy operation that makes life at the University possible.
All told, Harvard owns and operates two power plants: the new Allston District Energy Facility, a key part of the University’s expansion in the area, and the Blackstone Steam Plant, which heats roughly 80 percent of campus and co-generates electricity. Harvard also operates its own electric microgrid, with a capacity and peak energy demand enough to power about 40,000 homes.
But for students like us, this vital operation of heating and cooling our campus, including the workers that run it, is often hidden from view: in basement boiler rooms, power plants, and the mythic network of tunnels.
We set out to uncover and understand the system that keeps Harvard running — from heating and cooling to electricity. From tours of the infrastructure, conversations with facilities workers and administrators, and many, many emails, a portrait of a deeply complex system emerged — one at once modern and old-fashioned. It’s also a system that will have to change if the University is to meet its ambitious climate goals: fossil fuel neutral by 2026, and fossil fuel-free by 2050.
Though Harvard has decreased greenhouse gas emissions by about 29 percent over the last 16 years, its carbon footprint remains gargantuan: the University emitted the equivalent of 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2021, according to data released by the Office of Sustainability — roughly 14,000 times the average American’s annual carbon footprint.
The University faces a steep challenge, because reaching its goals depends not only on increasing energy efficiency and remaking campus infrastructure, but also on the makeup of the larger Massachusetts grid, which does not share its fossil fuel-free goal.
As the 1.7 trillion tons of carbon dioxide emissions sitting in the atmosphere — more than a quarter of them from the United States — dramatically, painfully remake our world, Harvard’s institutional position as a global leader on climate change, both in decarbonization goals as well as its research and education, will only become more important.
As climate change accelerates, the University must grapple with difficult questions: Are the administration’s ambitious climate goals the right way for Harvard to lead? And is it even within the University’s control to meet them?
The first place we look for answers to these questions is the basement of Pfoho.
On a crisp September afternoon, we follow John P. Sabbio, a maintenance operator for the University’s Campus Services, down a narrow corridor under Moors Hall.
Ducking under a low ceiling, Sabbio leads us down a rickety metal staircase. At the bottom, the rough concrete walls give way to a hot labyrinth of rusty metal and dirty concrete. Pipes intersect, twist, and snake in and out of view; brightly colored “danger,” “warning,” and “caution” signs stick out. At the core of the maze are three boilers, each about 12 feet tall.
In a gruff, Boston accent, Sabbio explains how the boiler system works, going through each component in quick succession.
What looks to us like an incomprehensible maze is second nature to Sabbio, who has been an employee of the University for 37 years. Sabbio began his career in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning as a Machinist’s Mate on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.
Only one boiler is in use on this day. Another is undergoing its annual inspection and retooling, so we can look inside — it’s studded with cylindrical holes about two inches across, which fill with water that’s converted into steam, Sabbio tells us.
He points us to the glass end of a thin metal tube that sticks out from the center heating cylinder, through which we can see the single fire that ultimately provides heat to the Quad. He explains that the fire only turns on periodically, when the pressure within the pipes drops and the temperature of the steam falls below 212 degrees.
Sabbio counts down. “Fifteen seconds,” he says. We wait. “Three, two, one, right now!” A series of bright yellow and red hues spurt into view. The steam and pressure within the pipes rise, and after a while, the fire kicks back off.
Standing beside the noisy boiler, he explains his role. “I babysit it, I watch it, I’m the keeper.” In a system as high-pressure as this, though, babysitting is often a dangerous task, as a burn mark on his right hand attests.
Under Sabbio’s careful watch, the boiler — and, during the wintertime, sometimes multiple boilers — produces the steam that heats all the buildings in the Quad and powers the HUDS kitchens that serve Pfoho, Cabot, and Currier.
To make sure this essential system runs smoothly, the boilers are monitored in a control center, by a group in the Energy and Facilities Department that Sabbio calls “the brains of the whole place.” If something goes wrong — a busted pipe, or an offline boiler — they call someone like Sabbio to fix the problem.
Although Sabbio’s job is most demanding during the winter, it’s his favorite time of year to be in the boiler room. “On a zero degree day I come down here first because it’s always so hot,” Sabbio says. “You know, when it’s snowing out, it’s awesome. In the summertime, when it’s hot, it’s miserable.”
Sabbio enjoys his job, and recognizes its importance. “I just like heating, you know. I’m an HVAC mechanic,” he says. “I don’t do a lot of cooling. I do a lot of heating.”
Thanks to this system, Quad residents get heat and hot food every day. The Quad’s heating system is separate from the rest of the University, though, a relic from when the buildings still constituted Radcliffe College. To understand what heats the rest of campus, we need to go to the river.
Walk down Memorial Drive to Western Avenue and you’ll find the beating heart of Harvard’s heating system: the Blackstone Steam Plant.
On the day we go to Blackstone, it’s covered in scaffolding for ongoing repairs, but squinting through the black mesh, we can see its red brick and tall, arched windows that span several stories. Two silver towers protrude from the roof.
Harvard has owned Blackstone since 2002, when it acquired the plant from NSTAR utility company for $14.6 million, but the facility has produced steam for Harvard since 1930.
Today, Blackstone provides heat to more than 165 buildings on campus, and also co-generates enough electricity to fulfill roughly a third of Harvard’s electricity demand. The rest of Harvard’s electricity needs are met by a combination of on-campus solar panels, wind power purchases, and the regional grid.
From the outside, Blackstone appears sleepy and peaceful. But inside, it’s home to four natural-gas boilers, a turbine, and a machine that produces heat and power concurrently, surrounded by a maze of silver pipes, chains, and beams.
Unlike the Quad’s system, Blackstone’s boilers bring the steam to much higher pressure – 400 pounds per square inch – meaning that the temperature of the steam is also higher – 450 degrees.
The plant then cools down the piping hot steam — a process it harnesses to produce additional electricity. The steam rushes through a turbine, turning fans that then capture that energy as electricity, spitting out up to 5 megawatts, enough to simultaneously charge 1 million phones.
More electricity is also generated in Blackstone through a unit that creates heat and power at the same time, generating up to 7.5 megawatts of electricity — another 1.5 million phones.
The newly-cooled steam then exits Blackstone and enters a network of tunnels. The tunnels are a source of legend at Harvard, inspiring countless stories. A Nazi spy escaped an FBI agent through them, one story goes. Alabama governor George C. Wallace, fleeing protestors for his pro-segregation views in 1968, escaped through them, goes another. Nowadays, whispers of secret late-night rendezvous spread through campus.
Though these legends are most of what students hear about the steam tunnels, they also serve a vital function. Built in the early 20th century as Harvard transitioned from having individual boilers for each building to using Blackstone as a centralized hub, today they facilitate the distribution of heat and hot water across Harvard’s campus.
They heat the Yard, River Houses, Kennedy School, Divinity School, Law School, and lab buildings. They even provide heat to some of Harvard’s Allston campus, bringing steam to the Business School through a tunnel embedded in the hollow Weeks Bridge, so narrow that the rare maintenance worker making the crossing sometimes has to stoop or crawl.
The steam might end up warming a sleeping first year in their Wigglesworth dorm, a mouse in the Biolabs, or a Business School student partying with their friends.
As the only supplier of heat to most of Harvard’s campus, Blackstone is vital for the University’s daily functioning — and the reason we don’t freeze during Boston’s bitterly cold winters. In case of power outages or natural disasters, the University has standby units that are maintained at all times.
Once winter turns to summer, though, the challenge shifts from heating to cooling. Harvard’s chilled water system, which consists of a 13,000-ton plant in the Science Center and a 7,500-ton plant in the Northwest Building, cools 75 buildings across campus. As the chilled water runs through the building, warm air is blown past it and cools down in the process, before reentering the room and cooling it down in turn.
Machinery in the Science Center basement pumps the water up to three towers that protrude from the roof. The Northwest Building also produces some chilled water. Together, the facilities provide cooling power equivalent to installing 6,800 residential air conditioners.
The energy Blackstone produces flows into Harvard’s own microgrid, a complex network of miles of wires and cables that supplies power to over 250 of the school’s buildings. At peak demand, the system uses 40 megawatts, enough to supply 40,000 homes with electricity.
This energy demand does not come equally from all buildings on campus. Labs, despite only making up 22 percent of campus, consume 46 percent of Harvard’s energy due to the energy-intensive devices they include. Residential spaces, by contrast, use 16 percent of Harvard’s energy despite making up 31 percent of its land area.
Since Harvard owns its microgrid, it can control which sources provide the electricity that flows through it.
Blackstone produces up to 12 megawatts. Rooftop solar panels, installed across 31 locations, can provide up to 3 megawatts, depending on the weather. Harvard also buys around 13 megawatts of wind power from the Stetson Wind Il facility, which does not go to powering campus, but rather to offsetting its emissions. What isn’t provided by these sources is taken from the regional grid — which stretches from New York to the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
Though some of Harvard’s electricity comes from renewable sources, it is still reliant on fossil fuels. Last year, Blackstone used 13 million therms of natural gas, 330,000 gallons of fuel oil, and 40,000 gallons of waste vegetable oil.
In the regional grid, 10 percent comes from renewable energy, 3 percent from nuclear, and 6 percent from hydro power. As for the rest, 46 percent comes from fossil fuels, while 16 percent is imported, making its breakdown unclear
Harvard’s partial reliance on the fossil fuel-dependent regional grid for electricity — one that might grow should Harvard stop burning fossil fuels to generate power and rely more on electricity — points to the fundamental issues of making a fossil-fuel-free promise in a deeply interlinked energy system.
On an October afternoon in 2008, thousands packed into Tercentenary Theatre — under banners promising that “Green is the New Crimson” — to hear an address from former Vice President Al Gore ’69, a vocal climate activist.
Then-University President Drew G. Faust introduced him: “How we light our classrooms, how we heat our water, how we build and ventilate our laboratories all send powerful signals,” she said.
Gore took the stage. “We have to do something unprecedented in favor of the survival of human civilization,” he said to the cheering crowd.
Criticizing the world’s “absurd overdependence on carbon-based fuels,” Gore emphasized the role higher education could play in combating the climate crisis.
“If we are to accept that goal, we must find ways to make better use of the knowledge produced in universities,” he said, “and supply their best and most recent conclusions as a basis for decision making.”
Gore’s speech capped off a month-long sustainability celebration University-wide, with events that included panels, film screenings, and discussions, and emphasized Harvard’s environmental focus.
As part of the event, Faust officially launched the Office for Sustainability, an expanded version of the former Green Campus Initiative. Its primary task would be implementing the sustainability plan Faust had unveiled that summer — with its ambitious goal of reducing campus emissions 30 percent from a 2006 baseline by 2016.
“We at Harvard must be a model as we demonstrate our commitment to the future,” said Faust at the event. “Every person at Harvard — student, faculty, staff — can contribute to the effort to avert the dire outcomes that scientists are predicting.”
“Green is the New Crimson” — at once a rallying cry and promise — seemed to reach and unify every corner of campus life. Students and professors worked with dining hall staff to create sustainable meals. William James Hall and the Hoffman Labs won “green medals” in a five month-long contest among thirteen FAS buildings to reduce energy usage. (According to a Harvard Gazette article at the time: “The real winner, though: Earth itself.”) And the University administration kicked into gear, working towards a goal it ultimately achieved.
In 2016, Harvard had met its 30 percent goal, with its “absolute” emissions down by 24 percent. Electricity purchases from local renewable sources made up the other 6 percent.
Simply switching to less carbon-intensive fossil fuels — and largely continuing to run systems uninterrupted — accounted for nearly half of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Burning natural gas releases half as much carbon dioxide as coal, and about 30 percent less than oil per unit of energy produced.
Blackstone’s switch to natural gas from oil accounted for 33 percent of the reduction, while another 16 percent came from the regional electric grid’s increased use of natural gas. About a quarter of the reduction came from energy efficiency measures — specifically, those made possible by a $12 million fund through which Energy and Facilities upgraded existing heating, cooling, and lighting systems.
But the coalition that had been so united during the 2008 sustainability celebration didn’t hold together for long.
In 2012, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard was formed, setting off a tense relationship between student climate activists and administration officials. From a referendum that advocated for divestment from fossil fuels — which earned approval from the undergraduates who voted — to protests and petitions, this new fractured reality came into focus.
In April of 2015, FFDH held “Harvard Heat Week,” a weeklong series of protests and organizing efforts. It culminated in a blockage of Massachusetts Hall, which, in part, focused on blocking President Faust from entering the administrative building.
“The time for dialogue has passed. The time for action is now,” said Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 at a teach-in.
Faust was not sympathetic to activist demands, and her rebuke of the Massachusetts Hall blockade was sharp: it “signaled a movement away from the principles of exchange and legitimate free expression,” she told The Crimson at the time.
In September 2021, following nearly a decade of pressure from campus activists, the University announced it would allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire, paving the way for its endowment to eventually divest its holdings from the sector.
In a message to Harvard affiliates announcing the move, Bacow wrote that fossil fuel investments have become imprudent “given the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long-term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission.” But he has stopped short of using the word “divestment,” and the University has not provided a timeline for the liquidation.
Harvard has also separately pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its endowment portfolio by 2050.
In February 2018, Faust set a new, longer-term climate goal: achieving fossil fuel neutrality by 2026, and going fossil fuel-free by 2050. Unlike the 30 percent emissions reduction goal, Harvard’s new goal is much more far-reaching, and means that by 2050, it will have to buy all of its electricity from renewable sources. It also means that the District Energy Facility and University vehicles will need to operate without fossil fuels.
In an emailed statement, Heather A. Henriksen, Harvard’s chief sustainability officer, outlined “four key components” the University must address to deliver on its 2026 and 2050 fossil-fuel promises: “District Energy Systems, its standalone buildings, its purchased energy supply, and its fleet vehicles.”
“To achieve these ambitious goals, all of Harvard’s district energy systems and buildings must be heated, cooled, and powered without the use of fossil fuels, all University vehicles must be 100% electric, and all of Harvard’s purchased electricity must come from renewable sources,” she wrote.
As for just how exactly Harvard plans to decarbonize its power plant — or ensure the Massachusetts grid is clean— the University remains tight-lipped, and a clear path forward remains muddy.
Henriksen was not made available for an interview for this story.
The main administrative unit that oversees Harvard’s current sustainability efforts is the Office for Sustainability. On its website, it lists four goals: teaching and empowering students, implementing research findings on campus, institutionalizing best practices, and spreading them throughout the school and outside of Harvard. It considers Harvard a “living lab,” as it tries to implement different sustainable practices and see what effect they have.
From day to day, the office is responsible for developing sustainability-focused campaigns and initiatives, and providing expertise to Harvard’s schools about their sustainability efforts.
For instance, as part of its pledge to reach zero vehicle emissions, the Sustainability Office helped initiate Harvard’s purchase of four electric shuttles in 2021, and began setting up infrastructure for them to charge.
Another example is the office’s “Green Labs” initiative, which provides strategies and programs to help labs conserve energy and resources. Its Shut the Sash Program, for instance, encourages labs to keep fume hoods, which are energy intensive, closed when they’re not in use. Pizza parties are raffled off to labs that reach their conservation goals, and wine and cheese celebrations are hosted twice a year for labs that consistently meet their goals.
But how will these smaller-scale efforts stack up in the long-term?
It’s a bright afternoon when we take the shuttle across the bridge into Allston. As a soccer field emerges on the right, space opens up, and the Science and Engineering Complex comes into view, a shining monolith with glimmering fish scales which reflect the sun.
But the building’s $1 billion futuristic design is not just an aesthetic choice; it also reflects how Harvard is thinking about preparing for long-term climate impacts.
The fish-scale exterior is designed to reduce the amount of energy needed to power the 544,000-square-foot facility. The angle of the scales in relation to the sun are designed to let light into the building in the winter, warming it, and reflect it during summer, cooling it. Because of these and other innovations, the SEC is LEED Platinum-certified, the highest possible distinction for the prestigious green building certification.
In the basement, giant cisterns are prepared to collect stormwater in the event of catastrophic flooding. Bioswales and retention basins capture rainwater and funnel it into a 78,000-gallon tank to be reused. The complex’s mechanical and electric infrastructure is located above flood levels, insurance against potential catastrophic events.
And the SEC is just one piece of Harvard’s planned expansion into Allston — it’s currently in the midst of building its Enterprise Research Campus, a mixed-use space intended to house everything from labs to retail to residential areas.
To support this expansion, Harvard is building an entirely new energy system, the District Energy Facility. Sitting several hundred feet from the SEC, the DEF promises to provide Harvard’s new Allston campus with the trifecta — heating, cooling, and electricity — but in a much more energy-efficient way.
Outside the glass, exposed to the elements, is a large, 1.3-million-gallon metal tank wrapped in a spiral staircase. It houses chilled water, which is produced when electricity is cheaper and less energy intensive — normally nights and weekends. Heating and electricity are created together in the new plant, and also involve a new, greener system: As the chilled water is produced, the residual heat is used to make heated water and produce electricity. Water is also heated by capturing waste heat from equipment and exhaust.
Though this new heating system is much more energy efficient, it is still powered by natural gas. But according to the Office for Sustainability’s website, the DEF’s “flexible” design will allow it to incorporate lower- or zero-carbon options as technology develops.
Making a real impact on climate change could not be more urgent, especially in the Boston area. The city is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise, with the World Bank ranking Boston as the eighth most vulnerable city globally in 2013. This sea level rise will impact Harvard, which is located right on the banks of the Charles — some experts have even suggested raising some Harvard buildings, like Widener and the River Houses, on stilts.
But as climate change turns up the pressure, it remains unclear exactly how Harvard can reach its goals. The general formula exists: decrease energy demand by increasing energy efficiency, build infrastructure that can run on renewables, and then clean up the energy supply. But the actual steps for executions are anything but clear, and are not laid out explicitly in any of Harvard’s publicly-available documents.
Harvard also faces an essential limitation: Because it uses energy from the regional grid, even if Harvard’s own infrastructure is ultra energy efficient, if the regional grid runs on fossil fuels, it will be difficult to reach its 2050 goal.
Several hurdles exist to decarbonizing the grid. The first is technological — does the needed technology exist, and can it be reasonably implemented?
According to James H. Stock, Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability, it varies by problem. “To a considerable extent, the technologies we need for electricity are present, with the final 10 percent being not quite clear,” says Stock in an interview. For heating, though, Stock says that more technologies need to be developed.
The existence of the technology is not the only consideration, though — price also matters. Many technologies “don’t really exist at a cost point that is at all reasonable,” Stock says, mentioning that despite Harvard’s $50.9 billion endowment, “everybody's got a budget.”
Ultimately, Stock says cleaning up the grid is not just a question of technology, but a “social project for the entire United States.”
Stock hopes that this will happen soon. “If a national grid becomes fossil fuel free by 2050, we failed — that’s way too late,” he says. “We need to make the grid decarbonize much sooner than that. Harvard will piggyback on that.”
Nevertheless, Stock is “quite confident” that Harvard will reach its 2050 goal, and may even get there before then. “A lot of that depends on how these technologies mature and what is possible,” Stock says, mentioning that many Harvard laboratories are doing research into vital topics that will enable the energy transition right now.
Though Harvard is ultimately just one actor, Stock still hopes it can play an important role in realizing the national decarbonization goal. “It’s a project for the entire country, and we're a microcosm of that,” Stock says. “It’d be great to see Harvard taking the lead. And I expect that we will.”
Whether or not Harvard achieves its goal, Daniel P. Schrag, Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering and Director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, believes that the University’s own net-zero focus — however well intentioned — fails to address what matters most: global cumulative emissions of greenhouse gasses.
“Should Harvard behave responsibly in terms of its own emissions? Sure, absolutely,” Schrag says. “But I think, frankly, the sustainability effort at Harvard has been too much at the center of the discussion on what Harvard should do.”
Schrag called institutions of all stripes to consider how they might help the world get to net-zero, rather than just themselves.
Where Harvard can ultimately be most influential, Schrag says, is in its educational mission. He called the influence of the University’s combined student body “the big lever that we have.”
“I'd like to see every student at Harvard really be able to think critically about climate change and how to manage it in the future,” he said.
Ian J. Miller, a history professor and the Faculty Dean of Cabot House, echoes Schrag’s sentiment about the importance of Harvard’s educational mission, emphasizing that climate change is a relevant issue across many fields.
“What I find is especially encouraging in the ways that the FAS leadership and the university leadership have defined the problem is that it is clearly understood accurately, as a problem that exceeds any one school or discipline,” Miller says. He adds that climate change is not just something for scientists to address but also economists, public health officials, doctors, and people at the divinity school.
Harvard has “begun to think really creatively, and with appropriate ambition, about how to knit those various factors together, while continuing to sustain the kind of disciplinary excellence that has set Harvard apart in any field,” Miller says.
Stock’s role as the Vice Provost is an important piece in realizing Harvard’s climate education mission. He describes the urgency of his job as twofold: helping faculty “really engage in coming up with practical solutions for these climate problems” and also to educate students. “We need to make sure that we train you properly,” Stock says.
Even if we stopped emitting carbon dioxide now, our climate would continue to change as a result of the carbon dioxide that has already been put into the atmosphere — transformations that will play out over the next hundreds of years.
“We've set in motion something that has very long time scales,” Schrag says. “The reality is that we are going to continue to feel increased impacts of climate change around the world for the next many decades, at least.”
Back at Cabot, it’s easy to forget about energy, infrastructure, and climate change. We return to our dorms after long days, think about our essays and problem sets, fold our laundry, and talk to our friends. Meanwhile, the same boilers run below Pfoho, keeping our rooms at a stable, comfortable temperature.
When we first started reporting this article, the first person we visited was Mike G. Russell, Cabot’s building manager. Despite his dizzying number of responsibilities — he oversees the custodial staff, keys, swipe access, mail, packages, security, and maintains all of the House spaces — he greeted us with a smile, and welcomed us into his office.
We asked him: what is Cabot doing to be more sustainable?
He told us that Cabot is installing LEDs to replace fluorescent bulbs and switching over to more efficient hot water boilers. Larger changes will come, though, when renovations happen. “We're going to do what we can until we end up getting renewed here at Cabot,” he said.
When that happens, all of Cabot’s buildings will be gutted and then built back up with better insulation and more energy efficient systems, like the other houses that have already been renovated.
For the last four or five years, Sabbio says that he’s been “walking around with a bunch of engineers” trying to calculate and understand “what it would take to rip out those three boilers that were down in that mechanical room I took you to in Moors and replace them with some energy efficient, gas-fired, 90-percent efficient boilers.” That boiler would still run on fossil fuels.
Though change is coming to Cabot and Harvard, it’s hard to imagine what it will be like in 10 years — let alone 50 or 100. What new heating systems will be put in place? Will Harvard hit net zero? If they don’t, will it even matter?
Despite this uncertainty, every day behind the scenes, engineers, facility maintenance operators, building managers and office workers are working and making the decisions about Harvard’s energy infrastructure and role in the climate crisis – decisions that may ultimately create the future we live in.
As Russell puts it: “Nothing happens around here without thinking of energy.”

William S. Consovoy, the prominent conservative attorney who has led the crusade against Harvard’s race conscious admissions policies on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions, will not argue before the Supreme Court on Oct. 31.
Consovoy was diagnosed with brain cancer two years ago and will step back from the SFFA case this month to receive treatment, according to CNN.
Consovoy, who has represented the anti-affirmative action group since it first sued Harvard in 2014, will be replaced at the Supreme Court by attorney Cameron T. Norris, a partner at Consovoy’s legal firm, Consovoy McCarthy, according to CNN.
In a statement, SFFA President Edward J. Blum said the group “is saddened that Mr. Consovoy will not be able to represent our students at the oral arguments at the Supreme Court.”
“He has been a source of energy, wisdom and knowledge for this litigation and we wish him a speedy recovery,” Blum wrote.
Students for Fair Admissions first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging the university discriminates against Asian American applicants through its race-conscious admissions processes. Following two court rulings in favor of the University, the group appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in January.
SFFA filed a similar lawsuit against the University of North Carolina in 2014 in a case also led by Consovoy’s firm. The Supreme Court combined the cases in January before separating them in July. Another Consovoy McCarthy partner, Patrick Strawbridge, will argue on behalf of SFFA in that case, according to CNN.
Consovoy has a long record of working for right-leaning causes: a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, he previously worked with Ed Blum to represent an Alabama county accused of violating the Voting Rights Act. Consovoy successfully convinced the Supreme Court to overturn portions of the law.
He has also served as a private attorney for former President Donald J. Trump, helping him fend off efforts to compel the release of his tax returns.
At oral argument on Oct. 31, Harvard will be represented by Seth P. Waxman ’73, a former United States Solicitor General. UNC will be represented by North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Y. Park.

Nine Harvard researchers are set to receive a total of more than $200 million in grants over the next five years through a National Institutes of Health program that funds “high-risk, high-reward” research.
The researchers — Adam Granger, Rachel Buckley, Benjamin P. Kleinstiver, Kara McKinley, Ellis Monk, Carlos Ponce, Silvi Rouskin, Dabattama Rai Sen and Bo Xia — are among 103 scientists who were selected by the program nationwide.
The grants fund “exceptionally creative scientists pursuing highly innovative research with the potential for broad impact in biomedical, behavioral, or social sciences,” according to the NIH’s website.
The NIH grant program distributes four different categories of awards — the Pioneer Award, the Transformative Research Award, the Early Independence Award, and the New Innovator Awards.
The Harvard researchers selected to receive the money study a diverse range of disciplines, ranging from sociology to stem cells and neuroscience.
Five of the recipients — Kleinstiver, Ponce, Buckley, Rouskin, and Sen — serve on the Harvard Medical School faculty.
Kleinstiver, an assistant professor at HMS, works on genome-editing technology, including CRISPR, and the development of new gene-editing tools.
“The specific focus of the grant itself was to find a way to scalably engineer CRISPR Cas enzymes,” he said.
Ponce, an assistant professor in HMS’s Department of Neurobiology, studies visual neuroscience, using machine learning to visually represent the primate brain. He said he plans to use the grant funding to obtain new technologies, such as better-functioning electrodes, optogenetics, and high-density probes.
Buckley, an assistant professor of neurobiology at HMS, researches preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. She plans to use the funding for a project that seeks to discover why women are two-thirds more likely to have dementia than men.
Her research suggests that sex differences could come from the tau protein, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and is produced in higher quantities in individuals who experience menopause earlier. She plans to focus her research on the structure and function of the X chromosome.
“Right now, we focus a lot on hormones, and we focus a lot on menopause, and I think part of that is to do with how easily we can measure some of these things,” Buckley said. “But looking at the chromosome is really hard. If we can find a way to do this and do it well in life, I think that could be really impactful.”
Rouskin, an assistant professor at HMS, studies RNA structure in gene regulation and disease. Sen, a faculty member at HMS, studies immune dysfunction in viral infections and tumors.
McKinley, an assistant professor at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, examines the regenerative capabilities of the uterus, which gets destroyed and rebuilt in approximately monthly cycles during menstruation.
“Historically, women’s health has been under-resourced — specifically women’s health that doesn’t pertain to pregnancy,” McKinley said. “I’ve been really excited to see that they are willing to invest in this kind of work.”
McKinley hopes to establish a population of African Spiny Mice — one of the few organisms that can menstruate — in order to design and run experiments to gain insights into diseases such as cancers and endometriosis.
Monk, a professor in the Sociology Department who studies race and ethnicity in the United States, was the lone social science faculty member who received funding through the program.
He plans to examine how social differences contribute to health disparities by creating a nationwide longitudinal survey. He also plans to work with clinicians to uncover why pulse oximeters are less accurate for patients with darker skin.
Xia and Granger both conduct research at the Broad Institute, a collaboration between Harvard and MIT that specializes in biomedical research.
Xia — a principal investigator at the Broad Institute who studies how genome organization affects development, disease, and evolution — said the grant is a “career-turning point” that will allow him to continue exploring the molecular side of primitive human and ape evolution.
Granger, a principal investigator at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute, focuses on changes that happen in the connectivity between different types of neurons in the brain in psychiatric disorders. His research uses viral infection tools, with a specific focus on rabies, to measure gene expression and map neuronal connections.
Granger said the NIH grant money will enable him to hire more people and take more risks in his research.
“Because this is a high-risk, high-reward grant mechanism, I can sort of shoot for the stars there and give it a shot and really work for something that’s more transformative — even if the chance of success is really low,” Granger said.

Tsitsi Dangarembga, a Radcliffe Institute Joy Foundation Fellow, discussed current crises facing Zimbabweans and their roots in colonialism in Southern Africa at a virtual event hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Wednesday.
The presentation, titled “Migration: The Path of the People,” included stories of civil rights violations in Zimbabwe, in which state officials arrested and tortured political opponents to silence dissent. Dangarembga —a novelist, playwright, and filmmaker — argued that these issues were modern consequences of the history of colonialism in Southern Africa.
Danarembga kicked off her talk by asking who the perpetrators of the current atrocities in Zimbabwe are.
“What kind of people perpetrate such atrocities? Where did they come from and what are their etiology? Why do they behave the way they do?” Danarembga asked.
Danarembga described the origins of the Zimbabweans as beginning in 7500 B.C., when West African people were believed to have migrated to Southern Africa. There, they established wealthy, strong states that engaged in trade and coexisted with surrounding societies.
Their encounters with the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, as well as other Europeans, resulted in frontier wars over territory and trade, she said.
Dangarembga highlighted the Seventh Frontier War, a conflict between the Xhosa Kingdom and the British Empire, as particularly significant in the migrants’ history.
“It is significant because it was the first time that Xhosa women — the migrant people who had settled in the Western Cape — tortured, captured British soldiers, even unto death,” she said. “My interpretation is that this shows a change in the ethical nature of the migrants, as well as physical migration.”
In the first half of the 19th century, the migrants were forced to travel back to West Africa by the British, she said.
Dangarembga described the migrations as “aggressive” and “bloodthirsty” and involved the unprecedented use of weapons.
“In my opinion, this strengthens my hypothesis that something fundamental had changed in the nature of the migrants over the course of the centuries and millennia,” she said.
Dangarembga cited Ubuntu, a philosophy of life that existed prior to European colonization of Southern Africa, as a commonality among many African cultures. Ubuntu defines individual identities through “socially acceptable ways they can interact” with one another.
Dangarembga said this way of life was disrupted by European colonization, resulting in a lasting legacy of social unrest.
“My hunch that I will investigate while I am here is that colonization disrupted these bonds without providing an alternative structure of psychosocial bonding, in which human desires could be satisfied positively in Zimbabwe,” Dangarembga said. “This led to the armed struggle of 1966 to 1979 and the atrocities that have been endemic in the society ever since.”
When asked about the presence of Ubuntu in current Zimbabwean society, Dangarembga said she believes it remains a potential solution to the atrocities.
“I think Ubuntu as a practice has been lost. I think Ubuntu as an idea, as a possibility, as potential, is still with us,” she said. “I think it can form these other paradigms that many philosophers are proposing and debating into something that can be useful.”
Days before the virtual event, Dangarembga filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence in Zimbabwe for protesting.
As a Radcliffe Institute Joy Foundation Fellow, Dangarembga plans to continue exploring the evolution of the Zimbabwean people.
“My project is to contribute to unraveling how the migrants who over millennia expanded, for the most part, peacefully from West Africa turn into the sort of people who normalize the kinds of acts that I related in the beginning,” she said.

Harvard freshmen usually look forward to eating and socializing in the College’s grand Annenberg Hall, which features a decorative vaulted ceiling supported by detailed wooden trusses.
But the members of the class of 2026 have yet to see Annenberg’s famed interior in its full glory.
Memorial Hall, the complex that includes Annenberg Hall and Sanders Theatre, has been under renovation since 2020. Now in the last phase of the project, Harvard is replacing the 148-year-old slate and copper roof above Annenberg, marking the first major renovation to the hall since 1995.
The first phase of renovations involved the replacement of the roof and rain leaders over Sanders Theatre. In the second phase, the University replaced the roof over Memorial Transept, the hall connecting Sanders to Annenberg. The transept’s masonry and window trimmings were also refurbished.
Since the final phase began this summer, white tarp has obscured Annenberg’s vaulted ceiling, and a skeleton of metal scaffolding has surrounded the hall’s exterior. Until earlier this month, students had to navigate through a wood panel tunnel to exit the dining hall.
Memorial Hall Complex Director Raymond Traietti wrote in an email that the construction should wrap up before the end of the fall semester, though freshmen will not be able to see the hall’s ceiling until the spring.
“The roof project is wrapping up over the next 4 weeks,” Traietti wrote. “Then, the final step will be to remove the dust netting that is up inside the hall, which will be done in late December.”
The project’s planning team was assembled by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and includes members from the FAS Department of Physical Resources and Planning.
Cambridge architectural firm Perry and Radford was hired to complete the project with oversight by LeMessurier Consultants.
According to Traietti, original materials will be used during the renovation whenever possible to closely follow the roof’s original design.
Asked if the renovations had made it more difficult to socialize over meals in Annenberg, freshmen reported that they felt the construction had a minimal impact.
“It makes it a little less aesthetically pleasing, but other than that, it doesn't really make a big difference,” Jordan S. Wallican-Okyere ’26 said.
Staff and students said the construction, while noisy, has not been a nuisance.
“I picked up a couple morning shifts a couple weeks ago, and I could hear workmen hammering on the roof, but it was not for too long, and it was not too loud,” said Patrick A. King, a Harvard University Dining Services worker.
Blake J. Bernhardt ’26, who lives in Canaday Hall across Oxford Street, said that about once a week, he would “get woken up at 8 a.m. by the workers on the roof.”
Staff expressed confusion about the timeline of the project, saying they understood renovations would be completed by the fall semester.
“I thought it was just going to be a summer job, but it stretched into the school year,” Vera said.
Traietti wrote in an email that the project was originally scheduled to span throughout the summer and fall.
"Construction is currently ahead of schedule, as the original plan was to work through mid-November with the interior debris netting to be removed at the conclusion of the fall term,” he wrote.
As the project approaches its close, HUDS staff remain optimistic that the hall’s ceiling will be revealed soon, King said.
“Whenever we get a chance, people will try to look on the roof and say ‘it’s beautiful,’” he said. “And they’re hoping that it will be completed soon.”

Roughly 30 Harvard and MIT students interrupted an ExxonMobil recruiting event at MIT last Wednesday in protest against big oil companies’ contributions to climate change.
The event — held at MIT’s Earth and Planetary Department — aimed to introduce students to internship and employment opportunities at the company. Following a similar disruption at Brown earlier this month, climate activists from Harvard and MIT held up posters, chanted, and gave speeches, decrying what they see as ExxonMobil’s corruption.
Andrew K. Chu ’26, a member of Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, said he and about 30 other protesters physically blocked the recruitment presentation to halt the event.
ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.
Saman de Silva ’26, who sang at the event, said the goal of the disruption was to send big oil companies a message that they “do not have a place on campus.”
MIT student Lyne-Nicole A. Odhiambo said educational institutions, like MIT, contradict their missions by inviting companies like ExxonMobil onto their campuses.
“Universities should not be lending our legitimacy to these kinds of companies, let alone inviting them to prey on our students’ talents,” Odhiambo said.
Welcoming companies like ExxonMobil on campus is synonymous with “condoning” the work of these companies, Chu said.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the protest. MIT spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment.
Sanaa M. Kahloon ’25, who gave a speech at the event, said big oil companies like Exxon have contributed to current disasters, such as the flooding in Pakistan.
“The connection there was that Exxon and similar companies actively harm Harvard and MIT students and their communities,” she said. “And that it’s unacceptable for Exxon to be recruiting the same students that it’s harming.”
“Recruitment is just a symptom of a broader problem that our universities have and a culpability that universities have in continuing the climate crisis,” Kahloon added.
Following the disruption, the ExxonMobil recruiters stopped their presentation and left.
Alexia G. Leclercq, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who attended the protest, described the disruption as “successful” and said she was glad the recruiters were able to hear the beginning of the speeches.
“It’s one of the strategies as part of our ongoing goal again for Harvard to cut all ties with the fossil fuel industry,” she said.
de Silva said she believes ExxonMobil uses recruitment events to rebrand its image in a dishonest way.
“When Exxon comes on campus and says they’re recruiting students so that they can change their brand, they’ve had countless opportunities to do so. And yet they still lobbied for protections against renewable energy transitions,” he said. “We have to own up to the fact that Exxon lies and big oil lies.”
Chu said he believes oil companies like ExxonMobil are trying to “profit from the destruction of our future.”
“They believe they can continue to exploit the environment and contribute to environmental destruction, get away with it, and allow that sort of narrative to propagate on campus,” Chu said.
Michael R. Waxman ’25 said he participated in the protest because he hopes to see universities give a “pedestal” to companies that will contribute to a more sustainable future.
“There’s so many young, talented people who can contribute to a more sustainable world, and that is not going to happen at Exxon,” Waxman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Retired Justice Stephen G. Breyer said “it would be fine” if Supreme Court justices were term-limited at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Wednesday.
Breyer, who retired from the Supreme Court in June before returning to Harvard Law School as a professor, avoided questions about other judicial reforms, but said he does not “see there’d be a real problem” with a limit on the amount of time justices can serve on the bench.
“It would have to be a very long term,” Breyer said, suggesting a 20-year cap. “You don’t want someone in that job to be thinking about ‘What is my next job?’ But if you had a long, definite term — like most countries have some kind of definite term — it would be fine.”
“It would’ve saved me a lot of angst,” Breyer quipped.
Breyer’s appearance at the IOP on Wednesday came after the event was postponed last month. During the forum, he was peppered with questions about abortion, the legitimacy of the court, and judicial reforms.
Breyer was asked about the dissenting opinion he authored in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson that ended constitutional protections for abortion over the summer. Breyer said the dissent was “more emotional than most,” but declined to elaborate about what took place behind the scenes among justices.
“It goes in great lengths into why it is a mistake, under the law, to depart from 50 years of precedent,” he said of the dissent, which was co-signed by Justices Sonia M. Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.
Breyer avoided questions about some hot-button issues and his views about justices who are still on the bench, often speaking in hypothetical terms to characterize legal thinkers who disagree with him.
“To ask me about the appointments and the confirmation process is like asking for the recipe for chicken à la king from the point of view of the chicken,” he said.
Asked by moderator Nancy R. Gibbs if Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 has failed at preserving the legitimacy of the court, Breyer said: “No, because we don’t know what will happen.”
“We’ve gone through a lot of difficult periods, and despite the difficulties, the country has emerged,” he said. “So naturally, I think it will emerge.”
“What I’ve seen for the last 30 years — and more than that, really, because it’s true with the First Circuit, too — this document does help to hold people together,” he said, waving a copy of the U.S. Constitution.
Breyer was asked by an audience member about the personal dynamics between justices on the bench.
“Personally, people get on,” he said.
He reflected fondly on his time serving with now-retired Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter.
“I’m not saying I didn’t like it afterwards, but we sort of meshed,” he said. “But everybody got on with everybody.”
Gibbs, the director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, asked Breyer about legal challenges facing former President Donald J. Trump.
“If you want me to talk about the Mar-a-Lago case, I’ll tell you, no, I am not going to talk about the Mar-a-Lago case,” he said.
“A girl can dream,” she replied.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 23, 2021, in the third overtime of a clash against Princeton, the Harvard sideline emptied, with players spilling onto Powers Field to mob their star wide receiver, junior Kym Wimberly. The few Crimson fans who had made the journey down to Princeton, N.J. to watch their team take on the Tigers roared in triumph as the orange and black-clad home supporters fell silent. Amidst the pandemonium, the trio of referees were reviewing a play that, Harvard players assumed, would confirm that Wimberly had gotten both of his feet down in the back of the end zone and maintained possession of the football all the way to the ground, securing the Crimson victory.
But unbeknownst to the jubilant Harvard team, Princeton head coach Bob Surace had signaled for a timeout before Crimson signal-caller Jake Smith ’21 had called for the snap. The referees, after the procedural video review of Wimberly’s successful conversion, retroactively granted Surace the timeout, sending Harvard back to the line of scrimmage for a second attempt. A few plays later, the Crimson had lost, 18-16, effectively dashing its chances at an 18th Ivy League championship. Then, the next day, the Ivy League released a statement, confirming that the timeout should not have been granted and Harvard should have won.
363 days after that fateful afternoon, the Crimson (4-1, 2-0) will have a chance at redemption when the No. 23 Tigers (5-0, 2-0) travel to Cambridge for a Friday night battle. The two teams, which are tied with Penn (5-0, 2-0) and Yale (4-1, 2-0) for first place in the Ivy League, will clash at Harvard Stadium at 7 p.m. After a 35-28 win on Oct. 7 against Cornell on ESPNU and a 41-25 takedown of Howard on ESPN3 last Saturday, the Princeton contest will be Harvard’s third consecutive nationally televised game. In a matchup that is likely to play a major role in determining the 2022 Ivy League champion, Friday’s game will be broadcast by ESPNU.
This season, the Crimson has played in a lot of close games. Each of its first four contests were decided by single-digit points, but it finally broke that streak in Washington, D.C. last weekend. In the second annual Truth and Service Classic, Harvard put up 24 unanswered points in the second half to pull away from the Bison. It was arguably the Crimson’s strongest full-team performance of the season, a showing that it will hope to build on Friday night.
“We knew what we can do on offense,” Wimberly said. “As long as all 11 are doing our job, no one can stop us. That’s what [offensive coordinator Mickey] Fein tells us every single day, so we wanted to come out in the second half and make sure we were all 11 on the same page and just come out all firing, and it happened in the second half.”
Wimberly and the offense will need to come out firing again on Friday to put away the Tigers, who enter the contest in hot form, just as they did last year, when both teams were 5-0 before the meeting on Powers Field. Princeton has not suffered a loss yet in 2022, having defeated Brown, 35-19, on Oct. 14 in its most recent game. In that contest, Tigers signal-caller Blake Stenstrom completed 19 of his 27 passes for 258 yards and three touchdowns and the three-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week, running back Ryan Butler, gouged the Bears on his 14 carries for 98 yards and two scores.
In the 2021 contest, Princeton was led by Cole Smith, who threw four interceptions against Harvard. After his graduation, he was succeeded by Stenstrom, who has been steady in his first season of consistent action, tossing seven touchdowns to just two interceptions and completing 69.8 percent of his passes. The six-foot-four junior appears to be peaking at the right time, with the Brown contest being his best game of his collegiate career. He is supplemented in the backfield by Butler, who has taken his 56 carries for 284 yards and leads the Ivy League with eight rushing touchdowns.
However, despite Butler’s standout freshman campaign, the Tigers hold the ninth-worst rushing offense in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), earning just 85.2 yards on the ground per contest on average. In lieu of a reliable ground corps, Surace’s offense relies on a potent aerial attack to move the chains. Although Princeton lost unanimous All-Ivy First Teamer Jacob Birmelin, who caught the winning conversion against the Crimson in 2021, supplementary wide receivers Andrei Iosivas and Dylan Classi will suit up on Friday. Classi, who notched a career-high 169 receiving yards in the win over Brown, leads the Ivy League in that category, 18 ahead of Wimberly and 29 clear of Iosivas. Senior tight end Carson Bobo, who caught three passes for 31 yards against Harvard last season, rounds out the group.
Princeton will hope to find success via the pass on Friday night, as the Crimson’s secondary has been its biggest weakness all season. Opposing quarterbacks have lit up Harvard for an average of 268.8 yards per game through the air, which ranks as the 22nd-worst rate in the country. However, it has started to show stronger form in recent weeks, intercepting Howard quarterback Jaylon Tolbert twice after recording just one pick in its first four games. Additionally, after being whistled three times for pass interference in the 30-21 loss to Holy Cross on Oct. 1, the Crimson secondary was not flagged last Saturday. Senior defensive backs Alex Washington and Khalil Dawsey will start on the outside, while senior defensive back James Herring and junior safety Victor Tademy will man the safety positions.
Despite its porous secondary, Harvard would not be 4-1 without its stout rush defense, a staple of Crimson teams throughout head coach Tim Murphy’s 28-year run at the helm. After allowing the fewest rushing yards per game of all FCS teams in 2021, Harvard ranks seventh so far this season, conceding just 78.0 yards per game on the ground. Defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99’s unit is led by a talented front seven, which includes stars like junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who has racked up 26 tackles and two sacks in 2022, and senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec, who won FCS Defensive Player of the Week after a season-opening, 4.5-sack performance against Merrimack on Sept. 16. Thanks to playmakers like Griffith and Leskovec, the Crimson has taken down the quarterback for a loss 20 times so far this season, which ranks second in the country. Continued success for the pass-rush unit will be key against a Tigers offensive line that allows 3.4 sacks per game, the ninth-worst rate in the FCS.
So far this season, the star of Harvard’s offense has been senior running back Aidan Borguet. The preseason pick for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year has lived up to the billing so far, following up a fantastic junior campaign with a senior season in which he has turned his 104 carries into 620 yards and seven touchdowns. Borguet leads the conference in rush yards and ranks second in yards per carry and rushing touchdowns. Murphy has turned to his star player early and often, as Borguet’s 107 touches comprise 32.1 percent of the Crimson’s total offensive plays.
“Aidan is always going to have a great game,” Wimberly said. “Our [offensive line] has been killing it this year. They have been creative massive holes. … As long as we’re all making sure we’re blocking the same guys, especially on the back end with receivers, we know that we have to get up to safeties, if we’ve gotta block a [cornerback], if we’ve gotta block a linebacker, we know that we have to make those plays for [Borguet].”
Yet if any group can neutralize Borguet, it’s the Princeton defense, which has allowed just 46.0 yards per game this season on the ground, the second-stingiest unit in the country. Thus, the key player for Harvard on Friday might be senior quarterback Charlie Dean, who has made major strides in his second campaign, completing 57.5 percent of his passes for 1,150 yards, 10 touchdown passes, and just two interceptions, both of which came in the season opener. Dean has been able to spread the ball around at will, allowing Wimberly to have by far the best season of his career – his 91.6 yards per game would be the fourth-highest in program history – and getting sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch involved as the team’s premier deep threat. The Floridian caught two long touchdown passes in the win over Howard, and has supplemented Wimberly with 314 yards so far this season. The final member of the Crimson’s stellar pass-catching trio is junior tight end Tyler Neville, who has broken out in recent weeks, scoring the first touchdown of his career in the win over Cornell.
“He’s just a lot more confident,” Wimberly said of Dean. “He knows he can make every throw, and he puts every ball on the money. I think he’s done a great job leading the team on offense.”
On Friday, Dean, Borguet, and Wimberly will hope to neutralize a potent Tigers defense that, despite losing five All-Ivy players, has been extremely strong in 2022. In addition to leading the nation in rushing defense, Princeton has allowed just 219.6 yards per game through the air and has the best turnover margin in the FCS. The fulcrum of the Tigers’ elite run-stuffing unit is junior linebacker Liam Johnson, who recorded 15 tackles against Brown, and leads the team with 43 – tied for third among Ivy League defenders. Princeton also features seven defenders who have recorded at least one interception this season. It is the country’s third-best defense at preventing first downs, and the fourth most adept at preventing scores when an opposing offense drives inside the Tigers’ 20-yard line. It has achieved all this success, according to Wimberly, by employing many of the same defensive schemes that it used to beat Harvard in 2021.
“We know they lost some big guys, but they still have some guys there who are able to make plays,” he said. “They might not be as experienced as we are, but we know that we gotta come out firing.”
If the offense continues its hot play from the second half of Saturday’s game and the defense limits Stenstrom, Classi, and Iosivas, the Crimson should have a chance to redeem itself for the 2021 loss. A victory would put it in the drivers’ seat to claim at least a share of the Ivy League title, and all eyes would turn to a Nov. 12 clash against the undefeated Quakers and then The Game against Yale a week after that. If it wins on Friday, the ultimate prize of a conference championship will seem tantalizingly close for the Crimson, but it has no margin for error, as the five consecutive Ivy League matchups that stand between now and the end of the season are all must-win games.
For Harvard fans unable to make it to Harvard Stadium, the game will be carried over the air on WRCA at 1330 AM, 106.1 FM, and 92.9 FM-HD2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a display typical of this season’s form, the Harvard men’s tennis team completed yet another weekend of dominant play at the Brown Invitational in Providence, R.I.
The Crimson, represented by junior David Arkow, first-year Marc Ktiri and sophomore Elisha Thornton, made light work of Saturday’s matches with a clean sweep against both Brown and Boston University.
Ktiri, Thornton, and Arkow all only needed two sets to prevail in their singles matches against the Terriers, winning (6-2, 6-2), (6-4, 6-2), and (6-2, 6-4) respectively. In doubles play, Ktiri and Thornton put on a dominant exhibition to win 6-1.
“In college doubles it’s one set and no ad, so it’s super important to come out with a lot of energy and fight really hard from the start.” Thornton explained. “You set the tone with your energy, and I think we did a good job of that vs. BU.”
The results of the Harvard trio’s morning matches against BU proved to be a sign of things to come later that afternoon.
In his singles contest with Brown junior Ross Cornelissen, Arkow recorded a perfect match with consecutive 6-0, 6-0 victories – a rare feat known as a “double bagel.”
“The players were supposed to do well, and we took care of business,” Arkow reflected. “The Brown game was especially good. Getting the 6-0, 6-0 scoreline was nice. A match like that is hard to come by, so those are always fun.”
In one of the closest matches of the weekend, Thornton came up with a clutch 10-8 super tiebreak victory to win his singles match against Brown junior Chun Lam 6-4, 2-6, 10-8.
“Chun is a really good player with a big serve,” Thornton said. “It was just a matter of finding the rhythm on the return games, trying to get into the games and make him play. When it came down to the end it could have gone either way, but I just tried to compete really hard, stay calm, play one point at a time, and just play with a lot of energy even though it was my 4th match of the day.”
Ktiri won his singles match handily, 6-4, 7-5, and paired up with Thornton to wrap-up Harvard’s doubles dominance with a 6-3 victory over Brown.
Sunday’s matches yielded a new opponent, with the Crimson coming up against tough competition from Quinnipiac. The Bobcats came out on the front foot and provided Harvard with stiff competition. In a morning of mixed results, Thornton defeated his singles opponent, junior Ayato Arakaki 6-2, 6-4 before combining with Arkow in a hard-fought 6-3 defeat in doubles.
Arkow emphasized the positives of that loss, the first tournament doubles match the pair had played together.
“Doubles is always tough especially because it’s short, it's only one set, it’s quick and it's hard to get a rhythm sometimes.” Arkow said. “We had good energy, good team camaraderie, but in the future there’s a lot of room for improvement and the more we play together the better we can become.”
The Crimson now shifts its focus to next weekend’s ITA Northeast Super Regionals, which promises to be a grandstand showcase of everything the team has been working towards so far this season.
With 11 of the players in the 32 man draw representing Harvard, Arkow believes the tournament is a great opportunity for the team.
“It’s exciting to host something like this where we’re bringing in the best players in the northeast,” Arkow explained. “They’re all coming to us to play, and we’ve got more than a third of the entire draw, so that just speaks to how far we’ve come as a program.”
The ITA Super Regionals will take place Friday, October 21st through Monday, October 24th at the Crimson’s home courts in Cambridge.

We get it. We’re all trudging through the nebulous five weeks that constitute midterm season. We can barely do readings, let alone function as human beings. But it’s been two months now since we moved in, and we’re already well into spooky season. There are certain things that we (including you, yes, you!) just have to get done. It’s tough to keep track of everything, so we’ve ever-so-helpfully distilled all those tasks into a to-do list for your convenience. Let us help you help yourself.
Get your shots!!!
Stop right now and go to the HUHS website. Sign up for a flu shot and a bivalent booster. I got both of mine on the same day, and it didn’t even suck that much. I got myself Panera afterward because I was very very brave. Have you made your appointment yet? You have to do it by mid-November. Do it. Do it now.
Wash your sheets. 
Hopefully, you’ve done this already, but we’re not here to shame you. It’ll be quick. Make it a party with all your suitemates. Help each other with your duvet covers. Don’t forget your pillowcase!
Wash your water bottle.
“But how can water make a bottle dirty?” MOLD. Think of the mold. Just get some hot water and dish soap up in there. It’s possible to wash out the grime while preserving the emotional support.
Take out your trash and recycling. 
You do not want a readily-available mouse house in your dorm, and trash does not spark joy. Get to that trash room. And remember to separate your recycling!
Clean your suite.
Yes, this includes your bathroom. Use that complimentary toilet brush. Borrow a vacuum. Put on some music and have an Amy Adams in “Enchanted” moment. Is that persistent cough really the “frat flu,” or is it just your dorm room covered in a thick layer of dust?
Figure out your plan for winter break.
Do you need to book a flight/bus/train? Arrange for winter housing? Beg your mega-rich friend to let you visit their chalet in the Alps? Get on that.
Figure out your Halloween costume(s). 
You have a little over a week to figure it out, and especially group costumes take forever to decide on. Get to the Garment District before all the good stuff is gone! More content on this coming, but Mario, Sexy Cat, and the Scooby Gang are always good backup options.
Check your mailbox.
If you, like me, did not realize that the upperclassmen houses don’t necessarily send you an email when they receive your paper mail like the first-year mail center did, then you probably need to do this one. Who knows what your mailbox has in store for you? I had an absentee ballot and a letter from my grandma. Speaking of…
Make sure you’re registered to vote!
Do this one ASAP. Midterms (the nationally important ones, not your overblown p-set) are coming up. Figure out who you’re voting for, order an absentee ballot if you need one, and get ready for November 8. What’s the point of being a Future Leader of the World if you aren’t doing your civic duty? International students, you can skip this one. Consider it repayment for all that time you spend on planes.
Call your parents/guardians/grandparents/siblings/friends from home.
Believe it or not, just because you’re on campus doesn’t mean you’ve been erased from your loved ones’ memories. All it takes is a 15-minute slot in the Gcal and a quick few taps on your phone. Obviously, use your discretion, but make sure to stay in touch with the people with whom you want to stay in touch.
You can knock these all out in an afternoon. And these are great because they’re a way for you to procrastinate studying with something arguably more productive in the grand scheme of things. You can’t get work done if you’re buried in your own filth and/or laid up in Mount Auburn because your water bottle is poisoning you. Take care of yourself!
