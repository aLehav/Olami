William Pope.L has crawled the 22-mile length of Broadway in New York, eaten copies of the Wall Street Journal, and tied himself with sausage links to the doors of a Chase Manhattan bank wearing only a skirt made of cash and urging passersby to pluck the bills away. Last Thursday, the Peter Ivers Visiting Artist at the Office for the Arts brought seven crying, spitting, racial slur-shouting baby heads to the Carpenter Center in “Corbu Pops,” a performance that was both humorous and disquieting.William Pope.L is a multidisciplinary artist known for his work in performance and public interventionist art which often deals with themes of race and consumerism. Influenced by movements such as DADA, the unsettling, yet intriguing “Corbu Pops” defies boundaries. “Artists like to give their talks the shape of a liquid, pour them into a container, to ‘fill,’” said Pope.L in a talk before the performance. “Mine either spill over or peter out.” If the same metaphor is applied to the effect “Corbu Pops” had, the performance splashed the container off the table. Placed in a corner of the Carpenter Center lobby, the set was a large and angled board painted with a ghostly cliff face of melting mouths, eyes, ears, and noses. Melancholy organ music played in the background as the student actors wearing over-sized baby masks with large glasses struck blasé poses watching the audience watching them or contemplating a spot on the floor or the ceiling. Questions of the viewer-performer relation were further raised by Pope.L’s shifting positions. The artist first posed beside each of the babies, slowly touching them and sending them quietly behind the cliff. He then crouched in front and watched the rest of the performance with the audience and one remaining baby. The ensuing 10-minute segment produced laughs as well as winces.“Corbu Pops’” insistent use of the word nigger was arguably its most poignant motif. The “white” babies, who wore the expression of an embittered, elderly man, repeatedly shouted the racial slur at random. The first baby to do so popped its head through a hole in the board, babbling incomprehensibly and occasionally saying the word “nigger” very clearly. She was joined by a second baby who took an angry tone with his gibberish and exclamations of “nigger.”Two screaming babies followed and eventually two more joined them. Their disagreement was silenced when one baby snorted a great throaty wad and spit it right into another baby’s face. The babies all spat at each other and then turned, and thumping loudly on the board, they implicated the audience in their argument, spitting at the crowd which stood ten feet away. This spit sequence was followed by a painfully loud pout session in which six babies gradually turned whimpers into sobs, and then into wails. The noise music score by Mark A. VanMiddlesworth ’10, who is also a Crimson Arts editor, was especially effective here. It provided a melancholy contrast to the intense action on the set and added to the general tone of irony and discomfort. The music escalated in volume with the wailing as the babies stretched their masks in agony, their faces seeming to melt like the faces in the painting. One began to howl like a coyote. Eventually the crying died away and the babies receded into their holes, leaving one remaining.Considering the fact that the babies mostly spoke nonsense and their sneering expressions never changed, “Corbu Pops” Singers Madeleine A. Bennett ’11, Adriana I. Colón ’12, Julia T. Havard ’11, Zhanrui Kuang ’12, Jia Hui Lee ’12, and Hannah R. Lewis, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, were able to convey intense emotion through only their voices and limited head and hand movements. Their attribution as singers was something of a misnomer, however, meant rather to highlight the role of the voice in the performance than to indicate actual singing.In the last scene of “Corbu Pops,” a sole baby depended almost entirely on her voice to deliver a convincing, poetic monologue regarding forms, reflections, awarenessm the present, past, and future. But her poetic speech was punctuated by passionate, intermittent ejaculations of “Nigger!” She too then receded beneath her hole and even left the room. The door closed as she continued to scream from another room until she and the music faded. Emotional and perplexing, the performance drew no clear conclusions, but maybe that was not the point. Instead of instilling any plush feeling of resolution, the “Corbu Pops” Singers bombarded their audience with semi-intelligent gibberish loaded with resonant social commentary and indecipherable meaning.“I’m suspicious of things that make sense,” says Pope.L. “Maybe I’m afraid of it. False security.”

“Nothing is funnier than unhappiness,” trash can-dwelling Nell says in the American Repertory Theatre’s current production of Samuel Beckett’s “Endgame.” Indeed, the bleak world and hopeless characters become darkly, sadly funny and wholly human in the hands of a capable team of actors and designers headed by director Marcus Stern. The phenomenal acting, skillful directing, and stunning creative vision of the play—which runs through March 15 at the Loeb Drama Center—produce a near-perfect experience of Beckett’s absurdist drama about nothing and everything.Will LeBow is Hamm, the blind leader of his twisted little family, which includes his servant Clov (Thomas Derrah) and immobile parents, Nagg (Remo Airaldi) and Nell (Karen MacDonald), who live in ashbins. Unable to move from his wheelchair, Hamm is at once in command of this bizarre family unit and yet powerless to fully control his own self. What ensues is the daily, almost ritualistic routine of these characters, who move towards no perceivable end other than death and are incapable of escape from the misery of their lives. Andromache Chalfant’s beautiful, austere set enhances this sense of powerlessness and inability to break out of a static life-in-death. A grey crater of a room floating in darkness above the Mainstage, the set is both nowhere and anywhere, a claustrophobic box with no sense of time or place. “Outside of here, it’s death,” Hamm says, but inside has an air of decay as well. The uniform lighting almost never changes, and even the characters themselves are stuck in their initial locations. Cracks and water stains blemish the drab walls; outside light is prevented by boarded windows adorned with ragged, brown curtains.Adhering closely to Beckett’s own directions, this starkness allows the interactions of the characters to become the focus. In contrast, the A.R.T.’s last staging in 1984 incited sharp criticism from Beckett himself over a too liberal interpretation. However, following Beckett’s stage directions in no way diminishes artistic freedom. A play this rich with pointed banter, absurd characters, and meaningful, open-ended questions needs no grand re-interpretation to be as effective and poignant as it is in this production.Perhaps some of the play’s emotional resonance is lost through a weak performance by MacDonald, whose Nell never hits the right note despite the actress’ considerable talents. However, the rest of the actors make up for this shortcoming.LeBow in particular is brilliant as Hamm, especially considering the challenge of being stationary and unable to express himself through his covered eyes. His Hamm is at once needy, terrifying, miserable, vulnerable, and powerful; LeBow slips into and out of all shades of emotion with ease. Even his battle of words and witty dialogue with Derrah’s Clov is pitch perfect, a delicate rhythm and timing established between the two that provides a bitterly comedic give-and-take. This verbal jousting keeps the one-act play moving at a swift pace.While LeBow is confined to his wheelchair, Derrah provides adept physical clowning, embodying Clov with distinct mannerisms (although LeBow, too, has his moments of physical comedy, wheelchair and all). Airaldi’s Nagg is amusing in an idiosyncratic way, but like Derrah, his performance fittingly becomes affecting and profound when a character dies. Yet, tragedy in “Endgame” is not necessarily tragic. Instead, it is an affirmation of one’s own existence, complete with both the good and bad that entails. As Hamm says when he discovers that Nagg is crying, “Then he’s living”—however meaningless or illogical that life might be.—Staff writer Ali R. Leskowitz can be reached at aleskow@fas.harvard.edu.

Rounding out its two-week mini Mozart festival, the Boston Symphony Orchestra paid tribute to the Austrian composer and prodigy with a tepid performance of his final three symphonies last Thursday. The night—save for a rousing performance of Mozart’s “Jupiter” symphony—could best be characterized as an uninspired rendition of Mozart’s works.Led by American-born conductor James Levine, now in his fifth season as music director, the BSO performed the last of its three-program survey of Mozart symphonies with his final, best known works.The opening piece—Mozart’s Symphony No. 39—suffered from slight problems with the orchestra’s ensemble. Shaky starts, mismatched lines, and rough endings of phrases were minor, but noticeable in the first two movements of the E-flat major symphony. Despite the few early stumbles in the performance, the BSO did not fail to deliver on charm and grace, particularly in the third movement. Levine drew out long lines ascending a hearty scale in the minuet. The clarinet solo featured in trio section easily captured the sweet, dance-like feel of the symphony’s shortest movement.Yet the nimble passagework of the symphony’s finale was not characterized by the same clarity of the orchestra’s crisp trills and clean spiccato passages in the allegro section of the first movement. Some of the running notes in the woodwinds were swallowed in the playful dialogue of the virtuosic movement. But Levine successfully led the orchestra in a crowd-pleasing, toe-tapping performance of the symphony’s last movement.In a dramatic shift from triumphant fanfare to dark lyricism, the BSO began Mozart’s famous Symphony No. 40 in G minor. With a sense of mournful yearning, the strings stressed the beginnings of the motific two-note slurs in the opening melody. The first movement tended to drag, but Levine was able to maintain the lyrical drama of the allegro molto.In the following movement, the expressive nature of the andante tempo remained intact, though at times the orchestra’s delivery seemed perfunctory—particularly at the ends of melodic phrases. However, the lively performance of the subsequent G minor minuet featuring a charming trio section was characterized by a strong sense of direction.Any sluggishness present in the first movement had fully dissipated by the start of the finale. The purposeful passagework added to the drama of the allegro assai, and Levine expertly maneuvered the harmonic modulations to build up to the piece’s climatic end. The BSO concluded the all-Mozart program with a heart-warming performance of the “Jupiter” symphony, Symphony No. 41. The initial allegro vivace felt a bit hurried at times, but the contrast between the unyielding dominance of the full orchestra sections and the ticklish charm of the second theme set off by a playful pizzicato was absolutely delightful. Levine heightened the intensity of the opening movement of Mozart’s final symphony with a never-ending series of musical twists.The muted sounds of the strings characterizing the andante cantabile movement suggested an intimacy with the music the BSO had not previously unveiled. Levine tapered off long melodic lines with taste, and the caress of the two-note slurs were particularly sensuous. A familiar four-note motif announced the opening of the finale movement of the “Jupiter,” and Levine led the orchestra through the movement’s polyphonic glory to the triumphant end. With every voice, with every introduction of a theme, the BSO fueled the finale’s drama with busy passagework and joyfully accented melodies. The pace of the movement cantered more swiftly than that of any other that night, and Levine drove the performance with an unparalleled raw energy.Despite the lukewarm start of the night, the BSO concluded the capstone of its three-part series of Mozart symphonies with a delightful performance of Mozart’s final “Jupiter” symphony.—Staff writer June Q.

There is little doubt that the United States—and much of the rest of the world—is facing an economic and financial crisis of historic proportions. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the American economy shrank by 6.2 percent, and last month the official unemployment rate reached 8.1 percent, a figure not seen in a quarter-century. Nor has the Obama administration been idle. On Feb. 17, the president signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which calls for the government to spend $789 billion over the next two years in an attempt to revive the flagging economy.
The quick action by the president and his advisors in the midst of this truly frightening recession deserves praise. We are disappointed, however, that certain members of Congress have used this recession as an excuse to enact legislation that makes it all but impossible for financial firms to hire skilled foreign graduates of American universities, including Harvard. A little-known provision in the ARRA classifies all firms receiving federal bailout funds from the Troubled Assets Relief Program as H-1B dependent, legally mandating them to find American citizens or legal permanent residents to fill any job opening before offering a position to qualified international applicants.
This new policy is misguided and harmful for several reasons. First and foremost, the turn toward protectionism in the labor market mandates that the United States essentially throw away much of its already-sparse annual investment in human capital. Every year, American colleges and universities invest millions of dollars in the education of talented students from overseas. Considering the depth of the current crisis, it is foolish to turn away thousands of highly skilled, incredibly productive, and well-qualified candidates on the basis of their nationality. 
Moreover, closing the job market to highly skilled workers from abroad is detrimental to the international competitiveness of the U.S. economy. If foreign graduates of American universities are unable to find work in the United States, they are likely to take jobs in other countries with more liberal immigration systems, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, or New Zealand. As such, the debate over the H-1B program is not merely a question of “saving American jobs”—these new policies could actually threaten our nation’s long-term economic health and our global authority.
This policy is likely to be especially devastating to international students at Harvard and similar institutions. Many firms that hire extensively from the College, Law School, and Business School are heavily affected by the new restrictions. The onerous burden placed on the financial industry by the ARRA will make it difficult for employers to hire the best and brightest at a time of international crisis.
Nor has the attempt to close America’s borders been limited to the labor market. Initial versions of the stimulus package that underwent congressional and international scrutiny would have forced all infrastructure projects receiving money from the federal government to “buy American,” using only American steel in the construction of roads and bridges. Thankfully, this provision did not make it into the final bill that was signed into law. But the “Buy American” controversy is indicative of a turn toward a protectionist trade agenda, especially in the anti-immigrant lobbies of the Republican Party and the labor-union wing of the Democratic Party. This is a trend that should be combated at every turn, especially during a recession of this magnitude.
Indeed, congressional leaders would do well to learn from the lessons of the past. Nearly eight decades ago, as the Great Depression was beginning to plunge the United States into ever-greater economic peril, Congress—at the behest of the agricultural and industrial lobbies—passed the highest set of import duties in American history, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The results were disastrous; according to the State Department, “while the tariff might not have caused the Depression, it certainly did not make it any better. It provoked a storm of foreign retaliatory measures… Such policies contributed to a drastic decline in international trade.”
The consequences of the 1930 tariff package were not limited to economic warfare; the collapse of international trade destroyed the fragile geopolitical stability that had been created after the end of the First World War. Weimar Germany’s economy, already suffering from hyperinflation and political polarization, all but collapsed as a result of the tariff war, leading to the meteoric rise of the National Socialist Workers’ Party in the parliamentary elections of 1932. Today, Hungary and Ukraine are in danger of defaulting on their already-generous IMF loan packages, while South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan fear for the long-term health of their economies. If America slides into protectionism, the relative geopolitical stability of the post-Cold War era may come into question.
During his presidential campaign, then-Senator Obama continually spoke of the need to restore America’s standing in the world. But if the Obama administration presides over a turn toward protectionism and a return to the failed methods of the past, its policies will be as misguided as those of its Depression-era predecessors. As a nation dependent on the creativity and high productivity of its tertiary sector, the United States will need all the help it can get to recover from this devastating recession. Unfortunately, current policies are likely to exacerbate, not alleviate, present economic pains. President Obama and the Democratic leadership in Congress ought to reconsider this potentially costly mistake.

Jade Goody has lived her entire adult life in front of the camera. Star of the reality TV show Big Brother, Goody became a household name in Britain through her outlandish behavior on the show, once even sparking a diplomatic incident between India and the U.K. Recently, Goody’s life hit a more tragic note with her diagnosis of terminal cervical cancer. But, true to form, this aspect of her life too will be broadcast—a television series is being filmed to document her last days.
Unfortunately, this shocking treatment of a young woman’s personal misfortune doesn’t stop with the stars of reality TV. Largely via the Internet, the public invasion of private life has infiltrated our whole generation’s way of life. Despite the contrast suggested by the opposing categories of “private emotions” and “public forums,” online phenomena such as Twitter and Facebook constantly encourage us to project our private lives into the public sphere—often to the detriment of our personal relationships.
By virtue of their indiscriminate audience and the lack of effort they demand, websites are an inherently superficial forum. Online communication occurs at the level of “networking” or “friending,” rather than by means of more authentic exchanges.
In addition, constantly projecting our lives outward has the effect of diminishing our ability to engage in private contemplation and develop sincere personal thoughts—in other words, to be alone. Many seem to find solitude so uncomfortable that they feel compelled to share their thoughts with a mass audience. As I write this article, Facebook statuses inform me that one boy in my network “is napping” and another “is hungry.” Clearly, both are in reality dedicating time to grooming their technological image.
Such is the significance attributed to presentation in the public forum that one friend went as far as to describe Facebook as another personality. The worth attributed to Internet personas warrants trepidation when we aren’t even able to have simple private thoughts without translating them into the public forum.
Even worse than the incessant expression of inane private thoughts is the attempt to express complex private emotions in Facebook’s limited text boxes. Publicly paraded sentiments are inevitably devalued as a result of their superficial context. This inappropriateness is most apparent when the most personal emotions, such as those associated with death, begin to decorate public forums. When someone with a Facebook dies, his or her profile often remains active, either to commemorate that person’s life or because the family does not have the legal rights to close it. Messages such as “U R missed, sugar,” posted by a girl with a smiling drunken profile picture, carry little genuine value on a website intended for social networking. 
In the play Loot, Joe Orton wrote, “I’m not in favour of private grief. Show your emotions in public or not at all.” The extent to which modern attitudes mimic those in Orton’s farcical play are undoubtedly a cause for concern. In order to preserve the sanctity of private lives, the invasive presence of the public sphere must be diminished. This year, the Roman Catholic Church recommended renouncing networking websites for Lent. Perhaps resisting temptation will be beneficial for us all.

In a recent op-ed, “Theater for a New Era,” Jason Wong ’10 renews his call for greater diversity in the casting of Harvard student productions and for theater that is more socially conscious. As a concerned and active student in theater—not as a representative of a group or organization—I share and admire Wong’s aspiration to develop and improve Harvard’s theater. However, I feel he ignores the truly inclusive nature of theater on our campus, and his conception of an ideal, responsible drama falls short of the stage’s full potential. Such missteps threaten to sacrifice meaningful artistic dialogue to the censorship of political correctness. 
First, Wong contends that equality in casting at Harvard exists in theory alone, not in practice. In reality, the Common Casting system, enacted every semester, is constructed to be egalitarian in both theory and practice by being widely publicized and open to not only students, but also anyone who is interested. By putting all potential actors through the same process, the theater community does its best to ensure that everyone is given a level playing field. Those who are not satisfied with the roles being offered can mount their own productions, by applying for funding and space from numerous sources.
Wong ambiguously asks directors to “reevaluate what qualities they seek when they cast their actors and actresses,” defining neither what he believes directors have sought in the past nor what he thinks they should seek in the future. If he implies that “fresh faces” and minorities need added assistance to be cast, this is condescending. Every semester, dozens of students of all ethnic and cultural backgrounds find a home in Harvard’s theater, some having never appeared in a campus production before. To suggest that any person or particular group of people needs special consideration is insulting to their abilities and to the integrity of those constructing the casts.
For these reasons and more, the theater community is at its core open to all. The appearance of it being—in Wong’s words—“exclusive and relatively confined” is perhaps a result of specific students putting in extraordinary time and effort to appear in not one, but multiple shows each semester. Moreover, these supposedly too familiar faces of Harvard’s theater begin as newcomers and continue to endure rejections and disappointments every year. Such students should be commended for passionately pursuing their craft, not used as targets for unwarranted criticism. 
If we truly care about making our campus’s theater as diverse as possible, we must consider that the possibilities of theatrical opportunities are in fact equal and open and that some students are simply not taking advantage of all available prospects. Perhaps some actors, directors, and technicians turn out only when a particular cultural group is putting on a show. At other times, students who are new to theater may be discouraged too easily by a difficult first audition. 
Propagating the false idea that some groups face an unfair bias in casting will only discourage people from auditioning in the first place. Those who do not at first find instant success should not be disheartened by a process that is inherently competitive for everyone, regardless of race, creed, or level of experience.
Furthermore, Wong’s suggestion that Harvard’s theater is confined to “precedent” and lacks “risk-taking” is absurd. The upcoming season alone displays an incredibly creative range of productions—with many diverse casting opportunities—from an original multimedia, movement-based production about love and atomic physics to a new interpretation of an ancient Greek feminist comedy. And, while I disagree with Wong’s idealization of gender-blind and race-blind casting as a kind of theatrical cure-all, it is worth noting that several of this semester’s productions do indeed take advantage of those practices.
These criticisms of unimaginativeness stem from a definition of socially conscious theater that is didactic, narrow, and unfulfilling. Some may see theater as “education disguised as entertainment,” but this ignores the wonderful complexity available in the medium. David Mamet, the esteemed dramatist and essayist, put it best when he said, “The good drama survives because it appeals… to the problems both universal and eternal, as they are insoluble.” 
In other words, great theater does not lecture, does not moralize, and does not give easy answers. It does not resolve stories into neat endings or useful platitudes. Impressive drama prods and provokes, and asks audience members to think profoundly. Relevant theater does not have to be in the style of documentary, torn from contemporary headlines. An audience may find an ancient tale or abstract parable just as resonant. Only through a relentless pursuit of truth, whether uncomfortable or uplifting, can theater inspire the kind of thought and dialogue that makes it meaningfully relevant.
Wong’s op-ed might have had the best intentions, and his desire to improve theater at Harvard is admirable. While I share his aims, I do not share his limited vision of what form they should take or how they should be achieved. I encourage Wong and those who agree with him to acknowledge that equal theatrical opportunities exist; they must only be pursued with dedication and persistence. The New Era is already here.

The future is most palpable looking out at Mumbai or Shanghai from a high floor. Here is not the septic progress of Silicon Valley or the paper profits of Greenwich’s risk arbitrageurs. Here is the stuff that would be instantly recognizable to the industrialists who built America: the hustle of men advancing fast and the delight of knowing for sure that the world is getting better, quicker. As the savings-investment cycles reach their fever pitch in South and East Asia, these societies will undoubtedly spend their trillions of reserves on infrastructure, unlocking once and for all the mass of human capital.
Proponents of the so-called technological singularity—including some of the most prominent futurologists—foresee a non-biological intelligence explosion, a future in which miraculous technology transforms human lives in manifold ways. This fascinating idea, which deserves careful attention from all well-educated citizens, turns on machines becoming smarter than humans. In such a scenario, the artificial intelligences would recursively self-teach, gaining abilities the designers could not imagine. Irving John Good described this possibility in 1965: “Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.”
More probable and more spectacular will be what I have termed the human singularity. In our lifetimes, Asia will make untold investments in roads, rail, ports, sanitation, power, water, and schools. In a case of leapfrogging, it will build only the most modern incarnations of infrastructure: adopting nuclear power fast, building advanced sewer systems in the first place, and incorporating technology in its schools from day one. In a not-so-distant generational quantum leap, literally billions of well-fed, well-read, well-entertained, and well-capitalized young men and women will suddenly enter the matrix of humanity with heightened sense of self-worth. Their contributions will be game-changing.
The small population of Americans, with the benefit of health and freedom for all, regularly produces undreamed of cultural and technical advance. Importantly, the infrastructure in America allows excellence to flourish. Brilliant young scientists are quickly identified by competitions and universities, ambitious young entrepreneurs are given capital and contacts by eager venture capitalists, charismatic young politicians are awarded power by voters, and basketball virtuosi are drafted to the NBA before the age of 20. But the less gifted are also well tended to in America. Investment in the mass of men—best achieved through investment in public infrastructure—has always been even more important than nurturing genius. All babies get vaccines, everyone has access to excellent roads and the Internet, and we all get clean water to drink. Young people have the hope that springs from a land that produced Sam Walton and Barack Obama.
Traveling in India and China, I cannot help but feel that some life is cheap there. The agrarian poor do not benefit from investment, and the backward castes are left behind. It is nauseating to think how much genius lies fallow between the Indus and Yellow Rivers. It is even more revolting to consider how many simply charitable and industrious citizens and workers are outside the system.
This is changing fast. The sewers and maglevs and suspension bridges and e-governance systems and mechanized farming and mega power plants are springing up in the greatest story ever told.
Not even three generations hence, the creative and productive powers of the largest populations will be abruptly unlocked. They will produce legions of scientists, authors, entrepreneurs, and doctors. There will be billions of dignified families, living in dignified homes with running water, armed with the self-esteem and desire that accompanies good health and literacy, mobility, and legal security. The human singularity will bring bangs of creative flowering in heretofore unknown volumes and quality, and the Asian air will be signed with newfound confidence and pride. I dare any technological singularity to match this future in scale of ambition.

No one expected the final score line at Bright Hockey Center on Friday night, least of all the Harvard men’s hockey team.Expectations were high coming into this first-round ECAC tournament matchup. The Crimson (9-16-6, 9-9-6 ECAC) had gone undefeated in its last six contests and just last weekend took down then-sixth-seeded Princeton in its final regular season game.It was only natural that no one foresaw Brown—the tournament’s 12th seed and a team that had not won a single regular season Ivy game—handing a 1-0 defeat to a team that has been 9-3-1 at home.“We’ve had a good record here at home…and we’ve been playing some good hockey down the stretch,” senior co-captain Brian McCafferty said. “When you come in and you’re [the fifth seed] and the other team’s ranked 12, maybe [an attitude] creeps in just a little bit unknowingly. But hopefully we’ve gotten that out of our system, and we know Brown’s a great team, and we’ve got to play well…to get some wins.”While there’s no denying that Harvard played technically well—it only committed one penalty, generated plenty of offensive opportunities, and outshot the Bears 39-23—whether or not the team played with all the intensity and effort required of a championship playoff match is a bit more questionable.“It was more of a work ethic thing,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We’ve got to keep moving our feet, and we have to work hard in the corners, and we have to play with desperation…That means coming out and skating as hard as you can and making every little play, and we didn’t do that tonight.”The first period was slow going for both teams, with the Crimson spending more time in the offensive zone and generating the better of the chances at goal. Despite the 13-7 shot advantage in the frame, Harvard just couldn’t generate the offensive blitz necessary to find the back of the net. Freshman forward Alex Killorn had a decent look at goal about halfway through the period, but was foiled by Brown goaltender Michael Clemente, who stopped 39 shots on the night.“They limited us to one-shot opportunities as opposed to us getting any kind of a flurry of shots,” Donato said. “Clemente was very solid, and I think they did what they needed to do. The first period, we didn’t play with the type of speed and puck movement that we were hoping for. We left a lot of shots on the board, but we never really created enough presence around their net, whether it was with traffic in front of their goalie, or plays in and around his feet, or second and third opportunities.”The Bears capitalized on the Crimson’s missed opportunities in the first period and opened up the second with strong play, quickly picking up a 6-0 advantage in shots within the first three minutes of the period. Brown nearly took the lead then when sophomore Jeremy Russell took a hard shot at net. Harvard goaltender sophomore Ryan Carroll stopped the shot, but the puck popped up over his head and seemed to be headed across the goal line. Luckily for the Crimson, McCafferty was there to make the clearance.“The second was probably their best period, and we got outworked a little bit,” Donato said.The Bears scored the one and only goal of the night at 3:19 in the third. Fourth line sophomore forward Harry Zolnierczyk scored his first collegiate goal off a close-range rebound that drifted up and over Carroll’s right shoulder.As the seconds ticked off the clock, assistant captain Alex Biega forced the issue with a few hard far-range slapshots during a Crimson power play, and junior forward Doug Rogers had a couple of attempts at net from the point. But it was too little too late. Clemente rose to the occasion and secured his first collegiate shutout.“I think energy and effort were not playoff-like, and I don’t believe we played with the sense of commitment and desperation that you need to in order to find success this time of year,” Donato said. “I thought Brown did what they needed to do.”“I think that’s a good team,” McCafferty added. “Their record might not say so, but they come to play every time that they play us. They’re a good defensive squad, and they’re scrappy around the net, and I think that showed tonight.”—Staff writer Lucy D. Chen can be reached at lucychen@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team had a rocky regular season, but at least one thing was consistent. Coming into this weekend’s ECAC first-round playoff series against Brown, the Crimson had scored at least one goal in all 29 games. Against the Bears on Friday, that changed, as goaltender Michael Clemente blanked Harvard to give his team a 1-0 victory. 
“We kind of accepted their defensive pressure a little too easily for my liking,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “We didn’t force the issue enough.”
The poor showing on the attack was the result of a lack of urgency and an unwillingness to vigorously create opportunities. In the offensive zone, the effort to win pucks physically and crash the net was nonexistent. 
“We wanted to come out today with [desperation], but it wasn’t there,” Harvard co-captain Brian McCafferty said.
The Crimson outshot Brown 39-23, but it was the quality, not the quantity, of shots that mattered.
“We need our offensive guys to really commit to generating offense and if it’s not going to come easy, we can’t be easily pushed aside,” Donato said.
In the last five minutes, moves at net finally gained ferocity and intent. Junior Alex Biega ripped a pair of slapshots on goal, but the Crimson could not finish the rebounds. After sophomore goaltender Ryan Carroll was yanked in the final minute, junior Doug Rogers created a couple of dangerous opportunities, including a shot that sprayed just wide of the post. The flurry at the end of the third period, however, was too little and too late. 
As Donato explained, the team was caught in the attitude of “hang around and see what happens,” for much of the contest.
POWERLESS PLAY
Harvard had two power plays late in the third period when Brown was whistled for holding at 9:36 and 16:12. Both chances were squandered, and neither of the man-advantage opportunities was especially strong. 
“I think that they’ve done a job against us in the special teams,” Donato said. “I thought they did a good job keeping us to one shot at a time and keeping us to the outside.”
Even with an extra attacker, the Crimson was unable to set up its offense. Passing was sloppy, the blueliners failed to control the puck, and the forwards were unable to skate in front of the crease to create distractions. There seemed to be too much puck-watching and not enough organization. 
“We have to find a way other than waiting for our opportunity on the power play to be able to create offense,” Donato said.
Harvard never had a chance to get in a rhythm on the power play, since only two penalties were called against the Bears on the night. 
Freshman Daniel Moriarty, called for slashing in the second period, was the only Crimson skater sent to the box. 
DOWN ON BROWN
Brown has historically been a tough match for Harvard. In the past three seasons, the Crimson is 1-4-3 against the Bears. 
Brown, which finished in last in the ECAC regular season standings, managed to tie Harvard twice this year before this weekend. In both games, the Crimson had a sizeable advantage in shots on target. In the first meeting in Providence, Harvard won the shot battle 38-23, but finished with a 3-3 draw. At the Bright Hockey Center in January, the Crimson posted 51 shots to the Bears’ 29 in a 1-1 tie. 
“Throughout my career, they’ve always been a tough opponent for us,” McCafferty said. “No matter what the records and what the scores, they always give us a good game and we didn’t expect anything less tonight.”
Brown is a scrappy team, and the Bears’ first goal, scored by Harry Zolnierczyk, exemplifies this. The tally was the sophomore’s second point of the season and the first goal of his career. 
Defensively, the Bears caused messy play by the Harvard attack.
“Brown did a good job limiting our real solid opportunities,” Donato said. “I thought Brown did what they needed to do. They hung around and they played and I think they deserve a lot of credit.”

Thursday's protest against potential layoffs of University workers was more than just a local effort. Students and employees protesting outside the Holyoke Center were joined by Harvard alums 200 miles away rallying outside the Harvard Club of New York
According to an e-mail sent by the "Concerned Alumni of New York," the group shares the Cambridge protesters' demands, which include that the university stop layoffs, reinstate all previously laid-off workers, and lift all hiring freezes currently in place at the University.
The organizers of the protest—including Michael A. Gould-Wartofsky '07, Kelly L. Lee '07, J. Claire Provost '07, and former campus activist Kyle Krahel '08—said in the e-mail that they would continue to rally alongside the Cambridge protesters seeking to put an end to layoffs at what they called "the wealthiest university in the world."

What is Standard Operating Procedure? That’s a question we’ve been asking ourselves for a while. All we really know is that it’s a “quarterly publication of art and architecture.”
That’s normal enough, but all the information we’ve gathered comes from a mysterious March 3rd e-mail sent over most of the House lists—and it’s one of those e-mails that begs for attention by pretending to not really care. (I guess it worked since we’re writing about it now.)
It has a bizarre minimalist format (“STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE [verb] [clause].” Now repeat that four times.), and it even seems uncertain about its own content ("content is non-specialized and may include essays, interviews, treatises, projects. propositions...”—you get the drift). Sources report it's the brainchild of Sabrina Chou '09.
But the best part of all: the theme of the first issue is “POCKETS.” How do I mitigate the fact that this is a publication about buildings and art, but its first issue will revolve around those flaps in my jeans that have become receptacles for long-forgotten fortunes from the Kong?
It started with awnings and Impressionism, but then... pockets. Really? Is that where it's at?

"Mr. Asian Sensation," held this Friday, marked Harvard's first attempt to uncover the Zoolander of the far East.
The first annual beauty pageant, held by the Harvard Radcliffe Asian American Association, sought to determine "Harvard's most attractive boys of the Asian persuasion."  The winner—Christopher A.T. Van '12—trumped the others in the talent, formalwear, and swimsuit categories, winning  a free haircut and the honor of representing Harvard at Wellesley's Mr. ASU Pageant.
According to AAA President Austin Chu '10, the event "subverted" the notion of the asexual Asian male: the dweeb who never gets the girl.
"Asian males usually wouldn't be considered very high in the pecking order...supposedly all the Asian girls want to date the white guys," Chu mused, citing the stereotype of the Asian girl-white boy pairing. "It was great to see these guys come out and be ridiculous and be overly masculine."
From rapid shirt folding techniques to drunk-singing, the contestants performed a variety of tasks designed to showcase their social acumen. But Chu is hesitant to be overly optimistic.
"I don't really know if there's Asian fever [towards] guys," Chu said. "If there is, it's fine."
Just fine? We at flyby need a prescription.
