After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I sat at home with my feet on the kitchen counter, a bad habit that my mother has hated since I was in high school. My mom walked into the room, scolding me for the transgression. I laughed, obliged, and could only focus on how good it felt to be home after my freshman year of college. My brother and father walked in a little later, joining me around the counter.
We dove into a discussion. I can’t remember what it was about. It could have been about the presidential election, the history of rap music and its relation to "Hamilton" the musical, or whether or not casting the founding fathers as people of color was an unfair rewriting of history. The topic that particular afternoon didn’t matter much. The important part is that it was intellectually challenging, as all of the conversations between the three of us have been for as long as I can remember. My family, unknowingly, was the first group to prepare me for the environment at Harvard—for classroom discussions of readings, political arguments in the library, and all the rest of the daily conversations that require me to challenge and defend my peers.
But something is different during this conversation after a year across the country. I hear myself speaking, and my sentences sound too long and too large for my kitchen. My vocabulary is foreign, and I’m using words that I’ve never wielded against my brother or my father.
As the conversations go on, I find that I’ve absorbed so many new phrases in two semesters at school. Although I’ve made them mine in section and in papers, they now feel unnecessary, as if in the process of creating knowledge and seeking truth alongside those who share my blood, they’ve lost their meaning.
Dissonance, paradigm shift, intersectionality, and code-switching come out of my mouth but, for the first time in months, they feel like the words of someone else. They are the words of a stranger, an academic, not a teenage Latino boy trying to have a conversation with his family.
Academia is a language in itself: a complicated, and often times unnecessarily polarizing part of a larger institution. The language of academia can be excessive and long-winded simply for the sake of complexity, as if being complicated means the academic’s ideas are of higher quality. Knowing the language of academia is a privilege, and often a result of whether or not people in your communities have had the chance to engage with higher education. The pursuit of knowledge, and the creation of understanding, is universal and can be accomplished by anyone, regardless of how much money you make, whether or not your parents went to college, or the complexion of your skin.
While the pursuit of knowledge is universal, the opportunities provided through academia are not. Students of color have a tougher path to entering and completing graduate school, a path that is made even more difficult if that student is a first-generation college student from a low-income background. The faculty at most universities is overwhelmingly white. In 2013, only five percent of full-time faculty across the country were Hispanic. These measures try to tell me that academia is not for me or for my brother, and separate from those dinner table conversations from home. But I know that the only thing that separates the conversations in my kitchen from those in academia is a language—one that represents nothing more than a lack of opportunity and resources.
I’ve seen the intelligence, and capability, for academia from all my Latinx peers at Harvard. They adapt and mold themselves to this new environment, pick up new phrases, figure out how to perfect them in an attempt to survive in a world that values a different kind of learning than the one they’ve perfected at home.
But the creation of knowledge is not only for those who can afford to go to college and learn this new language. The creation of knowledge is everywhere, throughout wildly different communities with different resources. It’s in Jaime Escalante’s classroom, where he managed to teach calculus to near perfection, regardless of the resources available to the high school where he taught. It’s in the undocumented high school valedictorian who will be attending Yale in the fall after escaping dangerous situations in Mexico. It’s in the story of the four Mexican immigrants whose robot was competitive, even without the opportunities afforded to other teams. These three stories are unaffected by the complex language of academia, proving that intelligence and knowledge is not simply about thesis papers and written theory.
Academia is regarded as the pinnacle of education, and it does a lot of good. But it is not the only way to gain knowledge. It is an institution that is not yet open to all, and while we fight to make the language of academia equitable for everyone, we must keep reading, writing, and thriving in the languages we already own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON — After spending most of the summer crossing the National Mall and taking in the greatest hits of the nation’s capital, I was ready to explore a landmark slightly off the beaten path.
Of course, by off the beaten path, I mean the neo-Gothic style edifice just around the corner from where I’m living. With its imposing scaffolding-encased towers, the Washington National Cathedral stands at the “highest” point in the District of Columbia atop Mount St. Alban.
Early on a Sunday afternoon, I figured it was probably time that I take an actual tour. With its flying buttresses and vaulted arches, the nation’s second-largest cathedral is just as impressive as one would imagine.
The nave is filled with stunning stained glass windows that produce an array of colors which cascade off the panes, giving the images a divine-like appearance. The Space Window, a favorite among children, even contains a piece of rock brought back from the moon by the astronauts of Apollo 11.
Based on the iconography alone, it was easy to forget that I was in Washington, D.C. and not some ancient landmark of Europe. (Although, for the number of times our guide mentioned the word “gothic architecture,” I also could have thought I was touring a certain school in New Haven.)
Admiring the cathedral’s interior, I noticed a peculiar stained-glass window. While most of the windows displayed representations of biblical stories like Genesis or Revelation, this one was different.
Predominantly composed of glass shards of red and blue, this particular piece of stained glass was a depiction of the Civil War. Complete with a group of Union soldiers on one windowpane contrasted with a Confederate flag overlooking a pair of soldiers on the other, the two images hung above an inscription paying tribute to Confederate Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.
Although initially intrigued by the uniqueness of the art, I became more interested in the sign sitting in front of the cove. It explains the recent decision of a cathedral task force to remove the Confederate flag from the images and to replace them with plain glass, citing the flag’s connections to histories of racism and oppression.
In a response reminiscent of Harvard’s decision to retire the Law School’s seal, the window underscored that our university is not alone in grappling with legacies of slavery. Harvard Law School and the Washington National Cathedral (both only a short walk from places I’ve called home) also remind me of how close these dynamic debates over symbols and legacies are occurring to where I live.
As I admired how the flecks of light from the windows cast a pale blue glow on the limestone walls, I remembered that understanding history is more than simply touring a set of grand monuments and museums carefully cultivated for public consumption this summer.
It is also about questioning legacies, exploring complex narratives, and maybe taking the time to look through a window to the past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen Blyth has resigned his post as CEO of Harvard Management Company, ending his term less than two years after he took the helm of the investment arm that manages the University’s $37.6 billion endowment.
Blyth, who assumed leadership of HMC in  in January 2015, will leave for personal reasons, according to a press release from the University Wednesday, but will remain a senior adviser to the HMC Board. His departure comes just two months after he took a then-temporary medical leave of absence. Paul Andrew, Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communication, declined to comment on whether Blyth’s resignation is related to his medical leave of absence.
Robert A. Ettl, HMC’s Chief Operating Officer, will continue to serve as interim CEO, and HMC will begin a search to search for someone new to direct Harvard’s investment pool, which helps fund everything from financial aid to House renewal at the University. Harvard has hired David Barrett Partners, an executive recruitment firm, to to lead the search.
Blyth led HMC at a time of concern about the company’s performance and turnover among its leadership. Over the last few years, the returns on Harvard’s endowment have consistently lagged behind several peer institutions, including Yale, MIT, and Princeton. After former HMC head Jane L. Mendillo resigned in 2014, Blyth was tasked with revamping HMC’s performance and restoring its dominance among university investors. Last October, University President Drew G. Faust said she was concerned about HMC’s performance.
“We obviously did not do as well as MIT and Yale and others, and that of course is a concern, and it's very much a concern for Stephen Blyth, who has been making significant changes,” Faust said in an interview at the time.
A professor of the practice of statistics, Blyth may return to teaching, according to statements from Faust and Blyth in the press release.
“Harvard has played such a positive role in my life and, as I look forward to my next chapter, I am delighted to return to teaching and interacting with the students and faculty who remind all of us at HMC why the work that is done here is so important,” Blyth said in the press release.
