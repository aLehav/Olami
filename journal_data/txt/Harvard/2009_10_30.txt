After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For such a shy bunch of fellas, French band Phoenix sure has been getting around. Jimmy Fallon, Conan O’Brien, and Lourne Michaels have all welcomed the quartet into their studios, offering them the national exposure their slow-burn career (the guys have been together for over 10 years now) has heretofore lacked. While this recent introduction to the mainstream speaks to the accessibility of their genre-spanning pop tunes, a series of recent audio and visual releases by the band highlights their passion for fostering a discourse on a staggeringly broad range of music. In doing so, it exposes the underlying complexity of Phoenix’s seemingly simple pop songs.
“Tabloid by Phoenix,” released earlier this year by painfully Parisian record-label-cum-design-house Kitsuné, is the first of these releases. Described by the band as a group of “little treasures that have had this huge impact and amazed us,” the collection is as much a straightforward mixtape as it is a full disclosure of their tastes and influences. The individual value of each of the 20 tracks on “Tabloid” is apparent to the listener—both in terms of their musical and emotional significance—as a testament to the group’s careful song selection as well as an inspired sequencing of tracks. That much of the offering centers around mid- to late-century rock and soul music is no surprise for a group that got their start playing Hank Williams and Prince covers in bars.
A number of the songs on “Tabloid” are taken from white artists as profoundly influenced by black music as Phoenix has been. Selected gems from these singers and songwriters—Elvis Costello, Dusty Springfield, Lou Reed, the Dirty Projectors, to name a few—are paired with songs by preceding, contemporaneous, and succeeding black artists—The Impressions, D’Angelo. For Phoenix, stylistic connections trump relations of chronology or influence. Placing Elvis Costello’s schmaltzy, intricate “Shipbuilding,” just before D’Angelo’s wholly different, yet still schmaltzy and intricate “Send It On” emphasizes the similarities to a point where race, genre, and era seem to no longer matter.
A complementary work, the recently released and aptly titled video piece “Musicvision Phoenix” brings their fostering of musical dialogue to a new (and more literal) level. Running nearly 70 minutes, and consisting of little more than shots of a spinning turntable with the band’s commentary edited over the music, “Musicvision” is certainly a commitment. The video, directed by Guillaume Dellaperriere, confirms what Phoenix was only able to say through implication on the Kitsuné record. A song by foundational ’60s band The Red Krayola “Victory Garden,” for instance, is featured on both outputs. Whereas on the “Tabloid,” the song’s appeal and relative significance is left for the listener to discover themselves, “Musicvision” leaves little to the imagination, and much for discussion. “The awkwardness is perfect,” declares singer Thomas Mars. Bassist Deck D’Arcy asserts that his attraction to the song comes from his inability to understand why it moves him and how it functions. “D’Angelo is the only other artist we’ve found who can manage this kind of alchemy,” he continues, oblivious to the humor of a Frenchmen even knowing who D’Angelo is, let alone calling him a musical master.
While both of these releases have certain appeal for fans of the band, the value of spending 70 minutes listening to four strangers blabber on (with subtitles, to boot!) about their favorite songs may seem dubious. But regardless of one’s relation to the band, there is something undeniably modern and worthwhile in hearing people so deeply moved by such diverse forms of music speaking as much from their standpoint as musicians and songwriters, as from the position of common music lovers. Songs are held up as often for their craftsmanship as their ability to enhance everyday life. Tracks are often characterized as “living room songs,” or “songs for long car rides,” so much so that you can’t help but see for yourself.
There’s something both charming and surprisingly relatable about four guys from Versaille, a tiny town only minutes outside of Paris, characterizing the musical offerings of their childhood as on par with, say, life on Venus, or China during the cultural revolution. As guitarist Laurent “Branco” Brancowitz cryptically explains, “The thing about being French is that everything that’s good is far away, and thus more magical. Anything that’s far is hazy, and anything that’s hazy is better... That’s our benediction, coming from France, a place so remote.”
With “Tabloid” and “Musicvision,” the four lifelong friends that comprise Phoenix give us entrée into the most profound and lasting of their “Aha!” moments, recalling a line from that most French of films, “Jules and Jim.” On the friendship of the two protagonists, the film’s narrator comments, “Each taught the other his language and culture... They shared their poetry and translated them together.

Parting the curtains of “In the Courtyard of the Beloved,” the viewer enters a sacred alcove of bright colors, intricate geometric decorations, and minarets. The installation—part of the new exhibition at the Peabody Museum, “Sacred Spaces: Reflections on a Sufi Path”—sweeps the viewer away from the gallery, flies him across oceans, pulls him through the crowded streets of Delhi, and finally ushers him into a Sufi shrine. There, the digital still images and audio recordings bring into view a personal practice of a mystical dimension of Islam.
“In the Courtyard of the Beloved,” makes clear the exhibition’s pedagogical purpose. A collection of photographs, calligraphic works, and mixed media montages, “Sacred Spaces,” presents a pluralistic view of Islam as it is expressed and practiced today. In a time when the religion is oft associated with terrorism, extremism, and oppression, the exhibition offers a nuanced view of Islam and is careful to depict its multifaceted nature.
“Sacred Spaces: Reflections on a Sufi Path,” and its companion display “Sacred Spaces: The World of Dervishes, Fakirs, and Sufis” at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, are part of a greater initiative, for which faculty and students are also advocating, to use art to educate the Harvard community about the religion of Islam, and by extension, Middle Eastern cultures. And for artists within an Islamic tradition who wish to educate a Western audience, these social motivations must be balanced against their aesthetic goals.
A CREATION STORY
Islamic art, as in many other religious traditions, has historically been conscious of its inseparability from the divine, a sentiment that continues to operate within the on-campus Islamic community.
“God bestowed artistry and other gifts to mankind,” says Nafees A. Syed ’10, a practicing Muslim and Crimson staff editorial writer. “Even when Solomon built this beautiful temple there was a recognition of where the gifts came from.”
Na’eel A. Cajee ’10, president of the Islamic student society, sees this relationship as reciprocal.
“When you produce something that is beautiful it is usually an attempt at perfected expression or proportion,” he says. “Art, for me, is striving for perfection but ultimately falling short of the Perfect, which is God. This is the idea that is behind art and is an inspiration for artists.”
For the general Harvard community, however, Islamic art’s relevance is not necessarily its religious import but its undeniable cultural significance.
“First of all, you have to think about religious traditions as cultural phenomenon embedded in context—social and political and literary and artistic,” says Professor Ali S. Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures and Associate Director of Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Islamic Studies Program. “Great works of Christian secular music are tied closely to piety. We are used to thinking about religion in theological forms. Religion is such a complex phenomenon that religious discourse can be found in many other forms. Muslims in the Islamic world are no exception.”
Next semester, Asani will be teaching a General Education class that will serve as an introduction to Islam and Muslim culture through the arts. The class will explore a wide range of Muslim art forms, including the architecture of mosques, poetry, Koran recitation, devotional song, and calligraphy. “We will study them and try to understand them for their own aesthetic value based on the culture they’re coming from and use those art forms as lenses to understand Muslim culture,” Asani says. Students will then have the opportunity to design a mosque for an urban American landscape, create a poem in English using the structure and symbolism of a genre of Islamic poetry study, and produce their own works of calligraphy so that they can participate in and understand the practice of Islam. Using art in such a way helps students engage with the religion in a more meaningful way.
“The representations of Muslims have been so negative,” Asani says. “How de we counteract Islamaphobia? I am a firm believer that one way in which people can understand each other is through the arts.”
ARTISTIC EFFECT
Samina Quraeshi, the first Robert Gardner Visiting Artist Fellow at the Peabody Museum, is currently using her time at Harvard to put this notion into practice. Quraeshi’s work, which is currently displayed in “Sacred Spaces” as part of her fellowship, attempts to translate her conception of homeland—a complicated interweaving of her birth in India, Pakistani Muslim upbringing, and Catholic education—into a cultural experience.
Fundamentally believing that the personal cannot be separated from artistic production, Quraeshi’s visual pieces are permeated by her lived encounter with her own strain of the religion, Sufism.
“I don’t think one can avoid the influences of one’s place of birth,” says Samina Quraeshi.“You are raised [in a certain] way and the colors and the textures and all of the sensory experience you are surrounded by are etched in your brain.”
Despite the highly personal nature of her art, the work has broader social implications, namely to add nuance to what she sees as a typically monolithic portrayal of Islam. In conjunction with her new book published by the Peabody Press—“Sacred Spaces: A Journey with the Sufis of the Indus,”—the pieces on view portray the multiplicity found in Sufi traditions. “This book and exhibition is a personal and artistic act of resistance against those forces both within Islam and outside of it that seek to deny such nuances, to silence the voices of mystics, and to distill the diversity of Islamic piety into something essential, unitary, and uniform,” Quraeshi said in her speech at the opening of “Sacred Spaces.”
The Peabody exhibition was originally intended to be a display of her photographic documentation of the Muslim sect. However, Quraeshi felt that the photographs would have alone failed to portray a holistic view of Sufism, one that would be able to educate a Western viewer.
“I was struggling to express Sufism, and I felt that the photographs were not enough,” the artist says. “I wanted to express the emotional experience, and that’s where the art came in.”
ESCHEWING THE LABEL
While Quraeshi believes it unorthodox to use contemporary art to a humanizing anthropological end, such is a necessary gesture to accurately depict the many facets of Islam to a Western audience.
“I want these images to speak across the barriers of cultural mores, linguistic obstacles, and obscure practices,” Quraeshi said at the exhibition opening.
But despite her efforts to inform the Harvard community about Sufism, Quraeshi does not want to be considered an Islamic artist. “It’s a sensitive subject because of all of the horrible things being done in the name of Islam,” she says. “It’s sort of like calling a woman a female artist. You are either an artist or you are not.”
This emphasis demonstrates Quraeshi’s nuanced approach to Islamic culture; her rejection of broad categorizations and the accentuation of the personal in her art sensitize her viewers to the complexities of an important world religion. Ultimately, this even-handed approach—balancing accessibility with personal aesthetic value—is important for a responsible ethnological presentation of Islam.
“I think the goal of the Peabody is to represent the traditions of man,” Quraeshi says. “My work is the living tradition of an area of the world that is very underrepresented. The exhibition is very much in the idea of inclusion and exposing the students to not only the history of mankind but also the living tradition as it is practiced today.”

Finance and astronomy may not be completely incomprehensible, but in some ways, the technical jargon and inherent speciality of these fields can make them seem as boring as accounting and as intimidating as rocket science. Recently, in an effort to make their areas of interest more relevant and accessible for their peers, the Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe (STAHR) and A Drop in the Ocean (ADITO), a non-profit microfinance organization run by Harvard students, have similarly adapted their interests for artistic purposes.
Over the years, art has demonstrated its love for the celestial, from Vincent Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” to Lord Byron’s, “She walks in beauty, like the night / of cloudless climes and starry skies.” Tonight, astronomy returns the favor. To celebrate a convergence of art and astronomy, STAHR, an organization devoted to the observation and study of the cosmos, is hosting a poetry event at the Loomis-Michael Observatory.
With this event, STAHR hopes to remind Harvard students of the basic wonder and beauty of the night sky. It will provide telescopes and display art pieces with astronomical themes. By making it easy for students to observe the skies, STAHR seeks to reconcile the perceived disparity between the technical knowledge of a specialist and the simple appreciation of a stargazer.
“Astronomy has gone through this metamorphosis. Look at the Greek astronomers,” says Lauren M. Weiss ’10, a STAHR officer. “They were just ordinary people who looked into the sky to try to understand it...But as science, and especially physics, has advanced, astronomy has too. Now to be an astronomer, it takes years to understand what is going on in the universe. This is unsatisfying to the average person, who looks up to the sky, wonders, and is truly inspired.”
In anticipation of this inspiration, an open microphone will be set up for those who wish to wax poetic about their observations or thoughts. “We need to find a way to show how our new discoveries are connecting to that sense of wonder, because if they can’t connect, they aren’t important to humanity,” Weiss says. “If we can’t connect to the world at large, what we do is only important for us.”
Besides engaging the public with astronomy in this setting, STAHR also seeks to bridge the traditional gap between how the night sky is observed by an artist with his naked eye, and an astronomer with his technologically privileged view. “Often art is coming from the perspective of artists here on Earth that are looking at the brightest objects in the sky,” Weiss says. “However, astronomers study the faintest and most distant objects in the sky...Now with Hubble, other Earth-based telescopes, and the Internet, we have been able to show these fainter and more distant objects to the public. I think with this new technology, it will influence and inspire a new generation of poets and artists.”
With a similar goal of inspiring artistic creation, ADITO encouraged its interns to take photographs during their travels this summer. Last week, ADITO, which is committed to providing small loans to mostly female clients in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, opened an exhibition of these photographs at “Swing into the Sackler!” a night event held by the Harvard Art Museum Undergraduate Connection. The organization has relied largely on photography to garner support and raise awareness about its efforts. With their documentary value and emotional appeal, the photographs feature individuals and landscapes that ADITO members encountered on their travels.
“For me, I never really [before] took that many photos on one trip. It was a great opportunity to begin arranging photos—not just putting people together and telling them to smile,” says Simon Mahler ’10, the club’s chief executive officer, who spent a summer in Benin. “You really start playing with the camera, and you do learn more about photography.”
ADITO Chief of Operations Officer Polina Krass ’11 says that the task of documenting experiences with photography reveals how important microfinance is to those it has helped. “Microfinance is much more than an idea. It’s much more than a strategy. It’s about empowering people,” Krass says. “And I think empowerment is something easier captured in photography than anything else.” She gives an example of one of the photographs shown at the Sackler: the women, pictured smiling and clapping ebulliently, are in the act of reciting an oath, promising to return the money loaned to them.
Aside from showing their photographs to turn attention to their efforts, ADITO members hope to sell crafts handmade by the women who received loans, according to Valerie N. Chadha ’11, the chief financial officer.
“The term ‘microfinance’ tends to turn people off,” Krass says, explaining the importance of having an artistic pathway between her specialized interest and the broader community. “They say they aren’t interested in banking or finance. To have their first vision of microfinance be scenes of people in developing countries opens a lot of windows for us to talk to them about what it is.”

The phenomenon of multiculturalism in today’s world often becomes so muddled and clichéd that the cultures represented become vitiated and disconnected from their origins. The Silk Road Project—whose five-year residency at Harvard culminated last Thursday evening with a thrilling performance and ceremony in Memorial Church—is an antidote to this superficiality of the multicultural society. By using expert artists and scholars, the Project seeks to teach communities worldwide about the human commonalities and peculiarities that cultural exchange brings to light.The project was born out of a series of conversations between cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and Harvard humanities professors in 1998 about exploring cultural connections through music. Ma sought virtuoso musicians from a variety of traditions to form the Silk Road Ensemble, a group committed to exploring and sharing these traditions and creating new cultural forms—much like travelers did on the famous Silk Road trade route 1,000 years ago.The project then grew to include international tours and workshops, with the mission of uniting the world’s neighborhoods through music. The ensemble has since commissioned works from across the globe and led numerous tours across Europe, Asia, and the Americas.When it began its residency here in 2004, the project included a number of educational programs, including small workshops with Harvard undergraduates. In the five years thereafter, the project’s scope expanded to include programs in Chicago and New York City middle schools.The program in New York, called Silk Road Connect, intensifies a pilot program first implemented in Chicago in 2007. The program was motivated by troubling statistics that connected a lack of academic interest in middle school with low college graduation rates, says Laura Freid, executive director of the Silk Road Project. Silk Road Connect seeks to inspire “passion-driven learning” through its integration of Middle Eastern and Asian studies into existing curricula. “As a young student, it’s important to be excited about yourself as an individual knowledge seeker and also as someone who knows who they are and who they are in the world,” Fried says. “Sixth grade is the time of your life when you’re looking for connections.” Initiated this fall, Silk Road Connect employs a variety of tools—including workshops with the ensemble and partnerships with major institutions—to explore the effects of cross-cultural exchange. Students receive DNA testing sponsored by National Geographic to explore their ancestry, for example, and work with an existing gallery on the Silk Road in New York’s National History Museum.The cross-cultural exchange epitomized by the Silk Road Ensemble mirrors the daily life of American youth, in particular those living in the city, says Steven Seidel, director of the Arts and Education program at the Graduate School of Education (GSE). “This generation of new cultural forms is a reality for sixth graders, but the traditional curriculum does not address these issues well. ”Freid adds that the ensemble itself is particularly important in achieving this. “Kids are excited because they see that the diversity on-stage is similar to the diversity they’re living,” she says.The project’s renewed focus on educational programs contributed to its decision to have this year’s residency headed by the GSE. From 2005 to 2008, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences headed the residency, according to Seidel.“They wanted to go deeper into the conversations about how you make partnerships between arts organizations like Silk Road and public schools work, and a lot of us here at the GSE have done that kind of work for a long time, both with arts organizations and with other nonprofits,” Seidel says. Much of this work is based in Project Zero, a Harvard organization that Seidel directed for eight years and the nation’s oldest and most well-known research center of learning through the arts.In last Thursday’s concert the audience had a chance to experience firsthand the multicultural themes explored by the Silk Road Ensemble. Ma, Russian violinist Jonathan Gandelsman, and pianist Charlie Albright ’11, performed the second movement, “Pantoum,” of Maurice Ravel’s piano trio. The piece is usually associated with the Western classical tradition but, as Ma explained, Malaysian dance forms heavily influenced Ravel during his attendance of the World’s Exhibition in Paris in 1889.Later, six other undergraduates joined the Silk Road Ensemble to play music of Turkmen, Armenian, and Yiddish influence, using non-Western techniques and instruments to create music that was both captivating and unfamiliar. With irregular rhythms, a Japanese flute, and a hand drum, the ensemble seemed to conjure fantastic foreign landscapes.Christopher D. Chang ’12, a violist who performed in the concert, says that the ensemble’s style of playing was a refreshing change from the often sterile performance of Western works. “We learned by interacting and playing with each other rather than analyzing the music to death,” he says. “It was less about the quality of the sound than about the colors we created.”The audience’s thrill—evoked by the musical world the ensemble showed them—was manifest; they were on their feet and cheering three movements before the conclusion of the final piece. To perform such energetic non-Western music amongst the pews and crosses of Memorial Church seemed a fitting emblem of the Silk Road Project’s quest for genuine multiculturalism.

The madness of the French Revolution and the madness of the everyday overlap and intertwine in “Marat/Sade,” the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Peter Weiss’ 1963 play, “The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade.” The production, which opens tonight and runs through November 7 at the Loeb Experimental Theater, tells the story of that infamous character for whom the term “sadism” was coined, the Marquis de Sade, and his internment at the Charenton Asylum shortly after the French Revolution. A play within a play, the show aims to combine its two settings—revolutionary Paris and an asylum fifteen years later—with an emphasis on the similarities between the seemingly disparate conditions.
The story is partially based on true events. In the early 19th century, Sade was indeed imprisoned in Charenton, where he staged performances using other inmates as actors. The play within “Marat/Sade” focuses on just one of these stagings: Charlotte Corday’s murder of Jean-Paul Marat at the height of the French Revolution’s political terror.
Originally in German, Weiss’ play saw its first English production in 1964, when it was taken up by the Royal Shakespeare Company under the direction of Peter Brook. According to director James M. Leaf ’09-’10, this production had served as a commentary on the Cold War; Marat was used as an allegory for East Berlin, Sade as an allegory for the West. This particular interpretation, which pitted one titular character against the other, possesses little contemporary relevance in Leaf’s play, which lays its emphasis more on the relationship and similarities between the two characters, rather than on their opposition.
“I see Sade and Marat as much more closely allied in some ways,” Leaf says, who used the interplay of the two temporally-divided settings—the asylum and the revolution—to help create the bond.
According to Christine E. Gummerson ’12, who plays Rossignol, there are many parallels between the events in revolutionary France and the madhouse. “There is this feeling of ‘What have I done to deserve this? Why me?’” she says. In both situations, the victims—the poor and the mad, respectively—feel unfairly punished. With this injustice comes desperation, and it is desperation, Gummerson says, that can bring people to the terrifying violence that marked the revolution.
This violence is evident in the asylum as well, says Leaf. “A huge part of this play is the idea of violent demasking of violence and violence that’s made to look like help.” The brutality of the asylum’s overseers, which they claim is for the good of the inmates, mirrors the Parisian proletariat’s view of violence—epitomized by the guillotine and the storming of the Bastille—as a means to a better end.
“These people are put in an insane asylum,” says Elyssa K. Jakim ’10, who plays Charlotte Corday. “They’re punished for what they are rather than what they’ve done.” For Leaf, this division between crimes of action and crimes of being lies at the heart of the production. “If you can truly understand the difference between them,” he says, “you can understand the play.”
An understanding of “Marat/Sade,” therefore, relies on an appreciation of its complementary contexts. The production aims to use asylum and revolution to emphasize one another and comment on the present day. In doing so it hopes to show that violent desperation is timeless and that it can bring any of us—all of us—to the brink of insanity.

During Larry King’s seemingly interminable coverage of Michael Jackson’s untimely death this past June, an earnest correspondent ventured into the late singer’s vacant Neverland ranch to conduct an exclusive tour. While detailing the hard-hitting intricacies of Jackson’s bedroom door, a slim shadow appeared briefly, appearing to cross the corridor before disappearing. Within hours, reports surfaced that CNN had possibly captured footage of the ghost of Michael Jackson. Though the hasty hypothesis was certainly an outlandish one, it seemed to pale in comparison to the host of bizarre tales that had swirled about the eccentric entertainer for most of his life.
In the days and weeks following Jackson’s passing, the media divided airtime between grimly recapping the murky details of his personal life and reverently exalting his artistic genius, which was to have been showcased in a series of sold-out London concerts. The ill-fated tour, billed as “the final curtain call” by Jackson himself, is now the subject of a documentary entitled “This Is It.” Directed by Kenny Ortega, Jackson’s creative partner, the film provides an unusually pared-down view of the performer at work, far from the manic frenzy that seemed to characterize much of his esteemed career.
Ortega, a long-time Jackson collaborator, refrains from digging up archival footage of past stage endeavors—one tear-streaked face amongst a sea of roaring spectators, the brief burst of stunned applause from a 1983 audience witnessing the moonwalk for the first time—and instead uses the bulk of the film to offer a glimpse of his plans for the future. Not content to simply belt out his greatest hits to a packed arena, Jackson’s best-known songs are paired with various elements of cutting-edge technology to create what would have been a truly innovative stage experience—wardrobe designers were working with scientists to incorporate new visual effects into the Jackson’s costumes, while his classic music videos were being reimagined and reworked to fit new choreography.
Though Jackson and Ortega shared directorial duties while producing the tour, “This Is It” witnesses the extent to which Jackson’s relentless perfectionism drives the entire show. Far from the shaky, soft-spoken intonations audiences are used to hearing from Jackson, he speaks in an unmistakably succinct, deliberate manner throughout the film. Issuing sometimes minute and nuanced commands to a corps of dancers, musicians, choreographers, and crew, he manages to dole out his authority with an uncanny blend of warmth and immediacy. Responding to a musician’s reassurance that he’ll eventually achieve the sound they’re looking for, Jackson brings the playful exchange to a close, succintly stating, “Well, get there.”
Just as the film is missing much of the rabid fan appreciation typical of Jackson’s shows, his rehearsal performances reveal a subdued version of the explosive entertainer’s song and dance capabilities. Often reminding his colleagues that he’s conserving his energy for the actual show, it’s hard not to wonder just what the final product would have looked like, though the film certainly captures a great deal of his signature showmanship. Still, the lack of opening-night caliber fanfare allows “This Is It” to highlight the dual nature of Jackson’s creative vision. Simultaneously exacting and nurturing, he pushes his colleagues to the full extent of their abilities. Unable to signal to his young guitarist the intensity with which he would like her to approach her guitar solo, he finally sings a high note, instructing her to allow her guitar to wail accordingly, noting, “This is your time to shine.”
If Ortega seems intent upon illuminating Jackson’s subtleties in “This Is It,” it’s because the director is all too familiar with Jackson’s creative process, having worked with Jackson on his last two world tours. Ortega utilizes split screens to show the barely discernible variations of Jackson’s dancing, jerkily grooving to the same song on three different occasions. He often focuses on his facial expressions—a tense grimace taking shape when something doesn’t sit right with him and a serene smile of satisfaction when a musical number has gone off without a hitch—as well as his hands, which never seem to stop moving, giving nearly imperceptible cues to musicians and dancers, silently conducting the music, and expressing the sentiments behind the lyrics of his songs.
After a particularly rousing rehearsal of “Billie Jean,” Ortega makes his way through a group of slack-jawed dancers to the stage, summing up Jackson’s performance with a single word: “Church.” Indeed, “This Is It” is replete with reminders of Michael Jackson’s unique greatness, from the fancy footwork to the sparkly accoutrements to the piercing vocals. Yet the poignancy of the film hinges on the less obvious aspects of Jackson’s accolades—his extensive creative and technical involvement in the execution of a large-scale concert event and the hushed awe of all of his colleagues. By serving as a quiet tribute to Jackson stripped of the usual fanfare, “This Is It” exposes a side of the artist that would likely have remained hidden if he had lived to complete the tour.

Beating a five-time platinum record isn’t easy. Coming off their wildly successful self-titled first album, Wolfmother had pretty lofty expectations to meet. While frontman Andrew Stockdale had been hailed as a pioneer of hard rock revival, he was in danger of getting locked into Nickelback syndrome, making a career out of rewriting the same song. On “Cosmic Egg,” however, Wolfmother—with an all-new lineup supporting Stockdale—prove they have the talent and creativity to sustain their remarkable success. With intense, intricate, and looping guitar riffs, high pitched, Zeppelin-esque screeching, and rough, blazingly fast drum beats, “Cosmic Egg” is over an hour’s worth of epically long, stadium-worthy anthems.
Admittedly, “Cosmic Egg” does share a number of features with Wolfmother’s self-titled debut. Both albums’ tracks are filled with similarly rendered electric guitar sounds, the very occasional switch to acoustic segments, interspersed squeals, and hearty track lengths. Rapid beats are repeatedly counterbalanced with the scattering of double time, slower tempo sections. But “Cosmic Egg” takes a step towards even harder ’60s rock riffs and heavy metal intensity.
Wolfmother’s unexpected increase in energy is best evidenced on “New Moon Rising,” the album’s first single and standout track. A whirlwind of catchy guitar solos and pounding drums, it’s as fun to listen to as “Joker and the Thief” from their debut. Nearly 64th note bass drum and cymbal beats driving the entire track, it’s hard to keep up. Arpeggios of electric guitar fill a chorus of forceful, ominous lyrics: “She don’t mind / She got the time / I see the new moon rising.”
As usual, each song’s backbone is a distinct and catchy guitar lick. Sometimes these guitar melodies are comparable to the coarse, raspy, and low-pitched riffs played by the Black Keys; “Pilgrim,” “Phoenix,” and “White Feather”—the album’s slower, sparser moments—are prime examples of this. “Pilgrim” starts with an upbeat, swing-feel guitar riff that is soon joined by percussion. “She’s got hands that go inside my mind,” Stockdale moans. The quick pace suddenly slows to half as fast, adding to an overall blues style maintained throughout the track.
Alongside this more spartan ethos, “Cosmic Egg” provides several tracks to balance with a heavier, metallic sound. From beginning to end, “10,000 Feet” is filled with dark, sadistic, repeated low-note chords, a dominating drum set, and shrill, bestial screams. “Sundial” features intricate guitar riffs sequenced with driving, propulsive bass strangely reminiscent of a Black Sabbath throwback. The tracks maintain Wolfmother’s characteristic clumsy, hard rock style.
The disc boasts an impressive and well-arranged combination of bluesy and frenzied songs, and Wolfmother can remain booming at full blast without growing stale. Six-minute epic “In the Castle” contains interspersed fast and slow tempos and a very classic rock feel. Starting off with nearly 40 seconds of silence, the track begins with slow, calm, and collected vocals. This is quickly joined by powerful half-note guitar chords and a guitar lick that leads into a faster tempo and repeat of the verse. With lead singer Stockdale’s passionate wail and the grandeur and straightforwardness of the melody, it sounds something like Led Zeppelin with a more metallic edge.
While “Cosmic Egg” clearly isn’t the most diverse album, this really doesn’t detract from its overall success. If anything, it provides a unity of sorts. Almost three years after the band’s thrilling debut, Stockdale and Wolfmother’s simple formula sustains yet another record. A heavy metal behemoth, “Cosmic Egg” is proof that, when it comes to quality hard rock, there can’t be too much of a good thing.

“America: I window-peeped four years of our history. It was one long mobile stakeout and kick-the-door-in shakedown. I had a license to steal and a ticket to ride… I am going to tell you everything.” At the beginning of James Ellroy’s latest novel, “Blood’s a Rover,” the third installment of his “Underworld U.S.A. Trilogy,” one of the book’s three narrators proposes to retell the history of America between June 14, 1968 and May 11, 1972, and unsurprisingly, the novel’s perspective on that history is one of general brutality, filled with accounts of racism, corruption, hatred and violence.
“Blood’s a Rover” comes as the final episode in a trilogy that recounts the tumultuous times of the American Sixties, though it can be read as a stand-alone novel. Its predecessors “American Tabloid” and “The Cold Six Thousand,” set throughout the early and mid-60s, are retellings of such events as the assassinations of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., with rotating chapters containing each of three narrator’s points of view. Ellroy continued this three-narrator formula in this latest novel, following the ex-cop and mob affiliate Wayne Tedrow Jr., FBI Special Agent Dwight Holly, and burgeoning private investigator Don Crutchfield through their increasingly intersecting journeys in the political and social climate of the final phase of the 60s.
Initially the three narrators are leading separate lives, yet it soon becomes clear that their three paths intersect through the events of a mysterious unsolved robbery and an elusive woman named Joan Rosen Klein. Each protagonist is searching for something related to both Ms. Klein and the crime, a search that carries them all down a communal path of violence, hatred, and destruction. Ellroy’s is a well-crafted foray into the dark-side of America, but the author’s attempt at absolute historic totality hinders the novels complete success. Ellroy’s desire to account for almost every day in the book’s nine-year time span causes the narrative to drag, and because of the novel’s extreme length, readers not completely invested in the minute details of the characters’ lives will find themselves struggling at times to keep reading.
Like much of Ellroy’s fiction, “Blood’s a Rover” is at least in part homage to pulp literature—a genre whose mandate is one of instant gratification. But at 640 pages, Ellroy’s latest dwells too often and for too long on aspects of the plot that, for their sheer monotony, never seem important. The truth behind the robbery and Joan Klein’s identity are both revealed so slowly that the value of surprise is squandered. None of the three protagonists are ever completely invested in the novel’s seeming climax, rendering much of the book’s attention to plot somewhat irrelevant. One passage exemplifies Crutchfield’s divided attentions throughout the novel. “Memo: work on your mother’s file. Query the Racine PD. Memo: your case file is updated. Your case is dead-stalled. Memo: get your ass to the rockin’ D.R. and voodoo-vamped Haiti.” The split focus and meandering pace of the novel give the sense of only a passing interest in the novel’s supposed central event.
Ultimately, however, the goal of ”Blood’s a Rover” is to depict a certain time period in American History in a new light, and it fully succeeds in accomplishing that goal. Ellroy explores the time period at length and ends up creating a fictionalized world behind real events, depicting the fallout from Martin Luther King Jr.’s death, the election of President Nixon, the presence and fear of communism, and the eventual death of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover from a more cynical perspective than the history books. His account of the era orients the readers in the plot and leaves them with a true sense of the anger, both righteous and profane, that highlighted the period. Ellroy’s distinctive style—the brief, spare syntax reminiscent of hardboiled detective fiction—sets a dark tone for the novel and lends itself to this retelling of history. Yet, while the history is interesting, the unfolding of the mystery of the robbery and Joan Klein dictates the pace of the novel, and there Ellroy falls short.
Looking back over the events of the nine years of the novel in the epilogue, a narrator notes that he’s “paid a dear and savage price to live history.” The message is clear: the history of America is brutal, violent, and full of pain. Indeed Ellroy succeeds at bringing that point across through the macabre events of “Blood’s a Rover.” Yet, it seems clear that he could have used less words to create a sense of suspense and anticipation for its climax, without sacrificing that message. Instead, when the long-awaited climax arrives, the reader is so distracted by all the unrelated corruption and death that the answers to the puzzle do not seem very important. Such strengths and shortcomings leave “Blood’s a Rover” a fitting, though far from perfect conclusion to Ellroy’s trilogy.

“Hence the vanity of translation;” Percy Shelley wrote, “it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principles of its color and odor, as to transfuse from one language into another creations of a poet.” What the poet is communicating here is poetry’s fascination with presentation, its syntax, sound, rhythm—aspects that depend on its language of origin—so that there is an almost absurdly destructive quality to any translation. Though its semantic meaning can hold, translation risks the utter loss of all emotional register. This theoretical problem manifests itself pertinently in the anxiety that a translation is not identical to the original, and therefore inauthentic. It’s a troubling feeling to go to the library or bookstore to pick up a foreign poet, only to find three or four different translations available. Which is the right one?
It was with all of these anxieties and prejudices that I approached Edward Snow’s new translation of Rainer Maria Rilke, the early 20th century poet who wrote in German (though he was born in Prague, at the time under Austro-Hungarian control). Before I evaluate the translation, I must admit that I do not speak a single word of German. Accordingly, I will address the book as a reader for whom it was intended: one who does not know the language and therefore needs another to present Rilke’s poetical universe.
Like many, my introduction to the poet was through Stephen Mitchell’s celebrated 1989 translation of Rilke’s selected works. I know this collection intimately, and I’ve even committed a few of Mitchell’s translations to memory. I’ve also read Robert Bly’s 1981 translation, and David Young’s attempt at Rilke’s “Duino Elegies.”
The first thing to notice about Snow’s volume is how thick it is. Though this is technically another “selected” Rilke, it is far more thorough than Mitchell’s or Bly’s. The sheer amount of translation here is both admirable and convenient; it is the most complete recent collection of Rilke’s works in English. This is the culmination of Snow’s several previously-published translations of Rilke’s individual volumes, revised and collected in this larger book.
While Mitchell’s translations are looser and more creatively liberal, Snow’s have an interest in direct syntactical facsimile; with a more direct approach to the formulation of Rilke’s images. In “Going Blind,” a poem from “New Poems,” Rilke describes observing a woman who is ostensibly doing just that. The poem ends with a paradigmatic Rilke image—in observing her impediments, he suddenly perceives a flash of transcendent elegance. Mitchell writes, “and yet: as though, once it was overcome, / she would be beyond all walking, and would fly.” Snow lowers the poetic register, writing, “and yet: as if, after a crossing over, / she would be done with walking, and would fly.” Mitchell’s hypothetical “as though,” draws the “o” sound through “once,” “overcome,” “would,” “beyond,” and “would,” all words connoting transcendence through the hypothetical. Snow’s most notable change is cooling Mitchell’s wider statement, “she would be beyond all walking,” into “she would be done with walking.” Snow also uses “as if,” instead of “as though,” whose “f” reappears in “fly,” which emphasizes the action within the hypothetical, as opposed to the hypothetical itself. In many ways the difference between the translations of these two lines embody the fundamental difference between Snow and Mitchell’s translations—Mitchell is concerned with the force of the imagination, of the dreamy feeling in Rilke, whereas Snow is concerned with the machinery, the functionality, of the content of his conditionals.
This attitude perhaps provides us with a clearer image of what Rilke is doing intellectually; however this often obscures the emotional force of Rilke’s poems. In the third poem of Rilke’s sonnet sequence, “Sonnets to Orpheus,” he addresses a youth, a “Jüngling,” who presumably has been writing bad love poems. Here is Snow’s translation: “It’s [i]not[/i], youth, when you’re in love, even / if then your voice forces open your mouth; — // learn to forget those songs. They elapse.” Though Snow preserves much of the syntax in Rilke’s original, there seems something diluted about the lines. Somehow the causal relation between the “voice” and the “mouth” is only weakly strung together by the pale “forces.” Compare these lines with the Mitchell: “…Young man, / it is not your loving, even if your mouth / was forced wide open by your own voice—learn // to forget that passionate music. It will end.” Though Mitchell changes the syntax considerably, the line breaks and enjambments are absolutely breathtaking. Where Snow maintains that the voice opens the mouth Mitchell has the mouth open first, then the line break, thereafter the cause is discerned. The Mitchell is exhilarating; we empathize for a moment with the Jüngling, we understand this overwhelming of sentiment, which makes the contraction of “it will end” (a much broader statement then “they end”) that much more moving in potency. It serves to note, additionally, that Mitchell maintains some semblance of rhyme in his translations, as strong as “how” and “Apollo” or as faint as “achieved” and “god.” Nevertheless, these pique our imaginations to the fact that these poems have a deep sonic lyrical quality embedded into them. Snow eschews rhyme, focusing on clarity and accuracy.
Ultimately, the Snow translation is no Mitchell. Mitchell provided us with a Rilke that far surpassed anything that came before it. Snow, although inferior to Mitchell, has nevertheless crafted a body of translations that, had Mitchell not already done so, would have easily become “the” way to read Rilke in English.
In judging various translations, we as readers are put in unique positions of judging, and experiencing, different versions of the same poem. All poets offer truths that are pressing and immediate, and yet often our immediate understanding of poetry happens only when the poem’s aesthetic affects us in a certain way. So, assuming translations maintain a reasonable accuracy, it really is a matter of personal preference which translation you choose. For me, Mitchell did the job. However, I believe Snow has put together a translation that will present the ideas and emotions embedded in Rilke’s poems equally enjoyable to others.

“In general it is a matter of experimenting with the different arrangements of one color,” Debussy wrote in 1894 concerning the composition of his three “nocturnes,” “which, in painting, for example, would be a study in grey.” Debussy’s vision of grey is not flat or dull; instead, it is a tone that remains mysterious, though it partially reveals itself in beautiful and distinct flashes. In the same manner, this delicate nuance of a singular emotional mode underlies Kazuo Ishiguro’s first collection of stories, itself entitled “Nocturnes.” But in lieu of Debussy’s tonal complexity or depth, Ishiguro’s collection merely evokes a neatly executed cadenza, which, though brilliant, only skims the surface of its characters’ emotional lives.
In “Nocturnes,” Ishiguro examines that dreaded moment in which people arrive at middle age and have to confront their mediocrity. Characters drift apart as they realize that they have not fulfilled their individual ambitions: the marriage between trophy wife Lindy Gardner and her fading American crooner husband unravels; the apprenticeship of a young Russian cellist under a woman who professes to be an accomplished musician dissolves; a struggling jazz musician, seeking notoriety, undergoes an unnecessary facelift and befriends Gardner while recovering from his surgery in a futile attempt to achieve celebrity.
It is significant that this is Ishiguro’s first collection of short stories. He is known for novels that chronicle the internal lives of their protagonists, allowing the narrators to reveal themselves to the audience. He notably employed this technique in “Remains of the Day,” which won him the Man Booker Prize in 1989. In that novel, the main character conceals as much of his psyche as he reveals, leading to a gradual but profound understanding of his life. Ishiguro depicts the characters that form “Nocturnes” in a similar way; he uses the first person throughout. But perhaps because of the constraints of short form fiction, he doesn’t allow his character to undergo a full emotional unfolding.
Nonetheless, Ishiguro remains a master at sketching out environments and characters through minimal, precise language. The struggling songwriter manages to conjure a grimy, lethargic music scene with characteristically British wit: “But the majority of auditions happened at a much more shambolic level. In fact, when you saw the way most bands went about things, it was no mystery why the whole scene in London was dying on its feet.” In the same way, the American jazz musician who befriends Gardner, has a completely different syntax that instantly identifies him as a member of the L.A. music scene: “If it’s pop they want, it’s pop I play. R&B? Fine. Car commercials, the walk-on theme for a talk show, I’ll do it. I’m a jazz player only when I’m inside my cubicle.” Ishiguro’s on-the-spot prose makes for a delicious reading experience, but it functions better as a placeholder for the characters’ context than as a vehicle for their development.
As the characters come to recognize that they must be content with their failures, they cope in frustratingly deadpan ways, lending the narrative a puzzling emotional flatness. Tony Gardner explains the seemingly tragic dissolution of his marriage to Lindy in sterile, practical terms, saying, “I’m no longer a major name. Now I could just accept that and fade away. Live on past glories. Or I could say, no, I’m not finished yet.… You have to be prepared to make a lot of changes, some of them hard ones. You change the way you are. You even change some things you love.” It is frustrating to watch Ishiguro’s characters push away their small share of contentment or achievement—the one saving grace against the mediocrity of middle age—in such a mundane and illogical manner. This makes up the simultaneously brilliant and irritating quality of Ishiguro’s work; his characters may not delve deeply into their inner emotional complexities, but they are true to their real life counterparts, who often similarly cope with loss and failure in utterly banal ways.
While Ishiguro’s depiction of the confrontation with failure appears wanting, his examination of protective psychological mechanisms remains one of the strongest points of the collection, underscoring both life’s pathos and surrealism. Ishiguro examines the absurdity of how humans protect themselves from the outside world and the moment in which this protection begins to wear down. Eloise McCormack, the self-professed virtuoso cellist who coaches young Tibor on his technique, eventually confesses that she cannot play the cello. She justifies this by claiming that other, less-gifted teachers would have destroyed her innate gift if she had taken lessons with them: “I knew I had to protect my gift against people who, however well-intentioned they were, could completely destroy it.” Yet this confession diminishes her into a pathetic figure leading a stunted musical life because of her own absurd desire for protection.
A scene that recasts this moment of blind, frozen protection in a hilariously surreal mode occurs when Steve and Lindy become friends after their plastic surgeries and wander around the surgeon’s building complex at night. At one point, they find themselves on the stage of a convention room by the catering table, when one of the organizers opens the curtains and comments, “It’s a man. With a bandaged head, wearing a night-gown. That’s all it is, I see it now. It’s just that he’s got a chicken or something on the end of his arm.” This seems to be Ishiguro’s conceptualization of the human protective mechanism: the bizarrely funny and nonsensical vision of two people with mummified heads standing on a stage, subjected to the fierce currents of the outside world while barely reacting to them.
Ishiguro’s short stories are well-executed, witty, and will not fail to disappoint his past readers. However, the stories still feel more like the technical toying of a master musician than a lyrical melodic narrative. Unlike Debussy’s carefully nuanced grey that covers the whole of the emotional spectrum, Ishiguro’s “Nocturnes” are filled with the grey of blanketed emotion. Shimmering scenes occasionally rise up out of the narrative, only to be dragged back into the monotony of ordinary life.

It’s an almost hallucinatory sense of confusion that pervades Lars Von Trier’s latest feature, the dubiously titled “Antichrist,” in its viewing experience as in its very composition. Already infamous for its disastrous reception at this summer’s Cannes Film Festival, the film seemed destined for a sort of immortality even before it hit worldwide release this month: the immortality of perpetual debate. Outrage circulated over controversy-stoking scenes of castration and genital self-mutilation, misogynist diatribe, and stultifying psychoanalytic pedantry. Hilarity abounded over a woodland fox that inexplicably speaks.
To be sure, “Antichrist” is rife with all of these things. Just as sure, the film never provides—nor so much as even suggests—a measure of forward-motion that would constitute a remotely critical synthesis for all the bizarre, absurd, or utterly inane things that manage to find their way into the 100 minutes that comprise it. Instead, Von Trier seems satisfied with a set of auteuristic half-measures intended to flummox or thwart critical impingement. When Willem Dafoe’s unnamed therapist-husband character exclaims toward the end of his wife’s treatment, “You don’t have to understand me, just trust me!” it may as well be Von Trier’s claim for the entire film. But the gesture backfires, and instead of the subject of endless discussion that it aspires to be, “Antichrist” is merely an entertaining, if catastrophically ham-fisted horror film.
The ostensible plot is ripped right out of the J-horror handbook: a young married couple travel to an isolated woodland retreat to deal with the grief following their toddler son’s death. In the film’s highly-stylized prologue, the black and white, slow-motion sequence of Dafoe and his wife, played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, making intense and explicit love is intercut with their son wandering into the room, witnessing their coitus, climbing out an open window, and falling. The image of the child falling in the snow-filled sky to the sound of Händel’s “Rinaldo” is just one of the scenes that impress—if only in passing—in “Antichrist,” and builds credit for the film to develop, if nothing else. But this image of a child falling in space, evocative of the fertile—however unambitious—dynamic of existential dread, is not the one Von Trier adopts for the propulsive force at the heart of the film. Instead, it is the satisfied, almost sly look that the child gives the camera as he turns from the scene of his parents—Freud’s “primal scene”—that remains the only concept throughout all of “Antichrist” that stands, free of contradiction, parody, or comment.
From here, Von Trier fashions a conceit from the juxtaposition of modern psychotherapy and bald psychoanalytic symbols. The couple’s respective reactions to grief—Dafoe’s intellectual distance manifest in his treatment of Gainsbourg, whose psychic pain becomes physical—exaggerate at a rate that reaches the suspenseful around the second act, and plows right through to the comically ridiculous by the third. Gainsbourg’s agonizing depression, it seems, is demonic rather than psychological—the wolf whose psychiatric sheep’s clothing leads Dafoe’s analyst (equipped with hypnosis, trust exercises, and thought-pyramids) into the heart of a forest subtly titled Eden. In nature, “Satan’s Church” as she calls it, the world is destroying itself and shows no mean intention of destroying them in the process. A dead calf swings from a fawn’s hindquarters; a baby bird is swarmed by ants and devoured by a hawk. It’s enough to believe that Von Trier is playing an enormous joke on his audience when Gainsbourg remarks grinningly to her husband, “Dreams are of no interest to modern psychology. Freud is dead, isn’t he?” A half hour of ejaculated blood and severed female anatomy later, “Antichrist” has done as much as show that if Freud isn’t dead, he’s certainly fair game for some extreme and rather thickheaded interpretations.
The first half of the film is essentially a horror film’s buildup toward dramatic tension, and it’s done effectively: eerily lit time-lapse nature footage punctuated by waves of white noise and color-saturated, slow-motion shots create a nightmarish atmosphere for the carnage to unfold in. The alternation between handheld and dollied camera is seamless, and Von Trier even experiments with lenses in the former case, making for an especially distorted register in some of the film’s most intense moments. But finding the natural extreme of a career that counts a visually stirring and intellectually stunted film like 1991’s “Europa” as its peak leaves “Antichrist” on the level of an aesthetically-conscious “Evil Dead.” The second half is a mixture of out-loud laughable dialogue and uncomfortable gore (an exceptional combination of the two, when the talking fox devours its own entrails) that, however unintentionally, makes for terrific popcorn-viewing.
So what begins as confusion wavers and then diminishes into the reality: “Antichrist” is an embarrassment audacious enough to reassure only a man like Lars Von Trier. A self-styled radical better known for narrative transgression and the outmoded Dogme 95 manifesto than any one particular film, Von Trier reveals himself finally and totally in “Antichrist” as the spoiled child of the art house: an auteur who insists that his films merely stand as pieces around which he himself can be discussed. In so blatantly passing off exploitation as art, the lesson that “Antichrist” teaches filmmakers is that bombastic garbage is still garbage.

Like any good cult action flick worth its weight in fake blood and heavy artillery, director Troy Duffy’s 1999 film “The Boondock Saints” was skewered by critics and largely ignored by audiences upon release. Written as a knee-jerk reaction to the crime and moral depravity unfolding just beyond Duffy’s front door, his cinematic ode to vigilante justice took years to garner a solid following. Slowly seeping into the lexicon of frat houses across the nation via limited re-releases and DVD distribution, the bullet-riddled spiritual journey of the MacManus twins eventually drummed up a large enough fan base to warrant the production of “The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day,” an equally entertaining—if not particularly inventive—second installment of the Bostonian retributive crime saga.
The explosive final scenes of “The Boondock Saints” witness twins Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus), joined by their father, Noah “Il Duce” MacManus (Billy Connolly), proclaiming their vigilante mission to the masses—just before spilling the blood of smug Italian mob boss “Papa” Joe Yakavetta in front of a crowded courtroom. “All Saints Day” reveals that the family has since been leading a rather idyllic life in their native Ireland. But as Il Duce says, “peace... is the enemy of memory,” and the twins—sporting a pair of hilariously rugged beards—seem ready to return to a less sedentary lifestyle. They receive their calling when they learn that someone is attempting to frame them for the grisly murder of a well-loved Boston priest, and the boys seize this opportunity to set sail for their former city, avenge the innocent priest’s death, and unleash a second onslaught on the Yakavetta crime family.
Unlike their first foray into vengeance killings, however, Connor and Murphy enjoy the luxury of local celebrity in “All Saints Day,” allowing them to pick off their targets with unusual ease. As a result, the plot manages to coast along with nary a conflict. En route to the states, they encounter Romeo (Clifton Collins, Jr.), a raucous co-worker with loose ties to the underworld, who risks life and limb to join the Saints crew, perhaps intuiting the sidekick position left vacant by Rocco’s death in the first film. Stateside, the Saints’ fame precedes them, and they are immediately offered a secret hideout and new weapons for free.
Most importantly, however, the MacManuses enjoy the unspoken support of the Boston Police Department, which falls all over itself to keep them safe and out of jail as the body count rises. Taking the place of morally conflicted FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is his protegé Eunice Bloom (Julie Benz), a sassy southerner who stalks the city in Christian Louboutin stilettos and keeps her gun in a leather holster draped about her svelte waistline. Sharing her mentor’s clairvoyant crime detection abilities, she manages to simultaneously anger and entice her male coworkers while conjuring up nearly flawless crime scene assessments, recreating Dafoe’s investigative astral projection scenes from the first “Boondock Saints.” Benz—notable for her role in the 2008 remake of another cult classic, “Rambo”—gracefully mimes the seedy ballet of underworld gun fights, ducking imaginary bullets while cooing hypotheses to her flabbergasted colleagues.
Left with an absurd amount of plot leeway, “All Saints Day” busies itself engaging in a self-referential elevation of campiness. While a great deal of the humor in the original hinged upon the brothers’ bungled attempts to recreate old action movie scenes, “All Saints Day” makes a conscious attempt to churn out fantastically outlandish fight scenes and hard-boiled, quotable one-liners. Murphy kicks off a killing campaign by cheekily remarking to his brother, “Let’s do some gratuitous violence.” Later, Romeo even threatens to physically harm a hostage if he doesn’t help him come up with a punchy zinger to shout gloatingly after taking out a group of mobsters.
The rabid fan base of “The Boondock Saints” was certainly instrumental in securing the funds necessary to churn out the second installment of Duffy’s crime narrative, and he has acknowledged that the audience’s rabid anticipation and high expectations exerted considerable influence over the making of “All Saints Day.” “There was fear on set. It was almost palpable,” Duffy said, describing the filmmaking process. “Nobody wanted to be the guy that screwed up ‘Boondock Saints’ in any way.” While “All Saints Day” does nothing to mar the original, it does little to distinguish itself from it. Rife with humorous references to the 1999 film, it tends to recycle plot in favor of creating well-choreographed shoot-outs with slick dialogue. Still, Duffy’s greatest fears have not been actualized, as the second round of his Catholicized bloodbath is just as much fun as the first. It just might take a while for everyone else to realize it.

Have you heard of “The Boondock Saints”? Two Irish brothers enter a room full of Italian (or Russian) mobsters. Gothic techno plays in the background. In beautiful synchrony, the brothers shoot everyone and then place coins in the eyes of the dead. They cross themselves and say a prayer, bidding the soul of the dead a swift departure to their hellish punishment. And then they crack a joke and revel in how easy it all is—how fucking cool killing people can be.
If that story isn’t familiar, it might be because the movie came into the world—despite its copious number of gunshots—with a whisper. Opening in theaters right after Columbine, national anti-violent sentiment, combined with poor critical response, led to the shoot ’em up’s release being curtailed to a 1-week stay at only a handful of theaters; essentially, it went straight to video. Since then, however, it has acquired a bit of a cult, assaulting the hearts of adolescent boys and men across America. The film’s director, Troy Duffy, emphasized this in a recent interview. “Half of [the success of] ‘Boondock’ was one guy sitting the other guy down and saying ‘you gotta watch this.’”
Testament to the ardor of its fans and of the creative team behind it, the story is to be reiterated in wide release in a sequel, “The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day,” which opens today—fittingly, the weekend of All Saints Day.
The first film left off with the brothers, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus), aided by their fresh-from-prison father (Billy Connolly), and a slick, sharp-tongued FBI agent, Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe), killing off the head of the Yakavetta crime family in a courtroom. Though they lost their buddy Roc (David Della Rocca), a bumbling, Mafia delivery boy, in the process, they seemed well on their way to completing their mission of eliminating Boston’s “scum”: mobsters, pimps, drug dealers, in short, anyone who offends their sense of right. “All Saints Day” sees the brothers lured back to Boston from their Irish refuge by killings copycatting their coins-in-the-eyes trademark. Once again they find themselves embroiled in the Boston underworld, with no choice but to gleefully resume (stylishly) shooting up the city.
The city of Boston has a prominent role in the films. Duffy credits his roots with suffusing the film with a Bostonian aura that has attracted its fair share of New England fans. “This is where I’m from,” he said. “I’m a New Englander. I was trying to bring a Bostonian mentality.”
Though part of the film was shot in Toronto, Duffy believes that the onsite filming in Boston was essential. “Quincy Market, Fanueil Hall, you can’t fake that shit,” he declared. “As far as I’m concerned, fuck everywhere else.”
Yet the film doesn’t just appeal to Bostonians, but to audiences throughout the United Sates. Flanery is quick to explain the film’s appeal: it’s all about brotherhood. “Your best friend, when he gets in a fight, you just jump in, ‘You just hit my buddy!’ That is something everyone can relate to,” he says.
Duffy insists about the film is not about “unrequited homoeroticism” despite the amount of attention the camera lavishes on his actors’ muscular torsos.
The same fraternal dynamic rules the exchanges between the leading men and their director. During the interview, they were completely doubled over in laughter, ridiculing each other (“Your faggotry overwhelms me”) and trading inside-jokes (“Homoquizzical, you flaming homosensual”). Lighthearted if nonsensical banter predominated, as Flanery poked fun at Reedus, “I hear the Saints showed up and one of them wreaks havoc and the other one is a queer.”
But when the cameras were rolling, the cast claims they grew serious. “Everyone seemed to be there for love of the piece,” said Connolly, a veteran actor of 55 films, citing numerous extras who showed up to take part in the film, both in Toronto and Boston. The other actors confirmed their commitment to the project, which looks likely to encompass a third installment.
It surely is the wish of the director, who though he has been working on many other scripts, remains resolute in his affection for the “Boondock” franchise. He jokes of being ready for something else (“I got some ideas. I’d like to do some gratuitous sex movies now that we’ve plowed [gratuitous violence] into the ground”), but his first loyalty is to the MacManus twins.
“I’d like to make ‘Boondock’ for the rest of my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “Saw” franchise has chewed through writers, directors, characters, and plot devices with the inhuman precision of one of John Kramer’s grisly traps. The formula is so powerful (read: profitable) that it exists outside any single creative mind; it is clearly a product of a studio, rather than an author. The latest installment shows that while “Saw’s” appetite for mutilation and dismemberment is unlimited, its supply of original material is not.
Of course, it’s too easy to simply complain that the franchise has run out of ideas: this happened millions of dollars (and gallons of fake blood) before “Saw VI,” and cinematic originality has never been “Saw’s” strong point. The appeal, of course, is the blood and gore, and “Saw VI” delivers exactly what audiences have come to expect. Writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, also responsible for “Saw IV” and “Saw V,” essentially re-combine the elements of earlier films into various permutations: “Let’s cut off someone’s hands and feet... with bombs!” or, my personal favorite, “Let’s cut someone in half... with acid!”. Standard “Saw” tropes like head-mounted traps, automated shotguns, self amputation, and smashing extremities to escape bondage make up the bulk of the film, while the few original elements (such as a maze filled with hot steam) are the least interesting of the mutilation machines. But this indirect borrowing from previous films apparently wasn’t enough to fill out “Saw VI’s” 90 minutes, so Melton and Dunstan resort to direct copying: much of the movie is comprised of endless flashbacks from earlier installments.
If there was any subtlety in the director’s cut, it has been removed. With profit-minded executives wielding the razor, narrative developments have been cut down to terse, perfunctory, and hilariously blunt lines. The implication of every plot twist is quickly and explicitly summarized for the audience’s benefit before the film rushes on to the next bloodbath. When Agent Hoffman, Jigsaw’s protege, [SPOILER OR NO?] goes to the audio lab responsible for decrypting a recording which will ultimately incriminate him, the lab technician delivers the following description of un-scrambling audio over a close-up of Hoffman’s face: “We’ll turn his algorithm upside-down and hear what he sounds like.”
The characters are similarly one-dimensional, with no motivations or desires other than those necessary to keep the film moving: detectives want to solve the case, psychopaths want to kill, and greedy executives (both those within the film and the real executives responsible for its creation) want to make money. The exception is Kramer [an executive?], whose predictable philosophy of appreciation of life receives almost all of the screen time not devoted to torture. Conveniently, his character provides an excuse for the flatness of those of his proteges, whose actions are motivated only by the fascism of Kramer’s master plan. [huh?]
In this way, the film gets us from trap A to trap B without creating an attachment to the characters or even the plot. Much like pornography, “Saw” uses laughably transparent devices to bring us what we want with a minimum of effort. Of course, plot is not the only point of resemblance to porn: poorly-airbrushed characters, ignorable dialogue, and extended penetration close-ups abound in this film.
Gore-porn, like sex-porn, follows a strict set of rules: it will present the explicit content we desire, but in a codified format which neutralizes any emotional attachment or psychological impact. Just as pornography’s implicit prohibition of kissing allows us to experience exploitative sex without any discomfort, so does gore-porn’s implicit prohibition of relatable characters and substantial plots allow us to experience unthinkable brutality with utmost detachment.
As evidenced by the massive profitability of “Saw” and other types of pornography, this formula is wildly successful. In this sense, “Saw VI” is a masterpiece: an efficient, polished, and profitable product of the Hollywood studio system. It is a perfectly consumable serving of violence, and its merits in this regard are undeniable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t want to like “Glee.” It first entered my consciousness last May when a friend told me about the cast’s cutesy version of “Don’t Stop Believing.” Um, what? You do not cover in your series premiere a song featured prominently in “The Sopranos” series finale. What kind of young TV upstart would dare take on that legacy?
The Journey cover topped the iTunes charts, and it would’ve made Tony’s Uncle Junior puke all over his gabagool. I watched five minutes of the first episode and decided that “Glee” was inane, idiotic, insipid, and many other angry adjectives. And the worst part? I really, really liked it.
Ryan Murphy, executive producer of “Glee,” told Variety that he was the lead in every one of his own high school musicals. I’m not surprised. “Glee” revels in its lameness, much like the socially-marginalized students that are its focus. To enjoy “Glee,” we must embrace our inner dork.
“Glee” is a musical dramedy that follows an embattled glee club at a high school in Lima, Ohio. In the midst of each episode’s quirky, maudlin plot points, the main ensemble cast of 12 performs upwards of five elaborately choreographed songs.
The show has undeniable street cred, even if that street is Broadway. The L.A. Times reported that Murphy shunned traditional pilot casting meat markets to spend three months scouting for talent on New York stages. Matthew Morrison, who plays the excruciatingly sincere glee club director Will Schuester, is known for his Tony-nominated performance in “The Light in the Piazza.” Lea Michele (dorky diva Rachel Berry) originated the role of Wendla in the musical “Spring Awakening.” And “Glee” has already enjoyed semi-explicable cameos by Broadway stars like John Lloyd Young of “Jersey Boys” and the effervescent Kristin Chenoweth.
It seems that “Gleeks”—the all-too-appropriate nickname for the show’s fans—are all around us. Joss Whedon, beloved creator of “Firefly” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” has signed on to direct an episode. Musicians like Billy Joel and Rihanna have offered to lower the licensing rates for the use of their songs on the show. According to “Entertainment Weekly,” we can expect an episode exclusively featuring the music of Madonna next year. The cast will sing the national anthem at Game 3 of the World Series and an off-season concert tour is already in the works.
But, musical talent aside, “Glee” hits plenty of wrong notes. The machinations of the popular kids are, at best, arbitrary; football players and cheerleaders quit and join glee club quickly enough to give you whiplash. Shop teachers and football coaches alike are miraculously revealed to be incredible singers and dancers, and new song arrangements are learned with telepathic speed. I’d call it “deus ex machina,” but there’s hardly any machina.
“Glee” has all the trappings of cheesy television—mismatched couples and star-crossed couples, a teen pregnancy and a fake pregnancy. Jessalyn Gilsig, best known for her role on “Heroes” as Claire’s unstable, alarming birth mother, is a little too overwhelming as Will’s unstable, alarming wife. But the show revels in its vapidity and mixes a healthy measure of arsenic in with the saccharine. As soon as you’re lulled into sleepy, bored complacency, you’ll be violently roused by snark.
That’s where the show’s greatest asset comes in: Jane Lynch as monomaniacal cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester, my favorite tracksuit-wearing TV character since Paulie Walnuts. You’ll recognize Lynch, one of the most underrated comic actresses of her time, from her genius turns in Christopher Guest movies or as super-creepy Paula in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.” Another highlight is Jayma Mays as Emma Pillsbury, the school’s winningly mysophobic guidance counselor.
Glee club, show choir, ostentatious singing and dancing for attention—whatever you want to call it, it’s a fundamentally frivolous endeavor. And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. If we think about the primetime television lineup in terms of high school stereotypes, “Glee” is exactly the kid it glorifies: eager to please and heartwarmingly dorky. I’m willing to forgive the show its plot holes and character inconsistencies, if only because it means well.

In 1915, when a team of archaeologists from Harvard and the Museum of Fine Arts cracked open a tomb in Deir-el-Bersha, Egypt, they found intricate coffins embedded within each other, 55 wooden boats—each distinctly crafted and painted—and beer. Lots of beer. Scattered in disarray throughout the grave were tiny beer jars representative of their larger, real counterparts, miniature models of breweries, and wooden slave figures with the drink balanced on their heads. Apparently, eternal thirst was not an attractive option for the Ancient Egyptians.
It certainly wasn’t for Djehutynakt (pronounced ‘Je-hooty-knocked’), the governor of Middle Kingdom Egypt whose luggage for the spiritual world is the focus of “The Secrets of Tomb 10a: Egypt 2000 BC,” on display at the MFA until May 16. With the contents of one particular grave, the show puts the viewer face-to-face (quite literally) with the Egyptians and their dead.
A full fleet of funerary boats, the symbolic transportation to the afterlife, appears in the exhibition. Each small vessel is about two feet long and carries something different: transport boats have portable cabins in which Djehutynakt could sit; on a fowling boat, one slave steers, while another throws out a net to catch marsh birds.
Nearby, painted wooden slaves work at routine tasks. There are also bakeries, granaries, and tables laden with food—Djehutynakt apparently spared no daily comforts when planning for the afterlife. The statues are rudimentary. The slaves walk with stiff, jointless limbs, and their figures seem to lurch rather than to move. Despite their rigidity, the figures exude a captivating energy. Several models show slaves feeding oxen, the prostrate beasts reaching their heads forward to the hands of the kneeling slaves. This is an aspect of Egyptian life not captured in the impersonal statues of kings.
Informative labels, peppered throughout the show, describe the particulars of Egyptian rituals and religion. Large, colorful boards explain the process of discovering, restoring, and understanding the objects that are displayed. They give the exhibition a scholarly tone and direct the viewer through the process of archaeology, rather than simply expose its results.
Mimicking the discovery, the exhibition moves from within the tomb to inside the coffin. The panels of the coffin are intricately painted with images for the afterlife. In a presentation scene, Djehutynakt sits before a crowd of gifts, including jars, birds with interlocking heads, gazelle-like creatures, and even an eviscerated ox. The painting is sophisticated—the governors’ legs are colored in two different shades of red to create foreground and background—and the detail is impressive.
Prayers and guides to the underworld cover the wood. One panel features Djehutynakt’s conversation with Ra during his passage through the underworld. Fragments of the hieroglyphs, translated for the viewer, suggest a vision of the afterlife that could rival Dante’s. “Dog-face, whose shape is big. This is a spell for passing by him,” one segment reads.
Finally, nestled in the center of the exhibition, is the ultimate encounter: the mummy itself. Only the head remains, a brown, distorted thing, its features drooping after chemical alterations and years underground. The process of mummification altered the face so much, a panel informs, that the priest in charge of preparing the body would recreate the face before burial. Today, the head looks more alien than human.
In their rush to loot the tomb, robbers severed the head from its body, and it is unknown today whether the head belonged to the governor or to his wife. But here again, the exhibition highlights archaeological advancement in relation to the object itself. A video explains how DNA testing is currently answering this century-old question.
The focus on archaeological process over product, and artifact over art, distinguishes “The Secrets of Tomb 10a” from many Egyptian exhibitions, where typically a hodgepodge of statues and jewelry leave the viewer awestruck, but distanced from the culture itself. Nothing from Tomb 10a is monumental; no one artwork stands out as particularly impressive. Tomb robbers, a panel informs early on, got to the grave before the archaeologists did, seizing everything perceived to have value: jewelry, ornaments, and large statues. But an inspection of what remains brings the viewer closer to the past and those who unearthed it.

For everyone who has eagerly awaited a Hogwarts acceptance letter since the summer of their 11th year, "Harry Potter: The Exhibition" is finally an opportunity for them to get a taste of the wizarding world. Like stepping from the streets of London into Knockturn Alley, the experience of entering "Harry Potter: The Exhibition" is one which makes the fantastical realm a reality for visitors. Showcasing the props and sets used in the Warner Brothers film series, "Harry Potter: The Exhibition" runs in the Museum of Science until February 21.
"The Museum is excited to offer its visitors the opportunity to immerse themselves in an exhibit that bridges both cultures and generations," said Ioannis Miaoulis, president and director of the Museum of Science, Boston, in a statement issued by the museum. According to Miaoulis, he hoped the exhibition would attract visitors of all ages, especially those who have not stepped foot in a science museum before. "It is our hope that the exhibit will lead visitors to experience the excitement of discovery that’s at the heart of all that we do at the Museum of Science," he said.
In "The Exhibition," museum-goers can first be sorted into one of the four Hogwarts Houses by the Sorting Hat. The oak doors that then lead into the rest of the exhibition open on a black room where scenes from the movies play in loop. Suddenly, a black screen rises, and Platform 9 3/4 appears, complete with a steaming red train engine and a waiting platform attendant carrying an old-fashioned lamp.
The exhibition itself, which occupies 10,000 square feet of the museum, reveals how obsessively intent on detail the films’ producers were when creating the movie series. From the Chudley Cannon posters in Ronald Weasley’s room to the descriptions in Professor Lockhart’s Defense Against the Dark Arts tests, it becomes apparent that Warner Brothers did not skimp when it came to character development.
With this exhibition, fans might find that they discover something new about their favorite characters, as there seems to be even more material here than can be found in the books. For example, who knew that Remus Lupin collected gramophone records? Or that the company that makes pumpkin juice was among the sponsors of the Wizarding World Cup? The attention paid to the props themselves, from Hermione’s Time-Turner to a Golden Snitch, reveals the artistry that went into making every element of the movies.
What is tiny on screen comes alive in this exhibition, and viewers will find themselves captivated by each of the carefully crafted props featured in this show. Objects such as issues of "The Daily Prophet" or Professor Umbridge’s Educational Decrees and Ministry of Magic memos do not receive more than a few seconds of screen time, but their authenticity is what allows film audiences to suspend their disbelief and fully embrace the world of Harry Potter, if just for the duration of a movie. This exhibition makes it clear that these details are the difference between watching a show about wizards and believing that magic is part and parcel of daily life.
Aside from these props are models of magical creatures, including centaurs, acromantulas, Hungarian Horntails, baby threstrals, and house elves, as well as the costumes worn by characters in the movies. Although the ceiling doesn’t change to mimic the weather outside in the Great Hall section of the exhibit, you do have the option of sitting in Hagrid’s oversized chair in the set of Hagrid’s hut.
In addition to adherence to the magical atmosphere created by the Harry Potter series, the exhibition also offers a number of interactive activities and games; instead of the usual basketballs and hoops, they involve Quaffles and rings.
"Harry Potter" may be an exhibition based on a popular childrens’ series, but like any successful show, it transports visitors—not back into time, in this case—but into its own separate world. What is appealing about this exhibition is that it, like any reconstruction of a different era or presentation of some scientific theory, is complete—the clothes, food, paintings, and other trappings of the Harry Potter universe seem pulled straight from the day-to-day life of an alternate, wizarding world. In making Harry Potter come alive, "Harry Potter: The Exhibition" is its own Mirror of Erised, fulfilling a dream for the most die-hard fans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every so often, when I am feeling plucky, I try to write a screenplay that combines all 10 of Americans’ top phobias and market it as a sleeper hit. The protagonist, an evil dentist (fear of dentists) lives in a tall building (acrophobia) with elevators (agoraphobia) that sometimes, for no reason, are full of spiders, snakes, and dogs (fear of spiders, snakes, and dogs). It is a dark (dark) and stormy (storms) night, and he has to get on an airplane (fear of airplanes). The horrifying twist at the end of the film is that a randomly selected audience member has to stand up and give a speech about it to the rest of the theater. It would become a horror classic. According to The Boston Globe, more people are frightened of public speaking than of drowning. I imagine that, rather than shouting things like “Help!” and “I’m drowning,” the especially timid prefer to quietly drown so as to avoid a fuss.
Statistically speaking, only about 19.2 million Americans have crippling fears of things, and our fears tend to be illogical—airplanes (1 out of 20,000 fatality rate) rather than cars (1 in 100); dentists rather than the apparently friendly people who tend to abduct our children.
But these inbred phobias can be powerful. Dating back into evolutionary time, they evoke an era when all we had to worry about were important things like wheels and fire and whether the attractive, brawny caveman in the neighboring cave should have called by now. Back then, people didn’t fear things like public speaking or getting into airplanes, primarily because there was no language and airplanes didn’t exist.
But evolution goes on, whether we want it to or not, bringing us the Snuggie and taking away our ability to solve all our problems with rocks. In the face of new technologies and new worries, even snakes seem somehow outmoded as objects of terror—a relic from an earlier evolutionary time. Forced to confront a reptile or an international financial crisis, I’ll take the reptile every time. These primal phobias are inadequate when you consider the real dangers we face.
So what about the things that really scare us?
The economy frightens a lot of people these days. For me, it tends to fall into the category of things that I fear because I do not fully understand them. I also fear the metric system of weights, and most women.
Once you start worrying, it’s hard to stop. What if I fail that test? What if that other test comes back positive? What if there is one right person out there for me but he lives in a populous urban area, carelessly wanders into the street, and gets hit by a truck? What if the world really will end in 2012 when the Mayans return? What if I do write the Great American Something, but then I keel over unexpectedly and no one can retrieve it from my hard drive? What if fashion changes drastically and forces me to wear leggings as pants? What if the fact that I didn’t enjoy “Where The Wild Things Are” means that I lack the capacity for love? What if something happens to Barack Obama? What if something happens to me before I can change my Facebook profile to reflect more accurately my current interests, things like “being employable”?
What if all the profound thoughts I’ve ever had are just things I misheard at introductory philosophy lectures?
Bad things happen, and you can only be so prepared. Someday, in a hostage situation, I might accidentally use a weird inflection that makes the hostage-taker think I’m casting aspersions on his cultural or socioeconomic background.
And then there are the insidious fears. Sometimes I worry that my friends don’t actually like me but have been pretending because someone is hiring them. Or that the old woman I thought was my benefactor is indifferent to my existence, and I’m actually receiving funds from a strange convict. (That’s the plot of “Great Expectations,” but it doesn’t stop me from worrying about it.)
Even success is frightening. I am terrified that someday I might be elected president of the United States and accidentally activate the nuclear-weapons system because I’ll be trying to talk and eat a bagel at the same time and my comment about the weather will sound like the code signal. Or that someday I will meet George Lucas, but that he won’t like me.
And then the barrage of what-ifs begins again. What if I find love? What if I don’t? What if I find Jesus? What if I don’t? What if I die alone? What if I die surrounded by people? Like a firing squad? What if I get fat? What if by the time I’m fat, it’s illegal, because of the new health-care system?
What if I’ve hurt someone? What if the world runs out of lions?
They say it’s healthier not to worry, to live each moment as it comes. What if worrying is putting me into an early grave? Can I worry about that?
Now I’m going to be awake all night. A simple “Boo!” would have sufficed.

At the height of the Gilded Age, the American sociologist Thorstein Veblen criticized the country for “conspicuous consumption”: the lavish and arbitrary spending on goods and service merely for the display of wealth.
Today, even in the midst of recession and what some would dub a second Gilded Age, we have our own arbitrary displays of wealth. But, more uniquely, our time in history is defined by “conspicuous compensation.” The amount that some people are paid—especially those who are paid with the country’s common cents—seems to lack all common sense.
Last Friday, the U.S. Treasury “pay czar” officially mandated pay cuts for the top 25 executives at seven firms that received bailout money—including Citigroup, AIG, and Bank of America. On top of that, the Federal Reserve has now put forth a proposal to have veto power over every bonus of every financial firm—even those who have not received Troubled Asset Relief Program money.
Unfortunately, the cuts will do little to nothing to address the source of our financial woes. It’s frustrating. Many are bloodthirsty, and having resorted to a tool that is so seemingly “un-American” as a pay cut, we might expect substantial change to come quickly. But, sadly, the cuts initiated by Special Master of Executive Compensation—and yes, that is his real title—Kenneth Feinberg are little more than a political palliative. In fact, at Citigroup last week, top officials assured worried executives and traders that “the net impact of Mr. Feinberg’s rulings will be minimal because the cut salary will be shifted from cash to longer-term stock grants.” In order to change the incentive structure that led to the financial crisis in the long run, there must be stronger, simpler institutional changes than indiscriminate executive pay cuts or even bonus regulation.
Nonetheless, the debate about pay cuts raises questions about whom we value in society as far as professions go. What, exactly, makes the top executives at Citigroup worth millions in the first place? And I’m not talking about executives who had a heavy hand in our collective downfall—I’m questioning the income finance executives in general. Often, the top 25 executives aren’t the ones who make or break a firm.
Most Americans have little connection to the titans of finance. They don’t provide many jobs to average Americans, they produce no new innovations of use to the ordinary American, and they work primarily for the benefit of a few individuals and their pensions.
The central issue is that executive compensation packages are not a product of market forces. There is no simple way to determine the value a single individual creates in a large financial firm. In fact, finance executives get generous compensation packages even when firms do poorly and workers are laid off. Performance and pay are not inextricably linked.
In truth, the top executives at many financial firms are paid much more than they should be and well beyond what reason dictates. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy in finance culture: The continually rising size of the compensation packages has led candidates for executive positions to expect big payments. It has led boards to fear the consequences of not fulfilling those expectations.
Many complain that the new government-mandated pay cuts will cause firms to lose top talent. But, right now, the seven bailed-out and cut firms are in the same boat as other companies: They’re not hiring.
Some contend that heavier regulation of the banking industry will cause a brain drain from finance. The best and brightest will depart for other professional fields. But as an American who grow up valuing people who contributed to the well-being of others, I have no problem with that. I respect my friends who work in finance and their life choices, but if future generations are more prone to go into engineering or medicine, then that’s all for the better. The banking image should be boring again.
At the end of the day, astonishingly high pay for finance executives speaks mountains on what America values—or at least what it deems allowable to be valuable. There was a time when there was a stigma around jobs that benefited only the wealthy. Now there’s a sense of approbation—especially among my generation.
I don’t think the administration should demonize Wall Street or the financial sector in general, but we need to seriously think about what we as a people value most. We could use a little more common sense in thinking about common cents.

MIT: President Obama visited our sister college down Mass. Ave. last week, giving a speech on clean energy and reminding Techies that Nobel Prizes do exist outside chemistry.
Spin: After this summer’s beer summit, Harvard held a 1-0 advantage in the category of “Professors Who Have Met The President.” Now that lead has vanished. MIT appears to be positioning itself to steal the title of World’s Greatest University—we must attack at once.
The Spee: This old boys’ club just got a little more elitist, adding new old boy Justin Timberlake to the fold. Timberlake’s latest movie, “The Social Network,” is paying the Spee handsomely for using it in the film.
Spin: It’s not as awesome as it seems. They’re only filming there because they thought it was the Phoenix.
Daylight Saving Time: What comes up must come down—this weekend, clocks fall back, and students fall back to sleep for one more hour.
Spin: Make sure you’re not that guy who forgets and shows up to lecture an hour early on Monday.
Purell: Remember when your stock consultant told you that investing in a clear, lube-like gel wouldn’t pan out? Well, look who’s laughing now—Purell’s stock rose 50 points this week on fears of swine flu.
Spin: Well, OK, this didn’t really happen, but it seems plausible, right?
Coffee: You’ll think twice now about that triple-mocha latte, ever since six Harvard graduate students were poisoned when sodium azide somehow got into their joe. Authorities suspect foul play, but no motives or suspects are immediately obvious.
Spin: Oh, how we long for the days when coffee just killed you by rotting out your teeth, introducing a powerful stimulant drug into your bloodstream, and feeding you carcinogenic sugar substitutes.
Mets fans: The New York Yankees are your crosstown rivals. The Philadelphia Phillies are the hated usurpers of the division that is rightfully yours. So of course those two teams are meeting up in the World Series.
Spin: Face it, guys. Someone up there hates you.
Tom Menino: The long-time mayor of Boston, seeking to be elected to an unprecedented fifth term next Tuesday, is under fire from his opponent for a “culture of corruption” in City Hall.
Spin: It doesn’t matter, though, because no one at Harvard is aware that there’s an election going on.
Swine Flu: New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report up to 5.7 million cases of swine flu in the nation this spring, with a significant number of them going undiagnosed.
Spin: All of them seem to be the kids in your section. Kleenex?

In the end, J-term housing wasn’t so difficult to obtain after all.
This past Monday, a mere 11 days after the application deadline, the College officially granted J-term housing to 1,316 out of the 1,404 undergraduates who applied—yielding a surprisingly high acceptance rate of 93 percent. Given the College’s ambiguous pre-deadline statements as to how many applicants it would allow to stay on campus and which student needs would actually translate into dormitory swipe access, the decision to permit almost all J-term applicants to stay at Harvard in January is both encouraging and commendable.
Originally, the administration had set a 1,000-person cap on the number of students who would be allowed to spend January in Harvard housing. We appreciate the flexibility of the College’s ultimate decision to admit more students who demonstrated legitimate needs (though the actual number on campus will never dramatically exceed 1,000 due to students’ different schedules). And, by any standard, the 93 percent of applicants accepted—which included students ranging from thesis writers to athletes to members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—is an impressive number to accommodate.
It is worth noting, however, that this high acceptance rate could have been even higher if the College allowed other students to stay on campus provided that they were willing to forgo a meal plan during their stay. These students would live in their houses and do their work like other J-term residents, but would eat elsewhere. Given the low cost of maintaining such meal-free roomers, we see no reason why these students could not also be allowed to spend at least a portion of January at Harvard.
But, overall, Monday’s results are excellent news, and we are pleased that the College, for the most part, recognized the wide array of reasons students have for remaining on campus during what would otherwise be an additional 20 days of vacation. But as this is the inaugural J-term—and these 1,316 students the first to be granted the privilege to remain on campus during that time—those in residence should behave responsibly so as not to ruin the chances of future applicants to receive housing during what, for many, is bound to be a crucial period for training, research, and intellectual activity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard may reorient its long-term fundraising strategy to focus more attention on unrestricted funds rather than earmarked gifts, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview last week, giving voice to a policy that has become increasingly important in the midst of the recent economic downturn.
Confronted with harsher financial realities over the past year, University officials repeatedly stressed the importance of raising flexible, current use funds in order to support key priorities, such as financial aid.
And in light of the positive donor response, Faust said that the University’s call for unrestricted giving may evolve into a permanent strategy.
“Harvard even in good times hasn’t put enough emphasis on unrestricted giving,” Faust said. “Our donors tended to want to endow particular activities—it’s just how the process was structured as it evolved.”
Unrestricted funds raised over the past year have been used to support various initiatives including classroom reconstruction at the Graduate School of Education, new scientific equipment for the Molecular Cellular Biology Department to further human genetics research, and financial aid at the Kennedy School.
The University’s chief fundraiser Tamara E. Rogers ’74 said yesterday that though Harvard had already begun focusing fundraising efforts on current use money before the recession, market pressures gave these concerted efforts “extra impetus” and direction, most notably in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
FAS posted a 38 percent increase in unrestricted gift receipts available for immediate use—from $24 million to $33 million—over the past fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.
In contrast, fundraising levels across the University fell by 8 percent over the last year, a result Rogers attributed to the global economic crisis and described as “inevitably disappointing, but not surprising.”
Rogers said that she believed Harvard’s donor base understands the importance of flexible funds to support “critical priorities,” thereby rendering such a strategy sustainable in the long run.
“Our donors are sophisticated philanthropists,” Rogers said.
But some alumni may harbor an inherent suspicion of supplementing a pool of unrestricted University money—a “slush fund,” as Mark A. Hissey ’84 called it in an interview this spring.
“They want their money to go to things that they really cared about,” Hissey said, defending donor prerogative in the allocation of funds, even in the context of a donor base that viewed Harvard as “very responsible” with its use of resources.
In addition, a strategy that emphasizes unrestricted gifts may not have staying power in the long-run, philanthropy expert Kathleen D. McCarthy said, given that soliciting unrestricted or current use funds tends to be more difficult when the urgency of raising money to maintain core activities dissipates.
“It might be a harder thing to pitch when the economy improves,” said McCarthy, director at the CUNY Center for the Study of Philanthropy. “In flush times, you’re going to have more people who want to leave their own personal stamp on the gift.”

Harvard Medical School debuted an H1N1 Influenza iPhone application this week as part the school’s new HMSMobile program, which provides rapid access to public health information through  mobile devices.
The application, which costs $1.99, allows users to watch informational videos about the virus, lists prevention techniques, and charts outbreaks.
“People want short answers to burning questions,” said Harvard Health Publications Editor-In-Chief Anthony L. Komaroff. “They don’t want to spend two hours reading about a disease that a doctor says they might have.”
But some Harvard undergraduates voiced skepticism about the potential popularity and utility of the program.
Matthew P. Cavedon ’11 said that he had not heard of the H1N1 application and could not see much use for it.
“I could understand if WebMD had a broad application based on health concerns,” he said. “But one just based on swine flu seems a little alarmist to me.” Komaroff dismissed criticisms that the H1N1 outbreak has been overblown in the media.
“I don’t agree with people who say the swine flu is a fraudulent creation of the pharmaceutical industry or academics,” he said. “That is absolute nonsense.”
Komaroff noted that H1N1 has killed 1,000 people in the U.S.
Harvard Undergraduate Health Services has diagnosed about 300 people, mainly undergraduates, with influenza-like illness since the end of August.
Though the information about H1N1 is available on the Internet, Komaroff emphasized that there may be times when people have questions about the virus when web access is unavailable.
“Questions about swine flu may come to you when you are in an airport, or in a cab, when your computer is in the trunk,” he said.
Komaroff said three or four physicians helped with the development of the content and about a half dozen artists and editors employed by Harvard Health Publications assisted with the project.
Komaroff could not comment on the amount of the Medical School’s investment in the project and said he does not know whether the application is projected to yield a profit.
“I know we haven’t had a return on the investment so far, but I wouldn’t have expected it in two days,” he said.

With just under six weeks remaining in the race to gain the Democratic nomination for the Senate seat vacated by the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-56, the two Harvard alumni in contention are facing large gaps in the polls, according to figures released last week by a Massachussetts-based polling institute.
Stephen G. Pagliuca, a 1982 graduate of Harvard Business School, and Alan A. Khazei ’83,  placed second and fourth in the poll released by the New England College Polling Institute in Springfield last Monday, which showed Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley leading the four-person field by a margin of 23 percent.
“We feel very good about where we are in the campaign,” said Alex Zaroulis, communications director of Coakley’s campaign, after the poll figures showed 37 percent of respondents throwing their support behind Coakley.
But Pagliuca, shown to have gained the support of 14 percent of poll respondents, said he was pleased with his position in the race. “We moved from nothing to second place in [a span of] three weeks,” he said when asked about his reaction to the recent poll.
“We’re going to keep talking about making Massachusetts a great place,” added Pagliuca, who has adopted a platform that emphasizes proposed health care and financial reforms.
The Khazei campaign, despite gaining the support of only four percent of respondents in the recent poll, which claimed an error margin of five percent, also expressed optimism yesterday about the former Currier House Committee chairman’s spot in the race. Citing the fact that 26 percent of individuals in the poll identified themselves as undecided, Dave Jacobson, the press liaison for the Khazei campaign, noted that “the only poll that matters is the poll on Election Day.”
Stating that Khazei supporters represent “a large grassroots movement that is building [momentum] every single day,” Jacobson said that the campaign will put further emphasis on a strong advertising push occurring online and over the airwaves. Volunteers will also participate in a statewide canvas for Khazei this weekend.
Mass. Congressman Michael E. Capuano, who had garnered 13 percent of the state’s support according to the poll, could not be reached for comment yesterday.
The election to decide the Democratic nomination is currently slated to take place on December 8, after which candidates will have six weeks to prepare for the general election on January 19.
“We need to focus on getting [our] message out to voters and keep working hard all the way until December 8,” said Coakley Communications Director Zaroulis.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School has a history of acrimonious relationships with its administrators, but when Martha Minow was appointed dean this summer the chatter in the faculty canteen was overwhelmingly positive.
“In terms of reactions this was pretty good,” said former Dean Robert C. Clark. “When Dean [Elena] Kagan was appointed there was some griping among the faculty that never got in the press, and certainly when I got appointed there were wild denunciations.”
It’s hardly surprising—Martha Minow has a warm reputation and a smile that comes easily, an endearing quality for one of Harvard’s most prolific legal scholars.
In Cambridge, she’s served for years on the appointments committee that helped poach some of this nation’s most prestigious legal scholars, including Cass Sunstein and Laurence Lessig. She chaired Kagan’s curriculum reform committee that revamped the school’s curriculum. And through all this work, she has shied away from the spotlight.
But in July, at the close of a secretive search process, Minow shed her usual behind the scenes role to succeed Kagan as Dean of the Law School.
Minow steps into the shoes of the most popular Harvard Law School Dean in recent memory. Her predecessor Elena Kagan has been credited with vastly expanding the faculty, presiding over a period of wildly successful fundraising, and healing rifts among faculty after decades of ideological conflict at the school.
“Her shoes are bigger than mine—and she wears heels,” Minow quipped.
But Kagan benefited from an environment far removed from today’s climate of precipitous endowment losses and spending curtailment. Minow faces the unenviable task of reconciling shrinking spending with a period of rapid, immense change in the legal industry that has altered the way law schools operate. As a result, some fear that as the school shrinks its budget, spectres of the school’s ideological battles of the past might resurface.
CHANGING LANDSCAPE
Minow says it was the idea of justice that first drew her to legal scholarship.
“I came to law school because I care about justice,” Minow said. “The question of justice should be present in the classroom, present in the work of scholars, present in the career aspirations. What justice is, of course, is a very complicated matter.”
It’s a passion colleagues like Kennedy School Professor Mary Jo Bane single out as one of Minow’s central qualities.
“I know that she is committed to a culture of public service and a culture of advancing justice,” said Bane, who spoke with Minow shortly before she assumed the Deanship. “I remember that she said, ‘What I really care about is justice, and what a law school ought to be about is justice—and I want to bring the Law School together around that.”
But in the wake of the financial crisis and the subsequent recession, practical pressures once foreign to the school have pushed their way to the fore.
The large firms that traditionally employ scores of Harvard Law graduates have been particularly hard hit by the recession, prompting growing unease among students and administrators.
And as recruiters have dwindled on campus, some students have even had difficulty finding jobs, something previously unheard of at the Law School.
“This is obviously a turbulent time for legal markets across the board from large multinational law firms to public interest jobs, and also government jobs,” Minow said.
As a result a movement has emerged at Harvard to reform the legal services industry at nearly every level—from the way associates are recruited to the way law firms bill and interact with their clients.
For the Law School, that could mean radical changes to the recruiting process, with some proposing a system that would match students and firms by evaluating both of their preferences.
Minow declined to take a position on the reform movement but emphasized the work of a committee headed by Law School Professor David B. Wilkins ’77, which is tasked with considering reform proposals and producing a report on their findings. In conjunction with those conclusions, Minow said, Harvard Law will “take a leadership role in the profession.”
A CONFLICTED HISTORY
In the midst of Harvard Law School’s darkest days, then-Dean Robert C. Clark used to regularly pace the school’s corridors to rally his faculty around controversial decisions, a lobbying effort driven by intense ideological and methodological divides at the School.
For years, the Law School had been known as “Beirut on the Charles,” a moniker referring to the vicious academic infighting that made many liken its acrimonious atmosphere to the brutal civil war in Lebanon.
So after faculty hiring meetings Clark would walk around the school meeting with faculty to build support for and acquiesce to hiring decisions.
“My problem was a faculty at war and hostile alumni,” Clark said.
During the worst periods of tension at the Law School, faculty refused to approve hiring decisions because they feared that allowing the school to hire someone with an opposing methodology or ideology would limit opportunities to hire academics with their own outlook. This log-jam resulted in a shrinking faculty at one point in the school’s history.
Clark began a period of faculty growth but contended with ideological and methodological divides that permeated the school throughout his tenure.
With the rapid expansion of the faculty under Kagan’s tenure some of these barriers began to disappear. As the number of appointments increased, faculty no longer feared that positions would not be available for professors with similar methodologies and ideologies.
“When the opportunity to make appointments is scarce, then members with strong ideological commitments are likely to think that with every appointment we make who doesn’t employ my preferred methodology I’m afraid that it will be at the expense of someone who practices my methodology,” said Professor Richard H. Fallon.
But rapid growth cannot be sustained forever, and with budgetary concerns weighing heavily on administrative decisions, Law School officials have said that the faculty expansion under Kagan has to end.
With the decrease in hiring comes the fear that rancor might return to the North Yard.
“We had an appointments logjam prior to Kagan,” Fallon said. “We will not be able to make as many appointments, and there may be some fear of sliding back into logjam.”
Minow—who said the Law School will likely appoint between two and 8 positions—downplayed the likelihood that tension over faculty appointments will return and said that the methodological battles of the 80s are a thing of the past.
“It’s not the nature of our current conversation,” Minow said.
But concern among the faculty remains.
“I think seeing how the faculty deals with a world with fewer appointments will be an important issue,” said Mark V. Tushnet ’67, a Law School professor and member of the appointments committee. “That’s not saying that it’s going to be an issue, but it’s an issue that will be evidently different.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Queen’s Head was full last night as 70 Harvard beer connoisseurs—more than ever before—attended the latest installment of the pub’s Beer School series, which featured four new Sam Adams beers.
Normally, the event, which began in the spring of 2007 and invites American beer companies to showcase their newest brews, draws about 50 undergraduate and graduate students, said Tom Southworth, director of ordering and selecting beers for the pub.
Some attendees said that they had previously attended sessions.  Peter C. Mulcahy ’07, a former Crimson editor, who said he had attended the last beer school featuring Sam Adams, attributed the increase in attendance to a heightened appreciation and enthusiasm for Sam Adams beer, one of America’s most popular beer companies.
Mike Piontek, a sales representative of Boston Brewing Company, which brews Sam Adams, said he thinks the state of the economy has contributed to the success his company’s beer has seen recently.
“People are increasingly etching away from expensive wines. They prefer to buy a six or 12 pack of quality beer,” he said.
Harvard has several connections to brewing. C. James Koch ’78, founder of Boston Beer Company, is a graduate of both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School.
In addition, the building that houses the Center for European Studies at Harvard is named Busch Hall, after the Busch beer brewing family, Mulcahy said. The founders of rival American brewing company Harpoon Brewery were also both graduates of Harvard.
“There’s definitely a tradition of beer at Harvard,” Mulcahy said, “and it’s really neat to see.”
The organizers matched each brew with a unique food item. Sam Adams Boston Lager was paired with fried calamari, while the Coastal Wheat brew was paired with lemon humus and Swiss cheese.
The night ended with a raffle giveaway of pint glasses and Sam Adams fleeces.
Southworth believes that despite the casual and entertaining atmosphere of the event, the Beer School serves a greater purpose.
“It’s a great way to learn about the intricacies of different beers. Even those familiar with beer learn about the minutia behind brewing,” he said.

CORRECTION APPENDED
A panel of experts came together yesterday at the Harvard Law School to discuss concerns of racial profiling by America’s police force that were prompted by this summer’s arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and the controversy it sparked.
The discussion—which included professors, police chiefs, and students—provided further insight into the Gates incident and recognized that the topic of race relations in America is still a pressing issue.
“When I walk into a store and the clerk has been rude to me, I think in my mind is he just being a jerk to be a jerk, or is he being a jerk because of my race?” said Oakland police chief Anthony W. Batts, who is African American.
Professor Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.—director of the Law School’s Criminal Justice Institute—said he saw an important yet disconcerting lesson in civics brought forward by the Gates incident. He said that he wanted to raise the question of whether African Americans could fully exercise their rights in the same way as whites without fearing arrest.
“You can speak sharply to the police. You have that constitutional right,” said Sullivan. “Is it prudent? Probably not.”
Professor Christopher E. Stone of the Kennedy School advised that the country move beyond the “catch-all term” of racial profiling, which he said is an overused notion, and look deeper at the Gates controversy to learn from it.
Rather than looking at a situation in terms of racial profiling, Yale law professor Tracey L. Meares said we should see two areas of police action: lawfulness and legitimacy. “When we think only in terms of lawfulness and unlawfulness, then there is no vocabulary and no capacity to deal with an African American man or anyone else who is reacting to a situation and calls it racial profiling,” said Meares.
Several police chiefs in the audience weighed in on the discussion, discussing the steps they took after the Gates incident.
“We had conversations on racial profiling and dialogue about police tactics,” said Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis. “There is a real cultural difference in contact with officers and we were able to work through that. Everyone should be more aware of police tactics.”
Audience member Gabriel Love, who is a student at the law school, said he was “impressed” by the sentiments expressed by police chiefs at the discussion.
“They are aware of the problems with the way the criminal justice system is run now and how ineffective it can be,” said Love. “I appreciate how they seem open to new innovative solutions and aren’t stuck in old ruts.”
CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Oct. 30 news article "Panel Discusses Gates Controversy and Racism" incorrectly identified Ed Davis as Lowell Police Chief. In fact, though he formerly held that title, he now serves as Boston Police Commissioner.

Former member of the Israel parliament Effi Eitam, controversial for his views on the Israel-Palestine situation, spoke to students last night about politics between Iran and his home country.
Even before the event took place, it generated heated debate. As audience entered, member of the campus Palestine Solidarity Committee Abdelnasser Rashid ’11 handed out flyers that called Eitam’s controversial politics “racist and genocidal.”
“I think that it’s disturbing that someone who so openly advocates such racist policies is asked to speak here," said Rashid. "This isn’t what freedom of speech is about."
According to the flyer, Eitam had previously said that Palestinians are a “cancer in the body of the nation” and advocated that Israel “expel most of the Judea and Samaria (West Bank) Arabs from here...Palestinians should be used as human shields by the IDF.”
The event was organized by the Harvard Students for Israel and sponsored by the Jewish National Fund and Media Watch International—a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing Israel’s image through accurate coverage.
Co-President of The Harvard Students for Israel Matthew R. Cohen ’11 said that the decision to host Eitam reflects an intent “to promote a variety of opinion in regard to understanding Israel politics, including that of Mr. Eitam.”
Eitam’s talk avoided the more controversial topics of Palestine-Israel conflict and centered mostly on discussion of an Iranian nuclear weapons program, which he called an “existential problem” that will culminate in “enormous tragedy.”
Eitam predicted that in a year or two, other Islamic countries will follow suit in developing nuclear weapon programs. “It is the opening point for a nuclear arms race within the Islamic world which will not be stopped until the whole region will have nuclear weapons,” he said.
When asked by a member of the audience about his prediction for Isreal’s response to Iran’s nuclear weapon program, Eitam—a former Israeli war hero who gained acclaim for his bravery in the Yom Kippur War—responded that it was “almost inevitable that military action will be taken.”
Regarding the Israel-Palestine situation, Eitam said that there is no easy solution unless Israel begins to take more risk and stop withdrawing from its different settlements.
“I think it’s important for both the U.S. and the rest of the free world to stop the potential spread of rogue regime activity as demonstrated so clearly and so many times by the Iranian regime,” said Cohen after the talk.

Austrian Political scientist Andreas Maislinger stressed the importance of remembering Austria’s role as a perpetrator in the Holocaust at an intimate discussion in the Adams Lower Common Room yesterday.
The Center for European Studies and Hillel jointly organized the event.
“A new genocide is possible everywhere,” Maislinger said. “I feel it is my obligation to remember that Austrians took an active part in the Holocaust. This has been forgotten and neglected for too long,” he said.
Maislinger first publicly voiced this sentiment in 1977 at age 23, when he proposed replacing his compulsory six-month service in the Austrian military with a year working in a Holocaust Memorial Museum.
In 1992, he realized this dream by founding the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service, recently renamed Austrian Service Abroad. The program has over 80 partners in 35 countries.
Maislinger is visiting the United States this week to accept the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust Lifetime Achievement Award, along with Branko Lustig, the Academy Award winning producer of “Schindler’s List,” on Nov. 8.
Maislinger was asked to speak by Martin M. Wallner ’11, an Austrian student who participated in the program by working at the Center for Jewish Studies in Shanghai from 2006-2007.
At yesterday’s event, Maislinger explained how difficult it was to implement his program. He secured a meeting with Austria’s Federal President at the time, Rudolf Kirsch Schlaeger, to pitch his idea. While the meeting was not hostile, he said the answer was a resounding no.
Austria’s official policy was that it was the “first victim” of the Nazi invasion, and any acknowledgment of guilt was deemed unpatriotic, Maislinger said.
Despite this, Maislinger said he was never discouraged enough to abandon his concept.
“I wanted to say the truth,” he said. “If you realize something is wrong, I don’t think you should stand it.”
He said that the fall of Communism forced nations to re-evaluate their histories, and by 1992, the Ministry of the Interior was backing his long-ignored project.
Fourteen years later, Wallner became the first Austrian to complete his service in Shanghai, where there were over 20,000 Jewish refugees following World War II.
Making the choice to participate in a symbolic year of service is still slightly controversial, Wallner said.
“It’s still a struggle, because many people think ‘it’s not your fault, why are you fixing it?’” he said.

Harvard students will be able to watch the “The Wire” for class credit next year.
At a panel last night, stars of the HBO hit series joined Harvard professors in discussing the applications of the show—which depicts the struggles of urban life in Baltimore—in understanding and combating real urban social issues.
“‘The Wire’ has done more to enhance our understanding of the systemic urban inequality that constrains the lives of the poor than any published study” Sociology Professor William J. Wilson said.
African American studies chair Professor Evelyn B. Higginbotham said that there would be a new course in which Wilson will use “The Wire” as a case study for poverty in America.
“I’m going to do whatever I need to do to get into that class. I’m excited,” said Martin A. Kessler ’13.
Attendee Sarah V. Chace ’80, who is also a fan of the show, said she already uses “The Wire” as a case study in a class on community leadership she teaches at Albertus Magnus College in New Haven. She said she came to the event to hear more about how other academics and the actors view the role of “The Wire” in depicting urban life.
The show’s enthusiastic fan base contributed to the excitement surrounding the sold-out event, which was sponsored by the African American Studies Department and two local charitable organizations, the Boston Foundation and the Ella J. Baker House.
“It’s probably the best form of media I’ve ever seen, TV or film,” said Brian D. Goldstein ’04, who now studies at the Graduate School of Design.
Panelists encouraged audience members to internalize these harsh realities of the real world problems that the show depicts and actively work to solve them.
“Everything we’re doing to make the world a better place is really for our kids,” said actor Michael K. Williams, who played stick-up artist Omar Little on the show. “Our kids are dying in huge numbers. It’s the real wire.”
Sonja Sohn, who portrayed detective Kima Greggs, described the work of Rewired for Change, the non-profit she started with other cast members to help at-risk youth in the areas of Baltimore depicted in “The Wire.”
She encouraged audience members to make similar changes in the communities they learn about through “The Wire” and the new Harvard course.
“Become a part of these communities. These circumstances will not change if you do nothing,” Sohn said. “Get it moving. Get it popping. Get up off your butt and do something.”

As Aesop’s fable of the tortoise and the hare shows, an overwhelming favorite is prone to underestimate an opponent.
While “slow and steady” might not be the best description of the Dartmouth football team, it was only six short years ago that the Big Green and its 2-4 record played the appropriately-colored role of tortoise, shattering the Crimson’s hope for an undefeated season with a 30-16 victory at Harvard Stadium.
The following season, Dartmouth threatened to ruin Harvard’s perfect season yet again, but came up one point short after a failed two-point conversion. The Crimson went on to a 10-0 record.
With these two games in Harvard coach Tim Murphy’s memory, the Crimson has not overlooked Dartmouth since, outscoring the team 133-42 in the last four meetings.
“We’re Dartmouth’s biggest game,” Murphy said. “They go crazy to play Harvard. We will get their very best shot. Those guys will be very excited to play.”
This year, the Crimson (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) looks to avoid a repeat of 2003 and remain undefeated in all-important Ivy play when it faces the Big Green (1-5, 1-2) at noon tomorrow at Harvard Stadium—where the Crimson has won 18 of its last 20 games, including every Ivy contest since 2006.
Harvard is tied with Penn atop the Ancient Eight standings, while Dartmouth is in a four-way tie for fourth.
The Big Green is coming off of a morale-boosting 28-6 victory against Columbia. The win snapped a 17-game losing streak, which dated back to 2007.
Now, Dartmouth looks to win a second consecutive game, a feat that it has not accomplished since 2003. Additionally, it seeks its first road victory since 2006.
Leading the Big Green last week was sophomore running back Nick Schwieger, who carried the ball 29 times for a school-record 242 yards, including a 66-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to seal the game.
As a result of these efforts, the Norton, Mass. native was named Ivy League Football Offensive Player of the Week as well as The Sports Network FCS National Offensive Player of the Week.
“Schwieger [is] arguably the best tailback in the league,” Murphy said. “He’s a very good player...very strong, very physical.”
Harvard also benefited from a strong rushing attack in its 37-3 blowout of Princeton. Junior Gino Gordon, freshman Treavor Scales, and senior Cheng Ho combined for 216 yards and two touchdowns.
Both Schwieger and the Crimson backfield will look to build on last week’s successes, especially if their respective passing games continue to struggle as they have in recent games.
After throwing for 312 yards two weeks ago against Holy Cross, Dartmouth sophomore quarterback Conner Kempe completed just eight of 22 attempts for 75 yards and threw an interception against Columbia last week. The sophomore, who is replacing injured senior Alex Jenny under center, did find the endzone twice.
Similarly, Harvard junior quarterback Collier Winters has thrown five interceptions in the last four games, including two against the Tigers. He is averaging less than 175 yards in Ivy League contests this season with a 56 percent completion percentage.
“My main goal [this week] is to have zero turnovers,” Winters said. “I have to make smart decisions on when to throw, when to run, and when to throw it away.”
The highlight of the Crimson passing game last week came in the first quarter when junior receiver Chris Lorditch caught a 77-yard touchdown bomb.
Another wideout, senior Matt Luft, has 125 career receptions this season and is two catches from tying Colby Skelton ’98 for fourth in the team all-time record book.
“There are a lot of great guys on that list,” Luft said. “It is an honor to be up there with those kinds of people.”
Furthermore, if Luft maintains his 16.3-yards-per-catch career average, he will finish atop the list in that category.
On defense, Harvard will be missing sophomore linebacker Alex Gedeon, who has three sacks this season, after he underwent surgery on Wednesday and will be out for the remainder of the season, according to Murphy.
Tomorrow, the Crimson must be cautious not overlook its opponent, or else it risks a fate like that of 2003.
If Harvard stays focused, Dartmouth won’t take home the victory, but instead the tortoise will walk “slow and steady” with its head down back to its home in Hanover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Tim Burton’s Halloween classic, “The Nightmare Before Christmas,” the protagonist Jack Skellington laments how, “I, Jack, the Pumpkin King, have grown so tired of the same old thing.”
Well, Jack, I can relate. After three-plus years of college, things start to get repetitive—especially around this time of year. I won’t have to leave my room this weekend (although I will) to know what’s going on out in the street.
A gaggle of costumed, sleep-deprived overachievers will descend on Cambridge, using their Harvard-infused creativity to display what will surely be a diverse array of get-ups, ranging from topical (“Michael Jackson—brilliant!”) to typical (pick some kind of public servant/household pet/healthcare professional and insert the word “slutty” before it. Voila!).
Drinks will be consumed, mistakes will be made, and you’ll find yourself wondering if the guy in the cop costume handcuffing you and reading something about a girl named Miranda aloud has taken this Halloween thing a little too far.
Sure, Halloween at Harvard still has its charms. But the fact that I’m commiserating with an animated skeleton tells me that I might need a change of pace. Fortunately, the increasing monotony of college life has not extended to Ivy League football, and the Ancient Eight is still full of exciting tricks and treats.
Trick: Dartmouth beat Columbia, 28-6, last week, giving the Big Green its first win since the Bush administration. Apparently Dartmouth sophomore running back Nick Schweiger is still young enough to not know that the Big Green is never, under any circumstances, supposed to be impressive. The second-year broke out for 242 yards on the ground against the Lions, singlehandedly exposing Columbia as Ivy title-race posers while demoting Princeton to official league doormat.
Treat: Buddy Farnham. Everyone knew that the Brown “Killer B” was good. But what the senior wideout is doing this season is flat-out stupid. After catching 10 passes for 197 yards two weeks ago against Princeton, Farnham decided he wants the Ivy League Player of the Year award now rather than later. Last week in Ithaca, Farnham hauled in nine passes for 207 yards against Cornell. To put this in perspective, in the last two weeks, Farnham has gained more receiving yards than the entire Yale team.
With Week 7 upon us, one can only hope that the Ancient Eight teams have even more surprises left in their bags.
PENN (4-2, 3-0 IVY) AT BROWN (4-2, 2-1 IVY)
To date, this is the most important game of the season. How the Ivy League title race shapes up hinges directly on this contest.
If Penn wins, the Quakers set up what will in all likelihood be a battle of undefeated Ivy powerhouses with Harvard in Week 9.
If Brown comes out on top, not only does the Crimson become the clear frontrunner to take home the trophy, but the possibility of an awkward three-way tie for the title remains in place.
The Bears are surging right now, having won four straight since losing two tough games to kick off the season. Farnham and quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero headline a juggernaut of an aerial attack, one that might be too much even for Penn, which boasts the league’s top defense. I think the home team takes this one, and the Ivy pool gets a whole lot murkier.
Prediction: Brown 24, Penn 17
CORNELL (2-4, 1-2 IVY) AT PRINCETON (1-5, 0-3 IVY)
Cornell is a mess. Its best quarterback, Stephen Liuzza, is listed at wide receiver but spends most of his time at running back, which I think says it all.
Even so, the Big Red should easily dispatch Princeton, which is basically a less-exciting version of Dartmouth at this point.
Prediction: Cornell 27, Princeton 20
YALE (3-3, 1-2 IVY) AT COLUMBIA (2-4, 1-2 IVY)
This matchup is almost as uninspiring as the last one.
Yale has scored 16 points in its last two games, and somehow won one of them. The Bulldogs’ imposing defense and non-existent offense make Yale games seem about as fun to watch as UC meetings. Having said that, while it’s unlikely you’ll find me watching our campus’ would-be legislators at work anytime soon, I will trek down to New Haven in November for The Game. Yale, after all, allows kegs at tailgates, while the UC’s history with kegs and the like is tenuous at best.
As for Columbia, I’d rather not speak of the Lions. I heralded them all year as an Ivy League sleeper pick, and how do they repay me? Three-straight losses in ascending order of embarrassment to Lafayette, Penn, and...Dartmouth.
Prediction: Yale 13, Columbia 10
DARTMOUTH (1-5, 1-2 IVY) AT HARVARD (4-2, 3-0 IVY)
Dartmouth blew Columbia out of the water last week, and suddenly the “What Ifs?” start to appear. What if the Nick Schweiger Express, now running with a full head of steam, rolls into Cambridge and plows through the Crimson? What if the Big Green becomes a spoiler, ruining better teams’ championship hopes and turning the Ivy League on its head? What if we all let one week make us forget everything we know about Dartmouth and erect a shrine to Keggy the Keg on top of the John Harvard statue?
Maybe we should all take a deep breath and look at this matchup objectively.
Both teams bring a balanced approach to the game of football.
Harvard is second in the league in total offense, with 1,034 rushing yards and 1,097 passing yards. Dartmouth also mixes up the run and the pass, in that the Big Green allows almost as many yards in the air as it does on the ground and is dead last in the Ivies in total defense.
It’s the perfect storm for a blowout. Expect the Crimson to haunt Dartmouth at every turn tomorrow, turning the Big Green’s dream week into a nightmare.
Happy Halloween!
Prediction: Harvard 42, Dartmouth 13
Last Week: 3-1
Record to Date: 23-13

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2008, an overtime loss on the final day of the regular season left the Harvard men’s soccer team green with envy of Dartmouth, which gained a share of the  Ivy title with Penn after the the Crimson’s loss. This year, the teams are again battling for position atop the Ivy League, but  this time Harvard has the chance to start taking business into its own hands. 
Earlier this week, the No. 14 Crimson—who had at one point been fifth in  the country and seemed like a safe bet for its first conference title  since 2006—needed help to put the team in control over its destiny. Last  Sunday, just as Dartmouth did last year, Harvard got the assistance it required, and it now needs to take advantage of the opportunity to grab  the Ivy crown.
“I think that our team plays with a little bit of a chip on its shoulder  because we feel like we missed out on an opportunity to win the Ivy  League championship [last year],” senior Adam Rousmaniere said. “So yes,  it is motivation.”
Columbia’s road win against the Big Green gave Dartmouth its first Ivy  League loss, sending it into a two-way tie atop the Ancient Eight with  Brown. Each team boasts a 3-1-0 Ivy record with nine points. The Crimson  sits in third at 2-1-1 with seven points, but a win over the Big Green  could shoot it to the top of the standings. If Harvard wins out and Brown ties or loses one of its final three games, the Crimson could be poised to grab a share of the Ancient Eight crown.
All of this points towards a pivotal match on Saturday for Harvard  (10-3-1, 2-1-1 Ivy), who looks to take down No. 21 Dartmouth  (8-4-1, 3-1-0) at Ohiri field.
“I tell [my teammates] that  everyone’s been in big games before, this is nothing new,” co-captain  Brian Grimm said. “If we control things that are controllable we’ll be  just fine.”
The Crimson meets a Dartmouth team which has struggled recently, coming off  two shutout losses to No. 8 South Florida and Columbia.
To win, Harvard will need to manage more offense  than it was able to muster its last time out in a 2-1 double-overtime loss  to Princeton. The Crimson will likely need offensive contributions from  more than co-captain Andre Akpan, the All-American star who has scored  three of the Crimson’s last four goals and has 10 on the season.
“We just need a 90 minute, full game performance by the whole team and  maybe a couple special players to step up and have their biggest game of  the year,” Grimm said.
Defensively, the team will look to shut down  Big Green midfielder Daniel Keat, who leads Dartmouth with seven goals  and five assists on the year; senior Craig Henderson, the defending Ivy  League Player of the Year; and sophomore Lucky Mkosana, the 2008 Ivy  League Rookie of the Year.
This will be no easy task, as the Big Green features the most aggressive  and high-powered offense in the Ivy League, leading the Ancient Eight  in nearly every major statistical offensive category. It is first in the  conference in shots, corner kicks, shots on goal, goals, and points—and  ahead of the second-place team in each of these categories by a landslide.
“Our defense has been very solid all year,” Grimm said. “We’ve faced  some strong offenses before, so I think we’re prepared for a good attack  like Dartmouth has and we expect another solid performance.”
The  game will be a challenge for sophomore goalie Austin Harms, who has  given up just two goals in his past three games—both against Princeton–and has the best goals-against-average percentage and most shutouts in  the league.
At the same time, Dartmouth has also allowed the most scores in the  conference, so Harvard will need to be on the attack against Big Green rookie keeper Sean Donovan.
“We just need to be very sharp on the ball, we  need to make sure we’re moving it quickly,” Rousmaniere said. “They’re a  very skilled team. We’ll have to defend for large parts of the game and  we’ll have to counterattack.”
At the head of that counterattack is Akpan, who is closing in on the  Harvard all-time goals record, sitting just three behind Chris Ohiri  ’64.
While Akpan looks towards that achievement, he and his teammates  hope to prevent the Crimson from losing back-to-back games for the  first time since Sept. 2006. If the team is able to do so, it could mean  a green light to the Ivy title as the NCAA tournament fast approaches.

Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., who was arrested by Cambridge police for breaking into his own house in July, went pubbing with Sgt. James Crowley at River Gods Bar & Restaurant last night. The two seem to have become way more chummy since the summer, when Gates virulently alleged that he had been racial profiled by police and called on Crowley to "beg my forgiveness."
(FlyBy's other favorite Gates-ism: when asked by police to step out of his home, Gates, the University professor and MacArthur "Genius Grant" recipient, reportedly told Crowley, "I'll speak with your mama outside.")
River Gods' owner, Jackie Linnane, told FlyBy that the pair stayed for over an hour and chatted amicably, but she wouldn't specify what they were served other than an appetizer and beer. The River Gods menu includes everything from standard cheeseburgers to "Korean Handrolls" to "Goddess Salad" topped with arugula, pears, and bacon.
"We were really surprised that this even got out," Linnane said, noting that Gates has frequented the pub in the past. "When they came in the early evening it wasn't too busy; they were pretty secluded."
When the duo chatted with President Obama at the White House in July over peanuts and pretzels—the so-called "Beer Summit"—Gates reportedly had a mug of Sam Adams Light while Crowley had a Blue Moon with slice of orange. (Obama had a Bud Light while Vice President Biden stuck with a nonalcoholic Buckler.)

True Love Revolution has been making a lot of noise since The Crimson's publication of Silpa Kovali's editorial last week, called "True Love Revision," in which the author examined points made by TLR president Rachel L. Wagley '11 in an interview.  The piece has sparked a flurry of responses from TLR members, particularly Wagley and former co-president Leo J. Keliher '10, and the conversation—a tense one, it would be safe to say—is all over the Web. FlyBy thought it would be helpful to break down the situation. Check out all the links after the jump.
So, the TLR blog posted a "Response to an anti-TLR Crimson editorial," in which Keliher wrote, "If I had to distill [Kovali's] piece, it would run: 'I interviewed the co-president of a group I disagree with, I misconstrued her statements, and thereby showed the whole group is irrational.'" The conversation didn't stop there. The blog post generated a couple of comments, including one by Kovali and another by Keliher.
Keliher then used the gist of his comment on his own blog post as a letter to the Crimson today. Which elicited a comment from Wagley which was essentially a re-post of Keliher's original blog post. Things getting meta yet?
And then earlier this week, infamous ex-sex blogger Lena Chen '09-'10 wrote an editorial in the Crimson entitled "The Abstinence Mystique." The title says it all. But the TLR people seemed to have taken Chen's message with a better attitude, claiming in yet another blog post that the piece was "more civil than last week’s Crimson fail." But in a comment to her own article, Chen says that Wagley's blog post "fails to address the contradictions I bring up about TLR's interpretation of feminism." More of her thoughts, Chen says, can be found on her personal blog.
Did you catch all that? FlyBy wonders if all involved constituents even had to utter one word to each other during this whole virtual debate. Maybe it's better that way.
