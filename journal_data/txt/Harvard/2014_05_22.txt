After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
Two years ago, I heard Colorado State Senator Michael C. Johnston address a diverse gathering of educators at the Education Nation conference: teachers and principals from all over the country and from all types of public schools.
In that address, I was struck by his lucidity and his thoughtfulness. Johnston speaks and writes as one who had spent a lot of time pondering complex issues. This makes sense, as he’s faced those issues firsthand; as an educator, he worked in some of our country’s most challenging environments. After teaching in Mississippi, Johnston led two of Colorado’s alternative schools, placements that often end up as final stops for the children our schools can’t figure out how to teach. Most importantly, Johnston seems driven to ensure that all our schools serve children as they deserve, giving them the opportunity to reach their fullest potentials—a standard of excellence that no one, I think, would seriously argue we’ve reached.
I was surprised, then, to see that petitioners are protesting his invitation to speak at the Graduate School of Education’s convocation. Their statement asserts that “Johnston embraces a vision of education reform that relies heavily on test-based accountability while weakening the due process protections of teachers, a vision that we believe ultimately harms students and communities.” On these grounds, they call for the Graduate School of Education to rescind Johnston’s invitation.
Reasonable people who care about children can disagree on the best ways to improve our schools. To think differently is to ignore valid concerns and make productive dialogue impossible. All over the country, educators are working on solutions to persistent problems—how do we serve kids who come from challenging environments, who enter school behind their peers in reading and math, or who have a wide range of special needs? How do we ensure that under-resourced urban and rural schools get students to where they need to be, and how can we make the American public school system a model for the world once again?
No group has a monopoly on these answers. To shut out the wisdom and experience of an entire swath of educators—charter or traditional, union or reform, Democrat or Republican—is to deny the best shot to actual children who, as you read this, are not getting the education they deserve for want of those answers.
I am not a student at the GSE. I sympathize with those who have worked hard to gain knowledge and skills that will help them serve students and who now find themselves unenthused by their school’s choice of speaker at their convocation. I also respect the conviction of those who challenge a perspective that they believe will not help children.
But given the raging debates in our field, it’s certain that any speech that everyone agreed with would be boring and useless. As an educator and a member of the greater Harvard community, I hope that sharp conversations about these subjects would be welcome at our University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 was confirmed by the full Senate for a seat on the bench of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals Thursday afternoon in a narrow vote of 53 to 45, despite continued criticism of his role in establishing the legal justification for drone strikes on American terrorists abroad.
Democratic Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana joined Senate Republicans in opposition of the Barron’s nomination.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid brought the nomination to the full Senate only after the White House announced that it would not appeal the public release of the drone memo allegedly written by Barron when he was a lawyer for the Department of Justice. The memo, which many Democratic and Republican senators have cited as a roadblock to their support of Barron’s nomination, established the legal justification for the targeted drone strike that killed American-born terrorist Anwar Al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011.
Senator Rand Paul, of Kentucky, filibustered on the Senate floor for roughly a half hour Wednesday morning in opposition to the appointment before a procedural vote passed on party lines.
The confirmation on Thursday gives Barron a lifetime appointment to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which is located in Boston and has jurisdiction over Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico.
In early May, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to all 100 senators that called Barron’s memo the “legal foundation” for a “large-scale killing program,” and urged senators to read the memo before voting.
Barron, who served as president of The Crimson and attended Harvard Law School before returning to teach, is married to Massachusetts Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Juliette N. Kayyem ’91. He most recently chaired a task force charged by University President Drew G. Faust with writing a new, University-wide email privacy policy, which was approved by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, earlier this semester.
Barron did not return repeated requests for comment Wednesday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s crew posted a strong performance at this year’s EARC sprints in Worcester, Massachusetts. For the Crimson, this regatta was even more meaningful as the squad was competing to claim the newly established cup named for the late Harry Parker, the former Harvard coach who passed away last summer.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
Just 1.7 seconds made the difference between winning and losing for the Harvard heavyweights on Lake Quinsigamond.  The first varsity boat managed to outrace Brown in the Grand Finals, completing the course at 5:27.277, while Brown posted a time of 5:28.998.
With a four-year Rowe Cup streak on the line, the elite heavyweights had to perform in their final heat. After wins in 3V and freshman eight events, Brown was closing in on the title, and it fell on the Crimson’s varsity eight to defend it.
The boat rose to the challenge, as the Crimson posted a time that was almost 30 seconds faster than last year’s time at the EARC sprints. With this new mark, the eight narrowly missed branding a new record for the competition.
Harvard’s 3V group notched a fourth place finish in the Petite Finals, coming in at 5:58:358.
The freshman boat also assisted in propelling Harvard to victory, claiming second place in its heat. Harvard fell to Brown in the tight race, as the Bruno held onto a lead to coast past the red buoys .62 seconds before the Crimson.
In the second varsity division, Harvard was unable to pull off an upset over Northeastern’s 2V group, a lineup that has been ranked first in its division all year. The Crimson put in a gritty effort to finish in fifth place with a time of 5:41.170.
The 4V men just narrowly missed qualifying for Grand Finals with a fifth place finish in prelims, and continued on to claim a fourth place finish in Petite Finals on the day.
In clinching the victory over Brown, the Crimson managed to not only capture the crown, but also claim the EARC cup for a fifth consecutive year, tied for the longest streak in program history. Besides claiming the Rowe Cup, this victory also clinched the Ivy League title, and with the win the heavyweights also took home the Harry Parker cup in its inaugural year, a very special result for the Crimson.
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The fifth ranked lightweight squad managed a third place finish at the EARC sprints, thanks to strong efforts across the board from the Crimson.
“Eastern sprints has an incredible tradition and atmosphere for us, and we’ve been training for this every day that we’ve been together,” freshman Mark Steinbrick said. “There’s always high expectations, and while we had hoped for a better outcome, the team had incredible races across the board.”
The Crimson had its work cut out going into the sprints, with frontrunner Cornell controlling competition from the beginning.
“I think that the league this year is really strong,” junior captain Xander Bonorris said. “All of the teams are really deep, and you can see that in the results... We knew it was going to be tough to compete on the sprints stage, but I was really happy to see all of our crews fight really hard.”
The lightweight crew went into this weekend’s races fresh off of losses to Yale and Princeton at the annual HYP regatta two weeks prior.
“After losing at HYP, we were really looking to close the gap between us and those crews,” Bonorris said. “And we certainly did that this weekend. The goal can only be improvement, and that’s what we showed.”
The freshman eight posted the highest placing performance of the day, claiming second place in its sprint.  The boat put up a strong fight, finishing four seconds behind Penn in Grand Finals.
Both the first and second varsity boats claimed fifth-place finishes at the regatta.  With a time of 5:46, the varsity eight rowed competitively, staying in the contest until the very end.
The 2V group outperformed its own showing that morning by four seconds in the finals. In spite of this marked improvement, the Crimson again fell short of the podium.
“I thought that across the board all of the boats had strong races,” Bonorris said. “We showed some of the strongest performances we’ve seen all year, and I think that’s the most important thing. If you can show improvement from race to race, that’s what really matters.”
