After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long a fixture of Harvard College’s curriculum, the Expository Writing requirement aims to teach incoming freshmen how to draft provoking theses, structure persuasive arguments, and write effective essays of academic caliber. And yet, since its conception in 1872, the program has been reimagined more than once. Most recently, the College has decided to provide students interested in the Humanities with an alternative method of fulfilling the “Expos” requirement: taking the two-semester sequence of Humanities 10a and 10b.
As this change implicitly acknowledges, the existing Expos program is imperfect because it is too formulaic to be useful to all students and to encourage their interest in writing. That said, the idea of having some writing requirement is a good one and the program is eminently salvageable. The administration’s decision to consider a full year of Humanities 10 as a valid stand-in for the traditional single semester of expos is a step in the right direction.
Before this year, students could only fulfill the Expos requirement by taking an Expos 20 class. Students with less writing experience take one semester of Expos 10 before taking the universally required Expos 20. Expos 20 classes discuss varying topics, but purportedly hone the same skills in students across the board: argumentation, clear writing, and self-revision.
But the appearance of choice in subject matter is largely illusory. Students sectioning for expos must rank eight classes by preference, and though the disciplines covered range from art history to sociology, the lottery process does not guarantee that students are placed in a discipline that resembles their academic interests or prepares them for the kind of writing they are most likely to need in their further coursework.
This issue, along with varying levels of experience in most Expos 20 classes, undoubtedly compromises the effectiveness of the program. Students often suffer through a semester of Expos that does not tailor the material to their interests or its instruction to their needs.
That said, a small percentage of lucky students enroll in Expos sections that align well with their interests. These freshmen, who report that Expos gave them invaluable writing skills, are evidence of Expos’ potential. The best way for Expos to serve its students is to combine its current emphasis on rigor with a greater focus on the kind of writing they will be expected to do in later stages of their studies.
The College’s move to have Humanities 10 count for Expos represents an evolution towards this vision of an improved writing requirement. We hope the College will realize that offering discipline-specific courses as Expos alternatives is productive and appealing to students, and will quickly follow this move by adding similar classes from other disciplines to the Expos curriculum. More general classes should continue to exist for those unsure of what they will be studying or who do not have the same writing experience.
Likewise, the requirement of an application for Humanities 10 seems an effective method of ensuring that the class is pertinent to its students on all levels, from subject matter to pace and style of instruction. Still, having only one Expos-eligible class for which students must apply is an untenable and unequal situation; while the College may be using its experience with Humanities 10 as a test run, it should move quickly to include more such courses for students interested in disciplines other than the Humanities.
Expos has long been considered an integral thread in the fabric of Harvard’s liberal arts education. Indeed, its mission is part and parcel of the college’s commitment to creating well-rounded students and effective communicators. The College was right to begin a creative re-structuring of the program; it should now continue to improve Expos so that the requirement is better tailored for all its students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bob Woodward was on to something when he noted that the Hillary Clinton email scandal bears some similarities to the scandal that erupted forty years ago over President Richard Nixon’s Oval Office tapes. Indeed, viewing the firestorm over Clinton’s private email server in light of the controversies that dogged Nixon’s political career underscores how the popular way of framing “ServerGate”–as an issue about classified documents–obscures its more significant implications.
As the Clinton campaign has rightly pointed out, the whole debate about the former Secretary of State’s handling of classified material ignores the confused and ridiculous way in which the United States government decides whether a document should become classified in the first place. Given the poor protocols in place, making political hay out of the issue is inappropriate and a distraction from graver issues of policy.
More crucial is the parallel in attitude between Nixon and Clinton, which may presage problems for the Democratic frontrunner. Both are figures whose careers have given them little reason to feel anything but loathing and mistrust for the press. Nixon famously expressed those sentiments when, after losing the 1962 gubernatorial race in California, he declared, “You don’t have Nixon to kick around any more.”
While in office, Nixon’s efforts to combat leaks and his distrust of the press led to increasingly poor decisions. Seen in the context of eternal hostility towards the media and the Eastern Establishment more generally, Nixon’s decision to cover up his lieutenants’ increasingly illegal activities is the act of a President who never overcame his impression that everyone was out to get him. His desire for complete control led him to lose it entirely.
Therein lies the danger for candidate Clinton. Creating a private email server as Secretary of State is the act of someone with a deep mistrust of anyone but her closest advisers. And while the Clintons’ personal history with the media might justify some of that mistrust, mistrust alone is not sufficient justification to mollify critics in the media, let alone the opposing party and members of the public who are understandably confused by this minor but telling communications fiasco.
Moreover, the presumable purpose of the private server–privacy–has already backfired. Clinton’s attempts to shield her emails from unwanted attention led to the second biggest media circus of the campaign so far, falling just behind Donald Trump’s existence. Just as Nixon’s attempts to protect himself led to his resignation, Clinton’s play for secrecy has led to a very public mess.
Mrs. Clinton should, however, draw some positive lessons from the comparison between her and our 37th President. For one, before Watergate, Nixon was a masterful political survivor. Faced with an apparently crippling scandal as the Republican Party’s candidate for Vice-President in 1952, he delivered the famous “Checkers Speech,” and was able to salvage his career. Unfortunately, Nixon apparently forgot the lessons of 1952 when he most needed them twenty years later, and failed to get out ahead of the Watergate story. His 1973 speech on his final scandal was too little, too late.
The time for Secretary Clinton’s own “Checkers Speech” is approaching. Just as her opponent in the 2008 Democratic Primary, then-Senator Barack Obama, was able to calm the uproar around his pastor with a speech on race relations, a well-timed and honest speech that deals with issues of trust head-on might help right the ship of the Clinton campaign and remind voters of her policy priorities. Just because Clinton has weathered crises in the past does not mean she should be complacent about addressing this one; after all, Nixon’s past performance in 1952 was little guarantee of his future success in the 1970s.
Another reason for Clinton to take heart from the Nixon analogy is that Nixon was far from the worst President in American history, despite his ignominious end. He oversaw one of the great foreign policy coups in American history, the opening to China; he signed the Clean Air Act and created the EPA, ushering in the modern era of sane environmental regulation; and he used the federal government’s clout to help quietly finish the desegregation of Southern schools. He also supported affirmative action, and ushered in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. Of course, Nixon was far from perfect: his acceptance of local housing discrimination over the objections of his Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, former Michigan Governor George Romney, is one prominent example of his placing of politics over people. Compared to the modern day Republican Party, however, Nixon might as well have been a Marxist.
All of which is to say that a need to be in control need not be a detriment to a successful presidency. Clinton may yet make a transformative president—one who can consolidate the gains of the Obama years and begin the tough work of reforming the criminal justice system, addressing economic inequality, and reconfiguring America’s global strategy for the 21st century. First, however, she needs to ensure that the very obsessiveness that might make her an effective chief executive does not lead to her premature political demise.

Logoed t-shirt, KIND bar at your desk, endless supply of both. Free breakfast, free lunch, free dinner, as long as you stay to work. Code on your screen, code on your mind. But you could use a break so you elevator down to the gym. You stop by the custom espresso machine. Towels provided. No need to bring shampoo.
Working in big tech is comfortable not just because your work life is well-endowed, but also because it’s so analogous to college. Roll out of bed, go to class, do some work, eat some food, go to sleep, do it again. It’s the kind of lifestyle where you rarely have to think about the things that facilitate fundamental activities like eating (cooking, grocery shopping, etc.).
At Harvard, future engineers receive a sneak peek at life after college through Computer Science 50. Walk into any CS50 event, whether it’s Puzzle Day, the first lecture of the semester, or the annual Hackathon for those slaving away on their final projects. You ought to be surprised if you don’t walk out with a full belly, a free t-shirt, some bumper stickers, (and maybe slightly worse vision?) It’s almost as if the pain of all-nighters and impossible problem sets is merely the price you pay for what are now considered rite-of-passage “Harvard experiences,” like receiving an ice pop from David Malan walking around Annenberg at 12:30AM.
By the time you hand in your last p-set for CS50, it is hard to imagine “doing tech” any other way. In fact, big tech companies catch CS50 students at just that moment when they come out to recruit at culminating events like the CS50 Fair. The students wearing Quora and Facebook shirts around campus likely have never worked for the company. Rather, these t-shirts symbolize the cycle facilitated by the large tech companies that sponsor the glamorous perks of taking CS50, a course that has become an icon, and a brand, on campus.
As a CS50 alum, I still stand in awe of the scale at which Harvard’s introductory computer science course runs, the creativity evident in its curriculum and the extent to which student involvement makes it all possible. But I also ponder, often and deeply, on whether it also might have given me a limited understanding of what technical literacy means in the context of our larger society. While its growth trajectory so far is understandable as a means towards making computer science more attractive and approachable for students, I believe the next great step that CS50 can take is to introduce its students to the impact their skills can make in the realm of public service.
Indeed, the need for elite yet humble technical talent is skyrocketing in the public sector right now, and with the initiation of exciting projects like the U.S. Digital Service, it is not an exaggeration to say that the time is now. As a social studies student who has not continued coding after CS50, I helplessly observed through my summer internships and field research that many important things are broken, many necessary things are nonexistent, and that staff and budgetary resource problems perpetuate this situation.
The problem that these public sector employers face in recruiting talent is twofold. They lack the opportunities to visit campus and recruit at the level of perk-ridden private sector companies, and they lack the glitz needed to appeal to a student population that has been habitualized to the charm of big tech culture.
Given the difference that socially minded and service-oriented technical talent can make today, CS50 has the potential to make an unprecedented impact on communities, cities, states, and countries around the world. This is not to say that the course should not do all the wonderful things it currently has in store for its students; in fact, the “cool factor” of CS50 is indispensable in drawing students to pick-up a skill with endless potential to better our society. But perhaps with a heavier emphasis on understanding our technical capacity as a public asset, more students will pick up the initiative and courage to leave the KIND bars behind.

UPDATED: September 18, 2015, at 12:11 a.m.
Harvard has raised more than $6 billion in gifts and pledges in its capital campaign, charging still closer to its public goal of $6.5 billion, according to an email addressed to Faculty of Arts and Sciences campaign steering committee members that The Crimson obtained on Thursday.
The FAS’s campaign has also nearly reached its $2.5 billion goal, having raised a total of $2.2 billion, according to the email. 
The University-wide fundraising drive is now two years into its public phase, which launched with fanfare in September 2013. Harvard had already received $2.8 billion in gifts and pledges during its “quiet phase” at the time of the launch, and since then it has moved ahead at full steam, propelled by nine-figure gifts from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89, to College financial aid; billionaire Gerald L. Chan, to the School of Public Health; and hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson, to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Despite the progress ahead of schedule, University President Drew G. Faust said last week that officials have no current plans to raise the campaign’s goal. She also declined to share an updated fundraising total. The target of $6.5 billion would be a higher education record if met.
Officials were more forthcoming, though, in the recent communication with FAS donors. An online report linked in the email to the FAS campaign steering committee, dated Aug. 31, paints a portrait of the FAS drive’s progress so far, detailing each of the campaign’s priorities, the scale of its gifts, and the regional breakdown of all donations. It also includes a graph detailing fundraising progress that runs through June 2018, suggesting that the campaign still has nearly three years of public phase fundraising remaining.
Though the FAS drive has received 179,721 total gifts, a majority of the $2.2 billion total has come from 40 donors who each gifted $10 million or more, raising $1.27 billion combined, according to the report. A total of 60,835 donors have contributed to the FAS campaign so far, and 303 people have given $1 million or more. A graph of FAS’s fundraising progress since 2011, the quiet phase of the campaign, shows that the total raised has steadily exceeded the projected track necessary to meet the campaign’s 2018 close.
The report also includes initial projections of the number of gifts FAS expected it would need to reach its goal. Officials projected that FAS would need two gifts in the $100 million range (to date, it has received one, at $125 million); five donations in the $50 million range (it has received three, totaling $195 million); and 15 contributions in the $25 million range (it has received seven, totaling $213 million).
Officials also hoped to court one mega-gift of $250 million or more. They have achieved that, through Paulson’s record-breaking $400 million donation to SEAS.
As for the number of donations of less than $1 million officials expected to receive, the report simply said FAS needed “many.”
At the beginning of its campaign, FAS officials named a number of priorities toward which gifts could be allocated. Some, according the report, are ahead of schedule. SEAS has raised $590 million, far exceeding its $450 million goal. The majority of that total comes from Paulson’s $400 million gift—the single largest donation in Harvard’s history—which renamed the school. In another prominent gift last year, former Microsoft CEO Steven A. Ballmer ’77 paid for 12 new Computer Science professorships.
Another priority doing well is the “Faculty and Our Scholarly Enterprise” category, which includes professorships and has raised $541 million toward its $600 million goal.
Gifts directed toward the student experience, such as athletics, have brought in $204 million, while financial aid at the College—helped in large part by Griffin’s 2014 gift—has accrued $386 million of its $600 million goal. The Dean’s Leadership fund has raised $163 million and has a goal of $250 million.
Some priorities, like the College’s much-touted House renewal project, are further from being fulfilled. House renewal fundraising, which supports construction like the renovation of Dunster House, is just under its halfway mark, at $197 million in gifts and pledges with a goal of $400 million. Another priority that has catching up to do is “Leading in Learning,” which has raised $62 million in gifts and pledges but has a goal of $150 million.
The report also details the geographic makeup of the money. Forty-three percent of FAS funds raised, a plurality, originate from the New York area. Eleven percent of the money comes from Boston, 9 percent from Chicago—where Griffin lives—8 percent from the Asia-Pacific region, 6 percent from the San Francisco Bay area, and 4 percent from Los Angeles.

The Office of Student Life opened a new office this fall to provide additional resources for first-generation, foster-home, and undocumented students, supplementing existing offices focused on diversity at the College.
The Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, as it is called, is currently not staffed, but the OSL will likely name the office’s inaugural director in the next few weeks, according to Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College's assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
The office will fall under the purview of dela Peña, who also oversees the College’s other diversity-centered offices, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the Harvard College Women’s Center. While these offices are also dedicated to supporting programs related to diversity, dela Peña said the new office offers an expansion in resources and staff and fills gaps in programming.
“There are so many dimensions of diversity that we don’t even talk about,” dela Peña said. “We’re not taking away anything from these offices; in fact, we’re adding support to them.”
The current freshman class is one of the most diverse in recent years, and 16 percent of freshmen who responded to The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2019 are first-generation college students.
For his part, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said he hopes the new office will reach a new segment of the student body. 
“It was out of a desire to be really egalitarian in our approach,” Lassonde said. “We haven’t done enough to make sure people feel included and welcome.”
In addition to searching for a new director, the OSL has also solicited applications from students who wish to serve as diversity peer educators; the application period ended Wednesday. Students hired for the position will facilitate workshops and dialogue in the Houses and Yard. The peer educators, who will be paid, will first complete an eight-week training program.
Peer educators’ work in the Houses is part of an effort that both dela Peña and Lassonde characterized as a deliberate attempt to engage more with the Houses.

The research arms of HarvardX and the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching have merged to create a new research group, according to Harvard’s vice provost for advances in learning, Peter K. Bol.
The new VPAL Research Group was created to formalize the close relationship between research on digital learning—conducted by researchers for HarvardX, the University's branch of virtual education platform edX—and on-campus learning, conducted by HILT. 
The move comes less than a year after the discovery that HILT researchers conducted lecture attendance studies that involved photographing undergraduates without their prior knowledge or permission.
Government professor Dustin Tingley, who will serve as faculty director for the new group, said he was “deeply invested” in addressing privacy concerns. Tingley referenced the Committee on Undergraduate Education, a joint student-faculty committee, as a source of institutional oversight for the new research group.
Tingley’s group will consist of four research scientists, two of whom have already been hired. Senior research scientist Yigal Rosen joins the group from the education publishing firm Pearson, where he worked researching effective assessment methods.
Working alongside the VPAL research group will be the VPAL Research Committee, chaired by Education School professor Andrew D. Ho. The committee, which will be made up of about 17 faculty members, will provide guidance and expertise on research projects conducted by the VPAL group.
The new VPAL Research Committee replaces the HarvardX Research Committee, previously chaired by Ho. In a statement, Bol said many former members of the HarvardX Research Committee will follow Ho to the VPAL Research Committee.
Individual committee members may also suggest and conduct their own studies with the support of the research team, according to Tingley, the faculty director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science's Undergraduate Research Scholar program and founder of ABLConnect, an online resource for “active learning” initiatives.
While HarvardX will retain some in-house researchers associated with their course development team, HILT will not.
“HILT won’t have its own internal research group but they will be fundamental to my collaborating with other faculty because they have a great [faculty] network,” Tingley said.
The VPAL Research Group will work at the same Mount Auburn Street offices that contain HILT and HarvardX.

The Warren Alpert Foundation has donated $20 million to Harvard Medical School, joining a string of multimillion-dollar gifts to the University as it rolls through its $6.5 billion capital campaign. 
Money from the gift will be allocated among three priorities delineated by the foundation, according to a press release announcing the donation. A sum of $5 million will fund the a new Department of Health Care Policy professorship.
Another $7.5 million will endow the Warren Alpert Foundation Discovery Fund for Immunologic Research. The Medical School will be able to use the fund to fuel research in the field of immunology.
The last $7.5 million is slated to finance the Warren Alpert Foundation Dean’s Leadership Fund, which Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier—and future deans—can put toward the Medical School’s most pressing needs as he sees fit.
“I am grateful to The Warren Alpert Foundation for its long-standing partnership, generosity, and visionary commitment to our priorities of service, leadership, and discovery,” Flier wrote in an email Thursday. “It is only with the support of partners like this that we can continue to fulfill our mission to alleviate human suffering caused by disease.”
The Medical School and the Warren Alpert Foundation have a long history of collaboration, according to Flier. The school’s departments of neurobiology and systems biology, among other offices and centers, are located in the Warren Alpert Building, and the foundation previously endowed a basic research professorship.
The Warren Alpert Foundation is a philanthropic foundation that aims to promote innovative scholarship in the world of medicine.
The Medical School has a capital campaign goal of $750 million

UPDATED: September 18, 2015, at 1:05 a.m.
Despite student efforts to stop the project, Harvard Campus Services is scheduled to pave a 4,000-square foot portion of the Malkin Athletic Center Quad to create 18 new parking spots primarily for senior faculty members.
Starting at the end of September, workers will begin to remove trees and pave approximately 10 percent of the sloped northernmost section of the Quad, a grassy area adjacent to the gym of the same name and Lowell, Winthrop, Eliot, and Kirkland Houses. The process will last about seven weeks, according to Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga.
Upon hearing rumors that Campus Services planned to pave part of the MAC Quad, Darragh Nolan ’15 -’16, a Kirkland House resident, started a MoveOn.org petition in an attempt halting the construction that will take place near his dorm. The petition, which blasted over House listservs on Wednesday night, correctly asserted that a portion of the MAC Quad would be converted to a parking lot but overestimated how much of it, suggesting that one-third of the grassy space would be paved.
“Harvard talks so much about common spaces that it seems so hypocritical of them to destroy one of the green spaces on campus,” Nolan said. “The biggest problem is that they seem to be doing this in secret.”
Although it is not clear if officials consulted students on the decision to pave a portion of the MAC Quad, Harvard does have plans to revisit and improve the space at a later date. During Winthrop House's renovation, which is slated to begin next summer, Harvard plans to landscape and regrade the area, also adding lighting, sidewalks, and bike racks, according to deLuzuriaga. Landscapers will also re-plant trees and improve the drainage system in the Quad.
In the meantime, nearly 500 students have signed a petition rallying around sun, grass, and frisbee, some writing comments lamenting the loss of a portion of the lawn.
“Green spaces in general are a positive thing, especially for students who are doing homework or just hanging out,” said Michael C. A. Leonard ’17, a Winthrop resident who signed the petition. “The MAC Quad is especially a good place for students to do that.”
Students take to the MAC Quad for a number of outdoor activities, including lounging and sports practices. Zac D. Bathen ’17, the captain of the Harvard Horntails Quidditch team, said he practices on the north end of the lawn with his fellow “Harry Potter” enthusiasts twice a week. Team members run drills on their makeshift Quidditch “pitch,” which Bathen says runs most of the length of the lawn.
“I don’t think it’s the right move for Campus Services to make,” he said. “The team is upset, and they are definitely standing behind the petition and share my concern.”
Harvard also hosts a range of events on the MAC Quad, including mental health study breaks and Harvard’s annual celebration of Holi, a Hindu festival that involves students throwing colored chalk at each other.
“It would be very sad and unfortunate if Harvard lost another green space,” said Caroline S. Juang ’17, a co-chair of the Environmental Action Committee, which hosts an Earth Day celebration on the lawn every April.
One major Harvard donor also questioned the merits of the project. Peter L. Malkin ’55, a New York real estate mogul, was surprised to learn that part of the grassy space adjacent to the gym bearing his name would soon become a parking lot.
“The ‘MAC Quad’ is a unique breathing space in a congested area. I hope that a low level use such as parking would not be seen as justifying such a ‘seizure,’” Malkin wrote in an email to a reporter.
Malkin carbon copied Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith on the message “so that he will know of our concern.”

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak spoke on Thursday at the Institute of Politics about the need for closer U.S.-Israel political and military cooperation in the wake of the historic Iran nuclear deal reached between Iran and the P5+1 countries in July.
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, moderated by Kennedy School of Government professor Graham T. Allison, came just hours after Senate Democrats blocked a third attempt to pass a resolution of disapproval against the Iran deal. The international agreement would significantly restrict Iran’s nuclear capability for the next 10 to 15 years, limiting plutonium production and uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief.
Barak—who also served as Israel’s defense minister from 1999 to 2001 and later between 2007 and 2013—called for greater American support for Israeli defense.
“The most urgent objective should be to resume [a] working relationship between the Prime Minister’s office in Jerusalem and the White House,” Barak said.
He added that it was a reasonable time for Israel to “request or expect that the American administration find a way to equip Israel with the tools to carry out an independent operation, if the need arise [sic], against the ... Iranian nuclear program.”
Barak said the United States and Israel should work together to decide what would constitute a significant violation of the nuclear deal by Iran, and what kinds of violations should bring sanctions or even a military option back on the table.
Barak said the Iran deal gives a sense of legitimacy to the Iranian government and, more importantly, has diminished global authority to “block any other third-grade players who wants to turn into a threshold nuclear power.” He suggested a “suspect, and verify” framework in dealing with Iran, a reference to President Ronald Reagan’s “trust, but verify” policy on relations with the Soviet Union.
When asked about the extremist militant group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Barak advised not overestimating the group’s military strength.
“There are 30 or 40 thousand people basically driving Toyota pickups with one or two of the ’70s machine guns—they don’t have a single artillery battalion, attack helicopters, a drone, or jet fighter,” he said. “They were not trained by your Marine Corps, they were trained by Saddam Hussein officers—this is the same army that couldn’t take over Iran for eight years.”
Still, Barak called for a decisive, coordinated action against the group, which he did not think could be dealt with peacefully.
“If you want to shoot, shoot — don’t talk,” Barak said. “Every passing week that ISIS is still on its feet … gives them a huger [sic] prestige and ignites the imagination of young Muslims.”

Dozens of undergraduate men, and for the first time women, lined up outside a red door at 76 Mount Auburn St. early Thursday evening to participate in a decades-old Harvard College ritual: the final club selection process known as punch. 
The Spee Club, one of the College’s eight unrecognized all-male final clubs, moved last week to go co-ed after more than 150 years, distributing invitations to its first punch event to both men and women. National media outlets quickly casted the move, first reported by The Crimson, as the dismantling of a significant gender barrier at Harvard.
By Thursday, when prospective members of the Spee visited its Mount Auburn Street property for receptions at 5 and 7 p.m., some of the campus’s original surprise seemed to have dissipated. It was replaced by festive anticipation, as men and women slipped into formal attire to take part in the competitive social selection process.
Alongside dresses in various shades of red stood navy blue blazers and khakis; the Spee’s flag waved in the warm wind. Smiling undergraduates exchanged quick greetings with Spee Club members before they made their way to the club’s courtyard. A second door, a direct entrance to the courtyard, stayed closed for most of the night, although members intermittently opened it to leave, offering a quick glimpse into the elite social scene.
For the prospective members who arrived late to the event, betraying a typical seven minute grace period iconic of the College, entry was more difficult.
Two women in purple-colored clothing apologized for their tardiness. Other stragglers followed what became a routine: attempting to swipe into the club but quickly realizing that, as they are not yet members, they do not have access to the club. They had to knock on the door, try the building’s intercom system, and finally wait a few minutes to enter.
Shortly into the gathering, clangs of glasses and tableware, mixed at times with coordinated applause, reverberated over the sound of ongoing traffic on Mount Auburn Street. Some passerby paused briefly as they passed the building or mentioned the club as they continued on. “Yeah, they’re under scrutiny,” one woman said as she passed, referencing the national media attention the club has attracted. “I know a guy who got punched,” another passerby commented.
Several students who attended the punch event declined to comment as they streamed out of the reception. One student, after he started to describe his experience to a reporter, asked if he was permitted to speak with The Crimson. To this, a middle-aged man in a checkered shirt who did not identify himself said potential members would face automatic disqualification if they spoke to the press. With that, the sophomore departed.
Two women ate cookies out of a red solo cup, as others, likely hoping for a chance to return in a future round, departed the building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 21, 2015, at 12:18 a.m.
Harvard Law School professor Jeannie C. Suk argued at a forum in New York this week that the criminal court system, not campus resources, should investigate and adjudicate cases of alleged sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape.
At the forum—hosted by Intelligence Squared Debates and titled “Courts, Not Campuses, Should Decide Sexual Assault Cases”—Suk and Yale Law School professor Jed Rubenfeld argued in favor of the motion. Michelle Anderson, the dean of City University New York School of Law, and Stephen Schulhofer, a professor at New York University School of Law, argued in favor of university involvement in the contentious issue. 
“What campuses are doing under pressure from the Department of Education is hurting the cause of gender equality,” Suk argued during an opening statement. “Campus tribunals use procedures that lack basic fairness and often reach inaccurate outcomes.”
Suk’s argument was largely in line with the now-prevailing opinion on the issue among Harvard Law School professors. Last October, a group of 28 Law professors wrote an open letter in The Boston Globe, blasting Harvard’s approach to handling sexual harassment for what they claimed were its insufficient protections of the accused.
Suk was one of the professors who signed that letter. Prompted by heavy lobbying from the discontented Law professors, the school is now rolling out a new set of Title IX procedures that differ from Harvard's central process for investigating and adjudicating sexual assault cases. The Law School’s process provides attorneys to students involved in cases and creates a separate, adjudicatory panel to determine guilt, potentially after a hearing.
Suk’s involvement in the developments at the Law School were a subject of discussion at the debate.
“Harvard has its division on the issue. And you are among 28 Harvard Law professors who issued a statement opposing the university's new policy and procedures on sexual violence,” ABC News correspondent and debate moderator John Donovan said during introductions.
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights found the Law School’s old sexual harassment framework in violation of Title IX last year.
Under the rules of the debate in New York, Suk and Rubenfeld lost. Anderson and Schulhofer argued that the criminal justice system was not the proper place for handling cases of on-campus sexual assault.
“The fact is that bias against victims of sexual assault has a well-documented, 200-year history in the criminal justice system,” said Anderson, the dean of CUNY School of Law. “But even when the system harbors no bias whatsoever, campuses must be able to decide sexual assault cases.”
Suk is not the only Harvard Law professor who has started arguing for Title IX policy reform outside Harvard. Janet E. Halley, another Harvard Law School professor who played a leading role in calling for the school's new process, has traveled to several other colleges and universities throughout the country to discuss Title IX issues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While undergraduates flocked to Mount Auburn Street to take part in the Spee Club’s fall punch process on Thursday evening, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana met behind the scenes with the leaders of final club graduate boards in the Radcliffe Quad.
The meeting, which took place from 5:30 to 7 p.m. in Cabot House’s senior common room, is just one in a line of many conversations that College administrators have had with representatives from Harvard’s elite unrecognized social groups in the past year.
Khurana acknowledged last week that he is working on a set of recommendations about the clubs and the College’s social scene more generally, but beyond that, he and other administrators have been quiet on specifics. 
Khurana and other representatives from the Office of Student Life did not return requests for comment Thursday night on their meeting with the graduate boards. Several final club graduate board leaders, for their part, either declined or did not return requests for comment, including Fly Club graduate board president John L. Powers ’70, who wrote in an email that Khurana asked attendees to keep the meeting confidential.
The clubs have quieted in recent weeks as they face mounting scrutiny from Harvard officials. Earlier this month, University President Drew G. Faust weighed in on the groups, citing concerns over the potential for alcohol abuse and sexual assault to occur on their off-campus properties. She also took issue with their elite status on campus.
“As we broaden the reach of the College to individuals from much more diverse economic backgrounds, as we emphasize the need for inclusion of all groups, to have certain groups that can dispense privilege and advantage in very significant ways that exclude individuals from membership is very troubling,” Faust said.
In the wake of these administrative critiques, many of the clubs seem to have altered their behavior. The Fox Club went members-only last spring, and last week the all-male Spee Club extended punch invitations to women, a historic move to go co-ed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two years after Harvard set an official capital campaign target of $6.5 billion, a would-be record for higher education, the University has brought in more than $6 billion in gifts and pledges, 92 percent of its objective. 
With three years of fundraising left, the question is not “if,” but “when” Harvard will reach its public goal.
“I think that most of the administrators felt that…way deep down they expected to exceed their goal,” said Mitchell L. Dong ’75, a top donor of scholarships to the College. “I think they’ll blow by their goal and exceed it, by who knows how much.”
Starting with a nucleus of $2.8 billion in gifts and pledges, the public phase of the Harvard Campaign launched in 2013 and promised to be the most ambitious fundraising drive any university had ever undertaken. Now, just two years later, Harvard has reached a new, record tier of giving. Ahead of schedule, it seems poised to pass Stanford, which raised $6.2 billion in a drive that ended in 2011, to become higher education’s most valuable campaign.
In the past, other schools in Harvard’s position have raised their campaign targets to adjust to giving. Last week, though, University President Drew G. Faust said upping the goal—less than $500 million away—was not in Harvard’s plans. Instead, the University’s ninth-year leader said she hopes to refocus the drive not on a total amount, but instead on achieving its component priorities.
This week, an internal report shared among top donors about the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ portion of the campaign, sent to the FAS campaign’s steering committee and obtained by The Crimson, shed some light on those areas that might need more attention. While the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences had surpassed its $450 million goal by $140 million, another objective, “Leading in Learning”— an initiative focused on enhancing the teaching experience through technology—has raised only $62 million of its $150 million goal, according to the report dated Aug. 31. 
More notable is the House renewal priority, which so far has raised less than half—$197 million—of its $400 million goal. Harvard has already scheduled the renovation of Winthrop House in 2016-2017 and the renewal of Lowell House in 2017-2018, and administrators previously estimated that House renewal will cost between $1 billion and $1.3 billion, some but not all funded by the Harvard Campaign. A message to campaign steering committee members accompanying the internal report nevertheless celebrated the “rave reviews” of renovated Dunster and confirmed that the committee will convene in the House in late October.
“I believe that the committee so far has been able to cover the work that has been undertaken so far, but obviously it’s going to take more effort,” said Peter L. Malkin ’55, a member of the FAS steering committee.
Filling in the holes of the campaign, even after it has reached its overall goal, could prove a difficult task. As Faust attempts to refocus the fundraising conversation, however, she runs against grain. Leaders of other top schools in recent years have not hesitated to up their targets mid-campaign.
At Yale, fundraisers decided to increase their $3 billion target to $3.5 billion in 2008 after they had reached $2.3 billion—about 77 percent of the goal—in the first two years of the campaign. The campaign ended in 2011 with $3.9 billion in gifts and pledges. And during a fundraising drive at Columbia, administrators decided to raise their goal from $4 to $5 billion after they brought in more than $3.9 billion from 2006 to 2010. Their campaign ultimately raised $6.1 billion by the end of 2013—an Ivy League record.
Other schools have waited until they hit their goal before raising the bar even higher. Cornell upped the ante on its $4.75 billion capital campaign by $1 billion for the final year-and-a-half of the fundraising. The campaign, set to end this December, has surpassed $6 billion.
Paul G. Schervish, the director of the Center on Wealth and Philanthropy at Boston College, said keeping momentum is a key way to sustain energy during a long campaign.
“When you have a campaign, you are already engaging your development officers and your alumni in a way of thinking and acting to raise money and to give money,” Schervish said. “There are a set of strategies that they have in place already.”
Yet the current record-holder for the biggest fundraising drive in the history of higher education—Stanford—did not raise the stakes in the middle of its campaign. Starting with a $4.3 billion objective, Stanford donors kept writing checks after the school reached its goal, ultimately raising a total of $6.2 billion.
For now, this appears to be the course Harvard is choosing, but top donors think the conversation about raising the goal is worth having—especially because it looks promising that it will be met soon.
“I think that [Harvard] should raise the goal if the commitments continue to come in at the current rate,” Malkin said.
Dong and Paul J. Zofnass ’69, a member of the elite donor group the Committee on University Resources, agreed in separate interviews.
“If the momentum is with you, you take advantage of it,” Zofnass said.
Schervish, though, suggested that the good times may not last forever.
“One of the things that happens is that they usually get the biggest gifts early on,” Schervish said. “There are diminishing returns in a campaign.”
Faust and Tamara E. Rogers ’74, Harvard’s vice president for alumni affairs and development, have both echoed that logic, cautioning in interviews that the campaign will experience slow points. They just have not happened yet.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the campaign and voting period for the Undergraduate Council’s fall general elections ended on Friday at noon, 44 undergraduates won spots on the UC.
Although the Council had to extend the deadline for declaring candidacy by several hours to attract more candidates, the election cycle ended up featuring a range of candidates—136 in total, and as many as 25 in the freshman Elm Yard—and prompted several extensive campaigns from freshman and upperclassman UC hopefuls alike. 
Of the elected representatives, 39 percent are Council veterans, meaning they won their campaigns for reelection, according to UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16. Of the representatives elected on Friday, a plurality, 19, are sophomores, while 12 are freshmen. Just under 30 percent of the newly elected portion of the Council is made up of juniors and seniors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that Harvard football locked horns with the Rhode Island Rams, the result was lopsided.
Beneath early October skies, the Crimson opened its season with a commanding performance. Captain and All-American Charles J. Hubbard Jr. patrolled the line of scrimmage, fifth-year coach Robert Fisher maintained a perfect opening-day record, and Harvard ended the day with a 35-0 win.
That game was in 1923.
Ninety-two years later, Rhode Island will have a shot at revenge when Harvard travels to Kingston, R.I. for a Saturday matchup with the Rams.
Much has changed since that long-ago contest. For one the goalposts are no longer at the front of the end zone.
But one constant has remained, and that is the expected dominance of the Crimson squad. In 1923 Harvard entered on the heels of a 7-2 season; in 2015 the team will kick off the Rhode Island contest .nd. with a 14-game winning streak on the line, not to mention the lingering memories of last year’s Ivy League title.
“It’s our first game,” said captain and linebacker Matt Koran. “We’re definitely looking to get a win, but we want to come together as a group.”
The same could be said for the Rams, which started the season with a pair of defeats against Syracuse and Albany.
Both those games, which Rhode Island lost by a combined score of 82-7, took place at away venues; Saturday will mark the Rams’ home opener.
Home or away, Rhode Island found precious little shelter during the 2014 season.
Opening with a 48-7 loss to Marshall, the Rams played nearly three months of football without a victory. Then, in the last week of the season, the team pulled out a 13-7 win over Towson to avoid a winless season.
What Rhode Island lacks in proven experience, it makes up for in youth.
Junior quarterback Paul Mroz had never started a game before this season, and in his first four quarters of play, he received a baptism by fire at the hands of the Syracuse defense. Held to just 60 yards of passing in that contest, Mroz rebounded a week later with 180 yards and a touchdown on a 17-of-38 showing.
The team’s top wide receiver, freshman Khayri Denny, also lacked game experience before this September. But Denny has emerged as a legitimate target for the Rams, racking up over 100 yards of combined offense and totaling the squad’s lone touchdown across both games.
Mroz and Denny share the offensive workload with sophomore running back Harold Cooper, who averaged 41.7 yards per game during last year’s 1-11 campaign.
The Rams will face a stout test against Harvard’s defense, which topped the FCS in several defensive categories last year. Although the Crimson lost stalwarts Zack Hodges ’15 and Obum Obukwelu ’15 upfront, the team returns a deep corps of linebackers and defensive backs.
“We hope to be very fundamentally sound in this game,” defensive back Chris Evans said. “Looking at our second inter-squad scrimmage, we had some things we needed to clean up…. Things have been progressing pretty well this whole preseason.”
Harvard’s efforts received a vote of confidence when the team was placed at No. 25 in the FCS polls heading into the season. The Rams have lost 14 straight games against ranked opponents.
However, one potential wrinkle in Harvard’s plans for dominance is the nature of the playing surface.
Like most other college teams, the Crimson typically practices and competes on artificial turf. But Rhode Island’s Meade Stadium is all grass, posing a challenge of novelty for Harvard players.
In response the Crimson has held sessions on the natural grass at Cumnock Field. This preparation, and all other sessions that Harvard has undergone this preseason, will come to a head at 1pm on Saturday afternoon.
“It’s great to be able to start with game one,” quarterback Scott Hosch said. “We’re just ready to play. We’re ready to get out there in a game scenario and really show the country…what we can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard football team takes to the gridiron this Saturday, it will have been 301 days since the squad closed out its perfect 2014 season.
And yet, nearly a year later, the scene in the University of Rhode Island’s Meade Stadium will look remarkably familiar.
Harvard has taken three of the last four Ivy championships, including the 2013 and 2014 titles. With a plethora of returning starters, the Crimson is the preseason favorite to repeat again. Of the 22 starters that helped produce just the third undefeated season in a century, 14 are back—seven on offense, seven on defense.
“Obviously, we set the bar high,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We have quite a few starters from an outstanding team a year ago…. We have the expectations at least to be a very solid football team that can compete for a championship.”
After junior quarterback Joseph Viviano was sidelined two weeks ago with a broken foot, senior playcaller Scott Hosch—who had been competing with Viviano throughout the preseason for the job—was named the starter, a position he is well-acquainted with.
Named the backup quarterback in preseason last year, Hosch was called under center when then-starter Conner Hempel ’15 was injured in the season opener. The then-junior went on to start six games, including the penultimate matchup at Penn, where the team clinched a share of the Ancient Eight title.
Hosch’s supporting cast knows a thing or two about playing under pressure. Senior wideout Andrew Fischer became a fixture in Yale nightmares last year when he scored the game-winning touchdown with under a minute left in The Game to complete Harvard’s 10-0 season. Fischer, who had a breakout season in 2014 with 1,298 all-purpose yards and 677 yards receiving, is joined in the receiving corps by classmate Seitu Smith, as well as rookie Justice Shelton-Mosely, tabbed the College Sports Madness Preseason National Freshman of the Year.
“Those guys can make plays,” Hosch said. “All I have to do is get them the ball in time and just put them in a position to make plays.”
Also returning is senior running back Paul Stanton, who with a full season ahead of him already sits at fourth and seventh in the Harvard record books for career rushing touchdowns and rushing yards, respectively. Behind a veteran offensive line that brings back three seniors in Anthony Fabiano, Cole Toner, and Adam Redmond, it will be unsurprising if Stanton continues to rise in the ranks.
If there had been a question mark for the team at this time last year, it was on the other side of the ball. By the culmination of the 2014 season, however, the answer was not only good enough to top the Ivy League, but yielded the top defense in the FCS in points allowed and sacks.
A year later, there are few questions. The young secondary group of last season has become the experienced backfield of the defense; all three starting linebackers return, including captain Matt Koran, who in November became the 11th consecutive defensive captain. Even the line, which has the least game-time experience of the defense, features juniors and seniors two deep at almost every position.
“I think us being a veteran group is going to make the game so much easier, make the play slow down, and we’re just going to be one unit out there, flying around, making plays, getting better,” Koran said.
Harvard struggled on special teams in 2014, finishing sixth and eighth in the league in field goal percentage and average punt distance, respectively. Kicker Kenny Smart and punter Zach Schmid, both sophomores, will be taking up kicking duties this season.
Between an undefeated record, ESPN’s GameDay kicking off a thrilling version of The Game, and another championship in the books, last season’s performance would be a Herculean task for any team to follow.
But the 2015 rendition of Harvard football, similar as it may be to the 2014 version, has its eyes looking forward.
“This is a new year, a new season,” Hosch said. “There are always high expectations here. We always expect to win every game, but we’re only focused on this game, this year. Whatever happened in the past, this is a new team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first goal of junior forward Rachel Garcia’s Harvard career could not have come at a better time. The transfer from the University of Georgia lifted a lob over New Hampshire junior goalkeeper Mimi Borkan to lift the Crimson women’s soccer team (2-4-1) to a 2-1 victory and snap the squad’s three-game losing streak. Despite outshooting the Wildcats, 24-9, Harvard needed overtime for the second straight season to get past New Hampshire (2-4-3) and its physical defense.
“It was an exciting way to end,” Garcia said. “[Senior] Emily [Mosbacher] played a great ball to me and the goalie was a little bit out, so I was able to chip her, and it was a fun way to end the game.”
The win was the Crimson’s first of the season at Jordan Field and the team’s first since its opener against Army. Junior forward Midge Purce broke Harvard’s 244-minute scoreless streak with a tally right before halftime. Purce weaved her way through the New Hampshire defense before dribbling around a diving Borkan to give the Crimson the early advantage.
The matchup to watch entering the evening was Harvard’s struggling offense taking on a Wildcats defense that had allowed six goals in its previous two games. The Crimson controlled the ball for almost the entire game and outshot New Hampshire by at least six shots in each half.
“I think overall, everyone just went out there as a team,” Garcia said. “We all pressured together, and we’re getting in a groove together.”
After Harvard generated several scoring chances to start the half, New Hampshire mobilized one of its only offensive rushes into the Crimson zone. After Wildcats sophomore forward Brooke Murphy left a centering pass, second-year midfielder Gabrielle Sloan buried it. Harvard junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack got a fingertip on it, but the shot sailed into the net’s upper left corner.
It was one of the only mistakes the Crimson defense, the strong point on the team’s recent road trip, made all night. Captain Haley Washburn, junior Bailey Gray, sophomore Marie Becker, and freshman Hannah Natanson each logged at least 90 minutes in protection of Durack.
“I think pressuring as a team [was key],” Gray said. “We’ve really been focusing on team defending this year. We’re all in it together and that’s led to our success.”
While Durack did not have to face many shots, the New Hampshire defense was busy almost the entire night. The Wildcats, playing only their second true road game of the season, committed 12 fouls and senior defender Kirsten O’Neil picked up a yellow card late in the game.
“I think we just had to be physical, too, and take it out on them as much as they took it out on us,” Garcia said.
New Hampshire only used two substitutions the entire game, including zero in the first half. Meanwhile, Harvard used five subs to keep the pressure on the Wildcats for all 93 minutes.
“We’re extremely deep,” Gray said. “Everyone on the field is great,:we have so much talent. It’s been really awesome this year.”
Purce picked up her team-leading second goal while Garcia became the fourth different Crimson player to score this season. The Duluth, Ga. native tallied eight goals and 11 assists while playing for the Bulldogs over the last two seasons. A draw would have been difficult for Harvard to swallow considering its recent offensive struggles and myriad scoring chances.
“I think it was huge,” Gray said. “It gets the ball rolling, gets our confidence up. It’s a good thing scoring goals.”
The Crimson improved to 8-1-0 against New Hampshire under ninth-year coach Ray Leone. Harvard went to 1-0-1 on the year in overtime games while the Wildcats fell to 0-1-3.
“It was definitely exciting,” Garcia said. “We’ve had a couple losses so it’s been tough for us. So, for us as a team, [it was key] to be able to get over that and move forward with the season.”

The definite best thing about the appearance of fall is not the changing of leaves nor the apple picking. It is the reintroduction of the Pumpkin Spice Latte. But the people are not satisfied by treating their pumpkin spice addiction with mere lattes alone. As HUDS has been recently trying to up their game, there can be some recommended new menu items in order for them to capitalize on the power of pumpkin spice.
Pumpkin Spice Muffins
Instead of walking all the terribly long way to Starbucks or Au Bon Pain, why not just have it in the dining halls? We already have chocolate and blueberry ones. It could probably force people to wake up earlier in the morning to get one before they run out.
Pumpkin Spice Blondies
How can we make one of the best HUDS desserts even better? Add some pumpkin spice. Hopefully these are not 940 calories too.
Pumpkin Spice Soup
We can’t just live on TomBasRav and (sometimes) New England Chowder. Maybe it would have actual pumpkin inside.
Pumpkin Spice Swai
Cilantro and Lime Baked Swai Fish. Blackened Swai. Swai with Honey Ginger Glaze. Lemongrass Swai Thai. Crispy. Swai. Fish. Sandwich. Adding pumpkin spice to swai is unfortunately not too much of a stretch.
