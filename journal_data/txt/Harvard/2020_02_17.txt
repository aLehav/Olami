After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long hiatus (dubbed a “retirement”), Nicki Minaj hopped on Meghan Trainor’s new single, “Nice to Meet Ya,” released Jan. 31. Unfortunately, not even the self-styled “Queen of Rap”’s contributions could salvage this unimpressive pop single. Trainor’s signature sound is repetitive pop, marked by repeated phrases establishing its fundamental structure. Some of Trainor’s most popular singles, “All About That Bass” and “No,” are prime examples of this heavy reliance on repetition, and her latest single does not deviate from that sound: “Nice to Meet Ya” is yet another, tired iteration of the same style.
In this case, she opts for a whispered “Nice to Meet Ya” as her main hook. The overall boppy beat in the background of the hook seems to suggest that she is going for a sultry vibe with these whispers, yet she only achieves a somewhat unsettling tone. As the song progresses into the verse, she finally gives listeners some melodic material to work with, but it is painfully predictable. The autotune overlaying Trainor’s vocals adds artificial texture to the verses, and those combined with a synth build-up produce an EDM-like sound leading into the chorus.
The chorus is perhaps the only section of intrigue within the entire single, with its vocal chromaticism and rhythmic brass filling out the upper arrangement. Just as the song begins to compel a substantial head bob, the post-chorus arrives with another round of Trainor’s manic whispering, followed by a brief break for a rap verse. Nicki Minaj’s verse simply gets the job done; it is right in line with her features on similarly formulaic pop songs Little Mix’s “Woman Like Me” and Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish.” Nicki raps over a rather dry beat — lacking any real sense of deliberateness — and falls back on her favorite bars about being “the billy,” a reference to being a billy goat or the Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T.), and the “champ.” These are not terrible qualities for a rap to have, but they are neither interesting nor inspiring.
The actual lyrical substance of “Nice to Meet Ya” is moderately commendable. Trainor encourages women to navigate life with confidence and ignore the critics (“Go ahead and tell them whatever you heard / I look different on the surface / You know ain't nobody perfect”). She continues to motivate listeners to accept themselves for who they are with lines like “I don't know you, but I'm just what I wanna be.” This type of uplifting rhetoric has become a staple in both Trainor’s songs and her overall message as an artist.
Despite its positive messaging, “Nice to Meet Ya” is good for a listen or two but hardly memorable. Nicki Minaj’s feature is little more than a nice reminder that she can still pump out her standard rap verse for another pop single. But overall, the biggest takeaway from “Nice to Meet Ya” is that whispered greetings will never not be disturbing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I visited the Kennedy Space Center, I couldn’t wait to see Launchpad 39A. From that exact spot in Florida, humans first broke free from the Earth’s gravitational pull to visit our neighbor, the Moon. Besides the Apollo program, 39A was used as the launchpad for dozens of space shuttle missions. I believed that standing in such a historic location would make me feel closer to space without ever needing to leave Earth.
So, I was shocked to find that Launchpad 39A had been leased to SpaceX and completely remodeled. While nothing could erase the significance of the location itself, SpaceX’s logo undermined the many groundbreaking NASA missions that had been conducted there. At risk of sounding melodramatic, it felt like something sacred had been violated.
This experience speaks to a broader trend that has characterized modern space travel. For most of the 20th century, getting anything into space was only feasible for massive government agencies funded by billions of taxpayer dollars. But now, as the required technologies have gotten cheaper and corporations have gotten larger, private companies have been able to play a far more central role in spaceflight.
Is this expansion of private control over space travel something we should worry about?
Yes and no. For one thing, private companies are free from much of the “red tape” that is characteristic of government agencies, so they can often get things done quicker. To space enthusiasts who are disappointed by NASA’s depressingly slow progress over the past 50 years, that speed can be exciting.
But speed can also lead to recklessness. Without the oversight and accountability of a taxpayer-funded agency, private companies are able to brazenly move forward in the pursuit of profits without regard for the public good.
Elon Musk has said that the rocket business is “an extraordinarily difficult place to make money” — he even warned potential investors that “maximizing profitability is absolutely not something I care about [...] so don’t complain later that I’m not maximizing profitability.” This sounds refreshing, at first. A private company that doesn’t care about profits — how noble! But, if we believe Elon that making money through rockets is difficult, then private companies may have to cut corners just to stay afloat. And, in spaceflight, cutting corners can have deadly consequences.
So, given the obvious shortcomings of private space companies, should we dream of a return to the era of government-led spaceflight?
I think that would be a mistake. Yes, NASA does have stricter oversight, better safety parameters, and decades of experience. But it’s also plagued by tremendous administrative issues.
For one, NASA’s budget as a percentage of federal spending has been in an overall decline for decades, which has severely restricted its performance. But, occasionally, NASA’s budget does increase. President Donald Trump’s most recent budget proposal included a 12 percent raise to NASA’s budget (and massive cuts to social welfare programs). It’s certainly no coincidence that the Trump administration’s mandate for NASA centers around a manned Moon mission in 2024 — the last year of Trump’s presidency, should he win re-election.
This type of political gambit is not unique to Trump; historically, each new administration has changed NASA’s targets to align with the political goals of the person in power. This has caused NASA to operate on four or eight year intervals, constantly switching its focus to carry out the new mandate set by the president. This short-term thinking is a formula for disaster, given that space missions require decades of planning.
So, when viewed separately, private spaceflight companies and public space agencies each have major shortcomings. But the path to successful spaceflight lies in collaboration.
NASA can give private space companies what they desperately need: research on safety and efficiency, the massive infrastructure required to transport and launch rockets, and valuable oversight to make sure everything goes according to plan. NASA has been in the spaceflight game for decades, so newcomers like SpaceX and Blue Origin would be wise to learn from them.
On the other side, private companies can innovate — and, since they have less bureaucracy, they can implement their ideas faster than an agency like NASA. In return for their contributions, they can receive massive government contracts, which they’ll likely need to stay afloat.
NASA has caught on to the fact that public-private cooperation is essential for the future of space exploration. Over the past decade, the Kennedy Space Center has transitioned toward becoming a “multi-user spaceport” that facilitates launches by numerous private companies. NASA’s decision to lease Launchpad 39A to SpaceX was one step in that process.
I shouldn’t have judged that decision so quickly. Many of those involved in space travel often describe how they are thrilled to be part of the process of exploration — a process that will continue after they die. If you had asked Neil Armstrong, he probably would’ve said that the worst-case scenario for a launchpad is for it to fall into disuse.
So, I’m ultimately glad that SpaceX is getting some use out of Launchpad 39A. I look forward to seeing what private companies and NASA can do together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a dominant 73-58 win over Cornell (9-11, 2-6 Ivy) Friday night, Harvard (14-7, 5-3) struggled to keep its momentum going into Saturday, ending the long road trip with an 89-64 loss to Columbia (13-8, 4-4).
HARVARD 73, CORNELL 58
Sophomore guard Tess Sussman led Friday’s victory with a career-high 20-point performance. She was joined in double figures by Maggie McCarthy, Jeannie Boehm, and Lola Mullaney, with Rachel Levy’s nine-point, 10-rebound effort helping secure the win.
The Crimson jumped out to an early 22-15 first-quarter lead, as freshman standout Mullaney buried three early triples and senior forward Boehm punished the Big Red with three inside baskets. By halftime, a 38-19 Crimson lead signalled the women were playing with a level of energy and focus that Cornell simply could not match.
Boehm, a four-year starter, ended Friday’s contest with 14 points, but it was her two blocks, six rebounds, and effort on the defensive end that coach Kathy Delaney-Smith found praiseworthy.
“I think Jeannie’s probably one of the best defensive players in the league,” Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think anyone really talks about that, we talk to her all the time about her value is almost more on the defensive end and as a rebounder than on the offensive end. I think she’s pretty lethal on both ends of the floor.”
Boehm has also displayed a vision and passing ability from the post, leading Harvard with six assists Friday.
“The fact that she’s had so many assists for us, just speaks volumes for how unselfish she is,” said Delaney-Smith.
And after struggling mightily to score early in the second half, it was Boehm who laid in the Crimson’s first second-half bucket at the 4:44 mark in the third quarter.
Despite Cornell managing to shrink the Harvard lead to 10 in the third quarter, the Crimson defense and grit Delaney-Smith has been preaching did much to prevent the Big Red from cutting the lead to single digits. A shooting barrage from Sussman, who made three three-point shots and scored 11 of her 20 points in the fourth quarter, extended the Harvard lead out of reach and helped her team notch its fifth win in the last six games.
HARVARD 64, COLUMBIA 89 
Harvard continued its long road trip in New York City Saturday, where a hungry and deep Columbia squad capitalized on its chance to climb up the Ivy League Standings, ensuring that the Crimson dominance on Friday would not continue on the second night of the back-to-back.
The Lions did a good job containing Harvard’s leading scorer. Mullaney has been a consistent scoring presence for the Crimson this season, and her 15.3 points per game rank amongst the top in the Ivy League. Against Columbia, though, Mullaney struggled early to create offense. She remained scoreless until 1:19 remained in the first half, showing signs of possible fatigue and trouble adjusting to the back-to-back nature of Ivy League play.
“[Mullaney] thinks she can play 40 minutes a night, I think learning how to do that is part of being a Division One athlete in the Ivy League. It’s a hard, hard road trip with all of the bus time, so she did not have her legs,” said Coach Delaney-Smith following the loss.
Although initially trading baskets with the Lions, Harvard’s inability to get a shot off as the first quarter buzzer sounded indicated this was not the focused, engaged Crimson team that had rolled the previous night. Columbia sprinted out to a 20-4 run to end the first half, and continued cruising through the second half.
The loss did afford some players with an opportunity to gain valuable experience on the court. Freshman guard Annie Strizel took full advantage of her time, finishing with a career-high eight points on three-of-five shooting from the field. Junior forward Maddie Stuhlreyer chipped in with a career-best nine points and a team-high six rebounds as well.
“Annie [Strizel] played really hard off the bench, she played hard,” said Delaney-Smith. “She has great court IQ. I thought she did a pretty solid job coming off the bench. I have Sara Park, she’s a tremendous shooter. Gabby Donaldson, a tremendous athlete. [The freshmen] all have potential. [...] They have enormous potential.”
Mullaney, Boehm, and Levy all finished in double figures with 12, 11, and 10 points, respectively. As Harvard marches on through Ivy League play, the Crimson will need its young, less experienced players to take their games to another level and provide much needed bench depth.
As for Lola Mullaney, Coach Delaney-Smith has little worry her young star will bounce back from Saturday’s struggles.
“The transition to college basketball is massive, and for her to be as solid and consistent as she is for us is tremendous. She just gets better every time she steps on the floor.”
With the Crimson facing another tough road trip at league-leading Princeton (19-1, 7-7 Ivy) on Friday and second-place Penn (15-5, 5-2) Saturday, Harvard will need to rebound quickly if it hopes to solidify its spot in the Ivy League Tournament.
