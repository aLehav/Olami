After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to public pressure, Harvard recently announced plans to divest from a source of funding it called “utterly abhorrent.” The announcement declared shared community values, gave hard numbers, and laid out a plan to both address immediate harm and create structural change. In other words, it was everything the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign has asked for — just not for prisons.
HPDC has been petitioning Harvard to divest from the complex web of companies propping up and incentivizing the continued construction and filling of prisons — inevitably with black, brown and other politically marginalized bodies. The group’s arguments have largely been met with either silence or straw men responses.
By contrast, the revelations surrounding billionaire Jeffrey E. Epstein’s human trafficking and his extensive connections to Harvard led to a community-wide response that almost directly parallels HPDC’s demands. Harvard clearly knows how to do the right thing — when it cares to.
So, I’m asking Harvard to listen to Harvard and take some lessons from its own announcement.
First, show your values. University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s announcement opened by condemning the actions and losing no time in considering the victims. This kind of unequivocal language is how all healing should start. Harvard’s response to HPDC, however, has been to deflect any commitment to values by holding that divestment from prisons would make the endowment “political.” Not only is it farcical to hold that all investment is not inherently political, but prisons themselves are the sites of concentrated sexual violence against black and brown people, including against minors. So representing the horror of prisons as an issue to be debated rather than condemned as unequivocally as the human trafficking involved in the Epstein case points to a possible racist divide on whose lives Harvard values.
Next, take responsibility and think structurally. The administration’s reaction in the Epstein case — committing to “review how we prevent these situations in the future” rather than considering this an isolated event — acknowledges the effect donations can have on research and dramatically contradicts the “apolitical” and “slippery slope” arguments comparing divestment from prisons to divesting from corn syrup by creating standards by which to judge the sources of their donations (and, by extension, the endowment). In admitting that such standards indeed exist (which we all knew, given that Harvard has divested from tobacco, South African apartheid, and PetroChina), Harvard reaches the same conclusion as HPDC. All that’s left is to convince the administration that state violence against marginalized communities falls on a different side of those standards than corn syrup.
No one is saying this won’t be hard — including Harvard. Bacow stressed that Harvard’s decentralized process would make tracking Epstein’s donations and those directed by him difficult but worth the effort. He has also insisted, however, that only Harvard’s investments in private prison companies like CoreCivic should be up for debate, denying the existence of the vast prison-industrial complex that continues to incentivize the caging of black and brown people. This expansive view may make divestment more difficult, but, as with the Epstein case, it’s worth the effort.
The administration was also refreshingly transparent in the Epstein case, not only sharing hard numbers but also trusting their audience to understand that this is still a first step. The administration’s transparency in the Epstein case was refreshing. By contrast, requests for information about the University’s investment in the prison-industrial complex have seen Harvard playing dumb by holding to the narrow view of the prison-industrial complex described above, claiming without evidence that investments amount to “only” $18,000, a number that has been contradicted by mandatory public filings.
Harvard also seems to know the value of reparatory justice. In the Epstein case, Harvard plans to “redirect the unspent resources to organizations that support victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.” Acknowledging this as “an unusual” but “proper” step for the University, Harvard reaches the same conclusion that HPDC does when asking for reinvestment of divested funds into the communities most harmed by state violence: It’s not enough to acknowledge the harm. Apologies require reparations.
As unjust as it is, moves by Harvard have an outsized influence, and its leadership position therefore comes with its own set of obligations. That’s why arguing that the costs of divestment aren’t worth the alleged $18,000 invested falls flat: Harvard is perfectly willing to play hero by “engag[ing] [their] peer institutions” in addressing the structural problems that led to the Epstein case. When the values match up, Harvard knows the alleged $18,000 isn’t actually $18,000; it is, in fact, the limitless potential of a major voice in American discourse ringing the bell that something is deeply wrong and giving an example of what can be done about it.
Bacow closed his message by repeating shared values and with the humbling posture that “Harvard is not perfect.” While healing and justice require these acknowledgements of harm, they also require shifting one’s disposition when discovering new harms, not just speaking the words when cornered. If Harvard is truly acknowledging that it is not perfect and will indeed “always strive to be better,” then it should start now: Divest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the scandal over admissions and athletic qualifications at Harvard and across the nation, the University has instituted a variety of policies requiring proof of athletic prowess as part of the athletic recruitment process, according to Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
The reforms, which also include increased conflict of interest training, come as Scalise is preparing to step down from his position. Looking forward, we are encouraged that there is room for a new direction in the Athletics Department along a number of dimensions, including the strengthening of these kinds of processes to prevent fraud. Beyond that, we also hope to see improvement in regards to gender parity and multiple instances of sexual misconduct in the department.
In addition, the Athletics Department should consider the efficacy of conflict of interest measures, given the unambiguous nature of the infractions in the admissions scandal. These policies, as well as the fact-checking processes and the way in which the department approaches its new sanctions enforcement policy, are further areas to consider for improvement.
Needless to say, these are vast domains that span across many fields under the purview of the Athletics Department, each with its specific challenges and opportunities. However, before considering any specifics and implementing any changes, the University must reflect and clarify the role of athletics at Harvard, since it is impossible to move to more detailed processes without an explicit, well-understood goal.
Currently, the Harvard Athletics mission statement offers two broad objectives: “Education through Athletics” and “Build[ing] Community and Pride in Harvard.” More specifically, the department values “the lessons that have long been taught by athletic participation” and aims to “[build] community through the engagement of students, faculty, staff, and alumni.” However, these high-minded goals still leave many questions unanswered.
How should student-athletes balance their roles in athletics and at the College more broadly, and how should they be evaluated for admissions? How do athletics contribute to student life and culture at the College? How should the Athletics Department reconcile the need for socioeconomic diversity with existing entry barriers in certain sports? What role should coaches and the department play in an admissions process that is supposed to be “the same” for athletes and for other students?
We do not have definitive answers to these questions. In fact, we may not be informed to make these decisions, but we believe that the answers to these questions should form the basis of the new direction that Scalise’s successor should pursue. As Scalise will continue to advise Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay until 2021, we hope he can share his institutional knowledge in this search. That knowledge, coupled with a sincere desire to clarify the place of athletics at the University achieve concrete improvements in each of these domains, should animate the search for a candidate well-equipped to take on these challenges and lead the Athletics Department in a new era.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometime earlier this year, I was waiting for the walk sign that would let me cross from Harvard Yard to Harvard Square. I can’t quite remember where I was heading, only that I had a million and one things to do once I got there — and maybe because I was so caught up, I almost missed the yelling behind me.
I turned abruptly, mostly confused until I spied the man on the other side of the road, shouting out a string of rather unimaginative slurs about Muslims, foreigners, and the age old classic bit on terrorists. He noticed my attention and got more animated in his insults, perhaps emboldened by the distance between us, but at that point I’d already dismissed the situation and carried on my merry way. Those million and one things couldn’t just wait around for Islamophobia.
Friends of mine later urged me to go to HUPD to report the incident but I didn’t bother for two reasons: Even if the campus police did track down this guy, bigots tend to be determined when it comes to holding onto their narrow-minded ways, and secondly — I was used to it. See, I’ve been conditioned to know how to read the way a person looks at me, my family, and my friends; taking in the hidden judgments from their stiff expressions or blatant biases in their direct glares as cues on how any given interaction will proceed.
I was dutifully told in the comments of my previous article that: “If you choose to wear the uniform shared by terrorists and suicide bombers then you should expect to have people look” — but unfortunate as it is, hatred doesn’t have one specific attire. It can come in the form of anything from a boarding school outfit to a presidential suit and tie. There’s no precise gamble on when people will show their ugly colors, which is why I’ve learned to never engage: not in middle school when the man sitting beside me on the bus kept making leering comments, or with the woman on the train who screamed at me to go back to my country when I was in high school. And these are just some of the tamer incidents.
With all this, I was not surprised that the same festering sentiments of racism and bigotry had found a home in the cracks and corners of Harvard. After the 2016 election, for example, a fellow student joked that I should start packing up my things. Holly Yan wrote in a CNN article on everyday racial profiling: “For every story that makes the news, there are countless others that don’t involve police. Black customers who get followed too closely by store employees. Hispanic students and Muslims who get asked if they’re really American.”
It is easier to cope with laughter. Joking about a difficult encounter with your friends makes the situation easier to process. We’ve used this familiar cushion many times to brush off the scary incidents that frequent our lives too often. In the aftermath we’re always just grateful that things that things did not escalate into anything worse.
From my experience, I will admit that I have a learned-wariness when it comes to authority figures, which is why it is especially disappointing that The Crimson has reaffirmed a commitment to continuing to request comment from ICE’s media office. How easy must it be to claim objectivity at the cost of those who are vulnerable to an organization that has perpetuated a continuous harm through severe measures of racial profiling.
Safety is not an assurance for certain communities in the United States, not even a place as prestigious as Harvard. There will always be students who have to be a little more on guard, a little more careful. I already shared how my own mechanism of defense is to brush off the moments that don’t feel safe, to repeat my parent’s advice of knowing when to stand up and when it is better to tread closer with caution when it comes to adding fuels to the unpredictable fires of racism and bigotry. But there’s a limit to how much we can ignore and for how long. Because the pointed looks and insensitive comments, the ignorant slurs and hateful jeers, they’re all going to reach an inevitable breaking point for us — if they haven’t already.

Stephen Prina trudges up the five stories of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts and sits down in what he calls his “loitering space.” Wearing a color-coordinated outfit — blue jacket, blue sweater, blue shirt, and a blue and yellow scarf — he welcomes me into the “loitering space,” a normal room containing a table with eight chairs around it. He places his notebook on the table in front of him and says, “I think that in all disciplines, it’s absolutely necessary to know how to loiter.”
Prina teaches Art, Film, and Visual Studies 80: “Loitering: Studio Course.” The class “hangs out in the vicinity of culture” and reacts and responds to the environment around them in order to produce “cultural work,” according to its course description. The work the class produces ranges from photography and video installations to “civil disobedience as performance,” Prina says.
At first, it may seem as though Loitering is a masterclass in artist creativity and creation. Prina, however, hates what he calls the “C-word” — creation. He asks his students not to create, but rather to respond to their environment. He believes that “anytime [students] make a mark on something, there is a precedent that is established in history that they can consider.” His class is an exercise in reaction rather than invention.
He first made the class, he says, in order “to respond to Harvard culture,” to provide an alternative to “the goal-oriented strategies” that the people at this university often hold dearly. Although he “would never ridicule” the goal-focused mindset of the institution, he holds that “these people don’t know how to loiter.”
Loitering, to Prina, is “the idea of slowing down, relaxing the focus upon the goal. And being in the moment.” He uses loitering as a “conceit” to share with students the “materials” to make art.
But Prina only recently started using the word “art.” He did not “think it was useful” as a term to describe the process of cultural production. So in his class, he says he does not “care if they make art or not” — students in the class can make whatever they want. The cultural work produced in his class ranges from oil paintings to playing the same note on the Sitar for an hour. Prina says all he wants is for his class to “leave with a sense of pleasure in the things that they've made,” and to understand that “when they jam materials together, it’s actually linked to cognitive thoughts.” He wants to soften the hardwiring that compels students to move at one hundred miles per hour, to encourage them to slow down and explore the “rough edges” of their work.
Prina is not a big fan of another “C-word,” this one being critique: the process by which students in most AFVS courses analyze one another’s work. He says he has no interest in having people use their “newly found intelligence to beat other people into submission” and force them to abandon the dissonance found in their work in order to make it “conventional, more normative.” He wants class members to embrace their deviations from convention.
“A lot of what I do with my approach to pedagogy is that I focus upon an apathetic moment or crisis moment or a trauma moment that I have had, and I want to share that in some way with my students,” Prina says, “because that accelerates their moving from point A to point B.”
Prina says he cannot teach his students anything. This nuance in his pedagogy allows Prina to be “like any other spectator” simply viewing a piece. He believes that his “non-expertise viewpoint” allows students to break the mold they have been stuck in throughout their academic careers.
Prina does not want Loitering to be comfortable for his students. When discussing his resentment for the comfortable, he evokes the words of the French philosopher Roland Barthes.
“Roland Barthes’s book is sitting over there,” he says, pointing to a book at the end of the table. “He was known to say that ‘I’m not interested in comfort in art. I don't look for comfort in art. I look for jouissance’ — he wanted to have an orgasm. He's looking for orgasm in art, not comfort. And I think that that's very, very important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard had a University-wide surplus of $298 million in fiscal year 2019, up from $196 million in 2018, according to Harvard’s annual financial report released Thursday.
University revenues rose to $5.5 billion, a 6 percent increase, according to the report. The largest source of University revenue was distributions from Harvard’s more than $40 billion endowment, which made up 35 percent of total revenue. Tuition, at 22 percent of revenue, and research grants, at 17 percent, were the next-largest revenue sources.
Increased demand for executive and continuing education programs bolstered general tuition revenues in 2019, according to the report. Executive and continuing education programs, representing 9 percent of the University’s revenues, have been consistently profitable and saw a 12 percent increase in net income this fiscal year. These programs are offered at nine of Harvard’s 12 schools, including Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School.
Expenses also edged up in fiscal year 2019 to $5.2 billion, a 4 percent increase. By far the University’s largest expense was employee salaries, wages, and benefits at half the total value.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in the report that, while the University is in good financial condition, it faces challenges several challenges from Washington, D.C. — from the endowment tax to fluctuating research spending.
“Uncertainty in federal research funding and the damaging tax on college and university endowments in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also have the potential to hinder Harvard’s ability to grow investments in financial aid, teaching, and research across campus,” he wrote.
Though the endowment tax guidelines have not been finalized by the United States Treasury, the tax went into effect for the first time this fiscal year. University estimates put the additional burden of the endowment tax at $49.8 million for fiscal year 2019. The implications of this tax on operations, however, remain uncertain, according to the report.
“This new burden is approximately equal to 1% of revenues, or viewed in the context of maintaining affordability, less money is now available for University to maintain financial aid, which totaled $193 million for undergraduates this past year,” the report reads.
The report also focused heavily on Harvard’s advanced planning for a period of economic downturn. It highlights several measures that University leaders have asked each school to prepare, including five-year plans and creating a “Recession Playbook.”
Bacow wrote that an economic downturn could threaten the University’s financial health even with proper planning.
“The prospect of a long-running period of economic expansion coming to an end is very real,” he wrote, referring to the possibility of a recession.
Harvard’s schools that depend more heavily on the endowment face the most uncertainty in times of economic challenge. The report indicated that Harvard’s schools “vary widely” in their dependence on the endowment for funding. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and Harvard Divinity School draw the highest portions of their funding from the endowment, at 87 percent and 74 percent, respectively.
Donors supported 43 percent of University revenues in fiscal year 2019. Current use gifts increased slightly to $472 million from $467 million last fiscal year, which saw record numbers for current use giving in part because of a five-year capital campaign.
Harvard also relies heavily on research funding — both public and private. In fiscal year 2019, the University saw a 6 percent increase in non-federal sponsored research funding, part of a shift toward privately funded research in recent years.
“Nonfederal funding has been an area of growth in the past few years, as researchers look beyond the federal government for research funding support,” read the annual report.
Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar wrote for the second consecutive year that he was “not pleased” with this year’s endowment performance, which returned a lackluster 6.5 percent earlier this month, a decrease from the past two years.
Natural resources investments, which make up 4 percent of the endowment, posted a 12.4 percent loss in fiscal year 2019, making it the endowment’s worst-performing asset class for at least the second year in a row.
“We are obviously disappointed with persistent negative returns in this legacy part of our portfolio; however, we are pleased to have cut our exposure by more than half — from 9% to roughly 4% of the overall endowment — since my arrival,” Narvekar wrote.
Harvard’s natural resources investments have come under increased scrutiny from climate activists in recent years. In addition to calls for Harvard to divest its endowment from fossil fuels — which are not held in this asset class — activists have criticized Harvard’s land holdings in Brazil and California's Central Valley.
Correction: Oct. 25, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that fossil fuels are part of Harvard's natural resources investments. In fact, they are not part of that asset class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new game room featuring retro arcade machines with games like Galaga, Pac-Man, and Centipede opened in Pforzheimer House on Oct. 13.
“The Den” — brightened by neon lights, painted walls, and multicolored floor tiles — also houses a pinball machine and an air hockey table. House staff and students worked throughout the summer to renovate a bike room in the basement of Comstock Hall and convert it into a social space that fits several dozen people.
Pforzheimer’s House Committee coordinated with house faculty deans and the building manager to develop plans for the Den over the spring semester. Two HoCo members, Connor C. Sakmar ’20 and Francisco Matos Jr. ’20, stayed on campus throughout the summer and worked for more than 150 hours to assist with the renovation and design.
In an emailed statement, HoCo members called the project a “team effort” and wrote that the Pforzheimer House staff and faculty deans were supportive in constructing the space.
“The Den was created with the intention of fostering community within Pforzheimer House and providing an additional inclusive and safe social and recreational space for students here,” Matos wrote.
After constructing the space, HoCo members tasked fellow students with testing the game equipment and decorating the Den.
Though many Pforzheimer residents have not yet had a chance to visit the Den, some students say they look forward to socializing there.
Calvin M. Stewart ’20 wrote in an email that he plans to visit the space to “destress and just have a little fun.”
“Whenever I get the urge to play some retro games, or I want to show my roommates who’s the best at Street Fighter II, I’ll be there,” Stewart wrote. “People tend to get competitive with the high scores. Hopefully, I’ll get my initials to the top of one of the scoreboards.”
Maximilian J. Wang ’20 said he especially likes the ambiance of the Den.
“I really like the vibe in there,” he said. “It’s got all the lights, the neon.”
Pforzheimer HoCo members wrote that they are pleased with the number of students who visited the Den over its first few days open and hope it will become a popular spot.
“The best part of The Den has been the strengthened House Community that it has fostered,” they wrote.

Five members of Divest Harvard met with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Senior Corporation Fellow William F. Lee ’72 Wednesday to discuss their demands for the University to divest its more than $40 billion endowment from fossil fuels.
Wednesday’s meeting comes as the campaign has escalated their activism in recent years. Their current demands include complete fossil fuel divestment by Earth Day 2020 and a commitment to reinvest those funds more sustainably.
“We’re here because we care about this university,” wrote Ilana A. Cohen ’22 in a statement Divest Harvard issued Thursday. “We take that deadline of Earth Day 2020 very seriously. There’s a moral and financial imperative [to divest], and the case for divestment has been made.”
In addition to Bacow and Lee, Harvard Management Company’s Managing Director for Sustainable Investing Kathryn I. Murtagh attended the meeting. Lee — who leads the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — reiterated administrators’ longstanding position that Harvard does not use its endowment for political purposes, the Divest Harvard statement said. It also noted that Bacow said the University must use its scholarship to address climate change and that Murtagh told students that Harvard has various environmental, social, and corporate governance guidelines that dictate their investment strategy.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the administrators “appreciated” Wednesday’s conversation.
“Bacow, Lee and Murtagh appreciated the thoughtful exchange of perspectives and the opportunity to continue the conversation with members of Divest Harvard,” Swain wrote.
Divest Harvard spokesperson Caleb D. Schwartz ’20, an inactive Crimson editor, declined to comment on the meeting, referring The Crimson to the group’s public statement.
Divest Harvard provided an account of the various issues discussed at the meeting, including students’ own experiences with climate change and the group’s demands. The account also includes the group's assertion that Harvard’s recent efforts to address climate change by means besides divestment are insufficient. In late September, Harvard announced its commitment to join Climate Action 100+, a group of investors who have signed on to reduce their emissions.
Divest members wrote in their statement, however, that they find this insufficient.
“Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard believes that the slow-paced shareholder engagement initiatives touted by the University are not only insufficient in addressing the climate crisis, but a harmful option that will distract from necessary climate action,” the statement reads.
Gabrielle T. Langkilde ’21, one student in attendance, told administrators how climate change impacts her life as a citizen of American Samoa — which is threatened by rising sea levels — and why that pushes her to call for divestment, according to the statement.
Divest Harvard has staged several demonstrations already this semester to bring attention to their cause. The group held a protest earlier this week regarding the University’s ownership of Brazilian land and led Harvard affiliates during the global climate strike in September.
Divest Harvard member Eva K. Rosenfeld ’21, a Crimson magazine editor, closed the conversation, arguing that Harvard will soon “lose its opportunity to be on the right side of history on the issue of climate change,” according to the statement.

Heath P. Tarbert, chairman and chief executive of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, spoke about rules-based and principles-based financial regulations during the Institute of Politics’s annual Robert Glauber Lecture Thursday at the John F. Kennedy Forum.
Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Robert R. Glauber moderated the talk, which was open to the public and drew roughly 50 people. He introduced Tarbert as a prime example of someone involved in both the private and public sectors.
“Heath’s career which spans private practice as a lawyer and public service in a number of senior financial policy and regulatory positions is really a paradigm career path for our graduates,” Glauber said.
Tarbert stated that the mission of the CFTC is to “promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy” of the American derivatives markets. He added that the organization strives to set the “global standard for sound derivatives regulation.”
Tarbert said he defines sound regulation as “using the right tools, at the right time, for the right reasons.”
During the talk, Tarbert introduced and analogized principles-based and rules-based regulation to speed limit signs. He said that principles-based regulation is similar to a sign reading “Please drive with care” — which focuses on generality — whereas rules-based regulation is similar to a sign with an exact speed limit value — which employs strict, quantitative methodology.
Tarbert added that though these two ideologies are sometimes considered to be opposing, he believes it is possible to reconcile both sides and employ a hybrid form of regulation.
To demonstrate the impact of sound regulation, Tarbert asked the audience to identify which regulatory approach to use in specific real-world applications.
“Unless we take the time to really think about it — what should we use — we could end up spending a lot of time on things that could be ineffective,” Tarbert said.
As he concluded his talk, Tarbert referred to the belief of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy ’40 that one should pursue not the Republican or the Democratic solution, but the right answer.
“I hope today that by at least articulating some principles for rules, and some rules for principles, I’ve at least gone a step in the right direction to focusing on that right answer, and I hope that in so doing, I’ve perhaps shed a little light in making a little sense of financial regulation,” Tarbert said.
Some of the attendees said they were interested in the talk because they seek to pursue careers in the finance sector.
“I closely follow financial regulation,” attendee Miles Neumann ’20 said. “I think it’s an extremely interesting space considering the broader effects it has on global capital markets.”
“It was interesting to hear the sort of almost psychological framework behind how these rule-makers come to these specific pieces of legislation,” attendee Zachary U. Buttenwieser ’20 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A national sexual misconduct climate survey administered to universities across the country earlier this year revealed that most schools did not see a significant change in the prevalence of sexual assault compared with incident rates four years ago, according to the results released earlier this month.
The American Association of Universities survey found that among similarly sized peer institutions, Harvard’s rate of sexual misconduct tended toward average.
Harvard’s prevalence rate of “nonconsensual sexual contact” for undergraduate women was within a percentage point of both Stanford’s and Brown’s. Harvard and Stanford both saw rates of roughly 33 percent, while Brown’s rate is 34 percent. Yale’s rate is higher at 39 percent, while MIT’s is lower at 27 percent.
Harvard’s prevalence of harassment also falls within a similar range as peer institutions. Its rate — 17 percent — was slightly lower than that of Stanford, Yale, and Brown; MIT reported less harassment than Harvard, at 16 percent. All of the school’s harassment rates were within eight percentage points of each other.
The schools varied more in their students’ reported knowledge of their campus’s definition of sexual misconduct, but overall, reported knowledge was higher than it had been during the survey’s first iteration in 2015. Brown students reported the least confidence in their knowledge at 29 percent, though still saw an increase from 18.4 percent in 2015. Yale students had the highest reported rate, at 40 percent. At Harvard, 34 percent of students said they were very or extremely knowledgeable about how Harvard defines sexual assault and other misconduct — up from the 14.5 percent reported in 2015.
The majority of respondents at each school who experienced sexual misconduct noted that they did not report the misconduct because they thought the harassment was not serious enough or that they could handle the situation themselves.
While there was alignment between schools in many respects, response rates varied widely across institutions. Stanford — which had the second-highest response rate among all participating institutions — saw a response rate of 62 percent. Stanford students were offered a $20 incentive to complete the survey. In comparison, Harvard’s response rate was 36 percent; Yale reported a 45 percent response rate, MIT reported 40 percent, and Brown reported 31.5 percent.
Harvard’s responses were roughly average across the entire survey group AAU, however.
“The results provide cause for both hope and continued concern,” AAU President Mary Sue Coleman wrote in a press release. “They reveal that, while students know more about university-sponsored resources for victims of sexual assault and misconduct, they still aren’t using these resources often enough.”
Following the release of the survey’s results, administrators across the various universities have said they will make changes to reduce incidents of sexual misconduct on campus.
Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard will continue to lead conversations with other schools in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Action Collaborative — an ongoing initiative which Harvard helped to found, and will continue to work with in order to best apply the AAU survey’s findings.
“We are also working closely with our Ivy Plus peers on establishing, and sharing, best practice in prevention,” Merhill wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 defended in a Thursday interview Harvard’s position on controversial proposals in Harvard’s negotiation process with its graduate student union.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers announced two weeks ago that it would hold a strike authorization vote to enable its bargaining committee to call a strike if it deems necessary. The vote is set to wrap up Friday, according to a Tuesday email HGSU bargaining committee member Jennifer K. Austiff sent to members and would require two-thirds of voters’ support to pass.
Garber said the University does not believe a strike is justified.
“We don't think that there is any reason for a strike when we're in the midst of negotiations that are happening in a very serious way,” Garber said.
“It’s the right of the union to pursue a strike authorization vote, and we respect that,” Garber added.
Garber also said it would be “premature” to specify the measures the University plans to take in the event of a strike, but noted that Harvard is looking at other universities’ historic responses to strikes.
“We do need to take various kinds of precautions and have learned from the experiences of the other universities,” he said.
Garber also defended Harvard’s position on much-debated proposals between the union and the University including health insurance, protections against discrimination and harassment, and compensation.
HGSU and the University remain at an impasse regarding the union’s sexual harassment and nondiscrimination proposal. The union's version would give members the option to address discrimination and sexual harassment complaints using a third-party grievance procedure outside of Harvard’s normal adjudication methods.
Garber said that protections against discrimination and harassment are a “top priority for the University,” but that he is not supportive of the union proposal’s “fairly narrow process” that would only apply to a small portion of the University’s members.
“We are not going to commit our approach to these high priority issues to just a narrow segment of the population,” Garber said. “We’re committed to improving everything we do about Title IX and non-discrimination, and we have a committee — the Title IX policy review committee — that will be continuously reviewing our TItle IX policies with an aim to improving them."
The two sides still have not come to agreement on compensation and health benefits either. HGSU’s healthcare proposal includes paid dependent health care, dental coverage, and increased coverage for specialist and mental health care visits.
Garber noted that the two sides have a “difference of approach” to changing the insurance plan. HGSU’s proposal would only apply to student workers, not other students, he said.
“If there is a good idea that should be implemented, we want to implement it broadly,” Garber said. “Carving out a separate health insurance plan just for the time that people are in the union...is not feasible, nor is it the best way to deliver effective health care.”
He also said it would be difficult to implement changes through HGSU's contract because student workers do not necessarily “serve continuously" in roles that allow them to be eligible for HGSU membership.
“It's simply not feasible to have one health insurance plan one semester and a different health insurance plan another semester,” Garber said.
Garber added that the union has requested “much greater increases” than the University’s most recent proposal on compensation.
“The compensation proposal that we last put forward is more generous than what the UAW has secured in other negotiations with universities recently,” he said.
Harvard and HGSU recently entered the second year of negotiations for their first contract. HGSU bargaining committee member Hector F. Medina-Abarca wrote in an emailed statement that the union was frustrated by the lack of progress in key contract provisions.
“For over a year of negotiations, our union has called for fair pay, comprehensive and affordable healthcare, and protections against discrimination and harassment,” Medina-Abarca wrote. “In response, the University is proposing pay raises that are lower than current practice in many departments; refusing to bargain over our health care plan; and insisting on denying student workers protections against harassment that every other union employee at Harvard has.”
The next bargaining session between HGSU and Harvard is scheduled to take place on Oct. 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of researchers from the Broad Institute led by professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology David R. Liu ’94 developed a novel gene-editing technique called “prime editing.”
The technique, published in the scientific journal Nature on Monday, could “correct about 89% of known pathogenic human genetic variants,” with broad applications in the field of medicine, according to Nature.
Liu and his team’s research has captured the attention of scientists and experts in the field.
Harvard Medical School genetics Professor George M. Church wrote in an email that the research from Liu’s lab has made significant progress from previous gene-editing technologies.
“This prime-editing method is much, much closer to the grail of unlimited and precise edits than any simple nuclease,” Church wrote.
The technique could have larger implications on the field of gene editing, according to Fyodor Urnov, a biology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and scientific director at the Innovative Genomics Institute.
“I think it could become a tool of major impact in the arsenal that gene editors have to engineer the cell and organism,” Urnov said.
Still, the field of gene editing continues to face ethical questions. The technology could be used to enhance human performance, according to Urnov.
Prime editing implements a search-and-replace tactic that “is capable of directly editing human cells in a precise, efficient, and highly versatile fashion,” according to a Broad Institute press release. This allows scientists to create all possible types of point mutations, insertions, and deletions, whereas prior iterations of gene-editing technologies did not have this capability.
“If CRISPR-Cas9 and other programmable nucleases are like scissors, and base editors are like pencils, then prime editors are like word processors, capable of searching for target DNA sequences and precisely replacing them with edited DNA sequences,” Liu wrote in an email.
Currently, there are few viable treatments for rare genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Prime editing could potentially contribute to treatments for these diseases, according to Urnov.
Andrew V. Anzalone, a postdoctoral fellow and first author on the paper, said the lab has used their new technique to edit mammalian cells in a petri dish.
This capability has applications in the field of therapeutics, as researchers can study effects of “changes to genes” or model “biological pathways,” according to Anzalone.
Liu wrote that the ultimate goal of gene editing is “to be able to make any DNA change, in any position of a living cell or organism, including human patients with genetic diseases.”
“Much more work is needed to fully realize this goal,” he wrote.
The development of this technique comes at a time when the Broad Institute is involved in a separate dispute over CRISPR Cas9 patent rights with UC Berkeley, which alleges that the Broad used “deceit” to win patent rights to CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign hosted “Free-Them Week” this week to promote prison divestment at the University through a series of seminars, office hours, and workshops.
HPDC launched the week’s events by delivering a 64-page report — released last Wednesday — detailing what they say are the University’s investments in companies with ties to the prison industry to Massachusetts Hall Monday.
The report estimated the University has at least $3 million invested in companies with such ties. It also demanded the University divest and disclose all endowment holdings in companies connected to the industry.
On Wednesday night, students gathered at Harvard Law School for a seminar about connecting Jewish values to calls for divestment and dismantling the U.S. prison system. Participants drew parallels between contemporary prisons and the historic confinement of Jewish people as a basis for solidarity.
Event organizer and graduate student Gabriel L. Schwartz said he feels that Jews had a “moral obligation” to protest racism in the prison industry.
“Our faith as Jews is deeply wrapped up in the fate of other marginalized people in the United States,” he said. “Anti-semitism and anti-black racism are historically and concurrently intertwined.”
The following day, Law School graduate Derecka M. Purnell led a workshop about prison abolition, during which she described divestment as a “tenet” of abolition.
“What these student organizers are trying to do is get Harvard to remove some of its billions of dollars from profiting off the caging of human beings,” she said in an interview after the event. “There are so many other things to invest in. The fact that they are committed to investing and profiting from the caging of human beings is immoral.”
The week’s events also included a seminar about socially responsible investing, a session about restoring the right to vote for prisoners in Massachusetts, and office hours for people to learn more about prison divestment and abolition. The last event, planned for Friday, will feature an immigrant who spent time in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement prison.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referenced previous comments in response to calls for the University to divest from companies with ties to the prison industry.
“[University] President [Lawrence S.] Bacow has met with advocates for prison divestment,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement. “He has also invited them to meet with members of the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility and looks forward to further discussion.”
HPDC is scheduled to meet with Bacow and the Corporation’s Committee on Shareholder Responsibility Oct. 28. The CCSR is a subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — that advises the University on matters related to social responsibility in its investment decisions.
HPDC organizer and Law School student Anna L. Nathanson said HPDC is committed to prison divestment for the “long haul.”
“We'll have to see how the meeting goes on Monday,” she said. “The ball is really going to be in the court of Lawrence Bacow and the rest of the administration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to rankings, Harvard just can’t seem to outscore Princeton. There’s the oft-cited U.S. News National University Rankings, which the Tigers have sat atop the past eight years (Harvard coming in at a measly second place). You’ve got your pre-season Ivy League football power rankings, where the Crimson fell just below Princeton’s third-place start. Harvard even loses when it comes to food – the Tigers’ dining services beat HUDS by over 200 spots (though I’m not sure how a school without Red’s Best Catch even clawed its way out of the top 500). However, the Harvard football team is hoping to change that narrative in this weekend’s battle on the gridiron.
“Princeton’s a very good team — they’re obviously scoring a lot of points out there,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “But at the end of the day, every game we go into is a game we believe we can win. This weekend is no exception.”
Coach Murphy’s optimistic outlook may not be enough to cage the undefeated Tigers, who haven’t lost a game since 2017. The Powers Field-powerhouse outscored their opponents by a margin of 340 points last season; however, last year’s battle against the Crimson was certainly a speed bump on Princeton’s road to the Ancient Eight title. Though Harvard ended up losing to the Tigers by a touchdown, the Crimson defense ensured that Princeton was never ahead by more than two possessions.
“It's definitely a sour taste in our mouth,” said Harvard quarterback Jake Smith on last year’s loss to the Tigers. “We're looking forward to getting back on the field and showing them how we started this team.”
The Crimson is currently riding a win streak of its own. The squad leads the nation in sacks, blocked kicks, and blocked punts, its most recent win coming in a 31-21 crusade against Holy Cross last Saturday. Coach Murphy cites his team as being “much improved” since the last time it took on the Tigers, a sentiment that many players seem to echo.
“We’re looking forward to this weekend’s challenge,” said Crimson running back B.J. Watson. “[Princeton has] a great defense that we’re going to face, and we have a great offense, but we also have a great defense of our own, and they have a great offense. It’s really going to be fight — it’s going to be a battle.”
As the trend goes, Princeton leads Harvard in scoring offense this season — the Tigers are ranked first in the Ivy League and second nationally to the Crimson’s second and 10th-place standings, respectively. Quarterback Kevin Davidson has truly taken the Tigers’ reins, the California native leading the FCS in both passing efficiency and completion percentage.
Even more prominent for Princeton this season has been the team’s game on the ground. A trio of top running backs have propelled the Tigers to offensive dominance, with junior Collin Eaddy coming in at sixth in the country in scoring.
“[Eaddy] is a speed guy and a big guy — he’s a little bit like our DeMarkas Stratford but bigger,” Murphy said. “He’s a guy you’d better focus on and contain because he’s an elite track athlete and can take it to the house on any snap.”
Though Harvard’s defense may have its hands full, the Crimson’s special teams squad is hoping to maintain its punt-blocking prepotency. Harvard has blocked five of 34 attempted punts this season, adding yet another first-place statistic to the team’s national repertoire.
On the other side of the pigskin, Harvard will certainly have the tiger by the tail in taking on the Princeton defense, the Tigers second only to the Crimson itself in sacks per game.
“We're expecting to see an athletic defense out there on the field,” Watson said. “Their defense is pretty straightforward, but they're a fast and physical football team that's going to come out there and go until the last whistle.”
Aside from the potential of snapping Princeton’s win streak, Harvard has a few records of its own that the team is coming closer and closer to breaking. Smith is a mere eleven touchdowns shy of breaking the squad’s single-season touchdown record, and Murphy is only two wins away from beating out Yale’s Carmen Cozza for most total wins in Ancient Eight history.
“That’s just a testament to how great Coach Murphy is as a coach,” Watson said. “We don’t ever really look into statistics — we’re all about wins and losses. The fact that he has so many of those just shows how great he is. Hopefully, we’re going to go out there and get those wins for him.”

MEN’S TENNIS
It is hard enough to match up against some of the best tennis players in the country and perform at an elite level, but it is even harder when the conditions for playing are windy, rainy, and close to freezing. But these challenging conditions barely slowed down Harvard’s men’s tennis team this past weekend at the ITA Northeast Regionals at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pa.
The Crimson were led by two first-years, Ronan Jachuck and Henry von der Schulenberg, who advanced to the semifinals and quarterfinals of the tournament, respectively. Injuries to some athletes and a few logistical issues resulted in only the pair of first-years staying for the entire weekend.
The erratic weather made the tournament quite difficult, as matches each day alternated between being indoors and outdoors, depending on the conditions of the day. Jachuck mentioned that although conditions were far from ideal, he was still able to find his groove.
“The first day was difficult because it was really the first time hitting the courts [at Penn], and it was tough to get my rhythm in the first match,” the first-year said. “Once I got through that, though, I started to feel pretty good and had two matches on the second day. After that, I was matched up and ready to go, which led to my best match on Monday.”
The Crimson athlete squared up against a familiar opponent, Princeton sophomore Karl Poling, who he had known and played against at tournaments in New York since he was around 11 years old. It was this sense of familiarity that made Jachuck even more locked-in and ready to go. He defeated Poling in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
The other Harvard first-year, von der Schulenberg, won his first three matches against athletes from Buffalo, Princeton, and Columbia, eventually advancing to the quarterfinals before falling to Dartmouth senior Charlie Broom, 7-6(5), 6-2.
In the semifinals this past Tuesday, Jachuck faced off against a Columbia senior, Jackie Tang, but eventually lost after a long battle, 6-4, 7-6.
Jachuck noted that the team’s camaraderie and mindset has grown tremendously since the start of the year.
“I think in practice we all compete really well; we all have similar levels,” Jachuck said. “When some of us have success, like this past weekend, it’s really good to see and we all really like to push each other in that way.”
Although it has been the first-years who have stepped up and capitalized on their opportunities so far this year, everyone on the team, Jachuck says, has been a leader because of the high standards they hold each other to and the mutual respect they have for one another.
Next up for the Harvard men is Chowder Fest, the final tournament of the fall season, held at home in Cambridge starting on Nov. 8.
WOMEN’S TENNIS
The Crimson women’s tennis team also competed this past weekend at the ITA Northeast Regionals at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., led by the trio of senior captain Natasha Gonzalez, sophomore Rachel Lim, and first-year Mihaela Marculescu.
Gonzalez and Lim competed together in doubles throughout the weekend, beating teams from Brown, UMass Amherst, and Boston University 8-6, 8-4, and 8-6, respectively. The duo then faced off against another pair from Columbia in the quarterfinals, eventually being eliminated 8-2.
Marculescu noted that the quarterfinal performance, in particular, was incredible to watch, as it was the first time this season that Gonzalez and Lim competed in doubles together. Marculescu, who hails from Romania, competed twice in singles herself, defeating Columbia first-year Michelle Xu 6-1, 6-1, before falling to Yale junior Caroline Dunleavy 6-3, 6-3.
Marculescu made sure to mention that although the level of play at the tournaments has been quite high and she has been challenged greatly, her overall transition to playing in college has been fantastic.
”I’m not used to having so many people supporting me, but [Gonzalez, Lim and the coaches] helped so much,” said Marculescu of her showdown with the Columbia athlete. “I managed to play at my best, and that match went really well for me.”
Marculescu also noted that the team has already grown significantly this year, as they have developed their support network and increased their respect for each other. These qualities have allowed the players to flourish and become forces to be reckoned with.
The Harvard women are close to wrapping up their fall season, with one final tournament at home on Nov. 1 for the Harvard Invitational. The team looks to continue its success, and if they continue their upward trajectory, success seems to be well within reach.

Sure, it’s ~spooky season~, but have you taken a chance to open your own closet and inspect the skeletons in there? There may be some real ghosts from your past following you around, so take a look at some of the most common ghosts around, and beware.
The Ghost of Your Freshman Year Annenberg Crush 
The last time you saw them in the flesh may have been three years ago, but from time to time you find yourself thinking about their distant memory. You may not remember their name or the house they’re in now, but this spooky season may be the best time to revisit this ghost.
The Ghost of The Cup You Took From the Dhall 
Maybe you recently received a passive-aggressive email from your resident dean complaining about the critically low levels of cups in the dhall, which got you thinking about the cups you have lined up on your bookshelf. It may be time to bring them back to the dhall and free yourself from the guilt.
The Ghost of the Lecture(s) You Slept Through 
Your head can be seen bobbing up and down in lecture. But, hey, it’s not your fault that this 12 p.m. class disrupts your sleep schedule. When it comes to the midterm and psets, though, missing those lectures has you spooked. This ghost is truly out to get you.
The Ghost of the Readings You Didn’t Do 
The introductions and conclusions to all the papers you read for your class are interesting, but too bad you never read in between. Yet, you manage to make some great points in class and participate in your discussion about Greek heroes and ethics in technology. Regardless, the ghosts of these readings are out to get you, and might just catch up come the midterm.
The Ghost of The Person You Ghosted 
By far the scariest ghost of all. You never replied to their last message and the possibilities are haunting you. Maybe it could’ve been great, or maybe your gut was right and the vibes were just a bit off. If this person comes back to haunt you, be careful.
Who knew there were so many ghosts around? Stay on high alert this spooky season and be sure to be on the lookout for the Harvard ghosts that are haunting you.
