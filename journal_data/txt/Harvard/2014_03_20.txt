After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
SPOKANE, Wash.—With the Harvard men’s basketball team gearing up for its first NCAA Tournament matchup of 2014 against the favored Cincinnati Bearcats here Thursday afternoon, a number of fans and support groups have made the cross-country trek to support the Crimson, and many more are planning to take in the game at viewing parties scheduled at locations in Cambridge and across the country.
Of those cities selected to host NCAA regional games, Spokane was by far the most distant in which the Crimson could have been placed. But by Wednesday afternoon, the Harvard Varsity Club had already sold out its 250-ticket allotment, according to Jennifer C. Flynn, director of clubs and shared interest groups for the Harvard Alumni Association. Flynn added that her office has been fielding additional requests for tickets, which are available now on the re-sale market.
Harvard affiliates across the country who cannot make the trip to Spokane are planning to host viewing parties for Thursday’s game, which is set to begin at 2:10 p.m. EST. Official parties will take place at John Harvard’s Brew House in Cambridge, at the Harvard Club of Boston, at Choppers Sports Grill in Denver, and at a still-to-be-determined location in Cincinnati, Ohio.
But in Spokane, Harvard supporters have been gathering for two days. About 300 fans, many of them wearing Harvard apparel, turned out for the team’s open practice at the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena on Wednesday. After the practice concluded, the team gathered at center court to salute the fans in attendance and players stopped to sign autographs while exiting the court.
Also in attendance at Wednesday’s open practice were the Harvard Cheerleaders and members of the University Band, the two main support groups that will be featured during Thursday’s game. Last year, when the Crimson upset the heavily-favored New Mexico Lobos and advanced to the tournament’s second round, the members of the band, their uniforms, and their expressive celebrations drew national media attention.
“Some of our freshman definitely arrived [to the band] after seeing that picture,” said band-member Theo J. Gerome ’15. Gerome added that the NCAA tournament is one of the band’s most anticipated events of the year. Due to NCAA regulations, only 30 of the band’s roughly 65 members can play at the tournament, he said.
For the cheerleaders, who next month head to a national collegiate cheerleading competition in Daytona Beach, Florida, the NCAA tournament is as much an opportunity for pressure and exposure as anything else.
“It’s definitely really amazing to see so many people out there, but it’s also really great for us because we go to a national competition where there are a lot more people than are usually in Lavietes, so I think it’s really great exposure,” said cheer co-captain Jaquell G. Sneed-Adams ’14.
Each morning in Spokane, the band and cheerleaders have come together to form a tunnel of cheers and music outside the basketball team’s hotel. The group will gather for another send-off on Thursday morning as the Crimson aim to beat the odds once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—On Thursday afternoon (2:10 EST, TNT), the Harvard men’s basketball team will take on the Cincinnati Bearcats in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. In Part I of a two-part preview, staff writer David Freed looks at Cincinnati’s tournament profile and whether its style of play increases the likelihood of a Harvard upset.
 
Quick Primer on Cincinnati:
Record: 27-6 (15-3 American Athletic Conference)
Best Wins: Pittsburgh, Memphis (twice), UConn, Louisville
Worst Losses: Xavier, SMU
RPI: 13
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 25
Star Players: Sean Kilpatrick (Sr. Guard) 20.7 ppg, 2.6 apg; Justin Jackson (Sr. Center) 11.1 ppg, 7.2 rpg
Common Opponents:
Harvard and Cincinnati shared just one common opponent all year: the Connecticut Huskies. With Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders out with injury, Harvard was outscored by 10 points in the second half, and fell to the Huskies, 61-56, at Gampel Pavilion on Jan. 8. The Bearcats beat the Huskies at home by five in their first meeting behind Kilpatrick’s 26 points and season-high 12 rebounds, but lost a rematch on the road, 51-45, and in the AAC tournament, 58-56.
However, the two teams attacked UConn in very different ways. In its lone win, the Bearcats dominated the Huskies inside behind 15 points from Jackson. The Crimson instead used its spacing to frustrate UConn’s defense, knocking down nine threes to compensate for the lack of a true slasher on the floor in Saunders’ absence. On defense, both units managed to keep Naismith Award finalist Shabazz Napier in check, and UConn did not clear 44 percent shooting in any of the four matchups.
Style of Play: 
This year’s Cincinnati squad fits perfectly into the mold created by coach Mick Cronin. The Bearcats are a tenacious defensive team (seventh nationally in defensive efficiency) that gets after opposing ball handlers, forcing turnovers on nearly 23 percent of opponent possessions. Jackson anchors the team inside, leading Cincinnati in both blocks and steals, while Kilpatrick leads a strong group of perimeter wings. Although no starter is taller than 6’8”, the Bearcats do an excellent job of using their length to run opponents off the three-point line and funnel would-be drivers to a waiting Jackson inside.
On offense, Kilpatrick and Jackson are the squad’s two leading scorers, although it might be more accurate to say that the senior guard is Cincinnati’s first, second, and third option. Kilpatrick, who has played nearly 200 more minutes and hoisted 207 more shots than any of his teammates, has scored more points in a Bearcat uniform than anybody but Oscar Robertson. The team goes as he goes, especially with Jackson being foul-prone.
Upset Potential:
Last week, I ranked eight possible Crimson first-round opponents in five categories—three-point shooting frequency, three-point shooting frequency allowed, defensive rebounding percentage, offensive rebounding percentage, and opponent turnover percentage—to judge Harvard’s chances of an upset. Here is where Cincinnati fits in, with its national rank (out of 351) in parentheses:
OREB%: 38.1% (8)
DREB%: 70.8% (165)
Op. TO%: 21.8 (12)
3P Freq.: 31.2% (213)
Op. 3P Freq.: 32.4% (159)
 
By these metrics, Cincinnati grades out as a very good first-round “Giant.” The Bearcats rebound a large percentage of their own misses, force a lot of turnovers, and run opponents off of the three-point line. Its excellence in the first two categories gives it many extra possessions, helping to make up for its significantly below average offense—and, since extra possessions mean extra chances for superior talent to shine, reducing the chance of being upset. Forcing opponents off the three-point line, a big underdog equalizer, makes the Bearcats an even safer favorite.
 
Unfortunately for Cincinnati, it could not have asked for a much worse first-round matchup in that respect. On the defensive end, Harvard grabs 74.8 percent of all available rebounds, good for 20th nationally. On offense, Harvard’s 39.0 percent three-point shooting is 39th best in the country, and it turns the ball over on just 15 percent of its plays.
Since the strengths of the squads will go head to head, whichever team can exert its will will have the upper hand. The Bearcats like to use opponent’s turnovers to jumpstart fast breaks, while the Crimson plays more deliberately on offense, often running sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers off multiple pick-and-rolls to find the best shot available.
Another crucial factor could be Harvard’s willingness to take threes against a Bearcat defense designed to take them away. The Crimson shoots threes on a way-below-average 28 percent of possessions, but upped that number to 43 percent against New Mexico in last year’s NCAA Tournament. For Amaker’s squad to pull off the upset once more, it will need to effectively use the triple against a feisty Cincinnati unit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
SPOKANE, Wash.—“We gon make them respect us.”
 
Those six words were tweeted by Cincinnati senior forward Titus Rubles last Sunday, just after it was announced that his men’s basketball team would face Harvard in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
 
He was speaking to the likes of Seth Davis and Doug Gottlieb, CBS analysts who predicted on Selection Sunday that the Crimson, at the No. 12 seed, would upset its fifth-seeded Bearcat opponents.
 
“I'm an Ivy guy and would love to see Harvard win a game, but it's not happening. They have no chance against New Mexico. Awful draw for them.”
 
Those were the sentences tweeted by Sports Illustrated writer Andy Glockner before to the 2013 Big Dance. Glockner’s words, of course, turned out to be anything but prescient—the Crimson beat New Mexico, 68-62, busting brackets and propelling Harvard into the national spotlight.
 
Clearly, something has changed.
 
Ever since Harvard upset the Lobos and advanced to the third round of the Tournament, there has been an increased focus on and fascination with the Crimson around the nation. The New York Times, Slam Magazine and SBNation have all written features on the team, and for many, Harvard’s No. 12 seed takes away nothing from its ability to take down Cincinnati on Thursday.
 
In other words, “no chance” has become “no doubt” for Harvard fans. Getting an invite to the Big Dance is now expected—getting a victory in the Tourney is now the real test of success.
 
This upward trend in expectations perhaps reached its pinnacle on Wednesday morning as President Barack Obama released his own bracket in which he predicted that the Crimson will sneak by the Bearcats and advance to the Round of 32.
 
“I think that’s pretty cool that he picked us,” said Harvard co-captain Laurent Rivard at Wednesday’s press conference in Spokane. “He probably took notice [of us] last year, he probably didn’t pick us last year [though].”
 
But it wasn’t just the experts that picked the Crimson to advance. According to ESPN, of the 6.97 million brackets that had been submitted to ESPN’s Tournament Challenge by Wednesday, 30.5 percent predicted a Harvard upset.
 
“I think [our program] is getting recognition, I think we have been able to attain a level of credibility with our basketball program,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said on Wednesday. “[But] we have always talked about [‘expectations’] being an external word and we are trusting our guys that we’re always going to focus on our internal word, which is the word standards. And that’s what we have done.”
 
While these expectations have brought increased media attention to the Crimson, so too have they brought increased pressure. The abundance of people—expert or not—picking the underdogs t has led to the Ohio team claiming it needs to prove it can win and, as Rubles said, “make” others “respect” the Bearcats.
 
When told of the President’s pick, neither of the Cincinnati co-captains, guard Sean Kilpatrick and forward Justin Jackson, showed any surprise.
 
“It’s nothing new, we’re used to it,” Kilpatrick said Wednesday. “We’re so used to being counted out throughout the regular season that now it’s something that [is] second nature…. We can only just really focus on what matters with us and the team in the locker room. We have been counted out all year and look how far we have gotten now.”
 
When the squads take the floor on Thursday, the typical roles of a second-round Tournament game will be reversed. The fifth-seeded team will come out with something to prove, perceiving themselves to be the underdog. The No. 12 seed, however, will step onto the hardwood looking to validate its hype and match the level of basketball it played in last year’s Dance.
 In what will be one of the first games of the second round, it appears that this matchup will already show the madness so typical of March college basketball.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—On Thursday afternoon (2:10 EST, TNT), the Harvard men’s basketball team will take on the Cincinnati Bearcats in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. In part II of his two-part preview, staff writer David Freed looks at the individual matchups of the competing squads.
Point Guard: Ge’Lawn Guyn v. Siyani Chambers:
After being the first guard off the bench for two consecutive years, Guyn has started every game for the Bearcats this year. Like the rest of the Cincinnati backcourt, Guyn is a feisty defender, who ranked fourth on the team in steals during the regular season. His offensive game, like most of his fellow Wildcats, can’t hold a candle to his defensive effort, but he has improved his three-point shooting efficiency in each campaign (31.5 percent in 2013-2014).
Although Guyn has already defended the likes of Louisville’s Russ Smith and UConn’s Shabazz Napier and Ryan Boatright in conference play, Chambers is a different matchup as he is more of a facilitator than a score-first point guard. The 6’2” Guyn will need to use his length to bother the generously listed 6’0” Chambers and disrupt the pick-and-rolls that the Crimson love to run with its sophomore point guard.
Shooting Guard: Sean Kilpatrick v. Wesley Saunders:
This is definitely the matchup to keep your eye on heading into the game. Kilpatrick, the Bearcats’ leading scorer at 20.7 points per contest, is a finalist for the Naismith Award. Like Saunders, who was named Ivy League Player of the Year, Kilpatrick logs big minutes (nearly 34 per game) while leading his team on both ends of the floor. The tenacious fifth-year senior is an excellent individual defender who Cronin counts on to lead the Cincy offense.
Saunders doesn’t take nearly the volume of shots that Kilpatrick—who takes 27 percent of his team’s field goal attempts and 29 percent of its free throws—does, but he is a similarly large cog in a balanced Crimson attack. Coach Tommy Amaker counts on Saunders to defend the opponent’s best perimeter player while creating for both himself (14.0 points per game) and others (4.7 assists per game) on the other end.
Both teams’ hopes rest on their respective stars being able to shut down the other while continuing to contribute on the offensive end. Harvard and Cincinnati are just 11-8 when their stars make less than 35 percent of their shots, and a combined 42-2 otherwise.
Small Forward: Shaquille Thomas v. Laurent Rivard:
The two small forwards could not be more different. Thomas clawed his way into the starting lineup after playing single-digit minutes in six of eight contests in the middle of the season; Rivard has been an established starter since his freshman year. Thomas makes his living inside, crashing the offensive glass, while Rivard prefers to hang around the perimeter and make opponents pay for leaving him open behind the arc.
The way this matchup swings could be a huge factor in the game. If Thomas and Cincinnati cannot impose themselves inside, they will struggle to score against a good cadre of Crimson perimeter defenders. Likewise, if Rivard cannot shake Thomas, Harvard will lose a crucial dimension of its offense.
Power Forward: Titus Rubles v. Steve Moundou-Missi
One of Cincinnati’s three starting seniors, Rubles does a little bit of everything for the Bearcats. Although he is not a great shooter at 40 percent from the field, Rubles pulls down almost seven rebounds a game, chipping in two assists, one block, and a steal per contest to boot.
He will be asked to defend Harvard’s most polished post presence in Moundou-Missi, who has developed into a double-digit scorer in his third year. The Yaoundé, Cameroon native shot a career-high 54.4 percent from the field this season, while playing exceptional weak-side defense. The junior’s ability to establish himself inside early will be crucial as Harvard tries to implement its inside-out attack.
Center: Justin Jackson v. Kyle Casey
The senior Jackson has been a revelation for the Bearcats, leading the team in rebounds, blocks, steals, and field goal percentage. Although he shoots a putrid 46 percent from the line, Jackson’s activity on the offensive glass (3.1 offensive rebounds per game) gets him to the free-throw stripe early and often. The foul-prone Casey, an excellent defensive rebounder, will need to be careful to body up Jackson without drawing excessive contact, something he has struggled with this year.
Both players are their team’s primary rim protectors and it will be up to Casey, the better shooter of the two, to force Jackson away from the basket in order to open up the court for his teammates. As Casey is the only Crimson player who is Jackson’s athletic equal, he will have to limit his fouls to give Harvard a chance to shut down the Bearcat senior inside.
Bench:
Unlike last year when Amaker used a seven-man rotation to beat New Mexico, Harvard has a deep and flexible bench. Co-captain Brandyn Curry and sophomore Agunwa Okolie give Harvard guard and wing depth, respectively, that it did not have last season. Junior Jonah Travis, sophomore Evan Cummins, and freshman Zena Edosomwan offer Amaker versatility in the frontcourt.
While Amaker uses his bench to create a deep front line, Cincinnati coach Mick Cronin utilizes the second unit to give his offense more range and floor spacing. Troy Caupain, Jermaine Sanders, and Kevin Johnson, three of the team’s top four reserves, collectively take 49 percent of their shots from deep. If the trio can knock down a couple of triples, it will help keep the Crimson defense honest and continue to open up driving lanes for the slashing Kilpatrick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—“Relief” was the word sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers used to describe the feeling for the Harvard men’s basketball team (26-4, 13-1 Ivy) after it wrapped up its fourth consecutive Ivy League title. The exhausting work of meeting expectations was over.
Now, as it enters its opening game in the NCAA tournament Thursday afternoon against Cincinnati (27-6, 15-3 American Athletic Conference), Harvard has a chance to re-assume the exciting identity of the underdog—and relief has given way to a different feeling.
“It’s replaced by a newly-found hunger,” Chambers said. “We’re trying to go out here and get a victory. So we have to go like we were chasing the title in the Ivy League, we have to go with the same mentality, the same effort towards getting this victory.”
A season ago, Harvard gave college basketball fans one of the most memorable games of the NCAA Tournament in upsetting heavily favored New Mexico. This year, Harvard’s status as an underdog is not as certain; the Bearcats are favored to win by just 3 points, according to ESPN.com, and several national college basketball analysts picked the Crimson to advance to the Round of 32.
The buzz surrounding Harvard may have caused observers to overlook a very talented Bearcat team. But according to Cincinnati senior guard Sean Kilpatrick, that kind of disregard is something his team has learned to ignore.
“It’s nothing new, we’re used to it,” Kilpatrick said. “We’re so used to being counted out throughout the regular season that now it’s something that’s like second nature towards us. We don’t take it [any] type of way.”
The Bearcats enter Spokane having earned a share of the newly-formed American Athletic Conference’s regular season championship. Cincinnati’s last game came in the semifinal of the AAC Tournament, a 58-56 defeat to Connecticut.
Keying the Bearcats on offense is the first-team All-AAC performer Kilpatrick, who averages 20.7 points per game. Kilpatrick, the second-leading scorer in Cincinnati history, is by far the highest-volume shooter on his team, attempting nearly 15 field goals per game; the next closest is senior forward Justin Jackson, with 8.7.
“I don’t know that you can stop [Kilpatrick], so we’ll do our best, obviously, to see how well we can guard him and defend him,” Amaker said. “It’s going to take a team effort. There’s not one matchup or one person that can be, or will be, responsible for that.”
But offense is not what earned the Bearcats its fifth seed. Cincinnati plays a low-scoring, methodical style, ranking in the bottom 50 in the country in number of possessions per game. Rather, the Bearcats were carried all season by, in Amaker’s words, a “very tough, very physical” defense that complemented that style. Cincinnati has allowed the sixth-fewest points per game in the country this season and the 10th-fewest points per possession. At the heart of that defense is the 6’8” Jackson, who earned AAC Defensive Player of the Year honors after averaging 2.9 blocks per game.
“You look at their team through the years, they have always been known, in my opinion, for a blue collar, tough, hard-nosed brand of basketball,” Amaker said. “So we anticipate that, that’s what we have seen on film.”
UConn was the two teams’ lone common opponent this year; the Crimson lost a tight 61-56 contest in Storrs, while Cincinnati split two regular season meetings before its AAC semifinal loss to the Huskies. But, according to junior guard Wesley Saunders, there is not much to learn from looking at those games.
“It’s obviously different personnel and different matchups on the court,” Saunders said. “I don’t think that them losing to UConn two out of three games really affects our matchup with them. So I think we’re just going into it like it’s our first time playing them, like it is.”
This is no longer the wide-eyed Harvard team that fell to Vanderbilt in the 2012 NCAA Tournament or the relatively inexperienced squad that recorded a stunning upset over New Mexico. At Wednesday’s media conference, the assembled Harvard players projected an assured attitude, aware of the task in front of them but confident of their ability to accomplish it. Simply making the tournament is no longer enough to satisfy the Crimson that it had a successful season; co-captain Brandyn Curry said that the team believes it can advance.
“When we tip it off tomorrow, we’re definitely going to come ready to win,” Curry said. When we get out on the floor, we expect to beat our opponent. And our next opponent is Cincinnati. So that’s our focus, beating them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After posting its best start to a season in nine years, the Harvard women’s tennis team (7-3) headed to California this week for its annual spring break trip.
Coming off a three-week break from action, the No. 37 Crimson split the first two matches of the trip, defeating Cal State Northridge (6-5) but falling to San Diego State (6-9).
“I think we’re doing pretty well,” Harvard freshman June Lee said. “We fought really hard and put in all of our 100 percent effort, which is what matters. I think we’re improving every day and working our way up to the level we want to be at.”
SAN DIEGO STATE 6, HARVARD 1
With one win already under its belt, Harvard could not keep the momentum going at the Aztec Tennis Center Wednesday night.
SDSU set the tone early, grabbing a quick lead with the doubles point. The Aztecs’ pairing of Laura Antonana Iriarte and Isabelle Hoorn defeated Amanda Lin and Amy He, 8-3, while Kristin Buth and Kennedy Davis earned a victory for SDSU by the same score.
The duo of Monica Lin and Spencer Liang, ranked No. 64 in the nation, obtained an 8-6 win on Court One, but by then, the Aztecs had already seized the point.
In singles play, SDSU remained in control, earning four separate wins in straight sets. After playing host to the longest doubles match, Court One held the shortest singles match, as Antonana Iriarte upended Liang, 6-1, 6-1. In addition, Dora Somoracz, Davis, and Hoorn all picked up points for the Aztecs.
“[SDSU’s] players were pretty tricky to play,” Lee said. “They all did something that threw us off a little bit, which I think is good because we’re definitely learning from this. We’ll obviously know what to do in the future when we come across players like [them].”
Crimson freshman Monica Lin served as the lone bright spot of the afternoon, recording a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Buth to remain unbeaten at the second singles position on the year.
“[Monica’s] been playing smart,” Lee said. “She’s been finding the weaknesses in her opponent, staying aggressive, and doing what she normally does, so she’s been doing great.”
Along with Lin, Lee went the distance with her opponent in what proved to be the final match of the night. She won the opening set over Aztec sophomore Tami Nguyen but could not keep it going, as she fell, 6-2, 2-6, 3-6.
“[Nguyen] had a pretty tricky, skiddy serve,” Lee said. “She liked using my pace, and I’m not really used to that.”
HARVARD 6, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 1
 
The Crimson picked up right where it left off prior to the break Tuesday night at Matador Tennis Complex. Harvard took two out of the three doubles matches to earn a point before running away with the contest in singles play.
The pairing of He and Amanda Lin opened the match with an 8-5 victory over Lorraine Cheung and Scout Shutter at the third doubles position. The Matadors, however, came right back, evening the score with an 8-5 win of their own from Mickey Hsu and Kristen Poei against Lee and Morrill.
But in the end, the doubles point went to the Crimson. At the first position, Liang and Monica Lin squeezed past Vivian Lin and Criss Rodriguez, 8-7, to give Harvard an early advantage.
“[CSNU] came out playing pretty strong doubles,” Lee said. “My partner and I lost, but our first position and third position doubles really picked it up.”
In singles action, the match of the afternoon was held on Court One between Liang and Vivian Lin. After dropping the opening set, Liang came back to win the second and then outlasted her opponent in a tiebreak to earn the victory, 5-7, 7-5, 10-8.
Beyond the first court, every other match concluded in just two sets. At second and third singles, Monica Lin and Lee notched wins 6-4, 6-2, and 6-2, 6-4, respectively. He also defeated Poei, 6-0, 6-3, and Lin overcame Jessica Warren, 6-4, 6-1.
The lone point of the day for Cal State was earned by freshman Scout Shutter, who achieved a 6-3, 6-2 victory at the fifth singles position.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—For the Harvard men’s basketball team, winning is becoming a habit—but on Thursday, it never looked easy. In a game in which every inbounds pass, every layup, and every free throw had to be earned, the Crimson did just enough to stave off a hard-charging Cincinnati squad, 61-57.
The victory brings Harvard (27-4, 13-1 Ivy) into the third round of the NCAA Tournament against No. 4-seed Michigan State and sets a program record for wins with 27. Combined with last year’s second-round upset of New Mexico, the Crimson also becomes the first Ivy program to win NCAA Tournament games in consecutive years since Princeton in 1983 and 1984.
Despite the difference in seeding between the two teams, the game promised to be close from the outset, with various betting outlets pegging Cincinnati (27-7, 15-3 American Athletic Conference) as a three-point favorite. The teams were evenly matched, though they played with contrasting styles—the Crimson continually cut and crisply moved the ball, while the Bearcats played an aggressive, athletic defensive style.
However, it was some defense of its own—what Harvard coach Tommy Amaker referred to all season as the team’s “calling card”—that ultimately allowed the Crimson to advance.
Cincinnati star guard Sean Kilpatrick led all scorers with 18 points but managed only four shot attempts in the second half. Kilpatrick was hounded throughout the final 20 minutes by junior wing Wesley Saunders and a helping defense that was determined to take away his offense.
Likewise, junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi repeatedly blocked the way of high school teammate Justin Jackson, Cincinnati’s second-leading scorer, allowing him to convert on only five of his 15 attempts, nearly all of which came deep in the paint.
For much of the game, Harvard looked composed against favorite Cincinnati and its swarming, gambling defense. The Crimson absorbed the Bearcats’ pressure and led the whole way after trailing, 6-5, with 17:09 to play in the first half.
But with just over three minutes to play in the contest, that composure threatened to crumble. Two Troy Caupain free throws cut the Harvard lead to one, and on the ensuing possession, Moundou-Missi, bothered by the Cincinnati press, threw the ball away in the backcourt. The Bearcats had a chance to finally grab back the lead.
“I thought we were in business,” Bearcats coach Mick Cronin said.
But, once again, Jackson failed to convert on an attempt at the rim. The Bearcats grabbed another offensive board, but Kevin Johnson came up short on a three-point attempt. On the other end, with the shot clock winding down, Chambers sized up a pull-up jumper at the elbow.
As was the case last year against New Mexico, Chambers had not seen the ball go through the hoop much all afternoon—to that point, he was 1-of-9 from the field. But just like in last season’s upset, Chambers delivered another late dagger of a midrange jumper to give his team some much-needed breathing room.
“Going to the middle, Coach says that’s my shot at the free throw line…. Coach says if you get there, and it’s open, go ahead and take it,” Chambers said.
From there, the remaining breaks seemed to go Harvard’s way. Casey drew a charge on Kilpatrick, a layup attempt by Titus Rubles spun off the rim, and Kilpatrick lost control of the ball on a drive. In the last 30 seconds, the Crimson shrugged off its free throw woes—the team had gone 13-of-24 from the line up to that point—and sunk all four of its attempts to clinch the victory.
Early on, Harvard was carried by its three-point shooting; co-captain Laurent Rivard, who made five threes in the Crimson’s upset of New Mexico last season, hit all three of his attempts from beyond the arc in the first half, and fellow co-captain Brandyn Curry added two more to give Harvard a seven-point lead heading into the break.
Cincinnati looked as if it might physically dominate the Crimson over stretches, crashing the offensive boards and getting numerous second-chance opportunities.
But the Crimson defended well, forcing the Bearcats into long two-point attempts and contested shots at the rim. Cincinnati failed to knock down the open looks it got, shooting 36.8 percent overall.
Though the Harvard bench could not totally contain its excitement as the final buzzer sounded, the celebration on the court was not the flurry of bodies that it was last year against the Lobos. Saunders, who scored eight of his team-high 12 points in the second half after playing just ten minutes in the first frame due to foul trouble, reflected that the win was not unexpected for his team, given the quality of play that the squad has exhibited all season.
“Leading up to this game, Coach emphasized and we all talked about just living up to our values and our standards, and doing the things that have gotten us to this point,” Saunders said. “And so we felt as though, if we were able to do that, we would have a great chance of coming out with a victory.”
This time, postgame discussion of what the victory “meant” to Harvard sounded stale—that ground had been sufficiently covered a season ago. This one was just about basketball, a hotly contested game between evenly matched teams, one of which is quickly making a name for itself as a mid-major power.
“In my opinion, they’re one of the best teams we played all year,” Cronin said. “We knew that all week. They did not catch us by surprise by any stretch of the imagination.”
A highlight-reel slam by Casey, a stylish up-and-under lay-in from Saunders, the composed performance down the stretch—these were not plays made by Cinderella. These were plays made by a team that belonged playing in March.
“I think that we have become a program that’s become relevant in the world of college basketball with what we have been able to accomplish,” Amaker said. “Not just this season—I think you’ve seen what we have been trying to put together for a while.”

Plagued by a scoreless third quarter, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team suffered a 13-10 loss to No. 6/7 North Carolina at Navy Field in Chapel Hill, N.C. on Tuesday night.
After a tight first half that ended with the Crimson trailing, 6-5, the Tar Heels scored four goals in the opening six minutes of the second stanza to extend their lead to 10-5. Two of the North Carolina goals came on the extra-man, as the Harvard defense committed a pair of costly one-minute penalties early in the period.
Three of the Tar Heels’ four goals in the quarter came during a 38-second span that saw Walker Chafee rifle back-to-back shots past Harvard junior goalie Jake Gambitsky. Chad Tutton followed those efforts up eight seconds later with a goal of his own.
“Carolina outplayed us in a key stretch, and that wound up being the difference in the game,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik said. “It was really a back-and-forth game throughout, other than [that] key stretch early in the third quarter that ultimately cost us the game.”
Harvard grabbed the lead early on, recording the first two goals of the contest as North Carolina struggled to find its game offensively. Captain Peter Schwartz and fellow senior Carl Zimmerman both capitalized on feeds from sophomore Devin Dwyer to put the Crimson ahead.
But the Tar Heels soon established a rhythm and closed the frame with three straight goals. Despite allowing the Crimson to tie the game at three on a strike from sophomore Sean Mahon, North Carolina regained the lead less than a minute later and held it for the rest of the game.
“It’s disappointing, but I thought our effort was great,” Wojcik said. “We played hard. They’re very good all over the field.”
The Tar Heels came into the matchup ranked sixth nationally in the latest media poll, so Harvard understood the challenge it faced going on the road against one of the most talented and athletic squads in the country.
“Coach Wojcik said this in the beginning of the season, [and] he’s always told us you’ve got to schedule the hardest opponents week in and week out,” captain Joe Petrucci said. “Playing a team with as much skill and athleticism as UNC will definitely pay dividends down the road with our Ivy League schedule.”
Indeed, the Ancient Eight promises to be especially competitive this season, as four of the seven Ivy League teams are currently ranked among the top 20 teams in the nation.
Despite struggling in face-offs throughout the first half, securing just five of thirteen draws, the Crimson rebounded late in the game, going 9-of-14 in the second stanza. Six of Harvard’s wins came on violations by the Tar Heels, who were also called twice for 30-second penalties as a result.
“We were really confident in our whole face-off unit,” Wojcik said. “In particular, [freshman] Austin Williams played a really good game…. He was able to figure out their guy, and he really did a great job helping us get possession from face-offs.”
Williams helped spark Harvard’s three-goal run to begin the fourth quarter that cut the deficit to two. The two teams proceeded to trade goals before North Carolina sealed the victory with an empty net strike from Ryan Creighton.
Dwyer led the Crimson offense with four assists, as he consistently set up his teammates with accurate feeds.
“[Dwyer has] been playing great,” Petrucci said. “I think the best thing about Devin is he makes everybody around him better. He’s an extremely good feeder, he has excellent vision, [and] he’s always distributing the ball.”
Despite missing the first four games of the year due to injury, Dwyer leads the Crimson in assists with 11 so far this season.
Harvard employed a balanced attack against North Carolina, as seven different players tallied scores in the contest. Mahon, Zimmerman, and senior Daniel Eipp all netted two goals for the Crimson.
“Obviously, we’re upset with the result,” Petrucci said. “We lost the game and at the end of the day that’s what’s most important. I think it was clear from the beginning that we wanted the game more. Obviously, they’re a top five team and hanging with them is nice. But we want to win those games.”

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight.
 Now that we’re halfway through the semester, it’s time to catch up on all the gossip surrounding our fellow Ivy League brothers and sisters.
 Not that this is any new gossip, but another fraternity at Cornell was suspended last week for hazing—can’t help but feel that something like this happens every semester at Cornell.  Just last spring, two fraternities were closed, and another four were sanctioned after allegations of hazing. Chi Psi, which was put on probation last May, has now been placed on “interim suspension status as a result of credible allegations of serious hazing” according to the Cornell Chronicle. We can’t imagine that Chi Psi will be coming to Cambridge any time soon.
 Paying credit where credit is due, Columbia University has decided to stop offering academic credit for unpaid internships; but maybe this is more of a taking away credit where credit is due situation. The idea behind this move is that for-profit companies should be paying their interns, which is fair, but the only significance this has for Harvard students is that we’ll probably be seeing a lot more Columbia students at interviews for finance internships.
At Princeton, a new secret society has been uncovered. It’s not exactly an eating club, it’s more like a drinking club. The “21 Club” is populated by 21 juniors and 21 seniors. Its members, who are also usually members of the other eating clubs on campus, are tapped for the society based on very frequent drinking and partying on weekdays. The club gathers together annually for a timed drinking contest that typically ends with profuse vomiting. This seems like good old-fashioned fun.
 
In other news, Brown celebrated its 250th anniversary with some fireworks and managed to spell out “250” in the sky—although most of the people in attendance weren’t even Brown students. The celebrations will continue internationally until the commencement of the class of 2015.
 There have been mixed reactions to the announcement that Bloomberg is speaking at this year’s commencement. Over at the University of Pennsylvania, John Legend will be the commencement speaker, so is Penn’s commencement actually just a concert? Here’s a deal: let’s trade Bloomberg for Legend and turn commencement into Yardfest. That too complicated? It’s okay, Janelle Monáe is also pretty fly and will rock the Yard.
