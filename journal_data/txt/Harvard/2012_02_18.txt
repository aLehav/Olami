After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s office has made headway on the development of a new online registration portal that will enable students to submit study cards online.
Since FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke proposed the new system last year, a steering committee of administrators from across the University has convened to begin planning for the fully online portal, called the Student Information System.
Burke said that the new course registration tool will be designed to create “a seamless enrollment experience for faculty and students.”
He added that paperwork will be submitted online through SIS course registration. Currently, students select courses and print out a study card using an online portal introduced in fall 2005. Students then must obtain signatures from advisors and resident deans or faculty members in special cases.
SIS will also simplify cross-registration for both students and professors as well as create a database to make information more readily available for University administrators to conduct planning and analysis.
“There’s nothing really tying us all together right now, which makes teaching across boundaries and taking classes across boundaries fairly difficult, and that’s one of the things that we’re trying to solve,” Burke said.
Although the new tool will not be operational for several years, Burke said, the steering committee could have recommendations ready for University administrators as early as next fall.
At the committee’s first meeting, top University administrators, including Provost Alan M. Garber '76, voiced their support for the project, according to Nicholas L. Connors, a spokesperson for the Harvard University Information Technology department.
The committee, which is chaired by Burke and University Chief Information Officer Anne H. Margulies, will meet once a month for the next year and a half.
The committee also plans to host focus groups for students and faculty in order to solicit feedback as they develop the tool, Burke said.
The online submission of study cards has been a perennial Undergraduate Council campaign promise. UC President Danny P. Bicknell '13 said that the development of a wholly online portal is “definitely been overdue.”
UC Education Committee Chair Samuel F. Himel '12 said he will work to ensure that administrators consider student feedback when designing the new online system.
“I think the lesson of things like [Pre-Term Planning] and the Plan of Study Tool is that the value added...by a new system really depends on how user friendly the system is,” Himel said. “If you’re going to substitute a really clunky system for the paper system, it’s not going to be a step forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off its first Ivy League loss of the season, the Harvard men’s basketball team needed exactly this type of performance.
One week after falling at Princeton, the Crimson came out firing on all cylinders on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, dominating Brown, 69-42.
Defense was once again the key, as Harvard (22-3, 8-1 Ivy) held the Bears (7-19, 1-8) to its lowest offensive output of the season on 32.7-percent shooting. Brown’s Sean McGonagill, who entered the game sixth in the conference in scoring, averaging 14 points per game, was held to 11 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Matt Sullivan (11 points) was the only other Bear to finish in double figures.
Harvard received scoring from nine different players, as the Crimson shot 53.2 percent from the field, marking the first time this season Harvard shot over 50 percent in conference play.
“We talk a lot about regrouping and responding—I thought we did that incredibly well tonight,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad maintained its one-game lead in the Ancient Eight standings with the win.
“I thought we bounced back pretty well from last Saturday,” echoed co-captain Keith Wright, who recorded his fifth double-double in the first half and finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds. “We made an effort to come out and prove a point, and I think we did that.”
The Crimson had its way in the paint all evening, as forwards Wright, Kyle Casey, and Steve Moundou-Missi combined for 32 points and 21 rebounds. Harvard recorded 10 blocks on the night, matching a season high, and outrebounded the Bears, playing without starting forward Andrew McCarthy, by a 40-23 margin.
Moundou-Missi notched the third double-digit scoring performance of his career, posting a game-high 14 points on four-of-five shooting in 18 minutes off the bench. The rookie added six rebounds and four blocks—a career high.
“I thought his minutes were outstanding,” Amaker said of the forward. “He was active.”
Moundou-Missi’s classmates, point guard Corbin Miller and swingman Wes Saunders, also played crucial minutes off the bench, scoring nine points apiece.
While the rest of the Crimson shot two of 12 from beyond the arc, Miller connected on three of four three-point attempts, raising his season average to 49 percent.
Harvard’s bench, which outscored Brown’s, 42-9, also got five points apiece from junior Christian Webster and freshman Jonah Travis.
“We’ve gone 9, 10 guys deep,” explained Amaker, who played 10 players for at least 14 minutes on Friday. “Sometimes our bodies can wear down our opponents. That’s what we’re hoping to have happen in our league.”
Brown kept pace for the first six minutes of play, taking a 12-11 lead with 13:57 to play off a Matt Sullivan layup.
But it was all Harvard from there, as the Crimson responded with a 24-2 run over the next 12:16 to play, holding the Bears to 1-of-13 shooting from the field over the stretch.
“I thought we had a great attention to detail,” Amaker said. “I thought we limited their three-point opportunities, which was key for us. I thought we chased them off the three if we could.”
Eight different Crimson players found the bottom of the net during the run with Casey and Moundou-Missi leading the way, posting five apiece.
Moundou-Missi sparked the run, hitting a free throw, and then finding Miller for an open three to put the Crimson up, 15-12. Webster continued the run, driving to the hoop before flipping a pass to Travis under the basket for an open dunk.
Back-to-back and-one layups from Casey and Saunders gave the Crimson its first double-digit lead of the game, 25-14, with 9:06 to play.
Harvard continued to pour it on, as Wright finished a layup off an entry pass from junior point guard Brandyn Curry (nine assists), and Webster collected a Moundou-Missi block near midcourt and took it the length of the court for an easy score.
Moundou-Missi put the Crimson up by 21, sticking a short jumper and a pair of free throws to give Harvard the 35-14 edge.
Brown’s Jean Harris stopped the bleeding by sticking a mid-range jumper, but Harvard went into the break leading by 21, 37-16, and its lead never dipped below 16 the rest of the way.
“It was a nice performance by our ball club,” said Amaker, whose squad won its 26th straight game at Lavietes Pavilion, good for the second longest current home winning streak in the nation. “We came ready to play.”

PROVIDENCE—The Harvard men’s hockey team broke an NCAA record on Friday night against Brown.
Not for wins, or for losses, or for most goals scored. No, the Crimson now has reserved its spot in the record books for the most neutral record of them all: most ties in a single season.
Harvard became the first team in NCAA history to record 11 ties in one campaign, knotting the Bears, 3-3, at Meehan Auditorium.
After initially opening up a 2-0 lead, the Crimson (8-7-11, 6-4-9 ECAC) held a 3-2 advantage for much of the third period. But a Brown (8-14-4, 5-12-3 ECAC) score with just 1:46 left on the clock forced the game into overtime, where neither team could break the deadlock.
“There are good ties and bad ties. This one…we certainly don’t have a good taste in our mouths,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It’s a point on the road. It beats losing, but that’s about the only positive that I feel right now.”
The tie extends Harvard’s unbeaten streak in league play to eight games.
After failing to score in the first frame, Brown scored three times in the final 40 minutes, thanks to six Crimson penalties in that span.
“[The] power plays really put them back in the game [and] changed momentum of the game,” Donato said. “It hurts our ability to get more guys on the ice…and therefore hurt our ability to be more dangerous in the third period.”
On the Crimson attack, senior forward Alex Killorn led the way, tallying a team-high three points, including his 19th and 20th goals of the season.
“He was unbelievable,” sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard said. “He’s got a great shot, [and] he used it tonight. He’s a guy that can definitely change momentum in a game.”
Killorn’s first score was also his ninth power-play goal of the year. It snapped the Crimson’s two-game streak without a goal on the man advantage, Harvard’s longest drought of the season.
Junior forward Alex Fallstrom also tallied a goal and an assist in the draw.
The matchup against the Bears also marked the third straight contest in which the Crimson had a different starting goaltender than in the previous contest.
After rookie netminder Steve Michalek played against Northeastern on Monday night, Girard took over on Friday. Girard saved 32 of the 35 shots on the night.
Following a fast-paced opening to the first period, Brown senior Jarred Smith was whistled for a hooking call. And it didn’t take long for the Crimson, owner of the nation’s top power play, to take advantage.
A little under nine minutes in, junior defenseman Danny Biega took a shot from the right point which Bears goaltender Michael Clemente deflected right to Killorn in the slot. The senior pumped it past the Bears netminder just eight seconds after the start of the power play, giving the visitors the 1-0 lead.
But Killorn’s first-period scoring wasn’t finished just yet.
Exactly eight minutes later, with 3:14 remaining in the period, the senior struck again, scoring from the point for his 20th goal of the season.
Though Harvard held the two-goal advantage at the end of the first 20 minutes, the Bears had plenty of chances to score, including a three-on-two fastbreak midway through the period that nearly tied the game at one apiece. But Brown, which notched 12 shots to Harvard’s six, couldn’t get on the board in the first frame.
That quickly changed in the second, as Brown halved the deficit under two minutes in.  Standing in the slot, Crimson defenseman Danny Fick couldn’t clear the puck, and Smith made the sophomore pay, beating Girard to make it a one-goal game.
The Crimson struck next 11 minutes later. After taking the puck from Biega, Killorn skated around and lost the puck. But Fallstrom found it in the slot, and while falling, lofted it over the left shoulder of Clemente to help Harvard recapture the two-goal lead.
“It was obviously a big goal. We thought it was going to be the difference maker in the game,” Killorn said.
The Bears managed one more in the second period, but the Crimson held the tenuous 3-2 lead through the end of the second period and for most of the third.
But with just 1:46 left on the clock, Brown tied it up. With a scrum in front of the net, the puck squirted past Girard, forcing the game into a five-minute overtime period. Bears freshman forward Massimo Lamacchia was credited with the score.
“I played it badly, and I think I lost track of it,” Girard said. “I don’t even know how it went in.”
Harvard outshot Brown, 4-1, in the overtime period, but the opportunities proved fruitless as the Crimson failed to find the back of the net.
The scoreless extra time gave the Crimson its NCAA-record 11th tie, a feat which elicited mixed reactions from the team.
“I think you could look at it two ways,” Killorn said. “A lot of those games we came back, and we showed a lot of resiliency, but...a few of these games we’ve just given away. You don’t know how to feel about it. It’s a record.... But it’s a double-edged sword.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its toughest test of the season, the Harvard men’s volleyball team fell to No. 5 Penn State, 3-0, Friday night, in a game that served as a barometer for the Crimson’s national standing.
Despite a packed crowd at the Malkin Athletic Center, Harvard (6-2, 1-2 EIVA) was unable to sustain any meaningful pressure on the powerful Nittany Lions (9-1, 3-0), who controlled the match with a dominant service game. After a hot start that included a five-match winning streak to open the year, the Crimson’s loss to Penn State marked its second defeat in three contests.
“We love to have Harvard students and fans come out like that. It means a lot to our guys,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “I wish we could have given them a little bit more to cheer about.”
The first set was largely tight throughout, with six ties and four lead changes. Both teams struggled to get in a rhythm, each committing four service errors in the early action. But a few untimely Harvard miscues allowed Penn State to pull away near the end, securing the set, 25-20.
“We had some communication breakdowns,” said co-captain and outside hitter Matt Jones. “We had some balls hit the floor that we shouldn’t have [allowed].”
Harvard was again within striking distance in the middle of the second set, trailing Penn State, 10-7, but the Nittany Lions embarked on a 10-3 run to take control, eventually cruising to a 25-13 win.
“[Penn State outside hitter Peter Russell] went on a service run” Jones said. “Whenever it was close, their serving kind of took over. We didn’t serve back at them as well.”
Early in the third set, the Crimson built some momentum with kills from Jones and sophomore opposite hitter Nick Madden, taking the lead from Penn State, 8-6. But the Nittany Lions regained the lead, 9-8, with two service aces by junior Nick Turko and never looked back. After a quick 5-0 stretch later in the set that included one powerful kill that struck Jones in the face, Penn State again quieted the Harvard faithful, finishing off the Crimson, 25-17.
“[Penn State] didn’t give us a lot to work with,” Baise said. “I was hoping they would slow up a little bit and give our offense a chance to get going. But from the first point to the last, they were pretty sharp.”
Jones, Madden, and freshman outside hitter D.J. White led Harvard with seven kills each. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Nick Goodell, who did not commit an error in attack, keyed Penn State with 15 kills. The Crimson could not match the Nittany Lions’ ability to extend points, recording 13 digs to Penn State’s 26.
“When we’re not slowing up their offense at all, it really makes for a tough night,” Baise said. “We worked on defense all week, and we couldn’t slow them down.”
For Harvard, the matchup was a measuring stick for its place in the national picture following a 5-0 start. Despite the disappointing result, Baise believed his team still has the potential to compete with the best in the country on any given night.
“We wanted to see where we fit in that scale,” Baise said. “We’ve got a lot of work left to do, but I think we can play with them.”
Following Friday’s loss to the Nittany Lions and Saturday’s win over St. Francis, Harvard sits at fourth place in the EIVA standings. The top four teams earn a spot in the conference playoffs.
“I think we’ve seen that we can be one of those [playoff] teams,” Jones said. “It’s going to be a dogfight for the two, three, and four spots. We have to see what we can do to pick up one of those spots.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the ECAC’s No. 2 seed on the line heading into the last weekend of the regular season, the Harvard women’s hockey team knew it had to best Brown on Friday night to edge Clarkson in the conference standings.
And thanks to strong performances on both sides of the puck, the Crimson did just that, taming Brown, 5-1, at Bright Hockey Center.
Cornell later topped the Golden Knights, 2-1, in overtime, assuring Harvard sole possession of the second seed and home-ice advantage through the semifinals.
The Crimson came out of the gates quickly and never let up, though an impressive performance from Bears goalkeeper Katie Jamieson kept the score closer than the game would indicate.
“We came out firing,” junior forward Jillian Dempsey. “We got better with each period. Ultimately, it is about what we do and not the other team, so we just wanted to play our best and improve because the playoffs are coming up.”
Harvard (19-8-1, 16-4-1 ECAC) almost found itself ahead within the opening 20 seconds of the game, as a defensive mistake from Brown’s (8-13-7, 5-12-4) back line gifted the puck to Dempsey in front of goal. The junior launched a shot straight into Jamieson, and then found the five-hole on the rebound only for the Bears to clear the puck off the goal line.
And despite going down a player a minute later, the Crimson continued to pressure Jamieson and her defense with strong puck movement and quality looks at goal. But Brown withstood the pressure down low, with Jamieson shutting down a number  of Harvard scoring attempts.
But the Crimson broke through just under 13 minutes into the frame, as the puck found its way to freshman defender Sarah Edney at the top of the slot, who fired a backhand off Jamieson’s glove and into the back of the net.
But the one goal was all the Crimson would find in the first period, despite its numerous opportunities, as the Bears defense held its own.
To give the Brown defense new looks, Harvard coach Katey Stone wanted to change the offensive pattern of her team’s attack.
“They packed it in pretty good,” Stone said.  “They were good defensively down low, and so we wanted to swing the puck up high and generate most of our offense from our defense. And once we started to get those pucks through, good things happened.”
Harvard’s passing around the blue line opened up a lot of open shots from a distance for the first half of the second frame, but it was a breakaway from Dempsey off a steal and pass from freshman Samantha Reber that gave the Crimson a two-goal cushion.
Dempsey deked left and drew Jamieson out of her goal before drilling the puck behind the netminder for Harvard’s second score of the night.
Less than three minutes later, Edney doubled her tally on the day, firing a shot from the blue line off a pass from sophomore Kalley Armstrong that flew through Jamieson’s five hole.
With the puck movement along the blue line providing goals, the Bears were forced to cover out wide and unpack down low, which opened up holes in front of the goal for Harvard. This change allowed the Crimson more opportunities on passes and rebounds near the goal, and Harvard soon took advantage.
With Harvard on the power play, junior Kelsey Romatoski fired a shot from the blue line that hit Jamieson and fell to her right, where junior forward Kaitlin Spurling was able to pick up the puck and shoot it past Jamieson, giving the Crimson a four-goal advantage heading into the locker room for the third period.
“Especially from a defensive standpoint, this week in practice we worked on getting a lot of shots through [on goal], and that was one of our goals [tonight],” Edney said. “I think we accomplished that.”
A power play goal from junior forward and Czech national team captain Alena Polenska ended hopes of a Harvard shutout early in the final frame, but sophomore Lyndsey Fry added her 15th goal of the season with under four minutes to play to reclaim the four-goal edge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 11 seconds left in the game and Harvard women’s basketball down three points, junior Emma Golen grabbed the rebound and quickly pushed the ball up-court. After scanning the open floor she pulled up behind the three-point line and let the shot fly.
But, the shot, like many others for the Crimson on Friday night, did not fall and Golen’s team lost to Brown, 58-55, at Pizzitola Memorial Sports Center.
It was not all bad for Harvard (12-10, 5-3 Ivy), though, as it fought back late to erase a 14 point second-half deficit. The comeback began at the 13:49 mark with junior Victoria Lippert’s made three-pointer and lasted until there were 45 seconds left in the game, at which point the Bears (15-8, 6-3) finally managed to capitalize on a Crimson turnover and did not let up the rest of the way.
As was true in the last minute, turnovers proved to be detrimental for Harvard throughout the game. It tallied 20 on the night, the most it has suffered against any Ivy team all year and more than three over its season-average. Brown did its most to capitalize off of the giveaways, running the ball and scoring 19 points off of these Crimson mistakes.
The first half was a game of runs between the two teams, but those of the Bears were more numerous and more lengthy than those of Harvard. A little less than half way into the first period, the Crimson took what would be its biggest lead of the game when an 8-0 run gave it a 17-11 lead. The remaining 10 minutes of the half were all Brown though, with the result that by halftime the scoreboard had been flipped and the visitors now trailed, 31-25.
The second period started off as more of the same and the lead was extended to a game-high of 14. At that point, though, the ball was given to Lippert to do what she does best—hit threes. She did just that, hitting her 44th three-point shot of the season, good for third best in the Ivy League. With that made basket momentum swapped sides and it was now the Crimson who controlled the game.
After a quick Bears layup, sophomore Christine Clark was sent to the line and sank two free throws. The next couple of minutes entailed each side swapping baskets until freshman Erin McDonnell sunk her second three-pointer of Ivy play with just under five minutes remaining in the game.
At 1:50, the lead was cut to five when Golen hit yet another shot from deep for her team. This was followed by a layup from Clark and a free throw by Lippert. But that was as close as the Harvard would get as a missed free throw and a turnover put the ball back in the hands of Brown with 12 seconds left to play. The only thing left for Harvard to do was foul, and it did just that. The Bears made one of two free throws, extending the lead to three, but missed jumpers by Lippert as well as co-captain Brogan Berry as time expired sealed the Brown victory.
Clark led all scorers with 20 points off of seven for 13 shooting, a definite upturn after going a combined seven for 26 in last weekend’s play. The opposite was true for Berry as she went two for 16 on Friday night after shooting 16 for 28 in her previous two games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard and Yale men’s basketball teams met, the Crimson was dominant en route to a 65-35 thrashing of the Bulldogs in New   Haven.
Early on in the teams’ rematch Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard looked poised for another blowout, especially after a floater by junior point guard Brandyn Curry capped a 23-4 Harvard run and put the Crimson up, 35-15, with 4:06 to go in the first half.
The Bulldogs clawed their way back with a 23-7 spurt of their own to cut the deficit to five. But at that point, the Crimson again turned to Curry, who executed a give-and-go off an inbounds with freshman Corbin Miller and hit a big three from the right corner to extend the Crimson lead to eight.
Harvard (23-3, 9-1 Ivy) never looked back from there, firmly establishing itself as the class of the Ancient Eight with its 66-51 victory over Yale (17-7, 7-3) and putting itself in position to clinch at least a share of the Ivy League title at home next weekend.
“There were a lot of factors that made this a big game,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was very, very proud of our kids for the effort they were able to bring.”
Curry’s long ball—which was followed by a Greg Mangano basket and a Miller three—was not even the zenith of Curry’s big night. On the next Crimson possession, the junior drove left baseline and threw down his first career dunk over the 6’10” Mangano as the crowd exploded with excitement and began chanting his name.
“I didn’t even know I dunked it, to be honest,” said a smiling Curry, who finished with a season-high 18 points. “I just went for it, and it happened.”
The slam gave the Crimson an 11-point lead, and Harvard stayed in control from there. Mangano hit a three with 5:03 to go to pull within eight, but Harvard responded with a 9-0 run that co-captain Keith Wright ended with a jam as the Crimson cruised to its second win of the season over its Ivy rivals.
“When we watch film and scouted [Yale], it’s kind of been the way they played a lot,” Amaker said. “They’ve been down and just kind of marched their way in and won games. That’s the mark of a good team, and a tough team, and certainly we had to play that way and more to beat that team tonight.”
Harvard dominated the first half until the final four minutes. Back-to-back threes by co-captain Oliver McNally pushed the Harvard lead to 15-9, and the Crimson scored eight more unanswered before Yale’s Michael Grace ended the scoring drought with a jumper.
From there, Harvard continued to pour it on with a 12-4 run during which five different players scored. Curry found Casey for a dunk with to put Harvard up, 33-15, and then the point guard split two defenders with a crossover and hit a baseline floater to cap the stretch and extend the Crimson lead to its largest point.
“I was just being aggressive,” Curry said. “Mangano’s a tough force down low, and they had a couple of guards who were hurt. So we just had to wear them down, and I was just attacking all night.”
Facing the possibility of another embarrassing blowout loss, Yale found its game as the half wound down. Jeremiah Kreisberg halted the Harvard run with a put-back layup, and nine more unanswered Bulldog points cut the Crimson advantage to 35-26 heading into the break.
Yale stayed hot early in the second, and a Kreisberg jumper over Casey cut the lead to 39-34. Curry responded with a jumper, but Mangano matched, and two free-throws by the Bulldog center brought the visitors within four moments later.
Amaker then called a timeout and orchestrated Miller’s give-and-go with Curry, who came in shooting just 24 percent from long range. But the junior nailed the three to give Harvard some much-needed breathing room.
“I told [Curry] this weekend, ‘You just have to be aggressive,’” Wright said. “Teams aren’t expecting him to drive the ball and have the scorer’s mentality that he had in that second half especially. He played tremendous. I’m proud of him.”
Wright finished with 10 points, eight rebounds, and one rejection, tying him with Brian Cusworth ’07 for the Crimson blocks record and helping Harvard outscore Yale, 20-2, in the paint in the first half.
Mangano, the Ivy League’s leading scorer coming in, led Yale with 22 and 11, but the Crimson held guard Austin Morgan—who averaged 19 points against Harvard last season—to just one made field goal for the second straight matchup against Harvard.
“We feel that when [Morgan] has a good night, they’re very successful as a team,” Curry said. “So our emphasis was really to limit his touches and make everything difficult for him.”
The victory tied last year’s squad for the program record in wins and put the Crimson in position to clinch at least a share of its second consecutive Ivy title if it can take care of business at home—where it has won 27 straight—next weekend.
“We’re just one step closer to our goal,” Wright said.

If you want to find Felipe Herrera, look for the man pressing tortillas behind the counter. Felipe fits right in with the hectic atmosphere of his tacqueria, where he works six days a week. "I am dedicated to keeping the cheapest prices in town with all the freshest ingredients," he says. "It's just incredible that I can do it in such a small kitchen!" All his ingredients come straight from the market, and he never uses cans.
Mr. Bartley's Burgers
Joe Bartley is a Harvard Square legend. His son Bill Bartley calls him "a crazy old guy" whose lively personality adds to the environment of his burger joint. Around the walls, you'll see pictures of Joe with friends, locals, and family. You can usually find the 82-year-old Bartley sitting in a chair outside his restaurant. Stop in and say hello, but be warned: you might walk out with a burger named after you.

"Everybody get up, it's time to slam now." There's a real jam going down right before tomorrow's Harvard-Yale basketball game: The UC's Social Programs Committee is hosting a tailgate in conjunction with the Harvard Athletics department.
Support the team as it hopes to repeat its victory against Yale from last month. The win will be particularly important to pad Harvard's lead in the Ivy League, as Yale (6-2) stays close at second place.
"We expect a good student turnout, especially since Harvard will obviously win the game!" said Spenser R. Goodman '14, chair of the Social Programs Committee.
There is incentive to attend, as well. One hundred Crimson t-shirts and pub food and drink tickets will be given away during the tailgate.
In light of the team's continued success this year, the Social Programs Committee is looking to begin a UC tradition of regularly hosting tailgates like these before basketball games.
Future UC events hosted by the Social Programs Committee will include a pool party, a dodgeball tournament, and even a themed student dance.

You know Harvard is getting desperate for some social media publicity when it publishes an album of ready-to-download 'Facebook Timeline Cover Photos' ranging from the Weld Boat House to Jeremy Lin in his Harvard uniform (do we finally have a mascot?!).
Though the website clearly states that the photos are not intended to be used or perceived as sponsorship of any kind, is it too much to ask if perhaps Harvard might investigate a promotional partnership with the Harvard Douchebag?
In spite of this shamelessly forget-me-not move from his alma mater, Mark Zuckerberg has yet to take notice. As his recent cover photos show, he'd rather be a Harvard Good Guy.
