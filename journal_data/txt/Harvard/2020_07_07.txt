After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students attending colleges and universities operating entirely online will not be allowed to remain in residence in the United States, according to guidelines released Monday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The State Department will not issue visas to students who are taking all of their courses online for the fall semester and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will not allow these students to enter the United States.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said he condemns the guidelines in a statement on Monday.
“We are deeply concerned that the guidance issued today by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement imposes a blunt, one-size-fits-all approach to a complex problem, giving international students, particularly those in online programs, few options beyond leaving the country or transferring schools,” Bacow wrote.
Earlier the same day, Harvard announced that it will hold all courses online and allow just 40 percent of students — including all freshmen and approved sophomores, juniors and seniors — to live on campus in the fall semester.
The Harvard International Office and spokespeople for the University did not respond to questions about whether the current reopening plan will place international students in the category of students who will not be allowed to remain in the United States.
However, Bacow wrote that the guidance “undermines” the planning the University laid out for the fall.
“This guidance undermines the thoughtful approach taken on behalf of students by so many institutions, including Harvard, to plan for continuing academic programs while balancing the health and safety challenges of the global pandemic,” he wrote.
International students who are currently in the United States must depart the country or transfer to a college or university with in-person instruction, or risk facing “immigration consequences including, but not limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings,” per the new guidelines.
Students attending colleges and universities that adopt a hybrid model, meanwhile, will be allowed to remain in residence and receive visas if they are taking at least some of their coursework in person rather than online.
Bacow wrote that Harvard will “work closely” with other colleges and universities nationwide to “chart a path forward.”
“We must do all that we can to ensure that our students can continue their studies without fear of being forced to leave the country mid-way through the year, disrupting their academic progress and undermining the commitments—and sacrifices—that many of them have made to advance their education,” he wrote.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said that Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliot is reaching out to ambassadors on behalf of international students at a virtual panel discussion on Monday.
“He is personally reaching out to the ambassadors — the U.S. ambassadors — in all countries that our international students are coming from and figuring out what we can do to expedite visa processes,” Claybaugh said.
Ege Yumusak ’16 — a Ph.D. student and member of the bargaining committee for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers — said the issue is “incredibly important” to the union, and that she is looking forward to working with the University to fight the guidelines and potential deportations.
“Whether it is engaging in political action such as suing the Trump administration, or working together with our political allies to make sure that this notice doesn't become law, we'll be organizing on this issue to represent student workers,” Yumusak said.
Yumusak added that HGSU-UAW expects Harvard to show their policies “put people first” and protect students from deportation and COVID-19.
“We think that this is a hard challenge that they are facing and we're open to collaborating with them,” Yumusak said. “As organizers in the community, we should be aligned on this issue and we hope to work together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 7, 2020 at 12:11 p.m.
Compared with its peers in the Ivy League, Harvard has offered a stringent plan for the fall semester — allowing no more than 40 percent of undergraduates to return to campus at once and keeping all course instruction online.
Harvard College announced Monday that all freshmen and a portion of upperclassmen who receive approval will be allowed to live on campus in the fall semester. Though administrators wrote that plans for the spring semester will not be announced until December, they wrote that allowing the senior class to return to campus will be the priority.
Yale University announced July 1 it will allow freshmen, juniors, and seniors to live on campus in the fall semester, and sophomores, juniors, and seniors to live on campus in the spring semester, in hopes of reducing density to “around 60 percent of normal.”
Like Harvard, Yale is not reducing its tuition, though it will also offer students who do not spend the full year on campus two tuition-free summer courses in 2021.
Princeton University announced July 6 it will allow freshmen and juniors to study on campus in the fall semester and sophomores and seniors to study on campus in the spring semester. All students will also receive a 10 percent tuition reduction for both semesters.
Roughly half of Dartmouth College students will reside on campus each quarter, giving priority to freshmen in the fall and spring terms, per a June 29 announcement. The school operates on a quarterly system with fall, winter, spring, and summer quarters.
Similarly, Stanford University announced on June 3 that though remote online instruction will remain the “default option,” it will offer housing to the equivalent of two classes per academic quarter with the expectation that two quarters will be completed on campus and at least one quarter will be completed online.
Some peer institutions, like Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania, announced in late June they will allow students from all classes to return to campus. Both will utilize a hybrid approach to instruction that combines online and in person classes.
Administrators at Cornell wrote that they are reopening its campus in rural Ithaca, N.Y., because they believe it will be a “better option for protecting the public health of our community than a purely online semester.”
Though the University of Pennsylvania will only guarantee housing for freshman and sophomores, it said it will lease off-campus space to accommodate housing for juniors and seniors.
Brown University has yet to announce whether students will return to campus in the fall, though it has set a decision deadline of July 15.
In their announcement, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana cited the school’s urban environment and proportion of students who live on campus as two factors that distinguish Harvard from its peers.
“Our bustling urban environment, the ease of grabbing the T into Boston, our intergenerational residential communities that house 98% of our undergraduates, our global research community of students, faculty, staff, postdocs and visitors from around the world – Harvard was built for connection, not isolation,” Bacow, Gay, and Khurana wrote.
On July 7, however, MIT invited only the senior class back to campus for the fall semester, according to The Tech. The school plans to open the campus to first-year students, sophomores, and juniors in the spring.
Other differences in return policies include shipping and storage.
Dartmouth has committed to shipping students who are not returning to campus their belongings. In mid-May, the college offered three options to all of its students: placing belongings in controlled storage, returning to campus for a “structured pickup” in July, or having the college pack and ship belongings, according to The Dartmouth. Both the storage option and the shipping option will be at Dartmouth’s expense.
Harvard told students they could continue to store their belongings with Olympia Storage or have them shipped to their place of residence at their own expense. The school offered a $175 storage stipend to students who are on financial aid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students voiced indignation, disappointment, and “heartbreak” after Harvard announced Monday morning that it would allow freshmen and very few upperclassmen to live on campus this fall.
In the hours following the decision, undergraduates took to a College-wide group chat, an Instagram livestream, and Facebook meme groups to commiserate and, occasionally, to find levity after months spent anticipating Harvard’s plans for the fall term.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email Monday morning that Harvard would house only the Class of 2024 and as many students who “must be on campus to progress academically” this fall as it can without exceeding 40 percent of undergraduates. All courses will be taught virtually for students both on and off campus, and all will return to normal letter grading after Harvard adopted an emergency satisfactory-unsatisfactory grading system in the spring.
Though students took to unofficial channels to react, the College also held a formal meeting to walk undergraduates and parents through their decision-making process Monday afternoon. They mostly reiterated several key aspects of the Monday email and accompanying list of Frequently Asked Questions: the criteria for for upperclassmen to petition to live on campus in the fall, the shape of a planned online shopping period, and the details of a compressed academic calendar.
As notable as the matters administrators mentioned, however, were the issues they left out.
Khurana, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair did not mention the College’s decision not to change its tuition fees — which climbed slightly from the 2019-2020 rate — during the panel.
The earlier email announcement noted that enrolled students living off-campus will not pay for room and board. The College will also grant students on financial aid an allowance of $5,000 per semester and relieve them of their term-time work expectation this fall.
During the panel, Khurana listed several of Harvard’s attributes that he said posed unique challenges as administrators considered how to safely return students to campus. He cited Harvard’s urban and “porous” campus — one that is frequented by visitors from around the world — and its residential system, where 98 percent of undergraduates live in University dorms.
“The intergenerational community we live in relies a lot on a lot of folks from different backgrounds and experiences all interacting together in our community,” Khurana said. “How you adapt that for COVID is anything but obvious.”
Samyra C. Miller ’21 said the panel discussion frustrated her because its format — which she described as a “rehearsed Boadway script” — failed to leave space for students to pose further questions.
Miller ultimately organized her own livestreamed discussion on her Instagram account, where more than 600 viewers tuned in to process the decision. She said the announcement left her emotional.
“It is just heartbreaking. If somebody would have said this was how my college experience was gonna go, I would have said, ‘Stop lying.’ I would have bet against it,” she said.
“We saw what happened to seniors this past spring. And we felt for them, that was awful,” she added. “I never thought that it would be my class. And I think that was the biggest reality check.”
While many students said they expected Harvard would only welcome one cohort back to campus in the fall, they debated whether it would be the freshmen or the senior class. To the many seniors’ dismay, Harvard administrators ultimately chose to invite the Class of 2024 in a bid to smoothly transition them to undergraduate life.
Menatallah N. Bahnasy ’22 said she supported the College’s decision to house the freshman class on campus in the fall.
“I always was a big proponent of at least having first year's get the fall since I think it's really crucial for them to just get a footing on campus,” she said. “I think it's really important for the start of a new journey and chapter to be able to be on campus.”
Prashanth Kumar ’21, however, said while he understood the reasoning behind the decision, he questioned whether freshmen would be able fully experience campus life given social distancing guidelines, as well as the absence of upperclassmen mentors and College events.
“What are the freshmen gaining specifically if they're all going to be isolated in their rooms?” Kumar asked.
Sophomores and juniors, for their part, learned Monday that they could spend a full year of their undergraduate education away from campus. Bacow, Gay, and Khurana wrote in their email Monday that the College is considering three options for the spring semester. The first model, which assumes worsened conditions, would send freshmen home and keep only students who must learn from campus. The second model would swap freshmen out for seniors. Only the third would welcome back multiple class cohorts. The College anticipates selecting one of the paths in early December.
Citing the fact that seniors will be prioritized in the spring semester, Jaron M. Zhou ’22 said he had to reconcile himself to the fact that — as a rising junior — he might lose a full quarter of his College experience.
He said the moments after the decision dropped were marked by a frenzy of communication on various social channels as friends shared immediate reactions.
“I was kind of juggling between Twitter, between Snapchat, between the GroupMe,” he said.
The GroupMe to which Zhou referred is a lively College-wide chat, inaugurated a few days ago to facilitate mass discussion about the College’s impending decision. In the chat, more than 1,600 undergraduates shared speculations and despairing memes, as well as bingo boards designed to satirize common administrative placations.
“Judging from the reactions during and after the panel discussion I think a lot of people got bingos,” Zhou added.
Hordes of students joined the GroupMe following invitations from friends to exchange rumors about the College’s imminent announcement, which Khurana indicated would occur Monday in an email sent to students last week.
Luke D. M. Albert ’22 said that the administration’s approach to communication was “unproductive” in the days leading up to the decision.
“They announced that there was going to be an announcement so that they would have a special date in which they would make this decision,” he said. “I think that was a bad idea, because then that sort of allowed this big tension to build and people to get nervous over the week.”
Albert said he agreed with Harvard’s decision to bring only one cohort back to campus in the interest of public health, though he said he didn’t think Harvard committed to doing nearly enough to support students in the aftermath of the harrowing decision process.
“I don't think their priority has clearly been to maximize the wellbeing and educational environment of the students. I think it's to keep as much of the revenue flow as normal as possible — to keep as many people as enrolled as normal as possible – without making the sacrifices or hard commitments to support students,” Albert said.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on student criticisms.
Though Bahnasy said another semester of online classes was a “hard pill to swallow,” she said she is optimistic that administrators, faculty, and students will adapt to replicate the Harvard experience as closely as possible.
“I would love to be able to be back in the dining hall, hanging out with peers and friends, but I think it's just such an unprecedented time and it's tough to know how things will change,” she Bahnasy said. “Something might come up in the next few weeks. Maybe the virus takes a turn in a direction that none of us expected. Maybe it worsens really drastically, maybe it subsides.”
“It's sort of like a work in progress,” she said.
