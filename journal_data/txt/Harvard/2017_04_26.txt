After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear readers,
We are delighted to present The Crimson Arts Board’s spring special issue. In this, our second annual themed supplement, we focus on the intersections between art and politics. In the board’s discussions of possible topics for our extra pages this week, the frontier between the realm of art and culture and the world of politics emerged as a clear center of interest for our editors. We hoped to survey this contested and contentious landscape by talking to artists, critics, writers, politicians, and economists on campus and beyond.
We knew that we had to approach such a topic with sensitivity, nuance, and a knowledge of our limits. Ben Lerner writes in his 2011 novel “Leaving the Atocha Station,” “I tried hard to imagine my poems or any poems as machines that could make things happen, changing the government or the economy or even their language, the body or its sensorium, but I could not imagine this, could not even imagine imagining it.” Yet for many of us, understanding the connections between poems, governments, and economies has never felt more important, as we attempt to situate our own artistic or critical practices within a political climate that has changed radically in the past few months. Issues of identity, inclusion, cross-cultural exchange, intellectual and journalistic freedom, and social impact have come to the fore in both contemporary artistic work and today’s political debates. The media has assumed an unprecedented importance as a tool of both power and resistance, while theatricality and spectacle have become almost expected conditions of political life. Artists working in a variety of media have in turn fought spectacle with spectacle, images with images, words with words.
Knowing that any attempt to map these trends would be limited and partial, we focused our coverage on artistic and political intersections taking place at Harvard or around Boston. We talked to artists who exhibited politically minded works in this year’s Harvard Student Art Show, considered Elizabeth Warren as an author, and explored the implications of the possible defunding of the National Endowment for the Arts for local cultural organizations.
So, what do the arts have to offer us these days? Are the arts no more than a realm of escapist fantasy, or worse, of legitimation for existing structures of power and wealth? Or can the arts make space for the imagination of alternatives? Can works of art generate political possibilities? We leave it to you to decide.
We would like to thank all of the execs, writers, and compers without whom this issue, and indeed this entire semester of Arts production, would not have been possible. Your thoughtfulness and commitment have ensured the quality of our content, while your quirky humor, excellent music taste, and genuine kindness have sustained our community. Previous chairs Ha D.H. Le ’17 and Victoria Lin ’17, who dreamed up our first themed supplement last year, have been our role models in this project as in so many other things. We would also like to thank our design execs, Tiffany K. Lam ’18 and Vivian W. Wan ’18, for their beautiful work throughout the semester. Our special appreciation goes to illustration comper Julianna Kardish ’20 for this supplement’s fantastic cover image, to FM chair Laura E. Hatt ’18 for coming in to give us a life-saving CTP tutorial, and to design chairs Nathan A. Cummings ’18 and Brandon A. Wright ’18 for their incredible work on this project.  Finally, thank you to Andrew M. Duehren ’18, our Managing Editor, and Derek K. Choi ’18, our President, for their unfailing dedication and support this semester.
With our best wishes,
Elizabeth C. Keto ’18 and J. Thomas Westbrook ’18
Arts Chairs

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rebecca Sheehan, a visiting associate professor of Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard, spoke with the Harvard Crimson about how she sees politics and film interacting under the Trump administration. On leave as an associate professor of Cinema and Television Arts at California State University, Sheehan has also authored several works touching on the intersection of cinema with disciplines ranging from philosophy to sculpture.
The Harvard Crimson: You are currently creating a list of “100 Movies to Watch” during Trump’s presidency. Why do you feel like that’s an important list to make?
Rebecca Sheehan: I think many people who occupy all sorts of positions on the political spectrum are looking for answers and that film is one of those places that our culture goes to think about what it is to be American, what our society values, and why. So I think the sudden relevance of film classics—for example, “Citizen Kane”, apparently one of Trump’s favorite films, which is so fitting because he’s such a Citizen Kane character!—suddenly these films made 60 years ago have such resonance with topics that we’re seeing played out in our current political landscape, combined with the fact that we see history repeating itself in so many ways. People who are well-educated find frustration in that because they can see where things are going—or they think they can see where things are going—and they don’t know how to stop them.
The other aspect of this is that the media is playing such a tremendous role in the current political landscape, especially social media and television. We suddenly have a reality TV star in the White House who is running this administration and the politics coming out of this administration are very much like reality TV, and I think a lot of people don’t really understand how that media is functioning in relation to their political realities because it’s so new. So my friend and I thought that it would be fun to post on social media these films that people can watch to allow them to think critically about the present moment through films that talked about similar issues and circumstances in the past, if only to give people hope that there were moments of crisis in our democracy that occurred much earlier than now.
Some of the populist inclinations that are reflected in a film like “Citizen Kane,” we get a lot of the same frustrations that people are feeling now. It’s not like there’s anything new under the sun. The 30s and 40s were post-Depression films that were really speaking to Americans who were economically dispossessed... So I think the tendency of film to reflect social realities and political realities make it a good kind of medicine for people trying to find a place to critically reflect on their current moment while also perhaps escaping it for a bit. Because looking at a film from 60 years ago allows you to escape your present moment, but to also realize that this is not anything particularly new, that history repeats itself and recombines its repetitions.
THC: How did you go about choosing which films to go into that list? You mention older classics like “Citizen Kane.” Are there more modern, contemporary movies on that list?
RS: One film that I thought of for my VES70 class this semester is a Christopher Nolan film, “Inception.” But another one of his films, “The Dark Knight Rises,” was a film that a lot of people were talking about on social media after the inauguration because there were lines in Trump’s inauguration speech that were totally lifted from “The Dark Knight Rises,” and everyone’s going, “Did he plagiarize Bane in this?” It’s really interesting though because it’s not that he plagiarized Bane, it’s that no one had tapped into this dark populism that [Nolan] saw growing as a resentment to globalization, a resentment to the first black president... It has echoes for the reason that Nolan was really using this blockbuster action film, part of the Batman franchise, to critically reflect something that was happening in American culture, which is why I love Christopher Nolan.
We’re going to have to see how Hollywood responds to Trump. We’ve already seen a lot of it, but for the most part Hollywood is anti-Trump, so I think it’s going to be interesting to see what films come out of that. One film that I saw a trailer for recently called “Beatrice Goes to Dinner”: it stars Salma Hayek, who’s now in her 50s—how did that happen?—her and, I can’t remember who stars across from her, but she’s cast as this kind of New-Age-y masseuse hypnotherapist who is invited by one of her ritzy Beverly Hills clients to this dinner party and she kind of squares off with this really conservative white guy who, you know, is proud of going hunting in Africa and killing animals, you know, boasting about things like this, and at some point she says something like “When I came to this country…” and during the dinner he asks, “Did you come here illegally?” It’s a film, though, that seems to be coming out of the Trump era, and one of the taglines or one of the critics’ responses to it, I think from the New York Times, was “the first film of the Trump era,” which is really interesting because I think they’re right. Now we’re talking about these cultural differences, and we’re also now talking about racism and classism, and xenophobia, and all of these things that this terrible election have brought to the surface, that used to be repressed in polite company. What the films seems to be about is, you go to dinner and you don’t talk about these things, but the entire comedy of the films rests on the fact that they keep bubbling up nonetheless, which is kind of a metaphor for our entire last election. It’s like, no, no, no, these elements don’t exist, but yes they do, and they won, so now what do we do? So I think it will be interesting to see what Hollywood does.
I saw an interesting film recently called “Get Out,”—I love “Get Out”—but I think it is so interesting because I think it was made with the assumption that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election. So for that reason, it’s going to become such an interesting historical document, right, where it’s produced in this moment where there’s all this backlash and criticism against this hypocritical white liberalism, and then suddenly Trump wins, and the film is screened to audiences who are I don’t think are the intended audiences for this film to be screened to…. That’s another film I think you could call of this particular political moment because some of what it is criticizing is that which did not put Hillary Clinton in office, you know, because people were tired of this. We’re tired of this snotty, holier-than-thou liberalism and the entire point of that film is that her parents are so cool, they’re not racist, they’re liberal! And then it turns out that they have the darkest past ever.
THC: One common thread that I’ve noticed from those two films you mentioned are important non-white characters. How do you think that is going to play a role in coming films, after the “Oscars So White” criticisms and claims of whitewashing in Hollywood, and other similar controversies in the film industry?
RS: That landscape is changing rapidly, and it’s going to change even more rapidly now that Trump is in office, because Hollywood has set itself in opposition to Trump. that opposition will basically carry out to be more diversity in Hollywood. There’s already a huge impact on television. Look at Bill O’Reilly! I think a lot of the dismay over Bill O’Reilly’s behavior was a backlash against Trump being elected, even though he treated women the way he did, right?
Hollywood also has an economic motivation for becoming more diverse, which it just needs to realize. Hollywood has been stuck for a long time in not wanting to take a risk on veering away from the known audiences. In general, you see less diversity in terms of content being produced in Hollywood in that past five to ten years. You have way more sequels, franchises, big budget action movies, and it’s because those turn out a reliable audience, and they sell abroad. And a big action movie with not much plot, not much character development, is not alienating to non-English speaking audiences. So if the film is mostly visual, than it’s an interesting kind of return to the silent era of cinema, where film was totally international because there were no linguistic barriers. But the downside to that is that you don’t see as much space in Hollywood’s bandwidth for melodrama, or for films that have a lot of story and character and plot development. So for that economic reason, I think you’ve seen less diversity of content in Hollywood.
Now another reason you’ve seen less diversity overall—very few women, very few minority, non-white characters, producers, directors—a lot of that is also risk. Hollywood doesn’t want to take a risk on trying to appeal to a female audience. That’s a niche audience! And it’s like, yeah, but women are half of the country, you know? Once Hollywood ceases to see non-white audiences and non-male audiences as niche audiences, which they’re not, economically or just in term of demographics, they will diversify. And I think actually TV is forcing them to do that, because TV has moved into the markets that they’re not serving.
THC: Why do you think that is? What about TV has made that shift so prominent?
I think it’s simply that they can target-market better. They can reach the specific market that they want to reach, and the distribution costs are much less that way, they can cut costs elsewhere and not really waste marketing to people who are never going to watch a show like “Transparent,” “Master of None,” these shows that are really specifically targeted toward more diverse audiences, but also certain groups like millennials or groups that want to see trans actors on screen and are particularly intrigued by that story. You see more diverse content coming from these online platforms, and there’s an economic reason behind that, where they don’t have to take as much risk to produce that content, and to distribute it as a Hollywood studio would. But I think once the studios realize that there’s a market for this content that they’re missing, essentially, they’re going to move into that—hopefully, fingers crossed!
There are also ways in which, you know, I mean the ACLU is suing the Hollywood studios right now. They’re bringing a discrimination suit on behalf of female filmmakers. They have enough evidence of discrimination over the years to do that, which is really frustrating. Either market or the law will ultimately force the studios to become more diverse. You’re also seeing more consciousness about that. “Oscars So White” was the first big backlash against that, and that was last year? And the year before that was the terrible all-male year, where it was like “Birdman” versus “Boyhood”? And it’s like, all right, do we have any stories about women ever being told? There is more awareness of that in Hollywood, but it’s still a white man’s world. It’s hard to break out of that. But Trump’s election has raised awareness about the power of racism and misogyny in a way that has made people who think that these problems are solved, it’s convinced them that they’re not and that we still need to work really hard on them to make sure that we don’t slip backwards and that we in fact make more progress toward equality, because we have not achieved it. There are a lot of white liberal men in Hollywood who think, “Ah, my life is going fine.” They don’t realize the lack of equality because they don’t experience it firsthand, and I think it’s hard if you’re not in the body of the person experiencing it.
Unless you’re the one experiencing it, it’s very hard to understand that it’s happening. This cultural moment is encouraging people to pull their blinders down and really look at what’s going on. My hope is that it will change the diversity issues in Hollywood and that Hollywood will become a more diverse place, but I think it’s encouraging that we have alternative platforms of television—which is making a huge comeback because Hollywood is so boring and dull—online distribution which is even getting around cable networks and all of their balkanized interests. But we also have independent filmmaking, you know, and a film like “Moonlight” came out of independent financing, so that’s encouraging. It’s encouraging that it doesn’t take as much money and funding as it used to take to make a film, just because technology has gotten more accessible and easier to use and cheaper than it’s ever been. That will also allow access to groups that traditionally have not had as much access to filmmaking.
THC: On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have “Mulan,” which is getting a live-action remake. Only an Asian or Asian-American actress will be hired as the main character, but it’s gotten backlash because the director, who is a woman, is a white woman. What do you think of representation behind the camera?
RS: It’s incredibly important, and it’s often hard to make legible because people—unless you’re a film geek—don’t often think about the director. Everyday people who go to see a film like “Mulan” are not thinking about the producer or the casting agent or all of these people whose decision-making goes into what ends up on screen, and the identity of those people, and how their identity affects their ability to represent what’s on screen. If you have a non-Asian-American woman producing a film about Asians, there’s some pantomiming going on there. There’s some equivalence of Scarlett Johansson being cast as an Asian character… That’s why stars are the number one branding agents in the film, and only secondarily are directors branding agents. It takes a certain degree of film savvy to even care who directed a film. People go to franchise films, the next Batman film because that’s a brand. They go to the next Scarlett Johansson film because that’s a brand. But only in a tertiary role would the director’s name or gender or ethnic or racial identity factor into that.
It’s my sense that people go to films mostly on the basis of what’s in them rather than what’s produced them. It’s entirely problematic that we don’t see any diversity in those arenas either because studios don’t allow diversity in those arenas, they shut that diversity out.
THC: What do you think it will take for this momentum of awareness to keep going?
RS: I think we’ve passed a threshold where we’re not going back to complacency—I hope. There is such a thing as resistance or protest fatigue, and I think you’re seeing some of that right now, but I think that awareness is now so deep in us, the injury committed to all of us by the last election and how that corresponded with identity politics is… That cut so deep that I don’t think that injury is going to heal anytime soon. People are going to stay woke for a while. That was already in happening in Hollywood, though. I think it was what pushed Hollywood into realizing this more, and I think now you also see greater funding efforts for minorities in cinema. There’s movement for sure. The O’Reilly firing is a positive symptom of that, that people are not complacent… yet.

For the 2016-2017 season of the Boston Early Music Festival (BEMF), the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin played an energetic show at The New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall. The program performed on March 24, “Of Frogs and Men,” consisted of Baroque music on the theme of nature. These pieces were played delightfully by fifteen players including violins, violas, oboes, a violoncello, a double bass, a bassoon, a lute, a harpsichord, and a recorder, all the while bringing to life the opulence of this style to the stage.
Berlin’s Akademie für Alte Musik was founded in 1982 and performs internationally. They have also produced many award-winning records. Their selections in Boston consisted of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century pieces that, in taking nature as their subject, reflect the age’s scientific curiosity and sense of discovery.
The first piece, which composer’s “Capriccio Stravagante,” started the evening off well with its beautiful movements and humor. In the piece, different instruments imitate familiar sounds from the natural world. The violinists excelled in their use of techniques such as slides or striking the strings with the wood of the bow. The non-imitative sections of  music were less humorous but just as lively and blithe. The part in which two violins imitated a hen and a rooster was the most amusing, with each player bobbing along pompously and adding to the comic effect.
Also notable was Zelenka’s “Hipocondrie à 7 concertanti in A major,” which featured the two oboe players. This work stood out because of the group’s ability to subtly adapt to the different moods within the piece, such as the vibrancy of the “Allegro” or the more grave and grand undertones of the “lentement.” This nimble playing highlighted the piece’s different moments of counterpoint as well as the many points of dissonance that complicate the overall work, which made it more striking and unusual amidst the more harmonic dance selections. The piece transported the audience to a 17th-century court.
The most outstanding part of the performance was the recorder in Vivaldi’s “Il Gardellino,” played by Anna Fusek. Her tone was rich and clear to resemble the songbird after which the piece is named. Fusek played so lightly and effortlessly that her music seemed to flutter around the center of the stage. Her energy was so infectious that even the other players had difficulty keeping their eyes away from her.
The rest of the pieces were just as well-played and cohesive within the scheme of the program. At the end of the program, The Akademie played a wonderful encore of  a short Vivaldi opus as well as a dance-folk song that ended the evening on an even greater high as audience members clapped along to the jig-like tune. Beyond the pieces themselves, the enjoyment and excitement of the players were truly contagious.

This semester the biannual Harvard Public Opinion Project asked millennials the same questions about their voting habits it has asked for nearly two decades, yielding familiar results: A substantial proportion of millennials praise the importance of voting, don’t vote, and then don’t tell the truth about it when asked. According to the most recent survey conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics, 74 percent of surveyed Americans aged 18 to 29 rank voting as the best method for producing change, yet they turn out to vote in only mediocre numbers.  
This year, 65 percent report they voted, but, according to Brookings, only half of eligible Millennial voters actually did. How can a demographic that self-reports as politically conscious, advocates for change, and lauds the power of the ballot be counted on to vote only half the time? Welcome to the Harvard Public Opinion Project, where we analyze the land of peculiar politics where apathy meets activism.
Yesterday, April 25, marked the release of the 32nd Harvard Political Survey of Young Americans. The survey polled over 2,000 18- to 29-year-olds to investigate their political attitudes. The survey is supervised by Harvard IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe and staffed by a team of undergraduates, of which I was a member. At the beginning of the semester, we drafted questions to gauge Millennials’ attitudes about everything from the specifics of President Donald Trump’s policies to the reputability of political media. Since then, we’ve been analyzing the results.
Beyond the horserace numbers (Trump’s favorability rating stands at 32 percent among young Americans, for example), the poll captures an odd mixture of apathy and activism, a worrying but remediable trend among my generation.
Let’s start with the positives. Presumably spooked by the rise of Trump and excited by Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential bid, millennials report that politics is more relevant than ever. In fact, only 16 percent agree with the statement “Politics is not relevant to my life right now.” Moreover, only 22 percent agree that political involvement rarely has any tangible results.
Internet media has made politics more accessible than ever. The survey reports that the percentage of people who have used Facebook to “like” and follow a political candidate has nearly doubled since 2012 (34 percent to 65 percent). More millennials also report using Facebook and Twitter to advocate for a political position. It makes sense that the politically conscious would follow public officials and important causes on Facebook.
But political advocacy has a “slacktivism” problem. It seems that this focus on online armchair activism is comfortable, not cogent. So much of our discourse online reverberates in liberal or conservative echo chambers. If you have a bunch of liberal friends, you’re going to see a lot of liberal content. Often, expressing support for a candidate is just preaching to the choir. This kind of online activism, which sometimes passes as “raising awareness,” will achieve very little if, as the survey reports, millennials estimate that 50 percent of their Facebook News Feed is fake news.
Armchair activism explains the survey’s seemingly paradox: that a renewed interest in politics is being paired with an aversion to engaging with it. More and more people find the prospect of working in public service unappealing. Going outside the political system by protesting does not seem to have much appeal either. Millennials rank attending a protest the lowest among six ways of producing change in America. It came behind voting, talking about important issues, volunteering for community service, calling their political representatives, and running for office.
This apathy likely stems from an erosion of trust in our public institutions. The survey reports declining trust in the U.S. military, the president, Congress, and the federal government. They are falling to even lower levels of support from already mediocre 2012 highs. A measly 24 percent of young Americans trust the President to do the right thing. More than half of millennials believe that “elected officials don’t share my same priorities” and 43 percent agree with the statement “Politics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing.”
These results should be a wake-up call. The desire to change is out there. It is encouraging that young Americans want to advocate for political change.
So what concrete changes can average politically conscious citizens make? They could sign up to canvass for a favorite candidate or donate to an up-and-coming campaign. They could attend town hall meetings with local representatives and vote in local elections. Here at Harvard, they could sign up for Harvard College Democrats or Republicans and work to support an agenda with like-minded students. They could volunteer at the IOP or even help with the next edition of the survey. None of these steps on their own is going to solve our apathy problem, but at least they will address the root causes and not bemoan the symptoms of our disengagement.
The results of the survey suggest that there is still time for millennials to become a political generation. To be effective, we have to get off our keyboards and do the things we claim to hold in such high esteem.

In the Office of Faculty Development and Diversity’s annual report, published yesterday, administrators announced that women and faculty of color now make up 39.2 percent of tenured professors, an increase of 8.4 percent since 2008.
Faculty diversity at Harvard is an issue we often feel compelled to discuss, given the challenges the University and its students have encountered in the perennial effort to make progress. These recent internal studies and surveys about the University’s hiring practices make clear that the faculty does not adequately or appropriately reflect the campus.
Harvard is fortunate to boast a student body drawn from numerous backgrounds by virtue of its long reach, but efforts at representation cannot stop there. It is true that the relative homogeneity of the faculty is a larger institutional trend in academia, and Harvard is not necessarily to blame. But just as a lack of diversity was once—but no longer—a reality for the student body, we believe Harvard must continue its efforts to broaden the faculty as well.
We hope the College recognizes that this is an effort that goes beyond recruitment and hiring. Recent surveys have shown that the percentage of tenured female and minority faculty has increased from 30 perecent to nearly 40 percent over the past decade. While we celebrate this progress, the qualitative experience of faculty matters too. In particular, feelings of isolation and separation must be recognized and resolved.
Tenure-track faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds have had unique challenges in growing their representation, increasing only by 1 percent—to 11 percent—in the past decade. Those who received tenure saw only a 3 percent boost during the same time period, from 5 to 8 percent. This uptick, while positive, does not alleviate our concern that a single-digit percentage leaves the issue unresolved. Harvard must focus on ways it can retain these individuals from different backgrounds when awarding tenure.
The importance of faculty expands far beyond the classroom. Many students count faculty members as mentors, counselors, and advisers; it is only appropriate that the students who often do not feel that they belong can find someone to whom they can relate and who can assist them. The University should especially prioritize providing this support for students whose backgrounds are underrepresented in academia—it is crucial that students see themselves reflected in the individuals who have the greatest influences on their education.
In addition to the advantages for the student body, a diverse faculty promises considerable benefits for the field of research as well. Collaboration and the pursuit of knowledge is vital to any institution of higher learning, and researchers are better suited to create knowledge in groups that have more perspectives around the table.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zoe: The lessons began before I even hit puberty. They came in the form of comments to cover up a body that was quickly transforming into something that could attract unwanted male attention. Attention, I was taught, wouldn’t come if I acted like a proper lady. I was warned to expect eyes on my body, crawling like bugs up and down my limbs, taking without permission. No amount of clothing layered on top of skin seemed to be enough to prevent the violation I would feel. Violation that would keep my heartbeat racing, my steps moving a little bit quicker, my eyes shifting to the ground, and sending prayers that somehow I would become invisible. I learned through firsthand experience that it didn’t take much for a gaze to become hands touching without consent. It was the first time I realized part of my being a woman meant always anticipating what a man around me might do next, it meant living, without choice, in a machista world.
Ruben: I was thirteen years old and my body was changing. I had to start wearing deodorant and was convinced that my brain was broken because I couldn’t stop thinking about that girl in my class. The awkward videos about how puberty worked started to make sense. I’d barely left childhood—although most men act like children until at least their early 30s—but I was suddenly bombarded with questions about my sex life. Sometimes they came from sweaty, brown-skinned teammates whose grossly explicit fantasies about smashing girls hinted at an upcoming lifetime of violent masculinity. But, much more often, the questions were implicit and from family members. They’d ask if I had a girlfriend, make suggestive comments when I said I didn’t, and treat me like I was a full-fledged, girl-crazy, conquest-prone, machista adult before I even knew what a blowjob was. Machismo was thrust upon me like an old coat, one that I wore because it was bequeathed even though it fit uncomfortably.
Z: I don’t have enough fingers to count the number of times I’ve been catcalled, had besitos thrown at me, and been made painstakingly aware that as a woman, as a Latina, I am a target for a unique form of multilingual machismo that comes in all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, and languages—Spanish, English, Spanglish. I’ve learned no place is safe. Including that time I was sweetly sixteen heading home from school with traffic creeping along at a snail's pace, every second seeming to take longer to pass than the last. Music blasting, smiling without a care, my windows rolled down, and the sun beating on my back—can be a recipe for attracting attention I don’t want. Attention that pulls up next to me in a van of Latinos old enough to be my tíos. They smile, but I’ve learned looks can be deceiving. Their gazes soon turn into stares backed up by whistles I don’t want to hear. They’re shouting, “¿Como te llamas?” and I wish they would just go away. I want them to stop. I roll up my windows, my smile gone.
Ruben: Ratty, outdated, unnecessary machismo makes life a danger for women. Women are instructed to walk in pairs. They’re asked to make themselves less visible. They’re blamed when machismo makes men feel like they can assault women. Latinas are expected to be sexual objects for consumption—the fiery maids and lovers with an accent—but at the same time also supposed to be saintly mothers. Machismo builds an impossible double standard for Latina women. Deviating from the standard leads to very real, and often violent, effects on women. Rape, fear, and domestic abuse find a home in Latinx households because machismo is allowed free reign. Its presence is never questioned.
Z: Machismo is learning that being a woman means working extra hard to make sure that safety is a reality. It is being expected to be an amazing cook, have a career, and not carry too many opinions. It means lying about having that novio to ward away men, because, when you’re a woman, who you are—your worth as a person—isn’t tied to the words borne from your lips, but the ring that should be resting on your finger and the man to whom you supposedly belong. It is a culture weaved through every interaction with Latinos, from the way they talk over you, because of course, their words carry more weight, to the way they act like “no” is a suggestion in need of persuasion, to the way they grab without permission. It is a tradition that is so ingrained in Latinas, who teach every new generation to be more fearful than the last, passing down what seems like a survival kit comprised of warnings that when ignored could spell a violation that can’t be undone. Being a man shouldn’t mean you have the right to ignore my basic humanity simply because I’m a woman. Being a Latina does not make me voiceless and it is time that Latinos are taught to listen, or machismo will always exist: an immortal living, breathing monster haunting Latina lives.
R: I’ve benefited from machismo. I’ve been allowed out of the house much more freely than my younger sisters have. There was never a question about my desire to have a career—el hombre macho has to sustain the household, right? I can smash whomever, hurt whomever, emotionally wreck whomever, and my culture says it’s okay. Machismo is a free pass in life and giving that up is hard. But, ultimately, brown boys everywhere will have to do so. Too often Latino men, myself included, find it easy to say machismo is unavoidable because our parents grew up in Catholic countries where it’s expected. Our fathers and tíos brought it from El Salvador in their luggage, and we claim there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s too ingrained in our culture. But that excuse is too convenient and too selfish to work for much longer. There’s a way of preserving a sweet, Salvadorean, Mexican, or Latin American culture while getting rid of its painful, violent, oppressive components for the benefit of men and women yet to be born into it. There’s a way of rethinking our machista world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 25, 2017 at 8:00 p.m.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana unveiled the next Faculty Deans for both Dunster and Mather House in an email Tuesday.
L. “Maha” Mahadevan—a professor of Applied Mathematics, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, and Physics—and Amala Mahadevan, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, will serve as Faculty Deans of Mather House.
Sean D. Kelly and Cheryl Chen, both faculty members in the Philosophy department, will serve as Faculty Deans of Dunster House. Kelly and Chen will move into Dunster with their two children, ages 12 and 7.
The new Faculty Deans will take their posts beginning next academic year.
“We’re incredibly excited about it,” Kelly said. “We loved everything that we saw about Dunster House. Our whole family is just incredibly thrilled to have that in our future.”
These appointments in the neighboring River Houses come after current Mather Faculty Deans Michael D. Rosengarten and Christie McDonald announced their retirements in Dec. 2016. Dunster Faculty Deans Roger B. Porter and Ann R. Porter announced in March 2017 that they would also step down at the end of the academic year.
McDonald and Rosengarten were at Mather for seven years, while the Porters led Dunster House for 16 years.
In an email sent to the Faculty Deans of Harvard’s 12 residential undergraduate Houses, Khurana announced the new appointments, writing that he was “delighted that these four thoughtful and talented members of our Harvard community will be serving as faculty deans.”
“They are devoted teachers, scholars, and community members who are deeply committed to ensuring that each Harvard house feels like a home where students can bring together their academic, social, and personal passions and pursuits,” Khurana wrote.
L. “Maha” Mahadevan, a professor in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, also serves as the SEAS Area Dean for Applied Mathematics. He has previously taught at MIT and Cambridge University in England.
Amala Mahadevan is an oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a leading marine science research center. She also is on the faculty of the institute’s Joint Program in Oceanography with MIT.  She studies carbon cycle in the ocean and climate change.
The Mahadevans have two children, both of whom are students at Harvard College.
Kelly’s scholarship in philosophy focuses on phenomenological and cognitive neuroscientific aspects to the human experience. He has also taught courses on French and German philosophical works. Before coming to Harvard, he taught at Stanford and Princeton.
Kelly recently chaired the committee tasked with overhauling the College’s General Education requirements.  Kelly said this engagement sparked an interest in the residential House system at Harvard.
“In thinking about [the Gen Ed program], and exploring the history of Gen Ed at Harvard, I came to realize what an important role Houses play, and are intended to play in the whole educational experience at the College.  And I found that really intriguing and exciting,” Kelly said.
Chen’s work focuses on philosophy of mind and epistemology. She is also interested in the philosophy of religion. She also serves as the Associate Head Tutor in the philosophy department.  Before coming to Harvard, she was an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College.
In his email, Khurana also thanked McDonald, Rosengarten, and the Porters for their time served as Faculty Deans—formerly called House Masters until the name was changed last year.
“We were all fortunate to have them in these roles for so many years – and they will be truly missed,” Khurana wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WASHINGTON, D.C.—University President Drew G. Faust said the renown of American universities is “contingent” on continued federal support during a panel discussion with university presidents in the nation’s capital Tuesday.
The trip to Washington was Faust’s third in 2017 and was timed to coincide with the Association of American Universities semiannual meeting of university presidents. Faust attended off-the-record AAU meetings, met with lawmakers, and spoke at the panel hosted by the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.
During the panel, Faust fielded questions from David Rubenstein, a billionaire financier and philanthropist who is president of the Economic Club and the Harvard Corporation’s newest member. She sat alongside Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne and Ohio State president Michael V. Drake.
In an interview after the event, Faust emphasized the importance of government backing for American colleges and universities.
“I hope people took away how important institutions of higher education are within the United States, that they are a kind of gem of American society and of our country, and that they’re not inevitable—that they need to be supported, that there are ways in which they could be at risk if we don’t sustain the values and the value that is inherent in them,” Faust said.
An eclectic mix of roughly 300 people—including university representatives, lawyers, corporate leaders, and ambassadors from places as far-flung as Tunisia and Lichtenstein—gathered for the event in a Marriott ballroom.
Rubenstein’s questions alternated between facetious and serious, as he asked the presidents about issues including admissions, federal policies, and campus sexual assault. Certain questions were tailored for each school—to Faust, Rubenstein asked about the University’s capital campaign and loss of a talented basketball recruit to Duke.
In response to Rubenstein’s question about the most serious challenge facing universities today, Faust echoed Drake’s commitment to balancing “access, affordability, and excellence,” adding that universities must find a way to better publicize that commitment.
“We’re not communicating that effectively to the wider public,” she said. “I think one of our biggest challenges is to explain who we are, and what we do, and why it matters. And that will determine whether we are able to pursue these three goals.”
Support from legislators and philanthropists, Faust said, is essential. She referenced proposed federal budget cuts to scientific research funding as one area of concern for her and other higher education leaders.
The budget blueprint President Donald Trump proposed in March would cut funding for the National Institute of Health by roughly 20 percent and the Environmental Protection Agency by 31 percent, in addition to completely eliminating funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts. Harvard’s administrators and faculty have decried the cuts as potentially “devastating.”
Research funding cuts featured prominently in the AAU spring meeting Faust attended on Monday. After that meeting, the AAU released a statement on behalf of the presidents and chancellors of its member universities that issued a dire warning to lawmakers about the impact of the cuts.
“This would cripple our ability to do our part in generating economic growth and providing more jobs for Americans,” the statement reads. “If these cuts are enacted, the partnership that has been reinforced through both Republican and Democratic administrations over the past 70 years could literally collapse.”
Faust said in an interview weeks after the 2016 presidential election that she would be “ramping up” advocacy efforts—a pledge that would mean more trips to Washington. In January and February, she met with lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. She also wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about the importance of NEH funding.
She declined to comment on which lawmakers she met with during this trip.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four Harvard Law School students are demanding that the Law School clarify how it considers applicants who have been accused or found guilty of sexual assault.
Emma K. O’Hara, Shayna Medley, Dixie C. Tauber, and Kelly Jo Popkin ’11—all third-year law students in the school’s Gender Violence Policy Workshop—published the article in the Harvard Law Record Sunday, attaching a questionnaire they sent to Law School admission officers March 30.
In both the op-ed and the questionnaire, the students ask that the admissions officials disclose the information they collect from applicants about past accusations and convictions of sexual assault. They also ask that School publicly comment on how it considers that information.
“I think we were all sort of motivated to want to do this particular topic now given that it’s admissions season,” Tauber said. “We thought that this is important information that potential incoming students would want to know. We all debated whether some of this information would have changed our opinions on whether to come to Harvard Law.”
The questionnaire was addressed to the Law School’s Jessica L. Soban ’02—an associate dean who directs the Law School’s admissions—Director Thomas E. Robinson, Associate Director Anne M. Taylor, and Assistant Director Nefyn Meissner.
Medley said the writers weren’t necessarily seeking a change in school policy, but rather increased clarity regarding the Law School’s policies.
“At a baseline we want this to be a call for transparency,” Medley said. “We recognize that we don’t have all the answers and that this is a really complex issue, but to have an administration that is at least responsive to these kind of questions.”
Prior to The Crimson reaching out to Soban on April 24, the authors had received no response to their questionnaire. On April 25, Soban responded to their initial email.
In both the response email to the students and in an emailed statement to The Crimson, Soban wrote that the admissions office takes the safety of Law School students seriously.
“In our application, we ask questions that help us to evaluate the character and fitness of applicants, not just for entry into the HLS community, but also for entry into the practice of law,” Soban wrote. “Inquiries into academic or professional misconduct or into criminal charges are undertaken in accordance with state and federal laws, which include relevant privacy statutes. We consider all information available to us, and we make admissions decisions based on that information.”
In response, O’Hara wrote in an email that they found the school’s response lacking in the concrete information they had requested.
“We put forth a call for transparency and affirmative efforts demonstrating the school takes sexual assault seriously,” O’Hara wrote. “We assume that HLS acts in compliance with state and federal law, but hope HLS will treat state and federal law as a floor, not a ceiling, on students' rights to guide the admissions process.”
Sexual assault cases and compliance have been controversial at the Law School in the past. A sexual assault complaint involving two Law School students was featured in “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary that covers sexual assault on college and university campuses. The federal government found the school in violation of Title IX in 2014, a decision that many professors at the school have criticized.

Former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon reflected on his tenure leading the UN and discussed issues he characterized as of global importance, such as nuclear weapons and climate change, at Harvard's Institute of Politics Tuesday.
Ban, who served as Secretary-General of the UN from 2007 to 2016, spoke at length Tuesday about the challenges that came with his former position. He joked that people often viewed him as a “scapegoat” and as the public face of the UN, and that he finds his new position as a fellow at the Kennedy School to be less demanding.
“Most of the UN staff address me like ‘SG’ instead of Secretary-General because it is too long. At the same time, ‘SG’ stands for ‘scapegoat.’ Whatever goes wrong, that’s all the United Nations Secretary-General’s fault,” he said. “I don’t think many media will be interested in reporting what I will say now, and I am in a much more relaxed position.”
Ban emphasized, though, that he considers the work of the United Nations—an intergovernmental body that mediates global conflicts and has representatives from 193 countries—to be incredibly important. Ban said that the UN helped his family survive in war-torn Korea, where he grew up.
“When I was a boy during the Korean War in [the] 1950s, the United Nations saved my family, my country, and myself,” Ban said.
He also spoke on contemporary issues, such as ongoing conflicts between North Korea and other nations, the threat of nuclear weapons, and climate change.
Ban said he thinks other countries should place economic sanctions on North Korea to eliminate the threat of war with the reclusive nation. On environmental issues, Ban followed other politicians in characterizing climate change as a threat to safety and peace across the world.
“The people in the world seemed to believe we have two planet Earths—but unfortunately we have only one,” he said, adding that he considers mitigating climate change to be one of the most important issues of his time on the United Nations.
Speaking to Harvard affiliates at the event, Ban encouraged students to take action to hold government officials accountable.
“Many leaders failed you, and many leaders are still failing you. Now is the moment for you to demonstrate a new way of approaching global problems, and prove the power of global citizenship for the sake of a common future,” Ban said.
He added that he thinks students should also uphold compassion in their work in public service.
“I think most of you have a lot of passion, strong passion. But I’m asking you, this passion... should be compatible with compassion, respect for others, consideration, compassion for other people.”
Ban recently joined the Kennedy School as an Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow, and received a Masters in Public Administration from the school in 1985.

Amy Goodman ’84, the host and executive producer of the news show Democracy Now!, discussed the role of an independent press in resisting President Donald Trump's administration in Science Center E Tuesday.
In her roughly hour-long talk, Goodman—who was introduced by brother and fellow journalist David L. Goodman ’82—discussed her book, also titled “Democracy Now!” and lodged pointed criticisms against the mainstream media.
Goodman began her lecture recounting her show’s 20-year-long history, touching on various issues such as police brutality, climate change and capital punishment in the mid-to-late 90's. She also spoke of her belief in the media’s potential for good.
“I think the media can be the greatest force for peace on earth. Instead, all too often, it is wielded as a weapon of war. Which is why we have to take the media back,” Goodman said.
Goodman pointed to the Iraq war as an example of mainstream media biases. Citing a study of news coverage in the lead-up to the Iraq War, Goodman said mainstream broadcasters gave a skewed perspective of public opinion on a potential invasion.
“How many [of those interviewed by mainstream broadcasters] do you think were with anti-war leaders or peace leaders? Half the population for and half against [invading Iraq]? Three. Three out of almost 400. That’s no longer mainstream media. That’s extreme media beating the drums for war,” Goodman said.
Goodman added that she believed that the public’s interests are not appropriately informed by the mainstream media.
“I really do think that those who are deeply concerned about war and peace, those who are concerned about the growing inequality in this country, those who are concerned about climate change, the fate of the planet, those who are concerned about social, economic, racial injustice are not a fringe minority,” Goodman said. “Not even a silent majority. But a silenced majority silenced by the corporate media,”
Christopher-Michael “Spike” Daeley, a linguistics graduate student from the University of Massachusetts Boston and self-described avid follower of Democracy Now! since 2011, said he was delighted to meet Goodman.
“It was a real treat to come in and finally see Amy because her voice gets me up in the morning and is something I hear throughout the day," Daeley said. "The tireless work that she, Juan González, and the folks at Democracy Now! [do] really keeps me going and keeps me energized to be active in society.”

Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria pushed back on the conclusions of a heavily-publicized new book that criticizes the Business School’s alleged complicity in a number of societal ills, calling some of the book’s claims “overstated” in an interview Tuesday.
“The Golden Passport,” written by financial journalist Duff McDonald and published Tuesday, argues that the Business School has helped advance a corporate culture of greed, repeatedly destabilizing the American economy in the singular pursuit of increasing shareholder value.
McDonald contends that Business School professors, many of whom have corporate backgrounds, have pushed a corporate curriculum distant from the school’s original mission of educating responsible business managers.
Nohria, who has taught at the Business School since 1988, took a different view. While he has only so far read some excerpts of the book and reviews of it, Nohria argued that the Business School has made positive contributions to the American economy since its founding.
“In many ways I think the book doesn’t give justice to the many ways in which Harvard Business School is trying—and not just today, but has always tried since the beginning of its history—to remind its graduates that as business leaders they have a deep and important relationship with society, and that the health of society is something that is their responsibility,” he said.
Nohria said that the book, which has earned some media attention, overlooks the positive contributions of Business School alumni to society.  For example, a 2016 Impact Study found entrepreneurial graduates of Business School responsible for creating nearly 11 million jobs worldwide as well as $2.4 trillion in revenue.
“We have people who are social entrepreneurs, we have people who serve society in myriad ways, we have people who are soldiers, bankers, activists, CEOs. There are lots and lots of ways in which our alumni provide goods, services, employment and various other things to society. So I think that to argue that all the evils of society can be blamed on HBS seems to me a little overstated,” he said.
Nohria went on to cite a number of popular courses, from “Reimagining Capitalism” to “Leadership and Corporate Accountability,” that, contrary to McDonald’s argument, push students to equally consider ethical and legal dimensions as well as economic ones.
He also noted that the Business School is a pioneer in the field of social enterprise, a strategy that aims to maximize human and environmental health.
Nohria also challenged McDonald’s argument that the Business School professors focus on maximizing shareholder profits. He said several professors at the Business School have challenged that management theory.
“For twenty years they have been talking about how shareholder value maximization is not the best way of thinking about what management needs to do. So our own faculty are writing those articles and they’re not just writing them now. This is an idea that has been a part of HBS for a long time,” he said of McDonald’s shareholder argument.
“Nothing could be further from the truth,” he added.
However, Nohria said that, to some degree, the message of the book is, in some ways, consistent with what the Business School teaches.
“To the extent that the author wants to say that when things go wrong in society, it is the responsibility of leaders to be attentive to that and think about how they might address some of the problems in society,” Nohria said. “We, as the Harvard Business School, should be always vigilant for that too. And we try to do that in every way we know how.”

Flashing blue lights and blaring music set an energetic tone for the 20th Annual Harvard Business School New Venture Competition held Tuesday in a nearly packed Burden Hall.
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates, as well as students from four local high schools, attended the event to watch the finalists of the New Venture Competition—in which this year over 280 teams competed for funding for their startup ideas—pitch their projects and vie for “crowd favorite” awards.
This year’s 12 finalists included Freeflow, a medical device to prevent hospital-acquired infections, Apli, a chatbot designed to connect employers with qualified employees, and CozyKin, an app to help parents find and share childcare providers in their communities. The three $75,000 prize winners were Flare, a wearable device that can place phone calls to users hoping to escape an awkward date, Veho, an app that connects freelance package deliverers, and Apli.
For the first time this year, the competition included “crowd favorite” awards, which were decided by an online vote at the end of each of the competition’s three categories. Winners of the crowd favorite award took home a $5,000 prize. Apli won one of the three crowd favorite awards. Juva Therapy, an app that aims to help patients build relationship with their therapists, and CozyKin took home the other crowd favorite awards. Both projects also earned the $25,000 runner-up prize in their respective categories. Vention, a custom machine design service, won the third runner-up prize.
“The New Venture Competition has always been an inspiration for almost all the startups at HBS and Harvard campus so this is an opportunity for us to follow our heroes and get to share… our vision for childcare,” said Jeremy Au, a member of the CozyKin team.
Though teams had had 30 minutes for their initial pitches to the competition’s judges on April 1, they were given just 90 seconds to present to the crowd at Tuesday’s event. Though some teams were forced to stop abruptly at the 90 second mark, others precisely timed their closing statements.
“Juva has the potential to help the over 44 million Americans suffering from mental health to get better faster,” Qian Qian S. Tang said at the end of her team’s presentation.
Some chose to end with memorable slogans.
“It’s a buzzkill,” said Andrew Rothaus at the end of their pitch for Hour 72, a long-lasting bug spray.
Early in the event, host and comedian Norm Laviolette poked fun at the Business School, joking that the school churns out consultants and financiers, not startups.
“[Venture Capitalists] will tell you that you should have two founders. One, if not both, should have technical experience. But Harvard? Harvard will tell you that’s actually not true,” said Laviolette to laughter from the crowd. “Six founders is fine, and if they worked at McKinsey but none of them know how to code? Even better.”
Director of Alumni Clubs and Associations for Harvard Business School Mary-Helen Black, however, praised the New Venture Competition for spurring entrepreneurship at the school.
“The New Venture Competition has become the capstone event for HBS entrepreneurs,” Black said. “Over 4,900 students and alumni comprising over 1,700 teams have competed in the competition since 1997 and HBS has given out over $2 million in prizes.”

Harvard Business School will no longer look to fulfill a pledge to double the percentage of female protagonists of case studies after finding that an initial study underestimated that percentage, according to Business School Dean Nitin Nohria.
At an event in 2014 celebrating the 50th year since the Business School began admitting women, Nohria pledged to double the number of female protagonists in classroom case studies by 2019. But in an interview Tuesday, Nohria said “people got very hung up about the numbers,” and that he instead hopes to increase diversity at the Business School more broadly.
The original goal aimed to match case study protagonists with the number of female senior managers in the United States, which is currently around 20 percent. In 2014, the Business School estimated that around 10 percent of case study protagonists were women.
However, Colleen Ammerman, who directs the school’s Gender Initiative to increase female representation at the Business School, said administrators initially misidentified the percentage of female protagonists. Instead, she said women already comprised roughly 20 percent of case study protagonists in 2014, making it more difficult to double the percentage than some originally thought.
Nohria said Tuesday that he sees the numerical aspect of the Business School’s charge for gender equity to be less important than its broader principles.
“The real purpose of this was never a numerical goal: the real purpose of it was to say it’s important for us to be mindful that our curriculum itself conveys to people who they think should be in leadership roles,” he said.
Nohria added that the Business School will continue to push for greater representation of women in the classroom.
“We’re not stopped, we’ve not got complacent, and we’re not saying we’re done. We’re still trying to improve on every dimension that is possible. It’s an ongoing commitment,” he said.
The attempt to increase women protagonists is part of a larger initiative within the Business School that conducts research on factors that may hinder success of women and people of color in business.
The Gender Initiative, chaired by Business School professor Robin J. Ely, brings together faculty across disciplines to research gender inequities in business and other professional industries.
“We start an initiative so that our research will have more impact on the area as a whole than the sum of the parts,” Ely said, adding she hopes the initiative’s work will eventually close the gender gap in Business School admissions.
Currently, 43 percent of Business School’s Class of 2018 are women, compared to 41 percent from the Class of 2015.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Harvard football played a full-contact game, over 30,000 people crammed the stands, close to 100 Yale opponents filled the sidelines, and the world came crashing to a halt.
Five months later, that 21-14 defeat to the Bulldogs still hurts. The roar of visiting fans—strangely jubilant, for once—has not fully receded. The past is everywhere.
On Saturday night, however, the Crimson held an exorcism. The team suited up for an intra-squad scrimmage, capping three months of training and inaugurating the 2017 season.
With temperatures stuck in the 40s, the Spring Game felt more like winter. But no matter—Harvard is back, and back with a mission.
“The spring is a grind,” sophomore wide receiver Henry Taylor said. “The best part about the grind, though, is that you’re with your buddies…. If you get through with guys that you really respect and love as brothers, it brings a sense of pride.”
At other schools, the first-team offense battles the second-team defense and vice versa. But at Harvard Stadium, the two first-team units faced off (offense in white, defense in crimson), as did the two second-team units.
The first-team defense won the heavyweight battle, holding the offense scoreless and forcing two turnovers. Equally dominant, though, was the second-team offense, which racked up 31 points in slightly more than three quarters.
Importantly, the starting lineup is quicksand. Injuries, practice performance, and coaching decisions will shift personnel until the season opener.
“Competition is always healthy for improvement,” captain Luke Hutton said. “You play better football when you have someone nipping at your heels and competing for your job.”
Still, for fans salivating at the prospect of a September tailgate, the Spring Game offered juicy hints of what awaits.
NO TACKLING DUMMIES
Midway through the second quarter, a missile from quarterback Tommy Stewart slammed into the hands of safety Tim Haehl. The junior dropped the ball.
Haehl stopped and shook his head. After three seasons, he and the rest of the experienced secondary have higher standards.
On this night, redemption came less than 15 minutes later. On the first play of the third quarter, Haehl again undercut a route. This time he grabbed the pass, returning the pick to the opponent’s 17-yard line.
Harvard expects that kind of production in the fall, as the program returns a loaded linebacker core and secondary.
“The big thing is that we have experience this year,” Hutton said. “We didn’t have it last year…. When you have guys that have played 10 games that are coming back, it’s huge for how well you’re going to play.”
Hutton leads the linebackers. Although teammate Eric Ryan graduates this May, the talented senior suited up for only five games in 2016 due to injuries. Junior Chase Guillory, sophomore Anthony Camargo, and freshman Jordan Hill all will take the field for the Crimson.
The secondary boasts even more experience. Last season, junior Tobe Ezekoli and sophomore Wesley Ogsbury earned their chops as one-on-one cover guys. Senior Raishaun McGhee, who is taking off the spring to preserve eligibility, rounds out the unit. And safeties Haehl, Zach Miller (junior), and Cole Thompson (sophomore have all flashed promise.
And then there’s Tanner Lee—the do-it-all junior who emerged as a safety and plug-and-go linebacker last year. He led the program with four interceptions.
In the Spring Game, the all-Ivy honorable mention held kicks. Give him a few more months, and Lee may be taking extra points as well.
“[Secondary players] always get heat for not being able to catch,” Hutton said. “I guess they actually can catch and hold down a kick.”
AND HE’S BACK
Arguably the most important offseason headline involved someone who didn’t play on Saturday—quarterback Joe Viviano.
In 2016, the senior started nine games and threw for 15 scores. He averaged 224 yards through the air and nearly 40 on the ground.
In the last three contest, however, Viviano tossed four picks and took 14 sacks. The worst came at Penn, when he threw three first-half interceptions.
Thanks to an Ivy League ruling, Viviano will have a chance to avenge that turmoil. The quarterback missed all junior year because of a broken foot. Now he will return as a fifth-year senior in 2017.
On Saturday, Viviano didn’t take the field. The sophomore Stewart headed the first team instead. In 2016, he started one game—a 27-17 loss to Holy Cross—and racked up a touchdown, an interception, and three fumbles.
Issues of ball security resurfaced this weekend, as the sophomore bobbled the ball on the first snap. He recovered but fumbled again three plays later, this time resulting in a turnover.
To make matters worse, Stewart faced an aggressive defense. Frequently pushed out of the pocket, the quarterback had to scramble and take sacks.
He put together a drive late in the second quarter but didn’t produce points. On a fourth down near midfield, he never saw a wide-open Jack Barann (junior tight end), who had split the seams of the defense. Yells erupted from the offensive coordinator booth.
“Experience, especially for a quarterback, is huge,” Hutton said. “Anytime you go up against the good defense that we have, you’re going to get better…. He’s improved a lot.”
Starting for the second-team offense, freshman Camden Bohn experienced more success. He finished a scorching 10-of-13 for 128 yards, albeit against a less fearsome defense.
FRONT FOUR WANTS MORE
Yes, the defensive line was dominant on Saturday. Players stuffed holes, bullied blockers, and got to Stewart.
Seniority underpinned the performance. Five players shared time, and four were juniors—Scott Evans, Stuart Johnson, Stone Hart, and Tristan Tahmaseb. Sophomore D.J. Bailey, an all-Ivy second-team selection last year, was the lone exception.
“That group in the spring has come a long way,” Hutton said. “Because you have so many high-character guys at that position, they push one another.”
No matter how impressive, the play of the defensive line left two questions. First, how can you know whether preseason promise will translate to in-season excellence? And second, how can you separate actual talent from the semblance of talent when matched up against a lesser unit?
There’s a reason that coaches describe linemen as “playing in the trenches.” Injuries abound. More than four months separate now from the season opener, and none can know who will be healthy come September.
The offensive line demonstrates this lesson. On Saturday, four mainstays didn’t suit up—junior Larry Allen, junior D.J. Mott, junior Mark Goldman, and sophomore Tim O’Brien. A younger core took their place.
“When you’re playing with a lot of young guys, there’s going to be mistakes,” Hutton said. “I’ve been there…. We’re really just looking for effort.”
SLASH IS CASH
Harvard coach Tim Murphy likes to recruit versatility. Specifically, he likes to recruit players who can line up at both running back and wide receiver. These commits are “slashers” because they might appear as “RB/WR” on a roster.
Saturday witnessed the rise of a new slasher—Henry Taylor. Listed as a wide receiver, Taylor started at running back for the second team. He tallied three scores, including a wheel-route reception in the second quarter. The 195-pound Taylor was so open that an offensive coach yelled, “Got him” as soon as the ball snapped.
By the end of the night, Taylor had accumulated 74 yards on 22 carries.
“I couldn’t have done that without the [second-team] O-line, obviously,” Taylor said. “And Cam Bohn played incredibly well. It was easy for me to run based off his play.”
The Crimson sports a couple other slashers. In 2016, freshman Lavance Northington emerged as a regular-down back, and he started Saturday for the first team. In the past, Harvard has also lined up sophomore Adam Scott in multiple positions.
“We run a lot of motions,” Taylor said. “If you have a guy who can come out of the backfield and line up in the slot and run a couple routes, it puts the defense at a disadvantage.”
Yet the Crimson also develops more traditional backs. Although he didn’t play in the Spring Game, junior Semar Smith led the program in rushing last year. And sophomore Noah Reimers fits the more classic profile of a heavyset, grit-and-grind rusher.
As it turns out, you can teach an old dog new tricks: On Saturday, Reimers scored one touchdown—on a reception by the left pylon.
JUSTICE NEVER SLEEPS
A lot changes between football seasons. Players graduate, schemes shift, and rookies age into veterans.
For the past two years, though, at least one constant has survived—the talent of Justice Shelton-Mosley.
In 2015, Shelton-Mosley won Ivy League Rookie of the Year after averaging 114 total yards per game. In 2016, he was a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy first team after topping the team with 71 receiving yards per game. Next season, he will return as a junior to continue that success but also take on new leadership duties.
According to Hutton, he’s not doing half-badly.
“We know he has the physical tools,” the captain said. “What’s been really impressive this offseason is his taking the next step and becoming a leader…. He’s a guy that other guys will follow.”
On Saturday, the wide receiver certainly played a large role. He returned all kicks. Early in the night, he nearly took a kickoff for a touchdown, but thanks to limited-contact rules, a light graze stopped him.
Shelton-Mosley is only part of an athletic receiving corps. Scott was a revelation last season, emerging from injured anonymity to average 64 receiving yards per game. And speedy youngster Cody Chrest (freshman) waits in the wings.
Murphy has not formally named a starting quarterback—as Hutton emphasized, competition will run through the summer. But whoever that final starter is, he will have some impressive weapons at his disposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team (18-16, 9-6 Ivy) stayed in contention for an Ivy League Championship Series bid as it tripped up to Providence, R.I., and swept Brown (13-27, 3-12) in a three-game weekend series, putting the Crimson second in the Ivy North Division behind only Dartmouth (11-24-1, 10-6).
The three victories extended Harvard’s Ivy win streak to five consecutive games. The Crimson’s away record improved to 7-5 as well.
“We stuck to our process and had faith in ourselves and each other to get the job done,” sophomore Nicki Nishizawa said.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
In the final game in Rhode Island, Harvard continued its winning streak with a 5-2 win against the Bears.
The second game of the day was not as smooth as the earlier game, as the Crimson and Brown were stuck in a 2-2 tie going into the sixth inning. Sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively led off the top of the sixth with a double. A sacrifice bunt moved her over to third, but she was unable to score on a subsequent groundout, the second out of the frame.
Bears pitcher Meghan Wimmer’s control faltered after the groundout, as she hit sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer and allowed a free pass to sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich. Junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan capitalized on the bases-loaded opportunity, driving a double to center field to give Harvard a 5-2 advantage.
“The biggest thing that made us successful today was definitely clutch hitting,” Shively said. “We really stuck with the process today and battled every at-bat.”
The Crimson would hold the score with a strong performance by sophomore pitcher Kathleen Duncan, who struck out seven batters to defend the Harvard lead. The Crimson benefitted from two more strikeouts from freshman starter Olivia Giaquinto. The pair of arms only allowed eight hits, one base on ball, and two earned runs in seven innings.
Earlier in the game, the Crimson opened the scoring for the second time this weekend with two runs in the second inning. Singles by Schiffhauer and Rich allowed Harvard to jump out to a 2-0 lead.
Brown fought back in the third inning to level the game at 2-2, and coach Jenny Allard opted to bring Duncan in to evade the scoring threat. The sophomore tossed 4.1 scoreless innings to improve her record to 7-6.
“We kept our energy up in the dugout and on the field,” Shively said. “We were really cheering for one another the whole time, and it was like we had 23 other girls behind us the whole game.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
In the first game on Sunday, the Crimson rolled comfortably past the Bears with impressive performances from all players.
Rich took a walk to open the first inning before Giaquinto, playing first base, hit a single to plate the El Segundo, Calif. native. The strong play continued as Nishizawa hit an infield single to allow Harvard to establish to a 2-0 lead. Giaquinto and Nishizawa led the team offensively, driving in three and one runs, respectively.
As the second inning began, the Crimson scored its final pair of runs on the day after Giaquinto hit a two-run RBI single with the bases loaded and two outs. Harvard ran the bases expertly in the opening game against Brown, with Rich, Kaplan, junior left fielder Dallas Hogan, and sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart all stealing bases.
“We had some people really step up in big situations,” Shively said. “But it wouldn’t have been possible if our pitchers and defense hadn’t done such a good job of keeping them off the bases.”
Harvard didn’t score for the other innings but held its lead for the rest of the game with a standout performance by senior pitcher Taylor Cabe.
The Boiling Springs, S.C. native pitched a two-hit shutout, allowed only two hits, and struck out five batters. In the first six innings, Cabe only allowed two baserunners. The senior wrapped up her phenomenal game by stranding two runners in the bottom of the seventh.
HARVARD 7, BROWN 4
The Crimson rallied for five runs in the top of the seventh inning to post a come-from-behind win in the opening game of the three-part series, starting the trend of positive play on the weekend.
Trailing 4-2 at the start of the seventh, Harvard erupted for four hits and benefited from two errors to put five runs on the board. Kaplan got the inning started by drawing a rare catcher’s interference, and she later scored on a squeeze bunt from Shively. Schiffhauer singled in Lockhart to tie the game, and Nishizawa tacked on two more with a double into the gap in right-center. Later, Hogan reached home on a throwing error, and Schiffhauer crossed the plate to put the Crimson on top, 7-4.
Nishizawa had a breakout game, going 3-for-4 at the plate and driving in four of Harvard’s seven runs. Schiffhauer and Giaquinto added two hits each.
The Crimson was aggressive on the basepaths against Bears catcher Julia Schoenewald. Kaplan, Hogan, and co-captain Giana Panariello each had a stolen base.
Duncan put together a solid start in the circle, throwing five innings and giving up two earned runs. Cabe entered in the sixth and held Brown scoreless in the final two frames.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last July, only one Harvard athlete qualified for multiple events at the U.S. Olympic Trials.
Her name was Gabby Thomas. At the time, she was barely finished her freshman year in Cambridge.
“One of my biggest personal highlights was the Olympic trials,” Thomas said. “I’d never had a feeling like it because I [was] surrounded by motivated, inspiring, and amazing people. I could just focus on what I love.”
At that event, the rookie won her heat in the opening round of the 200-meter dash, finishing in 22.91 seconds. She cut that mark to 22.72 in the semifinals, placing sixth overall in the event. In the 100-meter race, she claimed 26th with a time of 11.35 seconds.
The performance did not secure an Olympic spot. But it was enough to show that the Florence, Mass., native had developed world-class speed.
In less than two years at Harvard, Thomas has already shattered countless records. In fact, for a couple of weeks this spring, she held a world record for the outdoor 200-meter dash.
Reaching new heights is nothing new for the sophomore. A graduate of the Williston-Northampton School, Thomas still has several high school records to her name.
Thomas graduated with three consecutive and seven total New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) titles in the 100-meter dash. In fact, the last time she didn’t win a 100-meter NEPSAC final was in seventh grade. She placed third.
In those days, Thomas still had an interest in soccer. But by senior year of high school, she had shifted her attention to track. She concluded her final year with school records in the 100-meter dash, triple jump, and long jump. To this day, she holds the the NEPSAC record in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.74 seconds. Thomas’ triple jump was good for best in Massachusetts while her long jump was both a state-best and the fifth-farthest leap nationally at 40’7”.
Some athletes struggle to acclimate to the collegiate environment—the increased training and new academic responsibilities. But Thomas began shattering records her freshman year. During the first half of 2016, the rookie set the school and Ivy League records in the indoor 60-meter dash as well as the outdoor 100- and 200-meter dashes. Thomas’ accomplishments extend beyond individual efforts, though, as she was part of4x400 and 4x100 teams that set school bests.
Thomas’ non-running interests helped facilitate the jump to college. A neurobiology concentrator, she must take a range of classes across the life sciences. She also belongs to the Association of Black Harvard Women and the Black Student Association.
Still, her track performance has elevated her beyond the life of a normal student. Last year, at the indoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, Thomas took gold in the 4x400 relay, 60-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and long jump. At the end of the outdoor season, she topped the Ancient Eight in the 4x100 relay, 100-meter dash, and 200-meter dash.
All that dominance resulted in a spot at the NCAA Outdoor Championships in June. The sprinter had a massive showing then, breaking her own Ivy League and Harvard record with a time of 22.47 seconds in the 200-meter dash. She came away from the NCAAs with a third-place overall finish, as well as a first-team All-American honors for the outdoor event.
“One of my biggest personal highlights was the first time at a national setting last year at outdoor nationals,” Thomas said. “I surprised myself with what I could do in this sport.”
Now in her sophomore year, Thomas has already opened the 2016-2017 season with new wins and records.
In early February, Thomas broke the Ivy League indoor record in the 60- and 200-meter dash with times of 7.38 seconds and 23.37 seconds, respectively. Thomas set a new school record in the 100-meter dash, as well, with a time of 11.24 seconds.
As a result, the sophomore became the first Ivy League female to reach the final of the 200-meter dash at the NCAA Indoor Championships. Beforehand, she took second in her heat with a time that was a mere 0.01 off her personal record at the time, 22.88.
“She’s always striving for more,” said freshman and fellow sprinter Karina Joiner, applauding Thomas for her constant drive.
However, Thomas is more than the sum of her track results. Despite all the athletic success, Joiner insists, the near-Olympian comes back from each meet as a relaxed college student.
“[She’s] so successful, [and] yet she’s so grateful and humble,” Joiner said. “It’s something that’s hard to do when you’re at her level...being able to come back to college, after national meets and all the events, and still being so chill.”

Strip clubs and dolla bills? Seems a little trite to us. In not-so-breaking news, the Delphic paid $350 for strippers at a punch event back in 2010. Although this cost came “before tips and extracurriculars,” it seems a little low—they couldn’t get more expensive exotic dancers? Granted, the company name “Shamrock Entertainment” evokes an image of a beer-gutted Bostonian sipping a thick green shamrock shake more than high-class eroticism.
Of course, decorum and leadership could have changed within the Delphic since the racy occasion. To give them the benefit of the doubt, 2010 was a notably poor-taste year for all of us, marred by Bieber hair and jeggings. In case they haven’t quite learned from their mistakes, Flyby has some advice for Final Clubs on punch event activities that aren’t ripped right out of a 1920s playbook:
Topiary Trimming
Initiate punchers with an afternoon of garden grooming. The hedgery outside the Linden Street house could use some TLC, and what better way for a couple dudes to bond than over aesthetic horticulture? Why “play Edward 40-hands” when you could pay homage to the classic film with some landscaping?
Pin the Tail on the Donkey
The blindfolds, the tease, the intrigue. This childhood classic poses as a sexy substitute. Offer up the first slice of ice cream cake as a reward for a successful pin. Ogling the celebratory cake at the end of the game and chasing some pin-up donkey tail? Perfect PG13 fun!
Pony Rides
$325 (under budget!) covers 120 pony rides for up to 50 children to make for a wholesome evening. Do the math, that’s 2-3 rides per (man)child!
Nota Bene: Not the same type of riding advertised by Shamrock Entertainment.

Hard to believe, but it’s nearly May. There’s no disputing the fact that spring is here—or at least, it will be as soon as the rain clears away for good. But it turns out there’s a hidden danger to darty weather that none of us could ever have anticipated. Predators can be camouflaged in the most innocent of places… 
MassWildlife has issued a warning about creatures that will have you locking your doors and windows—flocks of wild turkeys. You read that right. Hide yo’ kids, hide yo' wives, because it’s turkey breeding season and aggressive turkeys everywhere will not hesitate to, um, “strut their stuff.” "How does this affect little old me in my cozy Harvard dorm?" you might be asking. Well, MassWildlife says that turkeys often attack humans that they see as “low in the pecking order.”
Harvard nerds. That’s right.
Stay vigilant. Turkeys don’t discriminate between engineering nerds and Hist & Lit nerds when seeking out prey. Turkeys don’t care if you’re just trying to make it back to your room after a night of cramming. And turkeys especially don’t give a hoot about your Goldman Sachs internship. Beware the shadows lurking in the street corners, especially those of the avian sort. They can smell your fear. When you show up, humiliated and thoroughly pecked, to your next class, everyone will know that turkeys think you’re inferior.
Most Harvard students adore the Harvard turkey, who is something of a campus celebrity. But we advise that you stay well away from our feathery friend until the fall comes around again. Being pecked is simply not worth a selfie.
