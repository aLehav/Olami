After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Sunday, Randy Cohen, The New York Times “Ethicist,” wrote that to give to Harvard is to “offer more pie to a portly fellow while the gaunt and hungry press their faces to the window.” Rather, he argues, if donors truly want to “promote education as a form of social justice,” they should give their money to community colleges, all-black colleges, smaller Catholic schools, and the like.
Of course, Cohen is right to point out that many other institutions of higher learning across the country need donations in order to provide their students with the basic components of a stimulating education. And we echo his call for donors to consider the potential impacts of their gifts before they actually make a donation: All too often, it seems, individuals with the best intentions give to certain causes or institutions only to realize that their donations could have made more of a difference elsewhere.
But Harvard is certainly an institution that  deserves and effectively utilizes the gifts it receives from its supporters. And while we take issue with the minimal impact Cohen believes that donations to Harvard inevitably have, we most object to what is perhaps the crux of his argument, which is that America’s oldest university has less of a “moral claim” on donations than do other colleges and universities with fewer resources.
First of all, any act of philanthropy, in the sense that an individual parts with personal resources for a positive cause in which he or she believes, ought to be equally called “moral.” That Cohen has conceived of a certain schema on which to rank the morality of these identical actions is highly problematic. After all, who is really to judge negatively a person choosing to make a charitable donation? In a dismal economic climate like this one, when charitable giving has reached one of its lowest levels in recent history, it is misguided to complain about the recipients of donations instead of celebrating the few who are still able and willing to part with money for causes they support. Even though he encourages giving elsewhere, Cohen’s claims about the alleged “morality” involved only serve to discourage the few who can still afford to make charitable donations.
And Cohen succumbs to the common misconception that Harvard’s endowment—admittedly still the largest of any university—is merely an ocean of cash that can be accessed on a moment’s notice, which is not at all the case. Sometimes, as the many budget cuts Harvard has made in the last year demonstrate, a wealthy organization still has a very real need for donations.
But perhaps the most confusing part of the piece is why Cohen has chosen to label Harvard as a less “moral” cause than any other. Ultimately, Harvard is one of the most positive organizations that can be found in society, with contributions ranging from groundbreaking academic research to educating many of our nation’s leaders. With perhaps the most generous financial-aid initiative of its kind, the university has actively transformed itself from an enclave of the American social establishment into a vibrant intellectual community filled with individuals from the around the country and across the globe, an instrument of achieving (at least a small part) of the social mobility so central to the American mythos.  Moreover, it is a fallacy to conclude that the organization with the most money, therefore, has the least need.
In this fundamental sense, we fail to see how Harvard has any less “moral claim” on the philanthropic donations it relies on in order to continue serving its very worthy mission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As The Crimson’s only designated copy editor, I came back to school to face the issue that had been confronting most editors all summer: my personal philosophy on health care. As liberals and conservatives in Washington debated the public option, language experts staked out differing positions of their own. In the publishing world, however, what has separated healthcare liberals from health-care conservatives isn’t our political views—it’s our opinion on whether the hot topic itself is one word or two.
Because it’s a question of philosophy, of course, there can’t be a right answer. But in grammar, a field that lives for rules and regulations, it seems strange that there’s no conclusive authority on the subject. As a recreational reader, the copy editor inside me finds that fact frustratingly inconsistent.
The issue is also a personal crisis. I’m a liberal in every sense of the word—political and editorial. I think the Constitution is a living document. I believe in the flexibility and inevitable evolution of language. I even think it’s acceptable to—gasp—split my infinitives. Why, then, do I not embrace the new variant “healthcare”?
Some background is in order. When the term “health care” was first birthed in the early 20th century, no one could deny that it was two words: literally, care with respect to health. As the phrase spread, however, its two components became more intimately linked; soon, the two-word unit became one word unit—complete with its own entry in the dictionary.
You can see where it gets confusing. “Health care” may have technically been two words, but functionally it was one. The distinction was a fine one—and too subtle, apparently, to keep up. Before long, casual writers and professional editors alike started dropping that pesky extra space, transforming what had become a purely semantic nuance into no nuance at all.
The result is a community of editors that’s sharply divided. The New York Times insists on “health care.” Reuters, on the other hand, is an unapologetic convert to “healthcare.” The Oxford English Dictionary—notoriously slow to respond to common usage—lists it as two words. Dictionary.com—with its modern, online perspective—says one. (A search through The Crimson’s archive reveals both.)
The grammatical rule governing phrasal adjectives compounds the confusion (no pun intended); multi-word descriptors (such as “health care”) must be hyphenated when they appear before a noun (as in “health-care reform”).
“Health care” is far from the only contentious compound. There’s the Gchat in which your friend excuses herself with “nevermind.” There’s the e-mail from your TF who wants to “follow-up” with you. There’s the hyphenated “e-mail” itself, which looks normal to-day, but almost certainly won’t to-morrow. These combinations and more have vexed editors for quite a while—but the health-care issue may finally have forced us to confront the idea that they are moving in to stay.
I consider it part of my job at The Crimson to bemoan the destruction of language. It’s tantalizingly easy to assume that the exquisite subtlety of English prose was destroyed by a population too unsophisticated to understand it.
But can I blame the language for simplifying? It’s equally possible that society, in its enlightened wisdom, decided not to split hairs—or word units—where it was pointless to do so. This isn’t just the inescapable evolution of the language, as liberal linguists insist so often; it actually seems like a sensible shift to make.
Yet when I pick up my editing pen, I still maintain “health care” for the noun and “health-care” for the adjective. In other words, I cling to the old rules, even as my progressive personal philosophy knows that they’re inevitably being squeezed out.
This summer, I knew where to stand on the health-care debate before Congress. I didn’t know where to stand on the “healthcare” debate. My order-loving personality wouldn’t allow me to break the rules. But could I really reconcile political liberalism with grammatical conservatism? Wouldn’t that be the ultimate sin for a copy editor—internal inconsistency?
Yet I’m not the only editor to face this paradox. Plenty of copy editors have succeeded in combining a liberal worldview with a stickler’s adherence to tradition. They recognize simply that grammar leaves room to maneuver. Like political liberals, linguistic liberals don’t hate rules; they just define them differently. Rather than dictating every last detail, rules protect the framework in which dissent, change, and possibility can thrive.
As a result, the best copy editors aren’t necessarily conservative, as one might assume; they’re instead those who are aware of the conservative rules and consciously decide how to apply them. I’m personally not ready to switch over to “healthcare”—but it’s not a contradiction to say I won’t get in the way of those who do.

When environmental issues come up in everyday conversation, the U.S. Supreme Court rarely figures in to the discussion.  Most people, environmentalists and non-environmentalists alike, do not consider the court to be an important arbiter of environmental policy in the United States. This, unfortunately, underestimates—sometimes dramatically—the court’s role in shaping environmental laws and regulations.  Like any other public policy in the U.S., this policy faces judicial review, and the justices often shape it very directly through their decisions.
As the justices return to the bench this fall, it is worthwhile for Americans to review its recent legacy in environmental cases.  The two patterns beginning to surface after the first three terms of  the Roberts era do not seem reassuring for environmentalists: relaxed regulation and weakening of historic policies. The only positive aspect of the court’s actions thus far lies in its seeming inclination to take “green” cases.  The Roberts era has seen 12 of these already—nearly triple the number heard in the first three years of the Rehnquist or Burger Courts.  However, if the justices continue to rule against green interests, this hardly qualifies as a positive.
In the 2008-2009 term, the court decided five cases that directly involved environmental regulation and adopted the pro-business position in each of them.  In Coeur Alaska Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, the court opened the doors to drastic reinterpretation of the Clean Water Act.  The majority upheld a Bush Administration ruling, which many experts consider a blatant violation of the spirit of the Clean Water Act, that allows mining companies to dump toxic mine tailings into water bodies so long as they are defined as “fill materials” rather than “waste.”  This ruling could fundamentally alter the way in which government monitors waste discharged into rivers and lakes.  It is also a clear indication that the court prefers to side with plaintiffs who are within the letter of the law, but not the original legislative intent—that of ecological protection.
The justices displayed this same attitude in Entergy v. Riverkeeper.  In this case, several green groups and states sued the Environmental Protection Agency in order to prevent the use of explicit cost-benefit analysis when creating regulations.  The ruling was in favor of the EPA and against what Justice Stevens viewed as the legislative intent of Congress.  In his dissent he wrote: “When Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.”  There is no such language in this bill and, historically, Congress has been wary of allowing cost-benefit considerations in environmental regulatory decisions.  Yet the majority disregarded both the plain intent of Congress and the court’s own historical precedent, choosing instead to overturn the ruling of the Second Circuit justices.
The Entergy case is doubly interesting because the newest member of the bench, Sonya Sotomayor, wrote the opinion that the majority ultimately overturned.  In her decision, she echoed the position that Stevens would eventually voice.  In taking this stance, Sotomayor revealed a jurist willing to remain in line with the legislative intent of the law, if not the exact wording. As she takes her place on the bench, she may help to swing the court back toward a position friendlier to ecological concerns.
The 2009-2010 docket holds only one green case, a decline from previous years. However, as climate-change policy becomes ever more important, the court is sure to exercise an even larger role in environmental policy than it has in the past.  The Roberts era has thus far been marked by both its willingness to hear environmental cases and its lack of sympathy to such causes.  The appointment of Sotomayor may lead to some changes, but it seems unlikely that the court will prove receptive to green interests until at least one more environmentally friendly judge joins the fold.  This makes the environmental stance of the next appointee of vital concern.  As such, activists must participate in a much more central and vocal manner, prodding the decisions of their Senators during the next confirmation hearings.  The bench clearly plays a vital, if hidden, role in American environmental policy and the confirmation of a new, more environmentally receptive justice may stem the rollback of natural protections that the Roberts Court seems intent upon implementing.

Princeton’s endowment shrank by 23 percent this past fiscal year—beating Harvard’s 30 percent loss—but the decrease was buffered by the school’s decision to finance its operating expenses using bonds and other sources of cash, rather than drawing on its endowment.
The move to prioritize and preserve endowment resources at a time when budgetary crises are sweeping higher education sets Princeton apart from its peers. And the decision—which appears to defy calls for schools to spend more from their endowments to sustain services and employment—may actually reflect remarkable foresight and could strengthen Princeton’s future spending capacity.
“To preserve the long-term purchasing power of the endowment, we chose not to transfer funds from the endowment to the operating budget last spring,” wrote Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman in a letter to the community on Tuesday, noting that utilizing the endowment would have required selling equities at unattractive prices. “That has proved to be a wise and prudent decision, given the recent recovery in the markets.”
In January, Princeton raised $1 billion through taxable bond sales. Shortly after, Harvard issued $2.5 billion in debt.
Endowment payout will fund almost half of Princeton’s $1.3 billion operating budget this year.
The Princeton University Investment Company, which manages the school’s endowment, reported investment losses of 23.7 percent this past year—better than the 30 percent loss predicted in the spring. The loss brings the total value of Princeton’s endowment as of June 30 to $12.6 billion, down from $16.3 billion last year.
Despite the better-than-anticipated returns, Tilghman said Princeton will proceed with its plan to reduce the school’s total operating budget by $170 million over this year and the next, and warned that additional layoffs would be needed this fall.
“Our goal in paring down the budget was to preserve the quality of the educational experience of our undergraduate and graduate students, so that no one 25 years from now would say that he or she attended Princeton at a time when opportunities were limited,” she wrote.
Like Harvard, Princeton has implemented salary freezes, halted capital projects, slowed faculty recruitment, and offered a voluntary retirement incentive program for hundreds of staff—initiatives that, along with other budget cutting measures, yielded an $11 million budget surplus last year that will be used to alleviate this year’s cost-cutting.
Tilghman acknowledged that some have criticized the school’s diversified investment portfolio, which includes illiquid assets such as real estate and private equities, for “expos[ing] the University to unacceptable levels of risk.”  She said Princeton would be “reviewing [its] overall investment strategy” to help it weather future severe downturns.
But she noted that in this “once-in-70-year recession,” nearly all investment classes experienced significant losses, and she said that preliminary examinations suggest “marginal, not radical, changes may be warranted.”

Theoretical physicist Adam F. Falk, who received his doctoral degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1991, has been named the 17th President of Williams College, making him only the second scientist to head the school in its 216-year history, according to one member of the presidential search committee.
Currently the Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., Falk, who will officially assume his duties in April, called Williams the “gold standard for liberal arts colleges” in an interview with The Crimson yesterday. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t welcome this opportunity,” he said.
Though Falk currently has no affiliation with Williams, Gregory M. Avis, the chair of the presidential search committee, which began working in January and gave Falk final notification last week, said he believes the physics expert understands Williams’ mission and values.
“Adam impressed us from the beginning with his intellect, passion, and understanding of what a liberal arts education is all about,” Avis said.
Falk will be taking over as the successor to Morton O. Schapiro, an expert in the economics of higher education who left Williams after nine years at the helm to become president of Northwestern University.
Falk is the first scientist to occupy the post since Paul Ansel Chadbourne, a former chair of Chemistry, Botany, and Natural History there, resigned his seat in 1881.
“This is significant. It sends a message to the world that Williams and liberal arts colleges value the sciences,” Avis said.
Still, Falk brings an understanding to his new position that transcends his specialty, according to Michael E. Luke, a former member of Falk’s Harvard graduate class who now chairs the University of Toronto’s physics department. “[Falk] is certainly interested in science, but he has a much broader interest in education as a whole,” Luke said.
“People have this picture of a physicist as being cold and distant. But Falk is a terrific communicator and he’s great at building relationships,” said Jonathan A. Bagger, an associate professor who taught Falk and was later his colleague at Johns Hopkins. “Those abilities will only carry and multiply.”
Falk said he will benefit from his experiences at Harvard in his new position at Williams, citing the parallels between the close-knit liberal arts environment that the school espouses and his own time as a physics student in Cambridge.   “My time at Harvard was spent as a grad student, and that is a very personal education,” Falk said. “The Ph.D. program is a very intimate form of education—a lot of one-on-one work with your professors and fellow grad students.”
“The best time of my life as a student was at Harvard,” Falk added. “That’s the paradigm for all education. That is what it should be.”
Falk won numerous teaching awards both as a Harvard graduate student and later as a professor at Johns Hopkins.
“When he was a [teaching fellow] in grad school his students loved him,” Luke said. “He was very popular.”
Though Falk gained much of his teaching experience at larger universities, Avis said he does not believe Falk’s transition to a small liberal arts college will be very difficult.
“There is a sense of community in rural Massachusetts that is very different from urban Baltimore and that will require an adjustment, but the search committee really trusts in his ability,” Avis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A set of 25-30 paintings, collectively valued at at least $27 million, was stolen from a recently retired Harvard oncologist and his business partner on Friday at their rented home in Pebble Beach, Calif.
The owners of the artwork, retired Harvard doctor Ralph Kennaugh and Angelo B. Amadio, reported that the stolen art included works by Matisse, Miro, Rembrandt, and Renoir. The most valuable piece was a Jackson Pollock painting estimated to be worth $20 million.The paintings were part of a collection of over 100 pieces of artwork.
According to Amadio, the stolen art was stacked in the hallway of their home. The two owners had been planning to move out because a security company had refused to install a security system, he said.
A 2002 insurance appraisal valued the collection at $27 million. But according to Amadio, a more recent assessment put the worth of the combined collection at upwards of $80 million.
Commander Mike Richards of the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office said the police have several suspects but added that he could not divulge further details while the investigation is ongoing.
Amadio said that he believes the theft to be an inside job because the thieves were able to differentiate between the authentic pieces and reproductions.
He said that only six people knew of the collection in the house.
Kennaugh told the Boston Globe that he has been collecting art for the past 30 years without having a work of art stolen. Richards also noted the unusual nature of the case. “We have not had cases of this nature in recent years,” he said.
Amadio and Kennaugh are offering a $5 million reward for the return of the artwork in its original state and for evidence leading to the arrest of the perpetrators.
According to Amadio, a ransom note was found that demanded money and also included a death threat. “If someone tries to kill you for [the artwork], you let it go,” he said.

Though Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has stressed the significance of the six FAS working groups in closing the school’s projected $110 million annual deficit, the committees have made mixed progress in their task of drafting the highly anticipated budgetary proposals aimed at closing that gap.
The committees were tasked in the spring with generating budgetary recommendations, and their progress to date runs the gamut from the social sciences working group, which has drafted two full-length proposals, to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences working group, whose members seems unclear or even unaware of their particular budgetary charge.
FAS spokesman Jeff A. Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement that the groups have no set deadline for the recommendations, though he expects that the process will continue into next semester “if necessary.” In contrast, a timeline posted on the FAS planning Web site in June designated the end of October as the deadline for working groups to draft recommendations for FAS’ top academic deans.
According to FAS Divisional Dean of Social Sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn, Smith has said that all six working groups’ recommendations are due to him by Thanksgiving.
At an open forum two weeks ago, Smith said he had seen the early recommendations of some of the working groups and that he will eventually compile a summary of the groups’ recommendations.
“The work that the working groups are undertaking right now remains critical,” he said. “I can’t see a way for us to just make administrative actions to get there...We do need your ideas. We do need your participation. We do need the recommendations that will come out of the working groups.”
In recent weeks, most members referred inquiries regarding the committees to Neal or the chairs of their groups. But even FAS Divisional Dean of Science Jeremy Bloxham, who chairs the sciences working group, declined to comment last week and said Smith had informed him that he would like the group to progress further in its work before speaking with The Crimson. FAS Divisional Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen—who chairs the humanities working group—could not be reached for comment.
“There are some processes we have to go through,” Smith said. “We’re not going to be publicly debating these sorts of things—that doesn’t make sense at all.”
SOCIAL SCIENCES MOVE AHEAD
The social sciences working group has drafted two “very temporary, transitional” proposals—concerning the division and FAS, respectively—and is now soliciting feedback from faculty, staff, and students in the division, said Kosslyn. The committee met several times over the summer and “could have been done at the end of the summer if the Faculty and students had been around” to give feedback, he said.
The committee had been primarily charged with cost-cutting to pare down the division’s budget—not including sponsored research and operations and maintenance—by roughly one-third. But the group’s goal soon changed from cutting back to balancing the budget by generating new revenue and “stretching what we have further,” according to Kosslyn.
The working group started with “divergent thinking,” in which the committee strove to generate as many ideas as possible. At its first fall meeting in early September, the committee moved into a phase of “convergent thinking,” during which it scrapped ideas deemed unfeasible. “The ground rules for the first phase was you could think of everything. Nothing is sacrosanct because you could have ideas that spin off of those,” Kosslyn said. “Now we’re beyond that.”
After gathering feedback, the working group will decide by Oct. 7 which ideas to keep, discard, refine, or replace and will submit their final recommendations to Smith by mid-October.
ALL QUIET ON THE COLLEGE FRONT
After the two College working groups gathered for a joint introductory meeting in May, several members said they did not receive any communication from top administrators until September. Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said she met with the staff heads of the College groups over the summer but did not organize any official meetings because most students were not on campus.
But Athena L.M. Lao ’12, a member of the undergraduate education working group, said in an interview two weeks ago that the administrative silence regarding the status of the committee’s work made her worry that perhaps student involvement had been discarded altogether.
“I’m just very confused about what’s going on and what point we are at in terms of deciding things,” Lao said. “I just want to hear something from them.”
Today, the undergraduate education working group—one of the two College committees—will meet for the first time as a separate entity to begin tackling the budget problem.
A member of a College working group—who requested to not be named in order to preserve relations with the University—said that a problem the committees must confront is the lack of detailed budgetary information necessary for the thoughtful drafting of recommendations.
“You will want to know how much things cost if you’re going to talk about them in any context,” said the individual, adding that the College committees have received “nothing, no number, no benchmarks.”
NOW YOU ‘SEAS’ US, NOW YOU DON’T
According to the planning Web site, a preexisting governance committee within SEAS is meant to double as that school’s working group, but some members of the “C-9” said they did not know about this new responsibility.
“Frankly, I wasn’t aware of this as a specific charge of this existing committee,” said engineering professor and C-9 member Robert D. Howe, who is listed as a SEAS working group member online.
Former interim SEAS Dean Frans A. Spaepen, who also serves on the C-9, said that budget-cut discussions “have not been part of the C-9 business so far.” But Howe said it is “conceivable” that the C-9’s intermittent budget discussions at meetings could be part of the working group’s agenda.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kelsey T. Leonard ’10 was on her way to work Tuesday when she learned, in a text message from her mother, that a devastating tsunami had just slammed into American Samoa. The neighboring island of Samoa—where Leonard had forged many close friendships while studying abroad last fall—was hit soon after.
“Immediately, I went on Facebook, checking on friends to see if they had any updates,” said Leonard.
She and an American classmate from her term abroad began furiously texting and calling their Samoan acquaintances, trying to find out “who was safe, who we’d heard from, who we hadn’t heard from.”
Although Leonard said she now knows that at least one of her Samoan friends is safe, she still has not heard from her host family, even as the death toll has mounted to 119—a number that could rise even higher as the search for bodies continues.
LENDING A HAND
Shortly after hearing the news, Leonard began trying to organize a relief effort, starting with an e-mail plea for help to several Harvard open lists. She said she hopes to get in touch with her host family to find out “what they need on the ground” before moving forward with the relief effort planning, which is “still in its baby stages.”
Still, a number of students and organizations have already approached her about getting involved in the campaign.
Prathama K. Nabi ’11, the president of the Woodbridge Society for international students, said that the society will begin collecting donations at its upcoming functions, and added that she is excited to collaborate with Leonard in staging an event specifically for the tsunami victims.
“As an international organization on campus, we rarely if ever get to reach back to the communities we come from,” Nabi said. “Events like this help us give back to [those communities].”
Besides raising money, Leonard added, the fundraiser would also increase awareness among students on campus. She said that many students had been unaware of the natural disaster until she mentioned it.
“I think that was a strange experience for me after getting all this news, having it flooded into me via texts,” she said. “It’s just the Harvard bubble.”
A FIFTH DAUGHTER
The tsunami, unleashed by an underseas earthquake with an 8.0 magnitude hit the Samoan Islands early Tuesday morning.
Communication with the Samoan Islands, Leonard said, has been difficult because phone lines and e-mail servers have been flooded by people trying to get in touch with their loved ones. Most of the information that Leonard has received was conveyed to her via text messages and Facebook, but undeveloped technology and spotty Internet have made these methods unreliable as well.
“Right now, we’re just going by word of mouth and keeping people in our prayers, [hoping] that everybody is fine,” she said.
Although Leonard is not Samoan, she said she has maintained strong ties with the people she met on the island—especially her host family, whom she refers to simply as her “family.”
“My family took me in,” she said. “I was one of their own. They have four daughters, and I became their fifth.”

Harvard admissions officials joined counterparts from nearly 30 other colleges yesterday at a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender (GLBT) friendly college fair designed to encourage dialogue with prospective applicants about GLBT issues on campuses.
Co-hosted by Campus Pride and Friends of GLBT Youth and held in the great hall of the Massachusetts State House, the fair drew high school students, guidance counselors, and parents from across the Northeast region.
The fair’s environment provided a more comfortable setting for students to ask questions about GLBT issues than they would get at a general college fair, said Harvard admissions officer James R. Pautz ’06, who was vice chair of the Harvard-Radcliffe Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgendered, and Supporters’ Alliance (BGLTSA) during his undergraduate days.
“[Harvard] is very welcoming for students of all orientations,” he said.
Conor, a high school senior from Mass. who attended the event, said queer issues are “not really something that come up in info sessions.”
GLBT Youth board member Lex Thomas requested that high school students’ last names not be printed to protect their privacy in connection with a potentially sensitive subject matter.
Shane L. Windmeyer, the executive director and founder of Campus Pride, commended the Massachusetts government for its progressive outlook. “Not too many state governments would allow this in their house,” he said.
Susan M. Harvey, a high school history teacher and Gay-Straight Alliance faculty adviser from Littleton, Mass., brought 11 Littleton High School Students to the fair. The smaller size of the event gave students an opportunity to have meaningful conversations with college representatives, she said.
Other colleges represented there included Brown, Dartmouth, Tufts, and Yale. Several GLBT activist groups also attended with the aim of encouraging incoming college students to get involved in GLBT activism.
Approximately 200 people attended the event, according to Timothy R. Kelliher, the president of Friends of GLBT Youth—a Boston-based organization that joined with Campus Pride to host the fair.
Campus Pride is a national organization “for student leaders and campus groups working to create a safer college environment for GLBT students,” according to its Web site, The group is known for its “Campus Climate Index,” a ranking that assesses the quality of life for GLBT students on college campuses.
Campus Pride plans to co-host college fairs with other groups in Los Angeles and New York later this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 40 organizations came together in Lowell Dining Hall last night for the Women’s Community Fair, an event created to offer female students an opportunity to find organizations they might have missed in their first weeks on campus.
Co-sponsored by the Harvard College Women’s Center and the Seneca—an all-female student group—the fair provided a lively atmosphere with food and raffles.
“It’s a fun, casual event where people feel comfortable discussing ideas and getting to know people interested in the same things,” said Michelle M. Parilo ’10, the president of the Seneca.
Tables represented a wide range of women’s organizations, including social clubs, service groups, and pre-professional societies, such as Harvard Undergraduate Women In Business.
The event also featured single-sex groups, such as three sororities, which are not officially recognized by Harvard. Information about the resources available for women on campus were  provided by representatives from Planned Parenthood, Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisers (DAPA), and mental health organizations.
Lei’La’ R. Bryant ’11, the Seneca’s Women’s Outreach Committee Chair. said that the fair was a “chance for women on campus to take another closer look at what organizations are going to be really welcoming and want to see more women involved.”
But though many women attended from participating organizations, Bryant said she wished the event had gotten higher attendance from those outside the student groups.
It was “sad that we didn’t get a huge turnout of people coming who were not directly involved in groups already,” she said, adding that, even so, the opportunity to interact with other groups was valuable in itself.
Noor Iqbal ’10, who is involved with the non-profit group Circle of Women, which aims to promote women’s education in the developing world, said that past fairs had allowed her group to make a connection with the student group Women in Business, which helped increase her group’s overall effectiveness.
Iqbal added that last night was “a great forum to see what else is out there to form central partnerships for collaboration.”
Attendee Susan J.G. Reed ’12 said she found the experience worthwhile for the glimpse it gave of the sheer number of women’s groups on campus. “It was pretty empowering to see that there are this many groups focusing on women,” she said.
The Women’s Center and the Seneca will bring together many of these organizations again in the spring as part of Women’s Week, an annual event featuring discussions, speakers, and workshops that bring light to women’s issues at Harvard and around the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Northeastern Huskies women’s field hockey team did not play the part of a friendly cross-town neighbor to Harvard last night, sending the Crimson home in a lopsided shutout.
Northeastern freshman Crystal Poland and the Huskies (6-4) simply overwhelmed the Harvard Women’s field hockey team in the first half, scoring early and often to capture a 6-0 win over the Crimson (3-4, 0-2 Ivy).
Poland wasted no time in attacking, netting her first goal just over a minute into the contest by streaking to the net where junior forward Meg Sweeney found her for the assist.
The two-time CAA Rookie of the Week wasn’t done though, as she followed up a rebound off the post minutes later for her second score, and added another goal and two assists before the half.
Poland was the driving force behind the Northeastern offense, giving the Crimson problems from the beginning of the game.
“She [Poland] is a very fast, skillfull forward with great hands,” sophomore forward Allie Kimmel said. “I don’t think we put enough pressure on her at the beginning, but by the end we were getting our sticks in there and throwing her off.”
The Huskies attacked with tenacity throughout the half, outshooting Harvard 14-1 and it paid off.  Carolyn Malloy capitalized off of an initial save by Crimson freshman keeper Cynthia Tassapoulos by putting a rebound into the back of the net at the 15:12 mark.
Poland then followed with an assist to Nicola Graham, who joined in the scoring parade. Goals by Poland and Malloy capped off the first-half scoring just minutes later.
“In the first half, the main issue was a lot of mental errors all over the field and they took advantage of it,” junior forward Chloe Keating said.
“Once we stepped up our defense and were accountable for our actions all over the field we were able to stop their scoring,” the forward added.
Mustering only five shots for the game, Harvard could never quite find an offensive flow to rival its opponent’s, and when they zeroed in on the net, Northeastern’s goaltender Lizzie Priest proved up to the task.
Keating, in her normal role as tipper, and sophomore Georgia McGillivray both had scoring opportunities late in the game that went just wide enough to see Priest preserve the shutout.
While the Crimson offense certainly never clicked, the second half defense tightened up to stifle the Husky assault. Despite the first-half onslaught, Tassapoulos recorded 11 saves and held Northeastern scoreless for the second half, while McGillivray earned a defensive save.
“[In the second half] we concentrated more on the little things. Our backs did a good job of marking their forwards,” Kimmel explained. “Georgia [McGillivray] did a great job on one of their best players [Poland] and really slow[ed] her down. We turned up the pressure and Cynthia [Tassapoulos] made some great saves.”
It was just too little, too late for Harvard, which suffered its fourth consecutive loss and looks forward to taking a positive step against Ivy League rival Brown at home on Saturday.
Kimmel and the team say they feel that this weekend’s matchup against Brown will be an important statement to themselves and their upcoming opponents.
“We are feeling like we can play a lot better,” she said. “Today was a turning point. We have decided there’s no way we can keep playing like this and it’s exciting to have a big Ivy League matchup this weekend after a couple of disappointing games.”

Giving up on a dream is never an easy thing to do. Just ask Andrew Berry ’09, Harvard’s three-time All-Ivy cornerback and 2008 preseason All-American.
A star on and off the field, Berry also ranked among his graduating class’ top five percent in GPA and was Director of the Cambridge Youth Enrichment Program during his time at Harvard.
Though he dreamed of playing professional football, Berry was not selected by a pro team in the highly-competitive NFL draft last April. He received a tryout offer from the Washington Redskins, but almost immediately after he arrived at their minicamp, he was sent home with a herniated disk in his back.
Berry knew then that his dream of playing pro ball was over.
The previous summer, he had worked in trading at Goldman Sachs, where he could have continued to excel once he decided to end his playing career.
One day, however, he received a call from the Indianapolis Colts, who had heard about his time at Harvard, his injury, and wanted to interview him for a job in their player personnel department.
Berry was faced with a tough decision—take the potentially more lucrative Wall Street offer, or work in football, his passion, even if it wasn’t as a player.
“It was a difficult decision, from the aspect that I’d spent my time in the summer at Goldman Sachs and the career opportunities and support I had received there I thought were really nice,” Berry says. “But at the end of the day, I felt compelled to take the job with the Colts because that’s where my passion [was]. From that point, once I saw everything fall into place, it was pretty easy to pull the trigger.”
Berry says that the biggest influences on his decision were the people he’d interviewed with in Indianapolis, because listening to them talk about working in the organization had a strong impact on him.
He also received support from his parents, who told him to follow his heart and do what he felt compelled to do.
For someone with a goal of becoming a director of player personnel or even a general manager one day, Berry felt as if he couldn’t turn down the opportunity to enter the industry at such a young age.
“Andrew’s really special,” says Crimson football coach Tim Murphy. “For my two cents, he’ll be running an NFL team in 15 years. At 37 years old, he’ll be running an NFL franchise. I have no question.”
Like Berry, James Williams also dreams of playing professional football. Harvard’s star left tackle is also an All-American and All-Ivy standout whom his coach recently called the Crimson’s best lineman since NFL Pro-Bowler Matt Birk.
Williams was recently faced with a dilemma similar to Berry’s: apply to law school, or continue focusing on football in an attempt to get drafted and make it in the NFL. And like Berry, Williams made the decision to follow his heart, and keep doing what he loves.
“It wasn’t that hard of a decision to make,” the senior says. “Football’s been a passion of mine for a long time. I’ve been playing since I was in third grade, and I want to play for as long as I can.”
Berry, judging from experience, says he thinks Williams is making the right choice.
“Follow your heart,” Berry says. “Just because people say ‘You’re a Harvard grad, you should be doing this, you should be doing that,’ you’ve got to follow what your passion is, got to follow what you love. At the end of the day, it’s James’ life; if he wants to go play football, go play football.”
Both players agree that law school will always be there if things don’t work out for Williams, but if they do, the result could be lucrative. While first-year attorneys earn an average of $125,000, an NFL fifth-round draft pick’s first-year salary averages $500,000.
Though Berry’s Harvard degree certainly helped him get a job on Wall Street, the former gridiron standout knows that playing in the Ivy League made it tougher to make it in the NFL.
“Undoubtedly, it’s a little more difficult to make it as an athlete, just because you’re not playing at the pinnacle of competition,” Berry says. “You’re not playing LSU or Tennessee on a weekly basis.”
But Williams knows that other options will be there, like they were for his teammate, if things don’t work out on the field.
“I can always go back to law school, but this opportunity will not present itself again,” says Williams, who will take the LSATs after the season ends. “This is my opportunity if I want to play in the NFL.”
Football captain Carl Ehrlich adds that his two teammates’ decisions might have been easier than some have imagined.
“I think what’s most interesting about both of them...they don’t really consider what they are doing as giving something up,” Ehrlich writes in an e-mail. “They both have a long relationship with football and a deep respect for the game that has attracted them to this field.”
While whether Williams’ risk will pay off is still up in the air, Berry says he has no regrets.
“Confucius said, ‘If you choose a job you love, you’ll never work a day in your life,’” he says. “I really feel that’s the case here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is the first part in a series of columns analyzing the current climate of college soccer—its role in the development of the sport in America, its drawbacks and limitations, and the future of the game amidst a growing trend towards youth professional development.
Part 1: Where does college soccer fit in the landscape of American player development?
You don’t need me to tell you that soccer is a growing sport in the United States. Its rosy future has been prognosticated ad infinitum for years by sports journalists. You could argue that the sport reached its apex this past summer with the stunning performance of the U.S. Men’s National Team in the FIFA Confederations Cup. Nearly four million viewers tuned in to watch the English-language broadcast of the USA-Brazil final, with countless more watching on Spanish-language TV network Univision.
Behind the scenes however, a debate has emerged over the future of youth development in soccer. Look no further than our own senior and youth national teams to see this debate play out.
While Clint Dempsey—the USA’s top goal scorer in the aforementioned tournament—honed his skills in the collegiate game, it was 19-year old Jozy Altidore who turned heads with his performances against Spain and Brazil. Altidore, who eschewed the collegiate system entirely by turning pro at 17, is hailed as an example by many detractors of college soccer that the United States needs to mirror the development set-ups in Europe and South America to compete consistently.
Ten years ago, 72 percent of the US Under-20 (U20) roster for the FIFA Youth World Cup concurrently played ball in college. In 2007 the U.S. U20 roster—featuring senior Harvard striker Andre Akpan—only had five players in college; the rest of the team consisted of professionals. The 2009 Youth World Cup is currently underway, and only 33 percent of the US roster is affiliated with a college squad. What’s caused this rapid shift away from college soccer as the primary feeder to our national teams?
The answer is two-fold. First, the structure of college soccer itself has hampered the development of its players. With its arcane rules and limited play time (colleges typically play 20-25 games through the fall and winter, whereas similarly-aged players in Europe and South America play 10-month, full-length seasons), the average American soccer player isn’t receiving the same level of soccer that his counterparts across the world are.
Secondly, the increased competitiveness and viability of Major League Soccer have placed a greater emphasis on American professional clubs to scout the best possible talent. Recently, that has meant signing foreign youth players from overlooked areas like Africa and developing sophisticated youth development academies.
This development has had a profound impact on the importance of college soccer in the realm of American professional soccer. For years MLS teams added depth by scouring through the college ranks—even the Ivy League has received attention, with several players like Michael Fucito ’08-’09 and Penn alums Danny Cepero and Alex Grendi recently drafted. With the league recently reducing its roster sizes by eliminating its reserve league, college soccer alums have found it increasingly difficult to win roster spots amongst the growing number of young foreign players. (Interestingly enough, the only rookie on the Columbus Crew, the defending league champions, is Ivy product Grendi).
As Harvard students, we’re fortunate enough to have a nationally-ranked squad boasting players with legitimate shots of turning professional. And as college sports fans more generally, we often find reasons to cheer for athletes in other sports like basketball and football specifically because of their previous collegiate attachments (i.e. cheering for North Carolina alums in the NBA and conversely hating any Duke grads).
While some of the top contenders for Rookie of the Year in the MLS include recent college graduates like Chris Pontius and Sam Cronin, the pool of such players is thinning considerably.
One could argue of course, that the NCAA isn’t in the business of producing professional athletes. Indeed, its stated mission is to promote the safety and academic progress of its student-athletes. However, the lines of pre-professional development have been blurred in its relationship with the NFL and NBA (and by extension, the millions of dollars in profits earned through the sweat of college football and basketball players).
I’m not here to argue that the NCAA should be the primary training ground for our future American soccer stars. In fact, the continued development of MLS academies will do more for the sport than college soccer ever could. I am concerned however, that the diminishing competitiveness of collegiate soccer will take away a valuable resource for young soccer players to hone their skills.
Right now, college soccer provides a platform for players who may have been overlooked to showcase their talents. At the very least, it provides a college degree at the end of four years, an often underappreciated aspect of American sport when compared to European professional academies that quickly burn out young adults, leaving them with no career prospects if unable to “make the cut.”
Other external factors aim to significantly reduce the influence of collegiate play in American soccer. In the wake of the US’s international competitiveness, professional management companies such as Traffic Sports have begun to taken a keen interest in American youth. Tony Taylor, a member of the current US U20 roster competing in Egypt, cut his ties with Jacksonville University’s soccer squad to turn pro by signing with Traffic. The advent of third-party companies filling in the void of professional opportunities for American youth  may help accelerate the decline of college soccer.
When you’re watching the NCAA basketball tournament, you know you’re watching the best young American basketball players. Similarly, a quick glimpse of your TV on Saturdays will reveal the best young athletes in football. To watch the best young American talent, you may need to turn your eyes to a Hull City (Altidore’s professional team) or an MLS match.
Is that necessarily a bad thing? For the possibility of the USA one day winning a World Cup, absolutely not. For fans of the collegiate game, the communities that support the teams, and the parents who hope their kids can obtain scholarships, the debate is just beginning.

Year after year, the admissions office waxes poetic about the virtues of a "well-rounded class"—a class whose members have every expertise imaginable, from the International Math Olympian to the internationally ranked pole vaulter. And for the most part, they must have succeeded: everyone has a friend of a friend with an obscure talent honed to perfection.
Not so, says Mariah Carey. "Up Out My Face," released from her upcoming album, takes a swipe at the Lego skillz of this year's senior class:
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn’t put us back together again.

Flyby would be flabbergasted if no one in the class of 2010 spent a childhood building edifices to humanity from these interlocking bricks. And the seniors may not take those lyrics sitting down, if Class Marshal Shiv M. Gaglani '10 is to be believed:
And if not, Mariah, look no further than that tech school downriver.

Green initiatives. They're tricky things: entirely noble and admirable in concept, but complete nuisances when brought from abstraction to reality. For example, when the Winthrop House REP tells you that she has some "exciting green news," you know you've got to brace yourself. Because now you're only going to have one napkin dispenser on each table in Winthrop.
Cue: gasp!s and angry retaliation:
Who knew napkins could inflame such passion? And it doesn't stop there:
Evocative! Find out what happened after everyone reading the Winthrop list lost their appetite, after the jump:
The napkin project, which has been endorsed by the Office of Sustainability, will supposedly save Winthrop the hundreds of dollars spent each month filling 2-3 dispensers at each table. According to the Winthrop REP, the initiative will be implemented in all the dining halls in the future, but Winthrop is taking the lead.
The initiative has spurred a heated debate over the Winthrop list. Some argue that one dispenser will create an assembly line effect and thereby infect every napkin with 5 different pairs of hands. Yet others question that any napkins will be saved at all—what if people stockpile and then commence their meal?
In any case, perhaps we should all just take this wise fellow's word and call a ceasefire: "at the end of the day...who cares..just sit by the napkin dispenser."

Musical chairs: not a game for the weak-hearted.
If you happened to be walking through the Yard around 1:00 p.m. today, you probably saw this bizarre (and unexpectedly awesome) scene: an eclectic group of  students, hipsters, and full-grown adults, dozens-strong, wrestling over President Faust's beloved chairs to the beat of Ray Charles and the Commodores.
In other words, your favorite childhood activity: running in circles—only with gratuitous dancing, blaring music, and running in no particular direction.
Whose idea was this? What inspired this goofiness? Learn more and see pictures after the jump.
UPDATE (10 p.m.): Now with video.
 
Here's the vision as described by flash mob/musical chairs organizer and American Repertory Theater staff member Allegra Libonati in planning e-mails:
Sums it up pretty well. Libonati said that organizers started with 59 chairs and pulled out up to 10 chairs after each song.
Tunes on the playlist included:
Hit the Road Jack — Ray Charles
Brick House — The Commodores
Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps — Mari Wilson
James Bond Theme — Moby
I Got You (I Feel Good) — James Brown
Lollipop — Mika
Come On Eileen — Dexys Midnight Runners
Lexis B. Ross '13, who helped organize the mischief, said that the event had been inspired by flash mobs and Improv Everywhere. She said her "group of instigators" looked to "create moments of joy through Harvard and Boston...and make awesome shit happen."
Ross said she wasn't sure when the next instigator mission would take place or what it would entail. But more is definitely to come, she said. FlyBy'll keep you posted.

Cornell students are getting high on Adderall, Red Bull, and caffeine cocktails just to get through the night. “At this point, it’s practically like cocaine,” one student said of Adderall, adding that he's seen students “crush up Adderall and snort it."  Yes, they study at Cornell.  Hardcore, apparently.
More students are raping each other at Penn and Yale. We wonder why?

Now that former Yale Provost Andrew Hamilton has started work as Oxford's vice-chancellor (i.e. president) today, every former Yale provost in the last two decades (there are eight of them) has now claimed a prominent college presidency. Harvard Provost Steve Hyman has also been considered for top posts at several colleges, including Harvard and MIT, but so far has been turned down—for now.
More Ivy League news after the jump.
A controversial Danish cartoonist spoke at Princeton yesterday, revealing that four years after he'd printed a controversial cartoon of the prophet Muhammad with a bomb as a turban, the police still have to escort him to work.
The Cornell Daily Sun prints a biweekly sex column called "Come Inside." FlyBy shudders.
Yale's career services office knows the ins and outs of finding students finance jobs, but can barely help students land jobs in the arts. Sound familiar?
Yale is now scouring for an additional 5 percent in budget cuts from departments, since administrators had planned for an economic rebound that never came, and humanities and foreign language departments are suffering. “The only area where we can reduce costs is the one area where undergrads need us the most, language instruction,” Benjamin Foster, acting chair of Yale's Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations department, told the Yale Daily News. “But it’s chickenfeed compared to the rest of Yale’s budget.”
