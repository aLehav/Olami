After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes, you can take one look at a book and know it’s going to be good. “Interior Chinatown” is that kind of book. A purposefully distressed red cover is simultaneously reminiscent of a red packet, a newspaper cover, and a playbill.At the center is a small Chinatown gate; the interior area of the gate frames are filled by what resembles a prison or a birdcage.
There is something oddly magnetic about seeing a familiar Chinatown gate, estranged by its uncanny merging with another familiar symbol — the prison. Just like its exterior, this book is beautiful and jarring at once. Charles Yu’s “Interior Chinatown” is not only beautifully moving but also mounts a shockingly explicit political criticism of U.S. race relations. Imprisoned in perpetual poverty and tired racial tropes by systemic causes and by himself (hence the Chinatown-gates-turned-prison on the cover), protagonist Willis Wu is desperate to finally be just that — a protagonist. He is tired of being Dead Asian Man or Generic Asian Man. And the only quasi-protagonist that an Asian man can ever be is Kung Fu Guy.
With his unsettling, deadpan humor and heartbreaking honesty, Willis weaves in and out of multiple roles throughout the novel — he is Generic Asian Man Number Three, Special Guest Star, Kung Fu Guy, and even Kung Fu Dad. The scripts from which Willis reads for stage performances bleeds into the script of his life: The roles he plays and scripts he reads from are a continuation and refraction of the roles he takes on stage. Interactions and dialogue in Willis’s life become figured as script dialogue on the page; interactions on stage become impossibly interwoven with personal agency. Willis is living a script, both on and off stage — and it is the same script.
I write as if there are two clearly delineated storylines and scripts, one on and one off stage, but the brilliance of Yu’s text lies in the remarkable integration of the two. Stage and life bleed into one another so seamlessly that they are indistinguishable — stage, in fact, is life. Yu’s novel is a commentary on racial performativity and self-orientalization, on the way we — all of us, Asian American, black, or white — trap ourselves in overdone racial roles.
This imprisonment is enabled by exterior, institutional causes, but Yu’s startling observation is that it is also an interior act. Willis may not have a choice about what roles others see him in, but every action that lands him a role — a line in the script that reduces him to a caricature of Asian-ness — is a choice. Unmistakably, Yu tells us that though our broken system might be guilty of imprisoning us in particular racial roles and cycles of poverty, as well as physically detaining us in internment camps and prisons, that we, too, are also guilty — of self-imprisonment in interior Chinatowns. Of performing our race in palatable roles because of the proximate satisfaction it may give us. We all want to be Kung Fu Guy. It pays well and gives you the exhilarating satisfaction of being noticed, of being seen, even if what is being seen is a distorted version of you.
Yu also explores one of the touchiest subjects in Asian American politics: Why Asian Americans often do not feel “fully justified in claiming solidarity with other historically and currently oppressed groups,” and the relative position of Asian America in relation to the spectrum of racial oppression-to-privilege, which is, in the master narrative of American politics, organized along a single axis of black and white. The script that Willis wants so desperately to have a line in as Kung Fu Guy is, hilariously and meaningfully, the show “Black and White.”
What Willis is told by his defense lawyer when standing on trial for his own disappearance are words that every Asian American activist needs to hear. That Willis’s relegation to peripheral roles in all scripts, including the one of black and white, is in part due to this: “That because on the one hand you, for obvious reasons, have not been and can never be fully assimilated into mainstream, i.e., White America ... That while your community’s experience in the United States has included racism on the personal and the institutional levels…That the wrongs committed against your ancestors are incommensurate in magnitude with those committed against Black people in America.”
These feelings — of suffering a “second-class oppression” — have caused Asian America to cause our own disappearance from the American political landscape. But Yu makes it clear that this message is not an argument that Asian America’s deafening political silence and activist deference to the supposed master racial narrative of black/white antagonism is solely because of external, systemic pressures. As Willis realizes, “[We are] guilty .... Guilty of playing this role. Letting it define me.…By putting ourselves below everyone, we’re building in a self-defense mechanism. Protecting against real engagement.”
Yu’s text is an overwhelming work of brilliance — not only are the cleverness of his textual construction and chosen metaphors stunning, but the deeper message behind Willis’s narrative cuts to the core of not just what it means to be Asian in America, but what is means to be Not White in America. Everyone who seeks to have engaged, critical conversations about race in the U.S. should aim to read “Interior Chinatown, ”whether they are Asian American or not. Yu’s message on our self-imprisonment in particular racial roles is a radical, important one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bong Joon Ho, an acclaimed South Korean film director and screenwriter, has become a top-tier visionary auteur with a passionate cult following. The term “bongtail,” a combination of his name and ‘detail,’ has been globally embraced by cinephiles to describe his frame-by-frame attentiveness — the product of Bong’s meticulous, webtoon-like storyboards. An American commentator at the Cannes Film Festival wrote, “Bong Joon Ho has become a genre unto himself.”
Bong has inspired audiences to start watching and enjoying foreign language films through the universal language of cinema. “Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,” he said at the 77th Golden Globe Awards.
To celebrate the 100th year of Korean cinema, below is a list of the top five greatest Bong Joon Ho films of the past decade. Bong’s features combine hints of black comedy, uncanny genre-meshing, and wry social critiques of the current times in a way that dazzles audiences and revitalizes the promise of movies. All of the following films were written and directed by Bong.
0. “Parasite” (“Gisaengchung”) (2019)
This thrilling, hilarious, yet deeply unsettling film deserves a greater-than-top spot on this list.
Since its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, “Parasite” has won a number of accolades, breaking records as the first ever South Korean film to win the coveted Palme d’Or by unanimous vote. It burst the Tomatometer on RottenTomatoes, won at the Golden Globes and Screen Actor’s Guild Awards, and is now entering the 92nd Academy Awards with multiple nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. Not only has “Parasite” received widespread international acclaim, but this film has become a defining cultural icon of our era.
It is a wily story about infiltration: A poor family scams its way into the lives of a rich family. It tells of class struggle and economic inequality, with a subtle touch of humor and irony. Beyond this angle, the film conceals Bong’s ambition to tell “metaphorical” stories about the decaying human condition. Bong describes “Parasite” as “a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.” As for plot details, Bong has urged theater-goers to watch the film while knowing as little about it as possible. For that, I’ll keep you in the dark.
1. “The Host” (2006)
In Seoul’s Han River, a giant, carnivorous, mutant fish is borne out of American misconduct: A U.S. official commands a Korean lackey to pour toxic chemicals down the drain (a real-life incident that happened in Seoul in 2000, except for the mutant fish part).
One fateful day, the creature leaps outside of the waters, terrorizes the city of Seoul, and kidnaps the teenage daughter of a slow-witted young man named Park Gang-doo (played by Song Kang-Ho, who has since appeared in four of Bong’s movies and who plays the Kim family patriarch in “Parasite”). The Park family gathers to rescue Gang-gu’s daughter, and becomes riled up in a gut-churning, emotionally moving adventure involving government conspiracy, environmental pollution, and tight family bonds. Propelled by a wizardry of scary sequences and special effects, “The Host” was the first of Bong’s films to be played in mainstream movie theaters all over the world.
2. “Mother” (“Madeo”) (2010)
“Mother” is a poetic, heavy-handed masterpiece that centers on an unnamed widow, played by actress Kim Hye-Ja — known to South Korean audiences as an archetypal mother figure — whose mentally challenged adult son is implicated in the killing of a schoolgirl. The titular mother attempts to figure out the truth behind the murder, while struggling with intimate details of her and her son’s past. The film is known for its off-kilter opening sequence where Kim dances alone in a vast field of yellow grass with an empty, ominous look on her face, setting the tone for the rest of the movie.
3. “Memories of Murder” (2003)
“Memories of Murder” is a true-crime detective story based on South Korea’s notorious Hwaseong serial murders, the best-known cold cases in the country. Set in the mid 1980s when South Korea functioned under the rule of a military dictatorship, this film follows two abusive and incompetent police detectives who attempt to uncover the sexual assaults and brutal killings of multiple women. The signature feature is notable for mixing absurdly beautiful sequences of melancholia with biting political satire, launching Bong’s career as an internationally renowned auteur.
A week before “Parasite” opened in the U.S. this past October, a police official revealed that a South Korean man, a prisoner in his 50s, has confessed to ten of the unsolved Hwaseong murders, which had remained a dark stain in the nation’s collective memory. Though the killer could not be prosecuted as the 15-year statute of limitations had already expired in 2006, he is currently serving a life sentence.
4. “Snowpiercer” (2013)
Inspired by a French graphic novel, “Snowpiercer” is an action-packed dystopian train film with a stellar cast. Snowpiercer is the name of a high-speed train that zooms around the post-apocalyptically frozen globe. As the only survivors of humankind after a climate engineering experiment gone wrong, the passengers have become segregated by class, with the elite in the lush front cars while the poor are crammed into squalid tail compartments by armed guards. Chris Evans and Jamie Bell play members of the train’s lower class, and the film starts as they lead a rebellion against the train’s higher classes and advance forward.
5. “Okja” (2017)
“Okja” is a sci-fi refurbishing of the classic “Charlotte’s Web” tale — a young girl befriends a livestock piglet and fights for his life — to mirror a modern age of genetic revolution and multinational consumerism. With scenes spanning from largely naturalistic, bucolic mountaintops to hectic city centers in lower Manhattan, “Okja” delivers a scathing, overtly political statement on the repercussions that occur when humankind manipulate nature for their selfish, commercial ends.
Debuting on Netflix, this film included appearances from a gaggle of both English-language and Korean-speaking stars, including Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Steven Yeun. Playing scientific researchers, corporation executives, and animal rights activists, the cast battles over the eponymous digitally rendered super-shoat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard standout Kyle Juszczyk ‘13 is no stranger to the big stage since he entered the NFL in 2013. This Sunday, however, Juszczyk will be making his first appearance on the biggest stage in the sport: the Super Bowl.
The San Francisco 49ers fullback had appeared in the playoffs five years ago with the Baltimore Ravens, joining the team just months after a Super Bowl victory. Now a member of the most successful team he has played on in his prosperous career, Juszczyk finds himself in the Super Bowl following only his second career playoff appearance.
While 60 minutes of football separates Juszczyk from champion status, the Harvard alum is no stranger to success. His career in Cambridge was defined by impressive accomplishments. The two-time All-American and three-time All-Ivy — including a unanimous selection following his senior season — left his mark on the Harvard record books. Juszczyk currently sits as the all-time leader among tight ends in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdown receptions. When receivers are included, Juszczyk still sixth, seventh, and third in each category, respectively. Team success followed, as Harvard went 31-9 in Juszczyk’s four years as a Crimson, including an Ivy League title during an undefeated conference campaign in 2011.
This success followed into Juszczyk’s professional career. He was selected by the Ravens in the fourth round with the 130th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, the second-highest ever for a Harvard football player, behind only Isaiah Kacyvenski ‘00
Following his 2016 campaign, Juszczyk was named to his first-ever Pro Bowl, and the recognition did not stop in Orlando. His success earned him a four-year, $21 million contract with the 49ers the following offseason, setting the record for the largest contract ever signed by a fullback. Juszczyk would make the Pro Bowl for the next three consecutive seasons, playing in Orlando the week before the Super Bowl with the league’s best from 2017 to 2019. This year, however, the Pro Bowler missed the game in order to prepare for the much more important Super Bowl this weekend.
Juszczyk is not the first Harvard alum to appear in the Super Bowl. John Dockery ‘66 (Super Bowl III), Pat McInally ’75 (Super Bowl XVI), Matt Birk ’98 (Super Bowl XLVII) and Kacyvenski (Super Bowl XL). Only Dockery and Birk won the game and took home a Super Bowl ring, exclusive company Juszczyk hopes to join this Sunday in Miami.

ITHACA, N.Y. — On Saturday night, players, coaches, and fans alike packed the infamous Lynah Rink for the next installment of the storied rivalry between the No. 16 Harvard men’s hockey team and No. 1 Cornell. Yet, despite the game delivering on the drama characteristic of a Crimson-Big Red showdown, nobody left satisfied.
An eventful last five minutes, in which each team notched its only goal of the night, brought the game to overtime. But extra hockey could not provide a more conclusive result, as Harvard (9-6-5, 7-4-4 ECAC) tied Cornell (14-1-5, 9-1-3), 1-1.
“[The tie is] just frustrating. Excellent team we’re playing against,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 started. “I thought we played well. I thought we really defended well. We get the lead, we’re working hard, we’re limiting chances for them and creating some stuff for us.”
The storied rivals retook the ice for the third period having skated to a goalless stalemate through 40 minutes. In the middle frame, Harvard carried play for minutes at a time, showing the first signs of one team tilting the ice slightly in its favor. The Crimson’s 12-4 advantage in second-period shots indicated as much.
Nonetheless, the most relevant ledger of all — the scoreboard — reflected a tie, demanding that the third stanza determine a victor. And just when it appeared as though a winner had emerged, Cornell re-wrote the script.
Trailing by a score, the Big Red pulled junior goaltender Matthew Galajda with over two minutes remaining in the matchup, gaining an extra skater in his stead. A crucial offensive-zone penalty from Harvard sophomore Jack Drury enabled a 6-on-4 for the home team, and just 10 seconds into the powerplay, sophomore forward Michael Regush potted the game-tying goal in close.
“We take an offensive-zone penalty, and it ends up being the difference between a huge win for us and a tie,” coach Donato said. “As a group, we took a big step forward for us. Coming [to Lynah Rink], it allows you to have a chance to grow as a group and come together in this environment against an excellent team.”
Regush’s eighth of the season came after the Crimson failed to seal victory on several empty-net-goal opportunities.
“That’s what I talked about after the game,” coach Donato began. “I said, ‘Listen, guys, we had two full possessions with an empty net, and we took an offensive-zone penalty that put us down.’ There’s no moral victories, and we just have to keep improving.”
The tally also equalized a late-third-period Harvard goal from none other than Drury. With four minutes left on the game clock, sophomore forward Casey Dornbach strode with the puck down the right side of the Crimson’s offensive zone.
He carried it behind the net and threw it into the slot, where Drury had broken free from a defender. The centerman found twine on the ensuing one-timer, which was upheld after Cornell coach Mike Schafer petitioned the officials for a goaltender interference review.
So, after 56 hard-fought, well-played minutes by Harvard, the visitors finally had something to show for the effort. Regush’s spoiler two minutes later restored the gridlock and in doing so resurrected the Lynah crowd, which had fallen silent after Drury’s late go-ahead snipe.
After the game, Drury, who was involved in the highest and lowest points of his team’s performance, bore the burden of the 1-1 draw — disappointing only because his squad was otherwise primed to take down the nation’s top squad in a notoriously hostile barn.
“It’s disappointing,” said Drury of his late-game penalty. “At the end of the day, I can’t be doing that. It was tough. I feel awful.”
Teammates were not as hard on Drury as he was on himself.
“He’s the most angry guy in the entire room right now for that,” said junior blue-liner Reilly Walsh of Drury. “He’s been the best player on our team for just about this whole season. He’s first [penalty kill], first [powerplay], basically one of our captains this year. You can just see when he plays, he’s the hardest-working guy. And he scored the goal for us…. We wouldn’t have been in that game if it wasn’t for him.”
Considering the unfriendly crowd and formidable opponent, the Crimson’s execution of a solid gameplan was laudable. The Harvard icemen outshot the hosts to the tune of 30-17, controlling possession and playing in the Big Red’s zone for notable stretches on Saturday. These are not easy feats considering Cornell’s size, speed, and forechecking prowess.
“The game in Boston, [Cornell] came out and put us under pressure early on their forecheck,” coach Donato recalled. “As the game wore on in Boston, after they kind of knocked us off-balance a little bit, we played pretty well the second half of the game. But against a team like this…you’re going to have a tough time climbing uphill.”
When the two rivals met in early December, the Big Red overwhelmed the Crimson in the first period with these very strengths. Harvard was determined to prevent Cornell from dominating to such a degree, and to its credit, if anything the visitors carried the play at Lynah.
“Shots probably told the story of the game,” Walsh said. “When it was 5-on-5, they didn’t stand a chance. I thought we did extremely well with their forecheck…. It’s very hard to get points out of Cornell, and we haven’t gotten any points here in my three years. This is our first time. But obviously the tie isn’t what you look for.”
Galajda (1 GA, .967 SV%) was unwavering for almost the entirety of the contest, and while the Big Red’s scoring attempts were more limited — courtesy of timely blocked shots, skilled stick checks, and savvy positioning by the Crimson — senior net-minder Cameron Gornet (1 GA, .941 SV%) made key saves when called upon to preserve the primarily scoreless affair.
Just over seven minutes into the tilt, Harvard forward Austin Wong laid an ugly check on Cornell centerman Matt Stienburg. The collision between freshmen sent Stienburg into the boards close to the Big Red bench, drew an immediate whistle from the referees, and ushered in loud jeers from the Lynah crowd.
Wong was assessed a much-deserved two-minute minor penalty on the play, but considering the nature of the hit and the subsequent officials’ review, the Crimson was lucky to avoid a five-minute major and retain Wong’s services for the remainder of the bout.
The boarding infraction remained the sole critical juncture of the first period. The back-and-forth frame produced just 10 shots between the two foes, split evenly at five apiece, and set the tone for the period to follow as well.
“I think the first period [was successful] before their penalties that kind of cut our momentum down,” Walsh said. “The shots were 5-5, and they had two powerplays…. In the second period, we just tried to stick to our gameplan, same thing we were going with in the first.”
As with any Harvard-Cornell matchup at Lynah Rink, the visitors were forced to endure an aerial barrage of seafood as they skated onto the ice before the national anthem. Each year, the Big Red student section rains hundreds of fish down on the ice before the opening puck drop, and this clash in Ithaca was certainly no exception.
After a two-point weekend that will keep the Crimson dissatisfied, coach Donato’s group now turns to a busy stretch in the schedule, featuring several road trips in between rounds of the Beanpot Tournament. Harvard will look to use this result at Lynah, which easily could have ended in two points for the visitors, as a motivator and stepping stone along the path to the campaign’s home stretch.
“It’s a very, very big step confidence-wise for our group,” Walsh said. “It’s no fluke what that score was. We’ll be in the top 10 soon enough.”
