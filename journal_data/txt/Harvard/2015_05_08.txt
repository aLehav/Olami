After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a Tumblr blog at iminafinalclub.com posted the purported names of members of the male final clubs. Several days ago, another similar blog, iminafinalclubtoo.com posted a list claiming to include the names of the female final club members. These revelations and the subsequent backlash from the students listed come in the midst of a campus-wide conversation about inclusivity at Harvard, a discussion that, as we have said in the past, has in part been helped by providing some degree of anonymity to the participants. Unfortunately, these blogs do not help create a productive discussion moving forward. Even as the reaction to them raises significant questions about the nature of final clubs, we need to have a more sincere dialogue than these websites can possibly create.
Part of the issue lies with the sensitivity of the situation. Though not ideal that Harvard students feel unable to comment on the record about exclusive social organizations, it is understandable. Members of final clubs recognize that there can be a stigma attached to self-identifying as belonging to such an organization. It is hard to imagine what sort of productive dialogue will emerge from publicly exposing the membership rolls. Crimson staff writers contacted dozens of individuals listed on the Tumblrs for comment; not one responded. The stated purpose of the site, to enable Harvard students to “discourse with [final club members] about inclusivity issues on this campus,” is written to be sarcastic and snarky.
In reality, these blogs represent little more than pettiness—yet at the same time, the reaction to their contents has been revealing. Final club members have viewed this as an unconscionable breach of privacy, a threat to future career prospects, and an affront to their organizations. The strong desire for individuals not to be associated with an organization they voluntarily joined, and indeed often at quite some effort, raises questions about why they chose to join in the first place.
If students are concerned they will be associated with organizations often viewed as sexist, elitist, discriminatory, or exclusionary, why did they associate themselves with them?  Their argument worryingly seems to boil down to, “we don’t want anyone to find out we’re doing something we know to be objectionable.”  Of course, many likely also think that the final clubs of which they are a part do not deserve the bad reputation that they have. If this is the case, their objection is more reasonable, but it still begs the question of why, if so concerned with the potential impact to their reputation, they joined at all. Doesn’t choosing to affiliate oneself with an organization represent a choice to bear the consequences of doing so?
Ultimately, a more honest dialogue from both sides is needed. The serious issues of diversity and inclusion that the presence of final clubs presents deserves a more serious effort from the clubs and their members than we have seen thus far. Those who oppose final clubs, as we do, must remember to keep the discourse civil, productive, constructive, and engaging. That is the path forward for a more inclusive campus, not anonymous Tumblrs or secret lists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, I posted a Facebook status in solidarity with the protestors in Baltimore, won an award at The Harvard Foundation for furthering intercultural and race relations on campus, and wrote an essay on the racial biases embedded in the criminal justice system for African and African American Studies 10.
On the surface, I am the perfect ally.
But a few days ago, while I sat in my 300 square foot room at the most prestigious university in the world—desperately hoping for likes on my Facebook status—I realized that I represent everything I oppose about our country.
As I’ve written before, I’m white, have two married and affluent parents, possess a disco stick, identify as a male, and am into women. Clearly, I come from a place of immense privilege. But my privilege alone is not what makes me a symbol of America’s deficiencies—or, at least, it’s not the aspect of my identity I’m going to focus on in this piece.
Rather, I see myself as an emblem of America’s false-promises because I’m someone who understands what’s wrong with our nation, but hasn’t come up with ways to fix it; because I take pride in organizing rallies, writing impassioned columns, and objecting to offensive remarks, but I never sacrifice my own well-being and comfort in order to further the causes I believe in.
Here’s a case study: as soon as I heard that a grand jury let off the police officers responsible for Eric Garner’s death, I posted a Facebook status calling on members of my community to burst their bubbles of privilege and take action. One month earlier, I’d written something in reaction to Michael Brown’s death, and a couple years beforehand, I wrote about Trayvon Martin. But I never did anything.
Observing this trend, my friend Jonas responded to my Garner status with a blunt comment: “Walk the walk,” he wrote. “If you don't do something to [burst your bubble] within the next 24 hours, I’m revoking my like.”
Jonas lit a fuse in me, and I immediately started organizing—not just because I was afraid he might unlike my status, but because he had gotten it right: I had never walked the walk. Over the following few days, I started a Facebook group, helped form a couple of rallies, gave a speech on privilege, participated in die-in after die-in, and convinced myself that fighting racial inequality in America would become the issue that defined my time at Harvard.
But then, winter break happened, tensions boiled down, and I got back to my normal routine at college just as easily as I had left it. I engaged with racial issues, but they no longer consumed me; I talked about what was wrong, but I stopped actively advocating for change.
Which takes me back to the scene in my dorm room.
Thousands have taken to the streets in Baltimore. Facebook has once again become dominated by a deeply destructive (and, at times, profoundly meaningful) conversation on race. And I’m sitting there, having just found out that I was selected to receive an award, with a miserable pit in my stomach. Because, once again, I am reminded of Jonas’ words, “walk the walk,” and I realize that I am about to accept an award for, essentially, latching onto a movement when it already had momentum.
I was hardly better than the media in Ferguson and now Baltimore: I decided to help lead a movement once the country was already paying attention, made some noise, and then left. I do not deserve recognition for this.
Beyond simply advocating for better trained police officers and more ubiquitous body cameras when policemen tragically murder African Americans, we need to radically alter the framework of American society in order to even begin to equalize the playing field. We need to fight widespread economic disenfranchisement, mass incarceration, and crippling housing policies. We need to reduce the benefits of attending an institution like Harvard by making quality education accessible to all Americans.
But sadly, even a piece like this—one I wanted to come across as a condemnation of talking and a plea for action—is nothing more than empty rhetoric. Because writing any column aimed at the echo-chamber that is the Harvard community is an inherently limited exercise—one that fails to connect me with the people whose voices need to be heard.
So, view this column as an apology and a call for all Harvard students to start proactively coming up with ways to create concrete, legislative change and sustain a prolonged dialogue. When the media leaves Baltimore, we need to be there in spirit, fighting for change, even as we make sure never to forget that we’re miles away and worlds apart from their struggle.

Apples are important. They are lodged in our throats and imprinted on our cell phones. They proxy in for the unspecified fruit Eve gave Adam, and pies made out of them are quintessentially American. My graduating class planted 14 trees of them at our high school, and 30 years from now, we hope to return with spouses and children, hungry for the fruits of our labor. And as I eat this apple, alternating bites with lines of prose, I savor all this historical, cultural, and personal significance even more than its sweet flavor.
Nothing would please me more than writing an article chronicling mankind’s fixation with the apple. That says a lot about me. Fortunately for you though, the apple is even more important as a commodity than an artifact, so this is the story of how one fruit might just determine the future of American agriculture.
Earlier this week, the United States Department of Agriculture announced that it’s lifting its import restrictions on fresh apples from China. That means starting this month, China—the world’s largest producer of apples—can freely enter American markets, selling cheap and low-quality fruit in direct competition with our nation’s harvest. American officials are hoping this decision would persuade the Chinese—who only currently import red and golden delicious apples from a handful of states—to loosen their own trade restrictions in good faith.
As China’s consumption of American apples is definitely nontrivial, this expectation of requital makes sense. Interestingly, according to President of the Washington Apple Commission Todd Fryhover, Chinese consumers are especially hungry for more Red Delicious apples because their rich, crimson hue represents good fortune in their culture. But flooding American markets with Chinese apples in hope of the reverse is ultimately unfruitful triage for the more pressing problem, one that is closer to home: we just had the largest apple crop in American history and need foreign buyers to compensate for lackluster domestic demand.
Wagering the already problematic American apple industry on faith that China will reciprocate is incredibly short-sighted, especially because we’ve been unsuccessfully trying to get the nation to relent on its import restrictions for a couple years now. Even if they do, it won’t amount to much.
If you’ve been following the Chinese’s apple purchasing closely for the past couple years (like, who hasn’t?), you would notice that China doesn’t really need American apples.
China purchased its largest shipment of Australian apples just this week, and will start importing from South Africa, where farm labor and manufacturing is much cheaper that in the states, in May. Domestically, China produces nine times as many apples as the US does with lower costs of production, and accordingly exports more apples than it imports by a margin larger than America’s entire apple supply. This is all to say the USDA is either lying or kidding itself when it says that it expects China to contribute no more than 0.4% of apples consumed in America.
There are reasons why we haven’t welcomed Chinese apples in the past. China’s atrocious food safety regulations and pollution problems pose a serious threat to American consumers. And the USDA initially barred Chinese apples because they carry invasive pests like the Oriental fruit fly that could destroy entire crops of American apples. These dangers, unlike the government’s attitude towards them, haven’t changed.
We’re on the verge of an apple crisis with some pretty precarious implications on the health of American consumers and livelihoods of American farmers. And as President Obama attempts to fast track the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the coattails of the purportedly infallible “free” trade model, these same issues with the trade balance and safety will emerge in other sectors of the agriculture economy as well. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement just a couple decades ago, the abrupt influx of cheap foreign food reversed our once impressive agriculture trade surplus and brought hundreds of thousands of farmers to bankruptcy. It looks like we haven’t learned from our mistake.
The integrity of the American economy does not boil down to apple trade. But at its core, the apple is important. It demystified gravity. It has kept doctor after doctor away. It almost killed Snow White, for Christ’s sake. And in a matter of months, it will be shipped by the ton from China to a supermarket near you, leaving an important American industry to rot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-eight undergraduates received Hoopes prizes for outstanding academic work or scholarly research this week, many for their senior theses.
Funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, the annual grant seeks to award students for “promoting, improving, and enhancing the quality of education...in literary, artistic, musical, scientific, historical, or other academic subject,” according to the Hoopes prize website. FAS faculty supervise the undergraduate projects.
The prize includes a $4,000 award for undergraduates and a $1,500 honorarium for faculty advisers. In addition, this year’s winning submissions can be viewed in Lamont Library for the next two years.
Abla Alaoui Soce ’15, who won a Hoopes prize for her thesis in Psychology entitled “Animate Shape Features Influence High-level Animate Categorization,” said the award represents both her dedication to her work in the field of visual cognition and the support she received from her adviser.
“I was really lucky,” Soce said. “I was very supported. I want to continue on in this research. I don’t think this the end of this topic for me.”
Daniel Barcia ’15 echoed Soce, saying that the completion of his History thesis does not represent the end of his exploration of his thesis topic.
Barcia, whose thesis is entitled “Restless Liberty: The Fall of Florida’s Maroon Haven and the Largest Slave Rebellion in U.S. History, 1835-1838,” traveled to Spain, Florida, Washington, D.C., and New York to conduct research in various archives. A native Spanish speaker, Barcia said he found the research he did with Spanish documents some of the most rewarding work he has done at Harvard.
Barcia said he had to cut some of the body of his thesis to fulfill the History department’s page length limits. He hopes both to add back in and expand upon the edited material.
“There’s still a lot of work to be done in this area,” Barcia said.
Brad G. Bolman ’15, who was awarded for his thesis entitled “The Pigs That Therefore We Are: 20th-Century Porcine Biomedical Experimentation," also said the thesis is just the starting point for future research.
Originally, Bolman thought the goal of thesis writing was to produce “something large, coherent, and good” to contribute to academic discourse, he said. Now with plans to apply to graduate school, Bolman said he hopes eventually to continue developing his research into articles, books, or other published works.
Indeed, for many of the Hoopes Prize winners, the rigors of the research process itself motivated their work, they said.
“It’s hard to know what you might find, and that’s the beauty of research and doing good scholarly work,” Hoopes Prize awardee Forrest S. Brown ’15 said.
Brown, whose winning thesis in History is entitled “Sudden War: The Yosemite Miwok Indians and the California Gold Rush,” said he began his thesis process knowing that he would write about Yosemite but did not know what the  project ultimately would cover.
“I had a concept, I found everything I could, and I wrote about what I had, realizing what wasn’t there but what I tried to find,” Brown said. “I think this is the tricky and frustrating part of good academic research, and the one you could never rush through.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many students at Harvard, course selection is hectic enough. But for some students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, shopping for books and course packs delivers added stress.
Even at a school acknowledged to have one of the most generous financial aid programs in academia, students at Harvard still run into barriers created by costly course materials.
Jasmine A. Fernandez '16, a member of the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, said she often sees this challenge up close. “I distinctly remember one of my friends telling me that there was this education class that he really wanted to take,” Fernandez said. “It was about social disparities in the U.S. education system, and it really hit close to home.”
After realizing the course required multiple books that added up to hundreds of dollars in expenses, Fernandez said, her friend decided to look elsewhere for a less financially burdensome course.
“This class is talking about the social disparities within education, and it’s actually providing that barrier for him,” Fernandez said.
TRADE-OFFS
For more than a decade, the Financial Aid Office has conducted a survey of the price of books among the top 25 most widely subscribed fall courses. For the 2014-215 academic year, the average cost on a student for a year of books was estimated at $1,217. This data provide the starting point for expectations on the reasonable amount for students to spend on books, according to Sally C. Donahue, the College's director of financial aid.
“It’s a moving target. Students make decisions where they are going to buy their books, whether they are going to buy their books, whether they are going to read them in the library, purchase used or new,” Donahue said. “Those are a lot of variables that obviously impact how much a student needs to budget for books.”
For students who come from households with incomes of less than $65,000, their parents are not expected to contribute to the cost of attending the College. The full cost of attendance not only includes the billed expenses of tuition, fees, room, and board, but also includes unbilled expenses, comprised of an estimated cost of travel and personal expenses, such as books.
But regardless of socioeconomic background, all students on financial aid are expected to contribute to the cost of attendance through some combination of a term-time job, grants, or, for domestic students, summer savings.
Term-time jobs, however, do not entirely fill the void for some students. “Yes, I have a work-study job, that does provide some money, but that’s saved up so I can go home,” Fernandez said.
And when it comes to purchasing books, a $200 textbook presents trade-offs. “I’m not going to do that, because I can’t afford it,” Fernandez said. “There are other things I need to buy, random things, like detergent, but also my flight home.”
Additionally, according to Ana M. Barros ’16, the president of the Harvard College First Generation Student Union, many students who are eligible for work-study do not immediately have a job when they come to campus in the fall, leaving them with series of undesirable options.
“These students are forced to go without the required books, take out a loan, or try to find the books in the library and risk having them recalled at any moment,” Barros said. “The cost of books can directly affect the ability of a student to be engaged in a class, and sometimes determines what classes a student can take."
When Crystal J. Johnson ’15, who receives full financial aid through the Gates Millennium Scholarship program, first enrolled at Harvard, she thought expenses like books would be covered. Johnson did not anticipate having to contribute to help cover unbilled expenses and was directed to find a term-time job. But without funds at the beginning of the semester, she was left struggling to purchase books, and other expenses, out-of-pocket.
Responding to a situation of this kind, Donahue said she would advise students to cover costs through summer savings. “Ideally, what would happen is the student would use his or her summer savings to buy books in the fall, and then would use earnings from a term-time job to cover the rest of the personal expenses,” Donahue said.
Still, expectations of summer contribution can force students from low-income backgrounds to make difficult decisions between jobs that pay and those that do not.
“Especially if you’re not doing the finance and consulting route, you can be doing research, and even if you’re getting paid, the pay can be minimal compared to other jobs,” Johnson said. “Sometimes you are only making enough to cover expenses for that summer.”
Donahue recognized that financial aid can be difficult to navigate, but emphasized ongoing efforts to clarify the process.
“We have a series of sessions with freshman in the fall where we try to go through the relationship between the term bill and the financial aid award and how they might think about personal budgeting as they are going through here in a manner that is going to maximize their resources,” she said.
HELP FROM THE FACULTY 
Some professors have taken a proactive role in alleviating costs to students. Recognizing the financial demands her course presented, Graduate School of Education Professor Katherine K. Merseth, who teaches United States in the World 35: “Dilemmas of Equity and Excellence in American K-12 Education,” made the decision to alter her course materials.
“We used to require, or suggest, four or five books for the class, plus a course pack. And it became obvious that was really too much and too expensive,” Merseth said. “So we cut back and used essentially one text this last year, both in the fall and the spring.”
Copyright fees largely determine the pricing scheme of course packets, so Merseth looked for publicly available, free texts to replace or supplement required readings.
Associate professor of Sociology Matthew S. Desmond, who teaches Sociology 177: “Poverty in America,” addressed the issue by uploading materials for the course online.
Desmond could not be reached for comment for this story, but Melissa A. Hammer ’17, a student in Desmond’s class, said the professor "wanted to make sure this class was accessible to everybody, especially because it’s a class about poverty...He wanted to make sure all of the readings were available online so buying books or textbooks wouldn’t be a barrier to taking the class.”
Still, professors say their hands are often tied. Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics," taught by Economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, ranks as the most expensive of the top 25 most popular 2014-2015 fall semester courses tracked by the Financial Aid Office. The required textbook, written by Mankiw himself, was pegged at $358 full cost, and an average of $269 on discount.
Mankiw said the price of his textbook is largely out of his control. “Whenever I talk to my publisher, I try to encourage them to price it lower, but as you may know the author has very little control—in fact, really no control—over textbook prices," Mankiw said. "It’s all set by the publisher."
He noted that there are cheaper options for students, as well, such as buying books used, renting them, or using electronic versions.
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT
“No one has ever said to me, keep the cost of your course under $100, or under four textbooks,” Merseth said. “I’ve never received any direction about that. There may be somebody who worries about that, but I’ve not had any interaction with anyone on that.”
Indeed, none of the professors interviewed for this story could recall being told to keep the costs of their courses down.
Still, multiple offices advise certain professors on how much their assigned materials will cost. For courses in the Program of General Education, instructors are given a line-by-line summary of course pack costs, and texts that are unusually expensive are gently flagged, according to Laura E. Hess, the associate director of the Gen Ed Program.
“It’s not our job to police the faculty," Hess said. "We leave it up to the faculty to use their discretion, but they do get an estimate to the cost of a course pack before they approve it, so they have a chance then to decide is this in the realm of the reasonable.”
Although the Financial Aid Office surveys courses for price, it does not communicate with professors directly on making courses more affordable. “What we do is we reflect what the faculty asks students to purchase to take their course,” Donahue said.
Many low-income students at Harvard say professors’ understanding of the students they are teaching needs to change.
“A lot of faculty make the assumption that we are all from ‘modest means,’” Fernandez said.
And for leaders of the First Generation Student Union, making courses more affordable is just another step needed in making Harvard more accessible.
“Things like when the books are way too expensive to take a class and so you feel like maybe I can’t take this class,” Fernandez said. “Little things like that are reminders sometimes make you feel like this place isn’t meant for me, and maybe still isn’t ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Showcasing the work of more than 60 participating artists, the annual spring sale of the Ceramics Program of Harvard’s Office for the Arts opened in the program’s Allston studio on Thursday evening.
Patrons lined up outside the program’s space at 224 Western Ave. to browse handmade dishes, sculptures, and jewelry and to talk with the artists staffing the opening reception. The show will be open until May 10.
Founded in 1969 by a group of Harvard undergraduates, the Ceramics Program offers semester-long classes open to students and local residents. The program also hosts workshops for courses at the College and Graduate School of Design and events for students such as its “Clay All Night” parties.
Any of the 250 participants in courses offered by the program during the past semester have the opportunity to show their work at the spring sale. However, the program’s director of operations, Shawn L. Panepinto, said that most of the artists who do so are advanced ceramicists.
“We very rarely have Harvard students, whether they be undergraduates or graduate students, because they are usually on a beginner or intermediate level,” she said. “And they take everything home with them, so they don’t want to sell their work.”
One of the artists presenting works in the show, Newton resident Katherine Younger, has taken courses with the program since 2002 and described herself as a semi-professional ceramicist.
“I do sell my work, but I’m not really focused on sales,” she said. “I spend a lot of hours per week at the studio, but not enough to be a professional.”
Another of the artists featured in the show, Myrna Le Caill, said she appreciates the support that the Ceramics Program offers to non-professional artists.
“It’s a state-of-the-art studio and a state-of-the-art program, and the sense of community is great,” she said.
The program relocated to a newly renovated studio space in September 2013, a move that Panepinto said has transformed the annual show and sale.
“This is a much larger space, and it shows off the work to a much higher professional level,” she said. “Our numbers of people who come to the sale have increased, and our sales have increased.”
Panepinto herself worked with the architects on the design of the space, which had formerly served as a storage facility for Harvard’s recycling program. She said the new studio, with four large skylights and an open floor plan, represents an improvement on the program’s previous location in the basement level of 219 Western Ave. in Allston.
“I’ve seen people being so much more creative and so much happier here,” she said. “Production levels are way up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 8, 2015, at 6:05 p.m.
This is part II in a two-part series about diversity in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Part I ran on May 6.
Foldout seats in University Hall’s second-floor Faculty Room fill up as 4 p.m. draws nearer. All voting members of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences are invited to the body’s monthly meetings here on Tuesdays, although the seats are all rarely filled. Today, a breezy May afternoon, a low hum fills the high-ceilinged room as professors from departments across FAS chat over tea and coffee, mingling with colleagues. A bell rings. The meeting will commence.
Faculty meetings have taken place in this room since 1896, when it received its current name after extensive renovation. For more than a century, it has been a space in which members of Harvard’s flagship faculty come together and vote on legislation dealing with its policies.
Occasionally, some Faculty members comment on the portraits hanging on the sea-foam colored walls of this room. The portraits mostly depict former University presidents and FAS deans, who historically, have primarily been white men. According to S. Allen Counter, a professor of neurology and the director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, there are no portraits of racial minorities in that room.
Some Faculty members and administrators say this collection of portraits does not reflect the overall diversity of the Faculty today in 2015.
“Go into the faculty meeting room of the FAS and look at all the pictures and the busts,” says Judith D. Singer, Harvard’s senior vice provost for faculty development and diversity. “That’s the old Harvard. The new Harvard should be much more reflective of the pools of people [here].”
Indeed, over the past decade, FAS has seen a marked increase in the number of racial and ethnic minority faculty members and women within its ranks. Today, minorities represent about 19 percent of the Faculty, compared to 12 percent in the fall of 2000, according to the FAS Dean’s 2014 Annual Report. But while Harvard and FAS have institutionalized a hiring process designed to draw in more a racially and ethnically diverse faculty, some professors say that they feel there is more work to do to improve the work environment for those faculty after they enter Harvard’s gates.
DOWN THE PIPELINE
Increasing faculty diversity will improve the quality of teaching and research at Harvard, faculty members argue—prompting administrators to increase efforts to hire a diverse set of faculty members in recent years.
“I sincerely believe that there are problems I can solve differently because of my unique background” as an African-American in the physical sciences, says Astronomy professor John A. Johnson, who in 2013 became the first African-American to receive tenure from Harvard in the physical sciences.
Harvard tenured its first African-American faculty member, Martin Kilson, in 1969, and since then, FAS has slowly added more minority faculty members to its professoriate. In 1988, nearly two decades after Kilson’s appointment, FAS included 26 tenured minorities in a faculty of 383, just 7 percent.
In recent years, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith has prioritized increasing diversity in the faculty, he says. From 2011 to 2014, FAS extended 36 external offers to minority candidates and hired 25.
In particular, in an effort to increase diversity in the Faculty, departments and administrators have identified the search and hiring processes for tenure-track faculty as important intervention points.
“What has happened in the last 10 to 15 years is an increasing recognition that the search is the point of intervention,” says Singer, who has led the University-wide Office of Faculty Development and Diversity since 2008. “It’s really where things change.”
According to FAS Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser, her office and FAS’s divisional deans keep track of junior faculty candidate lists in an effort to ensure that they offer a diversity of perspectives. From time to time, these administrators ask search committees to reconsider a list if the candidates have become too homogeneous, Zipser says.
Beyond candidate lists, when considering the faculty search process, specialists often discuss the subject of implicit biases—the attitudes or stereotypes that cause people to value the achievements of those most like them and thus disadvantage minorities in the hiring process.
One of these specialists is Mahzarin R. Banaji, a Psychology professor who advises Smith on faculty diversity and development. Banaji, who studies implicit biases’ effects on decision-making, often consults with committees and departments as they conduct their searches, and she helped inform a guide that Singer’s office circulated on best search practices.
This awareness of implicit biases has played an active role in departmental hiring and governance at FAS, according to some professors. Johnson says that the leadership of Harvard’s Astronomy Department actively encourages minority faculty to voice their opinions and discuss diversity in the sciences; this atmosphere factored into his decision to leave the California Institute of Technology and come to Harvard as a junior faculty member, he said.
Indeed, Astronomy department chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb calls ensuring diversity among his faculty “a main guiding principle” in his leadership of the department. Johnson, Loeb, and other Astronomy professors are currently discussing the creation of a program within the department for African-American Ph.D. students, an institutional approach to improving the environment for minorities in the department.
Singer also points to the importance of addressing issues of diversity even before the hiring stage: How prospective faculty are drawn from graduate school pools, often called “the pipeline,” is “the first stage” to diversifying the faculty, she says.
Says associate professor of Music Sindhumathi Revuluri: “The more diverse our admissions are for grad students, eventually that means the more diverse pool of applicants for tenure track jobs.”
IN PURSUIT OF TENURE
While Harvard is making efforts to recruit minority faculty members and diversify its professoriate, minority faculty members say that they still face unique challenges in pursuit of tenure at Harvard once they arrive.
When reflecting on their time on Harvard’s tenure track, some minority faculty members say that they or their minority faculty peers feel that they must work harder to prove themselves and their scholarship. Survey statistics tell a similar story: According to the University-wide 2013 faculty climate survey, a little more than 40 percent of underrepresented minority faculty reported feeling the need to work harder to “be perceived as a legitimate scholar.”
According to Michèle Lamont, a professor of Sociology and African and African American Studies, minority faculty members on the tenure track may in some instances feel that their work is undervalued, which could affect scholastic performance.
“When you’re isolated and the only person in your group, then it’s very easy to lose your self-confidence, and it affects, of course, your performance,” she says, emphasizing the small numbers of minority faculty members across FAS.
Two books that Revuluri says are well-known among minority faculty speak to this feeling: “The Black Academic's Guide to Winning to Tenure—Without Losing Your Soul”  and “Presumed Incompetent,” which includes essays written by women of color in academia.
Additionally, according to Sociology professor Mario L. Small, minority faculty members can often work in fields that he called outside the academic “mainstream,” and for professors who work on these topics, expectations about the tenure process are often less clear, generating even more anxiety, he said. (Small emphasized that work in these fields is by no means limited to minority faculty and that the majority of minority faculty do not work in such fields.)
Faculty members being reviewed for tenure are also in part judged on their University service, largely in the form of their mentorship and committee work. This can present another challenge for minority faculty members, for whom the pressure to serve in these capacities can be even greater than for their non-minority peers. And often, faculty members say, they feel that these extra contributions—though usually welcomed, on their part—go unnoticed.
Specifically, some minority professors report that administrators and department chairs ask them to contribute more “service” or committee work in an effort to diversify individual committees. There then is an implicit pressure to serve for tenure-track faculty members who worry that declining to serve on a committee could adversely affect their chances of receiving a tenure offer.
“I also get asked to be on lots of committees, not just within the department, but in general,” Revuluri says. “When I mention that to some of my more senior colleagues, especially white male colleagues, they seem surprised, because they've never been asked to be on all those committees, and that’s a little strange.”
OFFERING ADVICE
Administrators and faculty suggest that increasing the diversity within FAS would help another constitute at Harvard—students.
Minority students, both undergraduate and graduate, disproportionately approach minority faculty members for advice, according to both faculty and administrators, presenting some faculty members with an extra commitment that they largely appreciate.
Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer on History and Literature, says that he and his colleagues in the Department of African and African American Studies are often point people for students who feel there are few faculty on campus who can relate to them. Johnson, of the Astronomy Department, says he is the only African-American professor with whom some of his students interact.
“When there is a legitimate grievance among students here, whether or not they feel alienated themselves, whenever there is a racial incident or a homophobic incident on campus, the students come to us,” says McCarthy, who is gay.
Because there are so few minority faculty members at Harvard, McCarthy says, they can become designated as “the one” adviser to students or “the one” representative on committees. The result is a higher, and often informal, advising commitment.
Increasing the number of minority faculty members at Harvard would largely alleviate this higher commitment, some faculty say. Human and Evolutionary Biology assistant professor Katherine J. Hinde says that administrators should consider lessening some professors’ teaching loads if they have a larger mentoring responsibilities.
Beyond mentorship, Revuluri says it is important for students to see that minorities are established within academia, so that they too can feel empowered to enter academic careers.
“I do think it matters a lot for students to see a wide array of possibilities, and that includes gender and race and socioeconomic status,” Revuluri says. She says she does not remember having a professor of color within her own major while she was an undergraduate, leaving her to navigate the decision to go into academia mostly without any mentorship.
“You have to figure that kind of stuff out by yourself,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late January, the tutors who serve as residential advisers in Harvard’s upperclassman Houses filed into a lecture hall on the first floor of Sever Hall for a regularly scheduled meeting. Among other agenda items, representatives from the College’s working group on diversity and inclusion solicited advice from the tutors, asking them to talk about their experiences in the Houses and identify potential areas for improvement.
When one tutor spoke up to raise concerns about the environment in one of Harvard’s Houses and its lack of tutors who identify as BGLTQ, the tone in the room quickly shifted. The tutor did not refer to the House by name, according to seven people who attended the meeting and independently corroborated the account, but he described concerns he had heard from students who said this House was perceived to be less welcoming to BGLTQ students than other Houses.
According to Jim Pautz ’06, the resident tutor in Currier House who raised the concerns, he was referring to Dunster House.
Several tutors applauded, and administrators seemed shocked. According to five people present, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana was visibly taken aback and turned to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde in response. Khurana approached Pautz and asked him to detail his concerns in an email, according to Pautz, who then followed up.
Administrators swiftly responded to the allegations. The next day, on Jan. 23, the College’s tutors and proctors received an email from Lassonde stamped with the subject line “CONFIDENTIAL.”
“Last night I heard a serious concern expressed about tutor hiring practices in one of the Harvard Houses. We take such allegations very seriously,” Lassonde wrote, according to a copy of the message obtained by The Crimson. “As we explore this issue we ask for your discretion and consideration in the interest of fairness to all concerned.”
The meeting drew administrators’ attention to concerns about BGLTQ life in Dunster that are not new. Current students in the House say that it lacks the resources needed to adequately support BGLTQ-identified students. Specifically, there are no resident tutors in Dunster this year whom students can identify as BGLTQ, further fueling a widespread perception that the House is generally less welcoming to BGLTQ students than other Houses.
This year, these issues have come to a head more publicly than in the past. Undergraduates in the House started speaking out about their concerns this year, and shortly after the tutor meeting in January, the College launched an internal investigation into the issue. Just days after initially raising his concerns, Pautz met with Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94, who went on to contact at least one of Dunster’s designated BGLTS—bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and “supporters”—specialty tutors through email to ask to discuss “the climate of support for BGLTQ events in Dunster House.”
Cooper declined to comment on the status of the inquiry and on specifics about Dunster for this story; Khurana and Lassonde declined as well, citing College policy against commenting on personnel matters.
Amid these conversations, administrators in the House are responding. Several changes will come to Dunster next fall, indicating attempts to address student concerns. After at least two years without them, the House will welcome two resident tutors who identify as BGLTQ next year, according to an emailed statement from Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter, who along with Co-Master Ann Porter declined requests to speak about the issue on the record in person. And although for the past two years the House has lacked a formalized budget specifically for BGLTQ programming, Dunster going forward will allocate a “generous budget” for each of the House’s “specialty tutor activities,” according to Roger Porter.
Students say they welcome the new tutors, but some worry that it will take more than these changes to fully address negative perceptions about the environment in Dunster. One of the House’s almost universally lauded designated BGLTS tutors, Avik Chatterjee ’02, is completing his program at the School of Public Health and has not been asked to return to Dunster next year, only intensifying some student concerns.
IN SEARCH OF ADVICE
In the spring of their freshman year, undergraduates at Harvard are randomly assigned to one of the College’s 12 residential upperclassman Houses. Their sizes and infrastructural make ups vary, but administrators herald them all as the cornerstone of the undergraduate experience and as a source of student advising and support, both academic and personal.
But for years, students have questioned whether Dunster adequately supports its residents who identify as BGLTQ. One prominent incident in 2004 made these concerns public: Emails over the Dunster open list charged that the House was “exceptionally homophobic” and that students were afraid to be openly gay there, with Joseph R. Geschlecht ’06 alleging that he had experienced harassment in the House.
In response to the 2004 incident, the Porters—who were appointed Dunster’s House masters in 2001—designated two resident BGLTS tutors, which the House had not had since 2002. But according to Geschlecht, the tutors, despite their best intentions, did little to assuage what he described as an unwelcoming environment that was exacerbated by the fact that he could not identify a resident tutor who identified as BGLTQ living in Dunster at the time.
Reflecting in February on his time in Dunster, Geschlecht, who is gay, said “there was a sense that you were closeted, but only in the House, which was a weird thing.” He later clarified in an email that he was referring to a general feeling and that he himself was not closeted in Dunster. He eventually moved off campus.
“It’s hard to be concrete about being made to feel unwelcome,” he said.
Years later, similar concerns remain. When Carl E. Rogers ’16 came to Harvard in 2012, he was pleasantly surprised to meet visible BGLTQ-identified freshman proctors—the first openly gay adults he said he had ever met. Rogers, who is gay, said he felt uncomfortable at his Texas high school where few people were openly gay. Harvard was a different environment.
When he moved into Dunster House just one year later, however, he said the atmosphere changed.
For the time he has lived in Dunster, Rogers said, he has been unable to identify any BGLTQ-identified resident tutors. Dunster has two designated BGLTS tutors, but neither identifies as BGLTQ. Although at least one non-resident tutor, a pre-med adviser, identifies as BGLTQ, Ann and Roger Porter, Chatterjee, and several other undergraduate residents confirmed that no tutors they can identify as BGLTQ currently live in the House.
Tutors who identify as BGLTQ have served in Dunster in the past, according to the Porters, who wrote in their statement that it was an “anomaly” that there are not tutors who identify as BGLTQ this year in the House.
To Rogers and other students, having a resident tutor whom students can identify as BGLTQ is necessary both for advising and for the overall environment in the House. And while the College does not require that designated BGLTQ or BGLTS tutors identify as BGLTQ, a 2011 report on BGLTQ student life at the College noted that students “suggested that there be at least one BGLTQ person on staff in each house.”
Several undergraduates in Dunster, while praising the work of the House’s designated BGLTS tutors, Chatterjee and Patricia S. “Patty” Smith ’11, said tutors who identify as BGLTQ can offer advice for students struggling with coming out or navigating the job market as an openly BGLTQ applicant that straight allies cannot. Several undergraduates interviewed said they feel that they must go outside Dunster for certain advising resources.
“If I had some sort of issue related to BGLTQ identity, it just doesn't make sense for me to come to them about it,” said Curtis L. Lahaie ’15, a Dunster resident, referring to the House’s current designated BGLTS tutors.
Dunster resident Ahmed Zaeem ’16, similarly, said he would have to look elsewhere to seek out advice. “If there were to be a concern about sexual health or a relationship with someone or something very complicated and specific to LGBT life, I don't feel like I have [an] adult tutor who’s there to offer me that guidance,” Zaeem said.
QUESTIONING RESOURCE EQUITY
Concerns over the last few years about BGLTQ advising in Dunster have gone beyond questions about the diversity of the tutor corps—the House, unlike at least some of its peers, has for at least the last two years lacked a formalized budget specific to BGLTQ programming.
When Avik Chatterjee applied for a tutor position at the College two years ago, he did not indicate that he had experience in BGLTQ advising. But when he was offered a position in Dunster House, he said, the Porters suggested that he serve as a designated BGLTS tutor. It sounded like they needed someone to fill the role, he said, and he accepted.
Two years later, students in Dunster praise Chatterjee for his role as an advocate and ally for BGLTQ students in the House, and the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life recently recognized him with an award for advocacy. But Chatterjee has concerns about the resources that have been devoted to BGLTQ advising in Dunster and the institutional support behind it.
During his first semester as a BGLTS tutor, in 2013, Chatterjee organized a smoothie study break for students in the House. After planning a budget, reserving a room, and writing emails to advertise the event, he said, he wanted to meet with the Porters to make sure they approved of the plans. When he met with them, he said, he got the impression that there was not a formalized budget for BGLTQ events in the House. He looked to find funding elsewhere through the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
Chatterjee emailed Van Bailey, the College’s director of BGLTQ student life, to request $100 in funding, according to a copy of the exchange that Chatterjee shared with The Crimson. In that email, dated Sept. 3, 2013, he wrote that the Porters had approved the event, but that “there are not funds available from the house for it.”
Bailey replied indicating that the Office typically capped yearly funding per House at $100 and suggested that Chatterjee consider partnering with neighboring Mather House for future events. In the email, Bailey also asked that Chatterjee “please make sure you are keeping note of the lack of funding in the house for your events.”
“I want to begin making a case to increase office funding for budgetary needs in the Houses,” Bailey wrote.
In an email to The Crimson this week, Bailey clarified that, since 2013, his office has moved from an allocation per House system to an “as needed” funding request process so tutors do not feel restricted by the $100 allotment.
Also since then, Chatterjee has hosted some free BGLTQ events, such as movie screenings, and minimized costs by co-hosting some events with Mather. He has paid for events that cost money mostly through funding from Bailey’s office; he and his co-BGLTS tutor received $10 this spring from Dunster for a movie study break, he said.
At least some other Houses have budgets specifically reserved for BGLTQ programming. According to Kip C. Richardson, who has served for the past two years as a BGLTQ designated tutor in Winthrop House, Winthrop provides a budget for BGLTQ programming that ranges from $300 to $400 per year. Ayan Chatterjee, a BGLTQ designated tutor in Currier House and Avik’s brother, said Currier allots him about $250 per semester for BGLTQ programming, but that he has never hit a strict cap.
Avik Chatterjee said this discrepancy is concerning. “Money is important, and if other Houses are getting four times as much as me, then there's inequity across Houses, which shouldn't be [the case] when you're talking about issues of diversity and inclusion,” he said.
Roger Porter wrote in an email that Dunster “regret[s] any miscommunication regarding the funding for our specialty tutor activities which receive some funding from university sources and some from house resources” and “has responded positively to every individual request from specialty tutors for House funding for their activities.”
A PERCEPTION PROBLEM?
Questions about the resources devoted to BGLTQ advising in Dunster have contributed to a general, and widespread, perception that the House is not adequately welcoming to BGLTQ students on campus. Student leaders in the undergraduate queer community say that Dunster has a reputation for not being actively welcoming to BGLTQ students, and that no matter that reputation’s validity, it has a negative impact on students and necessitates a response.
"If there were an award for the most LGBTQ-friendly House at Harvard, Dunster House would not be in the running,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government and a member of Harvard’s Gender and Sexuality Caucus who has advised undergraduates for more than a decade.
In an emailed statement, Ann and Roger Porter wrote that they “have consistently sought to create a culture in Dunster House where all students feel valued and respected.”
But for some students, negative perceptions about Dunster surface early in their time at Harvard. Julia R. Geiger ’16, a junior in Eliot House and co-chair of Queer Students and Allies, said she heard Dunster was not as welcoming to BGLTQ students when she was a freshman.
“It definitely made me nervous about getting put into Dunster,” Geiger said.
Last fall, tutors in Dunster distributed a survey to solicit feedback on the BGLTQ environment in the House. Although the survey garnered only 12 responses and many indicated positive attitudes toward the House, the survey results, which were obtained by The Crimson, also reveal that some students have concerns. One respondent wrote that the tutors should work to encourage the Porters to be more visible supporters of the BGLTQ community. Another respondent wrote that the tutors should work with the House masters to make the House more publicly BGLTQ friendly, suggesting that the House had a reputation for not being so.
Several undergraduates interviewed said that the Porters’ involvement in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Roger Porter’s experience advising Republican presidents contribute to the perception of the House as conservative.
Rogers characterized the environment in Dunster as one marked by conservatism, similar to his upbringing in Texas, with less perceived visibility or outspokenness around BGLTQ issues than other Houses, such as Adams or Lowell.
To Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life who lives in Adams House, how a House is perceived matters. "Perception directly informs your individual sense of belonging within a House community," Blecher-Cohen said. “The burden has to be on Houses in proactively welcoming queer students."
SPURRING ACTION
Concerns about BGLTQ advising in Dunster have lingered for several years now, and conversations among students and tutors this year have brought them to administrators’ attention, both in and outside Dunster. The January tutor meeting shed light on the issue to the College’s top administrators, and students within the House also raised their own concerns.
When he returned to Harvard this semester after studying abroad in China, Rogers said his concerns hit a boiling point. While he had discussed issues surrounding Dunster’s BGLTQ environment with Chatterjee before, he took the step to meet with Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, Dunster’s dean.
Diaz did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story, but Rogers said that Diaz encouraged him to schedule a meeting directly with the Porters to voice concerns.
Rogers ultimately spoke with the House masters in what he characterized as a friendly meeting. According to Rogers, the Porters suggested to him that they had expected a BGLTQ-identified tutor to come to Dunster and that it was out of their hands when the person did not.
The Porters would not provide any additional on the record details, beyond the statement that the current lack of BGLTQ-identified tutors in Dunster is an “anomaly,” when questioned in a follow-up email.
Rogers said his meeting with the Porters was constructive and that they acknowledged his concerns, indicating that they were actively working to hire a BGLTQ-identified tutor for the following year. They asked him to help interview applicants, Rogers said, and he accepted.
These concerns, it seems, have spurred action. Next year, two resident tutors will join Dunter who also identify as BGLTQ, according to the Porters. “We recognize that perceptions are important and having self-identified BGLTQ tutors in the House sends a powerful signal consistent with the culture of inclusion we seek to foster in Dunster,” they wrote in their statement.
Gregory Davis, an incoming resident tutor in Dunster House who is bisexual, said concerns over resources for BGLTQ students influenced his decision to come to Dunster, rather than another of the Houses from which he received an offer.
Through talking to students in the House, especially one student who interviewed Davis as part of the hiring process, Davis said he got the impression that “resources and events and activities were lacking in Dunster and that a change was needed in the future.”
“It was more so the need for...someone who was invested in LGBT students who was also an LGBT member,” Davis said. “I talked to a lot of students about this, and overwhelmingly the response was that I was needed at the House,” both as a BGLTQ-identified and an African-American tutor, he said.
Rogers said he interviewed Davis for the position, asking him about his experience with BGLTQ advising, and was pleased with his responses and immediately hoped he would be hired to join Dunster.
“The overall impression I got from the other tutors who were abreast of the reputation was that Dunster would be a difficult place to be an LGBT adviser but also that it was necessary that someone did it,” Davis said.
Along with hiring two residents tutors who identify as BGLTQ, the Porters have also responded in other ways. According to Roger Porter, Dunster going forward will allocate a “generous budget” for each of the House’s “specialty tutor activities,” suggesting that BGLTQ programming will receive funding from the House.
“Our objective remains to encourage, not discourage, these activities,” Porter wrote. “If that budget proves insufficient we will happily consider requests to supplement it based on available house resources.”
And according to Chatterjee, on April 28—a day after The Crimson contacted the Porters about this story—the House masters asked him whether students thought Dunster was an unwelcoming environment. Chatterjee said he “expressed that students, among other things, felt like they couldn’t identify, they didn’t see themselves in the tutor pool at Dunster.”
After they responded to The Crimson’s inquiries about BGLTQ advising in Dunster, the Porters also invited Dunster students to a confidential meeting about BGLTQ life in the House this past Tuesday, which they called “A Conversation about BGLTQ at Dunster with Roger and Ann” in an email. The first two paragraphs of the email inviting House affiliates to the event closely resembled the emailed statement the Porters sent to The Crimson three days earlier, with several sentences taken almost verbatim.
The Porters wrote that they wanted to “work together to address concerns and share ideas,” inviting Dunster affiliates to the conversation and allotting other time for students to speak with them individually.
Rogers said the Porters also sent him a personal email before the event to thank him for raising concerns and helping interview tutor applicants.
A HOPE FOR CHANGE
Several students interviewed for this story say that they are hopeful that Dunster administrators’ recent efforts to respond to student concerns will translate into an improved environment in the House next year. Lahaie, a senior in Dunster, said he thought that the Porters’ email inviting students to the Tuesday meeting on BGLTQ life in Dunster was “very sincere.”
“It’s clear that they actually care about this,” Lahaie said. “It seems like this is going to be changing for the better next year.”
According to Davis, one of the incoming tutors in Dunster who identifies as BGLTQ, he told students at Tuesday’s meeting that his main goals for next year include ally training and creating safe spaces in Dunster.
Zaeem said it was a positive development that the House had hired at least one resident tutor who identifies as BGLTQ. Still, he called the move “baby steps.”
In particular, students in the House are unhappy that Chatterjee, one of Dunster’s current designated BGLTS and race relations tutors, will not serve as a resident tutor in the House next year. Although he applied to stay on as a tutor next year after he completes his program at the School of Public Health this spring, he was not asked back by House administrators. Chatterjee wrote to the Porters in January indicating that he had received an offer at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program and an “instructor position” at Harvard Medical School.
In an email to The Crimson, Roger Porter wrote that Dunster had “not reappointed any of our tutors who are graduating this year. This is the norm not the exception.”
Still, this decision has prompted pushback from students, who worry they are losing an ally in the House. According to Rogers, who went to Tuesday’s meeting, roughly 20 or 30 people attended, and they spent the majority of the time discussing Chatterjee’s departure. A student presented a petition calling for Chatterjee to remain as a resident tutor, which Rogers and Laura K. Brennan ’16, who also attended the meeting, said had garnered more than 100 signatures.
The Porters explained specific details of the tutor hiring process to students, according to Rogers, but some still seemed concerned about Chatterjee’s departure.
“People went in very frustrated, and they left very frustrated. Nothing was really accomplished,” Rogers said.
Davis, for his part, said he wants to make resources available to students in the next year to contribute to improving the environment.
“My main goal is to make sure that students who found themselves to be in Dunster on Housing Day feel that it’s a great opportunity and a great place to spend the next three years, no matter what kind of perspective or experience they come from,” he said. “In my experience, things like reputation or discourse about institutions change very slowly, and so I want to put in the work to make sure that...the students that will be there next year have nothing but good things to say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 9, 2015, at 10:01 p.m.
Panelists raised concerns about the implications of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. at Harvard Law School’s annual conference on law, religion, and health on Thursday.
The June 2014 ruling exempts closely held corporations, or those with a limited number of shareholders that are usually not publicly traded, from the requirement to provide employees with free contraceptives if doing so violates their religious beliefs.
Some of the panelists—which included professors from a number of Harvard schools, a Washington Post columnist, and a former U.S. Congressman—raised objections to the Supreme Court ruling that corporations can exercise the same religious rights as individuals.
“Many across the religious spectrum assert that the pragmatic implications of giving corporations the same rights, and in this case religious protections, as persons actually serves to limit instead of enhance religious freedom,” Harvard Divinity School lecturer Diane L. Moore said.
Panelist E.J. Dionne Jr. ’73, who writes for The Washington Post, raised a moral objection to the ruling.
“One of the issues that comes up over and over here [is] who gets to exercise conscience?” Dionne said.
Law School professor Charles Fried provided context for the issue Dionne raised, pointing to a different interpretation of the protection of religious freedom under the First Amendment, which he said was not always used to challenge laws.
“It was assumed that the First Amendment had to do with beliefs and persecution of people for their beliefs,” Fried said. “[It] had nothing to do with granting exemption from what have come to be called laws of general applicability.”
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow noted that the litigants in the case had given evidence that they would leave the U.S. if they lost.
Dionne agreed that the debate is very polarizing.
“I think the word ‘balance’ is the only solution to all of the problems in this area,” Dionne said.

UPDATED: May 19, 2015, at 2:43 a.m.
This is part II in a two-part series about the geography of Harvard athletic recruiting. Part I ran on May 6.
This year, Harvard’s football and men’s basketball teams shared more than just championships in common.
Both teams won Ivy championships late in the season with rousing victories over rival Yale, sealed in the last minute by plays from two of their biggest seniors: Steve Moundou-Missi on the court and Zach Hodges on the gridiron. Both also have shared the bulk of the Athletic Department’s national media attention, which has only intensified as Hodges—a recent free agent signee with the Indianapolis Colts—and senior wing Wesley Saunders prepare to pursue their sports at the professional level.
The growth in attention is largely a byproduct of the work that the teams’ coaches—football’s Tim Murphy and men’s basketball’s Tommy Amaker—have done rebuilding their respective programs into national powers. According to data taken directly from rosters listed on the Harvard Athletics Department website dating back to the 1970-1971 season, the two teams currently recruit nationally in a way they haven’t in nearly half a century.
{shortcode-7af376f6d0ea7fe276839cf3f371454d34996b62}
Amaker has already recruited more athletes from Texas in seven years than his predecessors did in nearly 40, and while Massachusetts natives comprised just over a quarter of the football team for the 24 years before Murphy arrived, they made up just 10 percent of the 2014-2015 squad.
“When I was at the University of Cincinnati, you go into a lot of the same high schools, and it was somewhat more regional recruiting,” Murphy said. “We got here, and I think having so many Eastern Mass. kids was both a strength and a weakness. I felt for us to reach our potential, we had to go with a much more national approach to our recruiting.”
{shortcode-d414db94b20652ad1b35d5480006d56abcdebee3}
Will Wade, a former assistant coach for the men’s basketball squad, told The Crimson last year that the team’s on-court success has propelled its recruiting success. One of the program’s biggest early catches under Amaker, Oliver McNally ’12, a three-time California Division V state championship winner in high school, had to be convinced that the program could continue to recruit at a high level in the future.
“We had to convince him this would be different, [that] we are going to be able to attract more people of [his] cloth,” Wade said. “I thought he was good for us, and he raised our profile in recruiting.... I think that once we had that first one in the bag, we got some other guys.”
The “other guys” soon became a flood of the nation’s top recruits. Current sophomore Zena Edosomwan became the first Scout.com recruit to sign with an Ivy League School the year McNally graduated, and he turned down basketball powerhouses UCLA and Texas in the process. Freshmen Andre Chatfield and Chris Egi were listed as at least three-star recruits in their draft class. Chatfield turned down offers from two SEC schools—Auburn and Mississippi State—as well as rival Yale, in choosing Harvard. In January, Harvard secured a verbal commitment from high school junior Chris Lewis, the 44th-ranked recruit in the Class of 2016.
Part of the recruiting success has come from Amaker going into areas that his predecessors hardly tackled. From 1970 to 2007—the year Amaker arrived on campus—the team took 64 players from New York, Connecticut, and Maryland combined. None are considered to be recruiting hotbeds for basketball, but they represented the Crimson’s ability to succeed on a regional stage. Yet, during that time period, the team did not win a single Ivy League title.
When former Harvard forward Vince Lackner ’72 played, his teammates largely came from the Northeast. In Lackner’s junior year, 40 percent of the team came from either New York, Connecticut, or Washington, D.C.
Lackner partially credited this to the academic institutions in the region, noting that for his Rhode Island high school, the Ivy League was a common destination. Lackner, who transferred to Harvard after initially attending Williams, said that his indirect route was unusual among his classmates.
“In general, my experience was that boarding schools like Portsmouth served as a pipeline to Harvard,” Lackner said. "In my graduating class, [seven] were admitted, and I was the only one who didn’t go.”

By comparison, Amaker has taken a more national view of recruiting. Over the last seven years, he has taken a combined three players from New York, Connecticut, and Maryland, which is just one more than he has taken from Ontario, according to the Crimson’s data set.
The team has been notably stronger recruiting during the Amaker era in the South, from where much of the nation’s best talent hails. Lewis, if his commitment holds up, would be the fourth Georgia product to come to Harvard since Amaker took the helm of the program, but only the fifth since 1970.
Amaker has pitched Harvard as a 40-year decision, not a four-year decision, recruits have said, noting that Amaker has sold them on the ability to do something at Harvard that has never been done before—not the easiest of feats at the College.
“[Amaker said to me, ‘Harvard’s] the most famous school in the world,’” McNally told The Crimson in 2012. “In every field, athletically and academically, things have been done. Football’s won, soccer’s won, but basketball never had. You can make history. People will remember you and the team you played on as doing something Harvard had never done before, and you can’t really do that in a lot of other fields here.’”
On the gridiron, Murphy has had a similar impact in his 21 years at the helm of the program. Since taking over in 1994, Murphy has had twice as many athletes from Texas on his rosters than did coaches over the previous 24-year span. He has found fertile recruiting grounds in Michigan (20 players) and Georgia (34 players), states that were scarcely tapped before, taking an aggressive recruiting track that has had the department sending letters to top recruits across the country—including eventual 2014 No. 1 NFL draft pick Jadeveon Clowney.

Murphy says that the program—which sends a letter to every high school football program in North America—is comprehensive in its reach to account for a small pool of candidates.
“We have arguably the smallest pool of Division I players on the planet to choose from,” Murphy said. “[To play at Harvard], you have to be a great kid, a great student, and a great athlete.”
The team subscribes to a number of regional recruiting databases to help separate the diamonds from the rough. Sifting through the 10,000 initial “suspects” Murphy says are brought to the table every March is a long and arduous process; the coach admits that the program checks every single one when cutting down the suspect pool to what he calls real prospects. Eventually, that gets whittled down until the group of 30 admits that make up a class remain.
“We don’t know until we go through the information, but most guys aren’t Division I football players,” Murphy said. “Most guys aren’t Harvard students, not all of them are great kids, so once you put it all together in that labor intensive process, you end up rejecting, just as Harvard Admissions does, about 95 percent of them.”
“We aren’t necessarily doing [recruiting] 365 days a year, but we are doing it 300 days a year,” he continued.
The forays into different parts of the country have helped Murphy build a talented and versatile roster. Hodges, from Atlanta by way of North Carolina, led the Ivy League with 8.5 sacks this past year. Senior starting quarterback Conner Hempel, a Kentucky native, finished his career as Harvard’s all-time leader in completion percentage. Senior linebacker Connor Sheehan—whose interception of Yale quarterback Morgan Roberts clinched Harvard’s championship-sealing victory in The Game—is one of three current players on the roster from Austin, Texas. Yet from 1970 to 1993, the team did not have a single player from Austin.
Ultimately, Murphy says that recruiting is at the top of the team’s priority list. The coach says there is little else more important than making sure his team constantly brings in good, fresh talent.
“There are a ton of variables that go into the success of any company, any program, and for us the key one is absolutely recruiting,” Murphy said. “It’s not the only variable, but at the end of the day, it’s the most important variable.”

Athlete hometown data for this story were taken directly from GoCrimson rosters. The data include only men’s varsity basketball and football athletes who were listed on a roster from 1970-1971 to 2014-2015. Athletes who were erroneously left off the roster on the website were not included in the sample, and the sample was not limited to recruited athletes. The data were refined to include only athletes with complete data—athletes missing data were removed from the data set for consistency.
Using a Google-based geocoder, each athlete’s hometown was given a set of coordinates that were mapped onto a topographical map created using D3. All filtering and analysis was done in Python.
