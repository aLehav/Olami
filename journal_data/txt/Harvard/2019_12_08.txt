After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent episode of his wildly popular HBO series, “Last Week Tonight,” John Oliver shockingly revealed to legions of viewers that he and his show had been the subject of a lawsuit behind closed doors, which dragged out over the past two years. The suit was filed by then-CEO of Murray Energy, the nation’s largest privately owned coal company, Bob Murray, or, as Oliver describes him, “geriatric Dr. Evil.” Murray was responding to a 2017 segment in which Oliver detailed, among other things, Murray’s close ties to the current President of the United States, his staunch objection to laws protecting miner’s safety, and the company’s possible culpability in a deadly mine collapse.
Apparently, Bob Murray was deeply troubled by this story, alleging in his suit that, “nothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack.” Even if we take this line as genuine, which would require an extraordinary tolerance for rubbish, Oliver posits that this is an interesting balance of emotional priorities for a man who “oversaw a company whose mine collapse in Utah resulted in the deaths of nine people.” But clearly a comedian mocking him on late night television him for 20 minutes proved truly devastating.
The specifics of the lawsuit, however, are not the only focus of Oliver’s segment. In his typical fashion, the host broadened the scope of his story to a wide critique of so-called SLAPP suits, or “Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation.” Essentially, suits like Murray’s are intended to scare dissenters into silence. Even though they have no legitimate backing and are largely dismissed in court (as this one was) they can still serve their intended purpose — to shut up the critics. The existence of SLAPP suits should be no surprise. Many public figures, including the President himself, have spoken freely about their intent to sue critics into the shadows. President Trump has actually advocated for making laws more lenient when it comes to this kind of legal action. However, this is a much more complicated issue than many are aware.
The formula for Oliver’s show actually hinges on this complexity. He takes something many are peripherally aware of which few understand, and delivers it to his viewers in an incredibly informative package wrapped in witty comedy and satirical graphics. Some of what makes “Last Week Tonight” so illuminating is the level of nuance Oliver provides in a comparatively short time frame.
One of the intricacies of this case that Oliver takes care to highlight is the impact of SLAPP suits on publications fundamentally unlike his own. For many small publications, these suits can be devastating, as the legal baselessness of the claims does not negate the fact that they are costly, time consuming, and often simply too much of a strain on resources for businesses to bear. Not to mention that a suit like this is “a difficult, painful experience” which “plaintiffs can find ways to extend… through intensive discovery requests, depositions and appeals.” Oliver’s own legal dilemma totaled more than $200,000. While he was fortunate to have insurance and the backing of a large company like HBO, few are so lucky.
While 30 states have laws intended to curtail this damaging, circuitous process, the other 20 do not. This allows plaintiffs to circumvent these protections by simply suing in a different state, as Murray did. Oliver delivered the pithy and chilling line, “Lawsuits are like famous Instagram pugs — they don’t have to work to be considered very, very successful. By cultivating a reputation for being aggressively litigious, Murray may have… successfully applied a chokehold to how he is covered.” This leads to Oliver’s final point. As in many of his episodes, he concludes with a sort of call to action, provides a road map for a sort of “what should happen next.” He regales viewers with fascinating, hilarious, yet deeply troubling facts for the first 20 minutes, but then explains exactly what needs to happen to remedy the situation. This time, it is exactly what one would expect: “We badly need effective anti-SLAPP laws nationwide to deter powerful people like Bob Murray from using the courts to shut down people’s legitimate dissent.”
What is unexpected is the grand finale, an incredible five-minute dance sequence set among the bright lights of Time Square and littered with jokes at Murray’s expense. It is spectacular and cathartic. Words do not do it justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you haven’t been keeping up with the latest news in the world of women’s lingerie, you may be shocked to hear that the once beloved Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is cancelled indefinitely. Not Twitter cancelled (that was months ago), like, cancelled cancelled. At its peak in 2001, over 12 million viewers tuned in to ABC to watch the Angels strut down the runway in lingerie and wings. The show’s viewership has declined to less than a third of its 2001 numbers likely as a result of controversies amassed over the past few years.
Fatphobic and transphobic statements by marketing chief Ed Razek in 2018 incited the initial backlash from the public. Razek said he would not cast plus-sized or trans models because the show is a “fantasy.” Later, The New York Times uncovered that CEO Les Wexner had ties to now-deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. To make matters worse, the Times also uncovered that Epstein lured model Alicia Arden to his hotel room in 1997 under the pretense that he was a talent scout for Victoria’s Secret. Of course, these controversies did not bode well for the future of the annual show, but to claim that it was cancelled solely because of them is wildly reductionist; it gives “cancel culture” far too much credit.
What’s more impactful is the fundamental shift in how fashion is consumed; the traditional fashion show is beginning to be replaced with digital media. Take Zac Posen’s Spring Summer 2020 collection; it was presented entirely via 360 degree interactive image technology. The Victoria’s Secret fashion show is exorbitantly expensive, costing the company $20 million in 2016, so when they stopped seeing a direct impact in sales after the show was aired in recent years, a change had to be made.
L Brands, Victoria’s Secret’s parent company, announced that it would evolve the marketing of Victoria's Secret. In an internal memo to employees CEO Les Wexner said that he aimed to curate "exciting and dynamic content and a new kind of event — delivered to our customers on platforms that she’s glued to ... and in ways that will push the boundaries of fashion in the global digital age."
In short, a massive loss in viewership coupled with a lack of short-term sales response doomed the Victoria’s Secret fashion show to (a tentative) extinction. Perhaps this turn of events is for the better, given that the narrow beauty standards for women promoted by the company are losing popularity in favor of body positivity and inclusion — look at Rihanna’s success with Savage X Fenty. Still, it’ll be strange this Winter not seeing the Victoria’s Secret Angels grace Twitter and Instagram feeds as they did so faithfully in years past.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball closed an up-and-down first month of its season in style, cruising past Massachusetts 89-55 at Lavietes Pavilion on Saturday in its last game for two weeks. It snapped a two-game losing streak and was the Crimson’s largest-ever victory against the Minutemen, who still hold a 16-11 series lead against Harvard.
After dropping its final two games of the Orlando Invitational last weekend, the Crimson (6-4) needed a win to avoid heading into the short break at .500 and on a three-game losing streak. Harvard got that crucial win resoundingly, slowly building a big lead in the first half and then dominating the second half of a game it never trailed to send Massachusetts (5-5) to its fifth consecutive loss.
Sophomore Noah Kirkwood and senior Robert Baker led the way for the Crimson with an efficient 19 points apiece. They played just 25 and 20 minutes respectively and shot a combined 14-of-19 from the field, 5-of-9 from three, and 5-of-5 from the line. The 19 points were a career-high for Baker, who has shown flashes of brilliance throughout the season, and a season-high for Kirkwood.
The sterling performance was nothing new for Kirkwood, a 6’7” Ontario native who became one of Harvard’s better players down the stretch last season. He has not lost a beat this year, averaging an efficient 11.2 points per game on 48% shooting from the field and a superb 41% mark from beyond the arc. He has also visibly improved as a playmaker, boosting his assists from 1.9 to 3.4 per contest and cutting his turnovers by nearly a full turnover per game to 2.0.
“[Kirkwood] is arguably our best player, him or [senior point guard] Bryce [Aiken],” junior guard Rio Haskett said. “He just brings a good poise. He’s only a sophomore, but he plays ahead of his time. He’s so mature, and he’s just getting better every year.”
Aiken, generally the Crimson’s leading scorer and one of the highest-usage players in college basketball, took a backseat scoring-wise in this game, taking just two total shots in 19 minutes and playing just three minutes in the second half before being removed with four fouls. But Aiken made his presence known in other ways. He visibly settled down an offense that at times struggled without him, and Harvard was +27 in the 19 minutes he played.
“[Aiken’s] quarterback play — a lot of times he’s in the middle of scoring a lot of points for us but today it was necessary to be a quarterback and find the open people,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “The start we were able to have was because of his effort and his intelligence and how he played and passed and made everyone around him better.”
Aiken also helped key a defense that was locked-in from the start. With less than four minutes to go in the first half and the Crimson leading 37-20, he responded to a steal by Massachusetts’ freshman point guard Sean East II by hustling back and taking a charge from East on the ensuing fastbreak. The drawn charge was emblematic of Harvard’s defensive effort throughout and happened right in front of the Crimson’s bench, yielding the bench’s biggest celebration of the day.
It was one of Harvard’s most well-rounded performances of the season on both ends of the court. The Minutemen came into Saturday shooting a superb 37% from beyond the arc but struggled to the tune of a 3-of-19 performance, with one of their makes coming on a Carl Pierre make on their very first possession. Pierre, a junior guard out of Boston, finished with 10 points on just 2-of-10 shooting, joining freshman center Tre Mitchell (13 points) and sophomore forward Sy Chatman (10) in double-figures.
“I definitely think our emphasis today was our defense,” junior forward Danilo Djuricic said. “Defense is what started up our offense so when we’re playing defense like that everyone’s involved. You saw the bench today — a lot of energy.”
The Crimson was aggressive offensively throughout the game, taking it to the hoop and collecting offensive rebounds against a team that was allowing a 32.2% offensive rebounding rate coming into the game, putting them in the bottom quintile of the country. That mark did not improve Saturday, as Harvard secured 12 offensive rebounds on 23 missed shots and converted them into 17 second-chance points. The Crimson finished with 46 points in the paint, 24 points from three point range, and 17 made free throws as just two of its points came from midrange, basketball’s least efficient area.
“We really felt that they are a team that has pressed a lot and played with a lot of pressure, and in order for you to be successful against that — one, you’ve got to handle the ball, but you need to attack pressure with intelligence and so I thought we did that very well throughout the game,” Amaker said.
Senior forward Chris Lewis, like Aiken, was saddled with foul trouble and was limited to 11 minutes, but his nine points were enough to take him over the 1,000 point plateau for his career, making him the 35th Harvard player to reach the milestone.
The Crimson will look to build on this performance in two weeks when it travels to Washington to face George Washington and then Howard before it heads to California in late December.
