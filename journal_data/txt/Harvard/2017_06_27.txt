After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRAGUE, Czech Republic—Prague is a city to purposely get lost in. After eating dinner on my very first day here, I strolled through the winding, cobble-stoned streets to find a tram stop. What I stumbled upon instead was the famous Charles Bridge. There were tons of people, but the lighting was just right, and the atmosphere was perfect. I was amazed at my fortune of having accidentally come across a must-see attraction so soon. It was the perfect end to one of the best days of my life.
Have you ever desired something so badly that you cannot talk about it without sounding desperate or painfully wistful? That’s been my experience with the idea of traveling the world. For as long as I can remember, I have always looked around me and thought there has got to be more to everyday life than “this.” “This” meaning staying in the same place, seeing the same things, interacting with the same type of people—what I call being stagnant. Pair this viewpoint with romanticized pictures, books, and movies, and I wanted nothing more than to be in places like London or Paris, not in Michigan or Texas. So when I realized the first day of summer and the first day of my travels to Prague happened to coincide, the sentimental side of me automatically kicked in. It carried weight for me because it was a new beginning of what I hope to be a lifestyle. This is the defining moment of my summer.
Traveling on my own to a foreign country is not something I am able to take lightly. It is especially significant to be a young, black woman traveling to a place where you rarely see people like yourself. I was a little wary, but I did my research ahead of time and spoke to people who had been in my position. Though I heard of both good and bad experiences, I have decided to own my time in Prague. I’ve been here for half a week, and I walk through the streets with confidence as if I too, though a visitor, deserve to be here to partake in this place’s history and beauty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, while scrolling through my monotonous Facebook feed filled with people complaining about Trump this and Trump that, I came across a post that stood out to me. Posted by my most liberal friend whom I love dearly (even though we rarely agree on anything), it focused on scientist Veronika Hubney being interrupted by a man when explaining her groundbreaking research. As a fellow woman with a passion for STEM—shoutout to the 20 hours a week I spent on CS50—I was outraged that her male panelist felt himself in a position to “mansplain” Hubney’s research to her. However, after finishing the minute-long clip, I found that incident was not the video’s most disturbing element.
Following Hillary’s loss in the 2016 presidential election, feminists have become stunningly more aware of the inequalities and hardships faced by women every day solely because of their gender. While I agree that it is of utmost importance to recognize where sexism is present and can hide in the world around us, there is an error in the way feminist media tells its stories that seems to hinder society from moving in a direction towards equality.
For example, the title of the clip read “This scientist just had her own research mansplained to her.” While surely gripping, neither it nor the video’s description utilized Hubney’s name. As a result, the clip seemed to be solely focused on the negative—the fact that Hubney was mistreated by a man in an offensive manner—rather than praising her stellar new research.
Shedding light on issues of sexism is necessary, but if we really want to make progress regarding the way women are treated and regarded, we should speak of them in a manner we wish others to adopt as well. I was disappointed to find that, after highlighting the interruption, it failed to discuss what Hubney’s work was even about.
Here lies the problem. Following Trump’s presidential win, liberal feminist media has chosen to primarily focus on the ways women are mistreated in society. Yes, Hillary’s loss has demonstrated that the United States continues to view objectively more qualified women as lesser than their male counterparts, but it has also shown us that, now more than ever, it is important for women to become and remain powerful. A female president does not sit on the horizon if our country remains focused on what the world is doing to women, rather than what women are doing for the world.
It is a shame that Hubney first appeared on my timeline as a victim rather than a warrior. It is regrettable that she was a victim to begin with, but this media portrayal stripped her of her power nearly as much as did her male panelist. I want to hear about what she is contributing to the worlds of string theory and quantum gravity, which I can barely begin to comprehend. I want to hear about all the women thriving in STEM fields despite the discrimination they face. I want to hear about all the women who are choosing to continue to pursue politics, and who are succeeding, even when the current state of our nation could not be less in their favor.
Ever since last November, the glass ceiling has begun to appear further and further away. Liberal feminist media is pulling women back instead of urging them to run towards it. The perpetual frustration with the United States I see on my Facebook timeline everyday should be encouraging people to get involved, to fight for what they believe is right, and to stand strong during turmoil. Get angry, but channel it into something outside of a perpetual cycle of negativity.
Women always have been and always will be immensely powerful. Let’s keep talking about that.

Now that University President Drew G. Faust has announced that she will step down in June 2018, the Harvard Corporation will exercise its most visible influence over campus life: selecting the University’s next president. Like any leadership change, it’s a pivotal moment for Harvard, and the decision the Corporation makes will steer the centuries-old University’s course for years to come. Here’s a look at what the Corporation is, who sits on it, and what it does.
What is the Harvard Corporation? 
The Harvard Corporation is the smaller and more powerful of Harvard’s two governing bodies.  The oldest corporation in the United States, it lists 13 members, including the president, who sets the board’s agenda but does not vote at meetings.
From setting Harvard’s budgets to selecting the deans of individual schools, the Corporation has the final say on any number of the most pressing issues facing Harvard. Its members help Harvard raise money and serve as a sounding board for the president as she makes major University decisions.  In just the last few years, the Corporation accepted a proposal to change Harvard Law School’s seal and it must approve any revisions to a controversial policy penalizing membership in single-gender social organizations.
Members typically convene in Harvard Yard’s Loeb House seven or eight times during the academic year and head to Cape Cod for an annual retreat in the summer.
Who sits on the Corporation, and how does one become a member? 
A carefully curated mix of prominent academics, lawyers, and business magnates make up the the Corporation’s membership. True to its secretive reputation, the group is self-selecting; members decide on candidates to replace their outgoing colleagues, and a majority vote of approval from the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s larger and less powerful governing body, seals the deal.
Between its 12 members, the body tries to maintain a portfolio of expertise—for example, when former Corporation member and investment manager James R. Rothenberg ’68 died in July 2015, the governing board lost both a friend and an important source of financial wisdom.
The Corporation quickly sought out David M. Rubenstein, a billionaire philanthropist and private equity titan, to help govern the wealthiest University in the world.
But it wasn’t always this way. For over three centuries, the Corporation had only six members, plus the University president—a strikingly small board compared to those of most universities. By the first decade of the 21st century, its size was no longer tenable, and faculty were raising concerns about the body’s transparency. So in 2010, the Corporation approved a sweeping set of reforms that doubled its membership, created specialized committees, and instituted term limits.
Now, 12 members sit on the Corporation: William F. Lee ’72, a Boston lawyer and the body’s senior fellow; Paul J. Finnegan ’75, an investment banker and the board’s treasurer; Lawrence S. Bacow, former Tufts University president; James W. Breyer, partner at the venture capitalist firm Accel Partners; Kenneth I. Chenault, CEO of American Express; Karen Gordon Mills ’75, a senior fellow of Harvard Business School and Harvard Kennedy School; Jessica T. Mathews ’67, former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Susan L. Graham ’64, computer scientist from the University of California Berkeley; Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67, a Boston business executive; Shirley M. Tilghman, Princeton’s former president; and Theodore V. Wells Jr., a lawyer.
Keohane is the first Corporation member to “term-out”—in other words, leave because her two six-year terms are up. Rubenstein will take her spot in July.
What is the Board of Overseers, then? 
The Board of Overseers—which is comprised of 30 Harvard degree holders elected by alumni vote in May each year—is the less powerful of the University’s two governing bodies. Most universities have only one board, so Harvard’s split model is somewhat of an anomaly among its peer institutions. The Overseers focus on academic affairs, with visiting committees that oversee each of Harvard’s individual schools. Those committees report their findings to the Corporation, and the two bodies meet in a joint session when Corporation members convene on campus.
What role will the Corporation have in the presidential search? 
In short, a large one. As in previous presidential searches, the entire Corporation will sit on Harvard’s presidential search committee—with one significant difference. This will mark the first presidential search since the body increased its membership from six to 12.
The increase in size will bring the presidential search committee—which will also include three yet unnamed members of the Board of Overseers—to 15, the largest the committee has ever been in Harvard’s history.
For the next few months, members of the Corporation will fly around the country and convene in closed-door meetings to whittle down a list of prospective candidates—which typically begins with hundreds of names—to just one. After the Board of Overseers gives their consent, the University will make public the name of Harvard’s next president.
The process will likely last into 2018, with Faust set to step down shortly after the 2018 academic year closes.
