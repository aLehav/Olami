In an effort to counteract the potential spread of the H1N1 “swine flu,” Harvard University Health Services is offering earlier vaccinations for the seasonal flu at more locations, intensifying outreach about preventative measures, and preparing for the worst-case scenario: a flu epidemic.
There will be a 150 percent increase in the amount of seasonal flu vaccine available this year, and more UHS employees are now licensed to give the vaccine, according to UHS director David S. Rosenthal ’59.
UHS will receive the increased supply of seasonal flu vaccine tomorrow, and the vaccine will be administered at 40 different sites—about twice as many as last year, Rosenthal said. 
But these increased shipments of vaccinations will not include those for H1N1. 
The H1N1 vaccine is still in development by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and should be released this fall. 
Rosenthal said that optimistically, the vaccine should be ready by the middle of October. 
The CDC recommends that certain groups receive the vaccine first, including pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions.
“Asymptomatic college-age students are not on the priority list right now,” Rosenthal said.
In the meantime, the University is escalating its outreach efforts to publicize its advice about preventative measures, according to University spokesman Kevin Galvin. 
Rosenthal said that he anticipates a rise in the number of cases when students arrive on campus, and encourages everybody who has a fever and a cough to be evaluated by UHS.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent an e-mail to Harvard College students and parents last Wednesday initiating the outreach campaign, and UHS held a meeting with freshmen parents last Thursday advising them about the flu.
Rosenthal said that the University is also creating emergency plans to help  cope with the large number of additional cases. 
He said that a hotline is in progress so that faculty, staff, students, and parents can call and speak directly to a “healthcare professional.” 
Rosenthal added that since the CDC recommends that people with the flu be isolated until 24 hours after they are fever-free, UHS is also trying to locate enough space throughout the university to isolate ill students who are not in single bedrooms.
But Rosenthal recommended that regardless of whether or not the university experiences an epidemic, students should continue to practice good hygiene and not come in close contact with people who appear ill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The six working groups charged with addressing the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ $143 million budget shortfall are scrambling to regroup as their deadline for drafting budget cut recommendations looms at the end of October.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith formed the groups in May to outline potential reductions or ways to restructure their respective divisions—student life, College academics, the humanities, the sciences, the social sciences, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The groups, which are composed of faculty, staff and students, have no formal power over FAS’ budget and discussions are confidential.
But with two months remaining, many of the groups have only met once—at an introductory meeting in May. Some faculty and student members said they have not received any communications about the meetings over the summer months.
“I confess I know nothing of the schedule of the working group and have not heard anything recently,” Lowell House Master and student life committee member Diana L. Eck wrote in an e-mailed statement.
According to a rough timeline posted on the FAS Planning Web site, the groups were intended to address a number of issues at the “initial meetings” in May and June, such as to “establish financial and programmatic goals, define data/analysis needs going forward, [and] define roles and responsibilities.”
Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10, who is on the student life working group, said that a joint meeting for the two College working groups in May focused on broad principles for the committees’ future meetings rather than concrete action plans.
The two College working groups, chaired by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, met together once as a larger group in late May and have not received any communications since.
Still, as the first day of classes approaches, some committees appear to be in a state of disarray.
English Professor Louis Menand is listed on the planning Web site as a member of the College academics working group, but Menand is on academic leave for the Fall semester.
The four student members selected in May by the UC have not been added to the Web site.
The humanities working group, chaired by Humanities Dean Diana Sorensen, saw its membership list overhauled in late June. Ten professors who were initially listed as members in June were removed and six other professors were added to the list.
According to a humanities professor who asked to remain anonymous, Sorensen said that the division must cut $19 million, or 25 percent, of their $76 million in faculty salaries and benefits. Smith had said several times in the spring there are no plans to reduce faculty salaries.
In an e-mailed statement to The Crimson on Saturday, Smith appeared to walk back some of his previous statements that suggested the $143 million budget gap would be closed over the course of two fiscal years.
“The goal is a balanced FAS budget sometime in the future, not specific cuts or specific dollar amounts in each division or in the College,” he wrote.
After the working groups submit their recommendations in October, the Academic Planning Group—composed of FAS’ highest-level deans—will discuss potential budget cuts in November and December. They also plan to float ideas to the FAS community before finalizing the budget in spring 2010.
“Maybe it’s just a necessary step that [the working groups] meet and talk and can’t come up with anything except for minor modifications...and this time they say, ‘Hey, we gave you guys a shot, and you didn’t come up with anything,’” said a humanities department chair who asked not to be named in order to protect the department.
While on such a fast-paced schedule, the working groups’ success may hinge on their chairs’ management skills.
The social sciences working group, chaired by social science dean Stephen M. Kosslyn, has already met several times well into the summer. According to working group member and Economics Department Chair John Y. Campbell, the group is about to start the second phase of their discussions in September.
Over the summer, their working group engaged in the first phase, “divergent thinking,” where the working groups’ 11 members proposed ideas without worrying about their practicality or desirability. Three more members will soon join the working group for the second phase: “convergent thinking,” where the working group will decide what to recommend to Smith by the end of October.

AT&T users venturing into the Quad may no longer have to worry about dropped calls or spotty cell phone service, starting tomorrow.A “cell on wheels”—a trailer containing signal transmission and reception equipment known as a COW—has recently been set up next to Cabot House’s Barnard Hall, located on the southwest corner of the Quad.The “visually obtrusive” COW serves as a temporary solution for providing reliable AT&T wireless service in the Quad until a permanent antenna is installed next fall, following city and state approval, said Zachary M. Gingo ’98, director of Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Facilities Management and Operations. The permanent antenna will be placed on the roof of the Student Organization Center at Hilles, hidden from view.Harvard has been working with AT&T on the issue since last winter, and the service provider will fund the bulk of the project, Gingo said.He added that Harvard is “actively exploring” similar partnerships with other providers, as students have reported reception problems with companies other than Verizon, in particular, Sprint and T-Mobile.Though students have long pushed for improved cell phone reception in the Quad, the problem was brought to the immediate attention of Harvard administrators following the May 18 shooting in Kirkland House, when several Quad residents reported not receiving the University’s emergency text message notifications.Undergraduate Council representative and Currier House resident George J.J. Hayward ’11, who adopted improved cell phone service in the Quad as a central component of his election campaign last year, collected over 300 messages from Quad residents about poor reception over the last academic year.Hayward, who is also a Crimson editorial writer, could not be reached for comment.He told The Crimson in May that once he was able to “demonstrate substantial concern,” administrators readily agreed to pursue the issue.—Staff writer June Q.

Harvard will create a Safety Advisory Committee and task the University ombudsman with addressing public safety concerns in an effort to improve relations between University police and the community amid long-standing complaints of unfair treatment of black students and professors, University officials announced Friday.The newly adopted measures follow a report examining the Harvard University Police Department’s practices released in April that recommended a series of policy changes to “achieve the shared goal of a welcoming, safe, and open environment.”Following an incident of alleged racial profiling last August, University President Drew G. Faust charged an independent, six-member committee with scrutinizing the diversity training and recruitment efforts of the Harvard police force.In the weeks before the announcement, black student and faculty leaders had been pushing for the University to address what they viewed as racial profiling by a predominantly white campus police department.They pointed to the August incident—in which a black high school student was approached by University police while trying to remove the lock from his bike—as well as two other incidents in recent years.The policy changes are designed to “advance the open communication and trust necessary both for HUPD to accomplish its critical public safety mission and for the broader educational environment Harvard seeks to foster,” University Provost Steven E. Hyman said in a statement.The University Safety Advisory Committee will advise Harvard administrators and serve as an umbrella group to the existing safety committee at the College.Kennedy School Professor Mark H. Moore, who served on the original committee that drafted the report, will chair the University committee comprised of faculty, staff, students, and Harvard police representatives. The announcement did not clarify the specific responsibilities of the safety committee. The University did not respond to a request for comment over the weekend. University Ombudsman Lydia L. Cummings ’70 will absorb public safety ombudsman responsibilities in her role and bring campus concerns to the attention of administrators and the University Safety Advisory Committee.In addition to implementing the recommendations, the announcement stated that the University will also expand the role of the police department’s diversity and community liaison to improve outreach efforts.—Staff writer June Q. Wu can be reached at junewu@fas.harvard.edu.

The National Institutes for Health has renewed funding for the Harvard University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) with a $18.1 million grant over the next five years.The grant focuses on bolstering the interdisciplinary study of AIDS and HIV, by bringing together scientists from fields such as economics, ethics, immunology, and virology.“It’s been a terrific source of funds for us to launch new efforts and be able to help recruit new faculty,” said Bruce D. Walker, director of the Harvard CFAR and a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Harvard CFAR is one of only 20 accredited AIDS research centers nationwide. According to Walker, the Harvard CFAR’s role in studying the intersection of the HIV and Tuberculosis epidemics is just one example of how otherwise independent investigations can come together at the center. “We hope to set up more interdisciplinary collaborations between people who have very different kinds of AIDS research specialization, whether they are an immunologist, behavioral scientist, epidemiologist, or statistician,” said Myron “Max” Essex, the associate director of the Harvard CFAR and a professor of health sciences at the Harvard School of Public Health. The Harvard CFAR is managed by the Harvard Initiative for Global Health (HIGH), an interfaculty initiative of the President and Provost’s Office. “Broadly, our mission is to train and educate the next generation of global health leaders and generate new knowledge that leads to addressing the major challenges facing the world in global health,” said Thomas A. La Salvia, executive director of HIGH. By connecting Harvard researchers from different schools to the issues in global health, HIGH serves as a solid platform for CFAR, La Salvia said. Building Bees From BoltsBoston’s Museum of Science will soon have a new exhibition explaining the behavior of bees thanks to a $10 million, five-year National Science Foundation Expeditions in Computing Grant. The collaborators, including faculty at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and a number of affiliate institutions, hope the bee models will lead to advances in small scale robotics, power sources and sensors, and biologically-inspired computer programming. The relatively new grant was developed last year by the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and is awarded to three institutions annually. It funds research rooted in basic science that is of “high risk but potentially high reward” said Gu-Yeon Wei, an associate professor of electrical engineering at SEAS and co-principal investigator of the project. “This is such cool research, as the practical, technological aspects of the project dovetail with deep fundamental issues in computer science, robotics, biology, and engineering,” said Cherry A. Murray, Dean of SEAS, in the press release.Wei recalled walking by Robert J. Wood’s nanorobotics lab—where he demonstrated the first flight of a robotic fly in 2007—and thinking “Hey, wouldn’t it be interesting if we took Rob’s insect robots and attached a brain to them?”  They then began to think of the challenges associated with an entire colony and coordinating its activities. The project now has three main thrusts: brain, body, and colony. The researchers aim to build a colony of robotic bees that can be individually programmed to perform actions that benefit the hive as a whole, said Wood, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the engineering school and the project’s principal investigator.  “The inspiration came from observations of actual bees,” Wood said. “Not only bees themselves, but also the interactions bees have with each other and how they cooperate to do things that are much greater than some of the parts.” “This was a great opportunity to bring together traditionally separate research areas under the focus of a common goal,” he added.—Staff writer Alissa M.

Harvard Law School’s Legal Services Center, which provides low-income Boston-area clients with free or reduced fee lawyering and students with law practice experience, has recently seen its budget cut by roughly a third, and four of its 13 clinics have been relocated to the Law School’s Cambridge campus from Jamaica Plain.Three of the four clinics that moved in mid-August facilitate community business development and comprise the Community Enterprise Project (CEP), and the fourth aids families with children who have been exposed to family violence, according to Elaine McArdle, spokeswoman for HLS’s Office of Clinical and Pro Bono Programs.LSC’s 37 percent funding cut came in response to a mandate to cut HLS’s clinical programs budget by 10 percent, according to McArdle. She said that LSC previously had a budget of roughly $2 to $3 million each year—10 times the amount of funding for most other HLS legal clinics.According to HLS spokesman Robb London, LSC previously received roughly 40 percent of HLS’s overall clinical funding, but only 20 percent of HLS’s clinical students worked at the Center. He said that of the funds cut from LSC, 22 percent would be reallocated to the units moving to Cambridge and the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, which provides free legal services for low-income people in Middlesex and Suffolk counties. McArdle said that the nine remaining LSC clinics will be working with a roughly 15 percent budget cut.“Our goal was to have the least possible impact that we could on clients and students,” McArdle said, noting that other HLS legal clinics provide services that overlapped with LSC’s. She said that substantially cutting funding for smaller, non-LSC clinics was “an untenable choice” that would have been tantamount to eliminating them entirely.Lisa P. Dealy, assistant dean for clinical and pro bono programs, said that due to the budget cuts, three LSC employees have been laid off—an attorney, a receptionist, and a managing attorney who did not work directly with students and clients. According to London, LSC previously had 25 employees, nine of whom have been moved to Cambridge.Robert Greenwald, a senior LSC clinical instructor who will be serving as the Center’s managing attorney this year, emphasized that the Jamaica Plain clinics are committed to providing legal services to the community, despite the cuts. But he also said that while administrators “did their best to minimize the impact [of the cuts] on both students and services,” there was “no question [that] it’s not possible to maintain the same level of service” after the changes.Brian K. Price, a clinical law professor who oversees CEP, said that his unit’s clientele would now expand beyond low-income clients, and that CEP will be renamed the Transactional Law Clinics to reflect the broader mandate. McArdle said that moving CEP did not detract from LSC’s core mission of poverty law. “Obviously economic development is important to the community, but it’s a different mission than, say, helping someone stay in their home,” McArdle said.Dealy, the assistant dean, said that the decision to move the four clinics was also driven in part by a desire to enhance Law School curricula and strengthen the connection between clinical classroom work and fieldwork. McArdle also said that locating the clinics in Cambridge may be more convenient for clients as well, especially those coming from communities on the T’s Red Line. She said that Dorchester provides 31 percent of LSC’s clients—nearly double the amount that comes from Jamaica Plain—and Mattapan provides another 8 percent.But Price, the CEP director, said that it was too early to tell whether the move would make the four clinics more or less convenient to reach, saying only that he and the staff would be working to make services as accessible as possible for past and future clients. McArdle said that she and Price are working on an outreach campaign for CEP both in traditional Boston neighborhoods as well as areas like Cambridge and Somerville.McArdle said that despite the potential benefits of relocating the four clinics—a “cost-neutral” move—ultimately the reorganization was prompted by the budget cutting process. These decisions were made now because the Law School had to take a broad look at its clinical programs, she said. But some believe that even if students find it easier to participate in clinical services, they will not necessarily extract the same experience that they would have if they were actually working in the community. “If you look at the history of the Legal Services Center and its founding inclinations, there’s a very large element to it of being rooted in the community,” said James K. Jacobs ’72, a CEP clinical instructor. He said that moving clinics to Cambridge would detract from that character and make it more difficult for students to embed themselves in the communities they serve, even if clients do continue to make the commute.“You’re not in the community when you’re in the law school setting, especially when you’re in one so exalted, rightfully or wrongfully, like Harvard,” Jacobs said.—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Art historian Melissa McCormick received tenure from the East Asian Languages and Civilizations department this July, becoming a professor of Japanese art and culture.Her research on the Tale of Genji, a seminal Japanese novel composed by a woman over 1000 years ago, and her work on the relationship between painting and literature in pre-modern Japan have helped bring her to the forefront of her field.“She is certainly more than deserving [of tenure],” said History of Art and Architecture Associate Professor Yukio Lippit ’93, McCormick’s husband and a fellow member of the East Asia Art History Program. “As both a spouse and a colleague, I think it is wonderful.”McCormick’s role in her department—that of teacher and researcher—will not change significantly now that she has received tenure, said Wilt Idema, the chair of the East Asian Languages and Civilizations department. But the psychology of her job has shifted.“There is much less anxiety,” Idema said. “Much of the pressure is taken off.”“I kind of feel like I will have more fun with my work, with my research,” McCormick said on receiving tenure. “Just somehow psychologically it is liberating that you can explore more areas and do so with utter psychological freedom.”McCormick said she intends to do further research on women’s roles in 16th- and 17th-century Japan, a period after the Tale of Genji was produced when dominant scholarship holds that women were not as influential as they had been in the 15th century.By studying paintings called Hakubyo—literally “white lines,” for the negative space around the ink of the illustrations—McCormick said she is “trying to show that that is not the case and that women had continued to compose narratives and poetry.”Last year, when Harvard’s endowment plunged, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith instituted a temporary hiring freeze. But McCormick’s hiring process was not affected by last year’s freeze because she was already in the tenure track, a path Smith stipulated would not be affected by the alteration in hiring patterns.“The school is really keeping good on its promise and promoting from within the University, which is very exciting,” McCormick said. “I think people had been wary pre-tenure, but now I think there is a feeling that they are fulfilling the commitment.”McCormick taught at Columbia University prior to coming to Harvard in 2005, when she began as the John L. Loeb Associate Professor of the Humanities.As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, McCormick anticipated a career in modern dance.“I was very much influenced by East Asian philosophy—reducing things to the minimum, reducing illusionism,” McCormick said. “All of those things were appealing to me in the modern dance form, and I felt an affinity for them when I started studying Japanese art.”Though she is now a far cry from a dance career, it seems McCormick has found a sturdy path.“The most incredible thing about getting tenure,” she said, “is knowing that your life isn’t going to change.”—Staff writer Elyssa A.

Thesis writers, students working in labs, international students, and members of 19 varsity sports team will likely be able to stay on campus during Harvard's Jan.4 through Jan. 24 J-Term—everyone else, probably not.
While exceptions will be made for certain cases and some clubs such as the Hasting Pudding Theatricals also may be allowed to stay on campus over the break, College officials do not plan on allowing more than 1,000 undergraduates to stay on campus over the nearly three week long gap, according to Interim Dean of Advising Programs Inge-Lise Ameer. Students who are allowed to stay on campus will eat in Annenberg. The application is scheduled to come out in the next few weeks and will be due in October.
The teams that will be allowed to stay on campus include basketball, swimming, and track.
For more information on J-Term plans, read Monday's Crimson article here.
