On Thursday night, Berklee College of Music celebrated the career of Hal Crook, an internationally-known jazz trombonist, a graduate of Berklee, and a professor at the college since 1986. Students and alumni packed into Berklee Performance Center for “The Music of Hal Crook: Set Me Free,” a retirement concert featuring Crook and many of his former students. The performers included Grammy-winning vocalist and bassist Esperanza Spalding, who graduated from Berklee in 2005, and drummer and composer Antonio Sanchez, who graduated in 1997 and recently received a Grammy for his original score for the film “Birdman.” The concert’s first half showcased Crook’s jazz compositions, while the second featured his contemporary music ensemble Behind These Eyes. The earlier part offered a fascinating look into Crook’s varied repertoire and his passion for his instrument, but the next proved less engaging.
Crook’s jazz composition “Set Me Free” was both the program’s namesake and its opening number. The piece brought to the stage many of Crook’s former students, including Spalding, Sanchez, saxophonist Chris Cheek, pianist Leo Genovese, and guitarist Lionel Loueke. The piece explored pattern and repetition, with variations on a theme played by several different instruments at once. Crook opted for a democratic vision of the ensemble, in which all the instruments spoke with equal intensity. While such an approach risked producing a fragmented piece, the skills of the individual musicians brought their instruments into dialogue instead of conflict. Ever the teacher, Crook allowed his former students their own solos. As each individual played his or her part, there was an undeniable effervescence palpable not only in the music—which included a solo meant to be played by hitting the piano with one’s fists—but also in the cheers of the audience. All told, “Set Me Free” provided an excellent example of both the lively experimentation and serious technical demands of Crook’s music.
The next pieces on the program pushed fewer musical boundaries than “Set Me Free” but matched the opener’s excitement. The buoyantly rhythmic “Never Again” featured more cohesiveness in the ensemble, as well as strangely but delightfully twisted guitar lines. “Nothing to Lose” showcased Spalding’s richly expressive bass, which brought back the tension of “Set Me Free” and primed the audience for Spalding’s vocals in the next piece, “Blue Confessions.” “Blue Confessions” retained more familiar jazz elements than the other pieces, almost as if Crook were recognizing the lines without necessarily always coloring within them. Crook himself played the trombone in each of these pieces with impressive skill.
However, Crook’s pop-inflected pieces were less varied than his jazz pieces, making the latter half of the concert feel like one endless song. His contemporary ensemble, Behind These Eyes, began the second part with the energetic, almost frenetic composition sharing their name. The song seemed more a series of musical vignettes than a coherent narrative, characterized by traditional blues sound but also interspersed with a variety of themes, only some of which returned throughout the composition. This lack of unity gave the music a strangely unsettled quality that prevented the piece from reaching a true emotional climax. “What Is Going On” was especially perplexing, as the lyrics felt strangely detached from the music. Crowd-pleasing vocal and instrumental solos punctuated the second half, but overall Behind These Eyes failed to maintain the excitement of the opening jazz numbers.
Nevertheless, the concert successfully showcased both Crook’s endlessly inventive compositions and his own playing. The presence of so many well-known musicians onstage with Crook also testified to his importance as a teacher as well as a composer and performer. Though uneven in quality, the concert offered an engaging tribute to Crook and his influence.

If nothing else, the A.R.T.’s production of “1984,” running Feb. 14 to Mar. 6 on the Loeb Mainstage, makes incontrovertible that Orwell’s dystopian novel is uniquely suited to the stage. The show is genuinely chilling. Through intense, unremitting artistic direction based largely around harsh noises and flashing bright lights, the production enables itself to achieve a visceral effect on the viewer that is simply beyond the capacities of a novel. So while the show does suffer from flaws in pacing and some suboptimal directorial choices, it is necessary viewing for anyone who found Orwell’s original compelling.
Script-wise, the show is primarily a straight adaptation of the original novel, save for moments of framing at the play’s beginning and end. The show opens on Winston (Matthew Spencer) writing in his secret diary, the contents of which are shown to the audience through an overhead projector—an interesting, if rather blunt, incorporation of the themes of surveillance and technology that dominate the novel. Beads of what at first glance appear to be red ink fall onto the paper: Winston has gotten a nosebleed. This visceral intensity does not abate but rather intensifies as the play proceeds: Soon, with blaring, alarm-like noises and flashing white lights, a set of actors appears around Winston and begins discussing his diary from a future, post-Big Brother perspective. The juxtaposition between Winston and the modern observers is well-executed—in particular, Spencer impressively conveys the confusion and frustration of seeing these people with whom he is unable to communicate via body language. But since these future readers are dropped from the play until its conclusion, they ultimately feel unnecessary.
The adaptation also handles the story’s pacing rather clumsily. While both the first half hour, before Winston and Julia (Hara Yannas) begin their relationship, and the last, when Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love for reprogramming, are compelling and tightly crafted, the depiction of the relationship itself is highly flawed. Given the intensity and disorientation of the play’s beginning and end, its middle is regrettably boring. Yannas is handily out-acted by the rest of the cast—Spencer’s talents are far better used opposite, for example, Tim Dutton, who plays O’Brien. Additionally, the directors inexplicably choose to show Winston and Julia’s apartment on the screen that initially featured Winston’s diary, and so there is no way to know for sure whether or not those scenes are pre-recorded. “1984” derives much of its power from the physical presence of its actors: It is far more affecting, for example, to see Winston tortured in the flesh than it would be to view the scene on film. By showing these scenes between Winston and Julia only on camera, the show loses this salient advantage for a good third of its length.
Nevertheless, the production is overall a success, for the simple reason that it provides more than adequate reason for its own existence. Each flashing light, each painfully dissonant noise, creates for the viewer a dimension of the disturbing that cannot possibly be achieved by ink and paper alone. “1984” in its original form is intellectually chilling, but the stage production is able to achieve a baser, more visceral terror than the original could ever hope to access. While the script and the direction are rather out of sync in terms of quality—curious, given that the adaptors and directors are one and the same—the latter more than makes up for the flaws of the former. Bolstered by impressive set changes and great acting from the majority of the cast, “1984” is a production that, while somewhat uneven, is eminently worth seeing.

Dirty city streets, alcoholic fathers, depressed mothers, and the unexpected sickness of seemingly harmless people make up the horror of Peter Straub’s stories in his aptly named newest collection, “Interior Darkness.” Each tale in the volume is set in familiar American suburban and urban settings, and each character seems to resemble someone familiar too—perhaps that quiet boy in math class back in high school, or the shy kid two blocks down. What makes these scary stories scary is their familiarity, and Straub succeeds most when his pieces are firmly rooted in the gritty details of reality.
In tales like “Blue Rose” and “The Juniper Tree,” Straub grounds the action in everyday life to a chilling and shiver-inducing effect. The description of a seemingly meek young boy’s cruelty in “Blue Rose” is more than enough to induce nightmares. The intellectual demeanor of the boy disguises his secret inclinations to kill and harm others and allows him to suffer no consequences for his actions. Most disturbingly, at the end of the story, the boy has grown into a man, still feels no remorse, and is able to blend into the world seamlessly. “The Juniper Tree” also feels authentic and personal. It recounts an experience of trauma from a boy’s childhood, an event which later leads him to become a writer though he never quite overcomes his past distress. Straub paints a vivid scene of decaying cities or suburbs in both stories by providing grimy details like the weeds growing in the cracked sidewalks and the paint peeling off old houses. The ugliness of these details ironically makes for beautiful prose, and the setting is so real that the story almost becomes that of one’s own neighborhood, making it all the more terrifying.
In stories like “The Buffalo Hunter,” Straub strays a little more from the commonplace. For most of the take, Straub does what he does best, giving an excruciatingly detailed account of the mental workings of the ordinary—though perhaps a bit antisocial—Bob Bunting and his overactive imagination as he goes through his mundane life. However, the story ends with a burst of fantasy, which is disappointing as there had previously been no elements in the story that defied the laws of science and reality. The addition of magic undoes the build-up of grubby tangibility in the rest of the piece, and the ending loses emotional tension.
“Interior Darkness” also includes some shorter, more experimental stories. “A Short Guide to the City” takes the reader on a tour through various urban landmarks while also giving the history of a serial killer in the town (and the much more disturbing public reaction). “In the Realm of Dreams” is barely half a page long and provides a snapshot of a war veteran’s haunted sleep. Background details are left to the imagination in the shorter tales, and Straub plunges deeply and briefly into intense sensory description. The shorter pieces pack a more concentrated punch, like a shot of liquor, whereas the longer stories might have an effect more like beer—more diluted, but in the end achieving the same effect.
Straub also examines certain aspects of human nature. He brings up thought-provoking ideas in “The Buffalo Hunter”: “Bunting realized that if something happened in your mind, it had happened—you had a memory of it, you could talk about it. It changed you in the same way as an event in the world.” In the long run, there was very little difference between events in the world and events in the mind, because one reality inhabited them both. Straub proposes an interesting version of mental reality, and the rest of the story sets about to prove or disprove it. “A Short Guide to the City” also provides a chilling insight: “Violence, it is felt though unspoken, is the physical form of sensitivity. The city believes this. Incompletion, the lack of referent which strands you in the realm of pure idea, demands release from itself.” The inevitability of an inclination toward violence and cruelty is a recurring theme in Straub’s stories, and as one might expect, “Interior Darkness” gives an analysis of the psychological darkness in Straub’s characters.
Peter Straub’s new collection could not be more fittingly named. The stories probe at and unearth the twisted darkness that lies inside Straub’s characters—and perhaps inside every person to some extent. Straub’s protagonists are murderers and victims alike, and he dissects their thoughts and draws the sickness inside them out in the open. Because the horror of these pieces is based on the interior murkiness of human nature rather than external or supernatural forces, Straub’s stories are most frightening when they are most realistic, with characters that seem like they could be living around the corner.

2015 was a phenomenal year for video games. From "Bloodborne" to "Fallout 4," players leveled up, teamed up, and explored worlds both familiar and fantastic. After the chaos of 2014’s Gamergate controversy, 2015 felt like a return to order, a return to games as challenges of mechanical skill, free from the social criticism which incited the aforementioned backlash—back to gittin’ gud and pwning n00bs.
Released only twelve days into 2016, "That Dragon, Cancer" seems to be the opposite of the games above. While many of the best games of 2015 offer hours of gameplay and encourage mastery of complex rulesets, TDC is effectively a short, two-hour stroll through an art gallery, asking you to walk from room to room and contemplate the pieces therein. However, TDC’s small scope hides its profundity and maturity: The game lets you point-and-click your way through the dramatized experiences and psychological landscape of two parents—Amy and Ryan Green, the creators of the game—as they deal with the treatment and death of their cancer-stricken, four-year old son, Joel.
The somber topic begs the question: How could such a game ever be fun? It’s obvious why skill-based games are enjoyable. After all, it’s fun to master game mechanics and beat opponents through better strategy and skill. If a game has enough players interacting with and against each other, dominant strategies emerge. Players ignore all other ways of playing the game and focus on one strategy—the right one, the winning one.
These games imply that every choice has a clear and immediate consequence, that there is always a ‘right’ choice. As a result, they address a desire for agency within all of us, a desire to shape our own lives according to our actions. As with skill-based games, many people believe that they can ‘meta-game’ life itself, trying to optimize themselves for the challenges they will face and focusing only on what will bring success. The pressure for students to gear themselves for lucrative fields such as the technology and finance industries is a clear example of this mentality.
Of course, life often doesn’t go according to plan; circumstances are largely outside of any one person’s control. No amount of resume building can save you from an interviewer in a foul-mood, no amount of practice can prevent the career ending injury, and no amount of holding, consoling, or pleading will get your young son to stop shrieking in agony and pain in the wee hours of the morning in a hospital room. When confronted with that observation—that inescapable sense of lacking control—it’s understandable that we seek some escape from the feeling of powerlessness. So we toil along, following the “right” or “optimal” strategy as best as we can and hoping for some validation that our actions will have some eventual impact.
The original ending for TDC that the Greens had devised would have reminded the player how the struggle of life ends: The player would fiddle with an array of levers in an attempt to unlock the game’s final chapter, only to discover that the console’s “wires [were] frayed and disconnected. The levers were false, the game’s designer was in charge, and you were forced to acknowledge that you were powerless to control the outcome.” Interestingly, Joel’s death during TDC’s development persuaded the Greens to change this bleak outcome and rewrite most of the game, trading scenes emphasizing Amy and Ryan’s experience for scenes focusing on playing with and caring for Joel himself. Rather than despairing at what they—and, by extension what we—ultimately couldn’t control, Ryan and Amy chose instead to focus on enjoying the moments when control was irrelevant.
As a result, TDC offers a powerful counter to both the desire to optimize and the despair associated with the futility of optimization; it offers a pause from the ambition and angst of our lives. In the game’s final chapter, there is the opportunity to blow bubbles with Joel for an indefinite period of time in the afterlife, mirroring the opening in which you spend time with him at the playground. While I rushed through the first chapter to get to the story more quickly, after experiencing the game’s emotional rollercoaster, that last chapter stands as one of the most cathartic experiences I’ve had while gaming.
Like life itself, "That Dragon, Cancer" pushes you along a particular path—one where you might lack control, where you might feel hopeless, where you might come face to face with the worst of fate. However, it also invites you to stop, linger, and enjoy the moments and experiences you have before continuing on. Although pausing on that path might not directly help you “win,” it grants a tranquil happiness that provides a brief respite, and that can be immensely rewarding at its best. We all could do with heeding the invitation to stop, reflect, and blow some bubbles as we try to play this game we call life.

On February 8, three congressional Republicans sent an open letter to 56 universities with endowments over $1 billion to solicit information as to how these universities use their endowment funds. One of the congressmen, Thomas W. Reed II, has also proposed legislation that would force those universities to put at least 25 percent of their endowment income towards providing financial aid in order to keep their tax-exempt statuses.
This proposal is fundamentally misguided. Congress has no basis for understanding the needs of Harvard and other universities, or the intricacies of their budgets. For this reason, the University has repeatedly stated its opposition to the legislation.
It is true that Harvard could do more on financial aid. As we have argued in the past, Harvard should expand benefits for undergraduates to ensure that they cover incidental costs like textbooks and printing for students from low-income backgrounds.
Nevertheless, the broader implication of the proposed legislation is that institutions like Harvard cannot be trusted to manage their own endowments effectively. While we are concerned that Harvard’s financial aid programs might not match its rising tuition, we find the prospect of government interventions to be even more troubling. Washington has no business telling Harvard how to raise or spend its money.
Among those who look warily on the ever-increasing size of university endowments, two positions have emerged. One view, represented by Congressman Reed's bill, holds that Congress should act to keep the wealthiest universities from hoarding cash by creating financial aid requirements. The other posits that an excise tax on the largest endowments could redirect the funds to community colleges, which educate nearly half of all American undergraduates.
This latter effort is laudable, as community colleges need more funding. But it is not Congress’s job to redistribute funds between private and public universities. Making Harvard poorer will do little to change the systemic problems facing the American higher education system.
The proposed legislation also fails to take into account the differences in size between major universities’ endowments, as well as more relevant statistics such as endowment-per-student. A one-size-fits-all mandate would disadvantage universities with lower endowments. After all, siphoning off 25 percent of the income from Amherst College’s $2.1 billion endowment would have a larger impact than would the same policy for Harvard’s $37.6 billion endowment.
Ultimately, these attempts to meddle in the finances of private institutions is worrying.  Universities know better than Congress how to handle their endowments. We hope that recent legislative developments do not portend challenges in the future.

And on this, the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice in the human gift that is Missy Elliot.
It is a scene that I have played out in my mind a lot. Missy Elliot’s squad sits down with her at a meeting. Someone asks, “So, Missy Elliot, how do you want to make your comeback?”
“First of all,” Missy Elliot says, spinning around in her giant, winged-back, crushed velvet rolling chair, “Don’t call it a comeback.”
Her squad nods in unison, apologizing furiously, writing in their notepads.
“And second of all,” Missy Elliot continues, “I want to become a trap disco ball. Obviously.”
A brave member of the squad speaks up: “Say no more.”
If you haven’t seen the video for “WTF” by now—Missy Elliot’s latest—you have done bad and you should feel bad. What are you doing? Look at yourself. Look at your decisions.
What is it that makes a woman return to a music industry that does not deserve her a decade after a thoroughly lit career? What is it about “WTF” that flung me face first into my blackness, despite the weird Pharrell puppet interlude? What is it about Missy’s work that shook my blackness in 2005 when I was, like, literally 10 years old? What is it about the tracksuits? All the tracksuits?
It’s not just about the outfits. It never is. “WTF,” like most of Missy Elliot’s discography, is about her fierce conviction in centering the sexuality of black women in her music. If “Formation” taught us anything, it is that the media loves to debate whether black women are really feminists, putting their beliefs and politics on trial in a way that simply does not happen for male artists. When not completely denouncing a woman’s ideas, the media suggests that politicized women are simply posing. But a political project like Missy’s does not happen by accident.
In “WTF” alone, almost all of Missy’s lines that aren’t just hyping herself and her music up are about her body and her pleasure. She remarks that her “body be thick like a biscuit,” showcasing her body in its entirety, an adorned, painted, holy thing, in the music video.
She goes on: “I’m a Big Mac make you wanna eat that,” and she is plucking the trope of the woman’s body as a meal out of man’s mouth. Missy Elliot is celebrating herself and her people, the song explicitly mentioning its intended audience of “the hood” and “girls.”
Missy Elliot’s super popular 2002 “Work It” discusses the same under-appreciated politics, approaching consent, communication of wants and preferences within sexual acts, and the politics of body hair and one’s choice about it perhaps even more brazenly than in her latest: “Not on the bed, lay me on your sofa / Phone before you come, I need to shave my chocha / You do or you don’t or you will or won’t you / Go downtown and eat it like a vulture.”
Missy Elliot’s is the kind of self-love and self-care black people don’t get to celebrate enough. She’s haughty, certain. She is always curves but never “All About That Bass,” never traipsing onto territory that isn’t hers, never proselytizing or pandering to men. It’s not about what men want her to be, it’s about what she is and how that sometimes has something to do with men, sure. It is hardly a reclaiming, because it was hers all along, but it is revolutionary. It isn’t “wrap yourself up in a blanket and drink tea because you have no real responsibilities” self-care, it’s “let’s not even talk about what’s holding you down because what’s holding you up is those heels” going-out-and-getting-what-is-yours-because-you-have-to self-care.
Folks dance differently when Missy Elliot comes on, like trying to rattle around something the music has shaken loose in them. The first comment, last time I checked, on the rapgenius.com lyrics page for “WTF” is an awestruck “missy still got it.” And she does. She knows that. She always has.

UPDATED: February 24, 2016, at 12:20 a.m.
From dancing on tables to compiling Snapchat stories, residents of the 12 undergraduate Houses are busy producing and marketing their Housing Day videos.
On March 10, the about 1,660 members of the freshman class will receive their randomized House placements. Each year, upperclassmen put together creative videos, often parodies of popular songs, to generate excitement for the eagerly awaiting freshmen.

Students can expect videos to be released as early as this week, though most of them will become public a week to ten days before Housing Day. Starting as early as last semester, House Committees began formulating ideas for this year’s rendition of the annual tradition.
“The first thing to get settled is the theme for the year. The real challenge is to find a theme that not only fits with the House, but one that comes from the House itself,” said Brittany L. Wang ’17, co-chair of the Quincy House Committee.
Before releasing the videos, the teams often drop hints to create enthusiasm and to claim a theme before another house does. Two weeks ago, Eliot House released a poster of the cover for the single, “Sorry” by Justin Bieber, with the words “It’s ours.” A teaser video released by Dunster House called “Dunster Wars” imitated the fashion of a Star Wars movie’s introduction.
House Committees held sessions in their open meetings where residents could pitch ideas for the video. Committee chairs noted the importance of collaboration in the video making process.
“The best resources are people, so the more people we can get involved, the better for the community and for the video in the end,” Larissa M. Rocha ’17, co-chair of the Eliot House Committee, said.
Collaboration is key for Quincy’s video this year, which is taking an unconventional approach to getting footage for the final product.
“We’re relying on a lot of Snapchat submissions from members of the house, because our theme is actually DJ Khaled’s Snapchat story,” Louis J. Colson ’18, a member of the video production team, said.
Beyond entertainment, the Housing Day videos also seek to inform undergraduates, especially freshmen, about the features of each house.
“I think the House video does a good job of highlighting what we as House members want to show the freshman and want to show the public,” Wang said. “So that includes our traditions, our House masters, who they are, and just certain things that we think are special to us.”

More than 4,000 years ago, Queen Hetepheres of Egypt was buried alongside treasures next to the Great Pyramid at Giza. Today, Harvard researchers have brought a key treasure of her tomb to life: the Queen’s very throne.
The Harvard Semitic Museum opened a new exhibit last Thursday showcasing a recreation of a chair that a Harvard-led team found in a hidden chamber next to the Great Pyramid of Giza in 1925.
The recreation process took place under the Giza Project, started by Egyptology professor Peter Der Manuelian ’81, Harvard’s first egyptologist since George A. Reisner’s death in 1942.
The exhibit’s materials are based on finds uncovered during an archaeological project led by Reisner in the 1920s.  Managed jointly by Harvard and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Reisner’s team accidently discovered a hidden chamber next to the Great Pyramid, considered one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
The chamber served as burial place for Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu’s mother Queen Hetepheres. Khufu commissioned the Great Pyramid to be his own tomb in the 26th century BC.
“It’s in that chamber that the expedition team found in 1925 a little alabaster sarcophagus and a ton of deteriorated materials—pieces of furniture, gold, stone vessels, pottery, jewelry, razors, and all kinds of things,” Der Manuelian said.
The recreation process for Hetepheres’ throne required an interdisciplinary approach, utilizing 3D technology as well as artists from the Ceramics Program in the Office for the Arts. Kathy King, the program’s director, said the team faced difficulties in creating the authentic color and thinness of the tiles.
“We were trying to imagine how 100 Egyptian workers were able to do this thousands of years ago,” King said.
The Giza Project aims to archive all archaeological materials from the famed Egyptian site, including those from Reisner’s dig roughly 90 years ago. Der Manuelian first organized the project while working at the MFA before bringing it to Harvard.
The project is now focused on creating a 3D visualization of the Giza archaeological site, including the recreation of the throne now on display. This process inspired the team to recreate the the throne now on display.
“We thought, now that we’ve rebuilt the tomb and created virtual 3D objects out of all of these furniture pieces, that why not move back into the physical world for a change and try a full size fabrication of the chair based on the archaeological records of 1925 to 1927?” Der Manuelian said. “So that’s what we did.”
The MFA and the Cairo Museum in Egypt both have recreated sets of the objects in the Hetepheres’ tomb, but neither has before attempted to recreate her throne. Until now, the throne was considered too intricate and elaborate to be recreated accurately, Der Manuelian said.
The recreated throne will remain on display indefinitely at the Semitic Museum.

Over the past two weeks, more than 1,000 graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, and staff have been targeted in a phishing email scam that aims to compromise personal data.
On Feb. 12, unidentified attackers posing as Harvard representatives began sending out emails asking recipients to update their account information by clicking on an included link, according to Christian Hamer, Harvard’s Chief Information Security Officer. The link led to a fake login screen requesting the user's HarvardKey or PIN.
“At this time, we know that only a handful of people provided their credentials,” Hamer wrote in an emailed statement.
The attackers were able to use account information garnered from a few users to gain access to PeopleSoft, Harvard’s human resources system, according to Hamer. Once inside PeopleSoft, the scam’s perpetrators could attempt to view targeted individuals’ W-2 forms, if existent.
W-2s, federal tax forms provided to Harvard employees each year, report an individual’s income, taxes withheld, and Social Security Number, among other information.
“We believe the intended goal of accessing W-2s was to file fraudulent income tax returns to obtain tax refunds,” Hamer wrote.
Harvard Information Security first became aware of the scam on Feb. 14 and took immediate action. HIS staff blocked the attackers’ access to the University’s network, locked the Harvard accounts of individuals who had responded to the phishing campaign, and took down the fake Harvard login page, according to Hamer.
On Monday, Hamer sent an email to all students, faculty, and staff warning of the phishing attack, offering an example of the phishing email, and detailing what steps email recipients should now take. Information Security is continuing to contact individuals whose W-2s were accessed by the attackers, according to Hammer.
Scams and technology  attacks one are far from new to campus. In 2006, University social organizations were the targets of a fundraising scam. Last June, a security breach to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and central administration information technology networks may have compromised individuals’ email login credentials. More recently, two Harvard freshmen said they were scammed out of more than $1,500 in a phone scam a little over a month ago.
In light of the recent phishing attempt, Hamer urged all Harvard affiliates to remain vigilant.
“Phishing is one of the most common scams on the Internet,” Hamer wrote. “We discover phishing campaigns with varying targets daily. We all need to be alert for phishing emails every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
E.J. Dionne, a Washington Post op-ed columnist and political commentator, argued that a recent history of unfulfilled promises has alienated modern and liberal voters from the GOP.
Dionne, speaking to a few dozen people at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday, focused the discussion on his new newly published book, "Why the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism–From Goldwater to the Tea Party and Beyond." The book traces a gradual shift away from moderate conservatism, which Dionne attributes to a changing viewpoint following Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign.
“I believe the Goldwater campaign… [is] one of the genuinely important events of the last century, because that campaign fundamentally altered the nature of the Republican party. It set the party’s politicians up to make a series of promises they couldn’t keep,” he said.
Referencing the 2016 Presidential election, Dionne said the practice of making unrealistic promises has resurfaced among Republican presidential candidates. Dionne charged that Donald J. Trump, for instance, has expressed interest in reversing the effects of the 1965 Immigration Act and returning the ethnic makeup of the United States back to that of the 1940s and 1950s.
Dionne said many Republicans have felt betrayed and disappointed by their party’s rhetoric and leadership even since the 1930s. Reducing the size of federal government has been a common strategy of Republican rhetoric, despite difficulty in practice, he added.
“Government was exactly the same size as the share of GDP when Ronald Reagan left office as when Ronald Reagan took office,” Dionne said. “Americans can be quite critical of government in the abstract, but in the end, they want a great deal from government.”
Dionne also argued that broken promises have caused moderate and liberal voters to increasingly retreat from the ranks of the GOP, moving the “center of gravity” of the party from the Northeast to the South.
Thomas E. Patterson, Professor of Government and the Press at the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center, moderated the discussion that followed. He said he found Dionne’s ideas to be particularly “engaging,” especially Dionne’s arguments on the purported alienation of liberal and moderate voters from the Republican Party.
Anne Bernays, writing instructor and novelist at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, said she was “listening for something that she disagreed with,” but could not find anything that she did not concur with Dionne on.

Following a rigorous application process, 20 Harvard seniors will make up the inaugural class of the Harvard Teachers Fellows program.
Centered at the Graduate School of Education, the program was created to provide pathways into the education field for undergraduates interested in teaching. Since January, fellows have been participating in field-based training comprised of coursework and mentored teaching that will continue for eight months.
According to Stephen R. Mahoney, the program’s associate director, 27 of 32 students who submitted complete applications were offered positions in the first cohort. The application process included group and individual interviews, during which applicants were required to propose solutions to teaching dilemmas and demonstrate expertise in their subject area and commitment to educating youth.
“Teaching has to be a collaborative effort—it has to be transparent and shared,” Mahoney said. “We wanted to make sure we were bringing on young men and women who could listen to other people, take in different perspectives and respond to it in a proactive fashion.”
After completing the first round of training in August, students will train part-time in various public school districts and charter school networks for one academic year while continuing to be mentored by GSE faculty members. The program will culminate the following summer with additional mentorship and coursework upon which students will earn an initial teaching license.
Rebecca V. Park ’16, a History and Literature concentrator, said she felt fortunate and excited to have been selected.  She said she appreciates the extended training that the program provides in comparison to other introductory teaching programs, as well as its commitment to education over the longer-term.
“I wanted to do this program because I feel like it’s really respecting to teaching and teachers… giving me the tools to be as prepared as I can be on day one,” she said.
Teacher fellow Grace A. Kossia ’16, a Mechanical Engineering concentrator, said she wants to become involved in education over the long-term, potentially in science, and the program provides the necessary preparation to enter the teaching profession.
She said that in addition to the long-term transition into teaching that the program provides, the diversity of the participants has added to her experience.
“Something that’s been really powerful in this program is hearing other people’s experiences and how that relates to their education; how that we can use that diversity of experience…to prepare us as we go into these schools that are serving a diverse group of students,” Kossia said.
The Teachers Fellows program allows Harvard to join many other schools in offering students an alternative preparatory program to organizations like Teach for America, which some student groups have criticized for not preparing students adequately to teach in a classroom.

Danielle S. Allen, a Government professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, called on Americans across the political spectrum to organize against businessman Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign in a Sunday op-ed that has generated widespread reaction.
Allen said she found the need to write the op-ed for The Washington Post after Trump’s victory in Saturday’s Republican primary in South Carolina. Describing the primary as a “turning point,” Allen wrote in the piece that voters should recognize that there is not much time left to change the outcome of the Republican presidential nomination contest.
In the op-ed, which now has over 5000 online comments, Allen examined the dangers she perceived in Trump’s rise to political prominence, which she believes is a product of growing divisions in the United States. Instead of choosing not to challenge Trump, Americans must support “coordination across party lines and across divisions within parties,” Allen wrote.
“We, the people, need to find somewhere, buried in the recesses of our fading memories, the capacity to make common cause against this formidable threat to our equally shared liberties,” she wrote. “The time is now.”
Allen said she has received a wide range of opinions in response to her article, from the candidate’s supporters as well as his critics.
She wrote in her piece that Trump’s popularity has allowed her to understand how Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler was able to take control of Germany in the early 1930s. In an interview, Allen said she is not focused on exploring the direct comparison between Hitler and Trump, a point she also made in her op-ed.
“The fact that particular historical moments can teach us things that help us understand different moments doesn’t mean that there is a straight comparison between them,” she said. “The thing that requires comparison is the question of when and how do demagogues acquire power.  That’s what is the relevant comparison.”
History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a specialist in German history and former Crimson editorial chair, said the underlying question in Allen’s op-ed was over whether divisions in the United States today mirror those of the Weimar Republic, the democratic German state that preceded the Nazi regime.
While Maier said he does not believe the comparison is accurate, he said the rhetoric Trump uses is pervasive in Western politics.
“There are candidates who appeal to this sort of populism, anti-foreign impulse of feeling that their governments are too remote and don’t care about them,” he said.  “That is a widespread feeling throughout western Europe and the United States, and I think in that sense it produces ugly responses that stigmatize foreigners.”

By the end of this week, the House master title will likely be no more.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith will reveal the new title at Wednesday’s House master meeting, according to Mather House co-Master Michael D. Rosengarten. According to Lowell House co-Master Diana L. Eck, the new name may be revealed before the end of this week.
 In an interview last Friday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said Smith would make the final decision.
In December, the College’s 24 House masters, who collectively lead the upperclassmen residential halls, unanimously agreed to change their title. In the context of recent protests against racism at universities across the nation, and debate over the place of controversial historic names on campuses, the title has been criticized by students and Harvard affiliates as gendered and associated with slavery.
Specifics of the meeting and potential replacement names put forth by House masters in previous discussions have not been made public. FAS Spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon, and College Spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the record.
“Of note, from my point of view there are two parts to this, the dropping of the 'Master' title and the selection of a new title in keeping with the 21st century,” Rosengarten wrote in an email. “Both are important but the first part may be the most important.”
The impending change comes months after the initial announcement, followed by slow progress on finding a replacement title.
“The recommendation to change the title has been a thoughtful one, rooted in a broad effort to ensure that the College’s rhetoric, expectations, and practices around our historically unique roles reflects and serves the 21st century needs of residential student life,” Khurana told faculty members at a meeting in December.
University President Drew G. Faust has also voiced her support for the name change.
Harvard’s peer institutions are also grappling with their iteration of the title.  Last month, MIT house masters also unanimously voted to request to change their title of “Housemaster.” According to John M. Essigmann, one of MIT’s more than 25 housemasters, House administrators have settled on two potential alternatives: House Dean and Head of House.

Maria Thomas, interim CEO of the startup Glamsquad, recounted the ups and downs of her varied career during a talk at the Harvard Innovation Lab on Tuesday evening. 

Thomas inaugurated The Other Side, a new speaker series organized by the i-Lab that invites entrepreneurs from across the globe to share not just their success stories, but also “the failures and everything in between,” according to Jodi Goldstein, managing director of the i-Lab.
“We hope to bring in a number of different innovators over the course of the next couple of months to share the other side of their journey,” Goldstein said. “The path to innovation is never straight.”
The new series aims to bring in a “thoughtful and inspirational” element, allowing participants to learn from real-life examples, according to Goldstein. Most of the i-Lab’s previous events were focused on the practical aspect of entrepreneurship.
During the event, Thomas spoke about her experience of working in a variety of industries, ranging from financial institutions on Wall Street to governmental entities in Washington D. C. Since she entered the e-commerce industry several years ago, Thomas has focused on guiding companies through the early stages of their growth or transition into new business platforms, such as SmartThings and Etsy.
Thomas also recalled several setbacks that she encountered during her career. One such speedbump came as she was working with the founders of Etsy, an e-commerce website that focuses on handmade and vintage items, as the company’s chief executive.
“I experienced a lot of problems with the founders as the first non-founder CEO of Etsy,” Thomas said.
If she could relive her experience at Etsy, she said, she would do things differently.
“You have to get in and lead and trust your instincts. You can’t be deferential,” Thomas said. “And this is a major problem as a non-founder CEO.”
At the end of the event, Thomas shared the lessons she learned from her successes and failures, and offered advice to students interested in entrepreneurship.
“Be deliberate and thoughtful about the culture you want to create,” she said. “Have clear and repetitive communication about the things that matter, and use data and metrics to identify your strengths.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a time when students in Longwood have called for increased diversity on their campuses, Michelle A. Williams was named dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, becoming the first black dean of a Harvard faculty and the first woman to lead the school.
 The appointment comes as students at Harvard Medical School, the School of Public Health’s Boston neighbor, have requested University President Drew G. Faust and a Medical School dean search committee to focus on selecting a new leader who will emphasize increasing diversity on campus. They also asked that at least a quarter of interviewed candidates for the position “come from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine.”
Earlier in February, Medical School students delivered a petition to Massachusetts Hall expressing their demands, though Faust was not in her office at the time.
Students at the School of Public Health said Williams’s appointment is a positive step forward for Harvard as a whole and represents the University's commitment to diversity.
“Representation matters,” Olivia R. Orta, secretary of the Black Student Health Organization at the School of Public Health, said. “[Williams] brings with her many years of experience and a unique point of view.”
Blake E. Johnson, president of the School of Public Health’s Queer Student Association, said he hopes Williams’s appointment will draw more faculty and students of color to the campus.
“We are in serious need of more tenured female faculty, as well as faculty who are persons of color,” Johnson said. “My hope [is] that the hiring of Michelle Williams does not end the commitment of the President's Office to increase the diversity within the faculty and administration at Harvard.”
Andrea S. Christopher, a student in the School of Public Health, said Williams’s appointment signified an important step towards equality in the sphere of public health.
“As a minority woman planning to pursue a career in academia myself, I am excited to see Dr. Williams has earned the position of dean,” Christopher said.
Williams is currently an epidemiologist and professor at the school, focusing on infant and maternal health. In July, she will take the reins from David J. Hunter, who has served as interim dean since Julio Frenk left the School of Public Health last year after six years as dean to become the president of the University of Miami. She will assume the position during Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, as the school allocates a record-setting $350 million gift from billionaire benefactor Gerald L. Chan.
Discussions surrounding campus diversity are not new. In December, the School of Public Health hosted a “Listening Session” to discuss “several topics affecting diversity and inclusion in the School community including, but not limited to: education and training, recruitment, transparency, and establishing an office for community engagement,” according to the school’s website.
The search for the Medical School dean is ongoing.

The renewal of Lowell House will be one of the “largest and most complex” building renovations in Harvard College history, with builders facing a unique set of challenges posed by the location, size, and sheer antiquity of the 86 year-old House.
Lowell will be the fifth House to undergo heavy construction as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, and comes after the completion of Quincy House’s Stone Hall and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall. Building on Lowell will commence after upcoming construction on Winthrop House concludes in 2017.
 Dunster House was the first Harvard House to undergo a complete renovation, but Lowell’s landlocked location will make construction on the site exceptionally difficult, Lowell House co-Master Diana L. Eck said.
Along with being wedged in the heart of Harvard Square, Lowell’s limited access to major roadways such as Massachusetts Avenue or Memorial Drive, means staging for construction will need to take place inside the House itself.
“All the equipment that has to be brought in has to come into the courtyards,” Eck said.
Further complicating construction are efforts to make the House—which like others on campus, has no elevators and many floors—fully handicap accessible.
The renovation, initially announced in spring 2015, will span from June 2017 to August 2019, lasting a year longer than previously anticipated. Before Winthrop’s announced plan, every House had taken less than one academic year to renovate.
During renovations, displaced Lowell residents will live in the Harvard Inn and a number of University-owned apartment buildings near Harvard Yard, according to Eck.
Eck emphasized that concrete plans to remodel the House are still being discussed with KieranTimberlake, the same architectural firm that designed Dunster’s renovation, and said renovations will proceed quickly despite the elongated timeline.
“My sense is that it’s still a big, big job,” Eck said. ‘I don’t think it will be a relaxed pace.”
The sheer size of the Lowell renovation is to blame for its length and complexity, according to Zachary M. Gingo, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Senior Director for Facilities Operations.
“Lowell is different than Stone Hall and McKinlock in the same way that Dunster was, but it’s bigger than Dunster,” Gingo said.
Gingo added that he and his office are responsible for overseeing Lowell’s maintenance after renovations occur, but are not involved directly in plans for renovation.
“I don't know what renovated Lowell will look like yet, but my guess is that it will have a lot of improvements that I wish they'd taken into account when renovating Dunster as well, such as more suites or bigger living spaces,” said Dunster resident Stephanie G. Franklin ’16.
Students have previously criticized the lack of in-suite common rooms in several of the renewed Houses thus far.
The renovations to Lowell, one of the first two Houses established, will no doubt cost more than the original $3,620,000 construction price tag in 1930.
According to Eck, Lowell’s staff  is focusing on figuring out how to maintain House spirit during the swing housing period, a time she described as a “diaspora.”
Throughout the spring semester, Lowell House staff will solicit students’ opinions and feedback for the impending renovation.

Harvard’s central office for investigating cases of sexual harassment has heard 34 cases since it opened in September 2014 and started a pipeline program to hire more investigators amid increased demand.
Halfway through its second full year of operation, the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which investigates complaints of sexual harassment at every Harvard school except the Law School, has closed 21—or roughly two-thirds—of those cases, according to Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX Officer.
Roughly half of the cases have ended with a finding of a policy violation, according to Karvonides.
“When we do a full investigation it’s a pretty close mix in terms of violation and no violations for our outcomes,” Karvonides said last week.
Of the total caseload, 24 were filed by female complainants and five by male complainants. Title IX coordinators, meanwhile, opened four of the ODR cases. 
The majority of respondents in the cases were male; only four respondents were female. Seven parties in the cases—either a complainant or respondent—identify as BGLTQ, according to Karvonides.
Sixteen of the cases involved allegations of sexual assault, with 11 of those cases including allegations of penetration. Eighteen of the total cases involved allegations of conduct that was not sexual assault, and 13 of the cases involved people in “a dating or close friendship,” according to Karvonides.
The latest batch of statistics from ODR reflects an increase in the number of formal complaints filed since the office opened. As of October, the office had opened between 25 and 30 cases. Complainants and respondents came from 11 of Harvard’s schools, and four cases included a respondent and complainant from different schools.
Karvonides said students are also disclosing potential cases of sexual harassment at a higher rate.
“We are continuing to see a greater number, an enormous increase in people coming forward disclosing,” Karvonides said.
She added that roughly half the workload of the Title IX Office and ODR—which ranges from conducting investigations, responding to disclosures, and coordinating prevention and education efforts—involves students and half involves faculty, staff, and other University affiliates. To handle the increasing workload, Karvonides said she hopes to expand ODR’s staff. For months after it opened, ODR remained understaffed, and though it now boasts three full-time investigators, Karvonides said she hopes to begin “a pipeline program” to hire fellows who would eventually become investigators.
Karvonides said she has already hired a fellow who may eventually transition into an investigator role at ODR, and hopes to hire a second fellow in the near future.
“What we’re basically doing is developing a pipeline program because one of the real priorities for me is to increase diversity in my office,” Karvonides said. “There’s so few people out there—I mean we did a national search using a search firm to find investigators, and there were so few people that had the qualifications and the competencies that we were looking for that what we have shifted to is a pipeline approach.”
ODR’s larger caseload comes as attention to sexual harassment and assault at Harvard surges. Last fall, a University-wide sexual conduct survey revealed that 31 percent of senior women at the College had experienced some kind of sexual misconduct during their time as undergraduates, results some administrators described as “troubling.”
The survey also revealed that a majority of Harvard undergraduates did not trust Harvard and were not knowledgeable about how the University responds to and investigates sexual harassment.
In the aftermath of the survey, students held a rally and petitioned administrators. 
Last week, a recent  graduate filed a lawsuit arguing that Harvard violated anti-sex discrimination law Title IX and failed to properly respond to her sexual harassment case when she was student living in Cabot House. The suit, filed in Massachusetts District Court, charts a complaint Alyssa R. Leader ’15 said she filed with ODR after a male College student purportedly sexually abused and intimidated her.
The College, meanwhile, remains the subject of a federal investigation into its Title IX compliance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A night game at home against Dartmouth might just come back to haunt the Harvard women’s basketball team. The contest—a 70-64 loss to the Big Green—saw the Crimson shoot 32 percent from the field and 18 percent from beyond the arc.
Four weeks later, the Harvard squad that lost that home against Dartmouth only a week after taking down the Big Green in Hanover is nearly unrecognizable. A close win against Cornell on Saturday puts Harvard in contention with Ivy League heavyweights Penn and Princeton, but barring the two lose to the teams they’ve trounced earlier this season, the road to an Ivy League title looks near impossible.
With Penn undefeated and Princeton hot on their trail with only a single loss, even a perfect finish to the season by the Crimson likely wouldn’t be enough to take the Ivy League. Barring a miracle win by the likes of Dartmouth or Cornell against Princeton and Penn, it seems as if the Killer P’s are en route to their seventh Ivy League title—yes, Princeton and Penn are the only two schools to win the Ivy League in the past six years.
By no means, however, has the season been a disappointment for the Crimson. At 7-3, Harvard’s season has seen the largest comeback in program history along with an overtime loss against a Princeton squad that started the season ranked and went 30-0 in the regular season just a year ago.
For the Crimson, the season didn’t start quite as expected. After a series of tough non-conference matchups that saw the Harvard drop five in a row at one point, it seemed the departure of the Crimson’s two main scorers—Temi Fagbenle and Erin McDonnell—had left Harvard without an offense. With a starting rotation of three seniors and two freshman guards, it seemed as if the Crimson’s offense more or less relied on one of the Crimson’s three seniors putting up more than 20 on a given night.
The Crimson seemed hit a new low against Stony Brook early in January when a late whistle sent the Seawolves to the line with three seconds on the clock. Freshman guard Davion Wingate missed the first, but swished the second to send Harvard home with their fifth loss in a row.
For the Crimson, the old adage that says you can’t win unless you learn to lose apparently holds true. Since that January loss Harvard has lost only four contests, with three of these decided by single digits.
As it stands, co-captain AnnMarie Healy is the second leading scorer in the Ivy League and holds the fourth best field goal percentage. Co-captain Kit Metoyer and classmate Shilpa Tummala are first and second among the league in average three-pointers made.
Despite the bleak odds at an Ivy League title, the second half of Harvard’s season has been nothing short of spectacular. After surviving overtime against Cornell and a late run from Columbia in New York it’s become obvious coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s team isn’t one to throw in the towel, especially when it comes to the conference games and perhaps even more so when it’s late in the game.
To illustrate my point I’ll simply say this—six of the Crimson’s ten Ivy League games have been decided in the last three minutes of play or overtime.
When it comes down to it, Harvard is only a late bucket against Dartmouth and an overtime win against Princeton shy of a 9-1 record. It might almost be unfair, but that’s at the end of the day that’s the Ivy League.
It might seem like Delaney-Smith’s squad is timelessly stuck in a battle for silver or bronze in the Ivy League—in the past seven seasons Harvard has never finished below third in the Ivy League, but it has also never won the Ivy League title outright. Discounting aforementioned miracles it looks like the streak will hold for 8 years now—but even there’s plenty of room for hope in Delaney-Smith’s locker room.
With a rotation of three freshman guards that regularly play over 20 minutes and promising play from sophomore Kirby Porter and Junior Destiny Nunley, the Crimson has the pieces in place to compete for the next few years.
Among the big three—in this case Harvard, Princeton, and Penn—Delaney-Smith is the only coach to regularly start and rotate in freshman. The trio of Nani Redford, Madeline Raster, and Sydney Skinner is averaging 14.8 points, 10 rebounds, and 5.6 assists a game. By themselves these statistics might not seem impressive, but when you think about the fact that no Penn freshman averages more than eight minutes a game or the fact that all of Princeton’s four leading scorers are graduating come May, it seems as if Delaney-Smith’s team might just be on the brink of something good.
So yes, that January 23 loss against an up-and-coming Dartmouth squad might simply be another chapter in the history of a Harvard team unable to get over the hump for a few years. The future looks bright, however, and even as it stands there’s still plenty of basketball left to be played. Who knows, maybe miracles do happen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its season-opener against Villanova on Saturday, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (2-0, 0-0 Ivy League) called on its defense at the end of the game to preserve a 12-12 tie and force overtime. The defense answered the call, and the Crimson pulled out a 13-12 win.
On Tuesday against Holy Cross (0-3, 0-0 Patriot League) at home, it was the offense’s turn to come through as time winded down. After Crusaders junior attacker Jon Vogel found the back of the net with 45 seconds remaining in the game to put his team up 10-9, Harvard won the faceoff and called timeout to set up for one final attack.
Just seven seconds after the pause in play, sophomore midfielder Sean Coleman sent a centering pass to classmate Morgan Cheek, the attackman who scored the game-winner over the weekend. Cheek once again delivered for the Crimson, firing a shot past Holy Cross senior goalie Michael Ortlieb with 17 seconds left in regular time, sending the game into overtime.
Harvard had trailed 6-0 at one point in the first quarter, 7-2 at halftime, and 8-4 at the start of the fourth quarter. Yet by the time the full 60 minutes had passed, Harvard had climbed back into the game, and the two teams were back at square one, with 10 goals apiece. Sudden death overtime.
The first extra period ended without a score as the pressure forced the squads into a combined five turnovers. After the Crimson stopped the Crusaders in their first possession of the second overtime, however, senior midfielder Brendan Newman finally broke the deadlock.
With Newman’s goal, Harvard tallied its second consecutive overtime win. The last time the team had two such wins in a season was in 2002, but it has already managed to match the feat in the first two games of 2016. Meanwhile, Holy Cross, despite its valiant effort, drops to 0-33 all time against the Crimson.
“We’ve got a lot to work on,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “It was very lucky we didn’t have to learn our lesson the hard way tonight, but no one is pleased with the way we started the game.”
Crusaders coach Judd Lattimore will be lamenting just the opposite, as his squad dominated play over the first three quarters. After scoring only eight goals in each of its first two games, Holy Cross exploded for six in the first quarter alone on Tuesday.
Senior attacker Sean Wilkinson led the charge, scoring two goals and creating problems for the Crimson with his speed and deceptive movements. Sophomore attacker Logan LeBlond also added two tallies for the Crusaders in a quarter in which they outshot Harvard 12-2.
“I was very disappointed with how flat we were in the first half,” Wojcik said. “We were slow on ground balls and credit to Holy Cross for taking advantage of that. They came out strong and we just didn’t have a response.”
Faceoff violations also hurt the Crimson early in the game, as it picked up two quick violations in the first seven minutes, and had to play more conservatively at the faceoff X for the rest of the half. This threat of picking up a penalty allowed the Crusaders to go 8-11 at the X and control possession throughout the first two quarters.
Harvard finally began to show signs of life in the second and third quarters, picking up their intensity on defense. The team could only muster four goals on the other end, however, and still found itself trailing 8-4 heading into the final period.
“Coach told us at halftime that it was unacceptable to be outhustled by them like we were, let alone at home” Crimson co-captain Sean Mahon said. “The guys definitely started to play harder after that, and luckily, it showed on the scoreboard.”
Devin Dwyer, a senior attackman for Harvard, was integral to the turnaround, as he scored in each of the last three quarters. He paced the team with two goals and an assist in the fourth quarter as the Crimson clawed back into the game. Dwyer finished with four goals and three assists, including one on the game-winner to Brendan Newman.
“Devin was there for us throughout the game, but everyone else including me needed to step up,” Mahon said. “Now, it’s up to looking at the game film and making sure we come out more prepared next game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the first NBA trade ever to feature only Harvard graduates, the D-League’s Westchester Knicks traded Wesley Saunders ’15 to the Austin Spurs Tuesday night for Keith Wright ’12. Saunders had been averaging just 4.4 points in 18 minutes a game for the Knicks, while Wright was mired at the end of the bench in Texas, getting just under nine minutes a game of playing time.
A couple of Saunders’ new teammates are his old college foes. Nick Johnson (Arizona), Keifer Sykes (Green Bay), and Cady Lalanne (UMass) all lined up against Saunders at some point in his college career, with the Harvard star going 2-2 against the trio. A bit bigger than both Sykes and Johnson, Saunders, whom Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called the team’s best player during each of his last three years in Cambridge, should move into a backup shooting guard role for the Spurs.
Wright, like Saunders a former Ivy League Player of the Year, will also have additional opportunities for his new team. He immediately becomes the third-biggest player on the Westchester roster, tied with Damien Inglis behind Jordan Crawford and Gani Lawal. His lackluster performance this year (35.5 percent shooting versus 51.7 percent career) may change with a move back to the Northeast.

Some Houses have already released previews of their 2016 Housing Day videos, but we are not yet convinced that the Dark Side (or long and drawn-out scrolling lines of text fading into the vast expanse of outer space) looks good on Dunster, or that Eliot really needs to apologize for anything (or maybe it should – see below). For HoCos that have not started making their videos yet, here are some recommendations based on an appraisal of your House character.
Adams: FourFiveSeconds (Rihanna, Kanye West, and Paul McCartney)
This song is fitting for two reasons. First, we get it, Adams. It actually takes only four or five seconds to get from class to your front door. But on the other hand, that is also how long it takes for you to find a cockroach or furry roommate. Everything comes with a tradeoff.
Cabot: Hello (Adele) 
Hello from the other side. Of campus. Of the world, it sometimes seems. Hello from across the Quad, because Cabot is not even completely connected. If you’re placed into Cabot, you’ll be wondering if after all the years it takes you to make it to the River for Sunday brunch, your friend will still like to meet to go over everything (on your problem set due the next day).
Currier: Can’t Feel My Face (The Weeknd)
Yes, another Quad joke. Currierites are probably so cold by the time they finally get back home that they physically cannot feel their face, with or without that special someone.
Dunster: Wildest Dreams (Taylor Swift)
The Dunster renovation took the best of classical Harvard and the best of trying to live in the 21st century to satisfy living quarters that had previously been only in our wildest dreams. Here’s to hoping it satisfies all of yours, too.
Eliot: B!tch Better Have My Money (Rihanna) 
Rihanna earns a second spot on our list with a song that sounds like it could have been written by Eliot HoCo. Hope you’re ready to pony up if you get Eliot.
Kirkland: Hands To Myself (Selena Gomez)
Kirkland residents literally cannot keep their hands to themselves. Exhibit A: Incest Fest. Get ready to know your blockmates extra well if you get placed here.
Leverett: WTF - Where They From (Missy Elliott and Pharrell Williams)
“What? Leverett? Is that a House?” asks a perfectly innocent freshman. Yes, and YOU might live there next year. But don't worry, just because you aren’t really sure which of the brick buildings along the River is McKinlock doesn’t mean it won’t make a loving home for the next three years. Just watch out for man-eating rabbits in the courtyard and rabid physics p-setters in the dining hall.
Lowell: Hold My Hand (Jess Glynne)
When freshmen entering Lowell learn that they will be out of their House for their junior and senior years, endless hand holding and tear wiping will be in order. Rumor has it Diana and Dorothy are thinking of relocating Lowell Tea to El Jefe’s location for the interim, knowing that nothing in that space lasts too long anyway.
Mather: The Night Is Still Young (Nicki Minaj)
You will be using this line every weekend to make sure you take full advantage of your single. Just make sure you turn up your boom badoom-boom super bass so you don’t scar your neighbors with the wild mating call of your anaconda.
Pforzheimer: Where Are U Now (Jack U and Justin Bieber)
“Ugh, another Quad joke,” you’re probably thinking to yourself right now. Well, you’re right. There were not many good songs to choose from in 2015.
Quincy: When We Were Young (Adele)
Quincy seems to be all about the contrast between old and new. With the opening of Stone Hall in 2013, New Quincy became old and Old Quincy (formerly Increase Mather Hall) became new. Though Adele reflects on yesteryear, current freshman can look forward to not having the crazy Quincy dining restrictions imposed on them for the rest of their Harvard career. The future ain’t so bad after all.
Winthrop: Drag Me Down (One Direction)
2015 was the year that Winthrop dragged everything down... or maybe vice versa. As asbestos rains onto students from the walls and the ceilings, our fingers are crossed for the future of the House of Throp.

A few weeks ago, my fellow writer Nacho wrote a post lamenting the decline in the quality of HUDS meals compared to 1909, when they had broiled halibut and lamb chops for breakfast. To our surprise, what we thought was the official HUDS twitter retorted back at us with a lot of sass:

We at Flyby were pretty upset for a bit, that is until the actual HUDS twitter account (@HUDSinfo) informed us that they were the real deal, and @HarvardDining was in fact fake. What? There was someone out there pretending to be HUDS on Twitter? Why?
Unfortunately, perhaps as a result of our attempts to pull back the curtain and expose the mysteries of this HUDS parody, the account was recently suspended from Twitter. It left this cruel world too soon. It will be missed.
@HarvardDining was actually pretty funny. They started tweeting in March 2014 and at their demise had 37 followers, one of which was the actual HUDS twitter—keep a close eye on your enemies, maybe?
Sometimes, @HarvardDining liked to mix politics and Sunday Sundaes:

Other times, they liked to be very protective over their food:

They even started #twitterbeef with Pfoho:

But at the end of the day, we just want to know, @HarvardDining, who were you? And where did you go?
