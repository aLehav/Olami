A partnership between Spotify and Electric Lady Studios announced on July 13, 2021 has overseen the release of several EPs under the title “Live At Electric Lady.” These EPs are recordings of special live covers performed in New York’s legendary Electric Lady Studios—performances by the likes of Patti Smith, Jon Batiste, and Faye Webster. The latest EP is that of rising indie-rock star Japanese Breakfast, known offstage as Michelle Zauner. The release of Japanese Breakfast’s “Live At Electric Lady” EP is ushered in by the hype of her acclaimed album “Jubilee” and her New York Times-best-selling memoir “Crying in H Mart,” both of which came out earlier in 2021.
Zauner flourishes within the confines of Electric Lady Studios, utilizing the intimate setting and the talents of the exceptional resident sound engineers. In the live EP, the singularity of her voice reveals itself as it shines through lyrics about the cracks in different kinds of love.
The opening track, “Tactics - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios,” establishes wavering feelings that Zauner follows in many directions throughout the EP. Much like the original from “Jubilee,” the song begins with swelling violins. But these strings are different: louder, more convincing, and carried over in full thanks to the album’s sublime, hi-fi production. The same is true of Zauner’s own voice.
In the song, Zauner adapts experiences with her father into a broader storyline about toxic relationships. She aches to remember beautiful moments of a past love, perhaps just to assure herself that the love existed: “Tried, tried to recall, memories of peaches, the sun on my neck.” In following verses, she notes attempts at filling the space left behind, “without much discretion of who.” She holds that she must stay away from this person and not be persuaded by recitations of a fictional past. The one word in “Tactics” provides a silhouette of Zauner’s pain, which is then severely shaded by her haunting voice.
Three of the eight tracks on the EP were not originally released by Japanese Breakfast. “Lindsey,” off the breakout album of Zauner’s former band, Little Big League, is the first of them. Though not a standout track, “Lindsey - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios'' serves two purposes on the record. Firstly, it pays homage to her musical roots, and secondly, it plays on a theme common in her work, both on and off the EP: the way in which traditions of heteronoramtive, monogamous relationships are equated to love. In “Lindsey,” Zauner personifies someone who can only show their love through promises of provision and offspring; “I could win your bread if you let me,” and “I will have you longing for heirs.”
Nowhere on the album is this theme clearer than in “Savage Good Boy - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios,” a stripped-down version of a hit track off “Jubilee.” In it, Zauner’s lyrics are left to shine as she embodies an investment-banker type who believes, “That all my bad behavior was just a necessary strain.” Accompanied by a singular acoustic guitar, the absurd monologue of a man who wants only to make money and rear children feels earnest in a way that it couldn’t in the original.
The second non-Japanese Breakfast track on the EP, “Ballad 0 - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios,” is part of Zauner’s side project, “BUMPER.” It's a little-known song now given a new life. Zauner successfully trades out lo-fi vocal effects for elevated production to shed light on a hidden gem of songwriting; It’s less stylized, but more memorable — a heart-achey retelling of the difficulties of leaving a relationship you know you’ve outgrown.
The final song on the album is “Say It Ain’t So - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios,” a cover of Weezer's infamous hit. I don’t want to spoil it, but it does indeed fill its boots as a refreshed, vibrant rendition of a legendary track — a strong end to a tender album that will earn your attention and eventually, your heart.

Julian Lage, a self-proclaimed guitar nerd, can only be described as genius. A child prodigy who was the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary at age eight, Lage is one of those rare individuals who exhibits a complete union of human and instrument. His guitar appears to be an extension of his body, and in sync the two undergo a sonic exploration that is awesome to witness.
The energy of the Julian Lage Trio, which includes bassist Jorge Roeder and drummer Dave King, perfectly meshed with the hip wood-paneled walls of the Berklee Performance Center. The stage, surrounded in dark curtains, was reminiscent of a black-box theater — intimate yet simple enough that the trio stood out, spotlighted by smoothly shifting colors.
Sitting in the darkened hall, glazed in blue and orange lighting, one felt they were in the presence of one of the greats as Lage’s fingers flew across the fretboard of his custom Collings butter yellow guitar. The bowed heads of the other two members assured you that you were indeed witnessing the divine. To listen to the Julian Lage Trio live is a holy experience.
The set list included songs from a smattering of albums, including Lage’s 2021 release, “Squint,” and older albums like “Arclight” (2016) and “World’s Fair” (2015). “Squint” featured prominently, with songs performed including “Boo’s Blues,” “Saint Rose,” and “Quiet Like A Fuse.”
Lage recorded “Squint” during the pandemic. It was his debut album for the iconic Blue Note Records, a label which has produced the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, and Art Blakey.
Covid-19 delayed recording in the studio until August of 2020. During the delay, Lage’s album conception shifted from creating purely positive music into something that was more conversational, emotionally complex, and emblematic of the time he was living through — according to his website.
The live performance of the album, combined with the other older songs, produced moments of joy and intensity. The emotion and energy were furthered by Lage’s stage presence, making it hard to divorce Lage’s music from the visual performance of this show.
Lage did not stop moving: strutting flamingo-like across the stage during a particularly involved piece, oscillating between 45 and 90 degrees with a bend at the hip, bouncing up and down in childlike giddiness with a wide smile on his face as his guitar merged with the bedrock of rhythm and depth created by Roeder and King.
The trio shared a visible rapport as they played, so controlled yet at the same time liberated, through their careful intertwining of instruments. The three were constantly and perfectly in sync. The genuine love and respect they had for one another was evident in the almost intimate gazes shared by the musicians while on the stage.
When discussing what it felt like to jam with others as a guest on D’Addario and Co.’s show Guitar Power, Lage said, “I’m not guessing if it sounds good. If my foot’s tapping and theirs is too, and I feel kind of swept up in it all, it’s probably going okay.”
There certainly was foot tapping and head bobbing during Lage’s concert. The musicians occasionally punctuated their songs with laughter, and the energy shared between the three of them echoed into the audience. From time to time, a laugh, a sigh, or a free-formed “yeah!” broke the reverent silence.
Lage’s closing song, “Quiet Like A Fuse” from his most recent album “Squint,” was perhaps one of the best pieces of the night. The three musicians harmoniously clashed, high notes reeled into fresh air, and came together in a perfect moment before Lage took a solo. King had his head bent in prayer; Roeder stared towards the ceiling in a moment of transcendence as Lage carried the song.
Packing in musical influences, the piece toyed with blues and rock n’ roll, grounded by meaningful silence. The trio came together in one final moment, before the resonant notes of Lage’s guitar were left echoing into the hall.
And then, like it began, in an abrupt movement the musicians stepped away from their instruments, King threw a peace sign, Lage blew a kiss to the crowd, and they disappeared.
They reappeared for one last song, and after tumultuous applause, the crowd sat back down to be captivated one final time.

Squeezing homophobia, racism, sexism, grief, a flawed education system, a (non-COVID) pandemic, the navigation of relationships, and the exploration of sexuality into one book sounds like an impossible task. Somehow, Benjamin Alire Sáenz manages to touch upon all of these subjects in his latest novel, “Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World.” In doing so, he tastefully creates a multidimensional narrative worthy of every reader’s time.
The book picks up where its critically acclaimed prequel “Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe” left off. At the end of the first novel, teenager Aristotle Mendoza comes to terms with his sexuality and acknowledges his love for Dante Quintana. Now, in addition to the many pressures of being a high school student, Ari must navigate a queer relationship in a landscape that attempts to invalidate his very existence — late 1980s Texas.
Getting invested in this novel takes a bit of patience. The story is slow to start, with roughly one hundred pages of Ari engaging in mundane conversations and ruminating over repetitive thoughts. The pace accelerates, however, when Ari and Dante go on a camping trip together. Here, Sáenz settles into the flow of the narrative. Conversations grow deeper, reflecting the development and maturation of the young men. The language used to describe the forest landscape is beautifully playful and vivid. In the wilderness, Ari and Dante are able to love each other without fear of being seen. The moments they share are euphoric, sweet enough to make any reader smile.
One of Sáenz’ greatest accomplishments in this novel is capturing the frantic inner monologue of a high school student. Written in first person, the narrative gives readers access to Ari’s stream of consciousness, where emotions fluctuate from anger to insecurity, excitement to fear. His thoughts are vulnerable and relatable, allowing readers to forge a connection even if they don’t share his identity as a gay, Mexican-American man.
This intimate glimpse into Ari’s thoughts also brings this sequel into the realm of the sexual. As his relationship with Dante progresses beyond witty banter, cuddles, and kisses, Ari’s mind turns to sexual desires. This has two effects: First, it normalizes Ari as just another teenage boy. Despite feeling like an outcast, at the end of the day, Ari’s urges match those of his high school peers with raging hormones. Second, Sáenz shares a message that shame should not accompany sexual feelings. In the beginning of the novel, Ari is embarrassed whenever one of these thoughts arises. But soon enough, Ari realizes that those feelings are a natural extension of his love for Dante and that he should never be ashamed of them.
This novel could easily be a depressing tale about a young man facing relentless oppression as a member of multiple minority communities. Instead, Sáenz has written a heartwarming story that serves as a beacon of hope for anyone who struggles to find a sense of belonging. There are still moments of sorrow — Ari loses a close family member, watches as AIDS takes the lives of thousands, and faces the homophobia of a brother in prison for murdering a trans woman. Nevertheless, the joy outweighs the melancholy.
Much of the joy in this novel stems from acceptance. Readers of BGLTQ literature are accustomed to characters being rejected by friends and family after coming out. Ari and Dante’s parents, however, break this tradition by wholeheartedly accepting their sons’ sexuality. They treat each boy as one of their own, offer support when tensions arise in their relationship, and share a bounty of life lessons. Ari is also embraced by friends at school who create a safe environment in which he can discover his identity and his voice. Let this be a reminder of the power of open-mindedness. When the weight of the world feels like too much to bear, having just one person who offers support can make all the difference.
“Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World” features the fragility of life and love. There are moments when the bonds between Ari and his friends, lover, and parents feel unbreakable, and there are moments when these relationships are torn apart. By the end of the novel, readers are guaranteed to reach for their phones and call their loved ones.

In Nathalie Biancheri’s “Wolf,” animals and great acting are aplenty, while narrative consistency is nowhere to be found. The picture spends 98 minutes trying to make statements on topics as varied as technology, love, and the meaning of normality, but ultimately fails to say anything worthwhile.
“Wolf” follows Jacob (George MacKay), a young man who suffers from species dysphoria and believes himself to be a wolf. Confined by his parents to a mental health institution specializing in treating the condition, he and his fellow patients are subject to the Zookeeper’s (Paddy Considine) abusive treatments. During a full moon, he sneaks out of his room and meets Wildcat (Lily-Rose Depp), a fellow patient. The two soon develop feelings for each other that lead them to embrace their animal side.
To Biancheri’s credit, at no point does the film devolve into comedy despite its tricky subject matter. A fight at the beginning between characters introduced as Bear and Squirrel could turn into farce, but instead serves the purpose of establishing the ambivalence of the institution toward the well-being of its patients. The Parrot — constantly wearing an outlandish, fiery bird costume complete with a huge beak — is remembered not as the butt of a joke, but a character deeply traumatized after the Zookeeper dared her to fly out the window as a part of her therapy.
The film maintains a perpetually serious tone, revealing how the institution is a place of suffering and mental anguish — they are clearly dead set on results, with no regard for consequences. What the film seeks to achieve within that framing is less clear.
The film tries to engage in a profound conversation on the human experience. The Zookeeper, for example, believes that “technology reconnects us with our human side,” and that any measure used to reach what he views as normalcy is justified because humans are inherently “superior” to animals. His attempts fail, however, suggesting that what society and the medical authorities deem a mental illness might make for a valid and fulfilling alternative to modern life. But the narrative developments undermine the conclusion. Distinctly human romantic love, conversation, and intellectual ingenuity are framed as crucial to the protagonists’ eventual success and shown to be a source of their happiness.
An issue even graver is that Biancheri’s picture feels like a series of vaguely connected vignettes, with a very loose sense of narrative and temporal progression. Even the film’s most climactic moments between its two protagonists are characterized by few verbal exchanges or emotions that would ground them at a given point in the narrative. The characters’ continuous cycle of improvements and relapses make for what seems to be an accurate depiction of mental illness, but takes away the last opportunity to clearly establish the order of events through character growth — be it progress or regression. The result is a bizarrely indistinct yet perplexing and multifaceted story that, like a deck of cards or a Kafka novel, would make just as much sense if it were reshuffled.
The supporting performances only add to the confusion. It’s difficult to portray mental illness and erratic behaviors empathetically and convincingly. It’s even more difficult with employees of an asylum. Their job is full of interactions that seem unnatural and exaggerated. “Wolf” cannot surmount the challenges and simply misses the mark. The stiltedness of the portrayals of patients and especially the staff, more reminiscent of telemarketers or motivational speakers than real humans, breaks the immersion.
MacKay stands out, but his skill ultimately doesn’t lend itself enough toward narrative development. Granted, Jacob’s inspection of his face — the subtle touching of his nose, as if to make sure it’s real — conveys the peculiarity of the young man’s condition much more aptly than any conversation would. His struggle against the moonlight, the drawn out sequences of his stealthy movement on all fours, and the howling are brilliant and make for a convincing depiction. But even inspired portrayal becomes tedious. After half an hour, the film’s emphasis on body movements and facial expressions turns into little more than self-serving, if captivating, acting exercises without clear purpose.
“Wolf” can best be described as having no clear purpose. Self-contradictory and nonsensical, it could have been a mesmerizing short film. But as is, the picture offers 98 minutes of head-scratching accompanied by George MacKay’s fantastic, if largely futile, acting.

Nigerian-American rapper and songwriter Wale schooled the House of Blues on Jan. 25. His “Folarin II” tour boasts star-studded features and a new emphasis on a groovy R&B theme. The DC rhymer went back to basics focusing on his lyricism while highlighting the hot topics of modern rap in his verse. His versatile flow and lyrical range carried his set.
Wale took advantage of the nostalgia in performing older songs like “Diced Pineapples” and “The Need to Know.” The rapper ad-libbed to the ladies in the crowd during “Fire & Ice” while his collaborator and sideman, Tre, came out on stage to carry the vocals. Wale vibed with the audience through tracks like these, the stage lights fading out to reflect the intimacy of the moment. The rapper two-stepped across the stage with the groove each track demanded.
The rapper’s dedication to self-improvement was evident throughout the concert. Although he has been a respected and recognized industry artist for over a decade, the passion did not wane in this performance. Wale worked up a sweat, meticulously delivering each line and taking no breaks despite his strained voice. He even directed his DJ to keep it going on tracks like the upbeat bop “Poke It Out” and to cut it down for the acapella verse in “Down South.” As the setlist started to heat up, the 37-year-old rapper took off his jacket to reveal a “Folarin II” branded shirt that matched perfectly with the themed backgrounds: strippers and sweets for “Poledancer” and “Caramel,” recording studios and cassettes for “Ambition,” and the white backdrop of a wedding dress on “The Matrimony.”
Wale ebbed and flowed through the setlist with the addition of songs like “Sue Me” and “Tiffany Nikes.” The sobering social commentary in his lyrics had the audience raising fists of protest as he rapped, “The whip is bullet repellent / But they gon' kill me with tax.” Interweaving discussions of chart manipulation and the toll of the pandemic was easy in a context like this, where his music and society intertwine.
The concert wound down with the crowd favorites “My PYT,” “On Chill,” and “Bad.” He got the audience chanting his name while his opening act, Guapdad 4000, returned to the stage to hype him up. Guapdad had aced his own performance before Wale took the stage, and the rappers had a hear-to-heart about their mutual respect and willingness to keep enjoying future concerts like this one. The night ended in a high energy performance of “No Hands” that shook the building.
While Wale was definitely feeling himself during hype songs like “Name Ring Bell,” it was clear that the rapper remains focused on his future. After a heartfelt message about his difficulties with marriage, he FaceTimed his daughter in the middle of the concert to put a smile on her face. His candid interludes between songs affirmed that Wale was not doing this for fame, money, or recognition, but for self-improvement. Being able to bring that versatility and constant self-improvement is exactly what made Wale endure through decades in rap’s breakneck industry.

On Jan. 28, the night before a major 24-inch snowstorm rocked Boston, fans lined the stairway into The Sinclair to see British pop-sensation Griff. A little over a week after releasing her latest electro-pop single with Singrid, “Head On Fire,” Griff was in the Cambridge staple on her first ever American tour.
Walking out onto the stage in a checkered dress and her signature bubble braid, the singer and songwriter started the show with “Forgive Myself,” a song about letting go of failed relationships. A self-love ballad, the track epitomizes the feeling of getting energized before a fresh start, and it got the crowd excited for the rest of the show. Griff’s dynamic start to the show was followed by an acoustic version of “Walk,” celebrating that little something special she notices in a love interest.
Griff’s set featured lyrical, instrumental, and aesthetic range. Performing “Better” acoustically and “Earl Grey Tea” on the keyboard showcased Griff’s connection to various music genres like soul and classic pop. The mood of the performance was facilitated by the lighting transitions, illuminating Griff in shades of red and orange for lively songs and shades of purple for lyrical numbers. As the show progressed, Griff shared insights into the stories behind songs like “Good Stuff” and “Shade of Yellow.”
To Griff, “Good Stuff” is more than just a break up ballad. “Your brain has this way of only filtering out the best memories and it's so frustrating,” Griff said. She shared that her family would foster kids who later moved on and left their home, leaving Griff with just the “good stuff” she could remember from their stay. This made moving on a difficult process, but in a good way. “Shade of Yellow” is about a similar feeling of happy nostalgia.
“When you look back there’s a real safety and a haven in that memory and it’s about wondering why you keep running back to this place,” Griff said in her introduction to “Shade of Yellow.” The yellow lights above the stage during “Shade of Yellow” made it a particularly upbeat and positive performance, brightly illuminating Griff and elevating the mood as she danced.
Griff’s latest single with Singrid was scheduled to air on Jimmy Fallon later that evening. Griff expressed her joy for being able to collaborate with Singrid despite the competitive nature of the pop industry. She was met with the sounds of thundering applause.
Griff sang “Black Hole” as her final song of the night. Starting the song acoustically on her guitar, she climatically built up the energy of the crowd by dancing and encouraging them to belt out the words with her. Animated in their excitement for such a charged performance, fans demanded an encore moments later.
Overall, Griff delivered an astonishing performance, cementing her spot in the world of pop music and making an unforgettable night for everyone present.

“Red Flags: 6’4”, Mustache, Furniture Designer,” reads a billboard on a building in New York City. What appears to be another dating app advertisement is actually a reference to West Elm Caleb, TikTok’s latest topic of interest.
West Elm Caleb is the latest dating horror story to storm the internet after a young woman shared a bad New York City dating anecdote on TikTok. While this original video was coincidentally about an unrelated tall Caleb from NYC, which the original creator clarified in future videos, it sparked a slew of comments about a “West Elm Caleb '' and the video quickly went viral. Multiple Tiktok users began commenting about similar dating experiences: including strong initial interest from Caleb, prompt date plans, and subsequent ghosting. User @fairnuf wrote, “he was texting so much then ghosted after asking me to dinner.” Some users described the behavior as “love bombing” (which is a serious manipulation tactic used by manipulators) and claimed they received the same reused playlist from the dater. Users soon realized they were discussing the same Caleb, identifiable by his title as a furniture designer at West Elm, and dubbed him “West Elm Caleb.”
The TikTok algorithm spread West Elm Caleb videos across a variety of “For You” pages, so that even users beyond New York City began to follow the drama. One TikTok user, @abigailmarissa123420, commented on a viral video: “Me being from Georgia and in a healthy relationship fully invested in west elm Caleb.” In response to the story, TikTok users from DC also posted videos supporting their “NYC girls” and tall male users interested in furniture design shared their dismay at being considered “red flags” on TikTok.
As the tale of West Elm Caleb became more and more widespread, people began sharing their thoughts on the situation, from analyses of NYC’s dating scene to jokes about West Elm’s reaction. One TikTok user, @fitmarissa_, put a video scrolling through Caleb’s Hinge profile to the song “Womanizer” by Britney Spears, while user @dxnielbennett created a parody of how one of Caleb’s future dates might go. Brand social media accounts also joined in, running ads and campaigns capitalizing on the story’s audience. Ruggable posted a TikTok advertising their rugs by saying they weren’t designed by West Elm Caleb and the Empire State Building’s TikTok account posted a video about dating in NYC due to West Elm Caleb. The joke culminated into the red flag billboard taken out by the dating app Keepler, yet another brand reference to the West Elm Caleb story.
Though most videos made about West Elm Caleb appeared to be made in good fun, some users seemed determined to expose his personal information. West Elm Caleb’s dating profile, full name, and photos circulated across TikTok and his place of employment, West Elm, was repeatedly tagged in videos by commenters requesting a statement from them. Caleb eventually took down his LinkedIn profile, likely in light of the constant online harassment.
Despite early support, creators like @taylorlorenz and @tofu_eater voiced that this severe reaction did not equal the nature of West Elm Caleb’s “crimes.” According to some users, while ghosting people isn’t the greatest dating etiquette, it’s not an infraction that justifies anonymous users demanding statements from West Elm Caleb’s employer, sharing his personal information, and generally harassing him online.
This fierce reaction by people who West Elm Caleb (mostly) hasn’t met calls into question when it’s appropriate to try holding people accountable and how to do so productively. Where should the line be drawn for personal interactions, like dating, as opposed to professional ones? The internet has granted intimate access to other people’s personal lives, playing a large role in dating culture and creating space for important discussions. The story of West Elm Caleb is an example of just how powerful those social media conversations are.

Crocs are the face of ugly shoes. Still, alongside their close cousins, Birkenstock and Vibram FiveFingers, the rubber clog has only grown in popularity over the years. The chunky footwear, sometimes affectionately called “dad shoes,” more recently appeared to have exchanged comfort for chic — but did they really?
Between 2020 and 2021, Crocs was one of the fastest-growing fashion brands, seeing an increase of 430% in sales. Given the pandemic and extended quarantine, this pattern of consumption makes sense: People simply didn’t need to dress up as much. “They don’t have as much social responsibility about dressing. Just like sweatpants, Crocs benefited from that,” said Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
But Crocs is not simply a Cinderella under a pandemic spell. It’s an understatement to credit all of their success to the pandemic and comfort-seeking consumers. Indeed, Crocs didn’t become the “it” shoes overnight. Instead, the transformation of the iconic clog is two decades in the making, fueled by the overall rise of ugly fashion, celebrity and designer collaborations, and even changing gender narratives.
Founded in 2002, Crocs started out as boating shoes, capitalizing on their porous, light, and low-maintenance qualities as a sporting good. While the rise of Crocs started as early as the beginning of the century in tandem with the rest of “ugly” fashion, it has been accelerated by a surge of interest among Gen Z in recent years. Today, the shoes are loved by a wider audience, including celebrities and fashion creatives. Inaugurated at a boat show, Crocs now graze runways, red carpets, and TikTok feeds alike.
The brand’s star-studded collaborations include Post Malone’s tattoo-inspired Jibbitz in 2018, Bad Bunny’s glow-in-the-dark clog in 2020, and Justin Bieber’s cartoon-themed design in 2021, among others. “The idea of a celebrity wearing Crocs in particular situations, like on the red carpet, for example, really makes a statement: It’s ironic, it’s fun, people will certainly be talking about it,” said Colleen Hill, curator of costume and accessories at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. “Whether you hate them or love them, Crocs bring a lot of attention.”
In the world of higher fashion, Crocs have captured the imagination of Christopher Kane, Demna Gvasalia, and most recently, Salehe Bembury. These collaborations do more than draw clout: They provide stylistic breakthroughs to Crocs’ simple, original form that further catapult their status in the fashion world. In his recent release with Crocs, Bembury reconfigured the traditionally porous clog with a flowy, line-based design — a radical step for the brand. “Salehe is the first designer to literally ‘break’ the mold. Now, we’re also able to see new shoe architecture coming out of crocs. They’re showing in this collaboration with Salehe a willingness to be even more experimental,” said Elizabeth Semmelhack, the creative director and senior curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Canada.
It turns out, Crocs are an optimal canvas for designers to work with as well. According to Salehe Bembury, “Traditional footwear production is restrained by the capabilities or obstacles of leather, thread, or production time. The production of a Croc is not only revolutionary for footwear production but allows for an exploration of form that has never been seen in the space.” The flexibility of Crocs as a design medium leaves room for constant growth and embellishment. “I saw an opportunity to evolve an already established brand and signature design language,” said the shoe designer.
The culture of collaborations that made Crocs so successful may have been borrowed from its next-door neighbor, traditional sneakers. “They rival sneakers in an interesting way,” said Semmelhack. “There was this opportunity for Crocs to begin to model itself after what was so successful within the sneaker culture, which is to offer collaborations. Taking the idea of shoe collaboration and applying it to Crocs just at the right time also helped propel the brand forward.”
A leading argument for Crocs is also their emphasis on individuality. According to Hill, “It’s partly about this idea that maybe this younger generation, Gen Z, doesn’t feel the need to express transformation through fancy shoes, but through something that is accessible, recognizable, and at the same time, customizable.” From choosing Jibbitz that represent their identities to showing allegiance to particular celebrities, Crocs are a ready tool to display and distinguish oneself. “They’re not so much status shoes, but they’re certainly about self-expression and irony. I think in a way, that is the new means of transformation, showcasing that you’re confident and you want to wear this thing that’s not the most aesthetically perfect but has its own set of attributes like comfort and customization,” said Hill.
“Crocs with socks is definitely the move,” Justin Bieber said in a press statement on behalf of his 2021 collaboration with Crocs. “They’re comfortable, they’re fashionable, and most importantly it’s fun to bring your own style to how you wear them.” Under the banner of ugly fashion, any so-called style sins are absolvable, even trendy, making Crocs a liberating channel of self-expression. Celebrities like Bieber spearhead and validate the use of Crocs as a canvas of individuality.
An important feature of Crocs’ customizability is its gender neutrality. As society moves toward a more fluid and spectral perspective on gender, non-gendered footwear is increasingly embraced by consumers. Democratic in form, color, and customizability, Crocs are a compelling platform for self-expression in all dimensions. “If we continue to use the footwear we choose to assert our ideas of ourselves, Crocs just allows for a greater vocabulary in the statements we’re trying to make,” said Semmelhack.
Probing the reason behind the popularity of Crocs also calls for a broader understanding of the social meaning of shoes. “People seem to believe that shoes can actually change their lives. It’s like all these fairytale stories: ‘Cinderella,’ ‘Puss in Boots,’ or ‘Seven-league boots,’” said Steele. “Of all kinds of clothing and dress that people can wear, shoes are especially heavily endowed both as signs of identity and as kind of magical emblems.”
Shoes often serve as an incarnation of an individual’s aspirations, and Crocs could be an appealing vessel for this reason. “I think that Crocs are very strongly associated with children and play quality,” added Steele. “Maybe it’s that people feel that life will be more fun if they wear crocs. That would be a good magical thing to wish your shoes — to give you a more fun, playful life.”
Upon examining the changing ideas about fashion, individuality, and social contexts, maybe the ascension of Crocs isn’t so unusual after all. Crocs clogs aren’t just ugly — they are innovative, individualistic, and democratic. Certainly, they are more than a one-hit-wonder and here to stay for good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To my Black legacy child not yet in this world,
I write this letter to you in my sophomore year of college, at a time when — perhaps — the seemingly inflexible status of elite institutions is beginning to change.
Within the last decade, major developments have occurred in the movement for colleges and universities to abandon legacy admissions. While some notable universities — such as MIT and Caltech — have never considered one’s legacy status, most colleges do, although they are now starting to reconsider. Schools such as Johns Hopkins University and Amherst College — institutions well-known for producing long lineages of legacy alumni — have decided to remove legacy preference from the admissions process. And recently, the entire state of Colorado did away with the practice altogether. As a consequence, there has been a great push for Ivy League schools, such as Harvard, to follow suit.
And, my child, my feelings about this are complicated. On one hand, I feel strongly that legacy preference in college admissions should end, especially within the Ivy League. When Harvard applicants of legacy status have a nearly one in three chance of being admitted — compared to the general one in twenty statistic for non-legacy applicants — it clearly preserves a culture of elitism that cannot be extricated from Harvard’s deep history of racial discrimination. Since 1636 — even before the United States secured its nationhood by way of bloodied chains and fearsome weapons — white male students at Harvard could not only forge a path to greatness for themselves, but accelerate this road for their children. They could sharpen their minds while investing in their bloodlines, ensuring that each iteration of their descendants could attain this educational pedigree with more and more ease.
But for others — for people like you and me — this path was forbidden for a terribly long time. It took more than 250 years for the first Black person to graduate from Harvard College, and the Black undergraduates who followed were far from greeted warmly. Richard T. Greener ’1870 and other Black students who dared to infiltrate the Ivy League, had to fight fearlessly for their education and for their lives — sleeping in dormitories named after slaveholders, guarding against white students in pointed white hoods, and enduring forced segregation and egregious harassment for nothing more illicit than their Black presence at a white institution.
However, even in our new millennium — which those before us had hoped would bring newfound security and peace — Black Harvard students are still battling for the respect of our university. We are disproportionately targeted by campus police, routinely denied the creation of a safe space where we may love and protect each other, and told we are undeserving of our places at elite institutions by our own instructors. And, on top of all this, less than five percent of Black students at Harvard — compared to one out of five white students — have legacy status.
So it is under these circumstances, my child, that I owe it to us both to be honest.
More than anything, I want to give you what my ancestors were denied. I want you to have security and prosperity, success, and unimaginable joy. I want to provide for you what many of my white classmates have had for generations — a future paid for in advance.
I want this for you because you deserve it — no, because you are owed it, by this school and by this country. You are my legacy child, and a likelier chance of a Harvard admission is a tainted, yet immortal gift. How come it has to expire as soon as it's your turn to have it?
I know I sound like a petulant child: “It’s not fair.” Am I not longing for a power that has suppressed our people for ages? I feel like I am being enticed by some sinister force. The goal of white supremacy is to be self-replicating — it is to secure wealth and power for one’s children no matter the cost, no matter who is trampled along the way. I want you to have it all — but never at another’s expense.
And, as my legacy child, I am certain that you will be born into a privilege that I was not.
You are much more likely to come from a higher tax bracket, and contribute to the long-standing problem of disportionate wealth among Harvard students — a problem that often deters low-income high schoolers from even applying. You will have insider knowledge of the college application process, access to tutoring and advisors, and an impressive resume that will reflect the abundance of resources you had at your disposal. You will be far ahead of the curve, and make other kids of less-privileged backgrounds feel like they could never catch up. You would become the very applicant who once disadvantaged students like me.
I cannot let this happen. I can’t advocate for a system that was designed to keep us out. Therefore, I must let go of this infinite and poisoned gift. I’m sorry, my child. I promise, I am always thinking of you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bringing another soul into what often feels like a cruel world is one of the most dangerous events for women — especially the Black ones. What emerges from the birth canal of the Black woman is not only the miracle of life, but also an extension of the psychic, emotional, and physical reflections of what it means to be breathing while Black. Alongside her suckling infant she gives birth to new-born fears for what will follow her innocent child everywhere — from the streets to the hospitals, to the classroom, to the jail cell, and beyond. And through mother’s milk passes not only stem cells and antibodies, but also an acute awareness of an actively anti-Black world.
Sometimes I lay awake at night and think of the things I will pass to my future Black child, and it is then that I am reminded that in conjunction with triumph, tragedy, and all things in between, one in three children that I might give life to from my Black uterus will likely get the opportunity to walk the paths of Harvard Yard as a college student someday. And while there are many a tragic legacy the world may attempt to impose onto my child’s life, it’s ironically safe to say that this is not one.
I guess what I’m saying is: I take no issue with the Harvard legacy that will come from my womb.
Legacy admissions at Harvard is in many respects an unjust practice that primarily serves the privileged. Plainly put, it is a symptom of the white supremacist undergirds of higher education — because in the practice of uplifting the privileged, those left at a disadvantage are often the ones who identify as part of minority, low-income, and first-generation populations.
This critical perspective on legacy admissions fundamentally — and rightfully — denounces the winners and weaves a narrative from the threads of seemingly clear-cut, progressive, equitable ideas. Nevertheless, it is a presentist, reductionist narrative with built-in erasure of some of the very same demographics we argue deserve more visibility. Because the reality is, histories and legacies are complex — and they warrant a nuanced perspective on the fact that although we must be aware of where tools of oppression are at work, for many, idealizing a disdain for legacy admissions is not quite so simple.
My future Black child will bring with them more than my (by then, decades-old) Harvard degree to a college application. That one in three chance at a “second-look” from a Harvard admissions counselor is accompanied by my daughter’s four in 10 chance of experiencing intimate partner violence, my son’s one in 1,000 chance at being killed at the hands of police, and my queer child’s at least four in five chance at facing negative physical, spiritual, and psychological effects on their wellbeing — odds not easily able to be written off as some unfair advantage at walking through the world. From conception, I’ll fear that my Black son cannot go for a run, my Black daughter cannot rest peacefully in her bed at home, and my Black, queer child may fall victim to a heinous hate crime. It is excruciatingly clear that some of the legacies that will follow my children are not the same as those of their white peers.
The truth is that the world at once robbed me of a safe and easy ignorance, thrusting me into a mode of consciousness that permeates everything in life, from walking down the street to choosing classes, friends, and future careers. And the unfortunate reality of the ongoing social dynamic in which we live is that by measures beyond my control, the world will likely rob the freeing simplicity of some things in life from my child too. To breathe while Black — to be while Black — is not simple. The politics of inheritance are not without complexity, and are certainly not lost on us. It is something Black people know all too well, and often not from the winning side.
So while Beyoncé gave her daughter a Grammy, I’ll settle for giving mine a one in three chance to study at one of the world’s premier institutions — because most stats already aren’t in her favor.
I will fight like hell to leave my children legacies of love and resistance to balance out all of what I unfortunately know will follow them throughout the course of their lives. I will dedicate my life to creating the most equitable and safe world to bring them into. At the very least, if I can’t flip this anti-Black world on its head in my lifetime, I know I can give them a 33 percent chance to not just get in the door at a place like Harvard, but to make sure they stay in the building with the lights on and bills paid after they’ve crossed the threshold — especially considering that we were barred from entering the College gates for longer than we’ve been allowed inside them. I’m giving them an added possibility — if they want it — to raise questions about society and why it can’t be what we dream it to be, to participate in the continued shaping of the community, to fight for a conscious pedagogical ambition, and to open more doors behind them after they go.
And hopefully some of the dreams occupying their nights need not reflect entirely the nightmares of my own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in high school, on paper, I was dazzling. Perfect, accomplished, put together. Because I had to be. I was able to fool everyone, at the cost of devoting every drop of energy to ensuring the performance would go on.
Cut to my personal writings — the backstage tell-all, in which my self-resentment, frustration, and disappointment are captured brutally, honestly, and angrily on tear-stained graph paper in my AP Calc BC binder. “I’m not good enough,” and “feel nothing but bad at everything.” They read messily, and I was convinced I deserved to feel that way.
I was formally diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety years later, at 19. Though I’d known about my anxiety for years, it was actually during my first year at Harvard that I started to put the pieces of the ADHD puzzle together. It clicked when reading the diagnostic criteria for ADHD felt like the results of a personality quiz of traits I once desperately tried to unlearn or hide.
Still, the ADHD diagnosis was hard to accept at first, both for me and for Jailene Ramos ‘24, who was diagnosed with ADHD and clinical depression during summer 2021. As Ramos describes, “I was a straight-A student, graduated valedictorian.” She tells me, “I’ve always had to be on top of it,”a sentiment that we bond over. “So how is it possible that I have ADHD?” Ramos recalls thinking to herself.
Steph Brecq ‘24, a fellow neurodivergent student with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, captures this duality best: “you may function really well in some places, but you’re really struggling in others and that gets unnoticed.”
Therein lies the power of knowing or recognizing that you’re neurodivergent — the privilege to actually try thriving on your own terms, or at the least, validate your experiences by unlearning internalized ableism. This privilege of diagnosis, of discovery, or simply of openly being neurodivergent is denied to so many for so long due to countless interacting forces, be it social, financial, cultural. So, in turn, we learn to internalize our needs and rule out the very possibility of being neurodivergent.
Without the neurodiversity explanation, you and the people closest to you constantly push the questions of, “but if you can do all this, why can’t you manage something as simple as that?” And yet, when you find the courage to bring up your struggles, you’re too smart to be struggling. The only seemingly logical answer is that you’re the problem. “I’m just not trying hard enough, I’m making it up, It’s all in my head”, I’d think to myself, though it quite literally was.
Though you may not recognize the label of internalized ableism, it’s everywhere. It’s the thoughts I just described. It’s the deep-rooted beliefs that “not doing things means you're lazy,” or, “if you can't pay attention in class, you don't care” Alyx Britton ‘21, a recent Harvard graduate with ADHD, relays. Thus, “it was really powerful to be able to to put a finger on what was going on as neurodivergence,” they continue, because “I can at least be like, ‘Alyx, you're not objectively bad.’ I will still feel bad about myself. But I know it is not because of a worldly judgment on me. It was because of things I've learned,” and in knowing that, they can “work against that.”
At its core, working against internalized ableism is being yourself and asserting your needs. It’s sending the email that you need an extension, it’s letting go of the shame of talking too quickly and too loudly, my personal power combo. It’s stimming; it’s empathy for yourself. So, to “allow myself to be okay with struggling whenever I'm experiencing an episode” as Ramos relates, is radical.
This isn’t to say that earlier diagnosis or discovery of our neurodivergence may have definitively changed things for the better, considering how rampant stigma remains. As Brecq explains, “whether it be just having a lot of energy and talking or doing random things or stimming, there’s certain things that just have this connotation of ‘oh, that is somebody who is neurodivergent, and as such, that is somebody who is in some ways almost inhuman or less than or just not intelligent.’”
We are definitely not Harvard’s first or only neurodivergent students. Because experiences like ours aren’t discussed enough, most of the time, it’s lonely. “On the outside, they look put together. They have that same mask on that I had on my entire life. They're still stuck inside the box,” Ramos says. “Luckily, I've been able to sort of break free of the box,” she expresses. But, “Because we see everybody also trapped inside the box putting up this wall of, everything is fine. Everything's perfect,” we still ask ourselves, as Ramos emphasizes, “Oh my god, what is wrong with me?”
I write this from outside the box, having left behind the performance of perfection. After nineteen years, I finally know that there was never anything wrong with me. Unknowingly neurodivergent? Yes. Wrong? Never, though it takes a lot of courage to remember. From a former boxmate, I urge you to consider breaking the box of put-togetherness. Punch out of perfection. Here outside the walls, we’ll fight for the freedom to be everything we are, neurodivergent and more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously passed an amended policy order Monday to study alternative uses for the Fresh Pond Golf Course, in response to concerns from Cambridge residents regarding the original proposed policy.
The vote followed a public comment period of nearly two hours, in which more than 30 Cambridge residents voiced their opinions on the proposed policy order. Most of those who spoke said they opposed any reduction of the size of the course — which is also known as the Thomas P. O’Neill Jr. Golf Course in honor of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives.
The original policy order — proposed by Councilors Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80, Dennis J. Carlone, Quinton Y. Zondervan, and Burhan Azeem — calls for a study of the course to consider whether golf is the “best use” of the area and “if other uses are possible and should be considered.”
Some public attendees said they were worried that the course would eventually be converted from a nine-hole to a six-hole course, which they claimed would hinder its use. They added that a six-hole course would not meet regulations for holding tournaments.
“A six-hole, par-three course isn’t a golf course,” Lyn Ketterer, who coordinates a ladies’ league at the golf course, said. “It is a glorified, condensed chip-and-putt.”
Ann C. Roosevelt ’66, the president of the Cambridge Water Board, said that her board has authority over any changes to the course's use and added that modifications to the course would threaten the Cambridge water supply.
“The golf course acts as a buffer to protect the Cambridge water supply,” she said. “Adding any structures or repurposing for intense uses would reduce or eliminate that buffer.”
Andrew B. Schlesinger ’70, one of the residents who spoke in favor of the policy order, argued that the course was underutilized by Cambridge residents and that the land could be better used to address Cambridge’s affordable housing supply problems.
“The golf course occupies too much municipal space and benefits too few people,” Schlesinger said. “Exploring alternative uses for the 50-plus acres of the golf course seems to be a no-brainer in this fast-changing environment.”
Following the public comment period, Councilor Paul F. Toner proposed a substitute to the order specifying that normal golf operations continue uninterrupted throughout the study alternative uses for the land.
“I wanted to make it clear that we were not seeking to interfere with golf at the Fresh Pond Golf Course, but didn’t want to stifle conversations about additional uses it might be put towards,” Toner said in an interview with The Crimson.
Nolan said in an interview with The Crimson that she found the opposition to the initial order “disappointing.”
“I’m disappointed that the community of golfers didn’t see that we have to think about the entire city,” Nolan said.
Nonetheless, she said that the modified order was still “very close to what we were asking for.”
“[The order] really was saying, ‘Hey, there’s lots of possible uses for land,’” Nolan said. “Let’s understand what we can do with it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen praised the University’s spring semester Covid-19 policies — which now require students to isolate in their dorms and conduct their own contact tracing — at a faculty meeting Tuesday.
Before the change in protocol last month, the University conducted contact tracing and provided isolation housing for students who tested positive for Covid-19. In response, some students said they are apprehensive about the shift in policy amid a surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers also filed a grievance with the University last month over the updated Covid-19 guidelines, listing among its demands the need to restart isolation housing for undergraduates.
Nguyen said during Tuesday’s faculty meeting that despite initial “trepidation” about the new policies, the isolate-in-place policy seems to be “working very well,” adding that not “forcing students” into separate housing contributes to better mental health among students.
“When you have a highly vaccinated community as we do, the risk of severe illness is that much less,” Nguyen said. “We can really start implementing these types of changes in a way that maintains safety because we know we have a vaccinated community.”
According to Nguyen, the majority of those on campus will be exposed to Omicron, but masking will prevent most from contracting the virus.
Nguyen also noted that Harvard’s positivity rate has decreased since last month’s surge in cases but has not yet returned to the lower rates of the previous semester. During the first week of January, Harvard reported a record-breaking 977 positive cases.
Within the last week, 267 Harvard affiliates tested positive for Covid-19, marking a positivity rate of 0.74 percent, according to Harvard’s Covid-19 dashboard.
In a November interview before the Omicron-driven surge, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said Harvard would be working to unmask in indoor spaces in the spring. However, Nguyen reiterated Tuesday that although the University will eventually make masking and testing optional, “we’re not there right now.”
Following Nguyen’s presentation, faculty also voted 98 percent in favor of making the College’s temporary privacy policy permanent in the 2022-2023 student handbook. The privacy policy prohibits students from publishing or distributing course material without written permission from the instructor.
The remainder of the meeting was dedicated to discussing whether college degree credit should be conferred for summer school courses offered remotely.
Prior to the pandemic, students could only take summer courses for credit if they were taught in person. Last summer, the Standing Committee on Educational Policy passed a temporary authorization for remote course credit.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh said during the meeting that this temporary policy, in addition to other factors such as the College's move to provide summer courses to some students for free, had a “striking” effect on summer school enrollment — nearly twice as many students took summer school courses last year.
The faculty will vote on the permanent policy at next month’s faculty meeting.

Members of the student group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine held a protest Tuesday condemning Amos Yadlin, a retired Israeli Defense Forces general who is serving as a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center this semester.
Six supporters of the student group rallied outside an HKS classroom where Yadlin led the first meeting of his semester-long study group about Israeli national security.
Christian B. Tabash ’22, a Palestinian student, called Yadlin a “war criminal” and denounced Harvard’s appointment of a top official in the Israeli military, which Tabash said is “responsible for decades of ethnic cleansing and dispossession of Palestinians.”
Shraddha Joshi ’24, a member of Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, said Yadlin’s study group “speaks to the University’s lack of regard for Palestinian narratives.”
Protestors pressed signs criticizing Yaldin against the windows of the study group’s classroom and handed out flyers to students leaving the event.
In an interview after the end of the study group, Yadlin said he stood by his career in the Israeli military.
“I’m very proud [of] my service to my country to defend Israel from those who want to destroy it,” he said. “All I have done in my service was according to the international law.”
Yadlin served in the IDF for 40 years, including 33 as a fighter pilot, eventually rising to become deputy commander of the Israeli Air Force. He was promoted to major general in 2002 and later worked as defense attaché to the United States.
“I came to the Kennedy School to share my experience with the students,” Yadlin said. “And I’m very happy to do it and willing to discuss every issue with everybody in my office.”
Joshi said she attended the rally to protest the students attending the study group, in addition to Yadlin himself.
“We want to give a message to the students that they should be really mindful of the kind of people that they’re platforming,” Joshi said. “It’s also a larger message to the University, to sort of think about how Harvard has been — and is complicit in — issues of colonialism and apartheid.”
Joseph G. Leone, an HKS student who attended the protests, called Yadlin’s appointment as a senior fellow “shocking and disgusting” and criticized HKS for giving a platform to someone “whose career is entirely premised on the violence and dispossession against Palestinians.”
The study group’s first meeting came on the same day Amnesty International released a “damning” report concluding Israel is committing apartheid against Palestinians.
Leone said the Yadlin invitation is “part of a pattern that the Kennedy School is engaged in.”
“They brought so many figures that have had a direct role in apartheid and settler colonialism and Palestine,” he said. “I don’t like to see my institution and my school and this place of learning to celebrate those atrocities through fellowships like this.”
Leone also called on participants in the study group to stop attending its meetings.
“I think they should withdraw from the class and should not be complicit in the celebration of this war criminal,” he said.
Joshi said Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine intends to keep protesting at the study group’s weekly meetings.
“We intend to maintain a sustained effort to spread awareness about HOOP and push back against Harvard’s choice to platform the fellow,” she wrote in a statement.

Charles V. Willie, an American sociologist and Harvard Graduate School of Education professor famed for his work on school integration, race relations, and public health, died at the age of 94 on Jan. 11.
Known for his humility, passion for sociology, and mentorship, Willie was honored with numerous awards and honorary doctoral degrees throughout his life, including degrees from 15 colleges and universities and awards from Syracuse University, Morehouse College, the American Sociological Association, and the Eastern Sociological Society. He also served on President Carter’s Commision on Mental Health in 1977.
Willie attended Morehouse College, graduating as class president in 1948 alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. After receiving a master’s degree from Atlanta University in 1949, Willie began his work at Syracuse University, where he earned his doctoral degree.
He taught at Syracuse for 24 years and was named as the school’s first Black tenured faculty member, later rising to be the vice president for student affairs.
Willie came to teach at Harvard in 1974. Former HGSE Dean Jerome T. Murphy said Willie stood out as “kind of a role model for what a good professor at a professional school is.”
“He was a wonderful teacher, both substantively and in terms of helping students, and he was a mentor to a lot of people,” Murphy said. “They looked up to him because he combined scholarship with practice and a heart — a big heart.”
Soon after moving to Boston, Willie worked on landmark school integration cases, reviewing and advising the city on its school desegregation plan.
University of Texas at Austin professor Richard J. Reddick, a former student and colleague of Willie’s, described how Willie’s commitment to equity and justice extended to his role as vice president within the Episcopal Church. Willie publicly resigned from his post after the national church refused to recognize the ordinations of women in several dioceses.
“He just said, ‘I can't be part of something that is discriminatory or unethical,’” Reddick said. “So, you know, somebody who both talked the talk and walked the walk in his personal life and his academic life.”
Swarthmore College Provost Sarah S. Willie-LeBreton, the oldest of Willie’s three children, said rather than strive for work-life balance, he would question how “the vocation of one’s work life” could be applied to their everyday activities.
“He found his work and all aspects of it so applicable to everything around us — not just to the classroom, not just to the scholarship, but to his activities in the churches where they belonged, to the school systems that we were in, to the issues that came up in any city or town where we lived,” Willie-LeBreton said.
Willie authored 30 books and more than 100 articles throughout his life, including several editions of “A New Look at Black Families,” which he co-wrote with Reddick.
Murphy praised Willie’s dedication to education and compassion for the students he mentored throughout his career.
“It was this kind of combination of this, really, fierceness towards making schools better — particularly around issues of justice — with this kind of softness and genuineness and caring for the students that made him special.” said Murphy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Presidential Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, launched by University President Lawrence S. Bacow in November 2019, plans to organize a series of events in the coming months before presenting its findings in April.
Started at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the initiative explores Harvard’s historic ties with slavery. Kicking off on March 24, the committee's slate of events will include university-wide panels and virtual tours, leading up to an April 29 conference presenting the group’s work.
The committee’s final report and recommendations will focus on the lasting impact of slavery on the school’s curriculum, campus life, medical education, and museum collections. Committee members have also examined Harvard’s links to sugar plantations in Antigua and other Caribbean nations.
“All of the public programming this spring is designed to engage with findings in the historical report, which will be published in late spring,” an email from the Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery team reads.
In March, guest speaker Michael W. Twitty will chronicle his work as a history interpreter and culinary historian, presenting his scholarship of African American foodways and legacies.
A panel in April, hosted in collaboration with the Eileen Southern Initiative, will focus on the connection between American choral music and race. A performance by the Aeolians — a choir from Oakwood University founded by Eva B. Dykes, the first Black female Ph.D. graduate from Radcliffe College — in Sanders Theater will follow.
Former Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow and HGSE professor Meira Levinson led the initiative’s subcommittee on curriculum, which created a film on the views of students and scholars on the University’s history and ties to slavery. Radcliffe Institute will air the film this spring.
Other scheduled offerings include a virtual walking tour showcasing Harvard’s history, a student art exhibition, and a ceremony of “remembrance and healing.” The committee wrote in an email that it hopes public health considerations allow for the gatherings to occur in-person, but it plans to make live streaming and recordings of the events available.
“The April 29 conference and indeed all of our events this semester will engage in one way or another with the broad question: What must we now do, and how can we ensure that the revelation of this history can inspire renewed commitment to institutional reform, to community engagement, and to our highest aspirations as a community of learning?” the team wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Observers of the Lunar New Year across Harvard’s campus ushered in the Year of the Tiger Tuesday by going on excursions to Chinatown, making traditional desserts, and planning celebration dinners.
Linda K. Lin ’24, social chair for the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, said for East Asian students, this holiday is an exciting time to celebrate their cultural heritage.
“I think it’s a great opportunity for many cultures — probably more East Asian cultures — to get together and celebrate and have activities,” Lin said. “It is a really fun, festive time for community.”
Kirkland House resident Joanna Boyland ’23 said that growing up, celebrations of the holiday often involved gatherings of hundreds of people.
“We’d have a potluck, and then people would demonstrate dancing or various other things,” Boyland said. “Little kids would sing, and they would do performing arts and eat food.”
The College’s social distancing protocols prevented student groups from hosting events with large gatherings this year, but the celebrations continued on campus in various forms. In Kirkland House, Boyland made a traditional Lunar New Year dish for 100 of her housemates.
“This year I was recruited last minute by HoCo to make some nian gao, which is Chinese sticky rice pudding,” Boyland said.
Angie D. Shin ’23, co-president of the Asian American Womxn’s Association, said that despite not being raised in a “super heritage-rich” household, she would celebrate this Lunar New Year in Boston.
“I’m definitely getting some takeout from Chinatown with my block and linkmates,” she said.
But she acknowledged Covid-19 has restricted AAWA’s festivities.
“If Covid wasn't happening, we'd probably be in the middle of planning some kind of huge part-Asians Lunar New Year event right now,” Shin said. “Hopefully we can do that in years to come.”
AAWA plans on hosting a Lunar New Year celebration and dinner on Feb. 6, featuring foods from several cultures that celebrate the holiday.
“It’s just going to be some fun music, getting to know one another, and trying to replicate a little bit of that community energy,” Lin said.
Shin said she hopes for the holiday to become more well-known in future years.
“I definitely look towards a future where that’s a little bit more equitable and where people of color can find rest throughout the year, beyond just white holidays,” Shin said.
“Take today to rest and pat yourself on the back for a good former lunar year and appreciate yourself,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The controversial leaders of Harvard’s Undergraduate Council rolled out a new application last month, Crimson OpenGov, that crowdsources student opinion on school-related issues.
Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 rolled out the app, which is available on the web and from the Apple App Store, on Jan. 26.
The app lists pre-written questions about issues at Harvard, allowing students to write responses of up to 420 characters. Users can then vote “agree,” “disagree,” or “neutral” on other students’ written responses.
The app aims to enhance conversation on a wide range of topics concerning student life — including Harvard’s dining services, Covid-19 policies, and shopping week.
As of Feb. 1, the app had amassed more than 400 users, according to Cheng — about 7 percent of the College’s population. De Kanter said he hoped to increase participation in the app’s polls.
Some members of the UC said they supported the platform, but criticized how Cheng rolled it out.
“I think it’s a fantastic idea,” Oak Yard Representative Laila A. Nasher ’25 said. “I don’t agree with a lot of what the administration is doing, but I think this is great.”
Crimson Yard representative Owen O. Ebose ’25 said he is “all for what the OpenGov app does,” adding that the Council “desperately needs more student input.” Still, he said Cheng should have involved more members of the body in the initiative.
“There’s been a bit of a disconnect between Michael’s team and the rest of the council,” he said.
Cheng was elected UC president in November after pledging during the campaign to “defund” the body. In an email to College students last week, he and de Kanter wrote that they are moving ahead with plans to rewrite the UC’s constitution and dissolve the body in favor of a “new, 21st-century student government designed by Harvard students.”
Cheng previously represented Quincy House as a UC general member.
Cheng defended the app’s rollout, saying the UC had previously declined to take on the project. He also took aim at a constitutional amendment the body passed in December that changed voting thresholds for campus-wide referenda, saying it amounted to an attempt to overthrow his election victory.
“They made the choice to try to undermine the election results and play games, and so, if they’re willing to make up, I’m happy to work with them — but they’ve got to do that,” Cheng said. “I would also be complaining if I felt a little left out, but they made the choice to be left out.”
At least one student reported problems with the app, which was developed by Cheng and some of his friends.
“I went online to look through it and it was very much confusing,” said Ricardo R. Razon IV ’25. “I did not know how to use it.”
Cheng says he plans to use polling data sourced from the app as leverage in negotiations with campus administrators.
“It’s a way for us to get the student voice back in the University, and a lot of administrators respond to data,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — The 43rd installment of the Beanpot Tournament, Boston’s annual clash featuring Boston University and Northeastern alongside Harvard and Boston College, began at Matthews Arena Tuesday night after a nearly two-year hiatus. The Harvard women’s ice hockey team used a strong third period to pull away from Boston University in the opening game of the tournament.
The No. 6/8 Crimson (16-5-0, ECAC 12-3-0) extended its win streak to seven with the win over the Terriers (10-10-4, 9-6-3 Hockey East). The victory, the first in the Beanpot for Harvard since 2019, propelled the Crimson to its 30th appearance in the Beanpot final.
“You can float around the ice or you can play with purpose,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone. “I think the biggest thing is that our kids believe in themselves and their teammates.”
The first period proved to be one for the defenses, as neither team could score. Early in the period, both teams possessed the puck and fired shots on goal. Harvard’s best opportunity came when BU’s Kylie Roberts was assessed a two-minute penalty for roughing. However, the chance came and went as the Terriers were able to successfully kill off the power play. At the 13-minute mark, Crimson junior forward Kristin Della Rovere almost struck first blood. Her shot narrowly missed, careening off the left pipe. BU also had a chance to play the advantage in the first after Harvard junior defender Maryna Macdonald was called for tripping. The Terriers also failed to convert their power play, with Harvard returning to even strength with three minutes remaining in the first.
The Crimson struck first in the second period, when first-year forward Taze Thompson took the pass from senior forward Brooke Jovanovich and sent it between BU goaltender Kate Stuart’s legs. The momentum continued to swing Harvard’s way as it went on the power play at the seven-minute and ten-minute marks. However, the Terriers were able to weather the storm and kill off both of the power plays. A few minutes later, BU scored the equalizer when Lacey Martin slid one past Harvard senior goalie Becky Dutton.
To begin the third, both goalies were locked in, stopping shot after shot. This was the first time in the 2021-22 season that the Crimson had entered the third period tied. The Terriers had an opportunity to take the lead at the three minute mark when Harvard senior defender Emma Buckles was penalized for slashing. The Crimson were able to fight off the power play once again, this time holding BU without a shot on goal. Three minutes later, it was the Terriers’ turn to play one woman down, as Emma Wuthrich received a two-minute minor for tripping.
However, the Crimson again had no luck on the power play. Harvard’s best chance on the power play went awry when Della Rovere fired a slap shot that caused her stick to split in half and her shot to once again hit the pipe. With eight minutes already gone in the third, it appeared as though the game was destined for overtime. However, the Crimson played by the words its coach told them during the intermission before the third period.
“Don’t stop until you win,” Stone said.
Harvard found its lead thanks to its talented first line. With 11 minutes to go, junior forward Anne Bloomer delivered a pass from senior forward Becca Gilmore into the back of the cage.
“It’s super easy to play with Kristin [Della Rovere] and Becca [Gilmore],” said Bloomer. “I think we all have a good sense of when to pass and when to shoot.”
Bloomer, the team leader in goals, added another one six minutes later to extend the Crimson’s lead to two and bring her season total to 17. Della Rovere sealed the win when she scored off an assist from Gilmore with four minutes remaining.
Dutton, the reigning ECAC goalie of the month, made 21 saves to secure the victory. In the process, she also picked up her seventh straight win in goal.
The 4-1 victory sends Harvard to the Beanpot Championship and gives its the opportunity to win its 12th title, which would be its first since 2015.
Next up, the Crimson return to ECAC play with a pair of matchups versus Colgate (20-6-1, ECAC 10-4-1) and Cornell (9-9-2, ECAC 7-6-2) in New York.

The Harvard ski team built on a strong start to the season with a seventh-place finish at the Saint Michael’s Carnival on January 21st and 22nd. Career-best performances were a dime a dozen for the Crimson, with junior Annabel Hagen, junior Emma Ryan, sophomore Liam McNamara, sophomore Elsie Halvorsen, and first-year Mads Groeholdt all having record days.
Despite delays due to negative temperatures, Harvard’s nordic squad made their mark. Groeholdt, who has placed top-25 in all three events of his career, led the Crimson in the 10k with a 14th-place finish. Senior James Kitch and senior Everett Sapp finished 27th and 28th respectively, pushing until the end to reach the finish line seconds apart. In the 5k, Sapp nabbed 19th place, followed by Kitch in 20th and Groeholdt in 25th. Not to be outdone, the women made their mark on the course as well. First-year Quincy Donley came in 36th in the 25k on Friday. This was followed by a successful 5k Saturday for Harvard, with Hagen leading the charge in 23rd and senior Ursula Volz following closely behind in 24th. Coupled with a 41st-place finish for Donley and 43rd place for sophomore Laura Appleby, they were able to cement a solid seventh.
“It was definitely fun to see your hard work actually pan out and get a good result,” Hagen said. However, she is looking to make progress. “It was nice to be top 25, but definitely have some higher goals.”
Harvard’s alpine group posted record times as well, with Friday’s giant slalom seeing senior Nellie Ide achieve a season-best 18th place. Halvorsen came in right after at 19th, with Ryan finishing in 30th. Saturday’s slalom events meant record days for Halvorsen and Ryan, with Halvorsen cracking the top-10 for the first time in her career at 10th, and Ryan coming in at a career-best 15th. Although Ide’s slalom resulted in a did not finish (DNF), Halvorsen and Ryan’s numbers still managed to place the women’s squad in seventh.
The men’s showing was also filled with standout performances. On Friday’s giant slalom, McNamara posted a career-best 12th, with junior Jack Despres representing the Crimson well in 19th. Although first-year Matt Ryan had his race result in a DNF, he was clocked in third halfway down the course on the split timer. Saturday’s slalom resulted in a 15th place finish for Ryan and a 21st place finish for McNamara, who has not missed the top 25 so far this season.
“We have a very small team,” said McNamara, “But everyone's been doing really well, performing really well. In past years we'd be lucky to get one or two people in the top 30 of these races..but we've gotten like four or five athletes in the top 30 in most races we've been to…we're small, but we're mighty.”
Next, the Crimson will head back to Vermont on February 4 to take part in the UVM Carnival, where Alpine and Nordic will compete in Stowe and Craftsbury, respectively.

If you think about it, Harvard and Hogwarts have a lot of similarities. Annenberg looks like the Great Hall (the freshman dorm banners are definitely not copying the Hogwarts house banners), we get “sorted” into residential houses (although not by a cool sorting hat), Massachusetts Avenue and JFK Street are basically Hogsmeade (Tatte is our Honeydukes, and Russell House Tavern replaces the Three Broomsticks — sadly without the butterbeer), and Boston is basically London (let’s collectively agree that there’s a platform nine and three quarters at South Station, okay? It’ll make me happy).
My winter break Harry Potter movie marathon got me thinking. There are so many niche study spots on campus, and if the golden wizarding trio and their fellow Hogwarts-dwellers attended Harvard, where would they go to do their charms or potions homework? Check out this list to find out which Harry Potter character you are based on your go-to study spot — Yer a Wizard Harvard Student, after all.
If you study at Smith, you’re a Weasley. 
Smith is basically the burrow with its many nooks, crannies, and mismatched rooms. It can’t be a coincidence that the red furniture sprinkled throughout the building matches the iconic Weasley hair, and the social, bubbly, and collaborative atmosphere of Smith mirrors the fun-loving, never-dull dynamic of the Weasley family. Side note: If you frequent the Collaborative Commons, you’re either Fred or George, because you crave a social atmosphere — silence is not your vibe.
If you study on the second floor of Lamont, you’re a Dementor. 
Not to be rude, but everyone on the second floor of Lamont looks pretty lifeless and absolutely devoid of joy. Dementors literally suck the soul out of someone — which is what the second floor of Lamont will do to you.
If you study in the stacks, you’re Draco Malfoy. 
Think about it: the stacks are like the Chamber of Secrets. What goes on there? Who is down there? The ambiguity reminds me of none other than our brooding (and handsome — refer to Tom Felton in “The Half-Blood Prince” or Draco-Tok if you doubt me) villain, Draco Malfoy. Given that the floors in Widener go on for eternity, the stacks would be the perfect place for Draco to sneak Death Eaters into the school. What plots (among other things) take place down there?
If you study in a coffee shop, you’re Ginny.
Local coffee shops only, of course. You’d never find Ginny at Starbucks (R.I.P. the Harvard Square Starbucks) or Peet’s, but rather at Flour or Pavement. You, like Ginny, are independent but like to be surrounded by action.
If you study in the Law School or in Widener’s Loker Reading Room, you’re Hermione. 
This is a no-brainer. What screams Hermione more than the ivory pillars and the Latin-inscribed walls of the Law School or being surrounded by more than 3.5 million volumes and Widener’s general light-academia vibe? Hermione would fit right in, studying to ace her O.W.L.s alongside serious law students or in the zip-up-your-backpack-and-you'll-receive-dirty-looks Loker Reading Room.
If you study in an empty classroom in Sever, you’re Dobby.
I can’t explain it, but Dobby gives off big Sever vibes. Maybe it’s because our favorite free elf probably smells like Sever does – ancient and musty.
If you study in Cabot, you’re Harry. 
Harry was a hard one to place, but of course our favorite hero must be included. I ultimately think Cabot would be up his alley. You can get stuff done, but the Science Center is also a pretty social place and Harry is a pretty popular guy (except for in “The Order of the Phoenix” when everyone thought he was lying about the return of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named).
If you book a group study room for yourself, you’re Neville. 
It’s not the fact that you want to be annoying … you’re just clueless. There is nothing worse than trying to find a spot to work on a group project and finding a single person in a room meant for six. It’s somewhat acceptable if you’re in a Zoom meeting, but why can’t you do that in your dorm? You have good intentions but … come on, read the room (pun intended).
Maybe all the parallels I am drawing between Harvard and Hogwarts are in an attempt to compensate for never having received my Hogwarts letter when I was eleven. I’m still not over it. Until I am, I’ll live vicariously, romanticizing studying by pretending Harvard is, in fact, Hogwarts.
