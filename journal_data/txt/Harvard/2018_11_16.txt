After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We here at The Crimson Editorial Board have often opined on the problems with The Game this year. We had trouble finding a time to go get tickets at the Smith Campus Center with our blockmates, we’re still not entirely sure why the Game was moved to Fenway in the first place, and it sure seems that 10,000 men of Harvard wanted tailgates that day. We remain concerned that this year’s Game face logistical difficulties that might ruin the festivities — and it pains us to admit that we might be letting down our Connecticut counterparts this year, though perhaps not as much as they let down their families by not going to Harvard.
Not to dwell on it, but imagine: Early Saturday morning, Harvard and Yale students will awake to the sound of the Harvard Band pounding up JFK St. Something, however, will not be the same. Instead of heading merrily across the bridge to Cumnock Field, they will trudge over to the Science Center Plaza (hopefully, per Dr. Paul J. Barreira’s advice, stopping at Annenberg for breakfast) to linger around Tanner Fountain. Clambering onto the shuttle buses, they will endure the long journey over to Fenway. Given the recent wintry weather's likely effect on travel conditions, who knows how many will wipe out on the way to the stadium, like Yale linemen against the Crimson wall? Who knows how many Saybrookians will risk hypothermia in the third quarter? Who knows if the body heat we will store from being crammed in the Ipswich Lot will last the duration of the Game?
Despite our concerns, we remain excited about the Game and all the promise it holds in store. We find it exceptionally deplorable that the Classes of 2020, 2021, and 2022 have yet to see a Yale drubbing at Harvard's hands. We hope that the Crimson’s victory will add light to our school’s superiority, much as Yalies added light to our motto instead of coming up with its own.
We’re holding out for an especially triumphant Harvard win this year, and we’re looking forward to celebrating in the stands (and not storming the field) when they do. We’re hoping the Crimson can channel Fenway’s other red-clad team to strike a win against the Bulldogs. If they do, attending the Game will have been more than worth it, and we at The Crimson have much faith in the Crimson’s ability to pull it off.
Ultimately, the Game is a chance to unwind and make merry before we all go off to celebrate that other great New England-based tradition, Thanksgiving. In that spirit, we urge our fellow students at Fenway to stay safe and have fun.
This staff editorial is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In my sophomore year, the Women’s Center was always a space of comfort and healing. Despite being in the basement of a building, surrounded on all sides by brown-red earth and its darkness, I found beams of light there in hot tea, a collection of books, welcoming smiles, and couches where I could sit and unwind. Take down my guards. Breathe easily. The ground around its walls seem to hug me in rougher moments.
Last semester, the Women’s Center chose to honor Judge Rosemarie E. Aquilina as part of their #WomanCrushWednesday series. Aquilina had presided over the case against Larry G. Nassar, the doctor who committed acts of sexual violence against 160 survivors on the USA Gymnastics team. When the guilty verdict came in, Aquilina called his sentence of 40-175 years in prison a “death warrant” and later made comments implying that, if cruel and unusual punishment were constitutionally permissible, she would have him experience the same sexual violence that he had committed against the survivors.
When I saw the picture of Aquilina on the Women’s Center’s wall — soft smile, hair tied high into a slightly messy bun, white lace collar peeking out from under her robes of authority — this didn’t sit right with me. Why was the bondage of a human being for the rest of his life being celebrated? Why were they endorsing the retributive spirit behind Aquilina’s sentence? Why was the Women’s Center, a space of uplifting and healing, reinforcing and honoring systems and structures that subjugate and oppress the communities I am a part of? The underground walls suddenly felt constricting.
Aquilina’s decision fits into a broader justice system that uses prisons to solve society’s social issues. I don’t need to inundate you with the horrors of life in prison, or trace the historical lineage from slavery to prisons, or give you the statistics of how the prison-industrial complex is built to subjugate people of color, specifically black people; these arguments have been well researched and well articulated. I hear testimonies from those who have experienced the prison first hand — experienced the injustice, trauma, torture, hopelessness — and it becomes increasingly clear to me: The existence of the prison is a moral failure. We know that we were not meant to put people in chains. We know that torture as a form of punishment reveals our darkest parts. We know that people are people no matter their worst actions. And still the social landscapes that we have helped to construct and uphold reveal a cognitive dissonance.
On top of that, people who are imprisoned for violent crimes like rape and murder are often victims of violence themselves, and by using the prison — hotbeds of physical, psychological and sexual brutality — as punishment, we complete and strengthen a cycle of violence that is self-reinforcing. When Aquilana made the claim that she would allow “someone or many people to do to [Nassar] what he did to others,” she must have known that by sentencing him to a life in prison this might happen to him. And who does this cycle of violence help? What issues does it solve? The solutions we have in place are not only morally bankrupt, they serve to worsen the problems they claim to remedy.
So how do we move forward? Liberal ideology espouses the idea that prisons can be made better, that these institutions can be “fixed” in some way to be more humane and tolerable. However, the act of reforming still normalizes bondage, makes dehumanization easier to swallow, and serves to absolve us of our collective guilt around imprisonment. Working within the confines of this social landscape, we forget that the existence of the prison is in fact not inevitable, and that we, through our actions — for example, honoring the retributive spirit around Aquilina’s decision — legitimize its existence every day. We can and must challenge ourselves to think more creatively: How can we work towards a vision for a better world — a world without prisons?
Angela Davis was one of the first people to ask me this question. In her book “Are Prisons Obsolete?”, Davis calls into question the apparent permanence of the prison as a fixture in our social landscapes. The existence of the prison, she argues, is a shortcoming of our imagination and represents our willingness to disappear the problems that plague our world into buildings we never see or have to think about, rather than work collectively to fix them. Davis writes: “The most difficult and urgent challenge today is that of creatively exploring new terrains of justice, where the prison no longer serves as our major anchor.”
So what does this world without prisons look like? For me, this world is one that is committed to healing and rehabilitation based on the recognition of the full humanity of every individual. Rather than locking people up in response to criminality, a practice that destroys individuals, communities, and the moral spirit of those who do the incarceration, we can use restorative practices to heal what has been broken and to come to the best possible outcome for all. A world without prisons restores power in communities, building up, rather than tearing away, their members. A world without prisons works to ensure universal basic income, housing, and healthcare, recognizing that crime is inextricably linked to structures of poverty. A world without prisons builds upon social welfare systems to ensure no one falls through the cracks.
Obsoleting the prison is then an inherently positive project. This past summer in Chicago, I worked as a community organizer to mobilize three neighborhoods to invest in developing a community mental health center which would provide free mental health services to residents in the area. Chicago is a city that habitually locks up its residents suffering with mental illnesses in jails and prisons, which made the development of this center vital in envisioning a future without prisons. While the work I was doing had very little to do with the structure of the prison itself, it was still grounded in a vision of a social landscape that prioritized alternatives to human bondage. Through rooted actions like these, we can begin to provide salient, practical, and moral alternatives.
Beyond the confines of our imagination, a world without prisons is possible. I see it and the walls around us all expand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the concentration declaration period for sophomores now over, two major trends acting in opposition stand to change the face of Harvard. Concurrent with a decline in the humanities comes a rapid expansion of applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, arguably detrimental to higher education, learning, and more broadly, the world.
Often lovingly referred to as a “small liberal arts college in Boston,” Harvard has historically dominated the social sciences and the humanities, even as peer institutions have emphasized computer science and engineering.
Meanwhile, courses such as Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” have in recent years experienced drastic increases in enrollment. Reporting by The Crimson last year revealed that from 2008 to last year, Computer Science rose from 86 concentrators in 2008 to 363 last year, and Applied Mathematics more than doubled in its count.
Additionally, English and Comparative Literature concentrator numbers have decreased significantly in their counts. Undergraduates might today be hard-pressed to find peers concentrating in these heavily humanities-centric fields.
Therein lies the troubling issue: The foundation of study which has historically made Harvard what it is is dying. And that is an issue which needs to be addressed.
Certainly, this isn’t an isolated incident. According to The Atlantic, humanities fields across the country, increasing history and English, have decreased in major counts in recent years.
And yet, as the single most prominent institution of higher education, it remains up to Harvard to determine the future. If the percentage of humanities and social science concentrators continues to decline, that trend will undoubtedly be reflected across the nation. If Harvard doesn’t take initiative in promoting these fields, it can be expected that no one else will, either.
To claim that the University is the most important institution in promoting education reform would be presumptuous. However, should Harvard, now under University President Lawrence S. Bacow, enact proper action promoting those studies which have experienced a marked decline, we may very well encourage other institutions to follow suit. Bacow’s recent listening tour was carried out with the intent of reaching out to peer universities, looking to establish mutual pathways of development. Traveling to his birthplace of Detroit, he met community members and argued for the importance of higher education.
The benefits of promoting the humanities and social sciences are numerous. Creativity, logical thinking, and reasoning are all necessary life skills, and proper communication is imperative to excel in professional environments. And, after all, those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. Without scholars understanding economics, government, and sociology, the foundations of our society have no basis.
It’s undeniably great that Harvard has an updated curriculum providing students with important knowledge in computer science and engineering, but to ignore other fields is to ignore the very foundations of our culture, our society, and our existence.
There’s a frequently-used joke about the uselessness of non-science, technology, engineering, and math fields. Engineering is commonly touted as the end-all be-all for a successful career, and the liberal arts are seemingly only useful for research and scholarly purposes. Economics is for “snakes,” English is for secondary school teachers, and gender studies is totally and utterly useless.
Maybe they’re all right. Maybe science fields ensures the highest chance of a stable, post-undergraduate career, and maybe the humanities are ultimately useless. But life is about more than that — it’s about financial stability and economic portfolios, of postmodern traditionalism and normality.
To current freshmen: Don’t give in to the pressure. Don’t think that you need to take CS50 to be successful, don’t think you need to concentrate in economics to make money, and don’t think that everyone can (or should) try to follow the same path to success. Because in the end, we only have one life to live — live it as you desire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Julia M. Huesa ’20 will lead the student body as Undergraduate Council president and vice president in 2019, the UC Election Commission announced Thursday evening.
The duo garnered roughly 41.5 percent of the vote total, easily beating out second-place finishers Nadine M. Khoury ’20 and Arnav Agrawal ’20, who received 26.6 percent of the vote, according to an email sent by the commission to College students. Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 and Samyra C. Miller ’21 finished in third with 20.6 percent of the vote, followed by John T. Ball ’20 and Sabrina Wu ’20, who dropped out of the race last week but remained on the ballot.
"It's so surreal,” Palaniappan said in an interview Thursday evening, surrounded by fellow students who worked on her campaign.
Huesa said the results left her unable to fully articulate her feelings.
“I still feel like I haven't registered it,” she said. “I still feel pretty normal, but it's one of those things where you don't realize that it's happened until later.”
Palaniappan and Huesa — who will take the reins in December from current UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 — ran under the slogan “make Harvard home.”
The duo proposed offering funding for some undergraduate social events and called for the creation of cultural climate committees across all academic departments to bolster Harvard's capacity to address sexual assault allegations. The Government department created a committee earlier this year to evaluate departmental culture in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct against Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez.
This year’s election saw significantly increased turnout from the 2017 race, with 2,797 students casting ballots. That figure represents a roughly 35 percent increase from last year’s turnout.
Earlier this semester, the Council changed its voting method to a Borda vote count, a ranked-choice method in which each candidate receives a quantity of points corresponding to their ranking on the ballot — first-choice tickets received one point, second-choice tickets received 0.5 points, and third-choice tickets received 0.33 points.
Olivia K. Bryant ’21, a member of the Harvard Open Data Project, which polled students about the race last week, said in a Wednesday interview that the new voting method could potentially lead some undergraduates to vote in a more strategic manner. But given the margin of victory for Palaniappan and Huesa, the voting system likely did not change the election’s outcome.
This year’s winners are both longtime members of the UC.
Palaniappan, the Council’s education committee chair, has organized student town halls about proposed changes to shopping week and spearheaded legislation to fund faculty-student dinners. Huesa, who serves as vice chair of the Council’s Student Relations Committee, has participated in efforts to establish a multicultural center on campus.
Palaniappan said she and Huesa plan to work on improving the Council’s communication with the student body in their first days in office.
“I think from the onset, better structuring the way we communicate with students I think is something that we need to already set the tone and plan for,” she said. “I think we're going to work on it before we even leave for break and just get off the ground running.”
Huesa said she hopes to increase the diversity of the UC, a push that she noted would need to begin shortly, given the Council’s spring elections occur in mid-February.
“I think recruitment for midterm elections will also be really important because there's a lot of underrepresented communities on the Council so far and people just generally don't know what they can do on the Council,” she said.
Huesa added that she would work to ensure that the Council’s identity caucuses are fully “instituted” by the beginning of next semester.
Zhang said in an interview Thursday that she is “excited” for Palaniappan and Huesa to begin their term.
“It’s going to be an amazing, challenging, and learning adventure,” she said. “And I have full confidence in them.”
Boucher agreed, saying he was eager to see what the duo would accomplish during their tenure.
“I think they’re an exceptionally deserving ticket, and I cannot wait to see what they will do over the coming months,” he said.
Before the results were released, Ragheb — the only presidential contender who had not previously served on the UC — said that campaigning for the student body’s highest office had been an “amazing experience.”
“All three tickets would do amazing things after being elected,” he said. “I think all three tickets, and we especially, generated a lot of enthusiasm on campus for something that people normally don’t turn out for.”
Ragheb and Miller’s loss represents the 22nd time in the past 23 UC elections that outsiders have fallen to tickets with previous UC experience.
Voters also weighed in on two referenda in this week’s election, after the Council decided to place them on the ballot at its meeting last Sunday. The first — which calls on Harvard to divest from the “fossil fuel industry” — won support from 71.5 percent of voters. That figure is virtually unchanged from 2012, the last time students voted on the issue. In that election, 72 percent of students voted in favor of fossil fuel divestment.
James H. Coleman ’21, co-president of Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice, which campaigned in support of this year’s referendum, called the results “encouraging,” especially in light of the 2012 vote.
“That really shows that the student body still has a really strong sentiment for divesting from fossil fuels,” he said.
Responding to the referendum, University spokesperson Melodie Jackson wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson last week that Harvard would not change its investment strategy with respect to fossil fuels, but remained “committed” to tackling climate change in other ways.
“The commitments made in Harvard’s Climate Action Plan explicitly recognize what the science has made clear: the world must move quickly to end its use of fossil fuels,” she wrote. “While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it.”
The second referendum on the ballot, which urged the University to divest from the “prison-industrial complex,” garnered 77.2 percent of the vote.
Asked in October whether Harvard would consider divesting from prisons, University President Lawrence S. Bacow reiterated what his predecessor, Drew G. Faust, repeatedly stated throughout her tenure: the endowment is not the appropriate mechanism to effect social change.
“The University should not use the endowment….to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said. “There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley emphasized in an email to College affiliates Wednesday that the Boston Police Department will have ultimate jurisdiction at the upcoming Harvard-Yale football game — and he told students to stay safe at this year's Boston-based iteration of the Game.
The 135th rendition of the Game will be played Nov. 17 at Fenway Park instead of its usual location at Harvard Stadium.
Boston Police will have primary jurisdiction in the areas surrounding Fenway Park — the home of the Boston Red Sox — while Harvard Police will be stationed on the University’s campuses. In Riley’s email, he wrote that HUPD is “fully committed” to providing a “safe and secure campus” in Cambridge and in the Allston and Longwood neighborhoods of Boston on Friday and Saturday.
Riley said HUPD and Boston Police have a “strong working relationship” and engaged in “numerous discussions” leading up to the Game. He said Boston Police requested attendees respect the rules of the park, abstain from consuming alcohol underage, and take public transportation or Harvard-run shuttles to the event.
“Any violations of Park rules or laws will come under the jurisdiction of Fenway Park Security or the Boston Police Department,” Riley wrote.
Riley said attendees who violate Fenway Park’s rules or Massachusetts laws will be ejected from the park or arrested.
The College’s amnesty policy — which grants intoxicated students under 21 exemption from University punishment in certain cases — will remain in place during the football game, according to Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise.
The policy dictates that students who approach Harvard employees to seek medical assistance for themselves or for intoxicated friends will not be punished for underage drinking. Employees include Harvard University Health Services professionals and College residential life staff. The policy does not cover inappropriate or illegal actions students commit while drunk, and the College cannot prevent local or state authorities from arresting students for other crimes.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email last week that one “HUPD command-level supervisor” will be stationed at Fenway to liaise with both Boston Police and Fenway security officers. Riley wrote that information about a student who “comes to the attention of Boston Police or Fenway Security” will be passed to this liaison.
“It is my hope that those who travel to Fenway, representing Harvard College, have a safe and enjoyable time at The Game,” Riley added.
Harvard University Health Services administrators also sent an email to College students Thursday reminding them to hydrate and eat throughout the weekend.
Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services, and Garrett O. Fitzgerald, director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, encouraged students to practice safe alcohol consumption by pacing themselves while drinking and alternating alcoholic beverages with water. They also urged students not to mix alcohol with substances such as marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit drugs.
“We hope that you are safe, that you look out for those who need it, and you have fun as a Harvard community,” Barreria and Fitzgerald wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students got into the competitive spirit at Harvard-Yale Spirit Week, a series of events meant to generate pre-match excitement ahead of this year's iteration of the Harvard-Yale football game Saturday.
Spirit Week, an annual tradition hosted by the College Events Board, kicked off with a Chili Cook-Off in the Science Center Plaza and will close out with the dance party, “HYsteria,” open to all Harvard and Yale undergraduates Friday night.
The Crimson Traditions Committee of the CEB is in charge of organizing Spirit Week events in order to rally school spirit in preparation for The Game, according to Joseph H. Zuckerman ’19, a member of the committee.
“We really tried to have a diverse range of events this week to just kind of get the whole student body involved,” Zuckerman said.
One such event, the “Bulldog Roast,” took place in the Smith Campus Center on Thursday night. It featured performances from on-campus comedy groups Stand Up Comics Society and On Harvard Time..
Andrew J. Berry, a lecturer in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department, gave a lecture entitled, “Why Harvard is Better Than Yale.”
In his lecture, Berry called Yale’s mascot, a bulldog, “an anatomical disaster” with “physical deformities.”
Berry also joked about The Game’s controversial move to Fenway Park.
“Sorry folks, that’s where you’re going to be,” he said. “That’s if you make it out" of the Science Center tailgate, he added.
Last fall, Fenway Sports Management announced that The Game would take place at the Red Sox’s home field in 2018. This will mark the first time since 1912 that the match has been played at a location other than the Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl.
Some students have voiced their disappointment with the move and have drawn rebukes from College Deans for attempting to sell their tickets.
According to Zuckerman, The Game’s move to Fenway Park influenced CEB’s approach to planning this year’s Spirit Week.
“I think we definitely wanted to give the students something special this week because people are a little bit upset about Fenway,” Zuckerman said. “So it’s definitely gone into the thought process of trying to get peoples’ spirit back up and give them something fun going on the week before The Game.”
Other comedy groups at the “Bulldog Roast” also poked fun at the move to Fenway.
On Harvard Time presented a video in which Yale students mistakenly assume that they will be playing Harvard in baseball.
“So you’re telling me we learned an entire new game for nothing?” one “Yalie” asks in the video.
Despite the jokes, some students said they were excited to attend The Game at Fenway.
Rachel L. Ma ’21 said she preferred travelling to Fenway over travelling to New Haven.
“I think last year being that it was at Yale, it was a lot more difficult to go first thing in the morning,” she said. “I’m actually excited for it to be at Fenway and in Boston this year.”
Apurva Kanneganti ’20 said she hoped Harvard would gain the edge over Yale in the Ivy League Football Conference.
“The fact that we’re actually tied in the conference with Yale right now gives me some hope for Saturday,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five student organizations convened a panel discussion on mass incarceration in Emerson Hall Thursday that emphasized why students, regardless of their background, should join efforts for prison reform.
Panelists included activists and academics who examine the conditions of many U.S. prisons. Douglas Rogers, founder of Black and Pink — an organization representing BGLTQ prisoners that advocates for an end to the prison industrial complex — and Arthur Bembury, executive director of The Partakers — a mentorship program for prisoners pursuing college degrees — spoke from the perspective of former prisoners now working towards reform.
Christine M. Mitchell, a Harvard School of Public Health student, spoke about her work with DeeperThanWater, an environmental justice coalition that works to improve living conditions in prisons. The three panelists and History and Literature Lecturer Emily K. Pope-Obeda spoke to more than 50 students and prison reform activists about their research and advocacy on issues related to the prison system.
Co-sponsored by Harvard College Project for Justice, Harvard College Act on a Dream, Harvard Black Students Association, Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, and Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, the discussion — called "America in Chains: A Panel Discussion on Mass Incarceration" — aimed to bring issues of mass incarceration to campus conversation.
“Mass incarceration is an issue that’s easy to become disconnected from, but it’s one of the most pressing issues of our generation,” Leonardo A. Garcia ’21 said. Garcia, who helped organize the event, is the intersectionality co-chair of Act on a Dream. He said he hoped the talk would “catalyze energy to work towards reform.”
Organizers intentionally invited a diverse set of groups to the event, Garcia said.
“This campus has a lot of organizations that work towards similar goals, yet there’s not enough coalition building a lot of the time,” he said. “This event is really showcasing intersectionality and the power of coalition building.”
Diversity featured prominently in the panel discussion. Panelists said the effects of mass incarceration are felt by a wide range of communities, which is why all students should get involved in reform efforts.
Bembury called prison reform the “new Civil Rights Movement.”
Two of the panelists, Rogers and Bembury, were formerly incarcerated, and Garcia said “destigmatizing” incarceration was another goal of the event.
“I want students to see them for who they are: incredible assets to their community in ways that prisoners are not frequently viewed,” he said of Rogers and Bembury.
The event took place the same day students at the College voted on an Undergraduate Council ballot referendum asking whether the University should divest its “holdings in the Prison-Industrial Complex.” In the final tally, 1,984 students voted for the measure, with 584 voting against.
In an October interview ahead of the student vote, University President Lawrence S. Bacow reiterated administrators' long-standing stance against using the endowment as tool for activism.
"The University should not use the endowment... to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said.
Christie A. Jackson ’21, one of the event organizers and a member of Harvard Project for Justice, said that while the event was not deliberately timed to coincide with the UC election, she was happy it was held while the issue was at the forefront of campus discourse.
Two of the panelists mentioned Harvard’s divestment as an important step towards wider reform.
“If Harvard divests from prisons, that is national news. We need to make that happen,” Mitchell said.
Members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign were present at the panel, and said they felt the discussion was important in raising awareness for their cause.
“When they were discussing how to get involved, a lot of the panelists gave local examples, even on Harvard’s campus. If we push Harvard to divest, that is one way to fight this fight,” Salma Abdelrahman ’20, the organization’s co-president, said.

Conservative and liberal pundits took to the stage at the Institute of Politics’ John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday night to participate in a lively panel discussion of last week’s national midterm elections.
The “Post Midterms: Looking Ahead” panel featured high-profile political figures, including Michael Glassner, executive director for President Donald J. Trump’s re-election campaign; Beth Myers, former presidential campaign manager to Mitt Romney; and Stephanie Schriock, president of feminist political action committee EMILY’s List.
IOP Residential Fellow Amy K. Dacey, former CEO of the Democratic National Committee, also contributed to the panel. Maria Teresa Kumar, founding president of Voto Latino, joined in a Skype call. The event was moderated by ABC News Political Director Rick Klein.
The panelists advanced dueling analyses of the recent election cycle, in which Republicans extended their majority in the Senate and Democrats won the House of Representatives, along with key gubernatorial seats.
On the Republican side, Glassner downplayed Democratic gains in the House, placing the midterms within a broader political and historical context.
“The number of seats lost by a party that controls the executive branch was more or less in line with what has happened historically,” he said.
In contrast, Dacey argued that Democrats did not expect to win the Senate, but that the House victory marked a significant change in the political landscape surrounding the Trump administration. She also emphasized the impact Democratic political success will have on the state level, fundamentally altering the electoral map for the 2020 presidential election.
“One of the untold stories too is all of the significant chambers we were able to flip in the state legislatures,” Dacey said. “That will have a significant impact on building a national campaign.”
“I don’t underestimate how difficult it will be to run against Donald Trump, but I think these victories and winning in some of these places will have an impact on the map in 2020. It’s a different map,” she added.
Fellow Democrat Teresa Kumar cited high voter turnout as predictive of future Democratic success, especially among young voters. She expects to see similarly high turnout in 2020.
“One in six voters...were first time voters,” she said. “This was the highest midterm participation in over a hundred years.”
Republicans, on the other hand, rejected the idea that Democrats’ gains in the midterms were a barometer for the 2020 election, pointing to notable differences between midterm and presidential elections.
“The Trump phenomenon in 2016, I think, was due to Trump himself being on the ticket, which wasn’t the case this time,” Glassner said.
“Midterm elections are much more about tactics,” Myers said. “Presidential elections are all about storytelling… [Trump] knows how to deliver a message. He knows how to tell a story, and he will, by the way, use the Democrat House as his foil.”
Though Myers is Republican, she said her party has a problem when it comes to women.
“We have to figure out a way to tell every woman — white, brown, black, young, old — that they have a place in the Republican party,” she said. “I think that is a place that perhaps the Trump administration has not done as well as they could have done.”
Democrats on the panel said they were heartened by their party’s embrace of female candidates. Schriock, who arrived late, said she believes the first female president will be elected within her lifetime. “I don’t know if it’s going to happen in 2020 or '24 or '28, but it is coming in our lifetimes, we’re going to see it,” she said.
Gabrielle Y. Schultz ’21 said she was impressed by the quality of the discussion.
“I really appreciated how civil they were when they were addressing each other,” she said. “I think it’s because they’re mature adults.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After many students received an anonymous email Thursday accusing the Undergraduate Council’s election commission of being “biased,” the Dean of Students Office emailed students to state that they had independently confirmed the results of the UC’s presidential election.
The DSO sent its email to students roughly a minute after the election commission announced the vote tallies for the election. The email affirmed that Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Julia M. Huesa ’20 had won the election, adding that students could “reach out” with any questions about the Council’s “voting platform.”
Kate Colleran, senior director for Student Organizations and Resources at the College, could not be reached for comment late Thursday about why the DSO decided to send the email — a step the office has not taken in recent presidential elections.
The anonymous email accusing the commission of bias questioned the election commission’s decision to not penalize a campaign for allegedly violating a Council rule about meetings with club members. According to the rule, candidates are allowed to meet with board members of student groups, but cannot share their intention to run with the general membership of the club until campaigning officially begins.
In a 5-0 ruling issued on October 27, the commission decided that the accused campaign’s actions did not warrant a penalty, because they did not “intend” for non-board members to learn about their plans to run for Council leadership.
“It is our opinion that, while this is concerning and that the rule banning the release of campaign information was broken, we believe that this is not grounds for removing this possible ticket from the campaign or the ballot,” they wrote.
The commission did, however, urge the ticket to be “more careful” in their future meetings with student organizations.
“We do, however, warn and admonish X and Y about their conduct,” the commission added. “They should be more careful about their interactions with student groups and be more cognizant of the distinction between interviews about issues and campaign meetings.”
The election commission did not appear to take a hands-off approach throughout the entire campaign, though — the commission imposed at least four penalties on at least two tickets. Penalties included a $15 deduction from campaign funds for an infraction relating to campaign posters, and a mandate that a ticket take down its website temporarily after it published the website prior to the campaigning period.
Boucher rebuffed the anonymous emailer's accusations of bias Thursday, adding that the election commission’s members had been elected to their positions by a unanimous vote of the entire Council earlier this fall.
“I categorically believe that there is no bias inside of the election commission,” Boucher said. “I think that there was a pretty good vetting process for getting people onto this commission, and I have no reason to believe that they deviated from the rules whatsoever.”
“In fact, I actually think they followed the rules much more closely than previous election commissions,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the attacking centerpiece in coach Tommy Amaker’s inside-out offense, junior forward Chris Lewis has stymied opposing big men throughout his time with the Crimson. His adept footwork, ambidextrous ability to finish hook shots from both sides of the rim, and powerful 235-pound frame has made him the premier big man in the Ancient Eight. Earning Ivy first-team accolades in his sophomore campaign and leading the conference with a 60.1 field goal percentage, the Alpharetta. Ga., native has topped the Crimson scoring sheet in the first three games of the new season.
To further analyze the specific positional role that Lewis occupies on the court, I broke down two recent games, the Nov. 9 home loss against Northeastern and the Nov. 13 road victory over UMass, focusing on where Lewis positions himself on the offensive play, how his presence affects the shot selection of his teammates, and how Lewis affects overall team scoring efficiency.
For the sake of succinctness, I have merged both games into one data set. Lewis played about nine more minutes against Northeastern (30) than he did against UMass (21), but tallied around the same numbers in both games. Against Northeastern, Lewis went 7-of-9 from the field for 17 points while the forward shot 8-of-11 for 16 points in the Minutemen contest.
HOW DOES LEWIS SET UP OFFENSIVELY?
Although most skilled as a back-to-basket, “traditional” big, Lewis is nevertheless the main screening man in Amaker’s offense. When matched with starting four Danilo Djuricic or bench contributor Robert Baker — both stretch bigs who often leave Lewis as the sole interior player, Lewis must oftentimes venture out to relieve pressure on the guards.
Here, I divided Lewis’s offensive role into four categories: Post (occupying a low, interior position around the painted area), Screen (setting a pick(and/or roll) on the backcourt ball handler), Transition (operating a fast-break offense immediately out of the backcourt without getting into a offensive set) or Other (neither gaining a stable inside position nor setting a screen, other miscellaneous plays).
Unsurprisingly, Lewis anchored himself in the paint around half of his possessions. The Crimson prefers a slower, methodical playing style, as shown by its meager 68.2 possessions per game so far this season. This rate puts them at number 311 out of 353 teams in terms of pace of play.
With Lewis on the floor, Harvard ran a transition offense in only 14.3 percent of its plays.
WHERE DOES LEWIS GENERATE HIS SCORING?
Over the two games, Lewis was the final Crimson ball holder in 23 total possessions, of which he converted 15, missed five, and turned over three. Despite needing to set a high screen in 28 total possessions, only three resulted in Lewis shot attempts with two made baskets.
Lewis shot at a 70.6 clip in the post position over the two games, generating 27 points from that area of the court. Having only scored six points in non-post sets, Lewis depends on securing himself in the trenches to contribute offensively to the Harvard team.
HOW DOES LEWIS AFFECT TEAMMATE SHOT SELECTION?
When Lewis was on the court, the majority of non-Lewis shot attempts came in the form of the three-point shot. Out of 66 total possessions, the Crimson committed 11 turnovers as well as five non and-one trips to the free throw line. Of the remaining 50 “shooting” possessions, 30 were from beyond the arc. Harvard shot 43.3 percent from deep when Lewis was on the floor and 46 percent from the field as a whole. 
The rest of the Crimson logged the most points when Lewis initiated a screen, with 29 non-Lewis points. In this category, Harvard converted on 12 out of the 17 possessions. Comparatively, the non-Lewis Crimson went 10-of-21 when Lewis set up offensively in the post, combining for 25 points.
TAKEAWAYS
Not a surprise, but Lewis scores almost exclusively out of the post and very rarely generates his own offense out of the pick-and-roll. The rest of the team, however, was very effective the past two games in scoring off a Lewis screen.
In drawing attention to the interior, opportunities are generated on the perimeter for three-pointers. The Crimson almost never attempts a mid-range shot when Lewis is on the floor with only five total jumpshots the past two games.
Overall, with field goal and three-point shooting percentages in the forties, Harvard has been pretty effective with Lewis on the court. Continuing to score at a high clip when Lewis is brought out of the paint will be critical to diversifying the offense beyond the Lewis post-up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“So many things had to fall right,” Frank Champi ’70 said. “That was really interesting to me, how critical everybody’s part was in that whole drama at the end. It was a true team win, shall we say.”
In 1968, Harvard football pieced together perhaps its most famous “win” in the program’s 146-year history. Down 29-13 late in the fourth quarter, the Crimson rallied for two touchdowns along with a pair of successful two-point conversions to tie perennial rival Yale. This result marked the eighth and final stalemate in the 135-year-old rivalry.
In a game replete with action and lore, Champi seems to be correct in noting that there are legions of unsung heroes for the Crimson — teammates like Kenny Thomas, for instance, who knocked the onside kick off a Yale return man, delivering the ball back to Harvard so Champi could lead his squad downfield once more.
However, also missing is what happened around the game, in all the years leading up to it and in all the many years since. Athletes like Champi and teammate Vic Gatto ’69, who caught the touchdown pass from Champi which positioned the home team to knot the game at 29, are frozen in history at 20 or 21 years old. What led them to this moment? Where did they go after departing from Harvard?
Champi and Gatto were each the products of humble beginnings growing up near Boston, and the pair had strikingly similar career paths after leaving Harvard. Though The Game of 1968 forever intertwines the duo, there is much more to these gridiron stars than meets the eye.
This game garnered perhaps the most attention of any Harvard–Yale contest to date. Each side entered the game, hosted at Harvard Stadium, at a spotless 8-0 and looking to tie a ribbon on a perfect season by beating its archrival. Yale was led by quarterback Brian Dowling, who had not lost a game he had finished since eighth grade. The Bulldogs also featured halfback Calvin Hill, a skilled ballcarrier who would end up a first-round selection of the Dallas Cowboys. The Crimson was far less heralded, though it was intent on proving false the narrative heading into the matchup.
Champi was born and raised in Everett, Mass., a working-class city just outside of Boston. He seems glad to have grown up when he did, in an age when he did not have to specialize in one sport to advance to the collegiate ranks.
“It was part of life back then, playing on the playgrounds,” Champi recalled. “And of course in those days we could go to playgrounds without parents looming over us, paralyzed in fear that someone might steal us.”
Champi nearly started his competitive football career off on the wrong foot, however. Between seventh and eighth grades, in the summer before football tryouts, he came down with a severe case of pneumonia and was hospitalized. To pass the time, he read sports magazines that his parents would bring him, and by the time he was discharged from the hospital, he had decided he wanted to be a fullback for the Everett Junior High football team.
During tryouts, he faced yet another setback with a groin injury during a running drill. Thinking he was inevitably going to be cut, Champi was surprised when the coach — the father of former Everett High School head coach John DiBiaso — kept him on. Weeks later, the elder DiBiaso was looking for a backup quarterback, and Champi volunteered to throw some passes.
“He says to me, ‘Well, come over here,’” Champi remembered. “He put his hand up against mine and I put my hand up against his, and my hand was much bigger than his hand. He said, ‘Okay, you’re a quarterback.’”
Everett has a storied football tradition, and that was no different when Champi rose to prominence at the high school. When he quarterbacked the varsity team during his junior and senior seasons, the team did not lose a single game. During his senior season, he began receiving recruiting letters from Ivy League schools, most notably Princeton and Harvard. At first, he verbally committed to Princeton because of its location and the school’s persistence in recruiting him.
“There are only seven trees in Everett and all seven of them are in the cemetery,” Champi said. “I just wanted some room.”
But ultimately, the star quarterback landed at local Harvard. Bobby Leo ’67, who graduated ahead of Champi at Everett High and was a standout for the Crimson and later the Boston Patriots, helped spearhead the effort to woo Champi. Champi relented, feeling he owed it to the Leo family and the other Harvard recruiters.
Gatto grew up not too far away from Champi in Needham. He came from a family that had a tradition at Harvard — his father attended the College and went on to the Business School, while his uncle graduated from the Medical School. However, his was not a typical Harvard legacy family. Gatto’s grandfather immigrated from Sicily and ran a corner store in Inman Square. Gatto’s father and uncle took turns taking leave from school to help the other financially so they could each graduate.
“My father obviously had a little bit of prejudice about where I might go,” said Gatto of his college football recruiting process.
Though he would say his father was an impressive athlete, Gatto recalled that his father was not able to partake in sports himself because he had to work from the time he was five years old in the corner store straight through his years at Harvard.
“My dad used to take us out back and then also take us to the beach, wherever we were, and he’d make us catch passes what seemed like endlessly, but it wasn’t,” Gatto said. “It was just his way.”
Gatto’s father translated his own lack of an athletic career into a passion for supporting his sons. Aside from the ceaseless drills on the beach, the elder Gatto had a passion for Harvard football before his sons even started college, and once they got there he would station himself on the roof of the stadium, taking photos among the rest of the photographers. Earlier on, his father coached the Pop Warner team in Needham, where Gatto pushed the boundaries of the league’s 110-pound weight limit.
“It was funny,” Gatto mused, “my father and the coach from Wellesley sort of fighting over the scale as I just barely tipped it at 110.”
Gatto had his first taste of collegiate football when his Needham team faced off against bitter rival Wellesley at halftime of a Boston College game. His brief time at Alumni Stadium would in time lead to a burgeoning career at Harvard, where he and Champi occupied the same locker room, Gatto one year ahead of the younger Champi.
About halfway through the second quarter, Yale led 22-0. The Bulldogs were running away with a game that they largely had been expected to win in the first place. However, head coach John Yovicsin opted for a bold shift in strategy. Yovicsin, a cold, calm leader who traditionally depended on his seniors, deployed junior Frank Champi into the fray at quarterback. Champi and his offense eked out a score before halftime as the junior found Bruce Freeman to cap off a 64-yard drive — heading into the locker room, Harvard no longer saw a goose egg on its end of the scoreboard.
Though the 1960s marked a notable time in Harvard football history, those years were fraught with other concerns, both at home at Harvard and abroad. The Vietnam War raged on, and the football team and the college as a whole were deeply intertwined with the war from a variety of angles.
Gatto, a resident of Quincy House who landed in the History Department after bouncing around social science majors, recalls that the war brought on waves of anxiety but also created a lot of activity and debate among disparate groups around campus.
The football team was no different from the student body as a whole. Two members of the team were part of the Students for Democratic Society, or SDS, a “rabble-rousing, very anti-war group” according to Gatto. Another had recently returned from deployment in the Battle of Khe Sanh, and another still was part of the campus ROTC program.
In the spring of 1969 — after this game occurred — a student strike ended up canceling finals. SDS had entered University Hall, removed a dean, and barred the doors, citing concerns over the war, the school’s ROTC program, and Harvard’s expansion into vulnerable nearby neighborhoods in Cambridge and Allston. Despite the unrest across campus, the football team remained a cohesive unit. The above players, split by the organizations they were part of, all occupied spots on the defense and never appeared to clash.
“They were friends, even though they had very different views,” Gatto said. “And in those years nobody really agreed with the war, including the guy who had to go fight it, but he still had friends over there fighting and — bluntly — dying, so there was no way he could understand or agree with people who were so negative that they accused the guys coming back of being traitors.”
Gatto recalled the student who returned from Vietnam being spit on at the airport in San Diego when he returned from his deployment. It was tough for people to draw a hard line between the war itself and those who were unfortunate enough to have had no choice but to fight. Many of those who fought were not affluent and thus could not afford to be in college and avoid the draft.
“I’m very serious about the fact that it never was an issue,” Gatto maintained. “Everybody was able to step back and realize that we had a different mission. It was more important to us to do well and focus on our team than it was to have to worry about political discussions in the middle of all of that. There was plenty of time to do that back at the House with your roommates. You didn’t have to do it while you were on the football team.”
Champi reinforced Gatto’s claim of the team’s solidarity. The quarterback, despite his interest in history and politics, tried to remove himself as much as possible from the ever-present debate and discontent on campus at the time. In contrast to what the team and the rest of the Harvard student body saw on the nightly news, football served as a release, and once one crossed over the Charles into Allston, the stress and anger and frustration with the war subsided to a degree.
“To have a successful team, you not only have to have ability and drive and focus and all that other stuff, but you also have to like your teammates so you’re all on the same page,” Champi said. “If you’re working with people you don’t like, you might be at odds. You might try to sabotage each other.”
Campus sentiment around the 1968 team was lukewarm during much of the regular season, perhaps due to the political activity engrossing the student body. But interest grew immensely as The Game neared. On the Friday before the momentous contest, a group of recent football alumni approached the Harvard Band, which was playing fight songs near Dillon Field House, and asked if the group would be interested in leading a pep rally. Bobby Leo and former captain Don Chiofaro ’68 championed the effort.
“We knew that was going to be one hell of a game,” Leo recalled. “I mean everybody was hyped for this game the next day. And that [pep rally] still lingers in my memory as one of the significant things, one of the fun things until we got to the next day and that was mind-blowing — the game, The Game.”
Gatto recalls a rally, perhaps Leo and Chiofaro’s, perhaps a different one altogether. As the team boarded a bus that would bring it to a Framingham hotel for the night before the game, about 200 students crowded around and cheered the team’s departure.
“Only in that kind of setting could you get 200 Harvard people to do anything that didn’t involve canceling classes,” Gatto said.
The Game, and the days leading up to it, appeared to be morphing into an escape for Harvard affiliates beleaguered by the constant tensions of the war and resulting ideological clashes on campus. Add that to one of the most highly-anticipated Harvard–Yale matchups ever, and you had a recipe for a memorable game even before the opening kickoff sailed through the brisk November air.
“That game seemed to change everything,” Champi said. “It’s like everybody unbuttoned the tight vests and let their emotions out … during that game and afterwards too. It was like something changed momentarily.”
Harvard continued to build off the glimmer of success Champi saw at the close of the second quarter. Though starter George Lalich got another chance at the outset of the half, he was quickly replaced by Champi again. The teams traded touchdowns, Harvard scoring in the third on a run by Gus Crim ’70 and Yale answering in the fourth when quarterback and captain Brian Dowling kept the ball himself to break the plane. With less than a quarter of action to go, the deficit was still 16.
Champi and Gatto arrived at the 1968 Harvard–Yale game at the culmination of divergent paths. On one hand, Gatto was a senior and the team’s captain, an emotional leader who filled the pregame void left by the relatively aloof John Yovicsin and his staff. On the other, Champi was a junior backup quarterback stuck in a rut behind senior starter George Lalich, having been limited to brief garbage-time minutes in 1968.
Champi even considered quitting at times during his tenure in Cambridge, recalling that he was frustrated with his situation and wanted to focus more of his energy on preparing for life after college.
During his freshman year, Champi struggled to keep up with the academic demands of the College, becoming discouraged and plummeting down the freshman team’s depth chart. Eventually he became acclimated as he switched his course of study from History to English, but football still flowed on, unrelenting.
Champi and the rest of the team dealt with an extremely difficult and demanding schedule during football season. The players would cross the river around 3 p.m. and not return to their rooms until 11 at night. Getting taped and warming up bled into a two-hour practice, which was extended when players had to get in extra repetitions after the final whistle. A quick break for dinner at the Varsity Club was allotted, and then it was back to team meetings — all this despite Harvard’s desire to decrease the time commitment that athletes made to their sports.
“If this is de-emphasizing football, it must be 24/7 at the big schools,” Champi remembered thinking.
Gatto had what appeared to be a somewhat smoother path. The halfback excelled on the freshman team and on the varsity squad for which he was a starter both his sophomore and junior seasons — a rarity under Yovicsin. According to Champi, he was a respected — and sometimes feared — team leader who excelled at bringing the team together as one.
“Everybody who came in, almost everybody, thought they were going to be a star,” Gatto said. “We were going to Harvard, we weren’t going to Notre Dame, and most people had been a team captain or they had been all-league, some cases all-state. We had a lot of talent, but you’ve got to whittle it down from 110 people.”
Just like these two players, Harvard and Yale were to occupy the same playing field but followed significantly different routes to land at Harvard Stadium that day in the fall of 1968. According to Gatto, in the preseason the Crimson was picked to finish as a bottom-of-the-barrel team in the Ivy League.
“I spoke at the Yale victory dinner my junior year after they had gone undefeated in the league and won the Ivy League Championship,” Gatto said. “I told them that we were going to go undefeated. Of course nobody in the Yale audience believed me, and I continued that — what appeared to be absurd — statement throughout the offseason and then again in the preseason. I know nobody believed me among the reporters I was talking with, but nonetheless it was my belief so I stuck with it.”
Leo noted that the Harvard offense was not nearly as highly-touted as Yale’s in the 1960s, but the Crimson had a formidable defense. The implementation of a passing offense allowed the Harvard squad to escape its previous “three yards and a cloud of dust” billing and set the stage for Champi’s heroics to come.
Both Gatto and Leo described Champi’s arm as tremendous. Leo touted the young field general’s ability to lay the ball into a receiver’s hands accurately and softly. Gatto, on the other hand, recalls Champi tossing the ball from one goal line to the other during warmups. The junior quarterback had a cannon for an arm, but short passes and runs would be the vehicles that guided the Crimson back into contention.
Until Champi entered the game in the second quarter, it appeared as though Gatto’s Yale audience and the reporters with whom he had spoken would have the last laugh. But once the junior quarterback, fear in his eyes, took the field, all that changed. Though Harvard had to severely limit its play selection because of Champi’s lack of practice with the first team, it was able to successfully advance the ball with the help of numerous turnovers courtesy of the Harvard defense’s stellar play and the Yale offense’s inability to secure the football.
“I felt like I was a lamb being thrown to the lions for slaughter, which actually was a good thing. It was the best attitude to have because I was nervous initially,” Champi said. “A few plays into it, I basically said to myself, if I can use a French term here, ‘F*** it. I’m going to play the best I can.’”
Fast forward to the Crimson’s final drive: the team had clawed back to a 29-21 score with a touchdown and a conversion by Gus Crim. Harvard had also remarkably recovered an onside kick because Yale deployed its typical return unit, replete with players who were not known for their hands, instead of a specialized crew.
Down at the seven yard line, Champi scrambled and opted to throw the ball away on first down, leaving just about three seconds on the clock. The Crimson would have time for one last play. Gatto, dealing with a hamstring injury, ran a route opposite fellow receiver Pete Varney ’71, both of whom were draped by defenders. Gatto moved right to left across the end zone, and finally he waved his hand.
“It was as though I was looking through a tunnel at him and he says the same as he looked at me because we had perfect vision to each other, and he let it go,” Gatto said. “There was the benefit of all those times when my father threw the ball to me in the backyard. There it was, coming right to me, right into my chest, and we’re 29-27.”
After the referees and police managed to clear the field of rabid fans, Champi lined up with his team to attempt another two-point conversion. Varney ran a curl route into the end zone and had plenty of room to haul in the pass and tie the game up, delivering Harvard the “win.”
Though Champi and Gatto had taken the field at Harvard Stadium on that fateful day in the fall of 1968 under different sets of circumstances, they both exited as champions.
The comeback and the ultimate tie are ubiquitous in Harvard sports lore as well as in the greater landscape of collegiate football history. Though the Ivy League is not the bastion of elite football programs it once was, this edition of The Game lives on as a testament to many things, most notably the love of triumphs — even those that can only be classified as moral victories — especially those of the underdogs.
As the 29-29 tie concluded the 1968 football season, both players’ playing careers quickly dissipated. Gatto, in his words aided by the stature of Calvin Hill within the college football ranks, received offers to sign as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings and the Dallas Cowboys. He turned both down.
Sensing that the 1968 Harvard–Yale game was a fitting end to his playing career, Gatto opted to start coaching. The recent graduate began at a prep school in Concord, Mass., where he was also a history teacher and during which time he pursued a Master’s degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Then he got his big break. Carm Cozza, the Yale head coach who was at the helm during the tie game, reached out and recommended the former Crimson captain for the top job at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine.
Champi likewise curtailed his playing career after the game, realizing that football did not make sense to him much given Vietnam and the trajectory of his own life.
“For me, when we tied it up I had a tremendous sense of calmness and relief, like a large balloon of frustration got pricked,” Champi said. “And I felt justified. Personally I felt I proved myself.”
“It really made you focus on what the meaning of life was,” Champi added. “What am I doing here? There were people I went to high school with who went to Vietnam. A few of them died. These poor people are in dirty filthy ditches and dying and losing limbs and we’re playing a sport.”
Champi, who graduated a year later than Gatto with an English degree, followed a strikingly similar path at first. He returned to his former high school in Everett to serve as a backfield coach and a teacher. Champi then enrolled in the Graduate School of Education, obtaining a MAT to teach English. The former quarterback returned to coaching and teaching for a while, bouncing around from Everett to Lunenburg to Melrose.
After a few years of that, Champi decided he needed a career change. Realizing that he preferred working with his hands, he left teaching to work in the emerging technology industry in the early 1980s, ultimately landing as a Senior Applications Engineer at Mitsubishi.
In retirement, Champi has combined a passion for history, literature, and mechanical pursuits. He has developed and patented two products — one a foot pedal that attaches to snow shovels to alleviate pressure on the back.
“The last thing people want to think about is shoveling snow,” Champi noted. “So the moral of the story is if I had to do it all over again, I’d try to come up with an idea … that involves sports or whatever people enjoy doing.”
Meanwhile, Gatto kept on with his coaching career. At age 25, he became the youngest head coach in the nation at Bates. An unexpected lunch with the college’s president led to a job offer when the selection committee remained at a standstill, weighing Gatto against another candidate. Along with his responsibility leading the football squad, Gatto was in charge of the faculty advising system and the minority student programs on campus.
“The summer after my fifth year, I was out fishing on the lake I lived on in Maine — very nice lifestyle up there — and my wife came to the shoreline and started screaming at me,” Gatto recalled.
The athletic director from Tufts was on the phone, offering up the head coaching job. Gatto’s wife, a fellow resident of Needham, was anxious to get back to Boston, so Gatto and his family moved back to Boston for six years. After turning around a Bates program that had lost 25 consecutive games before his arrival, he was handed the keys to a more potent NESCAC program with a larger recruiting base near Boston.
Finding more success at Tufts, Gatto made the move down to Davidson in North Carolina, but his tenure there was short-lived as the program decided to transition down to Division III. Like Champi, Gatto sensed the need for change and as a result made a transition to the energy industry. He first collaborated on a project with a company run by Harvard and MIT graduates to safely dispose of radioactive waste in Oak Ridge, Tenn. — a location where some of the Manhattan Project work was completed. Then, Gatto returned to Boston and created a renewable energy company that he runs to this day.
Champi and Gatto have each returned to Harvard–Yale games over the years. Gatto teamed up with fellow captain Dowling in the late 1980s and early 1990s to do color commentary of The Game alongside a local play-by-play man such as Bob Lobel. Thus, two illustrious Harvard football careers are neatly bookended.
“The first time I touched the ball freshman year I returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown, and the last time I touched the ball as a Harvard player I caught what I would euphemistically call the winning touchdown pass,” Gatto said. “So I had a good career and a very fortunate one.”
Though the pair’s paths have again diverged — as Gatto has remained in Tennessee, Champi has stuck around the North Shore, and each has moved on from coaching and teaching — the quarterback and receiver are forever intertwined in the program’s history. Yes, they did connect for one of the most meaningful touchdowns in Harvard football history. But they each accomplished a great deal on and off the field before, during, and after their time at Harvard.
Snapshots of young Champi and Gatto endure in the consciousness of Harvard football fans, but the two are not defined by their black-and-white photos in newsprint, instead moving above and beyond their place in the Crimson’s most famous victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine yourself walking down Brookline Avenue in Boston’s Fenway neighborhood. You climb the David Ortiz Bridge which spans the bustling Massachusetts Turnpike below, and as you look to your left, you see the hulking mass of green which is the exterior of Fenway Park.
You continue across the bridge, making your way past the Cask ’n Flagon and crossing into the historic ballpark through Gate E on Lansdowne Street. Before you step across the threshold, you peer up at the towering rear facade of the Green Monster.
Climbing a flight of stairs, you near closer and closer to the grassy expanse within. Finally summiting the last step, you gaze out beyond the concourse and the left field grandstand to see two sets of yellow uprights standing tall above the surface.
Fenway Park is of course a stadium that has primarily been used for baseball since 1912, but this weekend it will play host to an equally historic gridiron battle between Harvard and Yale. The 135th playing of The Game will take place at a site other than Harvard or Yale’s campus for the first time since 1894.
“I’m certainly looking forward to it because it’s the Harvard–Yale game,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “If our kids are really excited about playing at Fenway, I’m really excited about playing at Fenway.”
In the weeks leading up to The Game, the ballpark has been abuzz with activity. Dave Mellor, Fenway’s head groundskeeper, has had to organize an ever-evolving staff to convert the baseball field into one suitable for football. He utilizes a full-time staff of four, a seasonal crew, and a contractor — Dennis Brolin, who was formerly in charge of the New England Patriots’ complex, and his company, Sports Turf Specialties — to handle the various aspects inherent in a field conversion.
“[Brolin’s] crew helps us with conversions and big projects like this and does great work,” Mellor said. “Depend[ing] on the day, there will be 20-plus people out there and some days there will be … 30 people. It just depends on the day and what scope of work is being done that day.”
For Mellor and his crew, the process began with removing the pitcher’s mound that usually occupies a prominent position in the infield as the only raised surface on the field. Next, the entire infield and any other clay surfaces are covered with a filter fabric so as to avoid cross-contamination from the sod. Sod is then layered over the clay to create a completely grass-covered playing surface.
Mellor echoes safety and playability, as it is a priority of his and Fenway’s ahead of The Game. Unlike during the Notre Dame–Boston College game in 2015, the bullpen walls out in right field are now removable. This allows for more space behind each end zone and allows more room for players to slow down before potentially coming into contact with walls. The weather also factors in heavily to a field’s safety and playability — as of Thursday, there was rain in the forecast in the days leading up to the game.
“You just never know with Mother Nature,” Mellor said. “We have two great weather services, and then everyone involved from the crew to our contractor just really stresses attention to detail and takes pride in what they’re doing.”
Though Harvard football players are likely unfamiliar with Fenway’s playing surface, one former member of the Crimson, Bobby Leo ’67, can attest to the rain’s impact on a grass field. Leo was selected in the seventh round of the 1967 NFL draft by the Boston Patriots and played for the team in 1967 and 1968. In a game against the Buffalo Bills at Fenway in 1967, Leo took a punt back 43 yards before stumbling in the mud which coated the field.
“The field was great, except the first game I played there,” Leo said. “It was raining and muddy. I was returning kickoffs and punts mostly, but I was able to get in for some offensive plays.”
Innovations in field turf may curtail some of the slippage this weekend. With developments in the production of rolls of sod and groundskeeping improvements from the 1960s to today, players can count on a more reliable field surface that is more resistant to the elements.
“Technology’s come a long way through the years,” Mellor said. “The sod is big-roll sod. It’s four feet wide and up to 35 feet long. Each roll weighs up to a ton. That’s less seams. It’s just a heavier, better quality sod for better safety and playability.”
The field will need to measure up on Saturday, as a mix of rain and possible snow could impact the Boston area starting on Thursday night and extending into Friday morning. Though Harvard will have played two games on grass this season including The Game, the team has not been able to practice even once on grass, a first in Murphy’s 32-year head coaching career.
“We haven’t practiced once on grass this season because of the coincidence of really bad weather in the two weeks we’ve had it,” Murphy said. “In the Brown game we had sort of torrential, heavy rains that made the field really unusable, and the same thing has happened again.”
Murphy and his staff have considered hosting off-site grass practices at fields that fare better in the rain, but they decided it was not worth the investment due to the players’ jam-packed schedules.
“I always say to our kids, ‘Whatever the conditions are, it’s up to us to adapt, to evolve and figure it out, and that’s what we’ll do,’” Murphy said.
Mellor, who relishes special projects like this one because of the ability to create memories for a wide range of audiences, says that Harvard–Yale at America’s Most Beloved Ballpark will be a memorable experience.
“Fenway has an incredible aura to it to begin with,” Mellor said. “The history of this game, to be played at Fenway, I think just adds to that experience for everybody. I think the Harvard and Yale fans are some incredible fans and we’re proud to have them at Fenway.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been 106 years since the college football’s second oldest rivalry was played somewhere other than the Yale Bowl or Harvard Stadium. The 135th rendition of The Game will buck that trend, showcasing a contest between the two oldest Ivy League institutions across the Charles River at Fenway Park instead.
The two squads enter the contest with nothing but pride on the line. Harvard (5-4, 3-3 Ivy) and Yale (5-4, 3-3) are far out of the running for an Ivy League title — even runner-up is out of the question.
For both teams, the title ramifications aren’t the important thing.
“To me it’s always about pride,” coach Tim Murphy said. “Pride in our program, pride in our team, pride in our school. I think pride is a very important thing. What we believe in, what we feel about our school, our team, the other guys in our program, it’s all about pride.”
Both teams look as though they’re peaking at the just the right moment. The Bulldogs’ season began atop the Ivy League Preseason Poll and then cratered a mere week later. In a disaster of a contest against Holy Cross, the New Haven squad gave up a 14-point lead to the home team in the fourth quarter, forcing an overtime that would eventually allow Holy Cross to capture the season’s inaugural contest.
Buffered from that loss by two wins was Yale’s 41-18 loss to Dartmouth — the same Big Green team the Crimson lost to by seven. The only other loss that sticks out on the Bulldogs’ ledger is a seven-point loss to a mediocre Columbia team — a Lions team Harvard beat by 34.
The Columbia contest may be the exception for the Yale football team. The match was the first start by junior quarterback Jimmy Check, who entered in the third quarter of the Penn game following starter Kurt Rawlings’ injury in the third quarter. Not able to score but managing to cling to the lead, Check earned the nod in the Columbia game. He hasn’t gotten the nod since.
Freshman Griffin O’Connor started the next contest for the Bulldogs. After a 436-yard, four-touchdown performance in the team’s victory over Brown, the rookie has cemented his place at the helm of the offense. In only two starts, O’Connor has been deadly, racking up 907 yards and seven touchdowns to his name. In the last two contests (against Brown and Princeton), Yale has averaged 44.5 points.
For reference, the Crimson’s quarterback, senior Tom Stewart, has 1302 yards and 11 touchdowns through eight games of play.
“As a freshman to step in facing the injuries — Kurt Rawlings getting injured — and then him earning that starting spot, [O’Connor] has stepped in impressively,” captain Zach Miller said. “We’re definitely game planning for him. He’s got a big arm, he can pose really well, so we’ll try to get some pressure on him and just kind of rattle him a little bit.”
Injuries have plagued the Bulldogs at more than just the quarterback position. In the same Penn tilt that Rawlings was injured, so too was sophomore running back Zane Dudek. The then-freshman scored once against Harvard last season but tallied a game high 64 yards on the grass.
The hole in the offense left by the sophomore has been filled by junior running back Alan Lamar. However, Lamar’s not so much filling a gap, as the offense has shifted to a more pass-heavy front with the introduction of O’Connor.
“Their depth is tremendous,” Murphy said. “Statistically [the injuries] may be an upgrade. It’s crazy. They’re a very deep, talented team. They play a lot of guys on both sides of the ball. They’ve got a lot of team speed. I think the strength of the team is they have another really great offensive line, and they’ve got two great receivers. The passing game for Yale is probably the best it’s been in 10 or 15 years.”
As with any successful quarterback, O’Connor has some weapons on the wings. Junior wideout Reed Klubnik is the most dangerous, standing just 88 yards away from a Bulldogs’ season-record in receiving yards with 1,052. The junior also boasts nine touchdowns and an average of 7.6 catches per game.
Another junior, JP Shohfi, lines up alongside Klubnik for the one-two punch through the air. Shohfi has five touchdown grabs to his name and averages six catches per game. He scored the initial touchdown against the Crimson in 2017 to earn Yale its first lead of the game — a lead the Bulldogs never lost.
Harvard has its offensive weapons as well, its most prominent being sophomore back Aaron Shampklin. The second-year leads the Ivy League in rushing yards with a clean 1,000. His patient running allows holes to open, before his quickness pushes him cleanly through gaps. The back is averaging more than 100 yards per game.
Shampklin isn’t the only competent ball carrier. After suffering an earlier injury, 2017 first team All-Ivy League running back Charlie Booker has taken snaps in the backfield, as have two other sophomores: Devin Darrington and B.J. Watson. Together, the rotating group of four present a quartet that has yet to be substantially silenced.
A lot of the praise for the backfield is redirected to the big men up front.
“The offensive line is the most improved unit of our team,” Murphy said. “It’s a line of scrimmage game. It’s what’s up front that counts. Having an offensive line where you can run the football certainly makes it a lot easier to throw the ball. The three seniors all have become, through a lot of hard work, All-Ivy caliber guys. Tim O'Brien at left tackle, Ben Shoults at center, and Larry Allen Jr. at right guard. Those guys have played great football, really consistent football and it’s just made us a much better offensive football team.”
Saturday’s contest is shaping up to be a battle between the Bulldogs’ explosive offense and the Crimson’s proven defense.
Throughout the season, Harvard’s crown jewel has been its defense. However, while that unit leads the division and is fourth in the nation in third down defense, Yale’s offense paces the division — and is second in the nation — in third down conversions. The Crimson also tops the division in first downs prevented, while the Bulldogs have the sixth-highest yards per game in the FCS.
Above all else, though, this is The Game.
“We’re itching to play,” Miller said. “We’re itching to get on the field and I know they are too, but we’re excited to get a little revenge. They’ve had a pretty good season this year, not as good as last year but they’re a good team. They’re still the same Yale team, same attitude, and they’re going to come out with the exact same intensity as they always have. It’s going to be a great game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor’s note: This column continues a yearly tradition in which sportswriters on The Harvard Crimson and The Yale Daily News write dueling articles in advance of The Game. The column written by The Yale Daily News can be found here.
It’s hard to get to Yale.
Yale students, be sure to read that carefully. It’s hard to get there, not so hard to get in. Of course, you could drive if you’re coming from a reasonable distance, but if you’re from anywhere outside of a six-hour radius that trek becomes unreasonable.
Most people fly, but even if you fly, there’s not really an airport close to New Haven. Some people fly to LaGuardia and then take either a train or a two-plus hour shuttle ride through New York traffic.
The Hartford airport — if you want to call it that — is closer, but still just far enough that it’s pretty unreasonable to take an Uber, though your driver would probably give you five stars for taking the lengthy trip. If you choose to do that, you’re stuck footing a $60 (that’s like eight Felipe’s burritos), 45-minute Uber from the city to the campus in addition to the cost of your plane ticket. Compound that with the $73,180 cost of attendance for a worthless degree (ranked 1270th by The Economist, yikes...) and getting to Yale is just unnecessarily expensive.
Boston, however, has an airport — like, an actual one. For some strange reason, people tend to build airports in places people actually want to go.
Despite the ease of access to Cambridge, the Yale football team has opted to forgo a plane ride and instead limp into this week’s penultimate contest. Look at the roster and look at the box scores. Even accounting for injuries that have recently plagued the squad, this isn’t the same Bulldog team of the last two years.
In fact, this year’s team is reminiscent of those Saybrook College students from two years ago, standing naked on the stadium walls in the freezing cold: they don’t quite measure up.
No question, last year Yale was nice, but this week the Bulldogs will be making use of a backup’s, backup's, backup quarterback. Junior starting quarterback Kurt Rawlings — author of Harvard’s 2017 loss with 177 yards and a touchdown in the muddy contest — bowed out for the season after suffering a leg injury against Penn.
Sophomore running back Zane Dudek — who led the 2017 rushing onslaught, earning one touchdown and 64 yards — has battled injuries all season. The second-year hasn’t been dished the ball since the team’s contest with Columbia on Oct. 27.
Even Yale’s captain is a backup.
All in all, the Bulldogs might be the only thing coming out of New Haven that is more in shambles than the students’ social lives.
Harvard, on the other hand, has sophomore Aaron Shampklin in the backfield. Oh, by the way, he leads the Ivy League in rushing. The second string back? Senior Charlie Booker, 2017 first-team All-Ivy running back. Behind him sit two dynamic sophomore backs, Devin Darrington and BJ Watson. That’s four solid running backs.
Harvard’s defense? It’s third in the nation on first-down defense and fourth on third-downs.
Use whatever metric you want: Rhode Scholars, Nobel Prizes, Ivy League championships, presidents, famous alumni, respective height of mountains for which the school serves a namesake, acceptance rate, Supreme Court justices, pop culture references, people from any random country that have heard of you. Harvard wins. Every time.
Look, I get it, understanding things is hard. Perhaps you’re the Poopetrator and you can’t figure out how bathrooms work. Perhaps you’re the Sports Board of the YDN and you can’t figure out how to write a smack talk column. Perhaps you’re the Yale football team and you can’t figure out how to win more than two years in a row. Perhaps you go to Yale and you don’t understand basic math.
In any case, the writing on the wall is clear, assuming you can read. Harvard will win tomorrow’s football game and Harvard will always win, at everything. Why?
Because Harvard is simply better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor’s note: This column continues a yearly tradition in which sportswriters on The Harvard Crimson and The Yale Daily News write dueling articles in advance of The Game. The column written by The Harvard Crimson can be found here.
For weeks and weeks, I had been preparing to take the LSAT in November. I studied and practiced. I was excited and nervous. But most importantly, I was ready.
That is, until I realized the test was this weekend. Now, instead of taking the exam, I will be doing quite possibly the opposite: venturing north into Fenway Park for one last go at “The Game.”
Skipping the LSAT for just one football game begs the question: what does it mean to live in the present? Is it disregarding the before, disregarding the after, and only focusing on the now? Can we only be present when we forsake our future and neglect all we have done in the past to get us to where we are? Even though this may sound like an apt analysis of my decision-making this weekend, I think being present is just the opposite.
For me, being present is recalling the memories I’ve made while recognizing there is an end in sight; it is intentionally marching — marching on, living life aware of the fact that the past behind us builds and the future in front of us shrinks. It might sound like I am talking about death. In fact, I am talking about something only a modicum less uncertain: graduation. Like death, we tend not to confront the impending nature of graduation. And, in our tendency to intentionally ignore that end in sight, the present can fly by.
Bright College years, with pleasure rife,
The shortest, gladdest years of life;
How swiftly are ye gliding by!
Oh, why doth time so quickly fly?
And that makes sense. When we all arrived at Yale, we had what seemed like an infinite number of college days left.
But one event forces us to remember how ephemeral our time in college really is: the Yale–Harvard football game. Why? Because we all knew, as the leaves changed color and snow covered the ground during our first autumn at Yale, that we only had four chances to attend “The Game.” As a freshman, it reminded us of how little time we have in college. And for seniors, like me, it reminds us of how little time we have left.
Though many seniors, like myself, might still be in denial that the end of college is around the corner, we all know that this is our last Yale–Harvard. The Game forces us to no longer shrink from that end; The Game, therefore, forces us to actually live in the present by highlighting our past and by becoming, in the future, the highlight of our past.
The Game highlights several of our pasts: our individual pasts, but also the collective pasts of our friend groups and even of our institutions. It is a game given import by our institutions’ histories and founded on 318 years of contention — 135 of which have spilled onto the football field. It is given weight by our personal and our friend groups’ collective histories as we travel to Harvard with the same companions we’ve accrued over four years, with whom we have shared three games already. We remember our collective highs and learn from our previous mistakes on these trips — such as taking the wrong bus, which also crashed on the wrong side of Boston; like fitting too many people into one Uber on the way to the hotel we forgot to actually book; like failing to remember, as we freeze in T-shirts in the bleachers, that The Game takes place while trees are bereft of leaves and the ground is frosty white…many mistakes I am sure my friends will repeat.
The seasons come, the seasons go,
The earth is green or white with snow,
But time and change shall naught avail
To break the friendships formed at Yale.
And The Game will matter in our futures as it is, in one way or another, the highlight of our time here. For sports fanatics, “The Game” is the natural pinnacle. Why else is it called “The Game?” But even for those who don’t like sports, The Game is a highlight. It stands out in its uniqueness as an experience unlike any other. It stands out as the one time we are all together in a single, closed environment. And it stands out because it is the only time we come together with another school, and, as a result, form one cohesive and proud unit in opposition to them — think of Harvard holding up its own collective “WE SUCK” sign. Thus, the memories of The Game are ones upon which we will all look back on, whether we’re sports fans or not, as bright points that cannot be dimmed by the refraction of distance or time.
In after years, should troubles rise
To cloud the blue of sunny skies,
How bright will seem, through mem'ry's haze
Those happy, golden, bygone days!
And so, we must make the most of it in the present by remembering our past and acknowledging the future. The excitement heading into The Game is suffused with nostalgia; this moment, a moment that will last forever in our memories, only takes place over two days. We will always remember storming Harvard’s field or stripping naked in the stands, yet it all lasted only minutes. In some weird way, the instant the moment ends, it ceases to be an instance at all. The Game stays with us forever. No matter where we go, nor what lands we travel, nor what seas we traverse, The Game will be a highlight of our “Bright College Years.”
So no, I will not be taking the LSAT on Saturday.
Oh, let us strive that ever we
May let these words our watch‐cry be,
Where'er upon life's sea we sail:
"For God, for Country and for Yale!"

Last time The Game was at Harvard, this Flyby writer can remember hearing “Closer” by The Chainsmokers a solid 10 times over the course of the weekend. What we’re not going to do this year is have boring party playlists, thanks. We put together some of our favorite gameday jams to get you foot-tapping your way to Saturday.
I Like It // Cardi B, Bad Bunny, J Balvin
Honestly, if this song doesn’t play once at a party, it’s not a freaking party. There, we said it. “I Like It” is infinitely danceable, so turn this on if you want your pregame to go from 0 — people standing around and talking — to 100 — everyone jumping and singing, “Oh, he’s so handsome, what’s his name?”
High Hopes // Panic! At The Disco
We’re big fans of Pray For The Wicked, the most recent Panic! album. This song is in case you and your friends aren’t as into rap or trap. And who amongst us doesn’t have high hopes for the football team this year? Harvard beat Columbia… Yale lost to Columbia… you do the math. That’s totally how sports works.
DONTTRUSTME // 3OH!3
It’s always a good idea to toss a ‘00s throwback in your playlists so we can all relive the time we were...preteens. Honestly, though, this electro bop has surprising staying power. If you don’t believe us, put it on at a party and see how many people yell the “I’m a vegetarian” line.
All Star // Smash Mouth
This doesn’t need an explanation, does it? “All Star” is the vibe you hope you and your team will bring to the afterparty. And even if Harvard doesn’t come out on top, the song slaps, and everyone will thank you for playing it. So, really, either way you win.
Like what you hear? Follow our Spotify account, where you’ll find all our playlists. Don’t like it? Tell us about it. Shoot a message to flyby@thecrimson.com, especially if you have ideas for more songs we can include.
