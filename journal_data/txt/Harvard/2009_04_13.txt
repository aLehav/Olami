After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 7, the Massachusetts General Court passed a resolution demanding a drastic reconfiguration of the nation’s current energy policy. The plan calls for replacing traditional electrical generation—which produces environmentally harmful byproducts such as carbon dioxide emissions—with a system that would rely only on 100 percent clean electricity. In light of the dangers that our planet faces in the immediate and distant future, the Mass. General Court’s decision is a wise choice that signifies a keen awareness of the importance of energy policy. 
The plan is notable for containing a set of specific date targets and an organized timeline that lead to completely clean electricity in only 10 years. While the plan is ambitious, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and President Obama should consider adopting the resolution at the federal level, assuming it passes in the Massachusetts House. It is encouraging that the “green movement” has risen to a position of necessary prominence in public discourse, and we are proud that Massachusetts (and Boston in particular) has taken a lead in expanding the national awareness on these crucial issues. 
But perhaps the most interesting thing about the environmental resolution that the Mass. General Court passed last week is that it was the brainchild of a student organization—Massachusetts Power Shift (MAPS). To see students participating in legislation and enacting real change—particularly for the environment—is impressive given the dauntingly bureaucratic process it requires. And, even better, Harvard students played an important role in these proceedings. The Harvard College Environmental Action Committee was actively involved in the MAPS group that worked with legislative officials to make the April 7 resolution a reality. 
We hope that the university follows the students’ example and continues to prioritize green causes. As an appropriate conclusion to an environmentally conscious year, Secretary Chu’s selection as Commencement speaker will reinforce the Harvard community’s efforts in building awareness about climate change, alternative energy, and the environment in general. While Chu may not have the celebrity aura of Commencement speakers of years past, he will undeniably reiterate to Harvard students the importance of active participation in what is perhaps the most important problem the world faces today. The current efforts of Harvard’s EAC and of students in the consortium of colleges and youth organizations that comprises MAPS are truly exemplary, but their ultimate success rests on others taking the same initiative to bring change in whatever ways they can. 
Chu’s address, and, we hope, the future efforts of this community, will do much to encourage the continued involvement of young people in the issues that will, quite literally, shape their world.

Unlike the “Room of Requirement” at Hogwarts, which magically appears when a student is in need of it, the Senior Common Rooms at Harvard never seem to feel like doing much of anything for students. Among other things, the recently released Report on Harvard House Renewal expressed widespread student dissatisfaction or confusion with the Senior Common Room as a component of House life. Ostensibly, every House’s SCR is designed to promote meaningful student-faculty interaction by introducing students to distinguished academics and other prominent members of the Harvard community. But, in many Houses, the SCR remains both physically and academically inaccessible.
Adding to the confusion, the term “Senior Common Room” can be used to refer to both a physical space in the House and the group of distinguished academics and professionals who comprise the membership of a House’s SCR. As the College moves forward in its first comprehensive renovation program in 26 years, it should aggressively address this deficiency in the House system. The SCR currently seems to be suffering from a severe case of mission drift: It is unclear whether an SCR is supposed to serve as a source of academic advising, pre-professional counseling, simple socializing, or something else entirely. While every House is different, it is imperative that, in any new system, the specific role of the SCR is made clear.
In Harvard’s new House system, the SCR should be more integrated into undergraduate life. Students should be explicitly introduced to the SCR when they join a House in March of their freshman year. The concept of an SCR should be explained to them, and resources (whether physical or electronic) should be provided to them in order to help them build lasting relationships with House tutors and sponsored academics.
One of the biggest benefits of the House system is the bewildering array of wonderful quirks that has developed over time and the development of a unique House culture at every residence. Take, for example, Eliot House’s beloved spring formal or Dunster House’s bizarre side gate. But this diversity does not seem to extend to the SCR: All 12 residential Houses seem to have an exclusionary and enigmatic policy regarding this supposedly “common” physical space. Kirkland House, for example, only allows students to use the space by appointment, while Winthrop and Eliot are even more restrictive. After renovations, the SCR should be more accessible to the House as a whole.
Of course, making a few changes in room reservation policies is one thing; comprehensive institutional change is another. Every House should have a tutor, student, or administrator who is charged with bridging the gap between the SCR and its residents. The burden falls upon those who administer the SCR to establish meaningful links between its members and the student population. At the very least, House administrators should make it easier for students to reach out on their own, either through the House website or through their resident tutor.
To some extent, the report addresses our concerns: It calls for the creation of a House fellows program, which addresses many of the shortcomings of the current SCR system. In particular, we are excited about the new program’s mandate that its fellows facilitate meaningful interaction within the House community through lectures, discussion dinners, and integration into the larger network of House advising through liaisons with graduate students. Per the committee’s recommendations, we hope to see the College pilot the House fellows program in one or two Houses and, if successful, require all 12 Houses to participate.

After the Second World War, the world was stunned by the atrocities of the Holocaust and vowed, “Never again.” After Rwanda in 1994, the world was stunned with the slaughter of a million lives and vowed, “Never again.” And now, 15 years later, how does the world respond to a genocide that has claimed the lives of 300,000 people and displaced more than 2.5 million in Darfur? While the International Criminal Court has indicted the president of Sudan, Omar El-Bashir, the Arab League has rushed to support him. This Arab reaction is shamefully self-interested and dangerously lays the ground open not for “never again” but instead for “once more.”
The first question to ask is why Arab countries would take such a stance in the first place. Their position comes down to the issue of self-preservation. Let’s face it—it’s not as if the Arab countries are completely democratic. If Bashir is prosecuted, other Arab leaders fear that they might also be charged with criminal acts against their people. It’s true that, during the Arab summit on Mar. 30, the Arab League demanded that Israeli officials be put on trial for atrocities they committed against the people in Palestine and Lebanon. But this act still does not excuse its exoneration of Bashir.
The Arab League defends its stance by alleging that the ICC is politicized and that indicting Bashir is a cheap shot at destabilizing Sudan and grabbing its resources, particularly oil. Such a claim, free of substantial evidence to back it, seems to be taken from a James Bond movie and appears to be little more than conspiracy theory. Nor is it consistent with the Arab League’s recent decisions—when Lebanon demanded an international investigation and tribunal for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri earlier last month, Arab leaders welcomed the beginning of the tribunal at Lahay and the transfer of jurisdiction from the Lebanese justice department to the international judges. No mention was made of the ICC’s political ambitions then.
All this hypocrisy casts the Arab world in a very negative light. But, while the Arab reaction was perhaps expected, the nonchalance with which the great Western powers have dealt with the matter is at least as disturbing, given their official opposition to Bashir’s acts. Rather than boycotting the Arab summit, Secretary General Ban Ki Moon appeared and delivered only a brief denouncement of Bashir regarding his expulsion of 13 aid groups from the country. Indeed, the Western response has on the whole been lacking. Reaction from world leaders was limited to calls for the Sudanese government to respect the ruling of the ICC, so that Bashir was left to roam freely among the different Arab nations. He even fulfilled his Muslim pilgrimage requirement once the Arab summit was over.
Although it would be foolish for the great powers to intervene militarily in Sudan, they can and should take steps in order to make sure that a criminal does not remain head of state. They can start by placing economic sanctions on Sudan, boycotting its merchandise, and placing an arms embargo on the country. At a later stage, they can sever diplomatic ties with Sudan or call for a G8 summit to discuss further steps. They should not consider a military operation, mainly because it will lead to a very costly long-term commitment. But they should increase the presence of the UN peace-keeping forces in Darfur to ensure that a second genocide does not take place.
While it is a shame that Arab leaders have supported Bashir, it is more alarming to see the Western world’s leaders sit idly by as Bashir roams free, still in power of the people he once massacred. We can only hope that our leaders’ inaction will not lead to another “never again” moment.

The danger of a slippery slope is that you never know when you’re going to fall. As medicine makes further advancements in the realm of pre-natal screening, we must remain aware of the point at which the fight against diseases progresses into an unnatural quest for perfection. 
Earlier this year, in vitro fertilization was used to screen for a faulty BRCA1 gene that increases one’s susceptibility for breast cancer, while researchers at Cambridge University claim that a pre-natal screening for autism will soon be possible. Although both steps seem to represent an innocuous effort to prevent devastating medical conditions, the extended use of pre-natal screening raises many serious ethical questions. 
Autism, for example, should be distinguished from disorders that are currently screened, such as Down syndrome and Huntington’s diseases. It is not a disease, but a spectrum condition that does not necessarily entail suffering. Indeed, autism is often related to remarkable talents—it is believed that both Newton and Einstein were autistic—and selection against the condition can be viewed as a sinister form of eugenics that discriminates against those who are not typical. 
Meanwhile, pre-natal screening against cancer susceptibility presents deviation from the standard practice, as screening has previously only been used against diseases with a 90-100 percent chance of causing a disease that affect the child from birth. BRCA1, however, only raises the risk of the disease from 50-85 percent, while breast cancer itself does not affect the child from birth and has the potential to be cured. 
Both these examples of extended pre-natal screening raise a critical question: At what point does the mitigation of flaws develop into a cultivation of inhuman immunity?
Although screening for autism leads to worries over the removal of all eccentricities from society, autism is nevertheless a condition that affects a child from birth and causes many difficulties. To condemn the screening of autism due to its links with unusual talents, but not screening of diseases such as Down syndrome, essentially values an autistic person’s life above that of someone with Down syndrome. 
Thus, in keeping with current policies on the issue, screening for autism is morally acceptable. Nevertheless, the act is another step towards the sinister world where every abnormality, up to depression, is removed before birth, and as such it should not be taken lightly.
Screening for breast cancer susceptibility is advancement in the same direction. The previous legal boundaries for appropriate screening (a 90-100 percent chance of the disease affecting the child) were violated in this case. As advances allow us to screen for smaller and smaller susceptibilities, firm boundaries must be drawn to keep science in check. Policymakers must consider the range of genes that cause the same level of susceptibility as BRCA1 and evaluate the implications of permitting such extensive use of pre-natal screening. Ultimately, a level of susceptibility for which it is permissible to screen must be determined, and this level should remain fixed. Such limits may be arbitrary and may eventually deny screening for BRCA1, but, at some point, policymakers must draw a line in the sand.
Furthermore, extensive use of pre-natal screening presents a worrying situation in which those with wealth are able to purchase an objectively higher level of descendants than others. Selection of the most attractive traits presents a significant genetic advantage to the wealthy—more so than simply being able to afford a higher standard of medical treatment—and threatens to irrevocably exaggerate the divide between rich and poor. 
In order to preserve the ideals of our society, the cultivation of this super-race should be deterred, and purchasable pre-natal screening and IVF treatment in the name of health should be covered by health insurance by law. Failure to make pre-natal screening practices publicly available has worrisome and immoral implications for the future of society.
Pre-natal screening presents a valid opportunity to combat many diseases, and we are still significantly far from the sinister world of designer babies outlined by cynics and satirists. However, as science allows us to advance further and further in pursuit of perfection, we should be aware of the implications of each medical achievement. Safety checks must be imposed to prevent a loss of balance, as tumbling to the bottom of this particular slippery slope would be disastrous.

“We put the meat on the pole, not on the plate,” proclaims the enlightened slogan of Portland’s first, and only, vegan strip joint, Casa Diablo. Offering the perfect blend of animal-friendly philosophy and female objectification, owner Johnny Diablo aims “to save as many lives as possible and to break down the myths in any way possible” —namely, the myth that a refusal to eat meat compromises one’s masculinity. Labeling his critics “feminazis,” Diablo denies that he is substituting the exploitation of women for the exploitation of animals. “How are we exploiting women?” he declares. “Are we hacking off their limbs? Peeling their skin away? Putting them on a barbeque?”
While Mr. Diablo may have overestimated the purchasing power of Oregon’s vegan chauvinists—he recently put his strip club up for sale on craigslist—other prominent vegan activists display a similar willingness to exchange the objectification of animals for the objectification of women. Typically defended by the weak retort “sex sells,” these endeavors have prompted critics to brand veganism as a sexist ideology—a damaging charge given veganism’s place within a broader progressive program. PETA has unapologetically commandeered the female body to promote its agenda, from its long-running “rather go naked than wear fur campaign” to last month’s London showcase of a pregnant woman, breasts exposed, caged, and on all fours, intended to protest the maltreatment of pigs. And the Vegan Vixens, an animal-activist twist on the Pussycat Dolls, pose for pin-up shots in pleather between appearances at the Playboy mansion and on the Howard Stern show.  
In light of our society’s pervasive equation of meat-eating with masculine dominance, such minglings of the anti-meat agenda with misogyny assume added complexity. The ostensible absurdity of a vegetarian weight-lifter exposes a deep-rooted cultural fiction: that men gain strength and virility through eating the flesh of other mammals. Although, from a nutritional standpoint, meat may do more to clog men’s arteries than to build their muscles, meat retains symbolic power: The slaughter and consumption of animal flesh serves as a means for men to assert their dominance over nature (and, by extension, over women).Historically, acquiring meat was a role performed by men, as hunters, while women, as gatherers, were responsible for obtaining vegetables. Studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship in premodern societies between women’s empowerment and the importance of meat: The more limited women’s economic position as food providers, the more circumscribed their social status. Processing plants may have replaced man in his role as hunter, but he still demands control over the preparation and cooking of meat, most notably through the masculine pastime of “grilling.” An etymological examination further exposes meat as a decidedly non-gender-neutral term. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "meat," in its slang usage, can refer to “the human body (esp. a woman’s body) regarded as an instrument of sexual pleasure,” as well as both female and male genitalia. The less academic, but no less authoritative Urban Dictionary defines meat as both sexual intercourse (with the charming example “I’d like to meet Jessica Alba and then meat her”) and as a derogatory term for freshman girls. A sexy man is a “hunk”; a sexually exploited woman complains of being treated like a “piece of meat.” Meat represents the essence of something: We strive to “get to the meat of a matter”; in contrast, vegetables denote the comatose and the mentally disabled. When used in connection with man, meat is power: It is the life-giving sex organ and the ability to dominate over others, both physically and sexually. Yet, when used in connection with woman, meat implies objectification: The severing of the female from her full emotional self to construe her as an object for male consumption.
Men’s aversion to veganism thus hinges on more than the unappetizing aroma of tofurky: It is grounded in a deep-seated historical, cultural, and psychological framework that conflates meat with manliness and might. By enlisting female meat to distract men from consuming actual meat, the endeavors of Johnny Diablo and his activist peers delve into a more complexly contested territory than the rationale “sex sells” suggests. Pitting the masculine and feminine meanings of the term against each other, they simultaneously exploit men’s anxieties of losing meat as a source of power and reduce women to passive pieces of meat, only satisfying the fantasies of the male viewer. These attempts to redirect men’s energies from eating meat to viewing it are unacceptable. The agendas of animal and female empowerment need not clash. If anything, exposing the objectification of animals is a powerful vehicle for illuminating the objectification of women. Rather than viewing the two causes as a trade-off, vegan activists, in betraying the hegemonic process whereby animals are removed from the idea of meat, should underscore the similar process whereby females are packaged as objects for the male gaze. Without the allure of attractive, naked female bodies, such a project may garner less shock-and-awe publicity. Yet, if vegan activists wish to maintain the consistency of their liberal agenda, they must eschew trading the exploitation of one vulnerable group for the exploitation of another.

The College’s Student Activities Office announced last week that Sarah J. Sidwell ’09 has been selected as the campus’s fifth Fellow for Campus Life, or “fun czar,” for the upcoming academic year.  The fun czar serves as a coordinator for social events around campus. As a member of the Student Activities Office staff and College Life and Activities Group, Sidwell will work closely with the College Events Board to plan events such as Yardfest, the annual welcome-back celebration, and Harvard-Yale weekend festivities.  Sidwell will succeed Jason B. McCoy ’08 to the position on July 1.  For her, getting the position is “a dream come true.”  “I can’t wait to start working with students to plan the most exciting and fun events that we can imagine,” Sidwell said. “I intend to come into this position with enough energy and creativity to honor the amazing ‘fun czars’ who have transformed social programming at Harvard.” Sidwell is no stranger to social coordinating. She has served as Hospitality Chair and Production Chair for the Harvard Concert Commission and as Director of Alumni for the Fellows Program at the Institute of Politics. She currently works in the College Dean’s Office as the Room Reservations Coordinator and serves on the Advisory Board of the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH). “I’ve been a social planner for as long as I can remember,” Sidwell said. “Ever since middle school or even elementary school, I’ve been planning social events.”  Sidwell will work closely with Assistant Dean of the College David Friedrich and Judith Kidd, Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities, to sustain the range of social activities offered to students.“Sarah brings tremendous experience, knowledge, and enthusiasm to this position and we know that her talents will benefit students immensely,” Friedrich said in a statement released by the College.  “I’ve worked with her before on Yardfest,” CEB Chair Kevin M. Mee ’10 said. “She’s a really great, really nice person. I definitely look forward to working with her next year.” Due to the current economic downturn, Sidwell may face financial constraints her predecessors did not.  “It will be a challenge for us to be realistic in tough economic times without sacrificing fun for students at Harvard,” Sidwell said.  The Campus Life Fellow’s position has been in existence for five years, created in 2004 with the appointment of Zachary A. Corker ’04 as special assistant to the dean for social programming. “It has provided us with invaluable connections to our students and student organizations and we look forward to continuing this good work with Sarah next year,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in a College press release.—Staff writer Michael J. Ding can be reached at ding2@fas.harvard.edu.

More than 90 students and activists from Harvard, MIT, and the Greater Boston area hoisted picket signs in Harvard Square on Friday afternoon to protest the incumbent Communist Party’s victory in Moldova’s general parliamentary elections last week.Accusations of electoral fraud sparked peaceful protests throughout the former communist satellite state the day after the election, but the situation quickly escalated to violent riots and retaliations by authorities.By Tuesday, Moldova had reached a state of unrest that remains perilous to citizens and journalists, according to media reports.Friday’s demonstration in Cambridge, organized by members of Harvard Romanian Association and the Romanian Student Association at MIT, occurred simultaneously with protests in Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chisinau, the country’s capital city.“Above all, it’s a collaboration between the students and the people in the Boston community,” said HRA President Rares N. Pamfil ’10. “The organization usually hosts events on campus, and this is something beyond that.”The former soviet state’s Communist Party reportedly won 49 percent of votes on Sunday, April 5, far more than either the Liberal Party or the Liberal Democratic Party, which won 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.International observers cautiously called the elections free and fair, but following the post-election violence President Vladimir Voronin, who is a member of the governing Communist Party, has submitted to calls for a vote recount.Pamfil, a native of Cluj-Napoca, Romania, said he believes that being vocal about the issues in Moldova will improve conditions.“This might be an important turning point for Moldova, an opportunity to actually change things,” Pamfil said. “The West has been slow to push for that. What’s happening in Moldova is one thing, but the voices that come from...Washington are also very important.”Harvard Kennedy School student Bakhtiyar Hajiyev said he attended the rally to show solidarity with Moldova as well as with his home country of Azerbaijan, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.“My country is also facing similar election irregularities and going through the same process,” Hajiyev said. “Post-Soviet countries...we need to support each other.”Pamfil, Hajiyev, and other supporters who were present on Friday emphasized that change requires action, and action requires consciousness.“I think the consensus, especially among the people abroad, is that this is an opportunity to change the government,” Pamfil said. “No action of the communist government is, by itself, obvious enough or violent enough to lead to the concerted international response that is necessary in this situation. We want it over with the Communists. People want to come out and say that.”

Harvard topped yet another ranked list on Thursday­—this time it emerged as the most referenced American university in a Global Language Monitor survey of global media sources.In the two years that the Austin, Texas-based research company, has released this data, Harvard has taken the top spot both times. But this year, it managed to edge out Columbia by only 1.03 percent.GLM’s Predictive Quantitative Indicator tracks references of different American universities in global print and electronic media, including the Blogosphere and social media. Schools are viewed as trademarked brands, with a high PQI value correlating to a high brand quality, according to Paul JJ Payack, president and chief word analyst of GLM. A high ranking is a reflection of how well the university is marketing itself as a brand, Payack said. “When we have a brand, the attributes associated with it are the key things. The same is true with college. When people think of Harvard, people think of certain things associated with the brand,” Payack said. “Quality wins overall. The best quality comes out on top.”The data does not necessarily suggest that the highest quality universities in the country are mentioned more times in the media, Packack warned. But, he said that he was surprised by “how closely the data mirrored the ranking of the best schools in the country, which shows that it has more value than we may have thought.” Data on the types of media outlets or topics that the schools were mentioned in relation to were not released along with the rankings. But Payack said that scandals or sports teams made little difference in determining the final list. “We were concerned that if we talked about media overall that the sports institutions would skew the data in their favor,” Payack said. “It seems that having a dozen or so Nobel laureates creates more buzz globally than do sports teams.”Payack also suggested that the University’s decision to change the John F. Kennedy School of Government to the Harvard Kennedy School may have had some bearing. “It never hurts to find a recognizable name,” said Leighton W. Klein, a Web journalist at the Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy. “It never hurts to cite a University that represents authority and knowledge.”Payack said that Harvard has been successful in branding itself as a University: “all the different schools seem to be telling the same story.”  “In branding, what you want is that each component reflects the brand as a whole. If it is a strong enough brand, all news is good news,” he said.

Student models strutted down the runway in front of a sold-out crowd in Annenberg Hall Saturday night during the third annual Identities Fashion Show, sponsored by the Asian American Association. The models showed off clothes that explored the interplay between fashion and cultural identity, with a focus on the Asian American experience.Three themed acts—Demure Danger, Asian Americana, and Street Culture—exhibited mixes of Eastern and Western styles. Designers from Harvard College, the Parsons School of Design, and the Fashion Institute of Technology showcased their work in two “Student Design” segments.Demure Danger took its inspiration from two trends of the 1920s, the colorful Chinese qipao dress and the freewheeling flapper styles of Prohibition-era New York. One model tossed his bowler hat into the audience as he left the catwalk.The remainder of the show was sprinkled with similar performance elements and flirtatious stunts. In one scene a model handed a male companion her purse while she took off her jacket. She strutted off the stage leaving him on the catwalk, the purse in hand.The Asian Americana segment explored what American symbolism means to the Asian immigrant. Patriotic reds, whites, and blues were accented by Asian twists like martial arts headbands. Some carried books about American history. One model ditched his pants for a pair of star-spangled boxers while Kim Wilde’s 1980s hit “Kids in America” blared in the background.The show concluded with Street Culture, when models exchanged their stoic strutting for hip-hop dancing. The men sported shiny Ed Hardy hoodies, jeans, and hats. Women wore baggy cargo pants and tanktops.“I wanted to show the different styles of Asian street dancing and clothes,” said Moonlit M. Wang ’10, the creative director of Street Culture. During this segment, the models alternated between Chinese, Japanese, and Korean street dance styles. In a high-point of the performance, the audience erupted in applause during a mock dance-off between male and female models.The student designs explored both traditional and avant-garde styles. Xinran Yuan ’10 used puffy textured fabrics which amplified her models’ figures. Helen Tsim ’10 created long, silky dresses that recalled high school proms.With the exception of one fall—an apparent consequence of a precarious pair of high-heels—the show’s execution was generally seamless. “It went smoothly, although it was hectic at times,” said director Nara Lee ’11.“It was amazing display of talent,” said attendee Eveleen S.S. Hsu ’07. “It highlighted the unique aspects of being Asian, but the themes applied to everyone.”All proceeds from the show were donated to Massachusetts Asian and Pacific Islanders for Health, a Boston-based charity that promotes health awareness.

The Undergraduate Council advanced its plans to chime in on a recent University decision to cut programming for the “January Term” at its general meeting yesterday, voting unanimously to approve a policy paper that recommends that the College adopt generous standards for assessing whether particular students are allowed to remain on campus during the January period.  
The Council also approved a question to be posed on the “J-term” issue at a Faculty of Arts and Sciences town hall meeting on the economic crisis scheduled for tomorrow.
The policy paper recommends that housing students during the month of January be defined in a way that allows students to stay on campus to participate in a variety of extra-curricular activities and other programs that are deemed productive. 
The stance is in opposition to what some believe might be an overly restrictive need-based standard for deciding which students can remain on campus in January. A letter about the “J-term” decision sent to members of the community last week by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith suggested that students with a need to remain on campus “may potentially include varsity athletes, international students, thesis writers, students conducting lab-based research, and others who cannot reasonably accomplish their work in another location.” 
The Council’s official question for the Town Hall meeting includes a summary of the Council’s position on the J-term issue along with several questions about the process that will be employed for approval of a student’s stated need to remain on campus in January. 
UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10 said that Council members will be “asking as many questions as we physically can” at the Town Hall.
The Council also voted yesterday to approve a letter to Hammonds inquiring whether a report on the Ad Board set to be delivered to the college dean by a student-faculty committee charged with considering the issue be made public. Former UC President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09 sat on the Ad Board committee and Ad-board reform was one of his campaign platforms when he ran for president last year.
Daniel V. Kroop ’10 said he thought it was important that students see the report so that they could discuss the issues it addresses.
The Student Labor Action Movement, a Phillips Brooks House Association program that focuses on promoting labor rights on campus, also addressed the Council during yesterday’s meeting.
Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09, a member of SLAM, emphasized that the Council is in a unique position to advocate for students to the College administration and that it is important for SLAM to utilize its connections with the organization.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just two years after his inauguration, former University President Lawrence H. Summers penned a 5800 word letter to the Harvard community that left no doubt about what sort of a mark he intended to make: Harvard would build itself into an unparalleled center of interdisciplinary research, and it would do so by undergoing an unprecedented expansion. Thrust into prominence as the canvas for the University’s grand vision was the neighboring community of Allston—a city once dominated by railroad stockyards and cattle slaughterhouses that now bore the weight of a new president’s vision and a centuries-old University’s future.But the city’s newfound standing has not always been greeted cheerily by residents who, in the years since Summers’ first bold pronouncements, have often worried that their voices have been muted in a development process largely dictated by the interests of University developers. The situation was brought to a crescendo in February when Harvard announced that it would be slowing construction of its Allston Science Complex, which has been slated as the first step towards realizing the University’s 50-year development framework. The slowdown left an especially bitter aftertaste in the mouths of local residents and some City officials, who say they sanctioned an accelerated approval timeline for the project only because the University had insisted that the complex was vital to furthering life-saving stem cell research. Now, with the University planning to temporarily house the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in its existing Cambridge campus, residents have come to question the University’s commitment to developing the neighborhood, saying they feel jilted by Harvard’s change of focus.“The Science Complex is a promise that was broken to us,” said State Representative Michael J. Moran, whose constituency includes Allston, Brighton, and Brookline. But the sharp turn of events, precipitated by an unprecedented economic downturn that has wreaked havoc on University finances, has also served to rally diverse community interests around a common cause.“Where I think everyone has really come together lately is to say the Science Complex really can’t be stopped,” said Aaron MacDonald, an Allston-Brighton resident for 11 years. The University has said it will wait to re-examine the Science Complex’s construction pace until year’s end when its fiscal situation is more clear. Some residents see the intervening months as an opportunity to be proactive and encourage the University to address other long-standing neighborhood concerns. But there is no indication that the larger riddle—ensuring that a powerful University’s quest to remake a city does not drown out the voices of its residents—will come any closer to a resolution. A LIMITED PROCESSResidents have struggled for many years to inject their interests and concerns into a development process that does not require community approval for the University’s plans. Allston development projects need only be approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority—a powerful city agency beholden to the Mayor and tasked with overseeing the entire City of Boston’s planning and development projects—in order for them to be implemented.Community members and the BRA did successfully negotiate a cooperation agreement with Harvard last spring requiring the University to provide $25 million worth of benefits to the neighborhood while proceeding with the construction of the Science Complex. The agreement is one of the instances where the BRA has drawn praise from Allston residents for skillfully balancing community concerns with institutional interests, but it has not been enough to allay questions about the group’s ability to be responsive to community needs.The BRA has endured perennial criticism for its political ties and its far-reaching responsibility to oversee many of the key stages of construction projects—an arrangement that the group says allows for cohesion between planning and implementation, but which some feel puts the BRA in a position to subordinate community concerns to developer interests.“[The BRA should] simplify things in a way that’s accessible to any regular person,” said Boston City Councillor Sam Yoon at a recent community meeting in which he advocated for a re-structuring of the BRA’s authority. “Let the community make the tradeoffs.”Proponents of the current structure add that the community has the chance to offer its say through the Harvard Allston Task Force, an advisory panel of local residents appointed by the Mayor to facilitate discourse between the University, City, and the community at bi-weekly meetings.But the Task Force is vested with no legal authority and is often restricted to examining concerns explicitly tied to Harvard’s development plans. “The Task Force is the BRA’s entity. They set the agenda. They run the meetings. It’s not at all in practice an open, community-driven, responsive group—there’s a bounded mandate, a wall inside which it lives,” said Harry Mattison, an Allston resident and Task Force member.SOLICITING INPUTDespite these obstacles, many community members see the Science Complex slowdown as a chance for the Task Force to reinvigorate itself—taking a more participatory role in understanding and addressing larger community concerns, such as leasing issues and development of unremarkable commercial areas such as Barry’s Corner and the Holton Street Corridor. “We need to be proactive for ourselves, not just sitting and waiting while Harvard decides if [it is] slowing down its expansion and planning,” Mattison said. “That doesn’t mean the neighborhood doesn’t exist. There’s still plenty of issues, opportunities to make the neighborhood better.”BRA officials have recently committed to a revitalization of community-wide planning efforts that had been sidelined in recent months due to concern over the Science Complex slowdown. Affordable housing, commercial development, and public open spaces are among the areas currently pegged for consideration.  “We’re asking Harvard to be more forward, to participate,” said Michael F. Glavin, Deputy Director of Institutional Development, at a recent neighborhood meeting. “I don’t think the level of participation was ever anything close to what it should be going forward.” FILLING A ROLEThe BRA had once considered appointing a separate task force to address the community-wide planning process, but eventually decided that the considerations were not technical enough to justify cluttering the existing landscape with another planning committee. Today, the BRA runs the community-wide planning meetings and invites members of the Allston Task Force to participate, given their prominent leadership role in the community.Gerald Autler, the senior Project Manager for the BRA, acknowledged that the current Task Force was appointed specifically to address Harvard’s future institutional campus, and as a result is not necessarily geographically or demographically representative of the entire Allston community—which contains many immigrants and language groups. He said that the BRA has sent out meeting notices in multiple languages and provided translators, but that such opportunities were rarely taken advantage of. “[It’s] always a challenge...but in terms of people who are interested and do want to come to meetings and feel comfortable participating, yeah, I think we’ve gotten a really good turnout and heard from whole range of people,” Autler said. In an attempt to address community planning concerns more inclusively, various neighborhood groups have been created to examine issues ranging from vacant property holdings to zoning laws and transportation to affordable housing and working-class interests. Task Force member Harry Mattison, who serves as a member of the Allston Brighton North Neighbors Forum, said that “the advantage [of our group] is that it’s run by the neighborhood, so we can decide what we want to talk about, when we meet, who’s going to talk, instead of sitting and listening to hours of presentations.”Mattison added that the formation of different community groups is not a “competition” nor a “knock on the Task Force,” but simply the result of “a role that needed to be filled.” But Jake Carman, a founder of the Allston Brighton Neighborhood Assembly, who has been far more critical of the current planning structure than Mattison, said that “you have to question where exactly the power lies” in the BRA’s development process, which he criticized as “incredibly unfair” because the community is unable to vote on the BRA’s decisions. While neighborhood groups such as Mattison’s attempt to “work within the system and the BRA process, trying to get the best community benefits,” Carman said, his group “is more interested in taking the struggle outside the confines of the BRA’s process.”“Our goals aren’t necessarily to take the most crumbs we can from Harvard,” Carman said. “Our goal is to make sure Allston Brighton remains affordable for the working class population.” Ray Mellone, chair of the Task Force, said that not all community groups have worked in the “best interest of the community,” and that some may be motivated by a politically-derived dislike for institutional development.“Some people just want to stay and get angry,” Mellone said, adding that he believed the current planning structure allowed all parties to express their opinions.  Regardless of their neighborhood group affiliation, Allston residents are unified by one common complaint—the lack of transparency in Harvard’s decision-making process, especially when it comes to the University’s leasing of its vacant Allston properties. “If Harvard had communicated to the community from day one, they would have met with a lot less resistance [from the community],” said Aaron MacDaniel, who has been co-writing a new blog that started last month with the purpose of analyzing Harvard’s impact on the Allston neighborhood. Matthew De Remer, who co-authors the blog, said that while he and MacDaniel both look forward to the benefits of Harvard’s presence in the neighborhood, many residents felt “hurt” when they discovered Harvard had been buying many properties in Allston under other company names without community knowledge or input. MacDaniel added that he saw it as “spin and dishonesty” when the University, apparently playing to community concerns that it was leaving property vacant, said 85 percent of its “leasable” property was already leased. The Crimson later reported that Harvard had not yet informed the public that 790,000 square feet of its property was deemed “non-leasable” because the spaces were either unfit for tenants or reserved for University construction plans. The continued presence of empty lots has riled residents already concerned about the slow speed of the development process, some of whom fear that the end of the construction efforts is impossibly far away.“I gag every time I hear 50 years,” longtime resident Leonard W. Kelliher exclaimed at a Task Force meeting in February. “I’m looking forward to a lot of the benefits we’re getting by it. But in 50 years we’ll all be gone by global warming or something. Let’s talk about now, the present. Fill up these empty shacks.”—Staff writer Vidya B. Viswanathan can be reached at viswanat@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two major Harvard teaching hospitals announced Friday that they have adopted an extensive conflict of interest policy, culminating a two-year assessment of hospital ties to the pharmaceutical industry.After over a year of controversy, Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women’s Hospital will now prohibit doctors from receiving gifts from pharmaceutical companies. The Partners Commission on Interactions with Industry policy will also require physicians to report their relationships with drug companies to patients.Further, executives of Partners HealthCare—the company that owns the two hospitals—will face strict limitations on their involvement with the industry and will no longer be allowed to own stock in any of the drug companies they help oversee.However, William D. Hoffman, an assistant professor of surgery at Mass. General, said that these policies do not go far enough to prevent conflicts of interest in industry-funded research.  He said that researchers in academia should have primary control over the data, and that currently many investigators are provided with summary data by the industry and are not allowed to conduct their own data analysis, which is done by the drug company itself. He said pharmaceutical companies might not release data that are damaging to their investigations, and, as a result, hospital investigators might be unaware that they are publishing a study without all the information.But Eric G. Campbell, an associate professor of medicine at Mass. General, said that he thinks that Partners has created a policy that is in line with many other research institutions.Campbell said that this policy change sets a tone and a culture for what kinds of relationships will be accepted. He said that he does not expect to see a shift overnight, however.“These are very resilient cultures,” he said.Campbell said that the influx of students in medical school who are willing to embrace these policy changes has helped lead to the cultural shift.Campbell said that doctors can still meet with pharmaceutical representatives—they will just have to buy their own lunch. He also explained that a major financial fallout will be on physician speakers who are paid upwards of $100,000 to $200,000 to give presentations.“Drug companies do not pay the average physician to give a talk for them,” he said. “They pay the superstars.”He added, however, that certain industry relations, such as those involving research funding, are essential for financing the next generation of drug products.“We have no other mechanism to make drugs,” he said. Campbell added that he thinks it is appropriate for academic institutions to give consulting information to drug companies.­—Staff writer Laura G.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three prominent Boston Red Sox fans discussed the role of baseball in American culture in front of a standing-room only crowd that turned out to the Institute of Politics’ “Take Me Out to the Ballgame!” forum on Friday afternoon.  The discussion, which featured Pulitzer-Prize winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns and baseball television analyst Peter Gammons, focused on the game’s impact on race and family life. They addressed the question of how the sport has taken on a singularly influential place in the American consciousness.Robert Behn, senior lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, directed the proceedings which at times mimicked the atmosphere one might find in a ballpark—audience members wearing baseball jerseys and munching on Cracker Jacks occasionally called out with a boo or hiss.Gammons reflected on the extent to which baseball, whose prominence on the international stage has increased substantially in the past decade, mirrors the melting-pot composition of American culture. He recalled the words of Major League Baseball pitcher Orlando “El Duque” Hernandez, who fled Cuba to play in the United States and later acknowledged of his fellow ballplayers: “We all came over by boat.”“In that way, baseball reflects us.” Gammons said, pointing to the parallel between Hernandez’s characterization and the United States’ immigrant tradition.   Burns, the documentarian, said that he hoped that his Emmy Award-winning film “Baseball” gave viewers “an opportunity to think about race,” citing the development of the Negro Leagues and the debut of Jackie Robinson—who broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947—as events whose significance exceeded the narrow confines of sport.Discussing baseball’s uniquely pervasive standing in American culture, Goodwin and Burns emphasized that the familiar, generational aspect of baseball is key to the game’s appeal. Goodwin recalled her childhood habit of filling out box scores and recreating the game for her father, while Burns argued that stories about baseball, unlike those of other sports, “always begin ‘my mom’ or ‘my dad.’”“My favorite was probably a tie between [Burns] and [Goodwin],” Tyler R. Goin ’09 said of the panelists after Friday’s event. “It was interesting to hear about baseball from them because they’re historians from other fields.”The group spoke relatively little about the numerous revelations of illegal steroid usage that have wracked baseball in the last decade. But Gammons addressed the government’s role in tackling these issues in an interview before the forum.“I don’t think government can regulate sports, but I think they can go after the heart of the underworld issues,” he said, citing the prevalence of steroid use in high school and college athletics. “If they can get to that heart and clean things up...it’s a good thing.”Rose Styron, a resident fellow at the IOP who offers a weekly study group entitled “Art and Politics,” was involved in organizing the event said she considers both Goodwin and Burns longtime friends.Styron hosted Burns at a special study group that preceded the forum.“His eyes are open all the time,” Styron said of Burns. “The world is his oyster, and he makes it delicious for all of us. He’s dealing with all the issues of our time.”—Crimson staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard Medical School have discovered that adult humans do in fact possess a type of beneficial fat—previously thought to only be present in babies, young children, and other small mammals—that burns calories instead of storing them.The discovery was made simultaneously by three independent research teams in Boston, the Netherlands, Finland, and Sweden. Brown fat and its potentially crucial role in warding off obesity has since been the subject of three articles in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.Unlike its counterpart white fat, a mere two ounces of brown fat tissue, if fully activated, could burn an estimated of 20 percent of daily calories, according to C. Ronald Kahn, one of the lead investigators and a professor at HMS.“It doesn’t take very much for brown fat to burn a significant number of calories,” said Kahn, who is also head of obesity and hormone action research at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center.Previously, other researchers had unsuccessfully looked for brown fat between the shoulder blades, where it is located in mice and in human babies, leading to the conclusion that brown fat disappeared as people age. It was widely believed to only remain in “extraordinary circumstances,” such as living in extreme Northern climates or having a tumor in one’s adrenal glands, according to Kahn.“We thought, maybe the reason we’re not finding any brown fat is that we were not looking in the right place,” he said.Analyzing a combination of over 3000 PET and CT scans, the team found trace amounts of brown fat nestled under the muscles in the front of the neck.“This was actually a bothersome thing to the radiologists,” said Allison B. Goldfine, an associate professor at HMS and one of the paper’s authors. “With the new technology that radiologists were using to find tumors, they were picking up something else with similar high metabolic activity—the brown fat.”Because radiologists would not have biopsied the region and endocrinologists were not aware of its existence, this “momentous” discovery was made possible only when the different disciplines merged, said Goldfine, referring to the team of endocrinologists, radiologists, endocrinologists, physiologists, geneticists, and others who worked on this study for over a year.The three independent studies showed that the amount of brown fat fluctuates with the season, temperature, age, and weight. It is also lower in people with high blood sugar levels. The Harvard team also found that women generally had more brown fat.Establishing the presence of brown fat in adults opens up the possibilities for future investigations as to how its usefulness might be harnessed. According to Kahn, he and his team will look into creating a technique to scan for brown fat that is more practical for clinicians.“The bottom line is, if there are ways to stimulate the activity or the amount of brown fat in humans...it’d make a big difference in the prevention and reduction of obesity,” said Kahn.—Staff writer Helen X.

SOLICITING INPUT
Despite these obstacles, many community members see the Science Complex slowdown as a chance for the Task Force to reinvigorate itself—taking a more participatory role in understanding and addressing larger community concerns, such as leasing issues and development of unremarkable commercial areas such as Barry’s Corner and the Holton Street Corridor.

FILLING A ROLE
The BRA had once considered appointing a separate task force to address the community-wide planning process, but eventually decided that the considerations were not technical enough to justify cluttering the existing landscape with another planning committee. Today, the BRA runs the community-wide planning meetings and invites members of the Allston Task Force to participate, given their prominent leadership role in the community.
Gerald Autler, the senior Project Manager for the BRA, acknowledged that the current Task Force was appointed specifically to address Harvard’s future institutional campus, and as a result is not necessarily geographically or demographically representative of the entire Allston community—which contains many immigrants and language groups. He said that the BRA has sent out meeting notices in multiple languages and provided translators, but that such opportunities were rarely taken advantage of. 
“[It’s] always a challenge...but in terms of people who are interested and do want to come to meetings and feel comfortable participating, yeah, I think we’ve gotten a really good turnout and heard from whole range of people,” Autler said. 
In an attempt to address community planning concerns more inclusively, various neighborhood groups have been created to examine issues ranging from vacant property holdings to zoning laws and transportation to affordable housing and working-class interests. 
Task Force member Harry Mattison, who serves as a member of the Allston Brighton North Neighbors Forum, said that “the advantage [of our group] is that it’s run by the neighborhood, so we can decide what we want to talk about, when we meet, who’s going to talk, instead of sitting and listening to hours of presentations.”
Mattison added that the formation of different community groups is not a “competition” nor a “knock on the Task Force,” but simply the result of “a role that needed to be filled.” 
But Jake Carman, a founder of the Allston Brighton Neighborhood Assembly, who has been far more critical of the current planning structure than Mattison, said that “you have to question where exactly the power lies” in the BRA’s development process, which he criticized as “incredibly unfair” because the community is unable to vote on the BRA’s decisions. 
While neighborhood groups such as Mattison’s attempt to “work within the system and the BRA process, trying to get the best community benefits,” Carman said, his group “is more interested in taking the struggle outside the confines of the BRA’s process.”
“Our goals aren’t necessarily to take the most crumbs we can from Harvard,” Carman said. “Our goal is to make sure Allston Brighton remains affordable for the working class population.” 
Ray Mellone, chair of the Task Force, said that not all community groups have worked in the “best interest of the community,” and that some may be motivated by a politically-derived dislike for institutional development.
“Some people just want to stay and get angry,” Mellone said, adding that he believed the current planning structure allowed all parties to express their opinions.  
Regardless of their neighborhood group affiliation, Allston residents are unified by one common complaint—the lack of transparency in Harvard’s decision-making process, especially when it comes to the University’s leasing of its vacant Allston properties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second consecutive year, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team came inches from breaking a nearly two-decade winless streak against Ivy rival Princeton. And for the second consecutive year, the No. 15 Crimson came up just short with a 10-9 loss to the No. 2 Tigers Saturday afternoon at Class of 1952 Stadium.In the dramatic final minutes, the Crimson fell behind 9-6 midway through the fourth quarter before responding to pull within one at 10-9 with 1:16 left. Despite two possessions in the final minute, sophomore Dean Gibbons turned the ball over, and the Tigers cleared it as time expired to secure the narrow victory.Gibbons had the hot hand on the afternoon, posting a hat trick that included two fourth-quarter goals. But the Crimson faced a familiar problem in the waning seconds—being forced to take low percentage shots.“I think that’s what hurt us,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “We may have had more shots, but we didn’t shoot in good areas to make their goalie make some harder saves.”The late-game hole the Crimson dug for itself was in large part a product of a lack of consistent play. Despite flashes of brilliance in both the first and final quarters, Harvard was outscored 6-2 in the middle frames—including 3-0 in the third—to fall behind 8-5 entering the fourth quarter.“We didn’t capitalize on a couple of shots that we had early on,” co-captain Nick Smith said. “If we had made a couple of shots earlier on, it would’ve been a different game. We just made too many mistakes on both ends of the field, and they took advantage of them.”Things started off slowly for both teams, but the Tigers struck first on a man-up goal just under five minutes into the game. Determined to keep pace, the Crimson battled back with goals from Gibbons, rookie Terry White, and co-captain Max Motschwiller to put three on the board and take a 3-2 lead into the second frame.“Lacrosse is a game of ebbs and flows, and we call it the first punch,” Smith said. “If you throw the first one, it makes a big difference, sets the tone. That’s been an emphasis for us. We succeeded in doing that, but we weren’t able to sustain it for the whole game.”Princeton turned the tables in the second to outscore Harvard by the same margin and send the teams into the break locked up at five.After a lackluster second, things went from bad to worse in the third, as the Tigers quickly struck twice and added a third later in the frame to widen the gap. The Crimson failed to muster any offense, despite out-shooting them 9-6.“Our play was a little sloppy,” Tillman said. “We made some mental errors. When you make mental errors against some of the better teams, they make you pay. Some of the critical ground balls can get you in transition, on a fast break. We weren’t able to get some of those. That was really disappointing.”The game marked Harvard’s second one-goal defeat in a row against a top five Ivy League opponent after a heartbreaking 13-12 loss to Cornell the previous weekend. With an Ancient Eight championship nearly out of reach at this point, the Crimson must look to win out to return to the national tournament for the first time since 2006.“Looking at some of the scores from before the new coaches came in, they were wide,” Tillman said. “We like that those games are now tighter, but at the end of the day, our goal is to win them. We’re not looking for moral victories, we’re looking for Ws. If we don’t get them, we’re selling ourselves short. Our kids are good enough to win these games.”—Staff writer Madeleine I.

The third time was not the charm for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, which suffered its third loss in a row at the hands of a top-10 team, this time falling to No. 7 Princeton, 17-5.The Crimson (4-8, 1-3 Ivy) geared up to play the Tigers (10-1, 4-0) Saturday in Princeton, N.J. for its fourth conference game of the season, but Harvard fell on hard luck against consistently nationally-ranked Princeton.“We did not play the way we needed to compete, and we paid the price,” junior defender Delia Pais wrote in an e-mail. “We started slow, played slow, ended slow. It was a game we just didn’t show up for.”While the Crimson offense boasts the top two scorers in the Ivy League—sophomore Jess Halpern and senior Kaitlin Martin, who have 36 and 34 goals, respectively—the staunch defense of the Tigers held the typically high-scoring Crimson to only five goals. Neither Halpern nor Martin could put a tally on the board for Harvard, and the pair was held to only two shots on goal through the game.Princeton also nullified Crimson offensive threats, junior tri-captain Sara Flood and freshman Tyler Petropulos, who also remained scoreless in Saturday’s match.Harvard was held at zero through the entire first half, and the first 10 minutes of the second half.The Princeton offense was led by Kristin Schwab, who scored a career-high five goals in the match, and Kristin Morrison, who tallied another four.Freshman Katie Doherty tallied the first goal for the Crimson, unassisted, with only 20 minutes remaining in the match. Minutes later, freshman Ellen Gleason put another goal in the back of the net for Harvard, bringing the score to 15-2.  It was the first goal of the rookie’s career.Princeton’s defense again put a hold on the Crimson’s offense, not allowing another goal for 15 minutes straight, but only managed to squeeze two goals past junior goaltender Katherine Martino.Another spark in Harvard’s offense put two more tallies on the board, making the score 17-4. Pais tallied her first collegiate goal, and tri-captain Shannon Flynn added a score of her own, both unassisted.With only 10 seconds remaining in the game, Gleason scored her second goal of the match and of her career, bringing the final score of the game to 17-5.“We did not play well against Princeton,” Gleason said. “We are definitely looking to improve in the upcoming games this week.”Freshman Kerry Clark started the first 13 minutes of the game with three saves, and was replaced by Martino for the remainder of the game. Martino recorded six saves in the last 45 minutes.“Martino came into the game and made some big saves for us,” Gleason said.Princeton now leads the all-time series, 23-15, and has won the past 17 in a row. The Tigers hold a near perfect record this season, the only flaw a 13-12 loss to then-No. 4 Duke in Durham, N.C.“We didn’t come out well against Princeton,” Gleson said. “If we come out strong against Dartmouth we will have a much better opportunity to play all 60 minutes.”The Crimson looks for redemption this week against Ivy opponent Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H. on Wednesday at 4 p.m.“We have a lot to work on, and we will need to put in a week of hard work to fix things,” Pais wrote.

While the Masters wrapped up yesterday, the Harvard men’s golf team was taking on a deep 14-team field at Springdale Golf Club for the Princeton Invitational. And as the Crimson golfers finished up at the 18th green and the results rolled in, Harvard might have felt a bit like an unsuccessful Tiger Woods did in Augusta. Having enjoyed the comforts of first place last weekend at the Yale Spring Opener, the Crimson could only watch from eighth place while Yale—a team it beat a week before—coasted to a second place finish. Rutgers won the invitational. “We know that we’re right there with them,” rookie Tony Grillo said of Yale. “It matters who comes out to play. Columbia and [Yale] are the top two right now, and I’d throw us in that category.”Harvard—represented by juniors Greg Shuman and Danny Mayer, seniors John Christensen and captain Mike Shore, along with Grillo—finished at 619 strokes in the two-day 36-hole tournament. The weekend was intended to go 54 holes, but heavy rains on Saturday cut it down.“The weather was very difficult [Saturday], so it’s hard to have any expectation,” Shuman said. “You just go out there and do the best you can. [Sunday] was chilly, but very windy, so it was also pretty difficult.”Despite having to compete with the conditions, Shuman had a brilliant Saturday round, finishing the day atop the leaderboard with 70 on the par-71 course.“When your playing the game of golf, you’re kind of expecting [the possibility of poor conditions],” Grillo said. “Shuman’s 70 was awesome considering the conditions.”“I played well in the bad weather, and then we had a rain delay for about three hours,” Shuman said. “Coming out I played a little slowly for a few holes and then got increasingly better. I played well when the weather was nicer out, which is nice to see.”On Sunday, Shuman slipped to six over par to finish the weekend at +5, good enough for third overall.Christensen was the second-place Crimson competitor, finishing tied for 38 at 16 over, shooting 82 on Saturday and 76 on Sunday. Mayer and Shore shot 81-78 and 75-84, respectively, both finishing +17 to take a share of 44th. Grillo rounded out the Harvard field with a two-day total of 164 (78-86) to finish 22 over par.“It was tough conditions,” Shuman said. “We managed to play pretty well on Saturday, and [on Sunday] I felt like we took a step backwards, which is frustrating. But it’s good to see where we stack up.”After this weekend and with the league championship coming up in two weeks, the Crimson hopes to improve its position in the Ivy League—behind Yale, Penn, Columbia, and Princeton.“We weren’t just competing with Yale.” Shuman continued. “Everything is preparation for the Ivy League Championship, and obviously we need to improve to do well in that.”Noticeably absent from Harvard’s weekend roster was freshman phenom Mark Pollak, who got the week off so he could have a free weekend—amidst the heavy, weekly schedule of golf’s spring season—to focus on his academics.“Coach told the team that he didn’t really want anyone to get overwhelmed with four tournaments in a row,” Grillo said.Pollak, who topped the Crimson list in the first two spring tournaments—GEICO Intercollegiate and UC Riverside—will be an integral part of the rest of Harvard’s efforts this spring and in the future.“We went out there and obviously not having Mark...it was a handicap right from the start,” Grillo said. “We just wanted to show that our games were in form.”“Next week, we’ll have Pollack back so it’ll probably be a better indication of where we’re at,” Shuman said.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

The runner on first tried to take second, but was beat by a mile by an Albright throw. The runner on third then tries to go home, but it doesn't work. Eventually Albright ends up back with the ball and makes a nice diving tag to get the out.Bot 6, 2 out - slow roller to first, Reynolds covers but Zailskas makes a bad throw to first. Run scores. 9-4.PITCHING CHANGE: Freshman Jeff Reynolds comes in for Watson. Reynolds has been solid in relief. Must be exciting for a rookie to take the mound at Fenway.Bot 6, 2 out - RBI groundout makes it 8-4 Eagles.Bot 6, 1 out - Watson gets the force at third on a bunt. But then two runners advance on a wild pitch.Bot 6, 0 outs - That hurts. Douglas gets a double play ball and makes a bad throw to second. Meehan can't bring it in and everyone's safe.Bot 6, 0 outs - And...wild pitch. Runner scores, although the play at the plate was close. 7-4 BC.PITCHING CHANGE - Senior Ryan Watson replaces Nutter. Watson's a lefty, but has not seen much action in his career, and control issues plague him. It'll be interesting to see what happens.Bot 6, 0 outs - Speedy leadoff man Anston blasts a triple to dead center. Nutter's coming out.Top 6, 3 outs - Stack gets thrown out on a bizarre delayed steal. Top 6, 2 outs - Sac fly for Douglas. 6-4 BC.Top 6, 1 out - Stack-Babich draws a walk, bringing the tying run to the plate in Douglas.Top 6, 1 out - Shadows are creeping over the plate, making it tough to hit.

BC up, 5-3.Bot 5, 0 outs - Mickey Wiswall has been killing Harvard. He hits a double into the left field corner to set the Eagles up with runners on first and second and no outs.Bot 5, 0 outs - Nutter's been knocked around this season, but he showed flashes of brilliance as a freshman. Who knows which Nutter we'll get today.PITCHING CHANGE - Hofeld comes out after a gutsy outing. Nothing dominant but he kept his team in the game. 4 IP, 8 H, 3 ER, 1 K, 1 BB. Sophomore Anthony Nutter takes the mound in relief.Bot 5, 0 outs - Tony Sanchez gets his second hit of the day as the middle of the Eagles lineup is up.Top 5 - 3 outs - Easy 1-2-3 inning for BC, as Dennhardt settles down.Top. 5 - 2 outs - Roberts pops out. Sophomore Tyler Albright is in at catcher and batting ninth, and he too pops out.Bot. 4 - 3 outs - Miscues abound as BC runs itself out of the inning. The runner on first takes off on a 3-2 count and Rogers instinctively, and mistakenly covers second, this allows BC's Lawrence to sneak the ball through the hole at short and get the runner over to third. But an absent-minded Lawrence inexplicably takes off for second and gets gunned down easily by Jon Roberts.Bot. 4 - 2 outs - a foul ball smacks the press box window, which thankfully seems pretty sturdy.Bot. 4 - 2 outs - Centerfielder Robbie Anston ties up the game with a sac fly to left. 3-3.Bot. 4 - 1 out - Eight-hole hitter Harry Darling hits a very, very hard single down the left field line that gets cut off before it hits the wall. No. 9 guy Brad Zapenas follows with a liner to the opposite field. First and third.Bot 4 - 1 out - Hofeld gets a pop up to short to get a quick out.Top 4, 3 outs - Ok so we're wrong again. Pinch hitter Taylor Helgren strikes out, and apparently there were two outs. Either way, 3-2 Harvard.Top 4, 1 out - Exciting play puts Harvard on top. Douglas breaks for second, gets beaten by a mile and Rogers takes off for home. The throw comes home ahead of Rogers, but the catcher bobbles it and Rogers scores. Douglas follows up and steals third, keeping the sac fly in effect. Coach Walsh reminded us before the season that he likes to run, but we really haven't seen it until these last few games.Top 4, 1 out - Douglas walks, and Dennhardt is looking vulnerable for the first time. Zailskas at the plate - he's been hitting well lately.Top 4, 1 out - Tough start for Stack-Babich. He grounds out to the third baseman, who was playing in, keeping Rogers stranded at third. Douglas up to the plate.Top 4, 0 outs - Rogers hits a long, high fly ball to right center, hitting the 379 sign. The centerfielder doesn't see it, and the bases are cleared while Rogers cruises into third with a triple. The game is tied at 2.Top 4, 0 outs - O'Neill takes off on a hit and run, eliminating the double play. Meehan grounds to short, but the distracted shortstop bobbles the ball, allowing Meehan to reach first. The Crimson then continues to be aggressive on the basepaths, orchestrating a double steal. Runners on second and third for the hard-hitting Rogers with no outs.Top 4, 0 outs - And O'Neill draws a leadoff walk. You'd like to see him steal, but he's been getting thrown out quite a bit this season.Top. 4, 0 outs - Looks like the Crimson beat writers had one thing right - O'Neill is back in at the top of the lineup. Looks like Zollo had a good batting practice, but O'Neill is the catalyst.Bot. 3, 3 outs - Great play at first by Dan Zailskas, who dives for a ground ball and flips it to Hofeld just in time to get the out and end the inning.Bot. 3, 2 outs - Hofeld hits Belfiore. He needs to get out of this inning now before the floodgates open.Bot. 3, 2 outs - Cleanup man Mickey Wiswall smashes a double to left center, bringing home Sanchez. 2-0, BC.Bot. 3, 2 outs - BC's Tony Sanchez sneaks one through the right side of the infield to keep the inning going. Bot. 3, 2 outs - Hofeld is going strong, inducing two quick flyouts.Bot. 3, 0 outs - So much for being on top of things. Matt Rogers, normally the starting left fielder, is at short, not Sean O'Hara. The Crimson beat writing team is befuddled, but obviously Coach Walsh knows what he's doing, because Rogers has been playing a great shortstop.Top. 3, 3 outs - Wortzman grounds into a double play to end the inning.Top. 3, 1 out - Senior Jon Roberts gets hist by a pitch.Top. 3, 1 out - DH Chris Rouches pops out to second.Top. 3, 0 outs - Harvard was lucky to escape the last inning just a run down, and the Crimson needs to capitalize now on the offensive side.Bot. 2, 3 outs - Sean O'Hara was recruited by Harvard for his defense, and he just showed why. Fielding a grounder deep in the hole at short, O'Hara guns a strike to first to get the Crimson out of the inning. [Correction: Never mind...Matt Rogers is starting at shot, not O'Hara. Good defense nonetheless.]Bot. 2, 2 outs - Nice play by Stack-Babich, who runs down a ball in the right-centerfield gap, keeping the runner on second and preventing an extra-base hit.Bot. 2, 1 out - Garrett Smith grounds out weakly to short, but a run scores. This comes after Douglas couldn't get a beat on a high pop-up in foul territory. 1-0, BC.Bot. 2, 0 outs - The runner on first steals second. Senior catcher Jared Wortzman, getting a rare starting nod, fires the ball into center field but shortstop Sean O'Hara [Correction: Matt Rogers] backs up nicely to prevent the run. Could be some Fenway jitters for Wortzman, who's a big-time Red Sox fan.Bot. 2, 0 outs - Stack gets a bad break on a line drive to right field, then bobbles it. Belfiore advances to third and the Eagles are set up with runners on first and third and no outs.Bot. 2, 0 outs - Leadoff walk to BC's Michael Belfiore. Let's see if it comes back to bite the Crimson.Top 2, 3 outs - Junior Dan Zailskas pops out to short right field. "Dennhardt's gonna be a problem," laments a Crimson reporter.Top 2, 2 outs - Captain Harry Douglas goes down swinging. Harvard's going to have to pray that Dennhardt makes a mistake, cuz this kid is nasty.Top 2, 1 out - Harvard cleanup hitter Tom Stack-Babich gets called out on strikes to start off the second inning. Stack strikes out a lot, but if he gets a hold of one it's going over the Monster in a hurry.Bot. 1, 3 outs - Hofeld gets a lazy fly ball to right to end the inning. Good start for the second-year hurler.Bot. 1, 2 out - Woah. Eagles designated hitter Tony Sanchez, who has "slugger" tatooed on his forehead, smashes a fastball that darts foul at the last second to prevent a home run. Hofeld learns his lesson, and gets Tony to chase a breaking ball in the dirt.Bot. 1, 1 out - BC left field Andrew Lawrence rips a double on a one-hopper off the Green Monster.Bot. 1, 1 out - Sophomore Zach Hofeld gets the starting nod for the Crimson and gets a grounder to second to start off the game. Hofeld pitched well in relief in last week's Round 1 matchup against Northeastern, and earns the start here.Top 1, 2 outs - Senior Taylor Meehan flies out to right field, bringing classmate Matt Rogers to the plate. Rogers had been on a tear, hitting eight homers early in the season, but has cooled down of late. He grounds out to short to end the inning.Top 1, 1 out - So much for that. Zollo struck out. BC pitcher Mike Dennhardt has some nasty stuff. Could be a long day for the Crimson bats.Top 1, 0 outs - Sophomore Tom Zollo, who's starting in center, is leading off the game. Coach Joe Walsh occasionally has the hottest hitter in batting practice lead off, which might be why normal starter Dillon O'Neill isn't in his customary spot at the top of the order.Welcome to The Harvard Crimson's live blog of the Harvard baseball team's Beanpot consolation game against Boston College at Fenway Park. We just heard the national anthem, and it's time to play ball!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a rather disappointing and uneventful two days for the Harvard sailing team this past weekend out on the Charles River, as the Crimson competed in some of the trickiest conditions of its spring season.While the women’s squad did not compete over the weekend, the co-ed squad’s top sailors took part in the Marchiando/Friis Trophy Team Race while other members of the team competed in the Central Series Four regatta, both contested in Cambridge.It was Harvard’s most limited action in three weeks, and the regattas represented the end of team racing for the co-ed squad for the next several weeks until the championship portion of the schedule begins in May.“We had a lot of trouble this weekend,” junior crew Michelle Konstadt said. “We really should not have had so much trouble, as we were sailing on our home water. However, northwest winds on the Charles are some of the toughest conditions we will face all year.”MARCHIANDO/FRIIS TROPHY TEAM RACEHarvard’s co-ed squad finished a disappointing eighth out of eight teams over the weekend in the Marchiando/Friis Trophy Team Race hosted by Tufts University. While the Crimson came out fairly strong on day one of the two-day affair, with two victories over the College of Charleston, earning a trip to the gold fleet of competition for day two, Harvard went winless on Sunday.“We had a good Saturday,” Konstadt said. “But we were really disappointed with the way things went on Sunday.”Boston College took home the team trophy from the two days of competition, with six other notable east coast collegiate sailing programs also ahead of the Crimson.While Harvard’s regulars competed in this regatta over the weekend, the Crimson tinkered a bit with its lineups due to the difficult conditions it faced out on the water.“We mixed it up with most of our pairings,” Konstadt said. “We have four good skippers, but only three can compete at a time, so they are constantly rotating. We were forced to make these slight modifications due to the northwest winds.”Sophomore captain skipper Alan Palmer teamed up with senior crew Lauren Brants for the entire weekend. Other than that combination, the lineups were thoroughly mixed for Harvard throughout the two days of contests. Senior Jon Garrity, sophomore John Stokes, and sophomore Teddy Himler skippered for the Crimson in the team racing competition, while sophomore Grace Charles, sophomore Quincy Bock, junior Winston Yan, and Konstadt shared time at crew.Although Harvard’s sailors were less than satisfied their results from the weekend, the squad did learn valuable lessons heading into the fleet racing portion of their schedule next weekend.“We have really awesome coaching and I think we will get to sail the boats faster next weekend during our fleet races,” Konstadt said. “We need to work on going faster, as can be seen from this past weekend, so I think it is a good time for us to compete in fleet competitions.”CENTRAL SERIES FOUR REGATTAThe Crimson co-ed squad also sent a contingent to compete at the local Central Series Four regatta on the Charles, a one-day event hosted by Harvard over the weekend. The Crimson took home fifth place out of a field of eight teams, with sophomore skipper Matt Donelan and freshman crew Will White, who is also a Crimson news writer, teaming up in the A boat. Junior skipper Mark Rinaldi and freshman crew Alex Jumper competed in the B boat for Harvard. The Jumbos from Tufts University took home the team trophy from the Saturday contest.While Harvard might not face other colleges’ top sailors at Central Series events, the Crimson still considers the competitions great opportunities to race local New England squads.“The Central Series regattas provide a great opportunity to race a bunch of other teams without having to travel too far,” Jumper said. It was pretty rainy and windy out on the Charles this weekend, and we had to wait for the crew regatta to finish up, but it was nice to be sailing at home and with some different lineups than usual.”—Staff writer Thomas D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in a Beanpot consolation game yesterday on a picturesque spring afternoon, it would have been easy to get caught up in the majesty of Fenway Park. But as much as the Harvard baseball team enjoyed its historic surroundings, it knew it had to get down to business and focus on the game.The Crimson (8-22, 6-4 Ivy League) began strong but dropped its second Beanpot contest, 9-5, to Boston College (23-12, 5-3 ACC), failing to hold up late after building a 3-2 lead. Still, Harvard coach Joe Walsh did not blame his squad’s defeat on the distraction of playing in a big league ballpark.“It’s still baseball, and I think [the excitement] wears off a little bit after the first pitch,” he said. “You’re playing another college team.”Despite a good effort from sophomore starter Zach Hofeld and strong defensive play, the Crimson struggled to match its opponent’s offense against Eagles freshman hurler Mike Dennhardt. The hard-throwing righty—who, accoring to Walsh, reached speeds above 90 mph in high school—struck out three of the first six batters he faced and allowed four earned runs over 5.1 innings to improve to 3-0 on the season.“[Dennhardt] was throwing pretty well,” Walsh said. “Give him a lot of credit, he was shutting us down and we really didn’t get a lot of hits off of him.”Harvard only collected three base hits in the first seven innings, but aggressive baserunning and intelligent moves kept the Crimson in the contest.Down 2-0 in the fourth, sophomore center fielder Dillon O’Neill led off the inning with a walk, giving the Crimson speed on the basepaths. A timely hit-and-run pulled BC shortstop Garret Smith towards the bag at second, leaving him unable to cleanly field a grounder from senior Taylor Meehan. Walsh promptly called a double steal, setting up senior shortstop Matt Rogers, who delivered with a drive to the 379-foot marker in left-center field to plate both runners.After a passed ball and walk to captain Harry Douglas, Harvard again turned to its legs to generate a run. Douglas took off for second, prompting a throw from Eagles catcher Harry Darling, which easily beat the runner. But Rogers alertly broke from third, catching BC offguard and sliding in safely to give the Crimson a 3-2 lead.“We got our running game going pretty [well],” Walsh said. “When I saw the linescore up there—three runs on one hit—I was like, ‘This is the kind of baseball I enjoy playing.’”Unfortunately for the Crimson, the offense would go cold after the fourth inning.The Eagles tied the score on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the frame, and chased Hofeld before he could record an out in the fifth. As Harvard brought in a slew of relievers to preserve the weekend rotation, the squad found itself at the mercy of a BC offense that has averaged nearly eight runs a game this season.Back-to-back doubles by Micky Wiswall and Mike Belfiore—the Eagles’ top two RBI men—and a single off the Green Monster gave BC a 6-3 lead against sophomore Anthony Nutter. Although Douglas responded for the Crimson with a sacrifice fly in the top of the sixth, the pitching staff could not quell the Eagles attack.While the 9-5 loss proved a disappointing end to the 2009 Beanpot, Harvard took advantage of the unique experience of competing at Fenway. Walsh worked six seniors into the starting lineup and brought fourth-year pitcher Ryan Watson to the mound, rewarding the upperclassmen for their hard work. The seniors responded, accounting for all five of the Crimson’s hits and four of its runs, as Meehan and Rogers led the pack with two hits apiece.While Rogers had arguably the best day at the plate with two RBI, the senior’s defensive performance was perhaps most impressive, as the regular left fielder filled in at shortstop for injured sophomore Sean O’Hara. After O’Hara became a late scratch due to a sore knee, Rogers stepped in seamlessly, fielding his position in veteran form.“Anytime you get that first ball after having not been in the infield you are a little nervous,” Rogers admitted. “But after getting into the rhythm of the game, that [feeling] goes away.”By flashing the leather and connecting on big hits, Rogers looked at home on a major league diamond. But Harvard as a team must connect more pieces if it hopes to produce more victories. With six Ivy League contests in as many days, the Crimson will look to get back to the business of winning as it enters a critical stretch of the Ancient Eight season.—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They may get to do it every year, but that doesn’t make playing at Fenway any less meaningful for the players on the Harvard baseball team.“It means a lot, especially as a senior,” senior Matt Rogers said. “Anytime you get to come out here and get to play at Fenway it’s something really special.”Crimson coach Joe Walsh named six seniors in his starting lineup, including backup catcher Jared Wortzman—an avid Red Sox fan.But the veterans were not the only ones to get the chance to experience the famous park, as 20 players received playing time in the loss. Walsh changed the designated hitter each time through the lineup.And the sense of history rushed through the veins of the Harvard players as soon as they stepped into the batting box.“It’s a surreal experience. Every time you step out on the field you look around and see the names on the wall,” Rogers said.The names mean different things to different people, of course.“I’ll never forget when Tray Hendricks [’04], one of our former captains, came over at third base, he goes, ‘I can’t believe I was standing in the same box as Babe Ruth,’” Walsh said. “And I say, ‘Hey, around here Trey, it’s the same box as Ted Williams.’”NO MONSTER FOR ROGERSWith sophomore shortstop Sean O’Hara out with a knee injury, Walsh chose to give the nod to senior Jon Roberts—in left field that is. So while Roberts got the opportunity to field balls off the Green Monster, everyday left fielder Rogers was moved to shortstop. “I haven’t been in the infield in a long time but it’s really fun to get a change from the outfield,” Rogers said.Rogers’ first test came in the bottom of the first, and the senior passed with flying colors. With Boston College junior outfielder Barry Butera stealing second, Wortzman overthrew senior second baseman Taylor Meehan. But Rogers was there to back up the play and snag the ball out of the air before it reached the outfield, saving a run in the process.Later that inning, Rogers made a nice scoop and hard throw to beat Eagles’ freshman Brad Zapenas to first and get the Crimson out of a jam.“For not having any ground balls before the game, and then all of a sudden finding out he was at shortstop at Fenway and making a couple plays in the hole, he did a nice job for us today,” Walsh said.Even when Rogers slipped up on a ground ball in the fifth, he was there to pick up his own pieces. Diving to his left, he accidentally knocked the ball into the outfield. Boston College sophomore Garrett Smith, who started the play on first base, saw the mistake and rounded second. But the speedy Rogers—who also stole a base in the game—collected the ball and threw to third in time to beat Smith to the bag.OFF TO THE RACESThe players may have pretended to be David Ortiz or Kevin Youkilis in the batter’s box, but on the basepaths they looked more like Jacoby Ellsbury. Stolen bases were key to the Harvard victory in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader against Yale, and yesterday they kept the Crimson in the game.Harvard stole five bases in the contest—including four in its three-run fourth inning.“We are always trying to be aggressive, especially on the basepaths,” Rogers said. “Anytime you can do that it puts pressure on the other guys.”This was clear in that successful fourth inning. First, sophomore Dillon O’Neill and Meehan successfully orchestrated a double-steal—although the extra bags would not have a direct impact, as Rogers plated both with a deep triple. But two batters later, with Rogers at third and captain Harry Douglas at first, Walsh decided to send Douglas. A strong throw from Eagles’ catcher Harry Darling—which was destined to get the out at second—was cut off before reaching the bag and was redirected home, towards a darting Rogers. Rogers slid safely into the plate, but might have been tagged out had Darling been able to hold onto the ball. The run gave Harvard a 3-2 lead at the time.—Staff writer Jay M.

Some of you might have been traipsing about yesterday with baskets of cute little eggs hanging from your arms, enjoying the day that Jesus Christ rose from the dead after three days in that stone tomb. Or, some of you may have been sorta dead, bloody, and rancid.
A party of zombies convened at Davis Square around noon today before making its way down to Harvard Square. After being publicized on the Internet on portals like Craigslist and Facebook, the event—spontaneously planned by 18-year-old Boston resident James Bennett—successfully amassed about 250 participants.
The zombies, with blood splattered all over their ragged clothing and faces painted pasty white, lurched forward with their arms outstretched, while zombie hunters who survived the zombie apocalypse gripped toy guns to ward off potential threats to their grasps on life. One female zombie gnawed at a bloody heart. One protester held a sign that read "Easter is for candy, not for zombies"—but the individual was inevitably drawn into the masses, soon staggering forward as yet another soulless human shell.
More undeadness after the jump...
But the zombies didn't seem to be all that insensate to the whims of human emotion and the joys offered by heartfelt art. At the end of their march, the zombies began to dance to the flute-tooting of some musicians in the Square—"in a kinda zombie-esque way," as Bennett described it. Around 1:30, the zombies began to disperse, leaving behind streaks of blood on road signs and the glass panes of a bus stop.
For all the morbid connotations of half-dead creatures, bloody foam around the mouth, and putrid flesh, it's no coincidence that the zombie walk happened on the most happy day of the year for Christians:
"It does kinda connect rather well with the whole Jesus' rebirth thing, resurrection-whatever," Bennett said of the event's timing with Easter. "It wasn't mean to offend anyone, but...Jesus is kinda like a zombie."
"Zombies are people, too," Bennett philosophized. "They mindlessly go forward with their lives without thinking."
Never thought about it that way, to be honest.

The Tranny Roadshow is coming to Harvard! Never heard of it? Don’t feel bad, FlyBy hadn’t either until we read this.
This eccentric group of traveling artists will be visiting Harvard April 28th (drat, one day earlier and we could have had prefroshs and trannies here together!).  The group describes itself as "a multimedia performance art extravaganza.  It is composed of an eclectic group of artists, each one self-identified as transgender, and includes poets, rappers, filmmakers, storytellers, breakdancers, rock bands comedians, actors, folk singers, photographers, zinesters, and more."
According to a press release, the show at Harvard will feature nine artists, including “Ignacio Rivera, playwright and performer of “Dancer” and “Lagrimas de Cocodrilo/Crocodile Tears”; Scarlett O’skar, a pop musician who topped the Russian charts before immigrating to the United States; Red Durkin, acclaimed zinester, rapper, and comedienne; and many others.” Tranny get your gun!

Porn and pizza? Together?  Chill out, bros.  This is not an early Christmas present.  Right now (started at 6pm) in Sever 113, OSAPR, the OSAPR Student Alliance, the Center for Wellness at Harvard College, the Harvard College Women's Center, The Undergraduate Council, Harvard Men Against Rape, The Harvard College Black Men's Forum, and the Harvard College Latino Men's Collective are co-sponsoring (eight co-sponsors? Really?) a presentation by Dr. Robert Jensen on the harmful effects that pornography can have on males.
That’s right, guys.  Your grade isn’t the only thing that is going to suffer from those late nights staring at the computer screen pretending to write your tutorial paper.  After Dr. Jensen’s talk, Take Back the Night will hold its kick-off event in Ticknor Lounge.  No fun porn statistics to learn about, but there will be pizza.

Yes, seniors,  we know.  If you're not doing TFA or on the receiving end of a super-sweet fellowship, the prospect of gainful employment seems, at this point, to be always receding ahead of you, like a particularly painful mirage.
But guess what? Barack's got your back! As Lily Whiteman points out, the federal government is hiring like woah.You too can "Ride the Federal Hiring Wave."
Finance? Journalism? The job you get after you concentrate in Folklore & Mythology?
A government answer to all of these fields--the fruits of usajobs.gov--after the jump.
Want to be a financial analyst in New York, yet at the same time "ensure equal access to education and...promote educational excellence throughout the nation? Work for the Department of Education!
Want to be a journalist, but realize that newspapers are going to stop printing not too long from...oops!...there goes another one...Never fear: you can be a broadcaster for Voice of America if you have language skills, or work as an editorial assistant for the Air Force if you don't.
Not to mention the extensive offerings in museum curation and being a folklife specialist.

Apparently, Harvard’s resident  porn magazine for the sexy, the sex-addicted, and the sex-deprived  is still lacking the funds needed for the  printing of its highly-anticipated and highly-delayed fourth issue.
H Bomb, founded in 2004, has  been titillating students as the student body’s “journal of sex  and sexuality,” according to the organization's official website. However,  this pending issue will only be the fourth in nearly five years, since recurring financial issues have hindered the mag’s  timely production.
In an e-mail recently sent out  by H Bomb editors, this issue is just inches away from delivering:
Granted, there are pictures  of naked people. And not just any naked people. Naked Harvard  people. Like that kid who sits next to you in section. Yeah, him. But  really, during a period in which everyone lacks financial stability, that  $10 could go toward a lot of more, well, substantial things. Like a  trip to Wellesley and back! Could be more or less satisfying, depending  on personal taste.
Are students willing to fork  out the cash for some good-natured voyeurism? FlyBy had to find out. You can, too, after the jump!
Rick McKellar ’10 
FlyBy: Do you read or have  you ever read H Bomb?
RM: I have seen H Bomb, but  do not read it for its articles.
FlyBy: How much would you pay  to see your classmates naked?
RM: I would not pay to see  my classmates naked.  They could pay me to look at them I guess, although  this probably would not help their financial situation.
FlyBy: H Bomb is currently  in a financial crunch. They need $10 donations from people to pre-order  their magazines. Would you do it? Why/why not?
RM: I am not interested in  buying H Bomb.  I think naked pictures of our classmates should either  be free, or not distributed at all.
Serena Y. Zhao ’12
FlyBy: Would you be willing  to donate $10 for an issue of H Bomb?
SYZ: Already did it!
David L. Orama ’12
FlyBy: Are you well acquainted  with the contents of H Bomb?
DLO: I’ve looked through an  issue before. I haven’t read any of it…but I’ve looked at the  pictures.
FlyBy: The magazine is in need  of funding and is asking for $10 donations from students to help with  production. Would you be willing to pay $10 in advance for a copy?
DO: I would, theoretically…
FlyBy: Why theoretically?
DO: Sex should be enjoyed by  the masses…But I am a poor college student. I have no money right  now.
FlyBy: Ok. Just curious. If  you could see anyone from Harvard in the magazine, nude, who would it  be?
DO: Oh dear, I don't know too  many people…Drew Faust? Oh! And Dean Evelynn Hammonds. Wait…we need  a guy, don’t we? DEAN DINGMAN. Yes.
And we at FlyBy thought we had a strange obsession with the administration...
