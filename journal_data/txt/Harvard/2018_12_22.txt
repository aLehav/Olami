What is the color of dragon blood? A dark, dusty red, at least according to the archives of the Forbes Pigment Collection. The legendary pigment was purportedly gathered from dragon wounds in the Middle Ages; more accurately, its color comes from tree resin. Conservation scientists at the Collection work to unlock the mystery of this centuries-old pigment, along with many other mystical colors.
Over the past few years, the Forbes Pigment Collection, housed at the Harvard Art Museums, has attracted a significant amount of attention. Held in a staff-only area of the museum, it can be viewed across the courtyard from the museum’s fourth floor. Enclosed by floor-to-ceiling windows, the pigment collection calls home a wall of cabinets installed during a 2014 renovation of the museum.
The collection — arranged according to the exploded color wheel — is striking. Edward Waldo Forbes started the collection in the early 1920s, and made it official in 1928. Originally, Forbes sought to create the pigment collection after purchasing a damaged Renaissance painting of the virgin and child. Hoping to restore the painting to its original brilliance, Forbes realized that he needed to understand the materials he was working with — and so the pigment collection was born.
“The function of the pigment collection really hasn’t changed. It’s the same thing that it was for Forbes: it’s a set of analytical standards that are used to study and to help understand art and art making,” says Alison M. Cariens, the conservation coordinator for the Harvard Art museums.
While the pigment collection may have ties to ancient history, the Harvard Art Museums and Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies are dedicated to putting the collection to use in the present day. The collection is continually updated, and over the past few years, colors such as Surrey NanoSystems’s Vantablack (of which Anish Kapoor famously boasts sole artistic ownership) and Stuart Semple’s “pinkest pink” have been added.
It’s a popular misconception that the collection is primarily used for artmaking. Although the Straus Center conservators do significant work to repair and preserve their paintings via art conservation, the pigments are never directly added to a canvas. “We would never use them in conservation, because we want what our conservators do to be distinct,” Cariens says. “Scientifically, visually. It’s not ethical to pretend that you are Van Gogh, because you’re not.”
While its contents are never directly applied to canvases, the pigment collection’s principal aim is to facilitate art conservation. It actually spurred the hire of the first conservation scientists in the United States. And it forms a critical source of information when dissecting the history of any painting: “The pigment collection informs a lot of what we do that isn’t treatment-based. It informs the way that we are able to teach... It informs a lot of outside research, and a lot of the research we are doing here,” says Anne D. Schaffer, paintings conservation fellow at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies.
Sometimes, experts have used the collection to evaluate the legitimacy of a painting's attribution to any one artist. By analyzing the chemical makeup of the pigments used in a painting and comparing them to the known standards of the Forbes collection, analysts can determine whether the colors used would have been available to a specific artist during their lifetime, or if a pigment would be available in the region from which the painting is believed to have originated.
One example is a painting purportedly by Jackson Pollock that went on the market a few years ago. “Everything aligned really well, like connoisseurship. Curators were saying this looks like it could be his stuff,” Cariens says. “But this lab ran tests of the pigments that were used, using these as a standard, and discovered that the red that was used was not available in art-making materials until 20 years after Jackson Pollock had died.”
Some also consult the collection when classifying pigments. Sometimes the names are hard to distinguish — for instance, there are a dozen varieties of cerulean — while others are as eclectic as jelly bean flavors. According to Cariens, for instance, pink is “not historically a color,” but rather “the only color that only exists in our mind”: a reflection from each end of the visible light spectrum. The human eye takes in both red and violet or blue wavelengths and combines them. To name the color allows us to employ it — in our paintings, and, consequently, in conservation.
Next time you find yourself in the lobby of the Harvard Art Museums, look up. You’ll find a kaleidoscope of color, each vial encapsulating a history of encounters between art and science.

Court documents filed in a recently settled lawsuit against billionaire, Harvard donor, and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein allege Epstein directed a second woman to have sex with Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz.
The new charge against Dershowitz came to light during a Nov. 7 hearing in a lawsuit filed by Sarah Ransome against Epstein, his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and several others, the Miami Herald reported Wednesday. Ransome alleges Epstein and Maxwell trafficked her for sex in 2006 and 2007.
Epstein — who holds strong ties to the University through multi-million dollar donations and close relationships with high-profile affiliates — was first charged with operating a sex ring of underage girls out of his Palm Beach, Fla. home in 2005. At the time, Dershowitz served on the seven-person legal team that struck a plea deal with prosecutors on Epstein’s behalf, the Herald reported in a three-part feature last month.
During the Nov. 7 hearing, Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger, mentioned Dershowitz’s name as one of several “third party” persons Ransome alleges Epstein directed her to have sex with, the New York Daily News first reported. The transcript of that hearing, once publicly available, has since been sealed.
Nowhere in the case or the transcript does anyone allege Ransome had sex with Dershowitz, according to the Herald.
Dershowitz repeatedly denied the allegations in an interview with The Crimson Thursday.
Dershowitz said he has never met Ransome and he questioned her credibility. He said Ransome has previously contacted the New York Post with evidence that Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump had engaged in sexual activity with minors, but that a reporter from the Post had told him Ransome was not credible.
Dershowitz said he believes he is a victim, which is why he is “speaking out” publicly about the accusation.
“I am a victim of a false accusation, a deliberate false accusation, an attempt to frame me for money,” he said. “And victims should speak out.”
Ransome’s lawyer David Boies responded to Dershowitz’s comments on his clients in an email to The Crimson Friday, writing that “it is reprehensible for him to continue to attack and demean young women who he knows were sex trafficking victims of his friend and client Jeffrey Epstein.”
Boies declined to comment on the “specific facts that were revealed in discovery” in Ransome’s case, citing “existing protective orders.”
Dershowitz first faced allegations of having sexual relations with a minor in 2015, when Virginia Roberts — another woman who accused Epstein of trafficking her — stated in an affidavit in a Florida federal court that Epstein “forced” her to have sexual relations with Dershowitz “while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”
Dershowitz has denied Roberts’ allegations multiple times over several years and has stated that he has never met Roberts. The judge presiding over the case ultimately struck the allegations from the record without commenting on their veracity, stating that they were not relevant to the suit.
Dershowitz previously wrote in a letter to the Herald that he not only “denied” that he had sex with Roberts — as was reported in the Herald — but that he “disproved it” during an investigation run by former FBI chief Louis J. Freeh.
After the new allegation against Dershowitz became public earlier this week, Ransome’s suit was confidentially settled Thursday, court documents state.
Dershowitz said Boies orchestrated Ransome’s allegation against him in retaliation for a bar complaint Dershowitz filed against Boies, calling Boies a “villain.”
“This is the result of a threat by David Boies, against whom I filed ethics charges with the bar, that if I did not withdraw my ethics charges, he would come up with another woman,” Dershowitz said.
Boies wrote that Dershowitz’s accusations against him are “completely false.”
“Mr. Dershowitz should be ashamed of himself,” Boies wrote. “I am ashamed he is a member of my profession.”
“Harvard should be ashamed of his association with it,” he added.
Harvard spokespeople Robb London and Melodie Jackson declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 Harvard sophomore Matt Freese has chosen to forego his further two years of NCAA eligibility, as he signed for the Philadelphia Union on Friday. Freese spent time in the Union Academy before coming to Harvard, and will now join six other homegrown players on the Union roster. The Wayne, Pennsylvania, native, who played two years for the Crimson, is one of only two goalkeepers currently on the 2019 Union roster.
“This has been in my mind for a bunch of years, playing for the Union,” Freese said in a conference call to reporters. “It obviously means everything to me that I’m starting my career here with the people that raised me and turned me into the person and the soccer player that I am. Like Jim (Curtin) was saying yesterday, back at YSC when it was called Rocket Sports, I was involved in the first Union Juniors training session, literally when the Union were first created. Just the progression through that and the academy and with local clubs makes everything more meaningful and more special.”
Freese competed for the Philadelphia Union Academy from a young age, making six starts in seven academy appearances in 2016-2017, his senior season. Freese has also played for the Philadelphia Union’s USL affiliate team, Bethlehem Steel FC, three times as a member of the Union Academy.
Freese also boasts international experience, as he was called up to the U-19 United States Men’s National Team camp in February 2017. This was not the only interest shown last year, as just months later, English super-club Manchester United asked Freese to visit for a trial.
Despite these opportunities, Freese decided to continue his soccer career at Harvard, rather than turning pro immediately. Freese has followed the footsteps of his two older brothers by attending Harvard. While he was playing soccer for the Crimson, he did not lose connections with the Union. During breaks from college and over the summer, Freese would return to train with the Philadelphia Union and Bethlehem Steel FC.
Freese is the 10th soccer player to play for the Crimson who has had an opportunity to play in the MLS. One of the most successful of these players was Mike Fucito, one of the current assistant coaches for the Harvard Men’s Soccer team. Fucito had stints in the MLS with Seattle and Portland before returning to Cambridge as a coach.
Freese had a notable career at Harvard, finishing his collegiate career with 77 saves in 16 games over two seasons. He leaves the Crimson with a 1.82 goals against average and .778 save percentage. During his sophomore season Freese played in 13 games, and was awarded a spot in the All-Ivy League Second team. Freese also averaged 5.28 saves per game last season which led the Ivy League.
Even though there are currently only two goalies on the Union’s roster, it seems that veteran keeper Andre Blake will have the starting spot locked down in the near future. Time in goal with Bethlehem Steel this season is a real possibility for Freese though. The Union’s backup keeper, John McCarthy, as well as Bethlehem Steel FC’s keeper, Jake McGuire, have both been out of contract since the end of the 2018 season, which could mean more opportunities for Freese.
Freese holds a German passport, which would make a move to Europe in the future much more realistic, as work permits can be hard to acquire for non-Europeans. Freese briefly hinted at interest from other clubs besides the Union and Manchester United, but didn’t go into detail. Having a European passport could make it easier for Freese to make the transition into playing for a European team, but for now, Matt is excited about his professional career at the Union.
“I think that period of time is where I really put my mind to it and I kind of decided that everything I’m going to do is going toward being a professional,” Freese said. “Brad really inspired me from the national team camp. He’s such a prominent figure in American soccer history, specifically with goalkeepers. He talked to me about the honor of being able to represent the country, and he inspired me and showed me what it could be if I continue working.”
