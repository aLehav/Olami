After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his 1933 essay “The Hedgehog and the Fox,” Isaiah Berlin famously claims that some writers and thinkers—the hedgehogs—saw the world in terms of a single, all-encompassing idea, while others—the foxes—drew upon an arsenal of disparate ideas, often unrelated and even antithetical, in order to make sense of the reality in which they live.
Berlin’s distinction was, in essence, one of model choice. Hedgehogs rely on a unitary model of reality, while foxes deftly use a variety of models to build their understanding of the world.
George Box, a statistician, wrote that “all models are wrong, but some are useful.” My own version of Box’s aphorism is this: All models are wrong, but almost all can be useful, to some degree, sometimes. Few ways of seeing reality are utterly useless. Foxes, as avid collectors of models, own an ever-growing Swiss Army knife of varying utility in different scenarios. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, are stuck with an intrinsically imperfect sledgehammer, and the inescapable conviction that everything looks like a nail.
Having access to a collection of models allows foxes to slip into the guise of any particular hedgehog when the moment calls. They leap to and from the shoulders of giants: not ideologically committed to Smith’s hammer or Marx’s mallet, but rather choosing the tool that can be most effectively applied at a particular time to understand a sprawling notion like capitalism. A sledgehammer may be powerful, but a hungry Swiss Army officer trying to open a can of beans has never been upset that there was a knife with a can opener in her pocket instead.
I like to think that Harvard has made us all more like foxes. I was fortunate over the last four years to have had close friends who believed in models of the world that were entirely distinct from mine. Early on, it was immensely difficult for me to even consider a view of the world in which people weren’t always rational and self-interested. But after hours and hours in the Mather dining hall debating and sometimes fighting, each of us would always leave, perhaps grudgingly, with yet another tool in our Swiss Army knives. These long and tiring nights will remain some of my most treasured memories at this place.
Becoming more fox-like is important because hedgehogs that view reality through different lenses can only ever talk past each other. As such, being a fox is, at its core, about being empathetic and humble in how we understand the world. The fox must not only take worldviews entirely unfamiliar to it as its own, but also be unafraid to draw upon them when they explain reality with more fidelity than the models it already prefers. We can only become the citizens and citizen-leaders of Harvard’s mission statement when we, like foxes, engage with rather than dismiss those who see things in ways completely novel to us.
The hedgehog’s lack of intellectual empathy and humility springs up again and again, right here at Harvard and more broadly in the world. It’s hard to imagine that the incredible complexity of our world can be completely distilled down to issues of race; however, it’s also hard to entirely deny the existence of social constructions that disproportionately disadvantage certain groups of people. Divestment is not simply a question of moral imperatives as its proponents often suggest, but it is also not necessarily a purely economic issue as its opponents might argue. Refusing to see anything but wealth inequality as the root of all of society’s problems is foolhardy, but refusing to admit that making the rich richer doesn’t always help the poor is equally as naïve. We ought to recognize that each of these models contains some hint of the truth, but to fully commit to any one of them—as a hedgehog might—is to hold a fundamentally incomplete view of reality.
This very column has taken a purposefully and obviously deficient view of the world, understanding love, Monopoly, and happiness only in terms of expected value, volatility, and utility functions. But I offer this narrow perspective only because I think it is a model of the world that is often missing from intellectual toolboxes. Navigating love, winning Monopoly, and finding happiness are some of the most important facets of the lives we lead, and to rely solely on intuition or the arts to do so is as futile as it is to rely solely on mathematics.
My fellow seniors and I will soon depart to serve our country and our kind in a world far more complex than any single model could possibly capture. We were fortunate enough to have spent four years in dining halls and classrooms surrounded by an incredible density of different models of reality. It is our responsibility now to be wary of imposing our favored models on the world, and to choose, from the arsenal of frameworks we’ve been so lucky to collect from our peers and our professors, the best models to fit the ever-changing contours of the different scientific, societal, and moral problems we will inevitably face. This imperative might just be, in the words of the Canadian philosopher Aubrey Graham, what Harvard gets us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved.
I met Ignacio at a queer Valentine’s Day party my freshman year. We were Datamatches who had decided to meet, and we danced and chatted about life between surreptitious shots from the vodka bottle hidden in his jacket. He was kind, handsome, and ended up becoming a series of firsts for me: First date, first romantic relationship, first sexual experience.  
One particular conversation stands out. I mentioned that walking to the Quad alone at night made me nervous; Ignacio looked at me and my broad shoulders and told me I had nothing to worry about—I was not “waifish” and could protect myself.
He was right. I have never been bothered while walking through Cambridge Common at night. Ironically, when I was sexually assaulted, it was not in a dark public park or hidden alleyway. Two weeks after Ignacio told me we should stop seeing each other, I went to a party in Adams to try to “move on.” I left feeling confused, scared… and a survivor.
In 2013, a year when the conversation surrounding sexual assault on college campuses was picking up speed at Harvard and elsewhere, to be sexually assaulted felt like a cruel joke. Should I report? What would happen next? Would anyone believe me?
***
Those first few months post-assault I lived on edge. I was perpetually scared; I felt I could not trust anyone, especially other gay men. I worried that something I said or did would give me away, that I would let someone know that I was damaged.
That summer, I went home and slept sixteen hours a day, leaving bed occasionally only to eat. I tried to tell my parents and friends, but the cultural expectations of masculinity forced the words back down by throat. I came back in August forty pounds lighter, furiously determined to ignore what had happened despite my growing anxiety and fear.
It was on my third day back that I saw Ignacio again. We had tried to remain friends, but the onset of trauma-induced depression and anxiety burned those bridges. Yet seeing him again brought a sense of peace; here was someone I knew I could trust. Perhaps it was because I knew he would not hurt me—after all, we’d already shared consensual and positive sexual experiences. But now, I was no longer thinking about romance or sex with him; all I knew was that with him, I felt safe.
I tried to see him as frequently as I could. It was completely one-sided, but the peace I had around him made me ignore his lukewarm responses to my messages. Using increasingly unrealistic excuses, I continued to abuse his time and unwilling friendship for two years to get snippets of tranquility. It’s impossible for me to understand the full impact of this abuse on Ignacio, but I know it was overwhelming. Several of our mutual friends told me to stop contacting him, that he could no longer handle the amount of pain I was thrusting onto his shoulders, pain he did not understand.
In a last ditch effort for his attention, I disclosed my survivor status to him. To his credit, he responded “correctly”; he was supportive, caring, and did not pry. But as I continued to spiral further into depression, my relationship, or lack thereof, with Ignacio also deteriorated as I relied on him more and more. At first he was receptive, likely due to the guilt that can be associated with refusing to support a traumatized friend.
Eventually though, Ignacio had enough. He requested that I stop; stop trying to contact him and stop finding reasons that we needed to speak. Despite my pleas, Ignacio would not respond to me again. I never heard much from him again, but whispers about Ignacio’s “crazy ex-boyfriend” would float by me for the next two years.
***
I eventually began to heal. My assailant’s graduation helped, and the team responsible for my treatment at Counseling And Mental Health Services helped me learn to cope with my depression and anxiety. I can date without anxiety, I enjoy my relationships with others, and—most important of all—I usually feel safe. I have been very lucky and am grateful to the multitude of resources I found at Harvard. (That being said, Harvard’s mental health services and sexual assault policies are still imperfect and I certainly recognize and support survivors with experiences different from mine.)
Though healing came with a bevy of positive outcomes, it also meant acknowledging what I had done wrong with regards to Ignacio. Being sexually assaulted had paradoxically made me ignore his sense of safety and his agency. I was passing on to him the burden of my assault without his consent. I had presented him with an unfortunate choice: To unwillingly engage in emotional labor to exhaustion or to abandon a struggling friend for the sake of his own mental health. In truth, for Ignacio and for others in similar situations, this may not feel like a choice at all. The societal pressure that comes with supporting a friend too easily renders the two options into a non-choice, forcing people to shoulder burdens that they are unwilling or unprepared to bear.
It’s important to recognize sexual assault and rape as illnesses of a community and to acknowledge that the whole community must come together to support survivors; however, I latched on to a single relationship like a life jacket, drowning the man who was wearing it. The negative impacts of sexual assault seeped from me and pervaded Ignacio’s life—it’s hardly surprising that he chose to disengage, to escape while he could. While I have since forgiven myself for what I did to Ignacio, it’s apparent that he has not.
I can hardly fault him for his decision. Often, we are told to support our struggling friends without rest, to forsake our own health for theirs. However, this type of support comes at a high price—one that Ignacio bore until I imagine he had nothing more left to give. It is through this slow, creeping way that the effects of sexual assault, depression, and other mental illnesses move from survivors and patients to friends and family, whose emotional labor comes at the expense of their own wellbeing. Our mental health resources—still inadequate for supporting patients—are similarly lacking for the support networks of survivors, meaning friends and families must give of themselves without thinking of the repercussions. What happens when no one has anything left to give?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge city councillors lauded a recently proposed $574 million city budget for the 2017 fiscal year that appropriated millions of dollars for projects in Harvard Square, and increased educational funding while holding property taxes relatively steady.
“We’ve managed to increase services and not cut services and still keep property taxes low,” Finance Committee Chair and Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said following Thursday's City Council Finance Committee meeting. “It is a pretty remarkable accomplishment in this day and age.”
Councillors praised initiatives, including a more than 5 percent increase in the school district budget, expanded contracts for non-profit organizations like food pantries, and bolstered funding for affordable housing units to combat what councilors are calling a housing crisis. McGovern touted the $146 million school complex on Cambridge Street that will include a brand new elementary school and middle school.
“The non-profit coalition coming together to do this needs-assessment is something I’ve been talking about under other terminology since the beginning,” Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said. “We’re seeing a huge change in the educational equity organizing.”
Property taxes remained steady this year thanks to what McGovern called “free cash,” the spending of a reserve of money saved for emergencies like floods or for other projects.
“It’s about $195-or-so million,” McGovern said. “It’s really from just over the years our pretty sound fiscal management where they’ve put money on the side.”
According to the budget proposal, Harvard Square is also set to see small renovation projects. The budget includes a $4 million appropriation in FY 17 and FY 18 for renovations to Harvard Square and its Out of Town News kiosk. Earlier this year, the council debated such an appropriation, ultimately leaving the final call to the City Manager’s office. Three and a half million dollars are also appropriated for renovations to the “Eliot Loop,” an area containing Eliot Street, Eliot Plaza, Brattle Street, and Brattle Plaza.
The City Council plays a smaller role in the budget approval process than its does in other local affairs. While the Council ultimately has final say, City Manager Richard C. Rossi and his office were responsible for crafting the more than 400-page document. Despite this lack of direct input, Mazen claimed the Council still holds some sway over what goes into the budget.
“There’s a little bit of Ouija clout-pressure on the budget where things I’ve advocated for tend to find their way into the budget,” Mazen said. “The Council should have several looks at the budget before we see a hard-copy and a couple looks at working collaboratively as a council to define the budget ahead of time.”
Harvard pays property taxes on non-educational buildings and provides extra funds to Cambridge in lieu of taxes. MIT and Cambridge have a similar relationship. Not including payments in lieu of taxes, the two universities make up over nine percent of the city’s tax base.
“One of the things that we hear is that ‘well Cambridge has Harvard and MIT so anyone can put together a good budget.’ Harvard and MIT are huge resources for us,” McGovern said. “But there have been times when the city is broke and services haven’t been good.”
While not included in the FY 17 budget, earlier this week Rossi and Somerville Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone announced a joint effort to provide $75 million for the long-delayed Green Line extension project in northern Cambridge.
“Somerville and Cambridge will stand with the Commonwealth to advance the state of the art,” Rossi and Curtatone wrote in a statement. “We do so with the expectation that this is truly a new precedent for statewide policy, and that our communities will not be held to higher standards than other Massachusetts municipalities seeking state and federal financing for roadway, transit or other infrastructure projects.”
Rossi pledged $25 million from Cambridge, however such a plan must still be approved by the City Council. In a letter to the Council, Rossi said he would suggest the matter be forwarded to the City Council’s Transportation and Public Utilities Committee.
The pledged funds for the Green Line Extension mark a change in tone from Rossi, who said passing the city’s budget would be one of his final projects as City Manager. Rossi announced his upcoming retirement in March.
While the City Council has until June 6 to adopt a budget, the City Manager’s office has already predicted approval of the budget on May 23, when the City Council is scheduled to vote on the matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee decided last month to postpone a planned inquiry into Bach Society Orchestra after the club raised concerns about the committee’s system of due process for adjudicating alleged rule violations.
The Finance Committee revoked funding from Bach Society’s final concert of the year because of a rule that prohibits the UC from funding events that take place during reading period. In response to a Crimson inquiry, UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 found that the dates listed on Bach Society’s grant application did not include the date of the concert itself.
The committee later voted unanimously to open an inquiry into the club, originally set to take place April 27, to determine whether there was sufficient “evidence of dishonesty” to warrant disqualifying Bach Society from receiving future funding.
The vote required the committee to pass the “Violation Adjudication Act of 2016,” which detailed the procedure for conducting a formal inquiry.
However, in an email sent to Greenlaw the day before the scheduled inquiry, Bach Society’s management requested that the inquiry be postponed because the date of the meeting coincided with the orchestra’s rehearsal. Greenlaw supported the request, but because the committee failed to reach a quorum on the scheduled date it was unable to conduct the inquiry regardless.
“If you want to be here and testify, and we tell you you can't testify, that's a blatant disregard for substantive due process,” Greenlaw said.
During the Finance Committee’s meeting on April 27, committee members instead discussed Bach Society’s concerns about due process, and debated whether to reschedule the inquiry this semester or push a decision to the fall.
One concern Bach Society raised involved the wording of the grant application, which asks for the “start date” and “end date” of any project for which clubs apply to receive funding. Bach Society’s statement noted that the UC does not specify what the “end date” of a project is supposed to mean.
“Absent such a provision, any reasonable interpretation consistent with an organization's actual practices can be adopted by an honest, ethical person writing the grant application,” Bach Society’s statement said.
The statement also emphasized that “any legislation or regulations which are pending or which had not yet been passed at the time we submitted our Concert IV grant can have no bearing on the outcome of these proceedings, as we can only be reasonably expected to comply with rules which already existed at the time.”
Greenlaw suggested that he will likely consult professors at the Law School, including Law School Professor and Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., for guidance on crafting a fair inquiry process.
“If we're going to be a just institution, the process to administer justice must be just itself,” Greenlaw said.
Bach Society’s statement also noted that the UC has historically funded reading period events indirectly by “providing funds to the Houses which are used for house formals.” Acknowledging such funding, and also identifying three other events which had inadvertently received funding over reading period, the Finance Committee considered pushing for a change to the reading period rule.
“We are pleased that the UC was responsive to the procedural concerns that we raised privately with them,” Bach Society production manager Juhwan Seo ’17 wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson.
Some representatives at the last Finance Committee meeting expressed concern over dropping the inquiry, emphasizing the importance of holding student groups accountable for the truthfulness of grant applications.
“We still have the same problem, we're not disincentivizing them from doing this again,” Pforzheimer House Representative Neel Mehta ’18 said.
Greenlaw noted that because any future inquiry would take place after new UC representatives are elected in the fall, next year’s Finance Committee will have to vote to determine whether to move forward with the inquiry.
“If there's enough political will and a benefit to the public trust to doing so, we can re-open an inquiry,” Greenlaw said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of undergraduate women involved in sororities and female final clubs took to social media to defend their organizations and criticize a new Harvard policy that will penalize involvement in all unrecognized single-gender social groups.
While talk of a Friday protest of the new policy—which, starting with the Class of 2021 will bar students in unrecognized single gender social groups from holding leadership positions in recognized organizations and athletic teams—yielded no concrete action, women instead turned to Facebook to express their discontent. 
Members of Harvard’s unrecognized sororities and female final clubs, which the College does not recognize, posted group pictures and personal testimonies, arguing for the importance of the all-female groups. Expressing outrage in lengthy posts, many said they were surprised that the new policy broadly penalizes all unrecognized single gender social groups, making no distinction between all-male and all-female organizations.
In separate Facebook posts on Friday, Sablière Society member Chelsea R. Lide ’16 praised her club, writing that “there's no sanction in the world that can diminish the love and support I've received from these amazing, inspiring women” and accusing Harvard of “setting a precedent" by which institutions can control “groups [students] should be allowed to associate with.” She also criticized administrators for, in her opinion, ignoring female perspectives, echoing a sentiment expressed by graduate Sablière leaders in an op-ed written before the announcement.
 In response to that op-ed, last week, Assistant Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote that ‘The College has and will continue to extended offers to meet and discuss the specific situations of the clubs, however, it is up to the clubs to accept those invitations.”
Catherine G. Katz ’13, a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, wrote an “Open Letter” to Harvard about the decision on blogging platform Medium. In her post, Katz argued that administrators should have favored “community conversation and cooperation between concerned students and social club members.”
“While the administrators’ hearts are in the right place, this is not the proper manner with which to handle the situation,” Katz said in an interview. In a letter to undergraduates explaining the new policy, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote that "The College developed these recommendations with careful deliberation. Over the past two years, we have engaged with students, including those who are members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations and those who are not." A subcommittee of the task force for the prevention of sexual assault on campus, whose report in March lambasted final clubs, also sought out the perspectives of students when crafting preliminary recommendations for how Harvard should handle final clubs.
Additionally, Khurana wrote that “These new policies will not prevent undergraduates from choosing their own paths while at Harvard.”
Khurana framed his decision as part of Harvard’s “long and complex history of grappling with gender discrimination,” referencing Harvard’s integration with Radcliffe College and writing that “[i]n every era, change has come slowly and often with fierce opposition.”
Many sorority members, beholden to rules set by national parent organizations declined to comment for the story.
One popular post among undergraduates was written by a male student who is not a member of a single-gender social club.
Aaron A. Slipper ’18 took to Facebook Friday around 11 p.m. to share an article from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Several hours later, at 5 a.m., Slipper posted a more than 3,000 word status—which he later uploaded to Dropbox—maligning the new policy and criticizing how Harvard came to its decision.
Slipper’s post was widely shared, including by Lide, who wrote that “this is worth your time.”
Timothy M. Burke, an attorney who has spent much of his career working for Greek organizations, arguing that women “get a particular value out of being able to have single-sex organizations.”
The new policies enacted by Harvard come at the conclusion of a year riddled with tension between the College and unrecognized, single-gender social organizations, primarily all-male final clubs. Two historically all-male clubs admitted women into their membership last fall, and Harvard administrators have repeatedly requested the other six all-male clubs do the same.

For the fifth season in a row, the Harvard women’s golf team took the course in the NCAA regional round. This time around, the Crimson took a trip to The University Club in Baton Rouge, La. to join a field of 18 competitors. After three rounds of play, the women walked away in a tie for ninth.
The top six teams from each region earn a trip to the NCAA Championship tournament in Eugene, Ore., which will be held May 20-25. For the Baton Rouge region those six were No. 5 Florida, No. 24 South Carolina, No. 13 Washington, No. 4 Duke, No. 20 Oregon, and No. 37 Brigham Young.
“It was a good week for sure,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “I knew the team was capable of good things. I always think our ranking is going to be lower than where our actual level of play is at.”
Harvard’s round one 308 put the team in 12th place after the first day of competition. The Crimson followed this up with its best round of the tournament, firing a 295 on Friday,  but the team was unable to pick up any ground due to the performances of other teams.
On Saturday, Harvard closed out with a 301, cementing a final tally of 904.
The top four teams shattered the old 54-hole record for lowest score since the course was renovated in 2010. The previous record was set by Tennessee at 880 during the LSU Golf Classic in 2012.
The Crimson played best on par four holes, averaging 4.25 strokes per hole, good enough for seventh among the field. Harvard also had the fifth most even-par scores on holes with 166, just one behind the Blue Devils.
Harvard came into play seeded 15th of the 18 squads. The ninth place finish was the largest improvement over initial seeding for any school in the tournament.
“I really think that if things fall right in a year, we could potentially make it to Nationals,” Rhoads said. “If we have a team of equal strength, committed players who know what it takes to win, and we just play a tiny bit better I do think the team is capable of doing it.”
The University Club, measuring at 6,285 yards, played at a par 72 for the event. The regional round featured 54 holes of play, 18 each Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
Rounding out the top ten were seventh place finisher No. 33 Houston, eighth place No. 10 Arizona State, and No. 28 East Carolina, which tied with Harvard at ninth.
On the individual side, the top three players who are not on teams already qualifying for Nationals advance to that tournament as individuals.
Crimson freshman Anna Zhou, finishing tied for 12th at even par and was just one stroke behind that threshold. LSU’s Elise Bradley, Arizona State’s No. 15 Linnea Storm, and Houston’s Leonie Harm will be the trio heading to Eugene.
“We don’t really get intimidated going up against top ranked teams in these tournaments,” Zhou said. “We’ve seen a lot of those players in junior golf so it’s good to see them again, and it’s pretty easy for us to just go about our business.”
Fellow freshman Michelle Xie’s round three 74 moved her 12 spots up the leaderboard into a tie for 51st that included Arizona State’s No. 3 Monica Vaughn.
Also competing for Harvard were sophomore Lita Guo, captain Christine Lin, and junior Anne Cheng.
Comprising the remainder of the field was No. 48 LSU, No. 30 North Carolina State, No. 44 Augusta, North Florida, Denver, New Mexico, Wichita State, and Fairleigh Dickinson.
“Next season we’re just going to follow the same process and try to keep bettering ourselves throughout the season,” Zhou said. “We have a lot of confidence and hopefully that can take us a bit further next year.”
Harvard will be returning most of its team next season with two seniors graduating this spring.
“To be losing our team captain in Christine and also losing Courtney are huge losses for us,” Rhoads said. “They’ve played key roles on our team for the last four years and had a ton of success so they’re really irreplaceable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in as many weeks, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team found itself locked in a tight battle with conference rivals No. 7/6 Yale. And for the second straight time, it was the Bulldogs who dominated the fourth quarter, ending the game on a big run to secure the win.
Two Saturdays ago, Yale junior midfielder Eric Scott took over the contest, scoring or assisting on four goals in the final quarter to lead his team to a 9-8, comeback win. This past Sunday, with the stakes raised as the two squads battled in the Ivy League tournament final, it was sophomore attacker Ben Reeves who stepped up.
Reeves, four days after being named a First Team All-Ivy selection, did not score in the fourth, but had two key assists to help the Bulldogs crack open a one-goal game and pull away. The Crimson had closed the gap to 10-9 with 12:54 remaining, but with his composed decision-making and field vision, Reeves guided his team to the tourney title.
“He’s a really dynamic attackman,” Harvard co-captain and defender Stephen Jahelka said. “His ability to dodge to score and also pass put a lot of pressure on our defense. Yale did an impressive job on capitalizing off of his feeds and generated a lot of offense that way.”
Yale (13-2, 5-1 Ivy) ultimately pushed the lead up to 14-9 to capture the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. The Crimson (8-8, 3-3 Ivy) never fell behind by more than two goals until late in the fourth quarter, but could not carry the momentum from its upset win over No. 2/2 Brown to another marquee victory over the Bulldogs.
“Our guys left it all on the field today,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “There’s really not much else I could have asked for out of them. We just didn’t make the plays when it counted.”
En route to their third straight conference tournament title, the Bulldogs started strong, racing out to a 3-1 lead within seven minutes of the first whistle. Harvard battled back to tie the game at 4-4, and the advantage continued to shift back and forth throughout the first half.
Reeves put his big-play ability on display right from the start, tallying the opening score. He had two goals and two assists by halftime, before having an even better second half and finishing with game highs of four goals and five assists.
Yale senior midfielder Michael Keasey, another First Team All-Ivy selection, also played a big role in the first 30 minutes with a hat trick. His goal as time expired in the second quarter sent his team into halftime with a 7-6 lead and all of the momentum on its side.
The Crimson continued to battle as the game went on, however, hitting back with goals every time the Bulldogs threatened to pull away in the third quarter. Unlike on Friday, when the team rode a career night from sophomore attacker Morgan Cheek, the struggle against Yale was a team effort.
“We aren’t one player, obviously, and quite a few different guys contributed today,” Wojcik said. “That’s what we expect though, for everyone to show up, whether on the score sheet or not.”
Seven players found the back of the net for Harvard, and six got on the score sheet for assists. Senior attacker Devin Dwyer led his side with two apiece for a total of four points, and it was his goal with 13:37 left in the third quarter that tied the game.
Yale hit back through Reeves, and never trailed again. Despite three man-up opportunities in the fourth quarter, the Crimson could not maintain enough possession to keep the game close.
“In the fourth quarter, they won some key faceoffs and took advantage of some sloppy clears and ball handling,” Jahelka said. “As in the first game, they were very deliberate in their offense, which took time off the clock and also usually ended with points on the board.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another year, another Ivy championship.
Over the weekend, the Harvard women’s track and field team brought home its third consecutive outdoor Ivy League Heptagonal title. The Crimson women scored 160 total points and beat out Princeton and Cornell, who finished with 139 and 107 points, respectively.
With the victory, the squad has remained undefeated in both indoor and outdoor Ivy League championships since 2013, continuing one of the most dominant periods for the Harvard women in its history.
“We just tried to bring some ferocity and competitive energy this weekend,” co-captain Autumne Franklin said. “We definitely did that and ended up having a great meet.”
Meanwhile, the men’s squad tied for sixth place, slightly off the fifth place finish the team claimed at the indoor championships in February.
“I was really pleased with the way the men and women teams competed,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “Heps is an incredibly exciting meet—great competition, and there were a number of outstanding performers.”
The women’s performance was highlighted by wins in multiple individual events from Franklin, freshman Gabby Thomas, and junior two-time indoor All-American Nikki Okwelogu.
Thomas took home the gold medal in the 200-meter and 100-meter dash and the bronze medal in the long jump. Her times in the 100-meter of 11.55 and 200-meter of 23.38 were meet records—not surprising, perhaps, given that Thomas currently owns the Ivy record in both events.
“Gabby’s persevered and really worked hard and bought into what coach Tolbert has been preaching all year round,” coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s obviously paying big dividends for her.”
Classmate Ngozi Musa finished right behind Thomas in the 100-meter, claiming second with a time of 11.80.
Musa and Thomas were also members of the winning 4x100 relay, which—in addition to the two freshmen—consisted of junior Jade Miller and Franklin. The relay team finished in 44.85 seconds, sixth-tenths of a second better than the second-place time.
Franklin and Miller also finished a close one-two, respectively, in both the 100-meter and the 400-meter hurdles. In the former, Franklin’s time of 13.44 broke her own Harvard record—that she set back in early April—and edged out Miller’s time of 13.89.
Senior Madison Hansen finished third in the 100-meter hurdles, behind Franklin and Miller, with a time of 14.11 seconds. Hansen also claimed victory in the heptathlon with a point total of 5530 points.
In the 400-meter hurdles, Franklin won in a time of 55.87, ahead of Miller—the two-time defending Ivy champion in the event—who claimed second in a time of 56.44. Cornell’s Taysia Radoslav took third in 56.48 seconds, the only other time below the minute mark.
Radoslav’s third-place time was more than four seconds ahead of the fourth place time, and all three times finished ahead of the meet record of 57.30 seconds, set last year by Miller.
“Winning both events was definitely a goal I had going into the meet,” Franklin said.
“It feels really good and really special.”
Indeed, it was a special meet for both Franklin and co-captain Paige Kouba, who claimed victory in the 3000-meter steeplechase with a time of 10:05.30. Kouba also finished third in the 1500-meter run.
In the throws, Okwelogu cruised to wins in the discus and shot put, with her throw in the latter of 56’3” more than ten feet better than the second place effort.
On the men’s side, the Crimson’s lone victory came in the 4x800-meter relay—an event which Harvard also won at the indoor championships.
Freshman Myles Marshall ran the final leg of the relay, helping the team overcome a half second deficit at the 2400 meter mark.
“Myles is a special talent, and the sky’s the limit [for him],” Saretsky said. “The biggest thing for us is that we want him to continue to work hard and improve.”
Elsewhere, junior Efe Uwaifo took home silver in the triple jump with a leap of 15.79 meters. Fellow junior Julian Nunally claimed sixth in both the discus throw and shot put.
The Crimson men also took home fourth-place finishes in the pole vault and 110-meter hurdles, courtesy of junior Andrew Roney and sophomore Jay Hebert, respectively.
