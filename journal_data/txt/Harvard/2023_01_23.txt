After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few airlines receive as much negative media attention as Spirit.
From the countless comedic TikToks recording violent turbulences, to social media travel influencers recommending the airline due primarily to its cheap prices, Spirit’s practices are the center of popular discourse. Despite the somewhat condescending looks I get from classmates every time the conversation of traveling back and forth to campus comes up, I proudly fly Spirit Airlines. As you book your own plane tickets — for home, school, or anywhere else your travels take you — you should consider joining me on the infamous, low-cost airline.
In some sense, Spirit’s bad reputation is not without merit. The airline is rightly criticized for its misleading fee system, which shows you a low price — called a “bare fare” — but has a substantial catch: The price you see frequently includes only a small personal item and the flight ticket. Whereas most major airlines permit both a carry-on and a personal item for free, Spirit charges for each piece of luggage beyond the singular personal item, with higher fees for each additional bag.
The hidden fees don’t stay at the gate, though. Spirit Airlines offers no complimentary snacks for flights, and selecting your seat can cost you up to $200, according to their website. It’s even as if the website is designed to confuse people by complicating the process of declining any of these extra services: For example, users must click “continue without seats” to move forward with the complimentary random seat option.
Beyond its online confusion tactics, Spirit’s seats are also uncomfortable, to say the least. They can’t recline, can lack padding, and reportedly have fewer inches of leg space than other airlines. Even when you fork over as much as $250, all you get is a measly six inches of extra legroom, leaving you with the option of spending lots of money on a still-uncomfortable seat.
Spirit is far from perfect — in fact, it might not even be good. But Spirit is what I have. As a homesick, broke college student willing to take any opportunity to leave the Harvard bubble, choosing the wallet-friendly flight is my only choice.
Choosing Spirit has never been about flying in luxury — with reclinable seats, access to premium entertainment, and complimentary nuts — and we shouldn't judge it in those terms. Instead, it means valuing the destination more than the journey. It is about spending a few hours in an uncomfortable seat for the sake of spending time with friends and family. And once you arrive, you can spend those extra dollar bills at your destination — together.
The stigmatization of choosing Spirit reflects just how lost our priorities are. Harvard students are too keen to criticize individuals for making unfashionable choices without considering the context that leads to them or how well they contribute to achieving their ultimate goals. Many low-income students are forced by financial necessity to choose between comfort and an airline like Spirit. When it’s time to decide between temporary comfort, such as that of choosing to fly in a higher class or on a better airline, or making a more frugal decision that the privileged take for granted, low-income students are wired to select the latter option. At Harvard, we have fallen too deeply into a culture of criticizing, in which we unknowingly make comments that further foment class divisions and alienate the unprivileged. While it may seem harmless, we are slowly drifting away from the essential kindness, compassion, and gratitude that keep our communities together.
I grew up in a household that understands the value of temporary sacrifice for a fruitful future. It is the cornerstone of our philosophy as immigrants, built on the memory of leaving behind the comfort of one home for the better life offered by another. It has been the cornerstone for my success as a student, the spirit that pulls me through long nights of studying. And, notwithstanding those awful, awful seats, it gives me the strength to choose Spirit. I can sacrifice a few hours of comfort for the family members who sacrificed their lives back at home for my well-being.
I don’t usually mind the snarky, admittedly funny comments about Spirit. But before you make the next one, aim your judgement at the airline — for failing to provide snacks, baggage, and comfort to its passengers — and reserve your kindness for your peers who are excited to reach their destination, unfazed by the bumpy but affordable ride.

Welcome one, and welcome all
It’s great to have you here.
This will be my column
For the next, like, half a year.
“What’s with all the rhymes?” you ask
“You sound like you are three.”
First of all, rude.
And second, wait and see.

I’ve noticed something worrisome
It’s really quite mysterious
that many Harvard undergrads
Are simply far too serious!
They only read the classics.
And work themselves to death
They hope for Goldman Sachs and Bain
With tense and baited breath.
The Ivies are notorious
For hyper-toxic vibes
They’re so hard to get into
Some rich folks resort to bribes!
But all that competition means
That students can feel trapped
Like if they don’t speak Shakespeare
Then they’ll never quite adapt!

This column is an argument
Against all that BS
Rhyming is a weapon
I will use to self-express!
I hope that people read this
And realize it’s okay
To take themselves less seriously
And add fun to their day.

I have a great semester planned!
From final clubs to school,
We’ll touch on all things Harvard.
And if you’re like, “That’s not cool.”
Just know that rhymes are learning tools.
They worked when you were two.
And though you have regressed since then,
They just might work anew.

So what’s this first piece all about?
What’s column number one?
People at this school, it seems,
Feel guilty having fun.
They start their econ homework,
Then pause to watch a show.
But after that they’ll curse their
Lazy asses. “No, Chad, No!
You fool! You numb nut!
You’ve wasted so much time!
Goldman Sachs will hate you
If you watch more Shonda Rhimes!”
Then they drink a Red Bull
And as penance, they stay up
Till 5:30 in the morning.
Is this unproductive? Yup!

As students we are busy,
And rarely have the time
To do things just for fun
Like watch a show or write a rhyme! (wink)
Harvard’s reputation
Of academic clout
Enforces this reality
By filling us with doubt:
“Should I start my essay?
I haven’t had lunch yet….
I really need some sleep
But I should start the next pset!”

Because there’s always work to do,
And we all want success,
We often forgo pleasure
Which results in undue stress.
But here’s a little secret
That psychology supports:
Too long without a break,
creates problems – Times reports.

Taking breaks is healthy.
It helps prevent fatigue!
So don’t feel guilty taking time
To check that football league.
Studies show that taking breaks
And time away from work
Creates healthy long term habits
That we otherwise might shirk.
Like sleep! And exercise!
And human interaction!
Science says that rested folks
Have “higher satisfaction.”

Psychologically,
The human brain is built to wander
We can focus ≈40 minutes
Then our brain will quit its ponder!
So pushing through is by no means
The “best” thing we should do
Guilt’s not necessary—
take some time that’s just for you!

But for you workaholics,
Know there’s grade benefits, too
Work tends to be better when
Your brain is fresh and new
Taking time to hang with friends
Or doing things you like
Is not anti-productive,
It makes ideas spike!

And of course, for mental health,
Some fun breaks are required!
They help us to escape
The stressful patterns we’ve got wired.
Knowing it’s important
To do things that we enjoy
Will help us live our lives here
With more happiness and joy.

Does that mean we should never work?
Or party every night?
Nah bro, make smart choices
And I swear you’ll be alright.
My point here is, a show or two?
A day that’s just for fun?
It certainly won’t kill you
And will help in the long run.

So if, to save your mental health,
You need to take a break.
Then girl, you should do it!
At least, do it for my sake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“How come you never speak Spanish?” Usually, I only tell people half the story: My parents just never taught me. Usually, I hide the fact that I’ve been slowly learning Spanish on my own time, too embarrassed about my poor Spanish to actually practice it. But nobody wants to hear that — they’d rather tell me I’m agringado or a “no sabo kid” or “not a real Mexican.”
As far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I had to explain that I didn’t “get in because of my last name” ten minutes after receiving my Harvard acceptance. As far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I was unable to shake the anxiety of Uvalde in the crowd at Carnaval in San Francisco last May. And as far as I could tell, I was “a real Mexican” when I felt relieved to learn that my dad had been too sick to go to the Gilroy Garlic Festival as he had planned. After all, the racist mass shooter would have targeted someone who looked like him.
The truth is, I’m not alone — many Latines find that their language skills place them in a liminal space where they are “not quite Latine enough” for their own community, yet just Latine enough to be on the receiving end of racial hostility. However, this categorization overlooks the fact that countless Latines like me don’t speak Spanish for the most Latine reason possible: forced assimilation. The idea of conflating Latinidad with language is hardly a new one: The term Hispanic as understood today was coined by the United States Census Bureau; around the same time, the 1976 Public Law 94-311 defined this population for census data collection as those who “identify themselves as being of Spanish-speaking background and trace their origin or descent from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and other Spanish-speaking countries.”
No matter how prevalent it may become, “Hispanic” will always be a conceptually bankrupt term to me. Because “Hispanic” attempts to group people together solely based on the use of the Spanish language, it excludes people from Brazil, Haiti, and Belize, while including those from the country responsible for the colonization of most of Latin America: Spain. Clearly, this is a problem — it implies that there is no difference in the privileges of Spanish people and the people belonging to the countries Spain oppressed and stole from for centuries.
This is hardly a necessary evil; other definitions of Latinidad find unity in a combination of cultural identity, national origin in South and Central America or the Caribbean, colonial legacies, and lived experience against the backdrop of American society. In doing so, we can avoid lazily grouping the colonizer and the colonized together on the basis of a language Spaniards forced on Native Americans.
Even still, language is what connects us to our music, to our classmates, and even to our own families. It’s not hard to understand how Latines that were never taught to speak the language that defines their community (be it Spanish, Haitian Creole, or Quechua) might develop a cultural disconnect within their own communities, or even a sense of inadequacy. However, this is no excuse for portraying “no sabo kids” as “not Latine” — the reality is, Latines aren’t choosing to leave their native language behind. No, Latine languages aren’t being lost because their speakers are “lazy” or “want to be white.” Rather, we lose our languages when our speakers are criminalized for speaking their native language in the fundamentally Latine experience of forced assimilation.
While we might not want to define the Latine experience around the loss of language, the same could be said about our colonial history or labor exploitation — unfortunately, what it means to be Latine cannot so easily be disentangled from our community’s generational trauma. Much like our colonial history under European and North American forces, the United States government bears responsibility for much of this trauma: The erasure of the Spanish language can be traced back to a long history of forced assimilation, or “Americanization'' of Latines, exemplified by school segregation in Texas and California.
By 1931, 80 percent of school districts in Texas and California officially segregated Mexican children, sending them to schools deliberately designed to assimilate and exploit their students, training them for industrial, agricultural, and housekeeping work while neglecting to teach them basic reading and writing. Students at one such school in Texas even reported being beaten should they dare speak Spanish.
Despite this form of segregation being struck down in Mendez v. Westminster, the death of Mexican American schools left a loophole for future segregation: linguistic segregation. As a result, in Arizona today, the de facto segregation of Spanish-speaking students is enforced, all while students are only allowed to be taught in English.
With 70 percent of the United States under the impression that it is very important to speak English to be “truly American,” it’s clear that this forced assimilation isn’t going to end anytime soon — suggesting continued massive impacts on Latines. When so much of the country sees speaking Spanish as “un-American” and random Latines are yelled at for using their native language, it should come as no surprise that many parents decide not to teach their children to speak Spanish. The resulting “no sabo kids” certainly deserve Latinidad; we lost our language as a result of forced assimilation — a key part of the Latine experience.
Even still, many “no sabo kids” find hope in language reclamation. Notably, Selena and Julián Castro have chosen this path themselves, effectively acknowledging that, while much is lost with our language, much can be regained by learning that same language, even decades into your life. While the harm of forced assimilation cannot be overlooked or forgotten, language reclamation represents a path forward. It offers us a place to call home and the opportunity to replace a missed connection with a new relationship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association approved a two month delay of their elections timeline and the creation of a new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Board during a constitutional review meeting in preparation for the spring term on Friday.
Both proposals will be brought to a majority vote before the HUA’s executive board at their weekly meeting next Sunday, and if approved, will be brought to a student referendum vote during this year’s election cycle. Under the current constitution, HUA elections for each of the nine officer positions, including the co-presidents, occur during the third week of the spring semester.
During the meeting, HUA members voted to shift the weeklong election process to exactly two weeks after the end of spring break.
“Having that election in the third week really does not provide a lot of time for students to be able to understand, ‘Oh, this is something I really want to do,’” HUA co-president Travis A. Johnson ’24 said during the meeting. “We worry that it will discourage really qualified candidates from seeking election, because they may not even know that it’s happening because it is so quick after they return.”
The HUA also approved a proposal by co-presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Johnson for the creation of a DEI team. Some responsibilites of the proposed DEI team are currently being fulfilled by the HUA’s Well-Being Team, such as coordinating with the University’s Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. Johnson said the creation of the new board will ensure “nothing falls through the cracks.”
“This is a personal and professional priority of ours to ensure that DEI and inclusion efforts are enshrined in the HUA constitution,” Johnson said in an interview with The Crimson. “The creation of the inclusion team is not in response to any criticism from any student organization. It’s in fact something that we have always promised and pledged to do.”
Last September, Harvard Primus — a campus group for first-generation, low-income students — accused the HUA of rejecting Primus’s efforts to establish a dedicated DEI team, an allegation Estabine and Johnson denied at the time.
Johnson said he and Estabine waited to propose the DEI team because the constitution required they wait until the spring election cycle to conduct a referendum on the team’s creation and to appoint an officer to head it.
“I know that there were some concerns about the expediency with which we could create this type of team,” Estabine said. “It’s a change that we have been planning to implement, but there are things with the constitution that we have to consider when we’re making these decisions so that they are constitutionally sound.”
Johnson also encouraged students who feel strongly about an issue to directly bring their ideas to HUA’s executive team in addition to engaging in other forms of activism.
“LyLena and I are always happy to meet with students or student groups about issues they are particularly passionate about, or things they want to see happen. At the very minimum, we will promise to respond and set up a meeting,” he said. “As students, as leaders, we may disagree on approaches, but at the very minimum, we’re always excited to hear people out and listen to the ideas that they have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year after Harvard pledged to divest its endowment from fossil fuels, an alumni group is calling on the University to turn down research funding from companies with ties to the fossil fuel industry.
In a report released Wednesday, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard Alumni recommended that Harvard ban research departments from accepting funds from companies tied to fossil fuels and increase transparency around potential conflicts of interest involving the industry.
In September 2021, after years of public pressure, Harvard said it would move to divest its endowment from fossil fuels. Still, organizers with FFDHA said they hope to see Harvard implement further initiatives to address climate change.
“We don’t think that the work is finished,” said FFDHA organizer Melanie Y. Wang ’15.
The report alleges that researchers who receive funding from groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry may face conflicts of interest in framing research questions and reporting their findings.
According to the report, some of Harvard’s “most problematic fossil fuel ties” are within climate and environmental policy programs at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government and Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. These financial connections include ties to Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell, the report claims.
“I was a student studying Environmental Science and Public Policy at Harvard, and I saw firsthand that there were centers and professors who took money from the fossil fuel industry to fund their activities and research,” FFDHA organizer Caleb D. Schwartz ’20 said. “I felt like that was a problem.”
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith did not respond to a request for comment.
Schwartz said FFDHA stands in a unique position as a group of alumni because members can vote for candidates for the Board of Overseers, one of Harvard’s two governing boards.
“We feel like as alums who are not directly employed by the University or aren’t directly students of the University, we have a little bit more freedom to do this sort of work and be vocal about it without risking consequences,” Schwartz said.
In the report, FFDHA also demanded more transparency from Harvard around the sources of funding for its academic research.
FFDHA said in the report that they made 104 inquiries into Harvard departments and institutes about fossil fuel ties. According to Wang, “only about a quarter of the departments that we reached out to responded to us,” of which the “vast majority” declined to disclose the requested information.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on FFDHA’s report.
Wang said the lack of transparency on sources of research funding challenges Harvard’s credibility surrounding its climate goals.
“We really feel that in order to be the climate leader that the University is trying to position itself as, making these or establishing clarity around these kinds of policies is critical to protect academic integrity and the quality of research,” Wang said.
Other organizations on campus — including the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, and Harvard Faculty for Divestment — have endorsed FFDHA’s report. Divestment and sustainability groups at Stanford and Princeton have also signed on in support.
“Harvard’s white paper really sets a higher bar for advancing the fossil-free research movement,” said June Choi, a Ph.D candidate and sustainability organizer at Stanford.
Alex H. Norbrook, an undergraduate organizer at Divest Princeton, emphasized the importance of a “unified front” in the movement for fossil fuel divestment.
Going forward, Wang said FFDHA has contacted the University’s two governing boards — the Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers — as well as University Provost Alan F. Garber ’76 in hopes of starting a “concrete conversation.”
Schwartz remains hopeful that Harvard can “be a leader” in combating climate change.
“We sincerely want Harvard to be the leader it claims to be and wants to be, and we want Harvard to get this right because we don’t get a redo with the climate crisis,” he said. “We have to do it right.”

When Mansfield, Massachusetts-based martial artist Deb A. Zion woke up one morning after a long and difficult night of kung fu, she said she found herself unable to move her arms.
Feeling the soreness from her training and the toll of years of practicing martial arts on her body, Zion was unsure how much longer she would be able to meet kung fu’s physical demands.
Searching for wisdom, she looked to her close friend Yon G. Lee for advice. Zion asked Lee, a master of kung fu and tai chi, when she would know that she was too old for the martial art.
But Lee surprised Zion with reassurance, telling her that she would never be too old and advising her to adapt kung fu to herself.
“That was a great piece of advice because I was at that point ready to step away from the arts because I’m like, ‘I’m too old. This is for young people. This is crazy for me to try to do this,’” Zion said. “But I adapted.”
Lee first coached kung fu at Harvard in 1986, and he eventually became the University’s chief instructor of kung fu and tai chi. In all, he spent more than three decades at Harvard. Lee was also a beloved affiliate in Adams House, which he joined in 1997.
Lee died from Parkinson’s disease on Jan. 6 at the age of 74.
Former Adams House Faculty Deans Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 described Lee as a generous and loving person who was always interested in the lives of his many friends in Adams House and beyond.
“He did bring life to anything you did with him,” Sean Palfrey said.
Zion recalled making a “big mistake” the first time she trained in kung fu with Lee, whose small frame she described as “98 pounds soaking wet.”
“I was trying to be gentle because I see this little guy,” she said. “Next thing I know, I am tied up in a knot and I didn’t even know what got me.”
Lee was a master of kung fu and tai chi — a meditative form of kung fu that focuses on the proper flow of one’s energy, or chi, throughout their body, Zion said.
Timothy J. LaVallee, a martial artist and longtime friend of Lee, remembered Lee as an exceptional teacher of tai chi who could explain its complex nature in ways that made sense to his students.
“On the one hand, you’re learning how to defend yourself and you’re learning how to use your body as a weapon. But on the other hand, you’re also learning how to fix stuff,” he said. “And so he was constantly using math and physics as a way of trying to explain and understand both the martial art aspect of it and the healing aspect.”
Andrew J. Green ’99 said he began taking Lee’s classes as refuge from the stress of life as a college student. He said the classes provided balance “intellectually, and emotionally, and interpersonally.”
“It gives one a centering, where you can be in the middle of whatever chaos is going on around you and it’s okay,” he said.
Former Adams resident Eboni C. White ’17 recalled the way that Lee would serendipitously teach others around him new skills. White, who had then just begun learning how to throw knives, recalled Lee approaching her to teach her a new technique after she had finished a practice.
“He showed me these videos of tai chi masters throwing chopsticks through cement,” she said. “And so, long story short, he ended up teaching me how to throw my knives in a way that it looked like an accident.”
“That’s part of the reason why I think he was so endearing,” she added. “He’s not gonna be like, ‘Oh, that’s dangerous.’ It’s more just like, ‘If you’re gonna do it, do it right.’”
Zion, who said Lee is part of her “kung fu family,” will remember Lee as a “great martial artist.”
“The martial arts world is one short of a great one,” she said.
An immigrant from China, Lee was dedicated to fostering cultural exchange between his birthplace and the United States.
“He wanted the Chinese culture and the Chinese people to be seen by us in the United States. That was his passion,” said retired Adams House cook Edward B. Childs.
Born in Taishan City, China in 1948, Lee moved to Boston when he was 10. He graduated from Brandeis in 1973, where he studied physics and went abroad to the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Lee later received a master’s degree in nuclear physics from Northeastern.
Part of Lee’s effort to foster connections between the U.S. and China included setting up a scholarship program to fund an exchange program for students in Harvard and China. The program, led by Lee, provided groups of Harvard students the opportunity to learn about Chinese culture as emissaries in Beijing or Dengfeng.
Sean Palfrey, who made two trips to China, credits Lee’s friendliness for the warm welcome the delegations from Harvards received from their hosts.
“He has, obviously, a lot of connections there, both friends and family and artists,” he said. “We were greeted everywhere. There were times that we literally would go into a small town and across the street at the entrance of the town, it said ‘Welcome, Yon Lee and Dr. Sean Palfrey from Harvard.’”
Lee also brought students, educators, and artists from China to Adams. On one occasion, he welcomed the abbot of the Shaolin Temple, a renowned monastery recognized as the birthplace of Chan Buddhism and Shaolin kung fu.
“He was a guy who made friends extremely easily and saw himself as really this ambassador, not just between Boston and Chinatown, but between this region and China,” Sean Palfrey said.
“He would say, ‘coming with a bunch of my friends.’ That might be anywhere between 20 and 100. You never knew who would come,” he added.
In Boston, Lee also served as Mayor’s Liaison to the Chinese Community under former mayor Raymond L. Flynn, who credited Lee with progress in countering gang violence in the city’s Chinatown during the late ’80s and early ’90s.
LaVallee said Lee was “always looking for an opportunity to bring folks together from different places.”
“He wanted to make sure that the community at the University — the students — had an opportunity to experience this stuff from people from around the world, instead of just himself,” LaVallee said.
When the Palfreys began their tenure as Adams House faculty deans in 1999, they said they were impressed by the commitment that Lee brought to the house.
“We sort of thought there was a building and there were some students, and we had no idea that there actually were these wonderful people who were committed to being part of the community,” Judith Palfrey said.
“It was just a charming partnership with this man in every sort of setting,” Sean Palfrey added.
Childs said he and the rest of the dining hall staff carried “tremendous” respect for Lee, who regularly invited them to his kung fu classes and house events.
Once, Lee trained the Adams dining staff to cook traditional Chinese food for a Lunar New Year celebration in the house, Childs said.
“We had traditional foods, all traditional recipes, from scallion pancakes to the gravies, the sauces, how to cut the Chinese broccoli — everything,” Childs said. “The big thing was he trained us, and he did it with passion, and it was obviously excellent.”
Judith Palfrey said Lee had a “knee-jerk” reaction to help others, citing his help in organizing a vigil for Adams affiliates after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
“By noon that day, there were no candles anywhere in Cambridge and Boston, and Yon got wind of that. And he went to every suburban little town and place himself,” she said. “He came back just in time with exactly the right number of candles.”
Green, one of Lee’s former kung fu students, called him “the real deal.”
“He took each student as they were and helped give them, I think, the inner strength and the outer physical strength to grow and become who they needed to be at Harvard,” Green said.

Sushma Raman is set to step down as executive director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy on Feb. 10 after serving more than seven years in the role.
Raman will be taking on a new role as the president and CEO of the Heising-Simons Foundation, an organization based in California that works to advance sustainable energy, support research, and advance human rights. During her time as director, Raman played a crucial role in launching the Carr Center’s Racial Justice program and Technology and Human Rights program.
The Carr Center is finalizing an interim director who will serve in the role while HKS searches for the Carr Center’s sixth director. Mathias Risse, the faculty director of the Carr Center, first announced the news of Raman’s departure in an email to HKS affiliates on Jan. 11.
“For almost a decade Sushma has held together the center,” Risse wrote. “Her deep intelligence, her broad knowledge, and her inexhaustible energy have meant everything to the center, to me personally, and I am sure in many ways to you as well.”
The Carr Center became the subject of controversy this month after HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf denied a fellowship to human rights expert Kenneth Roth, who alleges the decision was due to his criticism of Israel. Amid backlash and calls for resignation, Elmendorf reversed his decision and offered Roth a fellowship.
Raman did not comment on whether the fellowship decision played a role in her exit.
Raman joined the Carr Center as executive director in 2015 after serving as Program Officer of the Ford Foundation for five years, where she launched and managed a $100 million global philanthropy initiative with a focus on women’s rights and social justice.
Raman wrote in a statement that she is grateful for her years at the Carr Center, where she had the opportunity to work with an “incredible community of faculty, fellows, students, and supporters to build the current strategic framework and research programs.”
“I've tried throughout my career to center the perspectives of those most affected by human rights violations and by racial and gender injustice,” she wrote. “I've tried to bring a sense of humility and compassion to my work.”
During the pandemic, Raman led the Carr Center’s transition from in-person to online events. Raman directed and served as host of the Carr Center’s Justice Matters podcast, which investigates human rights issues in the United States and abroad.
“We deeply appreciate the vital contributions Sushma has made to the Carr Center and to the Kennedy School over her decade with us,” HKS spokesperson James F. Smith wrote. “We wish her all the best in her continuing important work in the field of human rights.”
Raman wrote that her new role is a “once in a lifetime opportunity” that will allow her to build on her prior experience in launching social change initiatives.
“I think the Carr Center will continue to play an important role for the Harvard student body, as well as the broader human rights movement, and I look forward to staying connected for the years to come,” she wrote.
Correction: January 31, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sushma Raman had departed her role as executive director of the Carr Center. In fact, though Raman’s departure was announced on Jan. 11, she will continue as executive director until Feb. 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team faces a daunting schedule in the coming weeks, with home games against No. 16 Cornell and No. 1 Quinnipiac preceding the first round of the Beanpot Tournament against No. 18 Boston College. Despite returning key players to the lineup in the past few weeks, including senior forward and captain John Farinacci, the Crimson is still searching for consistency as it looks to move past a mixed winter break and hit its stride through a challenging schedule.
“I think we're still forming some chemistry and different combinations,” head coach Ted Donato said. “We have to be able to…find different ways to be successful when teams try to be very sound defensively and clog up the neutral zone. I think we’ve got to find a way to…use our speed to get in on forechecks and be able to play and generate offensive chances that way.”
In its first game back from winter break on December 30, the Crimson battled the No. 5 Boston University Terriers at Walter Brown Arena in a top-10 showdown. Terriers forward Quinn Hutson scored on the power play just over two minutes into the game, but senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson and BU goaltender Drew Commesso quickly took control. Despite allowing the early goal, Gibson put together an exceptional performance, and Commesso matched him save for save until a late tying goal from sophomore forward Matthew Coronato. Despite Harvard forcing overtime late in the third period, Terriers captain Domenick Fensore scored off the rush with less than a minute remaining in OT, securing a hard-fought 2-1 win for BU.
“I felt like we battled, but I don't think we were as sharp as we could have been,” said Donato on the loss to the Terriers.
Despite suffering a difficult defeat less than 48 hours earlier, Harvard started 2023 on a strong note, defeating the Northeastern University Huskies 8-4 in front of a sold-out home crowd on New Year’s Day. Six different Crimson players scored, including junior forward Ryan Drkulec and first-year forward Philip Tresca, who each recorded their first collegiate goals. Despite Harvard controlling play early and maintaining a 3-0 advantage early in the second period, the Huskies quickly came to life, tying the game by the late stages of the period. However, late second-period goals from first-year forwards Casey Severo and Joe Miller restored the Crimson advantage, and Tresca and junior forward Alex Laferriere put the finishing touches on the victory in the third period.
Harvard began its first road trip of 2023 against the Princeton Tigers on January 6. After a scoreless first period, the Tigers took control in the second period, riding two goals from captain Liam Gorman to a 3-0 lead entering the final 20 minutes of action. However, the Crimson refused to go away quietly. Coronato cut into the deficit on the power play midway through the third period, and goals from Miller and Coronato 16 seconds apart late in regulation sent the game to OT tied at 3-3. In overtime, an outstanding individual effort from Laferriere provided the game-winner, completing Harvard’s comeback and the Crimson’s season sweep of the Tigers.
Despite the thrilling win over Princeton, Harvard’s momentum ground to a halt the next night against the Quinnipiac Bobcats. The Bobcats, currently ranked No. 1 in the NCAA, are second nationally in goals per game and first in goals-against per game. Quinnipiac put two goals on the board in the first period, creating offense on a partial breakaway and off a well-executed give-and-go. The Bobcats extended their lead in the second period by cleaning up a lively rebound in front of the net, and while sophomore forward Alex Gaffney pulled the Crimson within two with a goal early in the third period, Quinnipiac goaltender Yaniv Perets, who ranks fourth in the nation with a 1.75 goals-against average, slammed the door on a potential comeback with a strong third period, handing Harvard its first defeat of 2023.
“Quinnipiac I thought played a very good game,” Donato said. “We weren't able to get enough going in the first few periods to be able to not chase the game.”
Back at home on January 13, Harvard overcame an early deficit to defeat Clarkson University 4-1. Junior goaltender Derek Mullahy, seeing his first action since November, posted an excellent performance, saving 25 of 26 shots. Farinacci also rejoined the lineup for his first action of the season, recording two power play assists in his return from injury.
“Feels nice to be back, with a long, long couple of months being out. Physically feeling a lot better,” Farinacci said. “There's nothing like playing games.”
Within the first six minutes of the game, Thrun was forced to the box for interference and gave the Golden Knights a power play, which they converted via a goal by All-American Alex Campbell. Coronato responded immediately, capitalizing on Harvard’s first power play to tie the game at 1-1 after the first period. The Crimson dominated the second period with 19 shots on goal, but Clarkson goaltender Ethan Haider kept the onslaught at bay. Harvard continued the offensive aggression into the third period, starting with a power play advantage carried over from the end of the second. Again the Crimson capitalized, as junior forward Sean Farrell put Harvard in front 2-1. Goals from Gaffney and Miller later in the third period provided critical insurance, giving the Crimson a 4-1 victory in its captain’s return to action.
“John is a real important part of our group…he's been a leader for us and a real productive player all over the place in all situations; an older, more mature center-iceman that's been through some big games, whether that's in the league or even U.S. World Juniors,” Donato said.
The following night, with Mullahy again between the posts, the Crimson welcomed the St. Lawrence Saints to Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Harvard started with a dominant first period, scoring three goals on 13 shots, with Farrell tallying two goals and Miller recording one. Miller and first-year defenseman Ryan Healey capped off the scoring with second period goals, and Mullahy continued his strong weekend in net, posting 23 saves for his first career shutout.
“I think that we've had some guys in and out of the lineup, which a lot of teams do, but I thought we made a step in the right direction last weekend,” Donato said.
In the Crimson’s second meeting of the season with Yale on January 20th, Harvard took down the Bulldogs in a 3-2 OT win. With Gibson back in net after a weekend off, the Bulldogs gave the Crimson all they could handle, taking the first lead of the game midway through the first period. Harvard failed to respond for the remainder of the first, but came out swinging in the second, with goals from Miller and first-year defenseman Mason Langenbrunner (the first of his career) putting the Crimson back in front. Yale tied the game four minutes later, and after a scoreless third period, the bitter rivals headed for overtime tied at 2-2. After a back-and-forth extra session, Coronato tallied the winning goal with 19 seconds to play, using a series of moves in the crease to slide home the game-winner and secure Harvard’s season sweep of the Bulldogs.
Despite the thrilling victory on Friday, Harvard fell flat in a Saturday night defeat against the Brown Bears. Brown came out quick, scoring within the first three minutes of the game. However, Farrell answered less than a minute later, recording his 14th goal and 29th point of the season. The game remained tied until the second period, when the Bears potted two goals to claim a 3-1 advantage heading into the third period. The Crimson turned up the pressure on Brown in the third, outshooting the Bears 19-2, but despite a late tally from Farrell, Brown held on for a 3-2 victory.
“I think we're still trying to find the proper recipe to find consistent success,” Donato said.
With players moving in and out of the lineup, Harvard’s line combinations have frequently been in flux, but Farinacci believes the team’s strong chemistry will make any adjustments seamless.
“We're all pretty close on the team…you can kind of throw anybody together and kind of make things happen, which I think is a great part about our team,” Farinacci said. “Whatever comes our way, I think everybody's kind of ready for it.”
Harvard has a two game homestand this upcoming weekend, taking on ECAC rivals Colgate and Cornell. Both will bring competitive hockey to Bright-Landry, especially on Saturday against longtime rival and No. 16 Cornell.
“Our guys will be excited to have these intense, emotional, important games coming up,” Donato said.

Curious what the start of spring semester will look like for you? Flyby’s amateur astrologists have got you covered. After watching many astrology TikToks staring at the stars for a long time, we can confidently conclude what you should be prioritizing as you get back into the swing of things. Don’t let the accuracy of our predictions scare you too much!
Aquarius 
While the start of the semester brings the strongest Sunday scaries, look on the bright side — it’s Aquarius season! You may have had a difficult Mercury retrograde these past few weeks, so give yourself time to start making sense of any mixed feelings that came up (at your raging birthday celebrations, of course). The new moon is in Aquarius, meaning that it is the perfect time to explore new opportunities. Take that novelty class that doesn’t actually count for your major! Well, let’s face it, you probably were going to take it anyway.
Pisces
We know, starting the new semester can be an emotional and anxiety-provoking undertaking. If you’re feeling the pressure, don’t worry! Take time to do some emotional healing (Harry Styles’ Calm meditation could be a great place to start) and channel any nervous energy into something creative. If you need ideas, performing in Battle for Yardfest could be a blast (and if you need a triangle player, do reach out, I would love to participate and my friends are lame).
Aries
After a jam-packed winter break you are… planning Spring Break already? That’s fair, we’re actually only 49 (don’t check our math) days away. Also, Jupiter has just entered Aries, a special and rare event, meaning that now’s a great time to start up a passion project, get pumped to start up classes, and develop resolutions to any past ~situations~ (we know how much you love your situations). With the sun in Aquarius, you may even be in a lighter mood, and we all thank the sun for that.
Taurus
Amid all the frantic back-to-school energy, you are, yet again, carrying your friend group’s sanity. We thank you for your service. However, make sure to take time to set concrete goals for the semester. If anyone can stick to something, it’s you (with a little help from Uranus, of course). Also, it seems like love is in the stars for you. We actually do not really know about that one won’t say more…
Gemini 
You may have had a difficult time choosing your classes or a crisis about your concentration choice. Let us be the first to reassure you: the emotional rollercoaster is so valid, and, in the wise words of Flyby’s favorite momager, “you’re doing amazing, sweetie.” Luckily, as we move out of Mercury retrograde (yes, we keep saying this; no, we don’t really know what it means), you will regain some clarity. And, perhaps recharge by reconnecting with friends after the break!
Cancer 
The beginning of the semester is all about relationships for you, dear Cancer. New classes? Old news. New people? Now that should be your focus. Let yourself be open to new connections—establish a pset group or identify your next section crush. However, with these new changes, don’t let yourself get too swayed by your feelings. Keep everything in perspective and try to go with the flow!
Leo 
You’ve renamed your private story for the new year. You’ve restocked your favorite skin care products. You’ve picked out your FDOC outfit. Slay. Just remember to look in the mirror (um, figuratively). Take some time to reflect and lean into self-discovery. Furthermore, with all the planets out of retrograde (sorry, it’s our new favorite word), now’s the perfect time to pick up a new hobby (crochet me a scarf!) or plan fun activities with friends.
Virgo
You’re psyching yourself up to take five classes. You’re adding important dates to the Gcal. You’re reading through every single word of the syllabus? Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but knowing the due date of pset 3 off the top of your head isn’t that important — well, we suppose it won’t hurt. The cold winter months may make you feel more reserved and isolated, so be sure to take the initiative to spend time with those who make you feel energetic and expressive. Note that with Jupiter in your eighth house, you will do best giving your energy to a few friends or projects (aka comping three new clubs = bad idea).
Libra 
Flyby’s amateur astrologists regretfully report that the start of the semester might be a tad rocky for our sweet Libras. Perhaps you didn’t get the class you wanted or you made awkward eye contact with an old fling. However, with the help of a little perspective shift and Jupiter, new love opportunities will begin brewing. Our expert recommendation: even if you have no one in mind yet, book something for Valentine’s Day. Restaurants fill up quickly, and we’re confident the stars will align for you ;)
Scorpio
As we start the new semester, you may feel inclined to enter your mysterious academic weapon era. We, and the planets, support you. While all those in Widener will certainly think you are quite cool and collected, you may actually begin feeling a bit sentimental and insecure. Be sure to take stock of your feelings and communicate them with others. With Mercury out of retrograde (it’s truly just so fun to say), you may find it easier to express yourself.
Sagittarius
Break your New Year’s resolution yet? Just kidding, we know you did. While your social calendar might be filling up with back-to-school functions, make sure you set aside time to set (and stick to!) some healthy habits for the semester. Weekly routines may seem dreadful (I’m a Sagittarius and generally unmotivated individual, so believe me, I know), but they will ultimately provide a centering complement to the crazy Sag lifestyle.
Capricorn
What did you do over break? More like, what are you doing over summer… 2024? After a fun birthday season, it’s back to the grind, and we’re proud that you’re hard at work securing your internship. Just be sure to take time to enjoy the beginning of the semester — take a nice winter walk with friends or find a new study space! And, with the sun in team-oriented Aquarius, derive energy from collaborating with others (networking counts, we guess).
Feeling called out? Don’t blame us, blame the stars. Still doubting our astrological powers? Just you wait... However, no matter what your horoscope reports, the semester really is in your hands and you’re going to kill it!
