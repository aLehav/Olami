After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 26, 2015, at 12:07 a.m.
With five out of 30 members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers about to complete their six-year terms, the University has named nominees for the next batch of alumni to serve on its second-highest governing body.
The Board of Overseers works in conjunction with the 13-member Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing board. The Corporation must obtain the Overseers’ approval for many major decisions affecting institutional policy and leadership, such the appointment of a new University president.
Overseers typically hail from many different professional fields, including law, finance, medicine, academia, and journalism. The eight current Overseer nominees are: R. Martin Chavez ’85, chief information officer and partner at Goldman Sachs; Fernande R. V. Duffly, associate justice on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court; Sandra Edgerley ’84, a board member of charitable organization the Boston Foundation and a Harvard donor; Brian Greene ’84, a physics and mathematics professor at Columbia; Beth Y. Karlan ’78, the director of the women's cancer program at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute; Carl F. Muller ’73, a past president of the Harvard Alumni Association; David B. Weinberg ’74, chairman and chief executive officer of the investment company Judd Enterprises; and John Silvanus Wilson, president of Morehouse College.
The University also named nine candidates for the HAA director election.
Overseer candidates may be added to the ballot via petition if they obtain enough signatures from eligible alumni by Feb. 2. Election ballots will be mailed out in April. All alumni, excluding members of the Corporation and “officers of instruction and government,” may vote in the Overseer election, according to the University’s website, while all Harvard degree holders are eligible to vote in the HAA directors election. At HAA's annual meeting in late May, the election results will be announced.
Overseers President and intellectual property lawyer Morgan Chu, Overseers Vice President and cardiologist Walter K. Clair ’77, former New York Times reporter Linda J. Greenhouse ’68, former New York City Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Photeine M. Anagnostopoulos ’81, and wildlife conservationist Cristián Samper will complete their terms in 2015. Greenhouse is a member of The Crimson's graduate board executive committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s hockey team, it’s good to be home.
After a four-game road trip that culminated with a late-game loss to Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., the No. 5/5 Crimson (13-3-2, 10-2-1 ECAC) made a triumphant return to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center with a 4-0 victory over Colgate (5-19-0, 2-10-0). Senior forwards Lydnsey Fry and Kalley Armstrong and senior defender Josephine Pucci each recorded two points as Harvard won its eighth consecutive home game.
“I think that everyone just loves being at our rink,” Pucci said. “It’s a great atmosphere…and everyone’s favorite place to play for sure.”
Two minutes into the second frame, Armstrong put the Crimson on the board with a point-blank finish thanks to an assist from Fry. After controlling the puck on the left side of the crease, Fry squirted a pass through the several Raiders defenseman to find Armstrong unmarked in front of the net.
The Armstrong-Fry connection repeated 11 minutes later, when Fry snapped a shot on target. Armstrong pushed forward, redirected the in-flight puck, and earned her second goal of the night to give the hosts a 2-0 advantage.
Armstrong has exploded in recent play after a quiet start to the season. Over the first three months of competition, the senior didn’t muster a single point; in the month of January alone, she has recorded seven, including three goals.
“[A] big thing is that we have a lot of depth,” Pucci said. “That’s going to help us wear down teams.”
The same narrative has applied to Pucci, who was sidelined by a head injury until the beginning of January. Since her return, the defenseman has accounted for six points, including this recent pair against Colgate.
With less than two minutes left to play, Pucci capped off Harvard’s win with a power-play goal. Junior defenseman Michelle Picard whipped a pass to Pucci at the point, and the senior buried a one-timer in the net.
Pucci had also added an assist fifteen minutes into the second period by finding sophomore forward Sydney Daniels on the counter attack. In turn, Daniels pushed the puck ahead to senior forward Sami Reber, who slid a one-on-one finish past the Raiders’ goalie.
Meanwhile, the Crimson’s back line held strong throughout the evening. Sophomore goalie Brianna Liang made 20 saves en route to her second shutout of the season, adding another win to her spotless 13-0-0 record this season in net.
“The goaltending was key,” Pucci said. “[Brianna] stepped up, and that’s all you can ask from a goaltender.”
The imbalance of the second period reflected the lopsided nature of a game in which the Crimson more than doubled Colgate’s shot output. Harvard finished with 41 attempts while the Raiders recorded 20.
The on-ice disparity reflected an on-paper gap between the two teams. While Harvard is three points out of first place in the ECAC, the Raiders are second-to-last with just four points for their season.
Even in the first period, when Colgate held the hosts scoreless, the Crimson applied significant offensive pressure. However, despite building a 13-8 shot advantage, the hosts could not find the back of the net.
“We started off a bit slow,” Pucci said. “It was a bit sloppy all around in the first period. But as the game went on, our lines started to gel more, and defensively, we tried to do a better job of being a bit crisper.”
The second frame certainly looked crisper, as Harvard produced 11 shots and three goals. The scoring total could have been four, but seven minutes into the period, the Raiders’ goalie smothered a breakaway chance for junior forward Miye D’Oench.
The victory extended the Crimson’s perfect 8-0-0 record at home this season. Harvard has not lost or tied at Bright-Landry since February of 2014, when the home team dropped a double-overtime loss to Yale in game one of the ECAC quarterfinals—the first of a three-game series the Crimson would come back to win.
“It’s such a goal to keep getting better every practice, every game,” Pucci said. “Hopefully we’ll continue to progress as a whole unit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One team threw a punch, the other threw a haymaker.
The finishing blow—a 26-2 second-half run by Dartmouth—left the Harvard men’s basketball team (11-5, 1-1 Ivy) outside the top two teams in the Ivy League for the first time since 2010. After taking a 14-point lead to seize control of the game, the Crimson came away with points on just one of its next 15 offensive possessions.
“I thought they deserved the game, and I told our kids that,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They played tougher, were better coached…than we were, and I think they deserved the victory. It’s disappointing to have to say that, but I think that’s the truth.”
After his team fell behind early, 15-10, Dartmouth coach Paul Cormier changed the complexion of the game by inserting reserve point guard Malik Gill. Two point-guard lineups of Gill and junior Alex Mitola (18 points) outscored the Crimson by 19 points over a span of 14 minutes, with Gill suffocating senior wing Wesley Saunders (six turnovers) during the deciding stretch.
“They are both outstanding ball handlers and penetrators,” Amaker said. “Mitola being an excellent three-point shooter, he can stretch you, and I think Gill was a difference maker in the game. His energy and his defense—he was very scrappy. He didn’t back down from our guys.”
Overall, the Big Green defense took advantage of a turnover-prone Harvard squad. Dartmouth forced 18 turnovers for the game, turning them into 21 points on the offensive end.
The Big Green had 28 points in the paint, turning the Crimson’s size advantage on its head with aggressive ball movement that left Harvard defenders out of position. The Crimson had 24 fouls for the game, and Dartmouth had nearly twice as many points behind the free throw line (22) as behind the three-point one (12).
Harvard appeared to have put the game away with a 15-4 run to open the second half, with Saunders nailing a wide-open trey to give the Crimson a 43-29 lead and bring the crowd to its feet.
But Dartmouth was undeterred. Gill quickly blew past his mark for a layup and found junior forward Tommy Carpenter two possessions later for a layup that cut the lead to 10. The Big Green would then score on five of its next seven possessions, tying the game at 43 on a Gabas Maldunas layup and taking its first lead with 6:39 remaining on a three-point play by Gill.
The layup was doubly damaging for Harvard, with co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi picking up his fifth foul on the play. With the senior (eight points, six rebounds) on the floor, the Crimson outscored Dartmouth by six and shot 48 percent. In the other 22 minutes, it shot 32 percent and was outscored by 15.
With Moundou-Missi gone, Harvard struggled on both ends. The Crimson gave up eight quick points—including two dagger threes by rookie guard Miles Wright—to fall behind by 10, 55-45, with 3:21 to go. Harvard closed to within eight before beginning to foul with 1:38 to go, but it got no closer. Mitola hit ten free throws in the final 90 seconds to ice the game and send the Big Green to its first win over Harvard since 2009.
“You could see how they played the whole game, they definitely wanted to win way more than us,” Saunders said. “We just got to expect every team’s best shot, especially in the Ivy League now, because we’ve been so dominant for the past four years. We just got to be ready for a battle every night.”
One of the few bright spots for the Crimson offensively was the play of senior forward Jonah Travis. Pushed into action due to Harvard’s foul trouble, Travis had nine points and three rebounds in 16 minutes, going a perfect two-of-two from the field and five-of-five from the free throw line.
“I thought Jonah probably played the best of our post players,” Amaker said. “We need a variety of different guys to give us contributions … I thought Jonah gave us good energy and scrapped for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HAMILTON, N.Y. — With the chips down, Kyle Criscuolo turned to the old broken stick trick.
Just over a minute into the third period at Starr Rink, the junior co-captain entered the Colgate zone on the power play, threatening a drop pass to star linemate Jimmy Vesey. Instead, Criscuolo elected to shoot, snapping the shaft of his stick and sending it into the air in the process.
The resulting shot trickled through the pads of a confused sophomore Colgate goaltender Charlie Finn and sparked a 4-0 Harvard run. By the final buzzer, a shorthanded Crimson squad had finished with six unanswered goals and a 6-1 win over the conference preseason favorites.
On a night that the No. 4/4 Harvard men’s hockey team (12-4-2, 8-3-2 ECAC) entered battered and bruised, the Crimson needed a little magic to avert its first three-game losing streak. Criscuolo and company produced that and more, cashing in their largest margin of victory of the season to gain separation on the No. 15/13 Raiders (14-8-2, 6-4-2 ECAC) in the conference standings.
“The resilience of the group was really impressive,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I’m proud of the effort.”
Vesey and Criscuolo starred for the Crimson with two goals and two assists apiece.
Vesey gave Harvard its first lead of the game at 13:35 in the second period with a coast-to-coast effort on a power play. The Charlestown, Mass. native led a rush up the right side, connecting with Criscuolo on a give-and-go at the blueline before getting the puck back in the slot and using speed to beat Finn top-shelf across the crease.
“It was a really nice pass from Criscuolo,” Vesey said. “I think that I had some chances up to that point, so I was getting a little jittery to put one in.”
Crimson junior goaltender Steve Michalek received the secondary assist on the play, which extended Vesey’s NCAA-best point streak to 18 games. Vesey leads all Division I scorers with 0.94 goals per game.
Vesey’s first goal came four minutes after a breakthrough from junior forward Brian Hart on a 4-on-4 opportunity. The second line winger potted his sixth goal of the season—and first non-empty net goal since Nov. 14—after sophomore forward Tyler Moy won a faceoff in the Raider zone and dropped a pass for Hart at the top of the crease.
Criscuolo bookended Harvard’s offensive efforts in the third period, tapping in an empty net goal with less than three and a half minutes left in regulation.
In between, Vesey scored his 17th of the season on a dazzling individual effort in the Colgate zone, skating around multiple Raider defenders in the left faceoff circle before beating Finn glove-side. Eddie Ellis followed less than two minutes later, redirecting an outside shot from defenseman Clay Anderson at 8:13.
The Crimson came out firing in the first period, outshooting the hosts, 14-9. Yet a pair of offensive zone interference penalties slowed Harvard’s momentum in the final five minutes of the frame. Michalek, who finished with 30 stops, bailed the Crimson out with a series of pad saves.
Michalek made just one mistake on the night, when Colgate sophomore forward Tim Harrison put back a slow-sliding rebound from junior defenseman Ryan Johnston at 2:09 in the second period. Harvard responded to the early deficit with what Donato described as a gritty performance.
With sophomore center Luke Esposito and junior defenseman Patrick McNally injured in Friday’s game against Cornell, Donato knew that Saturday’s task would be a difficult one. A last-minute scratch by sophomore defenseman Brayden Jaw did not make things any easier.
The Crimson dressed freshman center Joseph Caffrey and senior winger Mike Seward on the fourth line to fill the gaps. Despite the late notice, the combination impressed, logging important minutes in the Raider zone.
“Mike Seward, [playing in his] first game of the year, I thought he played unbelievable,” Criscuolo said. “He’s a big body and gave [Colgate] a lot of trouble and let our momentum keep going after [his] shift.”
McNally is unlikely to return for the first round of the Beanpot next Monday, while the outlook for Esposito is more positive, according to Assistant Director of Athletic Communications Brock Malone. Sophomore forward Alex Kerfoot might return later this week.
Despite the missing pieces and unanswered questions, Harvard finished an up-and-down January term on an unexpected high.
“I said to the guys after [the game], ‘I’m proud to be along for the ride,’” Donato said. “It was a very gutty, gritty effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no place like home for the Harvard men’s volleyball team (1-2). In its first win of the winter season, the Crimson defeated No. 14 Ball State (4-1) in a sweep at its home opener at the MAC on Friday afternoon.
“It was great to get the first win at home, in our first attempt,” senior middle blocker Caleb Zimmick said. “It was nice to have a crowd on our side cheering us on. It's always easier to play in your home gym too. We are always motivated to win at home and I think this was a very good start.”
This was only the second meeting between the two teams in program history, with Harvard looking to avenge last year’s five set loss and tie up the series against the Cardinals.
“We felt really good coming into the match last night,” Zimmick said. “After a really solid week of practice and strong play last weekend, we were hopeful and confident that we could get our first win of the year. It was great to host a really talented, undefeated team in our first home match and come away with the win.”
The Crimson showed up to the match attack-minded, with sophomore outside hitter Casey White leading the team with a near double-double. He had 12 kills—including a string of three in a row—nine digs, and had a .632 hitting percentage.
White’s older brother, senior outside hitter DJ White contributed seven kills and 12 digs of his own, junior outside hitter Brandon Clemens also had seven kills, and Zimmick rounded out the offense with six kills.
“I think we played amazing as a team,” Clemens said. “Defensively we put a bunch of pressure on their pin hitters and caused many of their starters to be pulled. We simply executed well.”
The offense had a .300 hitting percentage, and outpaced the Cardinals in kills, hitting percentage, digs, and aces. Harvard only had 19 errors (nine service and 10 attack), while Ball State finished with 30 miscues (13 service and 17 attack).
Zimmick led the defense with five blocks, more than half of the eight total blocks the Crimson had. The team held the Cardinals to just a .122 hitting percentage.
“I think that with this win we will be able to take the feeling of executing and playing clean volleyball in all aspects of the game moving forward,” said Clemens. “We know what the feeling is like to play very crisp volleyball which will be essential for the tough conference matches we have ahead of us.”
Harvard started out slow in the first set, trailing Ball State by four points, but went on a 9-4 run to take the lead. From there, the Crimson never looked back, taking the first set 25-19.
The Crimson’s momentum carried over into the second set, where it took an early lead. The Cardinals then took a timeout, hoping to break the momentum. This proved unsuccessful, as Harvard went on a 7-0 run after the break.
Ball State climbed back into the game, cutting the lead to single digits, but the younger White had three kills that cemented Harvard’s 25-14 win in the second set.
By the third set, the teams were trading leads back and forth, and eventually tied at 10 points apiece. After that point, though, the Crimson took control of the game, with kills by DJ White and Clemens propelling the team to a 5-1 scoring run and a 25-17 win to complete the sweep.
“Ball St. beat Penn St. last weekend and so we know that we can play with one of the best teams in our conference and compete for a league title,” Zimmick added. “We also have a better picture of what we have to work on moving forward.”
