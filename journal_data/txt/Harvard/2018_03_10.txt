After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Critics have called her “the grandmother of French New Wave,” but Agnès Varda usually prefers to introduce herself as “a heart-shaped potato.” Last week, the French film director added another title to her long, honorable list: She was announced to be one of the three 2018 Charles Eliot Norton Professors of Poetry. Varda arrived in Cambridge to give two lectures on Feb. 26 and 27, encompassing almost seven decades of work as a photographer, a film director, and a visual artist. Like her art, which has tended to blur traditional barriers between mediums and genres, her lectures seemed somewhat nontraditional.
The lecture on Feb. 27 started when the French song “Sans Toi” (“Without You”), from her film “Cléo from 5 to 7,” filled Sanders Theater. The audience remained silent for a long minute, even after the song ended. Then, the lights went out and Varda finally appeared—but on the screen and out of focus, half-hidden by her cat. “Can you focus on the cat and leave me blurred?” she asked the cinematographer. “It pleases me more.” A few moments later, she went on stage and was greeted with a fervent standing ovation before even starting to speak.
This introduction is not odd for those familiar with Varda’s oeuvre. Haden Guest, director of the Harvard Film Archive and a Senior Lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies, explained that her films often begin with an image of a cat—her version of the famous mascot of the Hollywood film studio MGM. “This is her statement or joke about herself as an independent filmmaker,” Guest said. “Her home is her studio: She has been making her films in her own house from the very beginning of her career, which is remarkable. Her production company, Ciné-Tamaris, is one of the oldest, longest-running independent production companies not just in France but also in the world. She is a real pioneer in this sense.”
For the first time in history, this year’s Norton Lectures feature three filmmakers—American documentarist Frederick Wiseman, who gave two lectures last month, Varda, and German filmmaker Ernst “Wim” Wenders, who will give two lectures in April. Guest, a member of the Norton committee, said that once the decision to focus on filmmakers had been made, the choice of Varda was almost obvious. “We wanted to offer a dynamic, multifaceted vision of cinema as an art that cannot be contained within one point of view,” he explained. “Varda had been someone who we had considered from the very beginning.”
Varda’s first lecture was dedicated to her prolific career as a filmmaker, while the second one was focused on her recent work as a visual artist. “At the end of the lectures I realized that there is still so much more to say, which is just a sign of how important and deep her work is,” Guest said. “The truth is that we would have needed many more lectures to go deeper and think about her, for example, as a pioneer feminist filmmaker.”
The French director declared on stage that she “has always been a feminist,” but that didn’t seem to satisfy the audience. “I wish that we could have gotten more into her feminist practice of film,” Claire P. Flintoff ’19, who attended both lectures, said. “I thought she gave an interesting presentation of her ideas of poetics on film, particularly as someone who started as a young woman filmmaker. It was a great perspective to bring to a wider overview of cinema that was bracketed by two men—Wiseman and Wenders.”
On Sunday, 89-year-old Varda went viral after replacing the traditional red carpet heels and dress with sneakers and kimono at the 90th Academy Awards ceremony. Her most recent film, “Faces Places,” was nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Her lectures in Cambridge made it clear that if Hollywood was a planet, she would be in her own orbit. “I’ve always had a hard time finding money for my films, and the ones I found money for have never brought any money to anyone,” she said in her first lecture.


Indeed, Varda seems to be less interested in the commercial aspect of her creation. “She’s a poetess,” Guest said. “One of the aspects of her work that is rarely spoken about is her skills as a writer.” In this context, Guest mentioned her 1981 film, “Documenteur”—a pun on the French words for “documentary” and “liar”—as an example. “This title is more than just poetry,” he said. “It suggests that when we’re recording our own lives we also have to tell lies to make the narrative work. It’s something that we do whenever we describe ourselves. In any self portrait, there’s an aspect of invention.”

The neon stage lights glared and reflected off of the skin fade haircuts on the general admissions floor at the Paradise Rock Club on Feb. 21. The doors had opened at 7 p.m. to an awaiting throng of fans decked out in the latest streetwear chic. They were all there for the undisputed kings of contemporary Chinese rap music, Higher Brothers (海尔兄弟). Hailing from China, The Higher Brothers roster lists four members: Melo, Psy.P, Masiwei, and DZ Know. The group initially met through the Sichuan based hip-hop collective known as Chengdu Rap House (CDC). Now backed by East Asian music aggregator 88rising, Higher Brothers have turned their attention toward the world, with Boston just one stop on their “Journey to the West” tour. At the Paradise Rock Club, Higher Brothers proved that their version of Chinese rap has the potential to become a commercially and culturally viable form of modern hip-hop.
Higher Brothers brought out several openers to wet the crowd’s palate. First was Matthew Law, a DJ who was there mostly to kill time and keep the crowd hyped up. Although some of his remixes were certifiably “banging,” it looked as if they were played from a pre-made playlist, with very little live-mixing going on: he was playing tracks from his computer but not improvising musically. After about 45 minutes of Law, the crowd welcomed Higher Brothers collaborator and 88rising label-mate Niki to the stage. Niki’s bubblegum trap-pop had a way of transfixing the crowd. Her lighting setup was nearly all pink neon, and her vocal performance had a similar feel. While she may have been unknown to some in the audience, she was certainly a hit.
After Niki’s half hour set, the crowd cheered next for another Higher Brothers collaborator and member of the 88rising family, Bohan Phoenix. Bohan Phoenix brought the energy in a way that Matthew Law and Niki had been unable to as non-rap acts. It became, at long last, a rap concert. During his set, Bohan Phoenix shared his connection to Boston, a city where he had lived for years, and passionately commented on the struggles of moving from China to America through an a capella intro to his song “Overseas 海外.” As Bohan finished his set, there was a distinct aura of anticipation throughout the audience. After 15 minutes of Matthew Law returning to stall, Higher Brothers finally made their entrance.
Higher Brothers took the stage by storm. All four came out to their 2018 release, “Room Service.” The foursome deftly moved about the stage, constantly engaging with fans from all angles. The group was incredibly animated, with DZ Know splashing water onto fans throughout the show. Fans responded well to this provocation, and it was clear that everyone in the room was digging the vibe. Higher Brothers performed pieces both from their debut album, “Black Cab,” as well as their latest EP, “Journey to the West.” They started out each song by a capella rapping the most well-known line, before dropping the beat and going in on the track. This got the audience excited for the upcoming song and ready to rap and sing along with the group. This was particularly effective on their big songs such as “WeChat,” “Made in China,” and “Wudidong (无底洞).” They got audiences singing along to Chinese lyrics, which is a feat in and of itself in the U.S., but especially impressive given Higher Brothers’ level of lyrical complexity. Perhaps more impressive is the fact that Higher Brothers sold out the Paradise Rock Club, proving to themselves and any doubters that their brand of Chinese trap music is commercially feasible.
After rounding off ending their set with “WeChat,” Higher Brothers left the stage to thunderous applause from the crowd. After several rousing chants from the masses for an encore, Bohan Phoenix took to the stage with Higher Brothers in an epic collaborative finale of Bohan’s song “No Hook” featuring Higher Brothers. It was here that Higher Brothers cemented themselves as true performers and artists. With their encore performance, they elicited a response from the crowd comparable to any mainstream US rapper. It is abundantly clear that Higher Brothers’ unique form of Chinese trap music is both culturally relevant and powerful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rap landscape can feel somber in the wake of the past year, when artists like Lil Peep and Fredo Santana died of overdoses. Many of the genre’s biggest names of the last year, like Lil Peep, Lil Tracy, Lil Uzi Vert, and Trippie Redd, specialized in emo rap and have made their fame from singing about their struggles with mental health and drug abuse. Amid the challenges of the past year, Lil Xan's concert at the Middle East on Mar. 2 was an inspiring showcase of exuberance and resilience.
Lil Xan debuted his music career through digital outlets like SoundCloud and YouTube. He first garnered attention for his single, “Betrayed,” which reached number 64 on the “Billboard” Hot 100 chart last year. His career is still young, and his first tour proves that he’s capable of a music presence that is more than just an internet sensation.
$teven Cannon opened the show attempting to “hype up” the crowd, splashing the audience with water and flirting with various audience members. Though he approached the show with gusto, save for the select group of fans devoted enough to know his name, most of the audience was unresponsive.
Lil Xan’s show, on the other hand, was shockingly energetic. From the moment he spontaneously burst onstage to “Been Bout it,” to the end of the show, Xan was charismatically bouncing around the stage and practically shouting his lyrics. The crowd and Xan played off of each other well, with the former moshing to nearly every song and the latter rewarding them with Skittles. Xan’s “Tick Tock,” an unreleased single, helped bring life to Middle East. The title piece of the tour, “Xanarchy,” proved iconic, interspersed with Xan’s ad libs.
Lil Xan transitioned to a more mellow tone towards the end of the show, playing a cover of the late Lil Peep’s “BeamerBoy.” Xan’s skill and emotion constituted a positive memorialization of Lil Peep, who passed away after overdosing on Xanax last November. Even though context surrounding his performance of “beamer boy” was depressing, Lil Xan turned it into a motivational experience, jumping around on stage and gesturing to the audience to rap along with him. Since Lil Peep’s death, Lil Xan and many other artists have been vocally campaigning against Xanax addiction.
This message and these lyrics concluded Lil Xan’s concert as he rapped his most popular hit of the album, “Betrayed.” Squeals of excitement from the audience followed the familiar first rings of the song. With enunciated syllables and broad body movements, Lil Xan gave the audience a moving and passionate rendition of the song: “Xans don’t make you / Xans gon’ take you / Xans gon’ fake you / Xans gon’ betray you,” resounding deeply after the tribute to Lil Peep.
In the context of Peep’s death and “Betrayed” as the finale, Lil Xan’s show advocated for overcoming adversity, in this case of drug abuse, but the concert felt larger than that. The contrast of Xan’s bright energy and glee live with the sad, murky sound on his recordings gave his songs new context. They felt empowering instead of depressing. The central message of Lil Xan’s show in the face of all this was that the audience could overcome any of their struggles. In a time of terrifying uncertainty, this was extremely powerful.
Lil Xan’s concert was a reminder that emo rap isn’t always sad. In his hour on stage, Lil Xan seemed confident and exuberant. His audience responded to that well, moshing and clearly having a great time overall. If Lil Xan could bring a crowd together like that, then there’s no telling what he’ll be able to do in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite last year’s failed attempt, the Trump administration is again planning to significantly slash the National Endowment for the Arts’ budget. If their budget proposal goes through, the NEA’s budget will be cut from $150 million to $29 million by 2019. Yet, some Massachusetts arts organizations are fighting back against the proposed cut through a petition started by MASSCreative, a Boston-based arts advocacy group.
Titled “Stop Trump’s Attack on the Arts and Humanities,” the petition is addressed to the Massachusetts Congressional Delegation, and has received over 1,600 signatures as of Mar. 4. It seeks to maintain the NEA’s budget for the fiscal year of 2018 and to raise it to $155 million in 2019. Matthew L. Wilson, the executive director of MASSCreative, says that the petition was conceived out of a necessity to safeguard arts funding.
“We think it’s important that the arts and creativity are funded and supported by our government, both on a state and national level,” Wilson says. “The latest proposal by President Trump proposes to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, and would in essence stop the funding of critical arts and cultural projects throughout the country.”
“We’re looking for the congressional representatives of Massachusetts to be leaders in the fight to maintain the NEA,” Wilson says. The petitions calls on the government’s responsibility to maintain the NEA’s budget. Local arts and culture groups have responded to MASSCreative’s call as well.
“I think that this is important for society at large,” Jennifer R. Hughes, executive director of the music group Cantata Singers, says. “Government money is vital for small and mid-sized organizations. We really depend on this money to provide general operating work, and for carrying on projects that we wouldn’t be able to do on our own.”
“The arts are a vital part of American democracy, and deserve public support,” Greg P. Liakos, the communications director of Mass Cultural Council, a state agency for the arts, says. According to Liakos, the Mass Cultural Council is a state partner of the NEA. He says that there are several key parts in thinking about the benefits of the arts, one of which is economic growth.
“The arts are central to job creation, economic growth, and separately, the arts are vital to ensuring a creative and entrepreneurial workforce,” Liakos says. On Mar. 6, the NEA and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released data that revealed that arts and cultural production contributed to 4.2 percent of the nation’s GDP, adding “four times more to the U.S. economy than the agricultural sector and $200 billion more than transportation or warehousing.” “Both the arts opportunities our residents have and the quality of life the arts provide as a result track and retain a quality workforce,” Liakos says.
Another reason to protest the slashing, according to Liakos, is that public arts funding is necessary for keeping the arts available for everyone of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
“It ensures that everyone, regardless of their background, their income level, or their geography can participate in the arts and culture,” Liakos says. “If we rely solely on private funding, there’s a chance that a lot of individuals from underrepresented communities, or in rural communities, and/or poor neighborhoods—urban and suburban communities—wouldn’t have access to music, to theater, to visual arts. Culture should be available and accessible to everyone.”
Both Liakos and Hughes mention that arts funding is critical, adding to a larger, national conversation that Trump’s budget proposal has prompted. But Wilson also wants to remind people that smaller, local governments are responsible for both keeping leaders accountable and providing adequate financial support for the arts.
“Over the past three years we’ve had to fight here in Massachusetts to keep the budget at where it is—at 14 million dollars,” Wilson says. “It’s really time for Massachusetts to step up and increase their investment to the arts.”
The work is necessary, according to Liakos.
“Arts and culture have always been a vital part of American democracy,” Liakos says. “The government has a small but important role to play in fostering a rich and diverse cultural life for American citizens and visitors.”

UPDATED: March 16, 2018 at 7:10 p.m.
In the summer of 2017, James Lim ’16 found himself boarding a plane to Fiji with 20 strangers, getting ready for the hardest six weeks of his life.
Lim, a former Economics concentrator and Eliot house resident, is part of the cast of the 36th season of “Survivor."
But despite his excitement for the show, Lim says he never expected the opportunity. “It was this perfect storm of coincidences happening. I kicked it off by applying to the Amazing Race over J-term my senior year,” Lim says. “I got cut quite late in the [casting] process because they had quote-unquote bigger personalities for the season.”
Then, 10 months later, Lim got a call from the CBS casting director. She saw his Amazing Race application and said he should apply to Survivor. “The casting process involved a three-minute application video, background checks, phone interviews, written bios, and a weeklong finalist camp in L.A.,” Lim says. “Around April 2017, I got a call saying, ‘Pack your bags, you’re going to Fiji.’”
Though Lim says CBS taught the cast members some survival basics—what was edible on the island, how to set up crab traps, and how to make fire—most of his preparation took place before he even packed his bags. “I watched tons of seasons going back to help prepare,” Lim says. “I worked out like crazy, practiced starving, practiced bulking up.”

Yet Lim knew that he wasn’t going to be completely ready. “I spoke to a couple of former players to really know that it is truly a life-changing experience,” Lim says. “No one can really explain how hard it is going to be. The exhaustion, the starvation, the lack of sleep, the paranoia—those elements pushed my body to places it’s never been before. I knew it was going to suck, it was going to hurt, but I knew it was going to be worth it.”
Though he came in with a mindset to win, Lim also had other things on his mind. “Every season of Survivor, on average, has one Asian—the token Asian—and I knew immediately the moment that I saw the cast at the resort that I was that one Asian of the season,” Lim says. “So did I feel the burden of representation? Yes. But I don’t think it harmed me in any way.” Lim explains that he wrote in his bio for the show that he felt most similar to Yul Kwon, the first-ever Asian-American winner of Survivor. “He did a good job breaking stereotypes of Asians,” Lim says of Kwon. “I also wanted to show that Asian Americans can be athletic, can make bold moves.”
By the end of his time in Fiji, Lim says he was surprised by how close he grew to the other participants. “Flying out there, I had in mind that this is a reality show. The people on it are kind of crazy, we’re all kind of crazy, and that’s why we’re there, playing this crazy game,” Lim says. “But, I actually met quite a surprising number of solid, genuine people that I really bonded with. Now, after the game, I stay in daily touch with at least half of them. And I can truly say that there’s not a single one of them that is a person I’m not fond of.”
Though Lim claims that nothing from his academic career at Harvard directly helped him on Survivor, he adds there were a couple comparable situations. “One would be going through the thesis process where I just lived in Lamont for a whole week before the due date, and sometimes I just took quick power naps in a chair and went back to work,” he says. “By the end of the week, I was as exhausted as I’ve ever been.”
Lim says his time on is different from any other experience he has ever had. “We played Survivor, and we survived Survivor, and that just taught us that there are no obstacles we can’t overcome. This sounds cheesy, but it’s really true from our perspective. Nothing in the real world will match how hard that was, because we all brought back this amazing perspective of how great our limits are and what we actually can achieve,” Lim says.

Behind the scenes, there are no Power Bars, no soft mattresses to sleep on, and no shuttle rides to the Quad. Lim’s waist shrunk so much that he recommends all future male castaways “wear boxer briefs and not plain boxers.” After a tough six weeks, Lim is quick to point out that in order to survive, you must “always be thinking of the game, never ever let your guard down. The minute you become complacent, you’re going to be voted off.”
Survivor is still an experience Lim wishes he could do all over again. “Every single one of us, ever since we came back, has been dreaming of going back. You kind of get addicted to the experience,” Lim says. “You get home and you immediately want to play again, no matter how hard it was.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 16, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that James Lim is the second Harvard-affiliated castaway in the history of the show "Survivor." In fact, he is one of several Harvard-affiliated castaways in the show's history.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Government department will hire a visiting scholar in Latin American studies and will create an electronic “suggestion box" in an attempt to address the fallout from recent sexual harassment allegations made against Professor Jorge I. Dominguez.  
Department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild emailed Government Ph.D. and undergraduate students Friday morning to detail initiatives the department will undertake in coming weeks to create a “safe, healthy, and intellectually exciting environment.” Hochschild also thanked students for previous open letters they sent the department and wrote that faculty are “committed” to working with students to address any issues of culture and climate within the department.
The open letters and Hochschild’s response follow two articles published in The Chronicle of Higher Education that reported 18 women are accusing Dominguez of sexual harassment over a 30-year period. Dominguez is currently on paid administrative leave while the University conducts a “full and fair review” of the allegations against him. Dominguez—on sabbatical this semester—announced Tuesday he will retire from his teaching duties at the end of the semester and that he is immediately stepping down from all his administrative duties.
Hochschild wrote in her Friday letter that, in the wake of Dominguez's departure, the department received funding for a visiting professor in Latin American studies—Dominguez’s field of study—for the 2018-2019 academic year. The new fellow will be tasked with teaching and advising graduate and undergraduate students.
The department is also creating an electronic suggestion box to which Harvard affiliates will be able to anonymously submit questions and information, according to Hochschild's letter. Hochschild wrote she will choose a faculty member to monitor the submissions and publicize the suggestion box’s existence.
In an open letter to department faculty and administrators sent Wednesday, undergraduates previously demanded the Government department work to increase the number of Latinx and Latin American Studies professors in the department.
“Jorge Dominguez was one of three Latin Americanists in the Government department, and of a very small number of Latinx professors at Harvard,” the letter read. “As Dominguez leaves the department, he must be replaced as soon as possible with at least one Latinx Latin Americanist.”
The undergraduates' letter also called for the department to offer more gender-focused government courses.
Hochschild wrote in her letter that the department will offer an undergraduate lecture course called “Feminist Political Thought” next semester and that the department is “exploring the possibility of” offering other courses on gender and politics.
Hochschild’s letter also gave further information on the standing committee that the department established Tuesday to investigate department climate. Dubbed the “Climate Change Committee,” the group will be chaired by Hochschild and professor Steven R. Levitsky. Other members include professors Danielle S. Allen, Melani C. Cammett, Ryan D. Enos, Katrina Forrester, and Jeffry A. Frieden.
Director of Graduate Studies Dustin Tingley and Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch will also serve on the committee. The Government department is still searching for student and staff participants, as well as a research assistant, per Hochschild's email.
The email to students also contained a copy of a “Statement of Principles” posted on the Government department’s website Friday morning. The principles broadly outline the department’s plans to address ongoing issues in the wake of the Dominguez scandal and reaffirms the department’s “zero tolerance” policy towards sexual harassment.
“The Department has let our students and colleagues down by not recognizing a pattern of problems, and for not establishing institutions and a culture that would empower victims,” the statement reads. “We will seek individually and collectively to address concerns about inappropriate power dynamics, gendered interactions, disruptive fear or anxiety, and other constraints on genuine discourse and free exchange of ideas.”

Staff data analysts Dianne Lee and Gerardo Parra analyzed and formatted the data for this report. Staff writer Isabel M. Kendall wrote the accompanying article; and staff writer Michael E. Xie contributed to the reporting of the article.
A Crimson analysis of data provided by the Harvard University Police Department on 581 reported crimes in 2017 reveals crime on campus is generally concentrated in areas closer to the Charles River and Harvard Square.
The data provided to The Crimson form a subset of total crimes listed in HUPD police logs in 2017. The department chose not to include certain types of crimes in the data it provided, including crimes it deemed less severe—like trespass warnings—or confidential.
HUPD will release all of its crime data later this year in the department’s annual security report. But for now, the data provided to The Crimson offers insight into broad trends both in the type and location of crime on Harvard’s campus.
The type of crime most commonly occurring in the dataset was theft, with 394 unique incidents in 2017. The second most common type of crime in the dataset was vandalism, with 86 unique incidents.
Threats, harassment, and assaults were all next-most common, with 27, 25, and 23 unique incidents, respectively.
The majority of reported crimes took place on the most densely populated areas of Harvard’s campus: in locales by the river Houses (Eliot, Kirkland, Winthrop, Dunster, Leverett, and Mather), in Harvard Yard, and in areas nearby the Yard. A small percentage of reported incidents occurred in the greater Boston and Cambridge areas. Another small cluster took place on the Longwood Medical campus, which houses Harvard Medical School, Harvard Dental School, and the School of Public Health.
Peabody Terrace—a housing complex owned by the University, which primarily houses graduate students—saw the highest number of reported crimes of any single location on campus, according to The Crimson's analysis. Steven G. Catalano, HUPD’s Public Information Officer, said the high number came from “a spike in thefts at Peabody Terrace related to package thefts.”
The below map—compiled by Crimson data analysts—displays 578 of the reported crimes HUPD provided, categorized by type and located on the map according to where they reportedly took place. Three incidents of rape are not shown, given they were reported as occurring in a “river house.” The specific Houses where these incidents occurred were not named in the report.
 *There were actually 6 cases of rape logged in the data provided; 3 locations were confidential and couldn't be mapped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s tennis returns to the courts for the first time in two weeks this Saturday at the Murr Center. The team hopes the break has served it well, as it faces a back-to-back Saturday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.
“For us it's been a more of a healing process and not so much of a rest process,” coach Traci Green said. “It’s been a couple weeks off and those who have been healthy have been working hard on staying sharp. Those that have been [injured] are getting healthy.”
At 11 a.m. the team takes on the Marist Red Foxes (4-4, 2-0 Metro Atlantic Athletic), who had had their hot streak cooled last weekend at Army. Despite losing three straight matches to start the season, the team rallied off four straight wins before falling to the Black Knights on March 3rd.
Both teams see this as a pivotal matchup they hope to take advantage to get back into the winning column, and, more importantly, show improvement.
“Our whole focus this season is improving every match,” Green said. “Even though we haven't quite shown [wins] in every match we know that we are improving.”
The Crimson comes into this game following a pair of tough losses two weeks ago against formidable opponents Syracuse and Boston College. Marist will likely match this fire coming off a 7-0 sweep in their last action. Harvard, however, will not change its approach for Saturday’s showdowns.
“Our player approach every match the same way,” said Green. “It doesn’t matter who’s across the net… they’ll be fired up and ready to get back in action.”
This will not by an easy match for either team, as both feature individual players that have playing very well over the past few weeks. Red Fox freshman Julia Gabay is coming off a hot February, winning her first MAAC player of the week award in her young career. Strong performances carried her to a 4-0 weekend against Lafayette College and Bucknell University.
On the Harvard side, junior Erica Oosterhout is coming off a pair of strong performances in her last two matches. On Feb. 24, she completed a gritty comeback to win her singles match 2-6, 6-3, 6-1. The following day she offered a tight match to the Number 18 ranked player despite losing 6-7, 1-6.
The team hopes another strong effort from Oosterhout and the rest of the team will bring them their first match victory in almost a month.
At 3 p.m. the Crimson takes on the Providence College Friars at the Murr Center (3-7, 0-1 Big East). Again, this will be another matchup about creating new win streaks for both teams coming into conference tournaments next month.
“We’re using this weekend’s matches for mental prep,” Green said. “And to fine tune our games for our spring trip.”
The Friars are coming off a tough string of matches losing their last four. These losses included a loss at home versus conference rival Butler.  The last matches specifically have taken an unfortunate turn as Providence has been swept 7-0 in each.
Youth will be a common quality in this matchup. The Friars come in as an extremely young team, with six of their eight players coming in as a sophomore or younger.  Harvard is not any more experienced itself, with eight of eleven of its rostered players being freshmen or sophomores.
Oosterhout’s doubles partner, sophomore Natasha Gonzalez, will look to continue her strong play with this Saturday as well. Gonzalez comes off a singles victory in her last match, winning 6-4, 7-6. The pair hopes up to team up and contribute to doubles victories on Saturday as well.
The team looks to see great play in this weekend and take the success into a string of Ivy league games before the league tournament. The common sentiment is that Ivy league play will be competitive.
“Right now, it’s all about building toward the Ivies,” Gonzalez said.
Moving forward, the team feels very confident in its play. With wins this weekend the team could build some much needed momentum going into next month’s matchups.
“We know at that point we’ll be a top contender for the Ivy title” Green said.

PHILADELPHIA—The Harvard men’s basketball stormed back from an early deficit to defeat Cornell on Saturday afternoon in the semifinals of the Ivy League Tournament. The win gives Harvard an opportunity to clinch the conference’s NCAA Tournament berth on Sunday. The Crimson (18-12, 12-2 Ivy) knocked off the Big Red 74-55 after a rejuvenated final three minutes in the first frame and a dominant second half.
In the latter frame, Harvard outscored Cornell by 14 points, capping off a game in which the Crimson shot over 44 percent from both the field and three-point range.
Sophomore forward Seth Towns, who Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said did not perform to his full potential on Saturday, tallied a team-high 24 points and 12 rebounds. Classmate Chris Lewis also notched a double-double, his fifth of the season.
“Tournaments and atmospheres can cause you to have a lot of energy, and wasted energy,” Amaker said. “We were concerned that we felt like we were gassed early and I thought some of that comes with the environment, the excitement…I think we settled in. I hate it, but it’s a fact of the game that you need to make a few shots before you can relax a little bit.”
Although Lewis was able to open the contest in resounding fashion with a slam dunk off of a drive-in from sophomore wing Justin Bassey,  the Crimson played sluggishly for much of the first half. Lewis did not score his second basket until the 10-minute mark of the first frame, at which point Harvard trailed, 18-14.

Three early turnovers halted much of the offensive stability, animating Amaker when he called a timeout in the opening five minutes. After converting 17 triples against Columbia heading into this weekend, the Crimson hit just one trey in the first 10 minutes.
By the 4:58 mark of the opening frame, Harvard had fallen behind by seven points to the fourth-seeded Big Red. Cornell’s backcourt, led by junior guard Matt Morgan, took advantage of the Crimson defense on numerous possessions, finishing easy back-door layups. The Big Red also converted four triples in those 15 minutes.
From there, though, a sleeping Harvard offense re-awakened, capped off by an unlikely half-court buzzer beater to conclude the half. The last-second heave by sophomore point guard Christian Juzang was his third consecutive made triple to close out the frame. Alongside a three from freshman guard Rio Haskett at the 2:45 mark, late first half baskets propelled the Crimson to a five-point lead entering intermission.
“Coach always talks about the momentum going into the half and how big that can be going into the second half,” Juzang said. “We stuck with our other principles pretty well. Obviously, our shots weren’t falling for the first half, but we stuck in defensively as best we could. Lewis and the bigs cleaning up the rebounds, Seth getting to the free throw line, little things like that.”
In the last three minutes of the first frame, Harvard had converted a 28-21 deficit to a 37-32 lead. That hot streak continued through the referee’s whistle to start the second half. After having difficulty generating space against Cornell forward Stone Gettings in the first 20 minutes and getting trapped on double-teams, Lewis made some important adjustments at halftime.
In the team’s opening possession, the Harvard sophomore forcefully attacked the paint but saw his lay-up attempt rattle off the rim. Unflinched, Lewis regained the ball but missed again. It would take a resounding third attempt before Lewis successfully maneuvered his way to an open finish. Despite the initial fruitless attempts, the energy and hustle of Lewis on the glass proved to be a positive harbinger for the rest of the half.
“When he’s productive people have to collapse on him and it opens it up for everybody else,” Amaker said. “He’s the key for our team and our program and it allows all the other pieces to hopefully flow and fit. As we settled in you can see the balance that he causes for our team.”
Lewis tripled his disappointing first half point tally in the second frame, finishing with 16 total points on the contest. His initial bucket was answered by another backdoor layup from freshman guard Terrance McBride and a Morgan triple, but that two-point margin was as close as the Big Red would get towards eclipsing the Crimson.
Subsequently, Haskett tallied his second triple of the game, followed by another from freshman forward Danilo Djuricic at the 14:19 point. The 52-41 Harvard lead was its largest at that point, and that margin would continue to balloon. Two threes by Towns and continued success going in low to Lewis brought the lead to 18 entering the final eight minutes.
“That’s one of my roles on the team, to stay composed, be prepared for the moment,” Towns said. “Obviously, my teammates have confidence in me to make plays toward the end of games and critical moments that’s what I try to do.”
By then, Amaker had slowed the pace of the game and the team locked in on defense to seal the contest. Two straight turnovers heading into the eight-minute media timeout from Cornell epitomized how the Big Red confidence that had defined the early parts of the game had been sucked out of the Palestra.
With the Crimson holding onto a 19-point lead at the 4:16 mark, Amaker subbed out Towns and sophomore forward Justin Bassey before putting in his seniors to conclude the final two minutes of play.
With the victory, Harvard is set as the higher seeded team in tomorrow’s championship final, to be played on ESPN2 Sunday at noon. Only Penn stands in the way of the Crimson earning its first tournament berth since the 2014-2015 season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Historically, the Harvard men’s hockey team has been a force to reckon with in its home rink, Bright-Landry Hockey Center. The Crimson hadn’t lost a game to ECAC playoff opponent Dartmouth at home since Nov. 26, 2010. Nevertheless, after the two teams battled it out in their quarterfinal series opener on Friday night, one squad came away with a win—and it wasn’t the hosts.
Despite several surges of momentum, Harvard (13-13-4, 11-8-3 ECAC) was simply unable to find a solid offensive footing as the Big Green (16-5-2, 11-10-1) played unflinching defense, anchored by senior net-minder Devin Buffalo. The Crimson’s own defensive errors proved too costly, as Dartmouth jumped out to an early lead that it never relinquished, and the visitors nabbed a 4-1 victory in Game 1 of the series.
“I thought the team that won more battles and was a little more desperate won the game,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato '91. “They looked a little more invested in the hard areas of the ice…. We have to take a look in the mirror and say, ‘Hey, what kind of effort is it going to take for us to have success?’”
The Crimson and the Big Green are the fourth and fifth seeds in the ECAC tournament, and that small difference gave the former a bye week while the latter took down St. Lawrence in three games in the tournament’s opening round.
For Harvard, the week off seems to have been both a blessing and a curse: junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage returned to the ice after sitting out the regular season finale against Yale for maintenance issues, but rookie forward Henry Bowlby did not dress against Dartmouth. When asked about Bowlby’s condition, coach Donato declined to comment.
“I don’t want to take anything away from the reality that they were more competitive than we were,” said coach Donato when asked if the rest week had adversely affected his team.
The Big Green carried a 2-0 lead into the second, but until halfway into that middle frame, the game seemed very much within reach for the Crimson. After a slow start, the Harvard icemen had found their legs and were putting pressure on Dartmouth’s defense.
But in a burst of offensive-zone time, Big Green junior forward Alex Jasiek found his rookie linemate Matt Baker in the slot. Baker made no mistake, ripping a shot past Crimson tri-captain goaltender Merrick Madsen and widening the gap between the teams to 3-0.
“Baker’s [was] probably [the biggest goal],” said Dartmouth head coach Bob Gaudet. “To put us up three, [it] was a really big goal for us. It was a really strong play, he jumped on the puck and buried it.”
It was only much later in the game, as time ticked down in the third period, that Harvard was able to find the net. Madsen had left the ice for an extra skater with more than four minutes to play, making the Crimson’s comeback intentions clear. A left-circle shot from junior forward Ryan Donato skipped through the blue paint, forcing Buffalo to stretch out.
For the first time all night, Buffalo could not track the puck as it found sophomore forward Nathan Krusko at the other circle. With the goalie down, Krusko easily slotted it past him, bringing the score to 3-1. Krusko’s tally broke Buffalo’s 57-minute shutout—had the Big Green held Harvard off for the entire game, it would have been the team’s first shutout win against the Crimson since Feb. 9, 2001.
After the faceoff at center ice, Harvard pulled Madsen again, but the same trick would not work twice. Dartmouth alternate captain Corey Kalk put the game away with an empty-netter.
“We came on, I thought, as the game went on,” coach Donato said. “But to me, that’s neither here nor there as far as the outcome of the game [is concerned].”
The teams traded penalties throughout the game, but neither could capitalize. For the Big Green, a team that’s sitting on a 12.1 percent power play efficiency and has come to rely on even-strength scoring instead, that was perhaps less of an issue.
The Crimson has had bursts of power play success and failure, but in recent weeks has upped its season-long conversion rate to 19.3 percent. Despite extended offensive zone time and a 5-on-3 thanks to Dartmouth's back-to-back too- many-men penalties, Harvard was unable to find twine.
“More than anything, I thought that they won loose pucks,” coach Donato said. “When they got a chance to get it down [the ice], they did. We didn’t have a lot of second and third effort [chances] in our game…. We looked like we just wanted to play and not compete.”
Madsen, who started his 13th postseason game in net for the Crimson, began the game with an acrobatic series of saves but a hard angle shot from sophomore Cam Strong squeaked by him to give the Big Green the lead. Though his numbers (3.22 GAA, .850 SV%) might suggest otherwise, Madsen did not look shaky on Friday night, aside from that first goal.
At the other end of the ice, Buffalo was in control, helped in part by his team’s shot-blocking—while the goalie turned away 34 of Harvard’s 35 shots, Dartmouth also blocked 27 of the Crimson’s attempts. For Harvard, which has often been frustrated by defense despite its shot volume this season, this is a story the team will not want to repeat any more.
For the first time since last season’s ECAC semifinals, the Crimson faces a must-win game if it wants to push ahead in the tournament. With the season on the line, Harvard will have to leave it all on the ice on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since last season's ECAC semifinals, the Harvard men's hockey team is staring at a must-win matchup.
Having lost Game 1 of the best-of-three series to Dartmouth (16-15-2, 11-10-1 ECAC) on Friday, the Crimson's (13-13-4, 11-8-3) season is on the line as the teams return to Bright-Landry for Game 2. The hosts will need to look for an offensive jump after Friday's disappointing 4-1 result.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With seven minutes left in the third period between the Harvard men’s hockey team and Dartmouth, junior forward Ryan Donato threaded a stretch pass to his sophomore linemate Ty Pelton-Byce. The sophomore had snuck behind the Big Green defense; picking up the pass, he switched to his backhand and found the back of the net.
On any other night, that goal would have been far more impressive. But the tally was the last of the Crimson’s whopping seven goals in the game. After dropping Game 1 of the ECAC quarterfinals to Dartmouth the day before, 4-1, Harvard needed to come out strong to save its season. That’s exactly what the Crimson (14-13-4, 11-8-3 ECAC) did, handing the Big Green (16-16-2, 11-10-1) a 7-1 drubbing.
“We were a lot more determined,” said Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91. “Our sense of urgency was...much more playoff-like than last night.”

The driving force behind the win was the middle frame’s four Harvard goals. Having already jumped out to a 2-0 lead, the Crimson didn’t stop there. Sophomore forward Nathan Krusko tossed the puck at the pads of Dartmouth senior net-minder Devin Buffalo. While Pelton-Byce and Donato kept Buffalo preoccupied, Krusko found his own rebound and chipped it over the goaltender. The tally was Krusko’s second of the series—he scored Harvard’s lone goal in Game 1.
Soon after, sophomore defenseman Adam Fox joined the party. Twice, Fox found himself with the puck in the slot. Both times, he picked the top-right corner, first with a turnaround shot and then with a wrister. Even though the Big Green tallied in between Fox’s goals, the Crimson did not lose stride, holding onto its 5-1 lead.


“I’m a pass guy first, not a shot mentality [player],” Fox said. “But when the opportunity’s there, I try and take advantage of it...and try and help my team as best as I can.”
The teams traded penalties through the game, and Dartmouth sophomore Will Graber received a five-minute major and a game misconduct for cross-checking Donato in the head. Donato didn’t seem the worse for wear though, netting a goal on a different man-advantage opportunity to close out the second period.
Earlier, he’d had a goal taken away after the referees judged that Pelton-Byce had interfered with Buffalo during the play. Needless to say, the Olympian was glad to have the tally back to push his team ahead, 6-1.
“At the end of the day, if I’m helping the team...I’m happy,” the younger Donato said. “At this time of the year, it doesn’t really matter who’s putting the goal in or who’s got the assist. There’s only so many games left in the season, and if we can continue to win, I think that’s what’s important.”
The Big Green switched goalies after the second period, sending out sophomore Adrian Clark for his first postseason start. As sharp as Buffalo had looked the night before, Harvard had its revenge, and the senior left the ice having stopped 23 of 29 shots. Meanwhile, between the pipes for the Crimson, tri-captain Merrick Madsen had a bounceback game after his rough start on Friday, turning away all but one of Dartmouth’s 22 shots (.955 SV%).
“[Madsen’s performance] couldn’t have come at a better time,” coach Donato said. “I thought Merrick was solid.”
Special teams came through for the home team, as Harvard finished the night having converted on 2 of 4 power play opportunities and killed off all its five penalties. The Crimson broke the ice on its first man-advantage chance of the game, with junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage finding twine from the right circle. Less than 30 seconds later, rookie forward Ben Solin added to the scoreboard, shoveling the puck in past a scramble in the blue paint.
Overall, 12 different players notched at least a point on the night. Fox (2–2—4) and Donato (1–3—4) paced the team, and Krusko, Pelton-Byce, and sophomore defenseman John Marino all had two-point games too. The Harvard icemen can leave the rink tonight with the confidence that they played like their season was on the line.

“Our whole group last night, in almost every facet, didn’t operate at a high enough rate for us to have success,” coach Donato said. “We addressed some things today, and I know our captains...had the group in the proper mindset for us to come out and play well tonight.”
With a deciding Game 3 set for Sunday at 5 p.m., the Crimson must summon up a similar offensive explosion to keep its ECAC title defense alive. The last time Harvard entered the ECAC playoffs as the fourth seed was in 2006—after losing its first quarterfinal game, the Crimson came back to take the Whitelaw Cup. The hosts will certainly be hoping that history repeats itself come Sunday.

Don’t even bother trying to hide the fact that you procrastinated the hell out of last week by watching Housing Day videos. We did too. For those of you out there who have self control and stopped after a few, we ranked all the vids for you, so you have an excuse to fall back down that rabbit hole.
Eliot - ‘BODAK ELIOT’4.6 stars
This year, Eliot takes the cake in creating what may have been the most hype video of the year. With great costumes, great lyrics, and fun and creative cinematography, Eliot achieves both hype and humor. Everyone knows they’re rolling in dough, and we appreciate them leaning into it.
Dunster - ‘Holding Out for Dunster’4.5 stars
Dunster continues its trend of high quality videos complete with great vocals and amazing effects. What the video lacks in humor, they kind of make up for in cute children and the image of a moose riding nobly on a horse.
Mather- ‘Mathier Parti’4.3 stars
In a surprising turn of events, Mather gets a high rating. This was the second Cardi B song of the year, but are we mad? No. Points for consistent firing of shots and for making us forget how prison-like Mather is with all the singles braggin. Bonus points for not bleeping any of the swear words. Ballsy.
Pforzheimer - ‘Pforzheimer Things’4 stars
Pfoho came through with INCREDIBLE CINEMATOGRAPHY. The only reason this isn’t at the top is because, well, Cardi. And horses. Sorry, that’s just how the world works. But we are very impressed.
Cabot - ‘Party in The Quad All Day’4 stars
Cabot’s wholesome video made us feel warm inside. Maybe getting quadded isn’t so bad, with a community like Cabot’s.
Leverett - ‘BunnyBack’3.8 stars
With a cool drone shot, pizza rolls, and a corgi, Lev has all the elements a successful video needs. It’s not the best video ever made, but it has those three elements, so we’d say Leverett has earned their stars.
Winthrop - ‘Throp’s Plan’3.7 stars
For a video made with a “$150 minus $150” budget, this video featured a lion with some pretty solid dance moves. Though the overall video wasn’t too bad, Winthrop knew that they did not need to work too hard in the hype department to get freshmen stoked, and it shows.
Currier - ‘Woody Gang’3.5 stars
We thought we had left "Gucci Gang" in 2017, but Currier redeems itself by featuring dogs and a cool duck. Extra points for cringe.
Quincy - ‘Quincy Air’3 stars
As Flyby, I guess we should give Quincy some credit for trying to have a flying theme. Though the attempts at humor via flirty comments weren’t the worst things we’ve ever been subjected to, the video was much too long for any person to be expected to suffer through.
Lowell - ‘Lowtel Room Service’2.5 stars
After “Get Lowell” from 2013, Lowell has always had a lot to live up to. We were invested at the beginning of the video, but unfortunately as it went on it got more and more mediocre and repetitive until we just couldn’t do it anymore.
Kirkland - ‘Kirkland’2.3 stars
Presented as a slideshow presentation, Kirkland really outdoes itself this year with its low audio quality and terrifically horrifying choice of “Friday” by Rebecca Black. However, since Kirkland wanted to live up to this...we decided to be generous.
Adams - ‘Adams Housing Day Video 2018’1.5 stars
We knew the only good thing about Adams was proximity, and we’d like to thank them for the confirmation.
So there you have it: Flyby’s definitive ranking of the Housing Day videos! Now that you’ve been housed, we suggest rewatching them so that you can relish in the magnificence of your own House while cackling at how lame and ridiculous the other Houses are.
Sections
We ranked the mascots. We ranked the videos. And now, to give you one last chance to boast your House came out on top this Housing Week, we rank the Housing Day t-shirts.
1. Dunster
Honestly, this was hands-down the best. #SorryNotSorry but no one can top The Office (even though it was a gimme reference).
2. Adams
We’re suckers for the color scheme of this shirt. The degree of extra with not one, but two, Latin phrases could have made this shirt go either way in the ranking.
3. Winthrop
We appreciate the Drake reference on the back paired with the simplicity of the front.
4. Cabot
This was pretty good, even if no one outside of Cabot understands the pirate ship—what happened to the cod? Bonus points for being extra and offering three options for type of shirt.
5. Kirkland
Bragging about the only thing they have going for them—dogs—and we’re not mad.
6. Leverett
Honestly, this shirt is really simple, but really aesthetically pleasing with the bunny on top of one of the “T”s.
7. Mather
Thank you for getting us hyped for Incredibles 2—the wait has been way too long. Is Mather really incredible though? You tell us.
8. Eliot
Everyone wearing this shirt must’ve felt like they had an elephant sitting on their chests. Not comfy.
9. Quincy
We get it, penguins can’t fly. “Fly Quincy.” Please end this bit.
10. Lowell
We like the play on construction, but the phrase on the back was, well, not great.
11. Pfoho
Seltzer?? No one likes seltzer! Honestly we’re just mad because we initially thought this was a play on the Klondike logo and we have never been more disappointed to be wrong in our lives.
12. Currier
Your hats were better.
