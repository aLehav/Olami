After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a tale as old as time: Cynical career woman Katherine meets hunky fireman Richard, who promptly sweeps her off her feet, both figuratively and literally. Drama ensues — perhaps Richard has a jealous ex, or a jealous mother, or a jealous orthodontist (you know how it is) — but, in the end, true love prevails. But we all know who the real hero of the story is: Katherine’s flamboyant co-worker Jim, who offers sage nuggets of wisdom in between sassy quips about how stripes make Katherine look fat. Why be a Richard or a Katherine when you can be a Jim? Follow this guide and you’ll be an adorkable relationship guru in no time.
5. Don’t have a life of your own.
As the quirky best friend, it is important that you have the perfect solution to any relationship conundrum. But, and it is a big but, you are NOT to have any such relationship conundrums yourself. You can mention a significant other once or twice, but they must always remain off-screen (unless they happen to also be a relative of the protagonist, in which case they can get one or two appearances). All other personal matters must fall by the wayside; you exist merely to serve Kimberly in her never-ending quest for true love. Your parents are getting divorced? Shut up about it. You lost your job? Nobody cares. What matters is that Kourtney accidentally smudged the number that JASON wrote down on her NAPKIN and now she’s worried that she’ll never see him again. You can get by on a week without groceries, but you know what Khloe can’t do without? An expensive bottle of break-up champagne. Which brings me to point number 4…
4. Be an enabler.
A reasonable person might come up with any of a number of solutions to Kendall’s burgeoning boy problems. But you’re not a reasonable person, you’re a rom-com best friend! That means there’s only one solution. Kylie has to decide between two handsome hunks? Maybe a mimosa will help. Kris got dumped for Brandon’s ex? How about some tequila to drown her sorrows. Kynleigh scored a date with the sexy delivery man? That calls for a champagne celebration!
When it’s not enabling Kynsleyeigh’s rampant alcoholism, it’s supporting all of her other bad decisions. The first rule of improv extends to being the quirky best friend, too. YES Kielbasa should quit her job to impress Mark. Of course she should crash Jeffrey’s wedding to say “I object!” Sure, some people might say it’s unfair to everyone else at the airport to delay Garth’s flight, but anything is justifiable in the name of LOVE.
3. Love or hate love.
That is, unless you hate love. As a quirky rom-com best friend, you have two choices with regard to your feelings on the L word (no, not that one; direct your opinions on the TV show to joy.ashford@thecrimson.com): Either be super optimistic or super cynical; there is no in between. The optimist waxes poetic about how Kryolan should never give up on love because there is SOMEONE out there for her (and the someone just so happens to be her delicious male model neighbor Bradley). The cynic, on the other hand, gets to play it coy. “I don’t know why you’re putting so much effort into Robert,” they might tell Kindle. “A dog can do everything a man can do while looking a whole lot cuter.” Of course, the only point of you being this cynical is so that you can have a heel-face turn at the end, cracking just the slightest smile when Kia Soul and Anthony have their romantic final kiss under the falling snow.
2. Prepare those one-liners.
As fun as it is, being the quirky rom-com best friend is hard work. You have to come prepared with your one-liners. Alternating between sarcastic wit and genuine wisdom, you should have something to say in just about any situation. Can’t think of any? Here are a couple of painfully unfunny wisecracks for just about any situation: “Oh snap, you did not just say that!” “You look like my Aunt Judy after two bottles of Bacardi and one unfortunate encounter with a leaf-blower.” “You want me to skip the Cher concert for this? Talk to me when you’ve had a number-one single on a Billboard chart in six consecutive decades.”
1. Be gay.
Apologies if you have made it this far only to realize that you don’t fit the bill. Reality is, the single best way to secure a spot in the quirky rom-com best friend hall of fame is to be a gay man or, in the words of Murray from “Clueless,” “a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streisand ticket-holding, friend of Dorothy.” Why do you think there’s such harsh rules against you having a partner of your own? And how else are you going to get away with giving Kylieighleighleigh a totally tubular makeover in a montage set to Dolly Parton’s greatest hits? With the inclusion of Dan Levy’s character in “Happiest Season,” we now know that this trope isn’t exclusive to movies about straight romances. No word on if lesbians are allowed anywhere near Kristin and Josh’s sordid love affair, though.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before you block out all remaining memories of this dumpster-fire of a year, take a walk down memory lane through some of the year’s best — and most fitting — Arts Board quotes.
March
"Men from Massachusetts are the worst" — Cassandra Luca & Allison J. Scharmann
"Hey! I'm right here!" — Connor S. Dowd
Why: It’s the calm before the storm. The members of the Arts board are eating Hot Cheetos, procrastinating their Social Studies essays, and, of course, making fun of men. Little did we know how much the world was about to change.
April
“I will run film as a Martin Scorsese cult hailing our supreme leader.” — Lanz Aaron G. Tan
Why: We’re a few weeks into lockdown, and the cult jokes haven’t quite lost their charm yet. Meanwhile, the inexorable Lanz Tan is capitalizing on the widespread chaos to quietly pitch the same “Raging Bull” retrospective for 5 consecutive weeks...
May
“THE HEAFPHOENS ARNT WOtkin” — an unidentified member of the Sam/Harper/Joe household
Why: Our favorite Arts-household is one again joining from one Zoom room, it’s chaos in the chat, and no one is quite sure what to do in a breakout room.
June
“I think it’s neat that on zoom ppl can mute themselves when they’re abt to sneeze. we should be able to do that in real life.” — Hunter T. Baldwin
Why: We’re all getting used to life on Zoom, the novelty hasn’t quite worn off, and we’re starting to ask ourselves whether doing class in our pajamas is really all that bad.
July
“Am i crazy or is paget brewster attractive.” — Hunter T. Baldwin
Why: We’ve watched every last Netflix documentary about tigers, cheerleaders, and the cute polar bear from last year’s Nature documentary. We’re bored, we’ve spent a little too much time hanging out with our parents, and we’re ready to lower our standards.
August
“What’s its actual name?” — Iris M. Lewis
“Frozen II.” — Caroline E. Tew
“That’s pathetic.” — Iris M. Lewis
Why: Kalos has written his third (fourth?) piece for the Arts Board on the “Frozen” franchise, which begins, yet again, with an intro about the snubbing of animated movies at the Oscars and ends with a rousing reminder of the joyful undertones of “Show Yourself.” Guess you gotta do something to pass the time these days.
September
“Siri, remind me at 11 P.M. tonight to eat my cheese.” — Kalos K. Chu
Why: We’ve forgotten what day it is, we’ve forgotten what “restaurant” means, and we’ve definitely forgotten to eat our cheese. Thank god we’ve got Siri to bring a little order to the chaos.
October
“so will my job end calmly or will the world explode ? who can say” — Amelia F. Roth-Dishy
Why: We’re all scrambling to stay motivated and “address edits” as a potential Civil War looms on the horizon.
November
“Little known fact... I’m a Republican.” — Iris M. Lewis
Why: This one’s self-explanatory. We’re watching the map start to turn red, we’re peering at the TV screen through our fingers, and some of us are getting ready to elope. You know who you are.
December
“You should quote me saying something sweet that encapsulates the year.” — Kalos K. Chu
Why: How are we supposed to sum up the downright insanity of 2020? I’m not sure — but I do know that in this challenging, chaotic year, the ever-quotable members of Crimson Arts were an indispensable bright spot.
— Incoming Arts Chair Joy C. Ashford can be found stanning the Arts Board and adding to the list of quotes, overdue homework assignments, and assorted admin links she reportedly keeps in a single, terrifying Apple note. For any urgent matters, please do not email her at joy.ashford@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Police Department Deputy Chief of Operations Denis Downing, who has been at HUPD for more than two decades, will take over as Harvard’s interim chief of police Jan. 1 as a nationwide search for a new department leader continues.
Outgoing HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, 74, announced in June he would retire at year’s end after helming the department for a quarter of a century. Riley’s final year in the post was consumed by controversy over incidents of racism and sexism within HUPD, accusations that he perpetuated a toxic work culture, and students’ calls to abolish Harvard’s police force.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp confirmed in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, published on Dec. 15 that Riley will retire at the end of the calendar year and that Downing will serve as interim chief until Riley’s replacement takes the reins.
Downing joined HUPD as a patrol officer in 1998 and has since risen the department’s ranks.
Downing wrote in an email to The Crimson it will be a “great honor” to serve as interim chief and that he and the department are open to reforming.
“We are committed to being a learning organization that takes every opportunity to learn from both successes and failures and continuously seeks to improve both how we interact amongst each other and the community,” Downing wrote.
The University formed a search committee in August to lead a nationwide search for Riley’s successor. Lapp told the Gazette that the committee has held 13 “listening sessions” with University affiliates — including students, faculty, and staff — to solicit their input on the future of HUPD. She also said the committee is in the process of reviewing applications of potential candidates and “will begin first-round interviews via Zoom early in 2021.”
“Our intention is to work hard to identify the right candidate and take the time to do so,” Lapp added.
In the meantime, Downing will lead the department during a precarious time for HUPD and policing more broadly.
A January 2020 investigation by The Crimson found incidents of discrimination within the department against female officers and officers of color. Nearly two dozen officers accused the department’s leadership of showing favoritism to certain officers and retaliating against others who spoke out against their alleged mistreatment.
As interim chief, Downing will oversee the early stages of HUPD’s implementation of recommendations set forth by an external review into HUPD’s policing practices. University President Lawrence S. Bacow launched the review following backlash over the presence of HUPD officers monitoring a Black Lives Matter protest in Boston.
The external review, published in a December report, recommended long-term philosophical reforms and short-term immediate changes, including the creation of a “diverse, active and engaged” advisory board to offer HUPD “guidance” and serve as an accountability mechanism.
In discussing the findings of the external review, Lapp announced the formation of two groups — a HUPD Advisory Board and a Facilitating Committee – to provide “feedback” to the department and to “clearly define the Harvard community’s expectations with regards to safety and well-being,” respectively, per her interview in the Gazette. The advisory board is expected to convene by March 31 and the facilitating committee is slated to meet by April 30.
Downing also wrote in his email the department is looking for ways to “reengage with the community” and establish new relationships across the University.
“I and every member of the HUPD will work diligently to serve the students, faculty, staff, and others who are part the Harvard community,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Second year Harvard Law School student Thomas B. “Tommy” Raskin has died, his father, Rep. Jamin Ben “Jamie” Raskin ’83 (D-Md.), announced in a statement Thursday.
“Tommy was pure magic. His brilliance and compassion knew no bounds. He passionately loved his family, friends, and animals, and was devoted to the cause of the global poor,” the statement reads. “We are devastated and demolished to be without him.”
The family did not announce a cause of death.
Thomas Raskin, 25, graduated from Amherst College in 2017. He had been a teaching fellow in the undergraduate course General Education 1171: “Justice: Ethics in an Age of Pandemic and Racial Reckoning,” according to his LinkedIn profile.
“Tommy is survived by his beloved sisters Hannah and Tabitha, dozens of loving aunts, uncles, cousins, friends and grandparents Arlene Bloom and Lynn Raskin,” the official statement added. “The family is grateful for the outpouring of support and love from neighbors, constituents, and friends but asks everyone to observe strict COVID-19 protocols during this time of grief.”
Raskin’s father is serving his second term representing Maryland’s 8th congressional district and formerly taught constitutional law at American University. His mother, Sarah Bloom Raskin, is a graduate of Harvard Law School and a former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union filed a grievance against the University and met with administrators earlier this month in response to Harvard’s decision to exclude 108 students in Population Health Sciences from the union’s bargaining unit.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers filed the grievance on Dec. 3 against the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Health. Population Health Sciences is administered by GSAS but housed for practical purposes in SPH. The University has until Jan. 6 to issue a formal response.
Union grievance officers Eric R. Cohn and Hannah J. Pinkham from HGSU-UAW’s Contract Enforcement and Education Committee presented the union’s case at a Step One grievance meeting on Dec. 16, which marks the first stage of the grievance process as laid out in the union’s contract.
The union alleges the University’s decision to exclude the students violated Articles 1, 2, 3, 18, and 31 of its contract, which define the bargaining unit and rights and protections associated with union membership.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email Thursday that administrators were unavailable to comment on the grievance this week due to the holidays.
Union representatives said they first noticed something was amiss at the end of September. After the union ratified its first temporary contract with the University on July 1, the University became responsible for deducting dues from union members’ paychecks and sending the union a weekly list of all eligible student workers in the bargaining unit.
Dues were not deducted from students’ paychecks at the School of Public Health, however, according to union Sergeant-at-Arms Maya I. Anjur-Dietrich. In response, the union filed a formal information request on Oct. 6 to SPH Dean Michelle A. Williams, inquiring about the dues deduction.
“Is it the SPH position that there are students named on the bargaining unit list that are not ‘student workers’ (SWs)?” the request, which the union provided to The Crimson, reads. “If this is not the position of SPH, why were dues not deducted from the stipends/salaries of SWs who authorized dues deductions?”
For two months, the union received no response to its information request on the dues deduction. From September to early November, HGSU-UAW was unaware that Population Health Sciences students were being excluded from the bargaining unit, as they had been included on previous lists provided by the University, according to Anjur-Dietrich. On Nov. 12, however, the union received a list that was missing 108 Population Health Sciences students.
The union moved to file a grievance against both graduate schools in early December, and the two parties agreed to meet Dec. 16. HGSU-UAW also ramped up organizing around the grievance; it gathered data about Population Health Sciences student worker pay, circulated a petition, and hosted an information session about the grievance proceedings.
On Dec. 15, the day before the meeting, the union received the University’s response to its Oct. 6 information request.
In Harvard’s reply, which the union provided to The Crimson, Associate Director of Labor and Employee Relations Brian Magner drew a distinction between “academic effort” and labor. He wrote that the money the excluded students receive is “solely in support of their academic effort and living expenses” and “not compensation for any services provided to the University.”
Magner wrote that the University “objects to the Union’s request because it is overly broad and ambiguous.” He also noted the University’s right to “make corrections to the list as needed to align the list to the bargaining unit definition.”
HGSU-UAW Communications Committee co-chair Emily M. Wright, herself a third year graduate student in Population Health Sciences, said she was frustrated by Harvard’s slow and repetitive responses since the union raised the issue.
“It’s been a kind of revolving door of confusion, concern, and alarm from the earliest information we’ve gotten about this,” she said.
Pinkham, the union grievance officer, said there were inconsistencies with the University’s justification, arguing that Population Health Sciences students perform similar duties as other graduate students included in the bargaining unit and should therefore receive union membership status.
“It seems like kind of an absurd technicality that they’re now saying, ‘Well, because they receive credit, they’re not part of the bargaining unit,’” Pinkham said. “So to us, it feels like an attempt to start to erode our bargaining unit piece by piece.”
Pinkham, Anjur-Dietrich, and Cohn called the exclusion “arbitrary” and said they were worried this case could weaken HGSU-UAW as it enters into negotiations for a comprehensive contract in 2021.
“It sets a really dangerous precedent if the University is doing this, and this kind of setup exists in other programs,” Cohn said.
Wright said her peers are concerned about losing workload protections and access to healthcare, dental care, childcare, and emergency funds during the pandemic without union membership.
Internally, HGSU-UAW will continue to recognize Population Health Sciences students as full members of the union, Wright said.
Should the University deny the Step One grievance, the union is “fully prepared” to file a Step Two grievance with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, according to Cohn. Garber would meet with the two parties and issue a determination on the grievance; if the University and the union cannot resolve the dispute at Step Two, the union can move to Step Three: third-party arbitration.
“Given past experiences, I don’t think we’re terribly hopeful that at this stage of the grievance process we’ll be resolving it,” Cohn said.
