After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Mary L. Landrieu (D-La.) recently sparked an uproar over her brokering of $300 million dollars for Louisiana in exchange for her vote to bring the health-care bill to the floor of the Senate. As a resident of Louisiana, I’m not offended—instead, I would like to thank her. Landrieu is not apologetic for her request, and there is no reason she should be. In fact, in a more just world Louisiana would be compensated for much more than $300 million.
Many Republicans are calling Landrieu’s provision the “new Louisiana Purchase.” However, it’s a bit early to assume that Landrieu’s vote has been “purchased.” She made an unequivocal preliminary clarification that her vote to bring the debate to the floor “should in no way be construed by the supporters of this current framework as an indication of how I might vote as this debate comes to an end.” She has stated that she will not vote for a version of the bill containing a public option.
Despite these statements, GOP backlash against the senator has been fierce. Some Republicans have called Landrieu a political prostitute, even labeling her the Magnolia Madame—ironic because it was not Landrieu, but rather a Republican senator from Louisiana, who was recently involved in a not-so-figurative prostitution ring. Landrieu should not be considered a “prostitute” in any sense; judging by her actions, “martyr” would be a more correct word.
In remaining firm in her position against a public option for the bill, she has risked alienation from the Senate Democrats desperately vying for its inclusion. She has avoided partisan pressure, faithfully representing the view of her constituents, who are staunchly opposed to a public option. In essence, she is doing her job, which also includes putting Louisiana on equal footing with the rest of the country.
Nor are the funds that Landrieu has inserted in her provision arbitrary pork funds meant to serve as a sweetener for Louisiana. The Medicaid system as it now stands is supported by costs split between the state and federal government. However, the share that the federal government pays differs from state to state, which means that some states with stronger legislators are paying less. Until Landrieu took on such a prominent role in blocking the filibuster this past weekend, she has not had the clout to affect the unfair legislation which has put Louisiana at a disadvantage.
In addition, a very particular quirk in the Medicaid formula has essentially penalized Louisiana for the recovery efforts going on in the state. Because of the large influx of insurance money and federal grants after Katrina, the per-capita income of Louisiana appeared to rise. In Landrieu’s own words, this formula makes Louisiana seem like Connecticut even though it remains one of the poorest states in the country. This has triggered a readjustment of the amount that the federal government gives to Louisiana, which essentially means that Louisiana will have to come up with an extra $472 million to continue providing Medicaid without any cuts of services.
Republicans are now using Landrieu as a scapegoat to mount an attack on the ethics of Democrats, but they fail to see that Landrieu is actually a moderate trying to protect her constituency. In the new media age of sound bites, the idea of a “new Louisiana purchase’’ is more potent than trying to explain an anomaly in the Medicaid system to the body politic. It’s worth remembering, though, that the Louisiana Purchase wasn’t so bad for America in the end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On October 27, 1995, at Fort Bragg, one Army officer was killed. On March 23, 2003, at Camp Pennsylvania, one Army officer was killed. On June 7, 2005, at the National Guard Headquarters in Tikrit, two officers were killed. On February 25, 2008, at Tinker Air Base, two children of an Air Force sergeant were killed. On May 11, 2009, at Camp Liberty, five soldiers were killed, and on November 5, 2009, at Fort Hood, 13 people were killed.
Each of these killings was an act of violence against our military families, committed by fellow American military officers. What all of the perpetrators have in common is not their race, age, or religion, but the shared experience of post-traumatic stress disorder.
It is estimated that 35 percent of American soldiers suffer from PTSD, and while officials may insist that incidents like this month’s shooting at Ford Hood are “isolated,” in reality, they are the unfortunate consequence of the trauma suffered by the men and women in our armed forces. Major Nidal Hasan, the latest culprit, would have known this better than anyone, having devoted his life to treating soldiers afflicted with PTSD, an alarmingly prevalent condition in the wake of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That a mental-health specialist would commit such an atrocious act of malice reflects the severity of this mental condition.
Yet this question has been sidelined by the mainstream media’s emphasis on Hasan’s heritage, to the great detriment of Arab and Muslim-American communities, who share the grief that all Americans feel for the victims and their families. While we acknowledge the existence of fundamentalists, we—as Arab-Americans—reject the immediate and exaggerated portrayal of this incident as yet another example of Middle Eastern extremism. Hasan was only one of the 3,500 military officials of Arab descent, and one of 20,000 Muslim Americans patriotically serving our country. He cannot, and does not, represent our communities.
It is unclear what Hasan’s motivations were, but regardless of whether religion played a role, his crimes cannot be separated from the historical context of intra-military violence, catalyzed by the difficulty of military sacrifice. Having recently received notice of his slated deployment to the very battlefields that so traumatized his patients, Hasan may have broken down emotionally—a psychological reaction that is not unique to any demography. Though there is no alleviating the consequences of his reprehensible actions, there is also little to be gained from searching for a narrative of religious or ethnic extremism. There is, on the contrary, much to be lost.
Hasan undoubtedly wounded our country and, specifically, our community, as Arab-Americans have also been implicitly incriminated in his crimes. At Harvard, we have not been immune from this suspicion, even as we mourn. Last week, we faced two additional blows that have exacerbated our precarious position: An event was displaced by the Harvard Kennedy School while another high-profile event was postponed by the College, both without our consent or consultation. In both instances, the administration has undermined our efforts to raise awareness about Arab-Americans, further marginalizing an already ostracized population.
In the former instance, the Harvard Arab Alumni Association’s annual conference, which attracts hundreds of students and alumni from all over the world, lost its venue for its keynote address. After months of planning and repeated assurances that the venue was secure, the Kennedy School decided to host a different event at the same time in the same place at the last minute.
Furthermore, a Society of Arab Students film screening and student panel aimed at dispelling stereotypes of Arab-Americans was postponed in light of the incident at Foot Hood. Yet no satisfactory justification has been given for the specific rationale, thus raising suspicion and confusion about the objective of our event. The decision implies the culpability and invites the rebuke of our community. Worse yet, the need for our event was made ironically explicit in administrators’ explanation that they had consulted, instead, with the Harvard Islamic Society, thus conflating disparate religious and ethnic communities. In fact, not only are there two thirds of Arab-Americans who are Christian, but also the vast majority of Muslim-Americans are not Arab.
Our community and its members have increasingly come under scrutiny and judgment in the wake of September 11th. Images of turban-clad terrorists and cries of martyrdom have become almost synonymous with our identities—even here at Harvard. We constantly seek to dispel these stereotypes, precisely because of the damage they incur on personal and political levels. Yet instances like these remind us that there is work to be done. We call on the administration to be more sensitive to the needs and experiences of Arab-American student organizations on campus, recognizing the uniquely precarious position in which we find ourselves in the wake of tragedies that affect us all, as Americans.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, Newsweek put out a cute video entitled “The Decade in 7 Minutes,” condensing notable news events of the past 10 years into a seven-minute montage.
While most of the content is free of editorial comment, the program’s treatment of one event stands out. As the year 2007 begins, the narrator of the video intones, “The U.S. undertakes a surge of more troops in Iraq. Opponents say it won’t work. It does.”
To be sure, this statement summarizes the media consensus about the surge. “The surge, clearly, has worked, at least for now,” The New York Times’s Dexter Filkins pronounced in August 2008, in an ostensibly unbiased news article. That December, National Public Radio political correspondent Mara Liasson declared that, through the surge, President George W. Bush had “corrected his mistakes” in Iraq and that “he is handing over a war that’s pretty manageable, if not almost won, to his successor.” “The Decade in 7 Minutes” is not even Newsweek’s first time promoting the surge in a straight news item. An October article by Holly Bailey and Evan Thomas ’73 included opposition to the surge as a mark against Vice President Biden’s judgment, stating as fact that the policy “rescued the American effort from near defeat.”
However, the notion that the surge “worked” in any meaningful sense is wrong. More importantly, this misunderstanding of the surge risks pushing the Obama administration toward a dangerous and unnecessary escalation of the war in Afghanistan.
For one thing, the injection of over 20,000 new troops was only one of several factors that contributed to the decrease in violence in Iraq in 2006-07. The Anbar Awakening of 2006 proved arguably more important: Sunni tribal leaders began taking action against al-Qaeda elements in their region and formed alliances with American military units to that end. While American military strategy certainly helped this campaign along, the process was initiated by local Iraqis and occurred far before President Bush announced the surge or sent more troops to Iraq.
The prominent Shi’a cleric Moqtada al-Sadr’s unilateral decision to freeze his militia in August 2007 was also critical. While Sadr’s motives are still unclear, the freeze held, ending violent clashes between Sadr’s forces and other Shi’a paramilitary groups. More morbidly, the success of Shi’a ethnic cleansing efforts in Baghdad left fewer Sunnis in the city with whom to spar and inspired the creation of defense barriers that prevented battles with those who remained. This is not to say, of course, that the troop increase did not play a role in decreasing violence in Iraq. But it is hard to argue that it played a definitive one. Indeed, most factors contributing to the decline were due to decisions made by the Iraqi people, not to American policy.
Even granting that the surge contributed somewhat to the drop in violence, it did not meaningfully help the American mission in Iraq. The actual security objective of the surge was to provide the security necessary for a political reconciliation that would prevent further ethnic conflict. By creating a reasonable level of safety, the theory went, the U.S. would enable Kurd, Sunni, and Shi’a leaders to take the risks necessary to carve out a lasting peace. This did not occur. Over a year after the initial troop increase, Baghdad was still in stalemate, and no further political compromise had been met. “Some slow, grudging political progress has been made,” Council on Foreign Relations expert Stephen Biddle ’81 told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April of 2008, but “the pace has lagged far behind the original intentions of the surge’s designers.”
More to the point, it is worth comparing the surge against its main alternative at the time of its implementation, namely a phased withdrawal. It is hard to imagine that either a quick redeployment, which liberals wanted, or a slower removal of forces as proposed by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group would have resulted in worse security outcomes for the United States than the surge produced. The Anbar Awakening, Sadr stand-down, and intra-Baghdad ethnic-violence exhaustion would have all likely occurred and reduced violence had the U.S. implemented one of these other strategies. Either would have greatly reduced the considerable human and economic toll of the war on the American military and taxpayers. The political situation in Iraq would have been, if anything, improved if the U.S. chose to leverage troop withdrawals to extract concessions from ethnic parties.
While remembering the surge accurately is critical for historical purposes, it is especially important in light of the ongoing debate over an escalation in Afghanistan. Those supporting the ramp-up have assumed that a troop increase would meaningfully contribute to a decrease in violence and thus to political rebuilding in that country. If the surge did not accomplish these goals in Iraq, miring ourselves further in Afghanistan will likely fail to provide the security gains that the strategy’s proponents promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Correction Appended

Just last night, at an Undergraduate Council General Meeting, the council voted to certify the contested results from last Thursday’s election, thus declaring John F. Bowman ’11 and Eric N. Hysen ’11 the future president and vice president of the UC, respectively. Finally, after three full days of voting investigation, Harvard’s student government has an officially elected successor. George J.J. Hayward ’11, a Crimson editorial writer, and Felix M. Zhang ’11 gracefully delivered concession speeches, heralding the beginning of a new chapter in UC leadership.
While we are relieved to know the names of our student leaders after a bizarre delay in election procedure, there is much about the events of the past week that raise concerns. Specifically, the Election Commission has demonstrated gross negligence and incompetence throughout this entire process. Despite the interconnectedness of these events, it is important to distinguish the actions of the Election Commission from those of the UC itself. In other words, the blame for this embarrassment lies with the EC, not necessarily with the UC as a whole.
When members of the EC suspected that the election results may have been tampered with—and subsequently decided to decertify those results—this was in keeping with a desire to ensure the election results were as fair as possible, and we agree with that decision. That said, however, EC officials should have been absolutely certain from the beginning as to which individuals had access to the results via the voting interface. Moreover, these questions should not have arisen at the last minute, although we recognize that Brad A. Seiler ’10, the former EC chair who resigned early Friday morning, had previously investigated these loopholes.
Worse than this unnecessary uncertainty on election night, however, was the gross lack of judgment the EC exercised in releasing confidential information to Kia J. McLeod ’10, current UC vice president and known supporter of the Hayward-Zhang campaign, among others. Why, for example, did members of the council know the vote tallies before the EC released them?
Ideally, the EC would have subsequently decided to certify the contested results after hearing testimony from FAS IT officials, who could have verified whether any foul play had occurred. But under the given circumstances, in which the EC’s credibility had been destroyed and its membership largely disbanded, no such reconciliation was possible. Thankfully, UC leadership pushed for the next best option—having the full Council hear FAS IT testimony and certify the election results in last night’s meeting. This was the only way the organization could have preserved any legitimacy in the eyes of its constituency. As a re-vote was impossible with one ticket (Bowman-Hysen) having been unfairly slandered, last night’s certification was the best possible decision the UC could have made.
On the note of the slandered campaign, all evidence suggests that Kia McLeod grossly neglected her duties on Thursday night by using the UC president’s email address without the consent of the UC president herself, Andrea R. Flores ’10. Moreover, that she and other former UC officials used that email account to assault Hysen’s character without justification was an egregious display of misconduct, not only because it constituted a personal attack, but also because it effectively made a fair re-vote impossible. For those reasons, the UC should vote to impeach McLeod and send the message that these actions were utterly intolerable.
Perhaps the greatest tragedy, however, is the toll that this year’s election has taken on the UC’s image, already significantly diminished by other recent ventures such as last semester’s consideration of 45 Mount Auburn Street as a viable solution to the social space problem. We recognize that neither the UC nor its representatives directly caused the chaos surrounding this year’s election and that blame largely lies with the Election Commission. Moreover, the UC as a whole should be separated from the e-mail signed by McLeod. Yet in the end these missteps on the part of individuals tarnish the reputation of the organization that they represent, and unfortunately the UC will have its work cut out going forward to regain the trust of students.
In the eyes of many, the damage has been done, and the UC has lost all the credibility it has worked so hard to cultivate over the past year. Harvard undergraduates deserve an organization with the ability to impact positive and lasting improvements to student life. What makes this controversy so particularly poignant is that it will undoubtedly jeopardize the UC’s ability to be that organization in the future.
CORRECTION: In the November 24th editorial "Undergraduate Circus," The Crimson Staff called on the Undergraduate Council to impeach UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod '10. However, "recall" is the official UC term for the procedure that the staff intended to endorse. The Crimson regrets the error.

CORRECTION AND CLARIFICATION APPENDED
Four days after polls closed and controversy erupted over allegations of election fraud, the Undergraduate Council certified John F. Bowman ’11 and Eric N. Hysen ’11 as the Council’s President and Vice President yesterday in a 33-2-4 vote.
Only George J.J. Hayward ’11 and Felix M. Zhang ’11, who lost the election to Bowman-Hysen, voted against certifying the election results that would hand victory to their opponents.
For days following the abrupt decertification of the election results shortly before they were scheduled to be announced Thursday night, students struggled to understand the turmoil that had enveloped the process—dividing the UC’s Election Commission and prompting three members of the body to resign in protest of the decision.
The picture that has unfolded, after the remaining four EC members voted Sunday to de-classify their meetings, is of four Election Commissioners who worried that insecure election software might have compromised the vote tally.
At yesterday’s meeting, Assistant Dean for Student Life Susan B. Marine presented a statement from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology Information Security department that said there was “no evidence to suggest any form of suspicious activity” with the voting software.
At the end of the subsequent two-hour discussion, the vast majority of the Council expressed their desire “to move forward” and confirm the election of the next UC president.
“I’m so proud of the UC for...honoring what the student body wanted,” said outgoing UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10. “I’m very happy that I’m a lame duck.”
Neither Bowman-Hysen nor Hayward-Zhang received the majority of first place votes due to the presence of a third-party joke ticket headed by Robert G.B. Long ’11.
Following the Hare-Clark voting guidelines, when no candidates received the majority of first place votes, the ticket with the fewest votes was excluded from consideration, and the first place votes for that ticket were redistributed to the second-ranked candidates on those ballots. This process put Bowman-Hysen in the lead with 45 votes—the closest margin of victory in recent history—despite going into the first round with 31 fewer first place votes than Hayward-Zhang.
In a short statement after last night’s certification, Hayward and Zhang expressed their congratulations to the newly named leadership.
In a short statement after last night’s certification, Hayward and Zhang expressed their congratulations to the newly named leadership.
Acting Commission Chair Phillip Morris ’12, one of the original commissioners to express concerns Thursday night, said he disagreed with the decision to give the full Council power to certify the results because many UC members have pre-existing political allegiances.
“It’s almost like Congress deciding Gore vs. Bush,” he said.
But Morris said he was happy with the investigation. “I’m happy...we will leave no doubts in the minds of voters or the campaigns,” said Morris. “Had we certified on Thursday night, there definitely would have been doubts.”
The meeting was focused on the concerns of the EC, but the controversial e-mail from Thursday night, signed by UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10, also came up in the discussion.
In a speech to the audience, McLeod said that her actions that night were motivated by a sense of urgency to try to preserve the Council’s reputation. The e-mail alleged impropriety in the election process, citing then-Vice Presidential candidate Hysen’s potential access to the UC’s vote database and calling for a re-vote.
McLeod acknowledged yesterday that the tone of the e-mail was “inappropriate” but said that she had only good intentions for the Council.

CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Nov. 24 news article "After Chaos, UC Okays New Leaders" misattributed a quote about the investigation of potential vote tampering to George J.J. Hayward ’11. In fact, the quote should have been attributed to Phillip Morris ’12.
CLARIFICATION
An earlier version of the Nov. 24 news article "After Chaos, UC Okays New Leaders" stated that an e-mail penned by Kia J. McLeod '10 alleged impropriety in the election process, citing "access to the UC's vote database" by Eric N. Hysen '11. To clarify, the e-mail stated that Hysen "might still have access" to the software and added that former Vice-President Randall Sarafa passed down all the UC passwords to Hysen upon his graduation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When he arrived at Harvard his freshman year, Alexander E. Johnson ’10 says he thought to himself, “This is a very irreligious place.”
A native of Houston and longtime member of the city’s 8000-strong, traditionally-black Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church, Johnson was raised in a highly religious African-American family. Growing up, he would spend at least three days a week at church, attending choir rehearsals, Bible studies, and oftentimes daylong series of services on Sundays.
So when Johnson arrived in Cambridge, he says he was struck by what he believed to be the relative lack of religious organizations. While students were open to talking about everything from physics to French literature, he felt religion was not on the discussion agenda.
While he didn’t join a Christian group on account of being “skeptical about everything,” he began provoking fellow residents of Wigglesworth Hall to engage in religious conversations. His second semester, he joined SoulFood Ministry, a black Christian organization on campus, after having dinner with its members in Annenberg Hall.
Now, Johnson is a certified minister, and he preaches on the second Sunday of every month at the Western Avenue Baptist Church, an African-American church that’s about an eight minute walk from Mather House. His services regularly draw a crowd of black Harvard Christians, he said.
For many minority Christian students, religious organizations that provide a core of shared cultural values imbue their members with a level of comfort that allows them to explore their faiths.
CREATING COMMUNITY
Some Asian Christians on campus say race-specific organizations such as the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Christian Fellowship engender a sense of community and solidarity.
Elizabeth P. Shen ’10, the daughter of Protestant immigrants from China, is on the executive board of the AACF. Coming from an Asian community in Southern California, Shen says that there are values shared by her Chinese culture and her Christian beliefs.
“I think to some extent, work ethic and hard work could be considered that,” she says. “I think that in a sense, the idea of working hard, getting what you deserve, and good deeds are values that are based in, at least in China, very much based in family values.”
Due to the Chinese government’s limits on religion, there are few Christians who are from mainland China, Shen says. Most Asian Christians at Harvard, she says, are Korean.
Grace I. Kim ’10, raised in the borough of Queens in New York City, is a Korean Christian. She comes from a family that attends church services every Sunday and that has a verse from Thessalonians written in Korean in their dining room.
Going to a Korean church at home contributed to her being more comfortable becoming a part of AACF than the multi-ethnic Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship, she says.
At Harvard, Shen says that a separate organization for Asian Christians offers more opportunities for leadership, where students can make connections more easily.
“I have an easier time making friends with people who are Asian, partly because of where I grew up but also because it’s easier for me to share similar values with other Asians,” she says. “And I think for example in any community and any organization, if you’re Asian, it might be a little bit more difficult to be as good friends with all of these Caucasians, Europeans, whatever, enough that you’re so well-tuned with that community that it’s just as easy for you to be president or whatever of a certain club or organization.”
DEFYING STEREOTYPES
SoulFood’s most famous event of the year—and what brought Johnson from first semester-skepticism to the black Christian organization—was its annual dinner.
“It really draws the black community because when they start thinking there’s chicken, they’re more likely to come out,” says Shelley J. Thomas ’11, an African-American Christian. “They will always come for chicken and cornbread. You can count on that.”
On average, both Thomas and Johnson agrees that most African Americans at Harvard are Christian, and that Christianity underlies African-American culture.
Thomas says that SoulFood has enabled her to be more religious than she was in her Philadelphia home by giving her a community and forcing her to make a choice about her own religion.
What makes adhering to some Christian tenets more difficult for African-Americans, she says, are certain “hypersexual” stereotypes.
“You could see that in the way black people are portrayed now: you got the movies, you got the dancing, you got things like that,” she says. “I’m trying to live right, but if I go out to this dance, I’m expected to dance like they dance in the movies. I’m expected to wear what they’re wearing. So I think that’s a little more difficult,”
Johnson echoes a similar sentiment, noting that college temptations prevent some students from living in accordance with Christian doctrine in the present, instead relying on the promise of future clemency.
“You have people who want to outsmart God. They say, ‘If I could do it today, why can’t I do it tomorrow?’ So they push things off until they think they’re ready,” he says. “I don’t know what they’re waiting for. Maybe they think they’re going to get holier overnight or more acceptable to God.”
But Johnson disagrees with Thomas’s idea that stereotypes disproportionately afflict the black community.
“A stereotype is a stereotype, and I don’t believe that the Harvard black community especially falls into category of individuals who play into a stereotype simply because the stereotype exists,” Johnson says.
He adds that there is much to unite African Americans around their faith, including gospel music and an upbeat preaching style. On this point, Thomas agreed.
“I might be humming something in class somewhere, and someone hears me and they know the song, and I already go, ‘they’re Christian. They have a Christian background,’” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the recent release of the University’s Library Task Force Report, some humanities professors and graduate students have expressed concern over the document’s suggestion that the Harvard University library system may need to limit future expansion.
The report, which was released on November 12, suggested that the library system unite its 73 different libraries under a common administrative structure and rely more on digital files than on physical books. The report stated that the system can no longer hope to collect all books in every field and must begin prioritizing its acquisitions.
“We shouldn’t pretend that we are maintaining excellence,” said Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas. “The fact is, ownership is really the only way of getting access to most of these materials.”
Members of the Classics Department, which relies heavily on old books for its scholarship, were particularly concerned about the proposed changes.
Among the changes discussed in the report was the possibility of closing departmental libraries within Widener and uniting those holdings into the larger library collection. But doing so would be “a tragedy,” said Andrew C. Johnston, a fourth-year graduate student in classics.
Johnston said that while choosing amongst graduate schools, he was drawn to Harvard in part because he knew that regardless of whether a book was available in circulation, he would be able to find it in the Classics library.
Members of the Classics Department also said they were worried about the department’s shrinking budget for repairing the books within its collection. When pages become loose or a binding breaks, the department is no longer able to guarantee that the book will be fixed.
Thomas said that the Library Task Force review follows several years of declining library resources. Last year, for example, the library faced a 15 percent budget cut, and the system’s largest unit—Harvard College Library—eliminated over 20 staff positions. HCL also eliminated duplicate print subscriptions for digitally available content.
But as administrators look to reduce the costs of storing physical versions of texts, professors point to the inherent value of obtaining hard copies.
English Professor Robert Scanlan said he thinks that the experience of wandering the stacks of Widener “is such a profound stimulus to the imagination.” But Harvard University Library Director Robert C. Darnton ’60, emphasized that “people should not misunderstand the report and take it as a draft for the library of the future.”
In contrast to humanities students’ and professors’ responses to the report, members of science departments said they were less concerned with the proposed changes. Chemistry Professor James G. Anderson said the debate between the sciences and the humanities on this topic has been an ongoing theme of faculty meetings.
“People view the library in very different ways,” he said. “All of those ways have to be respected.”
But Anderson emphasized that the sciences have transitioned almost entirely to electronic resources, which has meant more space for laboratories and lower costs surrounding the physical copies.
“Electrons are a lot less expensive,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Protesting a sharp increase in their health insurance premiums, about 20 of Harvard’s security guards and a small contingent of the campus Student Labor Action Movement group rallied in Harvard Square yesterday afternoon to advocate more affordable health care coverage.
Harvard’s security staff—employed through a subcontract with Securitas Security Services USA, Inc.—were notified earlier this month that their “contribution requirement” towards their monthly premiums under the company’s health insurance plan would increase by roughly 60 percent.
Passing out leaflets and holding “Health Care for our Families” signs, the security guards called for the University to cover them under the less expensive Harvard Pilgrim or Harvard University Group Health Plan, both of which are open to University employees.
While Harvard officials say that Securitas, not the University, is directly responsible for the guards’ health care coverage, the security guards have been pleased with Harvard’s willingness to cooperate thus far, said Matthew Gulish, an organizer for the local branch of Service Employees International Union, which represents the security staff.
Union members will meet with Harvard’s Labor and Employee Relations Director William Murphy this morning to discuss the possibility of extending Harvard’s health care plans to the security guards.
Meanwhile, the union will urge Securitas to help defray the rising cost of health premiums, Gulish said.
“We’re determined to keep up the public pressure on Securitas,” Gulish said. “Our goal is to make sure that Securitas feels the same sense of urgency that the guards do.”
Securitas is currently looking into alternative plans and will present them next week, Gulish said. The company has also agreed to push back the deadline for security guards to enroll in Securitas’ health care plan for the coming year from Nov. 12 to Dec. 4.
Arun Malik, a security guard in Mather House and a steward for the union, told The Crimson last week that if faced with higher costs, over half of Harvard’s security guards may be forced to opt out of their health coverage through Securitas and rely either on their spouses’ insurance or forgo a health plan altogether.
Harvard students at the rally patted the guards on the back and wished them good luck, security guard Kumar Dange said.
“The students were very receptive,” Dange said. “They know that we’re part of their family.”
While the union continues to push for lower health insurance costs, SLAM has been in touch with Gulish and the security staff to publicize their efforts, according to SLAM member Lucas M.F. Giveen ’13.
“When we see vast changes that negatively impact the lives of the least represented members of this community,” Giveen said, “we feel we need to publicly advocate and represent their cause to those who will have the power to impact the situation.”

Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 was on hand at the Institute of Politics forum last night to present the Sixth Annual New Frontier Award—an honor created in memory of her father John F. Kennedy ’40—to Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick J. Murphy and social entrepreneur Rebecca D. Onie ’98.
In her opening remarks to a packed audience, Kennedy discussed the importance of the award to her family, stating that they had taught her to believe that “you are never too young or too old for public service.”
She not only highlighted the legacy of her father, but also discussed the work of her uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, and aunt Eunice Kennedy Shriver, both of whom passed away this summer.
Murphy, who was the first Iraq War Veteran to serve in the United States Congress, discussed his difficult road from military service to public office as he accepted his award.
“Just like my time in Iraq and my time on the campaign, serving in Congress has tested me, often in ways I could never imagine,” Murphy said.
The congressman also discussed his efforts to repeal the military’s controversial “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy on gay servicemen.
Calling the policy “discriminatory,” Murphy said he was “privileged to be leading the fight” to repeal the measure, first enacted in 1993.
Onie, the other honoree, was recognized for her work with Project HEALTH, a program she co-founded as a Harvard sophomore to help low-income families address various factors which contribute to poor health.
As she accepted her award, Onie discussed her volunteer experiences in Cambridge that ultimately led her to found Project HEALTH, and she linked the organization’s work with the current national debate on healthcare reform.
“Our country right now thinks that health care is a disaster,” she said. “We at Project HEALTH believe that things can be different. Project HEALTH’s model is simple, it’s effective, and it’s cheap.”
Following the ceremony, Kennedy said she was glad to honor individuals whose service addressed ongoing social concerns.
“I think history has a lot to teach us, and I think the values are enduring,”  Kennedy said. “We can see that these issues have always been with us but that we’ve made a lot of progress.”
The New Frontier Awards, which are cosponsored by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and the IOP, are given annually at the Forum to two Americans under the age of 40 in recognition of their public service contributions.

A California State professor fiercely criticized the Obama administration’s foreign policy at a Harvard Law School speech yesterday for continuing what he termed the Bush administration’s policy of seeking to solidify American power.
As’ad AbuKhalil—a politics and public administration professor at California State University Stanislaus—offered a blistering critique of the Obama administration’s record thus far, focusing on combating beliefs that Obama’s foreign policy has marked a departure from the expansionist philosophy he said was espoused by the Bush administration.
As evidence, AbuKhalil pointed to similarities between Obama’s landmark speech to the Muslim world in Cairo and Bush’s speeches. He said both had a kind exterior but carried an underlying message that “Muslims would be tolerated, provided they do what they are told.”
AbuKhalil also criticized what he said was a limited range of viewpoints with influence over U.S. foreign policy.
“There is no marketplace of ideas,” said AbuKhalil, who said that Obama’s foreign policy chiefs meet too exclusively with representatives of pro-Israeli lobbies.
When asked what college students and faculty could do to influence foreign policy in the face of limited access to lobbies in Washington, AbuKhalil said that “the least they could do is insist on having free debate on college campuses.”
The audience fired back from both sides during a Q & A session after the speech, with questions and statements running the gamut from a blanket condemnation of pro-Israeli lobbying groups to suggestions that AbuKhalil’s call for and end to American influence in the Middle East was too radical.
Co-organizer Nimer Sultany, a doctorate in law candidate at the Law School, said that the event lived up to its purpose of giving American college students access to “facts and perspectives” about Middle East issues excluded by the mainstream media.
Stefan A.K. Gruber, an exchange Ph.D. candidate from Sydney Law School, said he appreciated AbuKhalil’s perspective because of its relative rarity on campus.
“I thought it was quite interesting, it was definitely a point of view taken which you will usually not hear at Harvard,” Gruber said.
But a few audience members said they wished the event, put together by the Middle East Law Student Association and Justice for Palestine, had offered an opposing viewpoint.
“It would be nice to have someone who is familiar with the other side to contest [AbuKhalil’s arguments],” said Ali Hamade, a consultant who attended the talk.

Norman P. Spack, a pediatric endocrinologist who works with transgendered youth, promoted the treatment of transgenderism as a medical condition, as opposed to a psychiatric disorder, during a talk hosted by the Harvard Transgender Task Force yesterday evening.
During the event, which was held to kick off Transgender Awareness Week, Spack said that looking at transgenderism from a medical perspective will change the public perception that it is a psychological problem.
Spack, the senior associate in the endocrine division at Boston Children’s Hospital, co-founded the Gender Management Services Program, a clinic that provides treatments to delay the onset of puberty in children questioning their gender.
“People ask me, how do people know at age eight or nine?” he said of children’s self-awareness of gender. “And I look at them and say, well how old were you when you knew?”
Spack said that stalling the start of puberty delays the development of physical characteristics that do not correspond to a person’s psychological self-perception.
According to Lily J. Durwood ’10, who works as one of Spack’s research assistants, the clinic is currently working with approximately 100 patients between the ages of 6 and 21.
“Dr. Spack’s help has made such a huge difference in the patients’ lives,” Durwood said.
About 35 percent of the patients served by the clinic have physically harmed themselves or contemplated suicide prior to seeking medical attention, Spack said.
“Post-medication, the patients give testimonies of better interactions in school, a better environment at home, and functioning a whole lot better,” said Stanley R. Vance, a student at Harvard Medical School who also works in Spack’s clinic. “Dr. Spack is a trailblazer in an area of medicine that hasn’t gotten adequate attention.”
Transgenderism is currently classified as the psychiatric condition “Gender Identity Disorder” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
However, Spack said that he and other members of the medical community recognize transgenderism as a medical condition and are pushing to have it viewed the same way by psychiatrists, insurance companies, and the general public.
“These people aren’t crazy,” Spack said. “It’s a medical condition.”
Members of TTF said they were pleased to hear a different angle on transgender issues.
“I think this event is a great opportunity to see trans issues intersect with the medical sciences,” said TTF member Jia Hui Lee ’12. “Trans issues have always been looked at from a social and legal perspective but never medical, and we’re excited to explore this intersection with the event tonight.”

In response to complaints of severe rodent infestation in Allston this February, Harvard spent roughly a quarter of a million dollars to provide North Allston residents with 2,600 rodent-resistant trash cans early last week to help alleviate the problem.
Some North Allston residents have been complaining about a rise in the rodent population, tying it to Harvard’s construction work on the still incomplete science complex.
“It’s absurd to think that blasting a massive hole in the ground isn’t going to cause a rodent problem,” said Jake Carman, a founder of the Allston Brighton Neighborhood Assembly. “The rats weren’t there before they started construction.”
And while University officials maintain that Harvard is “in no way responsible for any increased rodent activity,” the University agreed to fund the trash receptacles as “part of [its] larger partnership with the city and the neighborhood,” said Kevin A. McCluskey ’76, Harvard’s senior director of community relations for Boston.
The principal health inspector for Boston’s Inspectional Services Department, John Meaney, agreed that Harvard is not to blame.
“There would be rats in the neighborhood whether Harvard was there or not,” Meaney said.
The trash cans, distributed by the City of Boston last week, have been generally well-received in the community.
John Cusack, an Allston Brighton Task Force member and a recipient of a rodent-resistant receptacle, said that he loved the cans, calling them “a grand slam” and giving them an “A+.”
“They carry a huge amount of garbage,” Cusack said. “I can’t see any way that they could be anything but the best solution.”
But Harry Mattison, another member of the task force, said he was a bit perplexed by Harvard’s decision to finance this latest addition to the community.
“I was surprised to learn Harvard was spending probably close to a quarter of a million dollars to buy trash cans.” Mattison said. “Individual residents and homeowners should be responsible for their own trash.”
He added that this sort of involvement was “a strange direction” for the University to be pursuing, given earlier talk of providing “community benefits.”
“There was a lot of talk about education, public health—things that Harvard as an educational institution would be uniquely capable of providing,” Mattison said. “There was never discussion of free trash cans.”

After being quoted in a collegiate newspaper that he had “challenged” an economic study penned by two Harvard faculty members, a sociologist at the University of Texas has insisted that he was not formally critiquing their work, but rather providing an alternative explanation for the economic successes of certain societies compared to others.
An article in The Daily Texan last Thursday implied that Robert D. Woodberry of the University of Texas was challenging a 2003 study on the relationship between religion and economic growth authored by Harvard economics professor Robert J. Barro and his wife Rachel M. McCleary, a senior research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Barro, too, said that their work is not incompatible with Woodberry’s.
In their study, Barro and McCleary found that high levels of belief in heaven and hell led to more economic growth within developing countries, whereas higher levels of church attendance actually had a negative effect on economic productivity.
The root of their idea is essentially that individual religious beliefs can have a strong impact in cultivating positive values that lead to economic productivity.
“When we came along, people weren’t separating out belief from participation. Scholars were looking at institutions, religion markets, that kind of thing, but we were saying, ‘Why don’t we look at Weber?” said McCleary, referring to the well-known author of the 1905 work “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,” which argues that Protestant beliefs laid the foundation for economic growth in the West.
In contrast, Woodberry’s analysis has focused on historical analyses and data about missionary activity.
“What I’m looking at is the role of Protestant missionaries, mostly prior to World War II, in the spread of mass literacy, availability of texts, and various legal protections, which make countries have better current economic outcomes,” he said.
According to Woodberry, the religious competition provided by Protestant missionaries increased the quality of education by creating incentives for elites to commit resources to help the poor and historically disadvantaged groups.
By forcing the dominant groups to compete religiously in order to prevent conversion, missionaries played an important role in altering class structure and fostering economic development over time.
“Woodberry argues that the human capital effect was more important than the Weber-type effect, but they’re not contradictory, not at all,” Barro said.

In light of the investment losses suffered by the nation’s wealthiest universities this past year, schools with large endowments should adopt more conservative investment strategies, Tufts University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview with Bloomberg News last week.
“It may be the case that the wealthier institutions among us should be taking less risk—not more risk—because they’re less able to manage the volatility in their investment returns given their dependence upon those returns in their operating budgets,” said Bacow, a graduate of Harvard Law School and the Kennedy School, in the interview.
Harvard’s endowment—which funded 38 percent of the University’s operating budget in 2009—fell from $37 billion to $26 billion this past year. Harvard and its peer institutions have been criticized for their investment strategies, which rely heavily on hedge funds, private equity firms, and illiquid assets.
According to Bloomberg, the value of Tufts’ endowment fell by 25 percent this past fiscal year, from roughly $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion, after accounting for gifts and payout. Bacow suggested in the article that Tufts would avoid putting money in hedge funds, which he compared to “black boxes,” requiring investors to relinquish control of assets and put their trust in external managers.
Tufts Director of Public Relations Kim M. Thurler said that Bacow’s remarks were based on the performance of the Tufts’ endowment and were not directed at any other particular University.
While Harvard has acknowledged in recent months that its aggressive investment strategies may have constrained the University’s cash flexibility, it has defended the long-term viability of its approach. Harvard Treasurer James F. Rothenberg noted in an interview with the Harvard Gazette last month that the University’s investment strategies generated an average annual return of 8.9 percent over the past 10 years, including last year’s financial crisis—far exceeding the annualized 1.5 percent return that would have been generated by a “plain vanilla” portfolio of stocks and bonds.
“Certainly our endowment investment model was successful for quite some time,” Rothenberg said to the Gazette. “But I think, yes, there are some changes already under way to increase flexibility, reduce leverage, and better position [Harvard’s] portfolio for the future.”
Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin declined to comment on Bacow’s remarks.
Harvard Business School professor and Nobel Laureate Robert C. Merton said that some risk is necessary to ensure that the University can make a large enough return on its investments to support its operating budget. He said that he had not previously heard Bacow’s comments but added that “the right strategy for the endowment of any institution cannot be found in the abstract.”

The Harvard College Vegetarian Society’s Thanksgiving fell on a Monday this year, as the group hosted a Thanksgiving potluck dinner last night at the Lowell House Grille.
Alene G. Anello ’10, the group’s co-president, said that the potluck dinner was in its third annual iteration. It featured a lineup of food that included Asian fried rice, eggplant stew, roasted eggplant, and candied pumpkins, among other food items.
“It’s supposed to be an alternative to Thanksgiving,” said Anello.
Jessica M. Luna ’10, the group’s other co-president, added that the gathering provided an opportunity for vegetarians to celebrate the holiday together.
“A lot of people are the only vegans or vegetarians in their family and can’t eat a lot of Thanksgiving food, so it’s nice to have a space where all the food is vegetarian, and you can eat anything,” Luna said. “Also, a lot of turkeys are killed during Thanksgiving.”
The dinner’s atmosphere was welcoming, with soft music playing in the background and people conversing and laughing.
Anello welcomed everyone with an enthusiastic greeting.
Over thirty people came to the event, which is slightly higher than average for them, according to Anello and Luna.
“We have about two hundred people on the e-mail list, and between twenty and thirty come to our events regularly,” said Anello.
Many students attending the dinner said that they did not belong to the society and wanted to attend the gathering to enjoy the festive atmosphere.
“I’m not a vegetarian or vegan. I’m just really curious,” said Amanda E. McGowan ’13. “And the food was really good, too.”
Both co-presidents said that they were glad that non-vegetarians had attended the dinner.
“My mission isn’t to convert other people,” Luna said. “My mission is to show that being vegetarian is possible and delicious.”
The society has plans for a vegan ice cream social in the near future and said it is strongly behind Lowell House’s Meatless Mondays, which, according to Anello, is on the verge of being adopted by the Pforzheimer House dining hall.
The potluck dinner was not the group’s first event of the semester.
Earlier this year, the group filled an entire Science Center lecture hall for a debate between students and a representative from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
“We were worried that it would be hostile, but it wasn’t,” said Anello.

In a departure from a typical book reading, English professor Elisa New—who spoke to a small audience at Harvard Hillel yesterday night—read from her book in different accents and voices to fully capture the dynamic personalities of the characters in her memoir.
“There’s my little girl!” said New in a high pitched voice, reading an anecdote from “Jacob’s Cane: A Jewish Family’s Journey from the Four Lands of Lithuania to the Ports of London and Baltimore.”
New said she was inspired to write her memoir—which was published last month—after she came across her great-grandfather’s cane, which she had seen in family photographs her whole life.
“I felt the plates of history shift,” she said. “I felt that this cane was my pointer, my guide, to Jewish times I really knew nothing about.”
The book unites three diverse stories all belonging to her Jewish ancestors: her roots in Lithuania, the immigration of her great-grandfather’s family to Baltimore, and the re-immigration of three of his sons back to London to make their fortunes as cigarette magnates.
“I think that the book is poetic and really demands to be heard in voice,” said Harvard Hillel Director Bernard Steinberg. “To hear her embody the voice of her aunts really filled in a missing dimension.”
New spent nearly ten years traveling, researching, and amassing personal details about her family’s history in preparation for the book.
She explained that the information-gathering process was a family affair, involving her daughters and three aunts—Jean, Fanny, and Myrtle.
“Let me tell you, it wasn’t easy to get information out of my three aunts,” New said, laughing. “They mostly liked to talk about hors d’ovueres and how that girl looked so ‘bee-yoo-ti-ful.’”
New joked that she was worried that her research would never end until her friend, who was editing a chapter of the book entitled “Beautiful Machines,” helped her focus in on the core of the story she was telling.
“‘You can’t have a chapter about machines,’ she told me,” New said. “She reminded me that this was a story about people.”
New said she experienced a “strange satisfaction and feeling of peace” through her exploration of the many threads weaving her family history together.
At the end of her talk, one of New’s second cousins, Jack Abrams, thanked New in front of the audience and urged the crowd to keep their family stories alive by talking to their children.
“There are complete holes in family histories,” he said. “It’s been fascinating to see Lisa connect some of the dots.”
New is married at present to Director of the National Economic Council and former University President Lawrence H. Summers.

Before matriculating at Harvard Medical School in 2001, Nina S. Dudnik worked at a lab in the Ivory Coast. And what she didn’t see there became the start of a now seven-year journey to right the disparity between research in the West and in developing countries.
“They were unbelievably limited in terms of resources,” Dudnik said of the researchers in the war-torn African nation. Starting at Harvard Medical School only reinforced how wide the gulf was between a lab in Cambridge and one in Cote D’Ivoire.
The next year, Dudnik launched Seeding Labs, an organization dedicated to recycling unneeded scientific equipment to provide scientists in the developing world with basic tools for research.
The endeavor has since grown into an independent non-profit with student chapters at four universities, in addition to Harvard, and plans to expand to include biotechnology companies in the Boston area.
Dudnik said she hopes the resources her organization provides will allow scientists traditionally wanting for equipment to focus on local problems often overlooked by western researchers.
“Scientists in the developing world are best positioned to work on problems that affect their communities but do not have the resources to do it properly, so a lot of these problems go unstudied,” said Dudnik.
In recent months, the Harvard College chapter has been soliciting donations for a project to overhaul the research facilities at Kenyatta University in Kenya—one of the poorest nations on the planet. According to Michael F. Qian ’11, co-president of the Harvard Seeding Labs chapter, the school hopes to become a major research facility but currently lacks the equipment to compete with other institutions of higher education.
Qian said he and other student volunteers worked for two months to collect equipment that is now in transit to Kenya.
So far, the roughly 20-person chapter has focused on coordinating donations for research centers like the fledgling one at Kenyatta, but Dudnik said the organization—which also has chapters at Yale Medical School, Boston University, Mount Sinai Medical School, and Albert Einstein College—is expanding to help scientists in the developing world achieve parity in other ways as well.
“Sending equipment is the majority of what we done now, but we also have a collaborative online platform for scientists around the world to talk to each other, and we are starting training exchange programs,” Dudnik said. “And then the sky is the limit.”

Today’s announcement—that Northeastern University is discontinuing its intercollegiate football program after 74 years—sent shockwaves throughout the Boston collegiate football community. Boston University terminated its football program in 1997, and now, with Northeastern dropping its program, the city of Boston is left with just two Division I college football teams: Boston College and Harvard.
“The decision was a difficult one,” wrote Northeastern Athletics Director Peter Roby in an open letter to the university community, “made all the more difficult because of the respect and admiration I have for our coaches and players.”
Like Boston University, Northeastern officials cited financial reasons for pulling the plug on the program and stressed that the cut will financially benefit some of its stronger programs.
“I want athletics to serve as a source of pride for our community, while fielding teams that we feel can compete every time they take the field, ice, track, pool, or court,” Roby wrote.
Northeastern has deep ties to Harvard athletics, and today’s move was felt in the Crimson football front office.
“The obvious thing is it’s very sad,” Harvard football coach Tim Murphy said in a phone interview with The Crimson. “You hate to see college football opportunities go out the door…But I realize that these decisions don’t come without a tremendous amount of research and thought.”
According to Murphy, he’s known Roby “for close to 30 years,” beginning when Roby was a student at Dartmouth. Roby went on to coach Harvard men’s basketball from 1985-1991.
And the Harvard and Northeastern football programs have a contentious history of playing each other. The two teams had a four-year clash from 2001-2004, which according to Murphy “[coincided] with the best years [Northeastern] ever had.”
“They were right up there at the top of their league,” Murphy said.
The Huskies last won the Colonial Athletic Association conference in 2002 but fell to Fordham in the first round of the FCS (Division I-AA) playoffs. That year was also the last time they beat Harvard, taking the game 17-14 at Harvard Stadium.

Three Harvard cross country stars made the trip yesterday to Terre Haute, Ind. for the 2009 NCAA Division I Cross Country Championships. Running against fields of the nation’s best, juniors Dan Chenoweth and Claire Richardson and sophomore Kailyn Kuzmuk put in strong performances.
“The level out here is unbelievable. It is a great opportunity to compete at this level,” said Harvard coach Jason Saretsky of the championships. “We competed hard and put it all out there.”
“You have the nation’s best. It is really good competition,” Richardson said. “[It] kind of makes it fun to be in a big swarm of runners.”
On the men’s side, the expectations were high for Chenoweth after a strong performance at last year’s championships and his eighth-place finish at the Pre-Nationals Invitational in Terre Haute at the 8K distance just one month ago.
Chenoweth matched his impressive finish of last year, placing 42nd overall out of 250 in the 10K championship. He finished the race in 30:23.6, shaving 40 seconds off his qualifying time at the NCAA Regionals at Franklin Park. The time left him just 2.2 seconds out of the top 40, which would have earned him All-American honors, and within a minute of the top five.
Despite the strong finish, Chenoweth still hoped to place higher. The standout’s eighth place finish at pre-nationals suggested that he had a shot at the top 20.
“Conditions were pretty good, which doesn’t always happen. Looking back, I wanted to be higher,” Chenoweth said. “It was a tough race. I think that I was trying to switch gears a lot.”
The Crimson women followed suit with strong performances of their own. Repeat qualifier Richardson jumped up to finish 100th out of 254 runners with a time of 21:17.2. The performance helped her improve by 44 places over last year and marked a personal best at the 6k distance.
“Having a teammate here was very helpful,” Richardson said. “It made it more relaxed.”
Richardson also noted familiarity with the course helped, having been in Terre Haute for Pre-Nationals and last year’s nationals.
Saretsky’s advice to first-time qualifier Kailyn Kuzmuk was the same as to the others:
“You have to go out there and compete,” he said. “Relax and do what you’ve been doing all along.”
Kuzmuk placed 185th in the field, finishing in 21:55.4. Both Kuzmuk and Richardson handled the championship atmosphere, improving upon their times at Regionals. Along with Richardson’s career best, Kuzmuk knocked off 30 seconds from her previous effort.
“It was a lot of fun, a great learning experience,” Kuzmuk said of the competition. “[Richardson] is such a hard worker. It was great to know we could work together and do our best.”
The takeaway from the competition was positive, and the goal moving forward for Saretsky’s team is clear:
“We have the potential at Harvard to compete at this level,” Saretsky said. “It starts with getting ready for track and continuing to develop.”
Richardson added a similar senitment, saying, “[We need to] keep training and get into really good shape for the indoor season. It would be really great to bring a team back to nationals.”
The women’s fifth place finish at Regionals is especially promising, as the top two teams are guaranteed a spot with at-large bids coming after that.
For both teams, the top five finishers at Regionals, whose times count for the team’s total, will all return next year, which bodes well for Harvard cross country. With these three leading the way, the Crimson should have tremendous experience at the helm as it tries to send full teams to the 2010 NCAA Nationals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The clock was against him as tens of thousands of Yalies screamed to disrupt his game-calling. A tough defense stood in his way, and when junior Collier Winters got the ball back with less than twelve minutes in the game, he knew all of these obstacles had to be overcome in order for his team to be victorious.
After the offense’s dismal first three quarters, Winters performance in the fourth quarter propelled the Crimson past Yale, 14-10, in a thrilling style at the end of the season’s biggest game.
The thing that changed, according to the team’s captain Carl Ehrlich, a starting defensive lineman, was “execution. I don’t think schematically [the offense] did anything different. Momentum was on our side.”
The execution from Winters, starting in his first rivalry matchup against Yale, meant 95 yards thrown and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter. This capped off a day when Winters threw 211 yards and ran for 51.
The win was the culmination of a year of learning and growth for the quarterback, who was asked to lead the team after riding the bench behind Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09. One of the most important lessons learned during the season that helped the Crimson be victorious late in the game was Winters’ ability to manage the clock.
“I was given freedom as the season went on,” Winters said. “I was starting to see things better, as far as defense. Being comfortable playing and really just being able to see the defense better in order to get the right play. This made all the difference with time management being paramount on the final drives of the game.”
As successful as the last two scoring drives were, the offense had trouble gaining any momentum in the first half, as Yale scored early, and Crimson drives sputtered out—the most frustrating, according to Winters, being a fourth-and-goal stop on Yale’s one-yard line.
“Yale stopped our momentum and dampened our spirits.”
Despite the offensive frustration, Winters made sure that the team did not lose focus or become overly emotional.
“We were relieved that we weren’t down by more because we were outplayed terribly,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “[Yale’s defense] really completely reversed their tendencies in terms of how they play defense.”
The way in which Winters and the offense were able to respond in the second half demonstrated some of the experience quarterback has picked-up over the season as team leader. His optimism, with support from great play calling, made all the difference in the second half of the game.
“I knew that if we had enough chances, we would be able to get the points on the board,” Winters said.
Winters confidence on his side of the ball made the defense sure that they would come through on theirs.
“Your job on defense is to get the ball back to your offense,” Ehrlich said.
Winters was quick to show his appreciation for the offense after the game as he understood its complimentary role to his abilities.
“I was just comfortable with the guys around me being able to make plays,” Winters said.
With two of the three 30+ yard passes scoring touchdowns, Winters’ ability to connect with and understand his receivers was crucial to the success of the game.
“I’m confident in them that as long as I make the right read, they’ll make the plays,” he said.
For Chris Lorditch, the junior wide-receiver who caught the game-winning touchdown, it was his belief in Winters’s ability that made him confident that if he beat his man that the play was going to work.
“Collier put a ball to me, and it was just a great play,” Lorditch said.
The success from this year’s season, as well as the high note from this win, makes Winters hopeful for the year ahead.
“I think we’ll be in the hunt for it next year,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The charity stripe wasn’t so kind to the Harvard men’s basketball team last night at West Point. Taking advantage of its trips to the line, Army rode foul shots by a pair of guards—sophomore Julian Simmons and senior Josh Miller—to a 56-53 defeat of the Crimson.
Due to a team policy that prohibits players from talking on their cell phones on the bus, The Crimson was unable to speak to sources on the team before going to press.
“We definitely had our chances, but didn’t take care of the ball and didn’t convert at the foul line,” sophomore guard Oliver McNally wrote in a text message.
Sophomore Andrew Van Nest’s three-point attempt at the end of the game failed, depriving Harvard of the opportunity for overtime heroics reminiscent of the matchup against William and Mary earlier this season.
“You got to give credit to Army for playing well and really out-toughing us on their home court,” McNally continued in the text message.
The end result overshadowed a strong comeback. Down 21-7 with 8:16 left in the first half, the Crimson went on a 12-2 run to reduce the deficit to four points, as Army led 25-21 at the half. Harvard continued to rally into the second half. After co-captain Doug Miller’s traditional three-point play put the team up 30-29, McNally kept the momentum going as the Crimson extended its margin of lead up to six points.
“We kind of let down a little bit after we got a cushion,” Simmons said in a post-game press conference, according to Army’s official website. “We just had to refocus.”
Refocus the Black Knights did, never letting the lead go above six. Simmons scored eight points in three minutes to lead an Army surge. The last of these three baskets—a lay-up—evened the score at 46-46 with 4:13 remaining in the second.
“We just stayed strong as a team,” Simmons said.
From there on, the teams—which had traded momentum throughout the contest—would play evenly. The score would be tied twice more, and the lead would exchange hands.
“It felt like we were stuck on a couple of numbers for a long time,” Army Coach Zack Spiker said in the press conference.
The winner would be decided from the foul line.
The Crimson struck first as McNally gave it a 47-46 edge, but soon after, Army senior Cleveland Richards—the team’s leading scorer and a second team all-league pick a year ago—went two-for-two from the line to give his team a one point lead. The Black Knights would trade leads with Harvard for a while until a Simmons trip to the line would give Army the lead for good. After the sophomore went two-for-two, Army’s Miller gave the team insurance with a two-point trip to the line of his own. Harvard freshman Kyle Casey would score to bring the lead back down to two, but the Crimson would be unable to close the gap again. With seven seconds left, Crimson co-captain Jeremy Lin sent Simmons to the line once more.
By making one of his two free throws, the sophomore gave the Black Knights a three-point lead, forcing Harvard to try for overtime from the perimeter.
“I’m really proud of [Simmons],”  Spiker said. “He had a tough night making decision on shot selection early, but he was able to come through, and he hit a couple of huge shots.”
With one second remaining, Van Nest had the ball—and the game—in his hands. But the sophomore’s shot went wide, and Richards grabbed the rebound to control the ball as the clock expired.
But the missed three-pointer might not have been so crucial had Harvard not dug itself into a 14-point hole early. The Crimson committed 11 turnovers in the first seven minutes of the game, the first two coming from Lin. The opportunistic Black Knights wasted little time, using a 17-2 run to gain an imposing lead. A win may have allowed Harvard to celebrate its rally, but the loss means that the team will have to reflect on its inability to play with composure early in the game.
“We have a lot to learn from tonight as a team, but we have a quick turn around,” Casey said in a text message. “We need to refocus ourselves and get ready for wins.”
The win brings both the Crimson and Army to 3-1 records. The Black Knights have not had a winning season since 1985, but they downed Princeton on Saturday, defeating it 56-52. The Crimson lost both times it played the Tigers last year.

‘Tis the season for eccentric sports at Harvard.  Dunster’s Kevin J. Mechenbier has reinstated the Harvard Curling Club, which is returning to campus after a 4-year hiatus.  With the 2010 Olympics coming up, amateurs and pros alike can have a chance to play this popular – or, let’s face it, odd – sport that we all love to watch on ESPN.
So far, eighteen students have signed up to learn to curl.  Mechenbier is the only one in the club with experience, but he says he is confident that people will learn quickly.
Mechenbier describes curling as “very inviting for people who have just started.”  Indeed, Harvard hopes to send a delegation to National College Curling Tournament in March.  Here, there will be an entire division for teams with combined less than 5 years of experience.
For you curling newbies, here’s how the sport works: Two teams of four players slide heavy rocks down a sheet of ice toward a target, known as “the house.”  Sweepers with brooms –what is it with Harvard kids and sports with brooms? – help direct the stones on their journey.
Curling also boasts its own lingo.  Some of Flyby’s favorites:
-Biter (n) – a stone that barely touches the outside ring of the house
-Broomstacking – socializing (usually with alcohol) with fellow curlers after a friendly game
-Chip and lie (v) –when a stone hits another stone and thus comes to rest in an advantageous position
-Chip and Roll (v) – synonymous with chip and lie
