After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal court last month dismissed a civil suit filed by an unnamed student alleging that Harvard discriminated against him on the basis of race and gender in its handling of a Title IX complaint accusing him of sexual misconduct.
The May 24 dismissal came after the plaintiff filed a stipulation of dismissal on May 21 signed by the plaintiff’s and defendants’ attorneys.
The lawsuit, filed in 2018 in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, alleged that Harvard mishandled a Title IX investigation and discriminated against the plaintiff because he is an “African-American male.”
The suit details sexual activity between the plaintiff — referred to as “John Doe” in the case — and an unnamed female undergraduate that allegedly took place in April 2017. A month later, then-Harvard Title IX Coordinator Brigid Harrington informed Doe that he was the subject of an Office for Dispute Resolution investigation related to the April encounter, per the lawsuit.
The plaintiff accused Harvard of demonstrating racial and gender bias against him throughout its investigation, failing to offer him the presumption of innocence, and depriving him of a “meaningful opportunity” to respond to the charges against him. The suit named the University, the Board of Overseers, the President and Fellows of Harvard College, and Harrington as defendants.
The suit also alleged that Harvard “failed to perform a thorough and impartial investigation” into the Title IX complaint and that ODR Director William D. McCants twice declined the plaintiff and his accuser’s joint requests for informal resolution.
In November 2017, the College’s Administrative Board, which imposes sanctions based on ODR’s findings, determined that the plaintiff must withdraw from Harvard for four semesters, per the suit.
The suit further argued that Harvard’s sanction was “unwarranted and disproportionate in light of the circumstances.” It added that Doe had “sustained damages to his future education and career prospects as a result of the Decision and Sanction.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane and Tara J. Davis, an attorney for the plaintiff, declined to comment on the suit’s dismissal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled Monday that student-athletes can receive incremental increases to their education-related compensation packages, but the ruling will likely have minimal effects on Harvard athletics.
Though narrow in scope, the decision in National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston signaled a rare judicial victory for student-athletes and left the door open for future legal challenges that might go further in allowing salaries and other compensation for the use of student-athletes’ likenesses.
Before the case reached the Supreme Court, the lower courts affirmed that some of the NCAA’s policies against compensating student-athletes were unfair. Among these policies were “rules that limit scholarships for graduate or vocational school, payments for academic tutoring, or paid post eligibility internships,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his opinion for the Court.
The Supreme Court’s verdict, however, provides just a narrow victory for student athletes. It only applies to athletes in the highest levels of college sports: Division 1 men’s and women’s basketball players and football players from the “Football Bowl Subdivision,” the most competitive level of college football. Furthermore, the ruling only allows for certain increases in education-related compensation, namely scholarship and tuition costs, without guaranteeing salaries or any other compensation.
It is unlikely that Harvard athletics will experience any immediate effects after the ruling. For one, the University does not provide any scholarships to its athletes, but rather offers financial assistance through its universal need-based financial aid program. The Supreme Court decision only applies to scholarships and additional compensation for student-athletes.
Additionally, since Harvard does not compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the ruling only applies to its men’s and women’s basketball athletes.
Harvard football player Kwaku O. Adubofour ’24 said that while the decision would likely not change anything at Harvard, it still signaled a large step forward for student-athletes.
“I’m not sure how much it will affect us at Harvard, but I don’t see how this could go bad, I see it only as positive,” he said.
Adubofour said he was optimistic that the ruling might provide a strong precedent for student-athletes winning the right to secure compensatory deals outside of academic institutions. The ability to license and profit off of one’s own likeness and image is one of the most contentious issues between students-athletes and the NCAA.
Adubofour explained that some of his friends with growing social media followings would greatly benefit from using the Harvard name to secure followers and sponsorships.
“I hope this opens the door for more cases and less restrictions for athletes in the future, like allowing kids without any restrictions to make money off of their likeness, whether that be signing autographs and selling them or selling their cleats,” he said. “At the big schools, some kids won’t be able to afford food so being able to sell their cleats for however much money would be a big plus.”
In a statement following the Supreme Court decision, NCAA president Mark A. Emmert said the NCAA would work with Congress and student-athletes to resolve any such outstanding issues.
“Even though the decision does not directly address name, image and likeness, the NCAA remains committed to supporting [name, image and likeness] benefits for student-athletes,” he said.
Emmert acknowledged the narrow win for student-athletes, but also said he believes the decision ultimately upholds the NCAA’s jurisdiction over student-athletes.
“[The decision] reaffirms the NCAA’s authority to adopt reasonable rules and repeatedly notes that the NCAA remains free to articulate what are and are not truly educational benefits, consistent with the NCAA’s mission to support student-athletes,” the statement reads.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s graduate student union delivered a letter to University administrators Thursday morning signed by more than 500 graduate students pledging to organize a strike if contract negotiations between Harvard and the union are not resolved by June 30.
“We hope that Harvard will join us in reaching an agreement and avoid a strike, but we cannot accept an agreement that does not improve living conditions and working standards for all of us,” the letter states. “We are writing to inform you that if Harvard continues to reject essential improvements and protections, [Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers] will hold a strike authorization vote.”
The letter outlines several core demands, all longstanding points of contention between the union and the University: compensation, health care coverage, union security, and third-party recourse for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation cases. If these demands are not met in an agreement by June 30, the signatories of the letter — which includes all members of the union’s Executive Board and the Bargaining Committee — will move to organize a strike vote.
In December 2019, HGSU-UAW went on strike for four weeks in a bid to secure its first contract, ultimately moving to mediation and ratifying a one-year contract in July 2020.
The union and the University began bargaining for their second contract in March. After 13 bargaining sessions, the two parties have not reached tentative agreements on any of the core issues identified in the union’s letter.
With less than a week before the current contract expires on June 30, HGSU-UAW and the University have two more bargaining sessions scheduled for June 28 and 30.
At the latest bargaining session on Thursday, HGSU-UAW member Kai Morsink read a short statement explaining why he signed the letter.
“We’ve told you what it’s like to try and make ends meet on our stipends when inflation and rent in Cambridge keep going up and we’re trying to pay for an unexpected dental bill or support a family member,” Morsink said at the meeting. “We’ve told you what it’s like to be dismissed and undermined and told to wait when we bring our harassment cases through a Harvard process that hardly ever produces any consequences for abuse of power.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that the University will continue to negotiate “in good faith” with the union in the next two sessions and the smaller working groups the union and University set up to handle specific issues.
“The University is disappointed to see the Union raise the prospect of a strike at this stage, but we will continue in good faith to work towards an agreement,” he wrote.
At the meeting, Morsink said the letter is the union’s “bottom line,” and he hopes that it will pressure the University to accept their demands.
“I want them to come back and say, ‘Yes, we built it into the contracts: union shop, living wage, health care coverage, real recourse,’” Morsink said in an interview. “And then I want us to sign that contract and I want us to not have to worry about this anymore, at least for a little while.”
HGSU-UAW member Mo Torres said he wants administrators to take the union’s demands seriously.
“On the administration side, I hope they see we’re serious about wanting to improve our contract for this upcoming year,” he said.
Torres added that he hopes the letter will give membership “a bit of a morale boost” knowing that the union will continue to fight for increased compensation and benefits.
HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member Aparna Gopalan said she expects the current contract to expire without an agreement.
“They say they feel the urgency, but in practice, we don’t see that,” Gopalan said. “We’re expecting the contract to expire and then for negotiations to continue, and if there isn’t real movement, we are going to try to organize towards a strike authorization vote.”
Morsink said he is uncertain of what effect the letter will have, but that students will continue to advocate for the union’s proposals.
“The real answer to how this looks is, ‘I don’t know,’” Morsink said. “I just know that this is worth it to me and 500-plus other student workers to strike if Harvard doesn’t meet these demands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts State Reps. Michael L. Connolly and Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven introduced a bill this week that would seek to use the state’s constitutional oversight authority to compel Harvard to divest its holdings in the fossil fuel industry.
The bill cites the Legislature’s authority to act “for the benefit of the inhabitants of the commonwealth” in combating the effects of climate change and “to prevent the catastrophic destruction of the commonwealth’s natural resources.”
Connolly said in an interview Wednesday that the bill’s legal basis is rooted in the unique relationship between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Harvard.
“The original charter and funding of the College dates back to the colonial era,” Connolly said. “Inherent in our state constitution are these provisions that give the legislature some real power over the governance of Harvard.”
“I thought this was really an important and unique opportunity to use the legislative venue to further advance the efforts of students and alumni who are pushing for divestment,” he added.
Uyterhoeven — a Harvard Business School alumna — said she hopes the bill’s introduction will stress the importance of combating climate change and pressure more public institutions to act.
“The climate crisis, for me, is very much a power problem, not a knowledge problem,” she said. “We’ve known this for some time now, but it’s that previous generations have not stepped up.”
The bill, HD.4016 — An Act compelling the president and fellows of Harvard College to divest from fossil fuel — has received co-sponsorship from Reps. David LeBoeuf ’13, Jay D. Livingstone, Michelle M. DuBois, and Lindsay N. Sabadosa. Still, it has months to go before being marked up in committee hearings and reaching a formal vote, Connolly said.
The legislation came out of months of discussions with student activist group Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, according to Connolly.
FFDH organizer Klara A. Kuemmerle ’24 said in a press release Thursday that the state government has a responsibility to intervene.
“By continuing to invest in the very companies that have spent decades attacking Harvard’s own faculty, undermining science, and harming vulnerable communities, Harvard is being reckless and extremely irresponsible,” FFDH organizer Klara A. Kuemmerle ’24 said in a press release. “So long as Harvard refuses to act in the best interests of the university and Massachusetts as a whole, the state has no choice but to step in.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the pending bill, but pointed to Harvard’s pledge to transition its endowment to net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 and the school’s commitment to consider environmental, social, and governance factors in analyzing its investments.
The University’s fossil fuel holdings amounted to less than two percent of its $41.9 billion endowment at the end of fiscal year 2020.
The proposed measure follows a litany of legal action FFDH activists have taken to try to compel the University to divest. Earlier this year, the group filed a complaint and later met with the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 over the University’s fossil fuel holdings.
The activists and representatives involved in the effort said they think the bill is an opportunity for Harvard to send a message to other peer institutions to fight against climate change.
“Harvard has the potential to use its resources to become a leader in the fight for climate justice, but to do so, it must start divesting from planetary destruction and reinvesting in a just and stable future,” Kuemmerle said.
