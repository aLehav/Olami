After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A queen falling in love with a donkey. A black-clothed man speaking to a skull. Two young lovers declaring their feelings on either side of a balcony wall. Some scenes in Shakespeare have become so familiar, so ingrained within Western culture, that they act as shorthand for the plays they belong to. Sometimes, they even provoke recognition in those who have never read or seen a Shakespeare play in their lives. Many equally powerful scenes, though, do not achieve nearly the same level of fame. Troilus and Cressida’s uncertain, absurdist declarations of love might be familiar only to a handful of literature students; the comedic antics of Falstaff remain likewise obscure.
The Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s “Diamonds in the Ruff,” which ran March 25 to 26 at the Adams Pool Theater, played effective and entertaining tribute to such moments, assembling a sequence of lesser-known pieces from several different plays. The scenes came from comedies, tragedies, and histories alike, and the reason for their obscurity varied as well: Some were drawn from less popular works, while some usually lie forgotten within extremely popular plays. On the whole, each scene justified its own inclusion with bursts of clever wordplay, political eloquence, or raucous comedy, and while many other moments could have been included, nothing seemed obviously out of place.
The actors generally delivered their scenes with skill and enthusiasm. Maddy Granovetter ’19 and Casey R. Goggin ’19 produced particularly tight, animated comedy as a king and his daughter’s lover, and Alice F. Berenson ’16 portrayed a scheming, dangerous, sensual Hotspur in another standout. Nathaniel Brodsky ’18 and Jaime P. Herring ’17 also created fiery, bantering chemistry as Mercutio and Romeo.
Occasionally, though, some of the performances seemed more like poised, articulate recitations than actual acting. The characters in “Richard II, 4.3” spoke delicately and clearly, but often without recognizable or dynamic emotion—the staging, too, verged on the uninteresting and posed. And this flatness could become a problem for accessibility. Without plot context, and given the simple set and lack of costumes, the lack of emotional and stage cues sometimes rendered the scenes difficult to follow.
Most of the scenes nonetheless remained transparent, largely to the credit of inventive directorial choices. Shakespeare provides very few stage directions within the text, leaving directors a large amount of leeway to create their own situations and blocking: Kier W. Zimmerman ’19, an active Crimson news editor, did an especially clever job of blocking “Romeo and Juliet, 2.4” so as to draw out the innuendos and visual gags hidden within Shakespeare’s writing. Like a couple other of her fellow directors, she also made good use of the Adams Pool Theater’s various steps, mirrors, and (in this case, phallic) columns in the absence of any actual set.
Despite the show’s many successful (and some of its less-than-successful) moments of execution, the most important determinant of each scene’s success remained its basic suitability to the format. The best scenes in the collection tended to be the simplest ones: the direct sexual clowning and generational tension in “The Two Gentlemen of Verona, 3.1” shone, as did the tense marital struggle in “Henry IV, Part I, 2.3.” These scenes weren’t simple from a literary point of view—they’re extremely rich, of course—but their situations were instantly recognizable, and their physicality kept them entertaining even in the absence of actual plot dynamics. Among all the diamonds, they sparkled the most.

“That’s how it starts,” Alfred (Jeremy Irons) warns an increasingly murderous Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck). “The fever, the rage, the sense of powerlessness that turns good men cruel.” But this fever does something else to Batman—it makes him dream. In a jam-packed movie trying to lay foundations for an entire cinematic universe, the euphemism for a profit-maximizing web of interconnected movies, Wayne dreams of all kinds of comic-book scenarios. We see dreams of horror in his mother’s mausoleum; a wacky time travel bit; a desert dystopia of demons and a dictator Superman;and the greatest, most incredible, and most absurd dream of all: the fight between Batman and Superman.
Except that last one is the actual plot. To sum up criticisms of this movie: The plot is terrible. The two demands of the title—to make the two fight and to launch a host of Justice League movies—prove far too much for this script to bear. Both the fight and the inevitable team-up against a bigger monster are forced and implausible. But then again, this is a movie titled “Batman v Superman.” Surely the main issue here is not plot but spectacle. By that standard, it should be judged a success.
“Batman v Superman” picks up at the closing scenes of “Man of Steel,” which, like all superhero movies, features catastrophic damage to life and property in the background. But this time, the camera is not privy to Superman’s high-flying fight in the skies, which registers only as falling skyscrapers and distant laser beams. It remains impotently planted in the background, watching through the eyes of Bruce Wayne as the casualties rack up.
Much is made in dialogue and elsewhere about the contrast between Wayne, the mere human, and the indestructible Superman (Henry Cavill), who seems practically divine. The still more interesting contrast, artfully drawn through excellent lighting and cinematography, is between light and dark. This grim, bitter version of Batman inhabits a shadowy world of criminals––it always seems to be nighttime. But occasionally Superman flies in, effortlessly bulldozing some obstacle, and the shadows melt away around him. Dressed in shining blue and red, Cavill’s Superman is both perfect and emotionless. Superman might be good, but he’s utterly remote and unrelatable. So when Batman finally drags him down into the shadows, landing punches with satisfying crunches, it’s viscerally satisfying.
The film does not, however, lose track of scale in the fight between the two. The lazy way to handle the fight between Batman and Superman would be to put them on approximately the same level, with Superman’s flight and super strength evenly matched by Batman’s gadgets and martial arts training (this would be Joss Whedon’s “Batman v Superman”). But that would sacrifice the grand scale of this movie. Affleck’s Batman, despite his ostensible love of CrossFit, fights Superman only by cheating constantly, and against bigger, badder villain Doomsday he spends the entire fight ducking and hiding behind cover. And so “Dawn of Justice,” more than any superhero movie yet, remains spectacularly larger than life.
This movie set out to provide a spectacle, and it more than delivers one. When Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman finally appears, armored up and backed by a stirring medley of electric strings and drums (out of the thrumming, exhausting background score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL, her theme is especially exciting), the audience is essentially cued to cheer. Of all the famous superheroes, Wonder Woman is particularly in danger of looking silly in the transition from comic book to live action; in this movie, however, which sees her switch dazzlingly in combat from slow motion to dizzying super speed, she is thrilling.
In general, side characters add lightness to Affleck and Cavill’s deadly serious attitudes. Gadot’s Wonder Woman, sent flying momentarily through rubble, smiles briefly, in one of the best moments of the movie. Lawrence Fishburne, as Daily Planet editor Perry White, keeps wondering why Clark Kent is skipping work. Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor like Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network,” frustrated by the Winklevoss-like Superman’s perfect physique. But the supporting players pale in comparison to the pulse-pounding, city-pulverizing battle at the film’s center. Really, “Dawn of Justice” is the sort of movie best watched on the largest screen possible. Ignore the plot; it doesn’t matter. Enjoy the spectacle.

At 93, Namhi Kim Wagner is still redefining the ancient art of Korean pottery. With works featured in the Museum of Fine Arts, she is one of the first American ceramicists to revive the Buncheong style of ceramics—an aesthetic that disappeared from Korean ceramic tradition at the close of the 16th century. Gallery 224, a Harvard-affiliated art exhibition center, will host a selection of her works works from March 23 to May 21.
Not simply a revitalization of Buncheong wares, Wagner’s exploration into the rich history of Korean ceramics attempts to use history as a starting point for her original expression of art. “To transcend copying, she uses some materials other than just traditional materials. She adds color. She adds a certain dynamism that isn’t there,” says Robert Mowry, former head of the Harvard Department of Asian Art and senior curator at the Harvard Art Museums. “It’s within the tradition of Buncheong wares, but it’s her own contemporary interpretation of it—a technical and aesthetic relationship with it, [as well as] modern breakthroughs.”
Nancy Selvage, the former director of the Ceramics Program at Harvard, also emphasizes the distinctive characteristics of Wagner’s works. “She quickly went through the whole history of Korean ceramics—digested it—and then went beyond and made very personal, individual, expressive, new work. It’s a new contemporary contribution to Korean traditional work,” she says.
As part of a lecture series introducing Wagner’s works, Mowry elucidated the dramatic transitions that occurred throughout the history of Korean ceramics. According to him, the 15th and 16th century practice of Buncheong is critically important for an overall understanding of Korean pottery. Later Korean works, celadons and porcelains, find themselves heavily influenced by Chinese aesthetics and techniques. However, Buncheong wares encompass a separate visual landscape from Chinese wares, and are often considered folk pottery, a ceramic tradition relatively uninfluenced by international pressures.
“The basic technique of Buncheong wares is taking a grey stoneware, [a clay body] adding a coating of white slip, [a clay and water mixture] which is manipulated for decorative effect,” Mowry says, “whether stamping it, putting white slip into stamped intaglio designs, coating with white slip and incising or carving inside or coating with white slip and painting on the surface with dark slip.” Each facet of these techniques has a historical root—each Korean historical process that Mowry explains contributes to the ultimate form that Buncheong works take and Wagner’s works complicate. Part of what makes Wagner’s work important, according to Mowry, is that it introduced American audiences to a ceramic style that is a representation of Korean aesthetic thought, in contrast to later Korean ceramic styles, that blur the lines between the region’s pottery and that of China.
According to Wagner, the freedom of working with a medium with great diversity in form and decoration has encouraged her personal expression. “I want to be free and wild,” she says at the exhibition opening on Saturday. Many of her pieces feature fish—a traditional motif in Buncheong works that represents affluence or abundance—but Wagner used them to whimsical rather than symbolic effects. “My fish don’t have names; they’re just fish,” Wagner says.
According to Mowry, some of the most fascinating moments in her career take place when she subtly breaks from the Buncheong framework. “She imbues her wares with a distinctly personal touch that marks them as contemporary and that reveals her genius as a potter.” Mowry says.

No one could notice the pencil tracings under Paul Klee’s vibrant watercolor, “Newly Built Pyramid With the Eye of the Moon,” from afar. The 1919 work, no larger than six inches by eight, features both bright and muted colors, both geometric shapes and cryptic symbols. Yet underneath this dynamic surface are lines in pencil, suggesting the specter of a painting that never found itself on the paper. Even with the luxury of time that a museum setting offers the viewer, no one would see these almost imperceptible tracings, given the glass pane and the social decorum that usually require one to stand away from a piece. However, the Art Study Center, located on the fourth floor of the Harvard Art Museums, allows any Harvard student do exactly that: explore art without the barriers of a museum.
Robert Wiesenberger, Stefan Engelhorn Curatorial Fellow in the Busch-Reisinger Museum and part of the staff of the Art Study Center, selected the Klee work as one of his personal favorites from the collection. The watercolor, a 2015 acquisition, has not yet been on view in the museum galleries. “Klee is extremely inventive and variable with the media he’s using. He used every permutation possible over the course of his career,” Wiesenberger says. “It’s more than just subject matter—he’s using medium in a really interesting way. It’s wash, on paper, with pencil, but mounted to canvas, with other elements inside.” When the viewer is standing away or when the work behind glass, the elements that give this Klee drawing such vitality are more difficult to discern.
The Art Study Center’s resources extend far beyond the Paul Klee work. Approximately 132,000 works of the roughly quarter of a million total works in the Harvard Art Museums collections are works on paper. These works are more fragile and light-sensitive than easel paintings or sculptures and are therefore less often on display in the galleries. Most drawings, Klee’s included, suffer from light damage after only three months of exposure. But according to Wiesenberger, many of these pieces benefit from close, in-person examination. “In the Art Study Center, you can take a magnifying glass. You can inspect it,” he says. “You can see the reverse, see if there are any markings, or inspect the kind of paper, and [see] all of these subtleties, the different kinds of layering, the transparencies, the different kind of media they’re using.”
Klee was one of many artists, including Wassily Kandinsky and Herbert Bayer, who taught at the Bauhaus, a German avant-garde art, architecture, and design school founded in 1919 and suppressed by the Nazis in 1933. Wiesenberger said that the Bauhaus works in particular become both more meaningful and more complex with close attention to their material qualities. In one of Bayer’s works in the collection, the artist painted on canvas the letters for a typeset called “Bayer Universal” that he designed while at the Bauhaus. At the center of each letter is an almost imperceptible hole in the paper—the light mark of a compass. The way that each piece was formulated, the artist’s process, becomes a living component of an interpretation of the work. In a second Bayer piece, a mixed media depiction of a fictional multimedia headquarters, two long crease marks run down the center-left side of the paper. Was this intentional? Is it a product of a mishandling of the art? No one seems to know for certain.
The Harvard Art Museums hold the largest collection of Bauhaus works on paper outside of Germany, but their collection ranges far beyond the Bauhaus in terms of time period, place, and medium. “This is just a sample of the works at the Art Study Center. There are photographs; there are framed works, matted works,” says Mary Lister, Manager of Art Study Centers at the Harvard Art Museums. “There’s a wide range of materials—even textiles and ceramics.”

At a philosophical level, the union of glass with aquatic animalia feels like a fated match: on the one hand, the liquid medium; on the other, the lives lived in liquid—the artisan’s breath like the breath of God, giving organic form to what was once silica dust. There’s a metaphorical biology to glass that corresponds well with the biology of sea life. Both are keenly involved with the question of which forms are efficient and well-adapted, and thus most frequently brought into being.
The glass we buy is still: fragile and calm, content to hold forever its frozen form. But the glass of the artist is wild and molten. A hot, thick, slow-moving liquid, its primary allegiance is to gravity. It glows and blazes; it cannot be touched directly with the hands. Craftsmen spin globs of it on rods, whirling the sticky mass constantly to ensure it won’t sag. They blow into the soft glass through hollow pipes, and their breath expands it into bulbous forms. Like jellyfish, sea anemones, and the heads of hydroids, forms worked in glass tend towards the symmetric and the rounded. These are the easiest forms to produce—and the strongest.
The microscope’s bronze barrel injected horror into the natural kingdom, shocking onlookers, according to historian Isobel Armstrong, with “the gross feeding and sexual avidity of the animalcules.”  Through the looking glass of the microscope, late 19th century audiences fell into a surreal new dimension, at once scientific and strange. In the case of the Hydroid series, glass gives the Lovecraftian handmaids a sensuous vitality, shaping human energies into an imitation of organic styles. Blown through hot fluid, the breath of the Blaschkas opened naturally round bubbles, forming the transparent cocoons out of which our Hydroid’s babies hatch. The centripetal force of the artist’s spinning hand gathered into thick transparent drops the solid chains of sporosacs, as well as curving the trunk of the enlarged hydranth. Note, too, the fluid lines of that model’s fleshy arms. Underwater, liquid pulls the flowing tentacle; here, the flow of the artisan’s hand pulled the liquid of the glass. Instead of sharp stops, these limbs end in miniscule clear blobs. Like nature, glass smoothes away the hard edges of her works. The liquid’s desire to minimize surface tension melts fine points into balls—the characteristic bead on the end of each tentacle clues us into that collapse.
To retain a sense of marine translucency in their imitations, the Blaschkas brushed onto their shining surfaces thin, water-soluble colors—ironically producing sea creatures that could not survive fluid contact.  Even the oils on fingertips would dissolve such fragile tints. In the early 1900s, someone at Harvard transferred the models onto sturdy plaster bases; students could then hold these tiles without touching the glass.
The Blaschkas are known as lampworkers because of their miniature efforts: The rods of glass they worked with—no larger than pencils—were small enough to be heated by a gas lamp.  The Hydroid is their ode to the small and the exquisite. In his youth, Leopold was apprenticed to a goldsmith and a gemcutter.  In a departure from the lush organic forms of its grotesque assistants, the primary model recalls not the jelly’s tentacle but the jeweler’s hand.
This technical virtuosity is on full display in the Hydroid. Instead of pure glass, the Blaschkas rendered the soft twisting strands of Tubularia indivisa in glass-coated wire—the slight bend of the stalks produced not by liquid motion but by the crimping of the craftsman’s pliers. They threaded onto each wire the fragile bead of a hydranth, a hollow glass crown. Each thin, translucent flower reveals within an intestine of metal. Strands of pearly sporosacs float off in pairs from these heads, a twinning not present in nature but ubiquitous in contemporary earrings.
Not only does the model play on the jeweler’s repertoire of forms, it also asserts his profession’s dexterity of hand. Consider the delicate glass mane that adorns each pale hydranth. These vitreous eyelashes are vanishingly fine and totally uniform in their slenderness, evidence of the artisans’ remarkable muscular control. Repeating the same quick, disciplined motion, they achieved a shockingly consistent velocity in pulling out these strands. With a gemsetter’s surgical dexterity, the Blaschkas fused each glass hair to the belly of a hollow flower. This high risk endeavor was carried out with perfect precision—a single clumsy gesture could ruin hours of work.
Ironically, this very delicacy of detail also destroys the possibility of perfect realism. Glass melts easily and fuses without trouble: The material properties that enable the assembly of these thin hairs also require that they be placed with no possibility of overlap, lest strand dissolve into strand during annealing. The result is an object that nods to nature while being too dainty and stylized for a true appearance of natural spontaneity (compare the model’s ethereal fixity, for example, to photos of hydroids streaming freely in ocean currents).
The Hydroid delights the eye, but the body senses the artisans’ painstaking labors. Looking closely at the Hydroid, our eyes strain, hands twitch. Our backs tense. The creature is a miniature miracle. Juxtaposed with its microscopic enlargements, the Hydroid claims that the jeweler’s work continues—literally—at the level of the subvisible.
However, the Blaschkas brought to order what late 19th century viewers recognized as a dizzying, hallucinatory, bottomless progression of scale.  Although they traced all four of the microscopic enlargements on Allman’s plate, they produced only two for their catalog.  Viewers experience not a slide into an infinite series but rather a manageable tourist’s circuit: instructive but limited. In all three models of the Hydroid series, the jeweler’s hand tames the lush ferocity of nature.

Kanye West’s most recent album, “The Life of Pablo,” is his most amorphous release yet. The LP roves through different registers and is characterized largely by a frustrating aimlessness. The rollout of the album was maddeningly noncommittal as well; for months it was unclear whether it would sound more like a follow up to 2013’s “Yeezus” or like Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.” While this uncertainty is exhausting, it’s also exactly the point. “The Life of Pablo” as a phenomenon is focused on the possibilities of what it might—and could—be.
Let’s just take a moment to take stock of the different media involved in the rollout of Kanye West’s “The Life of Pablo.” Months before the album saw the light of day (and long before it was finished), back when its name was still “Swish,” there were already rumors of backroom listening sessions in the form of some late-night tweets from freewheeling Yeezy protégé Theophilus London and a Seth Myers interview with the Kanye-parodying Seth Rogen. We had the slow continuation of Kanye’s unraveling in the public sphere through what could be termed a month-long Twitter rant. Punctuating that messy Twitter chaos were glimpses of his studio, largely through a legal pad scrawled with celebrity signatures and an ever-changing, always-messy tracklist. We had the multiple SoundCloud singles, which, though normally a standard element of the album rollout process, nonetheless kicked off with the seemingly disastrous, confusing, petty, myopic track “Facts.”
And then there was the Madison Square Garden premiere, perhaps the most dense convergence of the disparate elements of West’s creative vision thus far in his career. While he had debuted new music at a fashion show before (for this same album back when it was called “So Help Me God,” no less), this event was on another scale completely, on every front, the models for his new fashion line covering a giant structure in the center of the stadium floor. Moreover, the album’s publicly live-streamed premiere was more direct and more widely available than the projections and grainy recordings that preceded “Yeezus.”
It wasn’t just about Kanye’s music and his fashion line, either; he announced an upcoming video game focused on his mother’s ascent to heaven and debuted two new songs from Vic Mensa and Young Thug. Both Vic Mensa’s “Danger” and Young Thug’s “With Them” mark important stages in their respective careers. “Danger” sees a continued intensification of Mensa’s image as he moves steadily away from the easygoing demeanor of his 2014 hit “Down on My Luck”; “With Them” continues the relentless pace at which Young Thug is expanding his masterful body of work, as it’s the lead single for his fifth full-length release in 12 months. “With Them” is part of Young Thug’s own vision, but it’ll always be linked to that momentous Madison Square Garden debut. Are “Danger” and “With Them” part of “The Life of Pablo”? Kanye has recently updated the album itself, notably “fixing” the track “Wolves”—where does the album start and where does it end? Every one of the album’s borders is permeable, from its relationship with his fashion line to its relationship to other artists to the relationship between its different iterations. Kanye isn’t the only artist with a creative vision that’s so diffusive, but of these he’s likely the most high-profile.
The murky cloud of mixed media surrounding Kanye’s most recent album is not coincidence or collateral; it’s deliberate. At its core, “The Life of Pablo” explores the mutable form of the album in the present environment of music consumption. That’s not to say it’s impossible to release an album in the classic sense nowadays; it’s just to say we take the fixed-medium form of past for granted. The release and form of TLOP takes into account many more aspects than only musical expression. He challenges the structured way in which we currently consume music with the album’s exclusive streaming on Tidal. He gently stretches the notion of what’s musical, as he confidently begins the album with a sample from a YouTube video of a four-year-old fervently praying in the back seat of a sedan. It’s not even quite clear where the album ends; he proclaims the track “30 Hours” to be a bonus track, but it’s placed right after a an interlude that’s titled as an intermission. West even uses the album’s liner notes—posted on his personal website—as a device for relieving suspense: “Facts,” which seemed to bitterly parody Drake and Future’s track “Jumpman,” was co-written by Drake himself.
As West’s album wanders through different corners of the Web, just as the music cycles through different registers, the album takes advantage of the diffusive nature of the internet to facilitate its own creative diffusion. “The Life of Pablo” focuses itself on permeable boundaries, ever-changing relationships, and an uncertainty of form. In that sense, it strives to be a musical expression of the internet’s form itself.

UPDATED: March 30, 2016, at 12:45 p.m.
 It’s a drizzly Saturday night, and the Harvard Film Archive’s cinematheque is buzzing. A stream of Harvard students, young couples, and film professionals mix and mingle between the bright red walls of the theater, preparing themselves for tonight’s feature: the works of experimental filmmaker and current Harvard professor Alfred Guzzetti. As the lights dim and film starts rolling, the crowd’s enthusiasm is palpable—hushed sighs, hearty laughs, and collective silence enhance the films’ most evocative moments. Even for a casual filmgoer, it is an electric experience. Visual and environmental studies visiting professor Adam C. Hart summarizes it best. “[The HFA] is one of those places where any night of the week you can just watch something at random and have your mind blown,” he says.
Tucked beneath the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the HFA is easy to miss. But as one of the most prominent university-based film collections in the United States, the HFA provides both the Harvard and Cambridge communities with an ostensibly endless array of historic cinematic material. University students and professors alike take full advantage of its collections, while weekly screenings ensure that even the most arcane of film titles goes watched. But the archive is more than simply an academic resource. Through its screenings and preservation efforts, the HFA aspires not only to highlight exceptional work that would otherwise go unnoticed but also to cultivate a space in which a film-watching community can thrive.
While the archive contains a number of academic papers, sound materials, and movie posters, its most distinguishing feature is its wide array of films. “The heart and soul of the collection are the film prints,” says HFA director Haden Guest. “For the most part, when you go see films today, they’re being shown in digital files.”
Guest believes that keeping the film in its natural state not only enhances the visual experience of film-watching but also preserves its rich history. “Our bodies are imprinted with a history of who we are, what we eat, where we live; it’s the same thing with prints. They wear the patina of all expressions of their life,” Guest says.

For VES students, having easy access to films in their original state is a main attraction of the archive. “It’s a fantastic way for all of us to enjoy films in a way that they’re supposed to be seen,” says Silvano D’Agostino ’18, a VES concentrator. “We get these actual film prints of these movies that look incredibly gorgeous, and it’s something we appreciate.”
Certain prints have established themselves amongst the archive’s most valuable possessions. “We also have a number of prints where their physical quality is so well preserved that they are now considered extremely rare objects,” Guest says. “The HFA has a beautiful original Technicolor print of Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Vertigo’ that was used as a reference print to the most recent restoration of that film.”
To build up its print collection, the archive contacts local film collectors, as well as talented former students. “We’ve maintained a really good relationship with some of our alumni, including Andrew Bujalski and Damien Chazelle,” HFA programmer David W. Pendleton says. “Darren Aronofsky sends us 35mm prints of each of his films after they’re made, which we place in the collection. We probably have the only 35mm prints of ‘Noah’ in the world.”
But while the sheer number of prints is impressive, the HFA also  prides itself on its diversity. “It’s a really rich archive and very unique in that many archives have a set purpose, collecting films of a given country or specific theme,” Guest says. “[The HFA] has a more expansive idea of: What is cinema—what is it today, what has it been, and what will it be in the future?”
Though the VES department integrates multiple disciplines into its curriculum, including painting, sculpture, and design, its involvement with film makes the HFA a natural resource. “VES is a department with a really distinct identity and history; film itself isn’t even mentioned in the name,” Guest says. According to him, the architecture of the Carpenter Center reinforces the core strength of the department: a multifaceted approach to artistic expression. “The way the ramp cuts through the building and allows you to see all the different arts… it argues for the simultaneity and dialogue between artistic disciplines, how they should all inform one another, and be a part of some rich engagement.”
VES department chair Robb Moss stresses the importance of the HFA to the overall interdisciplinary experience. “The HFA makes available to our classes its extensive holdings of films and projects for students in a state-of-the-art cinematheque,” Moss says. “The films, the expertise and generosity of the staff, and the viewing experience make the HFA an invaluable resource to our classes.”
And students agree: Having the archive available undoubtedly enhances the academic experience. “For our VES tutorial, we’re doing a project where we will be looking at one of the collections in more detail: We’ll interact with it, look at different things included in it, give a presentation on it,” D’Agostino says. “From the people who are visiting to full-time faculty here, there’s a lot of really interesting opportunities.”
“The HFA has a really amazing library of films,” Travis C. Morrow ’18 says. “I was really blown away by the screening of ‘The Saragossa Manuscript’ that the HFA offered last year.” Morrow, a VES concentrator focusing on film studies, appreciates the easy access to films otherwise difficult to watch. “The opportunity to see an unheralded masterpiece…. It’s just a dream come true for any film student.”
Daniel M. Claridge ’13 now cites his time at the HFA as critical to developing his own artistic vision. “I make my own films: short films, documentary, non-fiction; [the HFA] has totally changed the way I’ve thought about filmmaking. Our imagination is only about as big as the films that we see,” Claridge says. “I’ve had very memorable viewing experiences at the film archive that in some conscious or unconscious way influenced me. It’s just a really special way to watch film.”
In addition to its wide swath of historical material, the HFA draws in students and Cambridge community members with its weekly screenings, held four nights a week. “Our primary mission is to give people access to kinds of cinema that they wouldn’t ordinarily have access to,” Pendleton says. As programmer, Pendleton selects the films that the HFA will present at public screenings. “We consciously try to balance old films and contemporary cinema without a theatrical release, documentary, experimental cinema, international film,” he says. “We try to build as eclectic a program as possible.”

For many cinephiles, including VES concentrator Hugh A. Mayo ’18, the opportunity to see films with limited or no release is invaluable. “There’ve been so many times where I’ve been looking to watch more off-the-beaten-path films, and this is one of the few places they’re shown in the area,” Mayo says. “It’s really hard to get access to foreign films that may not have distribution in America, and the HFA really helps with that.”
While having no influence over what films are screened could frustrate some, Claridge considers the programming to be a benefit. “I think generally as a student, living at a time when there’s basically infinite accessibility and choice, the process of curating films is really important and vastly underrated,” Claridge says. “It’s wonderful to be able to choose the films you’re watching, but also there’s such incredible value to having the films you watch be chosen by someone else. There’s a really rich exposure to things I would otherwise never seek out on my own.”
The HFA’s screenings draw a diverse crowd of filmgoers. “When I’m there, I see a lot of regulars—a lot of people around Cambridge who are interested in film. A good amount of film studies students will try to get out to the screenings as well,” D’Agostino says. “For students, it’s more fragmented because they tend to be pretty busy, and especially because we already have screenings for our regular VES classes.”
However, Pendleton notes that the students who do visit have been fully integrated into the film community. “There’s always a handful of the real Harvard—or even Emerson and Mass Art—cinephiles who I get to know because they come to the screenings so often,” Pendleton says. “We often end up chatting.”
In addition to the sense of community, regulars often cite the positives of having a place to watch cinema other than at home. “When it comes to viewing a film, most of the time, bigger is better. There are some films that would benefit from being seen in a more intimate setting, but bigger is better in terms of classic cinema,” says Ned Hinkle, creative director of the Brattle Theatre. “Even if you’ve seen it a dozen times at home, you haven’t experienced it to its fullest.”
Running an archive does not come without its challenges, particularly for conservationists. “We never have as much money as we’d like to have for preservation projects,” says HFA conservator Liz Coffey. “Right now, we’re digitizing material and creating new copies, and the aspect of making new film copies is really expensive.” But Coffey stresses the importance of moving forward with preservation efforts. “You wouldn’t digitize oil paintings and call it a preserve; you would make the oil painting beautiful as well.”
For others, it is merely a problem of engagement. “The biggest challenge is getting an audience and choosing a film that people will spend their valuable Tuesday night coming to,” Hinkle says. He notes this difficulty is partially because of the Brattle’s marketing tendencies. “We do hardly any paid advertising and print,” Hinkle says. “We focus on our Facebook page and Twitter feed. The only thing we concentrate on printed-wise is our bimonthly calendar, which is a vintage way of promoting film, much like the HFA.”

Like the Brattle, HFA affiliates and regulars acknowledge the relative lack of awareness within the Harvard community. “I still haven’t figured out if it’s the typical Harvard problem of too many wonderful things to do on any given night or if the HFA just hasn’t pitched itself as the resource that it is,” Claridge says. “Sometimes I’ll talk to students in the VES department or [who] are ostensibly interested in film and they won’t have any idea where the archive is or where it’s located.”
Cinephiles tend to have the best sense of the archive. “I think as soon as you start getting into the film scene on campus in whatever way that might be—whether it’s the cinematic society or the film festival—you learn that the film archive is a thing that exists. Maybe the HFA could have some screenings that are more accessible to a broader range of students,” D’Agostino says. But he also notes the paradox of the situation. “Part of the purpose of the archive is to give the people who really care the opportunity to see stuff that they wouldn’t otherwise see. So there’s a certain balance to be struck,” he says.
Whether as a preservation center or cinematheque, the archive plays a number of roles in the cultivation of film culture. For one, it protects a number of critical film documents. “Most consider film the second most important medium for information in the 20th century after books, so having a record of what happens in that stretch of 100 years is so important, aesthetically as well as historically,” Coffey says.
Additionally, the HFA emphasizes the importance of recognizing newer talent in addition to more established directors. “You have a lot of older cinephiles who have nostalgia for the past, which is understandable,” Pendleton says. “But there’s still a lot to be excited about today, which is why we bring so many young filmmakers from around the world—to show that there’s a future not only for filmgoing but also for filmmaking.”
Part of the focus is combating the diminution of the cinematic experience, as people continue to watch films on smaller and smaller screens. “When I fell in love with cinema, it was very much a social experience” Pendleton says. “The focus is making sure that younger people learn to value that experience, as well as trying to transmit to new generations the value of seeing a film on the big screen.”
Hinkle also acknowledges the worth in making filmgoing a collective process. “It seems paradoxical getting together with people in the dark and not talking about something, but watching a movie is a community experience,” Hinkle says. “There’s a joint psychic bond that happens watching a film together with an audience, particularly comedies or romances or thrillers—films that elicit strong reactions. The emotional moments of a film hit much stronger when you’re experience it with a group.”
 
Between exceptional programming, opportunity to interact with award-winning filmmakers, and easy access to key historical documents, to say the HFA is a cinephile’s dream would be an understatement to most. Unlike traditional archives, it strives to develop a vibrant environment as much as it does to preserve history. “To me, this is a living collection. It doesn’t exist to just sit on the shelf; it exists to teach, to enlighten,” Guest says. “It’s here to share with the really dynamic, beautiful film community we have here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April 2014 President Faust created the Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention to investigate the problem of sexual assault throughout the University and to offer suggestions to combat it. Their answer? Hire a top-level administrator; institute “mandatory annual training” for students; and eliminate students’ freedom of association rights. The effectiveness of this approach in combatting sexual assault is dubious, but the expansion of administrative control over students’ private lives is clear.
In its report, released March 7, the committee called first and foremost for the creation of a full-time position in the Office of the Provost to oversee and coordinate the University’s efforts. Bureaucracy begets bureaucracy, a point that was not completely lost on the task force, which noted “it will be critical…to avoid the risk that over time this position may become bureaucratically isolated and ineffective” (emphasis ours).
In contradiction to this concern, the task force suggested a quintessentially bureaucratic list of duties for this new administrator, whose overall mission will be to coordinate and establish “institutional norms and culture” with regard to student sex, while failing to show how these duties would lower the incidence of sexual assault.
This assertion of administrative control in the moral and private lives of students is not novel. Prior administrations have already debated the value of restricting co-ed socialization through the imposition of strict parietal rules. This moralized proscription of student sex was fought over throughout the fifties and sixties and ultimately done away with in 1972 when Harvard implemented co-ed residency. Yet Harvard appears to be returning to a similar in loco parentis regime—a development indicative of the general administrative expansion across the University.
Harvard’s embrace of a “new sex bureaucracy” is made clearer by the committee’s suggestion that the sexual practices of a student body as diverse as the University’s can be defined and controlled by Massachusetts Hall. The recommendations prescribe annual mandatory “education and training,” which includes dictating the definition of “healthy sexuality,” and is designed to be “taken seriously, and internalized” (emphasis ours). President Faust herself, in a statement sent to University affiliates on March 8, claimed “the task force’s report speaks to Harvard’s most foundational aspirations and commitments,” including “values-based training.”
Her affirmation that students be trained such that they internalize the administration’s values is in fact not foundational, but rather anathema to Harvard’s liberal arts tradition. Harvard claims to build citizens and leaders through the “transformative power of a liberal arts and sciences education.” The spirit of such an education is rooted in rigorous intellectual inquiry, not the acceptance of administrative diktat. The recommendations to train students around issues as complex and personal as sex go against Harvard’s educational mission.
The committee also erred in its assessment of Final Clubs: It ignored the fact that over 75 percent of undergraduate assaults occur in Harvard’s own residential Houses, and instead blamed Harvard’s “harmful sexual culture” on the independent, all-male clubs, whose members make up 5-10 percent of the undergraduate student body. The task force suggested in an addendum report that Harvard force the all-male clubs to accept women, or ban “simultaneous membership in Final Clubs and College enrollment.”
The report acknowledged the correlation between alcohol-fueled partying and sexual assault, which we believe implies that forcing independent organizations to go co-ed would only lead to an increase in the high-risk encounters that lead to assaults. Their proposed alternative is to create a blacklist of non-complying organizations, thereby abridging the freedom of association—a bedrock principle of our nation’s constitution—for its very own students.
This latter course of action is particularly galling: Harvard appears to be moving towards a policy that would expel students simply for membership in a club, while it simultaneously fails to properly adjudicate sexual assault cases. The University is blaming an entire class of students for the condemnable and illegal conduct of a small minority—a clearly backwards approach to community safety.
Still, the report claimed that “the very structure of the Clubs—men in positions of power engaging with women on unequal and too often on very sexual terms” requires that they be abolished. This threat of the so-called patriarchy is a diversion from the unstated concern of the administration: That these clubs operate beyond Harvard’s jurisdiction. The report virtually admits as much: “Final Clubs undermine the centrality of the College’s residential spaces… [making] it harder for messages about community membership to take root—and for Harvard’s aspirations for its students to be fully realized.”
The net result of this report is to expand administrative control over students’ lives. We are witnessing a return to the College operating in loco parentis, as it attempts to both dictate social-sexual norms and limit students’ independence. Harvard bureaucrats continue to expand their numbers while also attempting to bring independent single-sex organizations, including the Final Clubs and the growing number of Greek letter organizations, under their control, if not to eliminate them entirely.
Unlike past debates about sexual mores and student liberty at the College, undergraduate students appear unperturbed by, if not supportive of, this assertion of administrative control over their private lives, while the Faculty of Arts and Sciences seems to have little influence with regards to the issue. The administration is leveraging the current political climate to achieve policy goals that will unfortunately do little to prevent sexual assault, but will certainly make Harvard more illiberal.

Harvey A. Silverglate, a 1967 graduate of the Law School, is the co-author of “The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America’s Campuses” and the co-founder and current member of the Board of Directors of The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Timothy C. Moore '12 works as a paralegal in Cambridge and was a member of a final club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I got cut from a final club in the fall, and it sucked.
While both of my roommates joined final clubs and were off at events and feeling “accepted” into a community, I was at home honing my FIFA skills. At the time, I was willing to burn the system to the ground. Final clubs sucked. Harvard’s war against them was justified. But, after a semester of review and the opportunity to take myself out of the discussion for a while, I believe that, instead, Harvard should actively seek to expand final clubs.
Recently, final clubs have been criticized for harboring sexual entitlement that in turn leads to sexual assault, as well as for sexism and elitism. But I don’t think these claims are realistic.
In their report to the student body, the sexual assault task force found final clubs to be emblematic of “sexual entitlement” by putting “men in positions of power engaging with women on unequal and too often on very sexual terms.” If this is the case, why is the discussion about fraternities on campus as hubs of sexual entitlement so limited in the report? It seems as though each group engages in almost identical activities: They throw parties, have meals together, and create a brotherhood. But it feels quite obvious to me why fraternities are an afterthought in this discussion on campus, meriting only a brief mention on the last page of the report.
Through hundreds of years of establishment and influence, final clubs hold power on campus that fraternities simply do not. People are innately drawn towards power. Many students will tell you they came here because you just can’t turn down Harvard. It is the power, the name, and the influence that draws some in the first place.
Sexual entitlement is a byproduct of that power— something that is built through experience. Someone only develops a feeling that they are entitled to sex when they have a lot of it. Sexual entitlement is never going away, whether Dean Khurana likes final clubs or not. The fact that a small group of men are given a lot of power due to their situation will not end if final clubs are abolished.
Sexual assault is a grave issue and something that needs to be a focal point in the College’s work in improving student life. But sexual assaults happen everywhere, not just in final clubs. The report does state that a woman at college is “half again more likely to experience sexual assault if she is involved with a Club than the average female Harvard College Senior.” But this statistic is contingent on how much someone goes out, and odds are that a girl going to a final club simply parties more often than others. Sexual assault occurs more commonly following a party than in a classroom. In a hypothetical world without final clubs, the same people who assault women now would unfortunately find new places to commit sexual assault.
Instead of fighting a battle against deeply rooted institutions in a misguided attempt at eradicate sexism and sexual assault, why don’t we work with the clubs to create a better, more inclusive future? Harvard could transform some of its extensive property in Cambridge into “clubs,” over which the University would have ultimate oversight. This would expand the social scene, mitigating the exclusivity issue. Similarly, with oversight like this, the University would be able to make sure clubs are in compliance with any rule set forth. This would in turn lower sexual assault and diffuse sexual entitlement. Would these clubs be seen as less legitimate at first? Without a doubt. But, after a while, they would become as integrated into the school as any other club, and be able to have a significant impact on the social scene of the school.
If we want to do something about issues related to social life on campus, why try to suppress what is already way too small a social scene? Instead, we need to provide more viable social options, so that there isn’t a forced reliance on what already exists.
My question to you, Harvard, is why does the fun have to be hostile?Jamie C. Stewart ‘18 is a philosophy concentrator in Dunster House. His column appears on alternate Tuesdays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the American Association of University Professors released a report stating that the growing federal role in combatting sexual assault has had a “chilling effect” on free speech on university campuses. The report suggests that some students have become so hypersensitive to the issue that they confuse intellectual discomfort from routine classroom activities with sexual harassment.
Meanwhile, Harvard is still reeling from last year’s results to its own campus climate survey, which found a startlingly high prevalence of sexual harassment on campus, particularly among graduate students. With seemingly different conclusions nationally and on campus, integrating the conclusions of these two reports is crucial.
Campus cultures across the United States have undergone a remarkable shift in recent years. Growing numbers of students have insisted that University administrators create “safe spaces” and demanded that their professors provide trigger warnings before asking them to engage with potentially unsettling content. The examples cited in the AAUP report clearly illustrate several ways that this movement can be taken to extremes. Yet at the same time, it is clear that sexual harassment is a pervasive problem on university campuses.
The study’s findings—particularly the notion that female professors in women’s and gender studies have been among the primary victims of sexual harassment claims related to their coursework—deserve to be taken seriously. (Some of the study’s authors are themselves leading names in the field). As this movement to make college campuses safer moves forward, it is important to consult the professors who helped spawn the undertaking.
As we work together to solve this problem, we must listen to and respect the voices of all those involved, including students who raise complaints that at first may seem tenuous. Even if we disagree vigorously with some of the most extreme claims of sexual harassment as we see them described in newspaper articles, we should restrain our impulse to label them "silly" or “ridiculous" without examining the facts of the cases in question.
To jump to conclusions on a subject of this delicacy is nearly always to miss the point. Administrations fail in their responsibility to protect academic freedom when they respond by revising the curricula, punishing the professor, or even allowing student pressure to harm a professor’s reputation. Instead, administrators must work to strike a balance between open discourse and accommodating students. Oftentimes, the problem can be resolved with simple measures like trigger warnings and more clearly written syllabi.

I’m notorious for being horrible with directions. I never know how to get anywhere, and over the years I’ve come to rely on Google Maps as I rely on my own mother. But tonight, as I lead a group of friends to Central Square, I’m going to a place that’s almost impossible to miss.
Nestled on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Lee St., People’s Republik, a Russian Communist-themed bar, has a startling exterior. Blood-red walls are streaked with lines of yellow and black, and they serve as canvases for huge murals. One painting features a blonde woman in a scarlet cloak handing you a flyer that reads “Eat Here,” with a header above her that states, “Join the Party.” Another is a portrait of a non-distinct Communist man—hazel eyes, dark black hair, wearing a classic navy green hat with a bold, red star stamped at the center of it.
Fun, semi-ironic paintings seem to be a theme at People’s Republik. Inside the pub, hanging on the same red walls is a black-and-white portrait of Lenin, and an alcohol-themed edition of Da Vinci’s Last Supper, with the dinner table replaced by a bar. 
The décor is definitely cheeky, but it’s not gimmicky. There’s a giant gray combat boot right above the bar area, which is a square placed right in the center of the pub. On opposite sides of the square are two games of darts, and scattered around the space are small circular tables with high bar stools. With the hum of soft rock in the air, smell of greasy fries, and buzz of patrons in their mid-twenties, People’s Republik has a homey vibe to it—one that doesn’t try too hard, but still manages to be good-humored and cool.
For a Communist-themed bar, though, the food and drinks are eccentric and surprisingly expensive. The food menu doesn’t have many items, but the items it does have are admirably diverse: They sell classic Philly cheesesteaks ($12) and mushroom banh mi sandwiches ($10), Salvadoran chicken flautas ($12) and Guinness beef stew ($13). Though their variety of drinks is solid, with many local pale ales and ciders, even their draft beer leaves you six or seven dollars lighter. They tout their Communist cocktails, from the “Green Bastard” to the “Bloody Trotsky”—I end up sticking with a craft cider and a plate of buffalo wings. The food is fine, but maybe at a price a little too steep for a place that bleeds red.
The crowd is also a little older than what I’m used to in the places around Harvard Square. It seemed to be comprised more of graduate students and young professionals than rowdy college kids. At a Communist-themed bar, you might expect to see Che Guevara t-shirts or at the very least Feel the Bern stickers, but the closest thing I find to a modern day Bolshevik is a man who I overhear lamenting about how his start-up is on the brink of collapse.
By the time my friends and I get ready to leave, our tummies are happily full and we’ve had our fair share of staring at Communists on the walls. We wave goodbye to Castro and his comrades and make our way back home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Loretta A. Preska, chief judge of the U.S. District Court of Southern New York, said she was concerned about reduced tolerance of free speech on university campuses in a lecture at Harvard Law School on Monday.
While Preska argued that there is widespread “decreasing tolerance for truly free expression and open debate,” she claimed that the issue is particularly problematic in educational settings.
“The limiting of public discourse is already occurring, and in my view, the most troublesome of those places is the place where the views of the future leaders of our country are formed: on university campuses,” Preska said.
Preska cited the establishment of “free speech zones,” or zones specifically set aside for protest, as an example of curtailed free speech on college campuses.
“A campus with a so-called free speech zone is one in which free speech is allowed in certain designated areas, but not any place else,” Preska said, adding that “these zones allow administrators to banish protesters to remote or marginal parts of the campus.”
Some colleges have also placed inappropriate restrictions on speech to prevent cyberbullying, according to Preska.
“The University of West Alabama has enacted a ban on cyberbullying, which it describes as ‘harsh text messages or emails.’ Colorado State University in Pueblo now defines harassment as anything that causes 'psychological and or emotional harm on any member of the university community,'” Preska said.
She said these policies, although noble in their intentions, are overbroad in their scope.
Using these examples, Preska emphasized that “speech should not be censored based on viewpoint, offensiveness, or anything else” because banning statements that are unpopular or not of the majority opinion undermines values promulgated by the Constitution.
“Not only was freedom of speech the progressive ideal on which our nation was founded, it remains something that distinguishes this nation from every other nation on the planet,” Preska said.
Some students also recognized that there are social pressures to sympathize with the most popular opinions.
“I think institutionally, Harvard does a really good job of maintaining free speech,” Hussein E. Elbakri, a student at the Law School, said. “But I think the social pressure not to say certain things, especially in discussions that affect race and gender, has been pretty prevalent in my classes.”
Trenton J. Van Oss, a Law School student who coordinated the event, said he was moved by the discussion. Van Oss is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative, moderate, and libertarian Law School students, which sponsored the lecture.

In an age where a problem set solution may be one Google search away, Harvard professors are more widely employing algorithms as an automated means to detect plagiarism in student assignments.
From the decades-old “MOSS” system to instructor-invented algorithms, such software allows professors to identify possible copying between submitted problem sets or Scantron sheets.
When Christopher L. Foote, a professor who teaches Economics 1010b, heard concerns that there may have been undetected copying on his exams this semester, he decided to add some safeguards to his testing procedure.
After a quick Google search, Foote found an October 2015 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research called “Catching Cheating Students.” Written by National Taiwan University Economics professor Ming-Jen Lin and Steven D. Levitt ’89, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and co-author of the book “Freakonomics,” the paper includes a “simple algorithm for detecting exam cheating between students who copy off one another’s exam.”
After creating his own iteration of the algorithm in the Stata programming language, Foote announced to his students Monday that he would be running the algorithm on the class’s upcoming midterm exams.
“I wanted to do what I could to protect the students who are working hard,” Foote said, emphasizing that he has no reason to believe cheating is “rampant” in Ec1010b.
Foote also said the process of determining whether similar solutions indicate plagiarism would still require human input and analysis.
While Foote’s use of an automated plagiarism detector may be a novelty among Economics professors, Computer Science professors have has been using cheating checkers for more than a decade.
For instance, CS50, the College’s introductory computer science course famous for sending high numbers of students to the Administrative Board, has used such a system since before the course’s current instructor, David J. Malan ’99, took over in 2007.
According to associate Computer Science professor James Mickens, computer science classes are uniquely susceptible to potential plagiarism. Mickens said that though the recent boom in popularity for computer science has drawn many converts, some do not expect the amount of “technical” knowledge required to succeed, which could lead stressed students to resort to plagiarism.
“It’s not because they’re stupid, but a lot of times until you do something, you don’t know what that thing is,” Mickens said.
Fortunately for instructors, Computer Science professors are naturally good at creating crafty means of detecting plagiarism, Mickens said.
“Typically CS professors like puzzles, so it does seem kind of fun to sort of, in this very dark way, to say, ‘how could I catch these malcontents?’” Mickens said. “It’s sort of like one of these CSI shows...you have to think like the criminal.”
Computer Science professor Jelani Nelson, who uses a plagiarism detection algorithm, said the logistics of running the program are enough of a “headache” that he only runs it a few times per semester.
While plagiarism detectors are well-known, they are not ubiquitous in Harvard's Computer Science classes. Some courses, like the infamously difficult Computer Science 161: "Operating Systems," choose to forgo a code similarity algorithm entirely, opting instead for a more structured in-class advising infrastructure to give struggling students an option besides plagiarism. According to Mickens, who co-teaches the course with Computer Science professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83, in many cases plagiarism is detectable without a computer’s assistance.
“One of the big signs of plagiarism is that some student has submitted something that they don’t seem to fully understand,” Mickens said. “A lot of times, you don’t even have to resort to sort of complicated plagiarism finders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eschewing their everyday identities as mild-mannered advisers, members of the Advising Programs Office donned bright-red capes at the kickoff event for this year’s superhero-themed Advising Fortnight in a packed Annenberg Hall on Monday.
Advising Fortnight is a two-week period during the spring when freshmen must engage in mandatory conversations about the fields of study they are considering. It was created in the wake of a 2006 vote of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that moved the declaration deadline for concentrations from freshman spring to sophomore fall, according to APO Director Glenn R. Magid, who was himself decked out in a red cape at the Annenberg event.
“The faculty recognized that there was a real need for a touchpoint in the freshman spring for students to be connecting with departmental advisers to have more in-depth conversations about their concentration choice,” Magid said.
These conversations, along with the Harvard experience itself, are intended to bring out different sides of people’s academic interests, Magid said, which was part of the inspiration for this year’s superhero theme.
“Dean [of the College Rakesh] Khurana speaks often and very eloquently about the transformative mission of Harvard College,” Magid said. “We in the [advising] office were playing with that idea and coming up with variations on the theme of transformation, and it was one of our very creative department administrators who struck on this idea of the superhero transformation.”
Khurana himself was present at the event—though missing a cape—and offered advice to passing freshmen as they perused tables staffed by concentrators and faculty members from the College’s 49 concentrations.
“I know concentration declaration can feel so heavy, but it’s not a tattoo. It’s actually just the beginning of an exploration of interests,” Khurana said.
Khurana went on to say that he hoped freshmen would begin their Advising Fortnights with an open mind to a variety of academic pursuits.
“I hope everybody approaches this with what the Buddhists call the beginner’s mind,” Khurana said. “Seeing everything anew, thinking about where their motivations are.”
Students like Andrew J. Jiang ’19, however, were not so willing to consider alternatives to the concentrations that they already had in mind.
“I’m pretty set on Economics,” Jiang said. “Today I just checked out the booth to get some more information about the concentration.”
Other students like Maxwell N. Benegas ’19 were much less sure of what they wanted.
“I’m just really unsure of what I want to concentrate in, so I’m trying to get a feel for a bunch of different concentrations,” Benegas said. “I picked five or 10 that I might be interested in, and I’m going to talk to the advisers and see what they have to say.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 28, 2016, at 11:22 p.m.
With its most significant work complete, Harvard's Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault has disbanded, leaving deans and administrators at each of the University's 12 schools responsible for acting on the report’s recommendations.
Earlier this month, the task force, consisting of students, faculty, and alumni from across Harvard, released a final set of recommendations to bolster sexual assault prevention efforts. Among many changes, the task force recommended annual sexual assault prevention training for all Harvard students and the hiring of a new administrator in the Provost’s Office dedicated to leading prevention efforts.
The task force began its work almost two years ago, and has since released two interim reports and helped conduct a University-wide survey about the prevalence of sexual assault.
Now, individual schools must develop plans to implement each of the University-wide recommendations. Steven E. Hyman, a former University provost and the chair of the Task Force, said the wide differences between each of the schools will make it more complicated to roll out the Task Force’s recommendations.
“We have a lot of recommendations where we understand that the College is different from the Business School is different from the Divinity school, and if we had a single implementation it would make no sense,” Hyman said. Many of the Task Force’s recommendations are specific to the College, including increased funding for school-sponsored social events and proposals to combat the influence of Harvard’s historically all-male final clubs.
The College has already convened two working groups that will submit recommendations to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana by the end of the academic year.
In an email, University Spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote Harvard President Drew G. Faust has "communicated extensively" with individual schools' deans, who are working alongside the central administration to begin implementing the Task Force's recommendations.
Hiring the new administrator to oversee sexual assault prevention will be a “very important step” in the implementation process, Hyman said, “even if it increases to some extent the size of central administration.” According to the task force’s report, the administrator will orchestrate the work of the Title IX officers and sexual assault prevention offices across the schools, develop educational materials, and evaluate prevention programs.
“The trouble with institutions, no matter how well motivated, is many different issues come up and grab everybody’s attention,” Hyman said. “So it’s really important for something as serious as this that somebody’s always got to be here who will not take their eyes off the ball and who is going to hold the different components of the campus to account.”
Given the number of offices that offered input to the report, including the Title IX Office and Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, Hyman said he hoped the new administrator will minimize competing messages.
“It’s fine for them to have different perspectives and sometimes disagreements, but you can’t let them drift apart and give confusing messages,” Hyman said.
While Hyman said his task force has laid out a map for the near future, he added that “over time things change,” leaving room for the schools to adapt the recommendations to their particular needs.
“You almost have to think of it as a chronic disease that you can never cure, but you always have to stay on top of,” Hyman said. “This is not like getting an infectious disease you can cure with penicillin. This is literally an infirmity of humans in certain contexts.”
The report calls on schools to have “implementation plans in place” by the beginning of the next academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As voting season for Harvard’s Board of Overseers formally begins and alumni around the world begin to find ballot cards tucked in their mailboxes, some prominent alumni are ramping up efforts to put the brakes on a controversial outsider campaign for the University's second-highest governing body.
That campaign, called “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard,” has garnered national media attention from outlets including the New York Times and the Economist for its two-pronged platform: make undergraduate tuition free and release more data about Harvard’s consideration of race in admissions. Every year, alumni elect five people to serve on the Board of Overseers, and this year the race has been particularly contentious.
The five unconventional petition candidates—headlined by five-time presidential candidate and Law School alumnus Ralph Nader and led by Ron K. Unz ’83—are facing escalating backlash, most notably from a pro-affirmative action group of nearly 700 alumni. The group, called “Coalition for a Diverse Harvard,” announced Monday that it would endorse five Harvard Alumni Association-nominated candidates for Overseers and urged its supporters to use all of their votes against the “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” quintet.
Jeannie Park ’83, a founder of the Coalition, said the group’s selection committee took into account each candidate’s response to a diversity-focused questionnaire distributed by the Coalition earlier this month, along with their background, personal statement, and published writings.
“We chose the group that we really feel would best support the goals of diversity that we’ve always stated that we were interested in supporting,” Park said. “After reviewing all of that, it did not change our point of view about the [“Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” campaign], and so we feel very strongly that we do not want the slate to win seats on the Board of Overseers.”
In an email, the Coalition implored its supporters to concentrate their votes against Nader and his confreres by voting for the endorsed candidates: Lindsay Chase-Lansdale ’74, Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92, John J. Moon ’89, Alejandro Ramírez Magaña ’94, and Damian Woetzel, a Kennedy School graduate.
“We understand you may wish to vote for another candidate, but please use your remaining votes on Coalition-endorsed candidates,” the email reads. “It is important that you use all five of your votes against FHFH.”
The Coalition is not alone in its condemnation of the petition candidates. In a letter to Harvard Magazine published Monday, five past presidents of the Board of Overseers denounced the group’s “ill-advised platform that would elevate ideology over crucial academic interests of the University.” The campaign’s proposal to eliminate tuition is “misguided,” the alumni wrote, and its “allegations of corruption and discrimination” in the admissions process are “wholly unfounded.”
One Coalition-endorsed candidate, Moon, said he was “delighted” to receive the group’s backing. He added that, in addition to sharing the Coalition’s views in favor of the use of race in admissions, he also objects to the roster’s proposal to eliminate tuition.
“I don’t know whether FHFH are aware of Harvard’s current financial aid program, but they are proposing free tuition for all but not including room and board,” Moon wrote in an email. “Under that policy FHFH would help the families who can afford to pay full tuition, and they would raise the cost of Harvard for hundreds of lower income families.  What’s free or fair about that?”
Unz said he was not surprised by the Coalition For a Diverse Harvard’s strikes on his campaign, and said he hoped he would be able to take his disagreements public in a debate before the election.
“The group opposed to us seems very reluctant to get involved in any public debate,” Unz said. “If their arguments are really as strong as they claim, that seems a very odd position to take.”
Park said she was not interested in debating Unz.
“We don’t have time. We’re too busy working on this election and trying to put forth the Coalition’s interests,” she said.
Overseers ballots will be mailed by April 1 and must be returned by May 20.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 31, 2016, at 5:45 p.m.
Drawing on recent narratives like that of the water crisis in Flint, Mich., renowned activist, television host, and Wake Forest University professor Melissa V. Harris-Perry lamented the way society silences the voices of women at a lecture Monday.
More than a hundred attendees crowded into the Agassiz Theater for the fourth annual Anita Hill Lecture on Gender Justice as Harris-Perry discussed the role of the modern woman in the context of current events and history.
Harris-Perry said the public sphere often neglects the opinions of women.
“If we don’t think women know anything, then when women tell us things, we won’t believe them. LeeAnne Walters knew that the water in Flint was bad almost two years before anyone did anything about it,” Harris-Perry said, referring to a Flint resident who pushed early on for a government response to the city’s stark decline in water quality. “It was not until the brave Virginia Tech boys came in when we finally had empirical evidence that fit the story and got people moving.”
The lecture series was inspired by Anita F. Hill, currently a professor at Brandeis University, who rose to public prominence in 1991 after she accused U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment as he was being vetted for the position by the U.S. Senate. The lecture series was created on the 20th anniversary of the controversy to highlight the activism that resulted from Hill’s testimonies.
Naisha Bradley, director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, which sponsored the event, lauded Hill for sparking a national conversation on sexual harassment in the workplace.
“Nearly 25 years ago, Anita Hill blazed a trail in unsettled terrain,” Bradley said. “Anita spoke up when it was easier to remain silent, sparking a national debate about sexual harassment.”
Harris-Perry also referenced the Thomas controversy and urged the audience to question how the events would have been shaped differently had Hill not been a woman.
“What if instead we had an actual set of hearings that took seriously the possibility of sexual harassment, took seriously the possibility of the practices and actions of Justice Thomas and, maybe most importantly,” she said to a cheering crowd, “had allowed a black woman on a public stage, speaking about her own experience, to be taken seriously in the U.S. Senate?”
At the conclusion of the lecture, Harris-Perry was met with a standing ovation. Attendee Erin M. McGrath said she was inspired by the lecture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Muddy water from a burst pipe rushed through the Harvard College Observatory on Jan. 15, flooding its collection of more than half a million astronomical photographic plates.
The glass film negatives were taken by astronomers from 1885 to 1992 at Harvard and other locations around the world. No other physical copies exist of these plates, though Digital Access to a Sky Century at Harvard is currently scanning and uploading these images online, according to Astronomy professor Charles R. Alcock, the director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Response teams transported 2,000 boxes, each containing roughly 30 plates, to freezers in order to prevent molding of the plate’s paper covers, Alcock said.
Astronomy professor Jonathan E. Grindlay affirmed that “the plates are not damaged.” Over the next year, each one of the 61,000 plates has to be unfrozen, cleaned, digitized, and placed back onto its shelf.
The response team was “absolutely magnificent,” Grindlay said. Nevertheless, the flood ruined much of the observatory’s machinery, including the scanner used to digitize the plates.
While there is no lasting damage to the plates themselves, observatory affiliates said they were initially worried that a large amount of history had been lost, according to Alcock.
“It was a sickening experience frankly because we didn’t know at the time how extensive the damage would be. You get over the emotional part and just get to work,” Alcock said.
These plates are extremely significant, as many astronomical events exhibit “small variations in a second, let alone in a year,” Alcock said. If the plates are damaged before they are digitized, there is no way to get that information back.
“These images were taken from telescopes from around the world over a period of a hundred years,” Alcock said. “They are an extremely important and unusual scientific record, especially for objects that change their brightness and color over time.”
Andrew W. Mayo ’17, vice president of the Student Astronomers at Harvard-Radcliffe and an Astrophysics concentrator, expressed his concern over the flooding.
“I was very worried because I know that the photographic plate collection at Harvard is extremely important to long time scale astronomy,” he said. “If the plates are damaged, then it can really put a significant roadblock in the study of long-term events.”
Due to successful conservation efforts, these plates will continue to further the study of astrophysics.

This article is the second in a series about sexual assault prevention at Harvard. The first part can be found here.
Last September, shortly after the University released the findings of a sexual climate survey, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith sent an e-mail to faculty members, encouraging them to support students and new programs targeting sexual assault.
“I hope you’re thinking, ‘What can I do?’” he wrote.
Now, after the release of a sexual assault prevention report earlier this month, the University's Task Force on Sexual Assault Prevention has outlined some suggestions:  “Faculty and staff must help reinforce the values and culture and guide students to resources,” the report reads.
Authors of the report recommended creating courses designed to foster discussion about sex and sexuality, training professors and instructors across Harvard annually on sexual assault prevention, and distributing a PowerPoint presentation to educate faculty about sexual assault reporting resources available for students.
THE ‘CORE’ OF CAMPUS CULTURE
Kennedy School lecturer and the Kennedy School Dean’s Chief of Staff Sarah E. Wald, who sat on the sexual assault task force responsible for the report, said she views the role of faculty as threefold: first, as scholars researching appropriate policies regarding sexual assault; second, as individuals in whom students trust after incidents of sexual assault; and third, and most importantly, as authority figures who are responsible for disseminating community norms and standards.
“Really at bottom, the whole initiative and the whole approach to Title IX is about having everyone feel like they have complete, full, and equal access to education,” Wald said. “So of course the atmosphere and the learning—faculty are at the core of that.”
Harvard Business School professor Felix Oberholzer-Gee, who chairs the school’s MBA program, agreed, adding that the responsibility for setting the tone around the values of a school is a critical responsibility of the faculty. While students cycle in and out of the school in rapid succession, faculty members remain a long time—perhaps a lifetime—and have a unique role in creating and understanding campus culture.
“It needs to come from us to say: here are the rules, and here is what we aspire to as a community, and here is how we want to relate to one another,” Oberholzer-Gee said. He emphasized that faculty’s leadership in the classroom extended naturally outside of it—to think otherwise would be to  “compartmentalize” leadership inappropriately, he said.
INSTRUCTING THE FACULTY
The Task Force’s final report recommends a streamlined approach in teaching professors across Harvard to respond to allegations of sexual assault.
Prior to the release of the Task Force’s final report, several departments within FAS had already started to focus on training faculty members, instructors, and graduate students about appropriate interactions and sexual assault reporting procedures.
Still, professors need clear and consistent instruction about what constitutes sexual misconduct so they do not perpetuate the issue and can serve as resources for students, History professor Alison F. Johnson, a member of the Task Force, said.
“Your typical faculty member or instructor isn’t necessarily the best person to support someone who’s experienced sexual violence, but our faculty members and instructors can be the people who share information about where to find those people, that are the best people to talk to, with students,” she said.
Instruction can also make faculty more aware of potential discomfort students may feel in interacting with them. Philosophy Department Chair Edward J. Hall said professors should be careful when organizing off-campus student-faculty thesis research or lunch meetings with students of the opposite sex.
“How an interaction looks for a student can be very different from the perspective of a faculty member,” Hall said. “[Faculty should] bear in mind that something can come off as creepy. That’s really important.”
And beyond increased faculty awareness of appropriate behavior, other Harvard schools are trying to educate their faculty on what sexual life on campus looks like so they are better equipped to understand students’ perspectives and engage with them.
To that end, Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, for instance, said he has been meeting with discussion groups of six to eight faculty members over lunch.
“A part of the conversation [is] just to give people a real sense of what sex life is like today: how often do people have sex, with who do they have sex, how do people think about sex,” Oberholzer-Gee, the Business School professor, said. “It’s not something that everybody just happens to know.”
IN THE CLASSROOM
Faculty also see the undergraduate curriculum as an opportunity for further discussions about sexual assault and harassment prevention.
Currently, in addition to courses in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Concentration, FAS offers a General Education course on sexuality, Ethical Reasoning 42: “Sexual Ethics as Ethical Reasoning.” The course—introduced this spring—asks students to challenge their preconceived notions about sex and morality, and, according to its syllabus, aims to enable students to recognize that human sexuality involves a complex consideration of topics.
“Ethical reasoning about sex cannot begin by asking whether particular acts or relations are permitted or prohibited,” the syllabus reads. “It needs to start much further back, with questions about what ‘sex’ means and then about what might be ethically problematic in it.”
Divinity School professor Mark D. Jordan, who teaches the course, wrote in an email that discussions about sexuality should have a place in Harvard’s classrooms.
“I do think that ER 42 and courses like it can help expand the ways we talk about sexual assault—not least by understanding them as education rather than just training,” Jordan wrote.
Building on the model of ER 42, the Task Force’s report proposed the creation of “a team-taught undergraduate course that addresses the subject of sex from a variety of disciplinary perspectives,” and faculty may hail from outside of FAS.
“I would love to see a Gen Ed course on sex,” Johnson, the History professor, said, adding that she envisions such a course would draw large enrollment numbers and similar enthusiasm to Government professor Michael J. Sandel’s globally popular (and now retired) course, Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice.”
“Students who take this course don’t all have to agree about what constitutes good sex or what constitutes bad sex, but they all have to be able to talk respectfully to one another about sex, sexuality, gender, power,” Johnson said.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, an outspoken campus conservative and critic of what he sees as Harvard’s “hookup culture,” expressed doubts, however, that such a  course—or any course on what he sees as a profoundly intimate topic—would be “intellectually compelling.”
“Sounds like an unserious course that would either descend to ignorant argumentation or, more likely, reflect a monolithic [politically correct] point of view,” Mansfield said. He added, though, that he hoped any such course would consider a broad range of scientific and literary sources on sex, examining in particular the contrasting viewpoints of men and women.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is requiring that many favorite local eateries leave the Smith Campus center as construction begins in earnest next week.
Au Bon Pain and Clover Food Labs close their current locations on Thursday, b. Good closed Tuesday, and Oggi has already move to a new location.
Some of those restaurants, the names and staples of the Harvard experience for students, face uncertain futures in the Square after they leave the campus center by early April.
 In their place, impending renovations for the Campus Center—which will span three floors and feature a network of meeting rooms and common spaces—will begin in the coming days and last until the Center’s opening in 2018, according to Harvard Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
University planners told business last year they must vacate their current spaces by the spring. Clover CEO Ayr Muir said he first learned about “getting kicked out” last April and that Harvard asked him to not talk about the forced move.
“Normally we are very transparent about what we do, but Harvard had asked us not to talk about getting kicked out,” Muir said. “We were very quiet.”
O’Rourke declined to comment on the impending departures and individual dealings with businesses.
Many of the establishments, such as Clover and Oggi, have already secured new storefronts in the Square, but other companies like Au Bon Pain, Al’s, and b.good are still on the hunt. The University has not indicated whether restaurants will be able to move back to the Smith Center after construction finishes.
Popular restaurant b.good has been searching for over a year and hopes to acquire a new space in Harvard Square in the next couple of months, according to the company's CEO Anthony Ackil ’99. Ackil said he was told b.good must leave the campus center by March 30, and that finding new real estate has been a difficult process.
“Harvard Square is really tight right now,” Ackil said. “The rents are crazy and there are not a lot of openings for small companies like us.”
Even for some businesses that have been able to successfully relocate, the process has been fraught. Muir said Harvard gave him a  narrow timeline to make the move. Clover’s last day in its present location is this Thursday, and by Friday, Muir said he plans to open the eatery’s new Massachusetts Ave. location.
“We asked Harvard for a couple more days, but they didn’t give it to us,” Muir said. “So we really have to get it done on time because you can’t have hourly employees be out of work for a few days. We needed to consider people’s jobs too.”
O’Rourke declined to comment on the University's interactions with Clover restaurant. 
Closing restaurants hosted celebrations in their final days and offered special deals to loyal customers. B.Good had customers pay what they wished on its final day in the Square on Tuesday and donated the proceeds to charity.
The restaurants are leaving just as the construction gets underway. Fences will surround the Smith Center with rotating entrances beginning Monday, and planners will make intermittent changes to the entrances and exits, as well as some temporary sidewalk and street closures for the duration of construction, according to O’Rourke.
Despite the changes and construction work, the Campus Center and many of the Harvard offices it houses, including Harvard University Health Services Urgent Care, will remain open throughout the entire renovation process.
Renovations to the Campus Center, announced in 2013, will continue in phases until the fall of 2018, when the building is currently scheduled to fully reopen.
“Many offices within the building will remain open throughout the duration of the project, and employees of these offices will continue to have access to the building,” O’Rourke wrote.  “Harvard will coordinate all closures with the City and will proactively communicate any updates to interested parties via its website, email notification lists, on-site signage and project boards.”
Administrators will post weekly construction updates on Harvard’s Construction Mitigation website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in her three-year career, junior saber fencer Adrienne Jarocki finished her season with a win at the NCAA Individual Championships. She took home the title after a hard-fought 15-10 victory over Ivy League rival Princeton’s Gracie Stone in Waltham, Mass.
“It feels wonderful,” Jarocki told a reporter immediately following the win as the ESPN camera rolled.  “Words can’t really describe it. I think that not winning my sophomore year actually makes this win so much sweeter because I was able to overcome that—put it in the past—and do it again.”
Halfway across the world, the Crimson’s Eli Dershwitz—who is currently on a gap year to pursue fencing at a higher level—completed his goal of qualifying for the US Olympic Team by winning the Seoul Grand Prix on Saturday, which put him in the top 14 of the FIE Adjusted Official Ranking List. The Sherborn, Mass., native is set to become the seventh Harvard fencer to compete for America on the international Olympic stage.
While future tournaments await Dershwitz to determine Olympic seeding, the 2016 Rio Olympics are now on his official calendar in early August.
Back on the collegiate circuit, after defeating fourth-seeded UC San Diego fencer Leanne Singleton-Comfort by a 15-9 score in the NCAA individual saber semifinals, Jarocki faced second-seeded Stone. The Harvard junior had defeated Stone once before at the same event—a 5-1 pool play victory.
Similar to the pool play bout, Adrienne jumped to quick start with a 4-1 lead. But Stone mounted a quick rebuttal to briefly take a 6-5 lead. Along the way, both athletes questioned the leading director multiple times, sending him behind the table to look at the replay monitor.
Coming out of the one-minute break, Jarocki notched with a quick touch and to take a 9-6 lead. The next action resulted in what was momentarily a touch for her to go up 10-6, but a replay initiated by Stone reversed the call, resulting in a 9-7 score instead.
Stone grabbed the the momentum briefly, scoring the next two touches as well to knot the score at nine. But with Stone advancing down the strip, Jarocki used her length to score a touch while retreating to stop the run and regain the lead. Stone then responded bytaking the next touch for a 10-10 tie.
After multiple simultaneous attacks, Jarocki scored the next four touches, with Stone was visibly frustrated with herself. Now it was 14-10, Jarocki.
Two straight simultaneous attacks delayed the final result, but Jarocki advanced down the strip with a quick burst of footwork after the next en garde. Though her first attack fell short, her redouble connected with Stone’s lame, and Jarocki’s momentum carried her past her opponent and into the top spot of the championships after reaching the final four last year but unable to defend her freshman year title.
“[Adrienne] was very disappointed last year to get upset,” men’s co-captain Michael Woo said. “But Adrienne is super determined—she’s a hard worker and a great teammate, so I was really proud for her because she’s put in so much effort.”
The two-day event began with pool play, and Jarocki marched her way to a number one seeding after going 19-4 with a plus-56 indicator. But the final four still loomed, with two 15-touch bouts standing between her and a second individual title.
Other Crimson women in the saber event included senior Aliya Itzkowitz, who had lost to Jarocki at the 2014 edition of the NCAA Championships. But this time, Itzkowitz’s 10-13 record in pool play and improvement from 23rd to 15th place was not enough for her to advance to the final four. In total, the saber squas amassed 29 points.
In epee, freshman Shawn Wallace rode a 13-10 record to a ninth-place finish in her tournament debut, while fellow freshman Sharon Ra finished 23rd in her first appearance. The foil bracket saw sophomore MacKenzie Lawrence finish in 14th, and freshman Liana Henderson-Semel in 22nd.The epee fencers earned 18 points, while foil finished with 14.
On the men’s side, three Harvard fencers finished in the top 15, with foil fencers leading the way. Junior Stephen Mageras and Woo finished seventh and eighth, respectively, after both finished with a 14-9 bout record. Their performances earned them All-American designations—Woo’s third and Mageras’ first in the latter’s first NCAA Individual Championships appearance.
“I was really proud of Stephen,” Woo said. “Coming to the NCAAs for the first time is pretty difficult, and he did a good job staying calm under pressure and for such a long tournament, really grinding it out.”
Senior Alexander Ryjik, competing in his fourth individual championships, finished 14th with an 11-12 record.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jimmy Vesey, the outgoing star of the Harvard men’s hockey team, will reportedly test the National Hockey League’s unrestricted free agency period in August rather than sign immediately with the Nashville Predators.
Vesey’s representatives informed the Predators of the senior’s decision, first reported by TSN’s Bob McKenzie, on Monday. Nashville drafted Vesey in the third round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, 66th overall.
For the second consecutive year, Vesey had the option to sign and play with the Predators immediately after the Crimson’s season came to an end in the NCAA tournament. A year ago, however, Vesey elected to return to school for his senior season, and at least for now, he has declined the opportunity to join the team that drafted him once again.
Nashville General Manager David Poile held an impromptu press conference in the middle of the Predators’ home game with the Colorado Avalanche on Monday night to address Vesey’s decision.
“Very disappointing news obviously for the Nashville Predators, our fans, and our team,” Poile said.
After registering just 40 points over his first two seasons with the Crimson, Vesey exploded for 104 over the course of his junior and senior seasons, finishing as the nation’s leading goal scorer (32) in 2014-2015.
Vesey has also won back-to-back Walter Brown awards as the top American-born Division I hockey player in New England. He will find out Thursday if he has been named a top-three finalist for the Hobey Baker award as college hockey’s Most Valuable Player for the second year in a row.
Vesey’s decision came as a surprise to Poile, who said Vesey told Nashville Assistant General Manager Paul Fenton prior to the NHL trade deadline (Feb. 29) that he would be signing with the Predators. Poile also said he had not been told that Vesey was considering testing free agency until Wednesday when the organization received a call from Vesey’s camp.
“Up until a week ago Wednesday, I thought for sure we were going to sign Jimmy Vesey,” Poile said. “So this is a shocker.”
Vesey, however, sounded less definitive about signing with Nashville in an interview with TSN’s The Pipeline Show back in January.
"I have a great relationship with the Predators," Vesey said on Jan. 26. "They've worked pretty extensively with me over the four years since I've been drafted. They're at a lot of my games and have given a lot of feedback. So I have a great relationship with them and the organization, but right now I'm focusing on Harvard. Once my season ends, I'll kind of sit back and see if the Predators are the right fit."
Vesey could not be reached for comment Monday night.
Per the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement, Nashville maintains “the exclusive rights of negotiation” for Vesey’s services through Aug. 15. And Poile said he has not given up hope on signing the senior prior to the deadline.
“Our relationship with Jimmy Vesey has been excellent for almost four years,” Poile said. “We have been a big part of his development, we’ve invested a lot of time, our relationship is good. The fit and opportunity remains very good here for him in Nashville, and I’m going to continue to try and see whether we can persuade him to change his mind.”
If Vesey remains unsigned after Aug. 15, the ex-Harvard captain can then begin negotiating with the other 29 teams in the league.

When Yenching shut down, we shed a couple of tears. When Panera closed suddenly, it felt like we lost a very close friend. But now that Au Bon Pain is closing down, I think we have gone numb.
Yes, Au Bon Pain is leaving the Square like many of our other beloved restaurants and establishments. It was to be expected due to the renovation of the Smith Campus Center, but it just happened so fast. It was just yesterday (not actually) that they were giving away free coffee, which is great when you tire of the standard dining hall fare.
It is even weirder when you realize that it has been in the Square for 32 years. You know how old 32 years is? This is before Radcliffe College fully integrated with Harvard University. The Olympics were held in Los Angeles and Ronald Reagan was president. And now, it will be gone.
If one really can't live with it, technically there is one located near Zinneken’s and another near the Charles. But neither are as easily accessible as the Harvard Square one and they close earlier than the 1 am time for which the Square establishment is known. It seems like all the national fast food cafés are disappearing. All of them.
You still have time to say your final farewell. The last day you can get a sandwich there is on March 31st. That might give you enough time to prepare to have Starbucks as our coffee/cafe overlords.
