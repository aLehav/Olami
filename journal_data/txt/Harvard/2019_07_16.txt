After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This review contains spoilers for the sixth episode of “Big Little Lies” Season Two. 
Forget “Kramer vs. Kramer”: The spiciest on-screen courtroom showdown is shaping up to be Kidman vs. Streep. In the penultimate episode of “Big Little Lies”’ second season, Celeste (Nicole Kidman) and Mary Louise (Meryl Streep) go head-to-head in a guardianship battle that exposes the most compromising sides of the former’s life, at the malicious behest of the latter. And all in front of Elle Woods herself!
But in “Big Little Lies,” it appears that the only thing being bent and snapped is the Monterey Five’s collective sanity. “It’s getting you to, isn’t it?” Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz) says knowingly to Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) in the hallways of the courtroom, before Celeste’s big trial. “It” — the lie, their guilt, their fraying allyship — is “getting to” everyone, most of all Celeste, whose fateful verdict rests in her courtroom demeanor. Her lawyer Katie (Poorna Jagannathan) has reminded her for two consecutive episodes that it’s imperative she remains neutral and not “erratic,” as Mary Louise’s lawyer is desperate to prove. (Somehow this is the only piece of advice Katie can give, after which she abandons her line of questioning after a single question! And then lets the judge take over entirely! Very cool lawyer Celeste has hired here.)
The women’s oath to protect each other has already begun to unravel, especially as the impending custody case has tested the limits of their allegiance to each other and to the lie that binds them. Their ad hoc friendship is not much more than a tenuous allyship, as Madeline lashes out at Bonnie during yet another emergency midnight beachside meeting. Yet, if not bosom friends, they must remain at least willing collaborators, given that the custody case (and, ahem, homicide case) literally depends on their ability to stay consistent: “With five witnesses, the odds are in her favor that one of you will finally crack. The first one who does, gets a break. The other four are fucked,” Corey (Douglas Smith) — who is only sort of a police informant! — explains Detective Quinlan’s strategy to Jane (Shailene Woodley).
Who will be the first to crack? Will it be Madeline, intent on using total transparency to repair her unstable marriage to Ed (Adam Scott), who contemplates cheating with Tori Bachman (Sarah Sokolovic), the wife of Madeline’s lover? Or perhaps Celeste, under duress at the witness stand? No, the likeliest informant is Bonnie, who’s already made several furtive trips to the police station out of guilt and moral duty. In this episode, she even pens a dark, introspective confession, admitting that she pushed Perry Wright partially out of resentment for her abusive mother. Elizabeth’s (Crystal Fox) violence has tinged every part of Bonnie’s life with trauma, from the way she sought out sex at an early age, to her settling for a husband she does not… (Here she trails off, but we get it: Nathan is a hard guy to love.) Bonnie’s monologue is a bit of needed development, for a laconic supporting character who has, up to now, preferred to linger in the background — albeit a character arc that disappointingly tends to rely on black stereotypes of abusive mothers and mystical powers. 
While Bonnie delivers her rousing (dare I say, Emmy-worthy?) monologue to her comatose mother, Celeste faces suspicion at the witness stand, where Mary Louise’s lawyer attempts to weaponize her supposedly erratic behavior against her. In fact, he points out while clicking through damning slides, that swarthy tattooed bartender was not the only one of Celeste’s one-night escapades; there was Michael something, Brad from that one time, Bobby in that bathroom stall… The story gets complicated.
Except: Does it? Certainly a woman’s sexual life is not a relevant indicator of her parenting capability, beyond the lawyer’s need to slut-shame a woman for being an active agent of her own desire. Desire and motherhood are incompatible, his case insists. Good mothers are by nature unsexual beings! Mary Louise, nodding along in her cardigan and crucifix necklace, surely endorses the case. And for the show that swept the Golden Globes in the midst of black dresses and Time’s Up pins, it is no coincidence that its courtroom drama sequence would follow more or less the same lines of questioning as a sexual assault case. Was the sex that followed abuse ever gratifying, pleasurable? Why didn’t she ever go to the police? Why didn’t she tell anyone, until now? An undeniably upsetting interrogation is mired in victim-blaming, eliciting an all-too-familiar frustration at a court’s inability to put credence in a woman’s experience.
Here, the episode falls prey to a moral simplicity that undercuts the complexity and stakes absent from the season at large. Season One embraced an unwillingness to conform to easy moral dualisms of good and bad, to embrace the “irreducible ambiguities” (in Joan Didion’s words) of fiction. The courtroom drama unfolding in Season Two gives you the sense that “Big Little Lies” is perhaps worthy commentary, but unscintillating art.
Until Celeste turns the tables. To invoke an earlier Kidman-Streep collaboration, Mrs. Wright decided she would question the witness herself! With considerable legal expertise at hand, Celeste demands (against the advice of her lawyer and judge) to personally lead the examination of her mother-in-law. The next and last episode will likely reveal exactly what happened to Perry’s younger brother, whose untimely death was alluded to earlier this season. But most of all, it’ll provide the Celeste-as-a-lawyer content the show has promised from that phenomenal “Avenue Q” free speech defense in Season One. Here, head writer David E. Kelley has laid the groundwork for a shattering season finale, if not one that sees Kelley (the creator of legal dramas like “Ally McBeal” and “The Practice,” among many others) retreating into familiar territory.
Ordinarily, that would be all. End of recap. But it would be negligent to omit the controversy that has overshadowed this week’s episode. After critics have observed a certain disjointed editing quality all season, IndieWire reported earlier this week in a sourced article that director Andrea Arnold “lost creative control” after Season One director Jean-Marc Vallée returned somewhat unexpectedly to the show, imposing an aesthetic vision more closely hewn from the first season under his direction. It is the great irony of ironies that, in a show touted for its commitment to female art — featuring a roster of accomplished actresses, two of whom are credited as executive producers — male creatives would sideline a skilled female director. If true, that post-production dynamic would be a great disrespect to Arnold, whose immense and affecting filmography includes the likes of “American Honey” and “Fish Tank” — not to mention, a compromise in television quality, a great concession to banality. Fiction is laden with irreducible ambiguities. What’s the verdict on real life?

If you’re concerned about gerrymandering, the last few weeks have been painful. But instead of stewing over the Supreme Court’s disappointing decision in the North Carolina gerrymandering case or the Trump Administration’s attempts to interfere with the next census, I’ve tried to hold on to one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s favorite lines: “We don’t agonize, we organize.”
In Congress, this organizing has already begun. Under Pelosi’s gavel, the new Democratic majority opened this legislative session with a flourish, reserving the prime designation of House Resolution 1 for a sweeping package of reforms to voting rights, campaign finance, and government ethics policies. Nestled in the 571-page bill is the little-noticed Redistricting Reform Act of 2019, Congress’ radical push to fix gerrymandering.
H.R. 1 calls for brand new, nonpartisan, redistricting commissions in every state in the country, as opposed to the more traditional process of having state legislatures draw maps. The bill is a tremendous step, in that it represents Congress acknowledging that partisan gerrymandering needs a legislative fix.
But while H.R. 1 should be celebrated as an expansive statement of values, the solution it proposes is premature. The legislative text delves into the nitty gritty: how many people should be selected for each commission (five Democrats, five Republicans, and five independents), how commissioners should be selected (it’s complicated), what would happen if the commission fails to agree on a map (“Order in the court!”), and even what belongs on the commissions’ websites (really?).
Here’s the problem: it’s not clear where these specifics came from. With only eight states currently using (quite varied) redistricting commissions, there is no way to justify the bill’s details as being grounded in best practices. What is the rationale for having 15 commissioners, when, under current law, California favors 14, Michigan 13, and Idaho only six?
I appreciate Congress’ urgency in taking action before the next redistricting cycle in 2022. But before adopting unproven rules as a national standard, we should pump the brakes and prepare a rigorous fact-finding mission. While the Senate refuses to debate election reform, the House has time to go back to the drawing board and get gerrymandering right. That process should begin with hearings, research grants, and commissions to develop best practices.
Gerrymandering is an existential threat to free and fair elections. If the details of our solution are wrong, we risk losing the entire enterprise of reform. Worse, we might exacerbate the problem by entrenching practices that result in lopsided districts before naively calling it a day.
Some questions will be answered by academics. Some already have. Before Congress chooses national criteria, we need to know how maps are affected by different values, like Voting Rights Act compliance, district compactness, or political competitiveness, and how these values interact. Also: where’s the game theoretician who can tell me the optimal number of commissioners?
Other questions will be answered by the various commissions already in service. Should Congress mandate equal splits in party affiliation? Do independent commissioners truly vote independently, or will nonpartisan quotas be filled with libertarians who might favor the Republican Party? Will the partisan affiliation of potential commissioners be a meaningful distinction in a world where younger voters shun political parties?
After watching state level fixes fall sadly short, I tend to agree that we need Congress’ help. Just ask the well-meaning voters who endorsed redistricting commissions by ballot initiative in four states in 2018. In Utah, the measure is simply window dressing — a loophole will allow the legislature to completely circumvent the new commission and continue its old process. In Missouri, the reform package instructed commissioners to draw hexagonal districts, a legislative detail that left political scientists scratching their heads. (This might explain why the authors of H.R. 1 left no room for states to keep existing commissions, though the choice may upset constituents in California.)
Even if Congress comes up with a perfect bill, advocates for reform must recognize that standardization comes with risks. Just as the decentralization of the American voting system offers protection from meddling, the great variability in local political conditions protects our institutions from coordinated influence.
For example, the Heritage Foundation has already made it clear in congressional testimony that conservatives will challenge the constitutionality of H.R. 1. If every commission in the country operates under the same legislative text, one successful challenge in court may shutter mapping operations nationwide and shunt us back to the gerrymandered present.
Now that the Supreme Court has abdicated its responsibility to curtail partisan gerrymandering, Congress is on the hook for coming up with a solution. I’m unabashedly thrilled about H.R. 1. But the devil is in the details, and for something sacrosanct like the integrity of our elections, the American people deserve nuanced policy based on transparent and rigorous study.

PARIS, FRANCE — “J’adore Megan Rah-pi-nohh.”
The bartender draws out the last syllable of the American soccer star’s last name in a way that’s become familiar after weeks of watching World Cup broadcasts en français. She finishes assembling our nachos and I hand her my debit card.
“Je pense que je vais teindre mes cheveux en roses.” (I think I’m going to dye my hair pink.)
I tell her she should go for it and head back to my table. Over the past two weeks, a few of my summer school classmates and I have watched every one of the American team’s games in the World Cup. Unable to locate a Dutch restaurant in Paris, we’ve settled for an Australian pub to watch the final match against les Pays-Bas.
I am hardly a soccer player — during my short career on the soccer team in second grade I designated myself cheerleader and spent most of the time choreographing dance routines — but I’ve loved watching this World Cup. The American team is unbelievably talented and has kept every game exciting in the knockout rounds. You know they’re going to win, kind of, but you can’t be sure until the final whistle.
It’s been interesting to see what this team means abroad. Back home, the American players have become veritable superstars: symbols of the fight for gender equality and a beacon of hope for an ever-divided nation.
But these days, nothing escapes the pull of partisan politics, including soccer. European newspapers tried to diminish the U.S. team, decrying their celebration of hard-fought success on the field and minimizing the significance of their straightforward demand to be paid equally to the men’s soccer team for equal work and greater glory. Meanwhile, the U.S. papers take the winning for granted but carp over the team’s activism and political stances.
The American team crushed France’s hopes of a World Cup victory in the quarterfinals, but all is forgiven by the time Rose Lavelle secures a victory in the second half of the final game. The bar erupts, and someone grabs an American flag hanging on the wall, waving it triumphantly in the air.
While the French may envy the success of the women’s team, they seem to remain skeptical about our domestic battles. My seatmate on a weekend train ride asks me why the U.S. wants to build a wall. Ma mère d’accueil watches a documentary on the violence in Charlottesville, broadcast on French TV on a humid July night, and asks me if this kind of thing happens often in America.
Nobody knows quite what to make of it all. But everyone can get behind a good soccer game.
