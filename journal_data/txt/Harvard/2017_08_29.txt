After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is an important —and increasingly urgent—question surrounding Arab-Israeli dialogue: Who can claim “indigenous” status in the Levantine region?
Opinion pieces, including two in these pages this summer, have made important contributions to both sides of the debate. Both those who would indict the apartheid regime and those who would caution against hastily assessing Israeli self-defense tactics, which help to thwart Hamas, are deeply relevant. Yet nevertheless, the issue of “indigenous” status remains.
To many spectators (particularly on the far left), the question is a settled one. In a recent op-ed for Al Jazeera, one commentator referred to the Jews who fled Europe for Israel after the Holocaust as “colonizers and conquerors,” contrasting Arab indigeneity with Jewish foreignness. The same piece charged “Wonder Woman” lead actress Gal Gadot with faking Jewish identity after her parents made aliyah: “Like most Zionists, her parents changed their names from Greenstein to ‘indigenize’ themselves, but that does not change who they are.” To this author, Gadot and her cohort of Israeli Jews are no different from white European imperialists, overseeing the “destruction of the indigenous society.”
Other voices have started to echo this position. This month, the Democratic Socialists of America voted to boycott Israel over “apartheid, colonialism [and] military occupation.” Beneath the doctrinal language lies the same colonial charge: Israeli Jews are the new conquistadores. And this sentiment is far from isolated.
Certain things ought to go without saying. Current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a war hawk on the settlements issue. He has been a consistent proponent of settlement construction in the West Bank and has occasionally dismissed the possibility of a Palestinian state. Israel’s large military presence in the West Bank is also troubling, as it occasionally enables abusive force. Few political moderates would defend these incursions. For its part, the United States—generally regarded as Israel’s closest ally—has expressed its concerns. But it does not follow from either Netanyahu’s politics or his aggressive interpretation of borders that Israel is inherently colonial.
Sociological and genetic research has long shown that a recognizable Jewish nation first emerged in the Levantine region some 4,000 years ago. This population cultivated the area of Canaan—modern-day Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon—eventually organizing into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Yihudah (Judah) in the south.
After a colonization campaign by the Romans, this region was reorganized into the province of Judea, where the Hebrews suffered ethnoreligious persecution. Eventually, the empire stripped the region of this name—which at least acknowledged the thousands-year-old subordinate culture—and assigned it a new colonial one: Syria Palaestina. The new name “Palestine,” according to former Harvard Professor H. H. Ben-Sasson, was an attempt to destroy the connection between the Jews and their homeland.
Modern opponents of Israel echo this tactic through the familiar apartheid analogy, which delegitimizes the Jewish presence in the Levant by likening it to the Anglo-Dutch presence in South Africa. This narrative tries to render Jewishness inseparable from the logic of the settlements. Again, these efforts belie history.
When the Dutch and English empires arrived in South Africa, they set foot on a continent that their ancestors had abandoned shortly after the dawn of humanity. In planting the seeds of a new society, they displaced the region’s historical inhabitants. The settlers had no grounds for settlement, no cause for war, and no knowledge of or affinity for the territory. They arrived, to borrow a phrase, as “colonizers and conquerors,” establishing a government permissive of discrimination and, on certain occasions, eugenic social engineering.
The Jewish arrival in Palestine, meanwhile, was an act of return. Decades before the Balfour Declaration signaled the prospect of a Jewish state, Jews tired of systematic persecution in Europe and the Arabian Peninsula began to migrate back to the Levant. None who made the first aliyah intended to remove the region’s new inhabitants. Local residential evictions only began after a series of violent protests across the Middle East signaled sectarian discomfort with the growing Jewish population (including the Farhud, the 1936 Arab Revolt, and the Libyan Riots).
The global historical circumstances of the period shed further light on the early aliyahs.  In 1924, the United States adopted the Immigration Act—known commonly as the Asian Exclusion Act. Contrary to popular understanding, though, the act also curtailed Jewish immigration, leaving Europe’s Ashkenazim with few immigration options besides Palestine. Meanwhile, persecution outside Europe—most notably in Yemen—prompted Mizrahi (Middle Eastern Jews) to flow to Palestine as well.
A more detailed history of the Jewish diaspora is too long to provide here, but the point is short: Jews have as much claim to the Levantine region as Arabs. To speak of the Jewish diaspora as though those people have always been splattered across the Earth is to deny their cohesive origin and the violent act through which they were divided. It also ignores the precarious position in which the diaspora finds itself currently, with anti-Semitism rising in Europe and the Middle East and with neo-Nazis marching at the University of Virginia.
It is necessary in a healthy democratic culture to disagree over politics, but someone’s history and humanity are quite another matter. To equate Israel with its settlements is not only lackadaisical, historically speaking; it is revisionist. The Jewish ethnic identity was forged by thousands of years of cultural self-defense deeply bound up with the territory of modern-day Israel, and any resolution—by the DSA, the City University of New York, or others—that negates that bond is either misinformed or willfully forgetful.
In short, either the Levant belongs to both parties—Jewish and Arab—or it belongs to neither.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is part one in a series of op-eds by members of Harvard student groups welcoming the Class of 2021 to campus.
Dear Freshmen:
Arriving on campus as a first year student, you will experience a myriad of changes as you transition to life at Harvard. This may be the first time that you can focus on receiving your education instead of helping to pay the bills. This may be the first time that you will have access to quality health care. This may be the first time you physically feel safer from possibilities of deportation. If you are undocumented, DACAmented, part of a mixed-status family, or another immigrant identity negatively affected by the current immigration system, this letter is for you.
On Nov. 8, 2016, members and friends of Act on a Dream gathered in a common room to watch what we expected to be an easy win. We prepared to celebrate the loss of the presidential candidate who had been bringing fear to our community for far too long. We prepared to see the hateful rhetoric end once and for all. Little did we know it was only the beginning.
Hours later, the light from the TV screen reflected on our members’ faces, illuminating the tears rolling down their cheeks. Intermittent silence filled the room—interrupted only by the faint sounds of sobbing and tissues being ripped out of boxes.
We thought about our families. We wondered what would happen to our parents in a country that saw them as criminals.
We thought about ourselves. What would this mean for our education and our possibilities to study abroad? Would we be able to work after getting our degrees from Harvard? Would we even be able to graduate? What would become of our lives under the Trump administration?
This election made it clear. We didn’t have many people on our side. A huge portion of the country was against us. But we did have each other. We needed time to heal, but we also needed to be provided with support in a time of increased vulnerability. We needed to make sure that we, along with future generations, would feel safe at Harvard.
For many undocu+ students, their stake in immigration policies has been a source of empowerment. Alongside others in the community, many develop their undocumented identity and reclaim the power that continues to be taken away by politics. After the election, members of Act on a Dream organized to meet with University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and countless other administrators to establish support structures. Members of Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard organized rallies to fight for a sanctuary campus. Campus organizing, among other forms of activism, has been the soil for the flourishing array of administrative support.
However, the majority of undocu+ students also grow at Harvard without ever being involved in campus organizing. Whether it is focusing on becoming a leader in their career field or spending time in various extracurricular interests, many undocu+ students thrive at Harvard without ever disclosing their legal status to others or involving themselves in the political issue. These members of the community are equally loved and valued.
While we, the authors of this article, are both DACAmented, we recognize that we can’t speak for all members of the Undocu+ community. Nevertheless, we welcome all students interested in getting involved. In the current times, existing as an individual affected by immigration policies is already a form of activism.
Navigating Harvard is hard enough as a first year student. Many undocu+ students still deal with fear of deportation, limited study abroad and work opportunities, mental health concerns, and an uncertain future that adds an even more complex layer to your freshman experience. You will have questions on how to navigate this system as an undocumented college student that not everyone will be able to answer.
Although you’ve been waiting to move in since the moment you received your acceptance notice—maybe even longer—it’s not easy to start this new chapter in your life. As an Undocu+ student, you can find support through Act on a Dream. People have found a home through support groups, community dinners, canvassing events, demonstrations, and more. Students can be assured to receive support through compassionate individuals in Harvard’s administrative bodies.
You can find central help through Katie Derzon, the Fellow for Undocumented Students, and Camila Nardozzi, the Director of the Office of International Education. Many students have received legal help from Jason Corral, the full time attorney for undocumented/DACA students. Training a multitude of staff, connecting with individual students, and implementing solutions through the Undocumented Student Working Group, the administration has showed their dedication to our community. However, these structures are a product of daily organizing by undocu+ students.
We are no longer gathering in fear as we were that night in the common room. We are gathering with pride for the work that has been done and with hope for the change that is yet to come. We are so excited to welcome you to our community as we continue  improving the community for all, regardless of citizenship status.
Love,
Your Undocu-family, Act on a Dream

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Living in a small neighborhood in the outskirts of Yokohama, called Tsurumi, was a surreal experience. Tsurumi was simultaneously more urban than Boston—what with its incredible public transportation and myriads of stores, local bars, and ramen stands—and yet peaceful enough to be unnervingly quiet at times.
What I loved most about Tsurumi, though, were the cats that often roamed the streets. Many an evening, I would find myself wandering back to my apartment from the laboratory through a lovely forested path only to encounter strays—cared for by many residents of Tsurumi’s homes. A typical Tsurumi cat sports a shiny coat and well-fed demeanor.
Elsewhere in Japan, I met countless deer. Nara, one of the most important cities in the history of Japanese Buddhism, sparkles with its dazzling bronze Daibutsu statue, towering Todai-ji temple, and hills of endless shrines. In every corner of these sacred sites, large-eyed does with their small fawns and bucks with impressive antlers roam looking for the best bushes to eat and the odd snack from a tourist. (Beware, though, the aggressive adolescent deer who will eat cookies right out of your hand and then express its displeasure when the cookies run out by eating your clothes!)
In the Arashiyama District of Kyoto, monkeys run free on a mountain slope, within the Iwatayama Park. Here, baby monkeys learn to be comfortable with humans, and monkey youth snarl at koi in a pond. With their rippling gray hairs and vividly pink faces, they make for spectacular inhabitants in this park overlooking such a breathtaking view of the city of Kyoto.
Japan is a country lauded internationally for its urban good-looks, striking cultural trends, and millennium of history. Seeing the beauty of the country dotted with the curious sight of these animals was an unexpected surprise which enriched my summer stay in Japan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As President Donald Trump considers ending a program that allows some undocumented students to legally live in the United States, University President Drew G. Faust implored him in a letter Monday to preserve it.
Established by former President Barack Obama in 2012, DACA provides temporary protections to qualifying undocumented youth. It enables hundreds of thousands of young people across the country to work and study without fear of deportation—including around 65 at Harvard this year, according to Katie M. Derzon, the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion’s fellow for undocumented students.
“I write to express my deep concern about reports that the Administration is considering whether to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and to urge you to continue it as it currently exists,” Faust wrote. “I also urge your Administration to vigorously defend DACA in the federal courts should its validity come under challenge.”
But DACA stands on shaky ground under Trump, who pledged to crack down on illegal immigration during his campaign. The Trump administration extended the program in June, to the relief of Harvard’s undocumented students. In recent days, however, reports have indicated that Trump is once again mulling DACA’s future, under pressure from 10 states that have threatened to sue the federal government if it doesn’t put a stop to the program by Sept. 5. Options on the table include doing away with DACA entirely or putting in place a watered-down version of the program, according to a CNN report.
Amid the uncertainty, Faust—a longtime advocate for undocumented students—emphasized the positive contributions undocumented students make to American universities in her letter Monday.
“We, as a nation, have already made an investment in these young people, and we will benefit far more by permitting these students to put their skills to their highest use rather than by repealing DACA and forcing them to return to the shadows of our society,” she wrote.
This letter is the second Faust has sent to Trump about DACA; she and more than 100 college and university presidents co-signed a statement in support of the program to Trump last November.
Since the election, the University has augmented resources and defenses for undocumented students. Harvard hired an attorney in its Immigration and Refugee Law Clinic to provide legal counsel, convened immigration law experts at campus seminars, and launched a website listing resources for undocumented students, among other measures. The Harvard University Police Department also sent a letter to students in November indicating it would not inquire about affiliates’ immigration status or help enforce federal immigration laws.
The instability of the program since Trump’s election has generated anxiety among Harvard’s undocumented population, according to Daishi M. Tanaka ’19, an undocumented student who co-directs the advocacy group Act on a Dream.
“All this uncertainty about the future keeps me and my friends in the community from being able to sort of live a normal student lifestyle,” he said.
Paulo J. Pinto ’18, a DACA recipient, said losing the legal protections DACA provides will jeopardize the ability of undocumented students to work on campus and obtain post-graduate jobs.
“It will be demoralizing for a lot of people who have basically grown up with DACA,” he said. “I think over the past four or so years, there’s been a sense of slight relief, and you kind of take a lot of things for granted, like being able to work on campus without going through a lot of loopholes to get paid.”
Tanaka praised administrators for their “proactive” efforts—including Faust’s letter to Trump—but criticized Faust’s reluctance to call Harvard a sanctuary campus.
Faust declined to do so in December, citing concerns that labeling Harvard a sanctuary would draw unwanted attention from federal authorities and endanger University’s undocumented population.
Both Tanaka and Pinto said they hope that if Trump does put a halt to the DACA program, Faust and other administrators will ramp up protections for undocumented students.
“The students are looking to the administration for support,” Tanaka said.

For the uninitiated, the Q Guide is the best marker for figuring out how amazing or how trash a class is. Here’s a collection of some of the most savage Q-Guide comments from last fall. Use them wisely.
Our commentary in italics.
STAT 104: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics
“I don't know why this course is called "Frat 104" because it's actually hard.”
“Parzen is the ultimate homie.”
“pets r long  (this person was prob high)”
“h8”
“na” Two characters say it all.
CULTBLF 23: From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism, From the Old Testament to Christianity
(This class is notorious for being easy af)
“The Hope Diamond...ever heard of it?????? Take this class”
“You know why you're taking this.”
“This is a great class to take if you just want to chill.”
SOCIOL 186: Refugees in Global Perspective
“I am recommending this class entirely for Danilo Mandic.  (Prof. Mandic is also just really good looking, so you'll always actually be paying attention to him.”
AESTHINT 56: Shakespeare, The Later Plays
“Shakespeare is still full of sexist bullshit, but this course itself is good”
“Don't pay too much attention to the footnotes in the books - it's terribly time-consuming, they are often unnecessary, and they often disrupt the flow of the more lyrical passages” Most of the comments on this class are just explaining who Shakespeare is, which is great I guess, but do these people know what the Q is for?
AESTHINT 53: Anime as Global Popular Culture
“You get to watch anime.” ‘Nuff said. 
FOLKMYTH 172: Quilts and Quiltmaking
“Don't fear if you've never touched a needle in your life.” Never knew someone could use such a hyperbolic, dramatic statement to introduce a class on damn quilts.
“I left this class with no regrets, having learned far more than I had ever thought possible.” Can we get “No Ragrets” sewn on a quilt?
“I learned a new skill which is so useful (hello never having to ask my mom to sew buttons again!!), made so many new friends (quilting in the dining hall is like bringing in a new toy to pre-school, everyone wants to try it out!), and I made a final project that I actually feel like I want to show off!”
“Professor Lufkin is the greatest! She is able to lead an incredible discussion during seminar, and is able to host a tremendous "Stitch-N-B***h" during lab!” Stitch-n-bitch: the old lady version of a wine moms’ charceuterie-and-shittalk. 
This is the only class I’ve ever heard of with only positive reviews (besides a freshman seminar on Bob Dylan). Maybe we should all switch to folk and myth? Finally, a humanities concentration that teaches practical skills.
COMPSCI 50: Introduction to Computer Science I
“I have met some of my best friends in this class, and there is so much support to get you through the difficult times.” I would not be surprised if David J. Malan himself had written this review.
“Free time and CS50 are, in fact, mutually exclusive.”
“Don't take this pass-fail your senior fall, because you won't want to do any of the work, but you'll still have to do the work.” Who makes it to senior year still thinking CS50 might be a good time…sounds fake but okay.
“If you can learn programming on your own, go for it. www.codeacademy.com,” b*tches. 
“For graduate students taking this course as an elective, it should be noted that this course is very time-demanding.” If you’re a grad student taking CS50 for fun, congratulations, you have reached peak hardo. 
“Everyone should take this class” how about you eat my shorts
ECON 1010A: Intermediate Microeconomics
“Careful”
“This is easily the worst taught class at the college.” more than one comment said this….Yikes.
“The rumors are true!”
“I liked this a lot more than Ec 1010a/b” how did you like this more than 1010A, though?
“you have to take this!” Written by the Ec department?
“Interesting and challenging but not” The entire english department could not teach me how to read this sentence.
“Atudy [Sic]” Sage advice.
ECON 1126: Quantitative Methods in Economics
“This class was by FAR the worst class I've ever taken at Harvard. I've given a 1 on the Q before, and I now regret that because this class was so much worse than that one”
“Do not take this class. Take Stat 111. Transfer to Yale. Drop out. Do not take this class.” Say it with me: when it doubt, “Transfer to Yale. Drop Out.”
PHYSICS 15A: Introductory Mechanics and Relativity
“Special relativity is incredibly interesting/confusing but well worth the thought. Definitely forces you to problem solve.” Haha, get it? Forces, like the physics forces! 
ECON 1017: A Libertarian Perspective on Economic and Social Policy
“Not a gem. Its a trap! They grade super hard but there is no coursework.” “Not a gem. Its a trap!” -Indiana Jones
LIFESCI 1A: An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology
“Get it over with” The sort of thing one says after finding they have bad chemistry with chemistry...
“It is a solid introduction to biology/chemistry, but not life-changing.”
I get the feeling this person may have been misled as to the meaning of “life sciences.”
“If you're interested in biology, this class is pretty much unavoidable. If you're just looking for an easy Gen Ed, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.” ALL CAPS SO YOU KNOW I MEAN BUSINESS
STAT 110: Introduction to Probability
“Professor was good. Disliked it because probability is stupid b******* and most of what you learn is tricks instead of actual useful math” I mean, Math is mostly just magic and tricks to me so I can’t relate.
“be ready to battle!...” Blitzstein vs. 500 Harvard students is a movie I would watch.  At 2x speed.
“Stat110 (more commonly referred to as Frat110) does an excellent job of introducing the study of probability...” P(Frat 110 being a phrase anyone has ever used) = 0.
“FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU'RE A GENIUS OR SOMETHING OR IF YOU ARE SUPER DEDICATED TO STUDYING. THIS IS NOT FOR THE LAZYBUG LIKE ME.”
I AM SO LAZY I CAN’T BE BOTHERED TO TURN OFF MY CAPS LOCK. AHHHHHHH.
“It's no cakewalk”
Yeah, it’s more of a Random Walk. Lol. Math humor.
“Just don't”
If Nike sponsored this class.
