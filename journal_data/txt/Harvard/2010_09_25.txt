Who knew that having a national sports title could pay off so well?
On Wednesday, Sept. 22, some of Harvard’s very own national champions were honored at Fenway Park during the opening ceremonies of the final Red Sox–Orioles match up of the season.
Posing for pictures with Wally the mascot on the field, current and former Crimson athletes got the unique chance to see the park from a very different perspective.
First introduced was 2010 graduate J.P. O’Connor, winner of the 157-pound title at the 2010 NCAA Wrestling Championships. Now training for the 2012 London Olympics, O’Connor posted a perfect 35-0 record in his senior season at Harvard—a first in program history.
Next introduced was junior fencer Caroline Vloka. At the 2010 NCAA Championships she claimed the sabre title by defeating long-time rival Rebecca Ward of Duke. Coincidentally, the matchup was a repeat of the 2009 final, and Vloka’s victory made her only the second female in Crimson fencing history to claim a national title.
Following O’Connor and Vloka was a slew of Harvard squash athletes—Colin West ’10 and sophomore Laura Gemmell were accompanied by the entire women’s squash team.
West, who finished fifth this summer in the World University Squash Games in Sydney, captured the CSA individual national championship title in his senior season after amassing a 16-1 record. He capped off his impressive collegiate career by nabbing his fourth All-American award.
Gemmell had a stellar rookie season, going 16-0 en route to claiming her own CSA national individual title. She, like West, also competed in the World University Squash Games for Canada (she finished 13th) and garnered All-American honors.
The champion also helped her team finish its season 12-0, claiming its 17th Ancient Eight crown and 12th national title. The women beat Penn, 6-3, to claim victory at the CSA national championship.
The Fenway faithful may hope that the Crimson’s success rubbed off on the Sox. 7.5 games behind the Yankees going into Friday night’s game, everyone knows the Sox could certainly use a few tallies in the wins column.
Who better to teach the ropes of success than Harvard’s national champions?

Look at your life.
You have two exams next week. Your boyfriend just broke up with you because he didn’t like that lipstick that you use (but really because you know that that he’s eying that girl in his “Justice” section). Your friends think you’re an alcoholic.
Now look to the person to the next on you. He’s on Facebook—and he does not care about your plight (or so says a recent Harvard study).
Basically, people who use the internet are inconsiderate, according to a study conducted by Harvard professor Howard E. Gardner '65. After all, did you think about the musician and the product he created when you decided to torrent all his music? This question is one asked by Carrie James, Research Director at the Harvard School of Education, in a presentation she made on Tuesday at The Mashable & 92Y Social Good Summit 2010.
In the presentation, which can be viewed at Mashable.com, James calls on the wasteful and digitally-addicted youth “move on beyond clicks onto deep, social issues.” She warns of a "scarcity of ethical thinking"—what she defines as the capacity to think disinterestedly—online.
James did say that there is a constructive presence online, using the example of Wikipedia.org, which she recognized as a place of knowledge creation.
"But with great power, comes great responsibility," James said, explicitly quoting "Spiderman."
(Because Spiderman totally followed Uncle Ben's advice directly after when he said that.)

The FDR suite—the room where Franklin D. Roosevelt, class of 1904, lived—was recently renovated and restored by The FDR Suite Foundation. To commemorate the restoration, the Harvard Alumni Association offered a tour today called “Presidential Pathways: Tracing TR and FDR at Harvard,” guided by Foundation President Michael D. Weishan ’86.
Naturally, we decided to take a look.
After getting a quick peek at where the apartment of Theodore Roosevelt, class of 1880, was located (which actually was where the Malkin Athletic Center is now), the tour took us to room B-17 of Adams House in Westmorly Court—the famous FDR suite.
Roosevelt's suite was equipped with all the latest innovations of his time, including central heat, electricity, and a modern “hygienic” bathroom. With over 600 square feet of living space spread over four rooms, the suite, which boasted luxuries such as a working fireplace, cost him $500 per year during a time when tuition was only $150 per year.
“Westmorly Court was the place to live, if you could—and FDR enjoyed living quite the life," Weishan said.
Weishan said that the rooms are slowly being filled with furniture reminiscent of the era when Roosevelt, the former U.S. president who also was president of The Crimson, lived in order to create "the only existing memorial to the former President at Harvard, as well as a living museum of daily college life at the turn of the 20th century."
Adams House Master John G. "Sean" Palfrey '67, who is also the great-grandson of Theodore Roosevelt, said that this renovation is less for Adams House than it is for the whole academic community, “though it's fun to have it here, and it has been a very interesting project for many of us personally.”
“Our hope is that we can educate generations of students about FDR, about the history of Adams House, Westmorely Hall and the Gold Coast, and Cambridge and Harvard in that era," he said.
The FDR Suite Foundation and the Palfreys will eventually allow the suite to be rented at $150 a night. The official opening with University President Drew G. Faust, the honorary chair of The FDR Suite Foundation, will be in February.

Harvard isn’t exactly known to be a community of slackers, but one recent Harvard graduate might have set the bar a little bit higher: he’s only 25, and when he’s not attending class at the Harvard Business School, he’s busy investing in 15 start-up companies.
Oh, and did we mention he already has a million-dollar start-up of his own?
Joshua Kushner ’08 started Vostu.com in his junior year along with Daniel E. Kafie ’05 and Mario T. Schlosser. Vostu, an online gaming site with a social-networking spin, now has 35 million registered users, 180 employees, and 15 million dollars in support from Intel and General Catalyst, according to a recent profile of Kushner in Business Insider.
Kushner’s past endeavors share a common theme: an interest in networking and social interaction in the Internet age. He founded the Friendship Circle of Boston, a non-profit that fosters friendships between students and children with mental disabilities. Unithrive, a service he co-founded, encourages Harvard alumni to act as mentors while providing zero-interest loans to students in need.
But according to Business Insider, Kushner’s new pet project is a much bigger one—he’s already invested in fifteen start-up companies, including GroupMe, Paperless Post, Hot Potato, and Sailthru. And he hasn’t stopped there: with a $10 million fund to spend on the latest, hottest start-ups, he’s hoping to expand his portfolio further into the field of online social media.
