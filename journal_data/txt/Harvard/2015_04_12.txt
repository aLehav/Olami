After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the news that “Game of Thrones” showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would begin adapting currently unpublished material in the series’s upcoming fifth season, fans were unsure whether this decision would be to the detriment of the show and ultimately of the final two unpublished volumes of its source material. But with the season five premiere, titled “The Wars to Come,” Benioff and Weiss deftly approach the arduous process of adapting author George R.R. Martin’s lengthy fourth and fifth volumes, “A Feast for Crows” and “A Dance with Dragons.” By eliminating redundant characters and peripheral storylines, Benioff and Weiss start the season with a strong episode that maintains the previous seasons’ momentum and tightens the overall plot, without compromising the intricacy and detail of the storyline that Martin painstakingly constructs in the books.
The episode opens with a young Cersei Lannister visiting a fortune teller named Maggy the Frog, a scene only alluded to in flashbacks in “Feast.” It’s a disturbing moment that foreshadows the paranoia and growing insanity that adult Cersei (Lena Headey) experiences after the deaths both of her son Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) and of her father Tywin (Charles Dance). As she mourns the murder of her father, Cersei also faces the emergence of the Sparrows, a fanatic religious cult that will threaten to undermine her authority in King’s Landing.
Meanwhile in Meereen, Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) must confront a similar yet more insidious group, the Sons of the Harpy, who have begun to wage a guerilla war against her army of Unsullied in the streets of the city. It’s in these scenes that “Game of Thrones” begins to suffer from the same growing pains as “The Walking Dead”—both are shows that built a significant following from their surprising deaths of main characters. However, after five seasons, it is clear that certain characters are exempt from this fate. Coming from a show that has previously used the tagline “All men must die” (the Valyrian phrase “Valar morghulis” in the books), it is disappointing when serious dramatic tension is replaced by the gruesome murder of random redshirt characters who are not important to the plot.
Interestingly, the show does depart from the book in several significant ways or otherwise accelerates existing storylines. The premiere episode shows Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), having arrived in Pentos with the help of Varys (Conleth Hill), immediately traveling towards Meereen to support Daenerys—a plot that highly accelerates his storyline. Furthermore, Benioff and Weiss continue to explore the uneventful adventures of Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) and Pod (Daniel Portman), a storyline that is intricately entangled with Lady Stoneheart and the Brotherhood Without Banners—elements that have taken second fiddle or are nonexistent in the show.
Whether the fifth season of “Game of Thrones” will reveal important new plot revelations has yet to be seen. But until Martin finishes “The Winds of Winter,” this season, with all of its small divergences and modifications, shall suffice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 12, 2015, at 5:00 p.m.
Former Massachusetts Governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney spoke about the importance of experience in the private sector, the 2016 presidential campaign, and his time as a student at Harvard Law School during a public question and answer session at the Law School Friday.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow joined Romney on stage and questioned him on topics ranging from modern-day political polarization to finding a work-life balance. She later handed the microphone over to members of the crowd in a packed Milstein East Hall.
Romney graduated from the Law School in 1975 and Harvard Business School in 1974.
Discussing his own career and path to public service, Romney emphasized the value of experience in the private sector.
“It is not that hard to move from the private sector to the public sector,” he said. “It’s probably harder to go the other way, but in the private sector the experience you have...that skill, that knowledge can be translatable into the governmental sector quite easily, and you can make a real contribution coming in with perspective skills that many of the people there don’t have, because they haven’t been in the private sector.”
Romney also reflected on his experience as a student at the Law School. He said that he had worried he would not do well at the school, but maintained that his Harvard education proved valuable during his wide-ranging career in public and private service.
“I don’t know that Harvard Law School is the place to give you, if you will, a textbook of law that you can then follow through your career. It is instead an approach to finding answers to difficult issues, whether legal or business in nature, that has helped me most in my career,” Romney said.
“Thank you for that,” Minow said.
Romney also discussed the field for the 2016 presidential campaign, in particular the candidates for the Republican nomination. Romney, who has run for president twice before in the Republican party, reportedly considered a third attempt for the White House, but ultimately decided not to run again.
When asked what advice he has for candidates running in 2016 in the Republican party, Romney said he has cautioned candidates in their approach to policy questions.
“A number of them have been kind enough to either come by and see me or give me a call, and ask me that question,” he said. “And I’ve talked to them about policies. One of the things I’ve mentioned to them... [is] be very careful in the policies you adopt so they cannot be demagogued into saying ‘we’re the party of the rich.’ We know that’s what they’re going to hit us with, whoever our nominee is.”
Later in the discussion, Romney referred to the controversy over the tax rate he paid during the presidential campaign. He said that his tax rate “was as low as I possibly could make it,” adding, “Anyone who pays more taxes than they are legally required to pay probably should be disqualified” to laughter from the crowd.
Though Romney said the hardest part of the campaign was losing, he still said he recommends the race, calling it an “exhilarating experience.”
“If you get the chance to run for president, do it. It’s great,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin Steinberg, a New York public defender who was initially disinvited in February as an honoree of a separate Law School event, addressed her connection to a controversial online video that some say endorsed killing white police officers in retribution for police violence against black men at a Harvard Law School lecture Friday.
Delivering the Law School Criminal Justice Institute’s inaugural “Trailblazer Lecture” in Wasserstein Hall Friday, Steinberg described her experience during the public scrutiny over the video. According to a New York City investigation, Steinberg did not check the content of the video before allowing two of her employees to appear in it. Consequently, she was suspended from her role as executive director of Bronx Defenders, a low-income legal representation group contracted by New York City, for 60 days.
Initially listed as an honoree as part of the International Women’s Day photo exhibit at the Law School, Steinberg’s invitation was rescinded on account of the investigation, according to a joint press release from the Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development Society, the organizations that organized the exhibit.
While Steinberg said during the lecture Friday that the video at the heart of the controversy was largely misconstrued and its message distorted, she said that if her organization had been given the proper chance, it would have attempted to edit the video.
“Precisely because its message is so vulnerable to misinterpretation, we would have insisted on editing out those portions of the video that threatened even imagined violence against the police,” she said. “Not because they are not legitimate avenues of expression, but because we would have known that those images would offend and tragically distract from the real issue: that of our clients’ experiences that we were trying to shine a light on.”
Steinberg said that her experience with the investigation has given her insight into her work.
“It has only been in the terrifying and wild country of being a target myself that I have understood the depths of client need,” she said. “The paralyzing stress of daily fear and the abject loneliness that comes from being unheard and intentionally misunderstood by those with power above you too interested in using it. It is from this outcast state, my outcast state, that I fully intend to blaze a trail forward.”
The decision to revoke Steinberg’s honor prompted outcry from some in the Law School community, and Professor Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., who directs the Criminal Justice Institute, said it was “a very unfortunate episode that occurred [there].”
“I certainly made it my business to ensure that her voice would be heard here at the Harvard Law School,” Sullivan said.
Steinberg said that she was thankful for the support the members of the Law School community expressed—there were a number of petitions and an op-ed in The Crimson— for her throughout the controversy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When activist group Divest Harvard was founded in 2012, the group had a clear mission: to push the University to direct its investments out of fossil fuel companies. By doing so, members argued, Harvard could sway popular opinion against these companies and have a strong influence in combating climate change.
That message, though, has not resonated with administrators. University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly argued against divesting Harvard’s $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels, maintaining that it will instead address climate change through other avenues, particularly research initiatives. In an interview last month, Faust characterized divestment as a “dangerous and ineffective tool.”
“I think we are a community that is committed to the rule of reason and argument and discussion,” Faust said that day. “And that not having your way...as a result of a discussion or an interchange is not foundation for a legitimate seizure of a space or building in which you don't belong.”
Faust’s refusal to change Harvard’s investment practices has frustrated Divest Harvard, and so has her characterization of the group’s strategy.
“The administration has consistently ostracized Divest Harvard and used ever-changing statements about why they’re not divesting,” Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 said on Saturday. “We're actually not that radical. We’re not insane. We’re genuinely frightened for our futures and truly believe that Harvard is sponsoring some of that fear.”
Beginning on Sunday, Divest Harvard plans to stage its most ambitious act yet, hoping to bring hundreds of students, faculty, and alumni to Harvard Yard to blockade Massachusetts Hall for “Heat Week,” which will run until April 17. Hundreds of protesters say they are willing to be arrested, according to Maxmin. This escalation is the product of the group’s disillusionment with an administration that they claim has not seemed willing to meaningfully engage with them or take the action they think is necessary.
“All of us are tired; we are exhausted from fighting this University,” Maxmin said. “We barely sleep at night, we wake up in the morning to the sounds of our phones texting because we’re constantly talking about this.”
Originally, the group sought dialogue with Faust about goals for divestment. They went to Faust’s office hours and met with representatives from the Harvard Corporation in off-the-record meetings. Some members even trailed Faust through the Yard and demanded that she defend her position, all while the camera was rolling. And after Divest Harvard failed to convince Faust to hold an open meeting where anyone could ask her questions about the issue of divestment, the group escalated both in actions and in mission—Divest Harvard no longer wanted just dialogue; it demanded a full commitment to divest.
The ramping up has centered on Massachusetts Hall, which houses Faust’s office and many of her senior staffers’. Last May, the Harvard University Police Department arrested a member of Divest Harvard as the group blockaded Mass. Hall, though the student, Brett A. Roche ’15, was not charged. In February, more than 30 members of the group occupied Mass. Hall, some for a full day. Faust offered to meet with Divest Harvard members if  they left the building, but the group declined that offer.
Divest Harvard has also tried to work through the courts. Last fall, members of Divest Harvard sued the University, alleging that Harvard was violating its charter with its investments in fossil fuels, but a judge threw out the case. An appeal is in the works.
Acknowledging that their strategy has turned more aggressive, Divest Harvard members said the group has not accomplished much by trying to talk with Faust.
“The point of our civil disobedience is not just out of the blue,” said Divest Harvard co-coordinator Jasmine P. Opie ’16, who argued that the group has “spent a long time” presenting their argument.
Faust, who once skipped collegiate exams to protest in Selma, Ala., sees no room for Divest Harvard’s blockade plans on Harvard’s campus.
“Peaceful protest is absolutely a part of our campus and they have every right to peacefully protest. They don't have the right to stop University business,” Faust said in March.
Still, Divest Harvard appears poised to plow forward. Administrators have started preparing for the disruption they anticipate will come with the planned blockade. In an email to students Friday, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde addressed “Heat Week,” recommending that students allow themselves extra time to walk to class and asking that they “exercise caution” in allowing non-Harvard affiliates access to campus buildings during the protest.
