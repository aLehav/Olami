After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 26, 2018 at 3:37 p.m.
“West Cork” is a podcast released by Audible, Amazon’s audiobook and podcast distributor, in which Jennifer Forde and Sam Bungey delve into the murder of Sophie Tuscan du Plantier, which took place in 1996 and remains unsolved. Within the first five episodes, this true-crime series paints a complex picture of a quiet town shaken by a violent act. It investigates a murder which, despite being more than 20 years in the past, represents a real source of fear and even danger for the residents of this Irish town.
The podcast’s title “West Cork” could just as easily be the name of a detective novel as a non-fiction podcast, and the subheading—“Every countryside has its dark side”— could have been pulled from a dust-jacket. In fact, the story itself is the kind one might expect to find in a murder mystery novel, and less so in real life. Its first episode, entitled “Blowins,” portrays West Cork, a quiet town in Ireland isolated from the rest of society. “Blowins” is the label that non-residents give to those who vacation in West Cork, looking for an escape from city life. They come out of nowhere, and people know nothing about their pasts.
“You could be who you wanted to be rather than who you really were,” says one of the so-called “blowins.” This sort of setting, where every person is a mystery, seems almost too fitting for a murder mystery to be true—like something straight out of Agatha Christie’s “And Then There Were None,” a classic murder mystery in which a group of strangers, trapped on a completely isolated island, are killed off one by one. In discussion with Forde and Bungey, another resident says about West Cork, "It's very quiet in the winter. People who don’t know that yet were going to have to keep themselves very busy somehow or they’ll go mad," a comment that recalls Stephen King’s “The Shining,” with its isolated wintry setting where a father descends slowly into insanity.
The podcast itself seems to be aware of this case’s semblance of fiction and literature. In the first episode, Forde describes a group of elderly women who have come to observe the trial.  "They’d arrived equipped with flasks of tea and a selection of neatly cut sandwiches," Forde explained. According to Forde, the women have a club of sorts that follows the trial's progress, and they made sure that one of them attended the court proceedings each day. This group’s similarity to a book club seems too calculated to be unintentional. The ratings for the televised reporting on the case are likened to those of TV soaps. Later on, another comparison to fiction emerges from a conversation with a local in a bar. "Did you ever see the film ’Deliverance?’ Well that's all I’m gonna say to you. You don't go down there and mess with their town," the man tells Forde and Bungey.
But it is equally clear that this story is not fiction, and its forceful reality makes the story all the more unnerving and disturbing. It is the type of murder mystery that is enjoyable to read on a rainy day—terrifying yet safe because of its clear fiction—brought to life. The podcast is the perfect medium for conveying that reality—there is nothing false about it. Were this a film or a television series, actors would likely be hired and characters created who, while linked to the real people involved, would still be distinct, separate people, introducing a fictional aspect to the piece through their acting. Were this to be a written piece, the narration and description would leave more up to the imagination of the reader. In this form, the people directly involved in the murder are a part of its depiction and the story’s creation. Their real voices are used, and they share their unscripted thoughts and reactions.
In classic murder-mystery form, the primary suspect is revealed to be a character who has already been introduced, and one who is not immediately obviously untrustworthy. But unlike in a murder mystery, he is a real person. His voice is a consistent presence on the podcast, narrating details and addressing listeners directly. In fact, according to Forde, “Speaking with [the suspect] became a regular part of [their] lives for a while.”
Even the background sounds of the podcast, which add to the unsettling and suspenseful feel, are anchored in reality. The music is subtle yet oddly terrifying. The fourth episode opens with unnerving, high-pitched screams which overlap and fill the air. At first, it was easy to believe that these screams were created in a studio by the producers for dramatic effect. But as the episode progresses it becomes clear that they are in fact from a recording of an annual tradition in which West Cork residents swim in an icy lake in cold weather. Some of the people most deeply involved with the case were in attendance and interviewed. In other words, even this detail is very, very real.
This kind of attention to detail is what sets “West Cork” apart. Its story is far from unique, and perhaps even notable for the impressive number of clichés it includes. But it carefully and constantly reminds listeners that these clichés are not merely boring motifs to be written off. They are based in reality and in this case, they have been played out fully in a way that is bloody, mysterious, and all-too real.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—A packed home crowd of 6,586. Twenty lead changes. A one-possession final score margin that was reflective of much of the contest. The victors? Penn, 74-71.
The Harvard men’s basketball team was unable to climb back from a late-game hole and relinquished its first place share of the Ivy League on Saturday night at the Palestra.
Up by one point with less than seven minutes to play, the Crimson (15-12, 10-2 Ivy) could not withstand a surge of momentum from the Quakers (21-7,11-1) and found itself down seven with 2:13 to play. Sophomore forward AJ Brodeur finished a second straight hook shot over Harvard sophomore Chris Lewis to bring the game to 67-60.
Despite a barrage of converted triples in the final two minutes—including two back-to-back shots from deep from sophomore forward Seth Towns—Harvard was left with just two seconds for a miracle heave down by three. Towns overshot the half-court attempt as it ricocheted off of the top of the backboard.
“Penn is a tremendous basketball team with weapons, shooters, very hard to defend,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think they were very deserving of the victory tonight and I thought their ability to score off our turnovers was probably the biggest key.”
Playing inside-out through Lewis much of the first frame, the Crimson reverted to increased perimeter play coming out of intermission. While Lewis attempted just two field goals in the second half—compared to seven shots in the prior frame—Towns stepped up in his place to carry the team late in the contest.
The Columbus, Ohio native opened the final 20 minutes of play with an isolation jumper from the right side and converted five more field goals in the frame. Towns finished the night as Amaker’s top scorer with 22 points on a 7-for-10 shooting performance.
On Penn’s senior night, it was fitting that the Quakers’ most critical shot of the game that would end up in the hands of fourth-year guard Caleb Wood. With 30 seconds remaining in the game and Penn clinging to a two-point margin, fellow senior guard Darnell Foreman bodied himself into the paint before locating Wood near the right baseline. In front of the Quakers’ bench, Wood swished the three, all but sealing the game for Penn coach Steve Donahue’s men.
“[Wood] proved he was mentally and physically tough enough to help us win games,” Donahue said. “ I think he is one of the more talented players in this league. I don’t think he gets that recognition because of what we built around him.”
After scoring just three points on Friday night at Princeton, junior wing Corey Johnson drilled four triples and saw his minutes jump from 15 to 31. Previously in a multi-game shooting slump, Johnson and his confidence from deep were positives in the defeat. As a unit, Harvard was 10-of-21 from three-point range and shot 47.2 percent from the field. In both contests against Penn, the Crimson has been able to tally at least 70 points on the score sheet.
As previously mentioned by Amaker, the one issue that Harvard faced particularly late in the game was simply maintaining possession of the basketball. After silencing a raucous crowd with an isolation jumper at the 4:47 point of the second half, Towns once again controlled the ball with his team trailing by three. Much like the final possession in regulation against Princeton Friday night, Towns lost control of the ball, resulting in a Brodeur hook shot at the other end.
Extending the lead to 67-62 entering the final minute of action, the Quakers snatched another missed pass from sophomore forward Justin Bassey, his second giveaway of the game. The Crimson subsequently fouled Foreman to force a one-and-one, and this time was not penalized for its sloppy play as Foreman’s first free throw rimmed out. Nevertheless, Penn capitalized on 22 points off of Harvard’s 14 turnovers during the game, a mark that exceeds the Crimson’s season turnover average of 13.1 giveaways per contest.
“I thought we made some silly ones and obviously their defense is really solid,” Amaker said. “We weren’t as sharp with the ball as we needed to be but you have to give them credit for putting us in positions to cough it up.”
Harvard has now lost its fourth consecutive game at the Palestra dating back to the 2015-2016 season. In speaking to the deafening roars of the Philadelphia crowd, Amaker expressed no qualms about the Ivy League Tournament being played at the historic venue in two weeks.
“It’s an honor to have a chance to compete here,” Amaker said. “I’ve always been in favor of our tournament being right here. I do feel like it’s that kind of environment.”
The Crimson’s second conference loss leaves it comfortably pinned at the No. 2 seed heading into the final weekend of the regular season. To invoke tiebreaker rules, Harvard will need at least one Penn loss in its matchups with Yale and Brown next weekend to earn a shot at finishing the regular season as conference champions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Capping off an impressive weekend at home against the Ivy League’s top two teams, Harvard women’s basketball used an electric third quarter to dominate Princeton, the top team in the Ancient Eight, to punch its ticket to the Ivy League Tournament in March.
The Crimson (16-9, 8-4 Ivy) won its last home game of the year over the Tigers (20-5, 10-2) to finish a perfect 12-0 in the newly-renovated Lavietes Pavilion.
“To be in our new gym and be undefeated in our first year is just really great,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We should thank all the donors, that’s how much we love being here.”
Harvard took real control of the driver’s seat in the third quarter. The two squads opened up the second half trading baskets before sophomore guard Katie Benzan knocked down a three off the dribble to extend the Crimson’s lead to 30-24. A few possessions later, Benzan nailed an almost identical triple.
A day after shooting one-for-nine against Penn, Benzan recovered by posting 13 points on 5-of-11 shooting. The sophomore added five rebounds in the effort.
Harvard followed up Benzan’s flurry of threes with a basket from sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm and then a transition three-pointer from junior co-captain Madeline Raster to extend the lead to 40-28, forcing a Princeton timeout. The Tigers tried to muscle the ball down low, but 5’6” guard Benzan was able to record a block and come down with a rebound over the Princeton bigs to give the Crimson possession.
Although Boehm would run into foul trouble later in quarter, freshman Jadyn Bush stepped up to record offensive rebounds on two straight possessions. Bush knocked down three free throws and a layup late in the quarter to help extend Harvard’s lead to 47-32. With under a minute to go in the third quarter, junior guard Sydney Skinner hit a three-pointer to extend the Crimson’s lead. Two late free throws from Raster made the score 52-36 entering the final period.
At the beginning of the night, however, the Tigers struck first. Starting off the game with a bang, Princeton secured the tip and netted a layup in the first three seconds of the game. Harvard was able to get on the board following a switch between Benzan and Boehm in which Boehm took advantage of the mismatch against a Tiger guard down low.
The Crimson took its first lead of the day on a three-pointer from senior guard Kirby Porter from the right wing, but Princeton quickly answered. Raster knocked down a three in the same spot, but yet again the Tigers answered with a three of its own. Harvard continued the tug-of-war first quarter after Benzan hit yet another three-pointer from the same exact spot, giving the Crimson the lead 13-11. Princeton, however, hit a triple of its own and again took the lead.
Following a Boehm layup, the Tigers hit two free throws, giving Harvard the final shot of the quarter. Skinner connected on a floater in the lane just before the buzzer to put the Crimson ahead at the first break, 17-16.
Skinner, coming off the bench, was one of the focal points of Delaney-Smith’s offense on Saturday. The junior guard poured in 16 points and tallied five assists in 27 minutes of action.
Princeton started the second quarter with a spark, knocking down two straight three-pointers to make the score 22-17. From there, the second period offense would disappear. Harvard finally got on the board in the markedly defensive quarter on a layup from senior guard Taylor Rooks with 5:47 left to play in the half. On the next trip down the court, another Rooks layup pulled the Crimson within one point.
The defensive struggle continued until a pair of Rooks free throws gave Harvard the lead with less than two minutes until halftime. After Bush tipped a pass two possessions later, junior guard Nani Redford finished on a wide open breakaway layup to give Harvard the lead, 25-22, at the break.
“I felt our defense fed our offense,” Delaney-Smith said. “This has never happened, and that’s who we wish we would be.”
The Tigers scored only six second-quarter points to the Crimson’s eight in the defensive period.
“This was the greatest defensive weekend I can remember in this gym,” Delaney-Smith said. “We got historically ten of our three [straight] stops in a ballgame, our goal is to get six in a ballgame, and we had five in the first half.”
Harvard’s defense especially clamped down on Princeton’s starters. No Tiger in the starting five accumulated more than six points, and the starters scored just 26 points collectively.
Offenses came alive quickly in the final quarter. Layups from Skinner and Bush matched two buckets from Princeton. A triple from the Tigers would pull Princeton within 13 points, but Skinner would match with a three of her own to make the score 59-43.
Following a controversial travel call on Bush, Rooks knocked down a three-pointer from the top of the key to extend the Crimson’s lead even further. Princeton answered with a triple of its own, but Benzan quickly converted on a layup on the other end.
With just under four minutes to go in the contest, Benzan swiped the ball away in the Tigers’ backcourt and found Skinner, assisting on the latter’s three-pointer to put Harvard up 67-48.
“We played such good defense and we let that influence how we played on offense,” Raster said. “We brought a ton of energy on defense and got a ton of stops and that flowed into the offensive end, so even when we weren’t shooting well we were still able to play strong defense. That’s something we’ve struggled with this season so it was good to figure that out and play so tough on defense.”
The Crimson cruised for the final few minutes, dribbling out the clock to secure a 72-58 victory, clinching its sport in Philadelphia for the Ivy League tournament.
“We’re just excited to keep playing, anytime you can extend your season it’s so awesome,” Raster said. “We feel like we have a lot of momentum going into next weekend and then the tournament, so I think we’re really excited to show up and play hard like we did this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Revenge is sweet. For No. 24 Harvard men’s swimming and diving, there may have been none sweeter in recent years.
The Crimson has not beaten Princeton at the Tigers’ home pool since 2000. Over that same stretch, Harvard has dropped 15 dual meets, and eight of those losses were to Princeton.
Perhaps most relevantly, it was Princeton (7-4, 5-2 Ivy League) who snatched the 2016 Ancient Eight championship away from the Crimson (9-0, 6-0), winning the final event to beat Harvard by just 21.5 points. Harvard has not forgotten.
“I think the pain of that loss to Princeton always stuck with my class,” senior Koya Osada said. “We had a goal of not letting the same thing happen again.”
The Crimson took no chances in making sure that history didn’t repeat itself at this year’s championship meet, held this week at DeNunzio Pool in Princeton, N.J. Harvard led from the first event and eclipsed the rest of the Ivy League to capture the Ancient Eight crown for the second year in a row and the 25th time overall. The Crimson posted 1,630.5 points en route to the victory, nearly 350 more than the second-place Tigers.
“It was such an incredible experience winning the Ivy Championship title with this team,” sophomore Daniel Chang said. “We worked so hard towards this goal and it was so amazing to see it all pay off for us.”
Osada was in a similarly awe-struck mood after the triumph.
“It feels surreal, and I'm so incredibly proud of our team for fighting the way that they did,” he added. “It was a true team effort from start to finish and I can't describe in words how happy I am.”
Harvard cruised to the win on strong performances from the entire team. In total, 10 Crimson swimmers picked up victories, while two more finished on the podium at least once.
Beyond the all-around solid effort, a few members of the team had particularly impressive meets. Harvard won 12 events, and sophomore Dean Farris and junior Brennan Novak accounted for 10 of those victories. Both swimmers won every event in which they competed, and between them they set five new program, pool, and Ivy League records.
For their efforts, both Farris and Novak were presented with the Phil Moriarty Award, given to the meet’s most elite swimmer. This is the second year in a row that Farris has earned the award.
Last time around, the Atlanta, Ga., native set a new program, pool, and meet record in the 200-yard freestyle, posting a time of 1:31.56. This year, Farris smashed his own mark, touching the wall in 1:31.12. Just like last season, the sophomore’s time is the fastest in the nation for this year, and once again it’s a new best for Harvard, DeNunzio Pool, and the Ivy League championship.
Farris’ record mark in the 200 freestyle, though, was just one of many personal feats this week. The sophomore also eclipsed Ancient Eight records in the 100 and 200 backstroke events. Junior Daniel Tran was third in the 200 backstroke, and Osada took fifth place in the event.
“Dean's performances throughout the meet have shown that he's capitalizing on the foundation he laid during his freshman year and is now developing as an incredibly versatile swimmer,” co-captain Luke Morgan-Scott said. “We all knew that he was going to go faster this year, but his swims in the 100 and 200 backstroke are making him a triple threat for NCAAs.”
While Farris dominated the 200 free, Novak had a similarly commanding showing in the distance freestyle events. The junior swept the 500, 1,000, and 1,650 freestyle races while establishing new program, pool, and meet records in the former two. Junior Logan Houck was close behind, taking third in the 500 and nabbing silver in both the 1,000 and the 1,650.
Novak and Farris also teamed up for the 800 freestyle relay and surpassed yet another record, topping the former fastest mark by half a second, along with freshman Mahlon Reihman and sophomore Zach Snyder.
The win was reflective of the Crimson’s absolute dominance in the relay throughout the contest. Harvard took top marks in all five relay events, setting five new program records and four new pool- and meet-best times along the way.
The Crimson began the meet with a relay victory, as the lineup of Farris, junior Sebastian Lutz, and seniors Steven Tan and Paul O’Hara won with an Ancient Eight record-time of 1:24.52 in the 200 medley relay. Tan and O’Hara would combine with sophomore Raphael Marcoux and senior Ed Kim the next night to win the 200-yard freestyle relay.
The duo of Tan and Farris also joined up with Marcoux and Chang in the 400-yard medley relay, touching the wall three seconds ahead of the Tigers to smash another program and meet record. The pair would go on to close out the meet with a final relay win and a fourth record time, earning the gold medal in the 400 freestyle relay along with Kim and O’Hara.
Tan also won the 100-yard butterfly with a mark of 46.21, the second-fastest time in program history. The senior took second place in the 50-yard freestyle as well.
Elsewhere, Chang helped cement the win with a silver medal finish in the 100-yard breaststroke, beating out the third-place finisher from Yale by eight-tenths of a second. Kim collected a solo podium finish of his own in the 100-yard freestyle, ending up in second.
On the boards, Columbia captured two of the top three spots in both the one-meter and three-meter dives. Co-captain Bobby Ross was Harvard’s highest finisher, taking fourth place in both events.
Running away with the outright Ivy League championship is a fitting send-off for a senior class that has amassed a dual-meet record of 36-1, completed three undefeated regular seasons and the same number of dual-campaign Ancient Eight titles, and captured the conference title once before. The team is not finished for the year, though, with the NCAA championships coming up in March.
“I'd be lying if I said that we weren't trying to take down Princeton at their home pool and bring back the Ivy League title,” Morgan-Scott said. “That being said, we've also started to think about the transition of trying to push more towards the national level. With the help of some great individual and relay swims this past weekend I think we're on our way there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team (13-16-2, 10-10-2 ECAC) saw its season come to an end versus No. 4 Colgate (31-4-1, 19-3-0 ECAC) in the ECAC Quarterfinals on Saturday, dropping the first and second games of the best-of-three series. The Crimson fell to the Raiders by a score of 6-4 on Friday before losing game two by a score of 6-1 on Saturday.
“It’s always hard to say goodbye to your seniors, knowing that they’re never going to put that jersey on again,” said freshman forward Becca Gilmore. “But it’s exciting what this team did this year. We have a lot of big goals for next year, and it’s going to be a fun year.”
COLGATE 6, HARVARD 4
Fans were treated to a 10-goal thriller on Friday night in the opening game of the playoff series. The goals came early and often, with the Raiders’ Breanne Wilson-Bennett finding the net in under a minute to get the contest off to a quick start.
Colgate added a pair of scores before the end of the first period to bring the score to 3-0, but the Crimson was not deterred. Harvard managed to fight back to within a goal by the middle of the third period, thanks to power play efforts from senior defenseman Chelsea Ziadie and Gilmore. Ziadie logged her team-best third power play goal of the season, and Gilmore finished the night with two goals.
Gilmore’s classmate, forward Keely Moy, also got on the board for the Crimson, finding the net following a pass from junior Kate Hallett midway through the third frame. With 8:48 to play, the goal put the Crimson within one, and a memorable comeback looked as if it were developing.
Harvard’s resilience when down was ultimately not enough to topple the formidable Raiders, who scored shortly after the Crimson’s fourth tally to increase their lead to 6-4. Impressive puck movement in a 5-on-3 situation topped off by a quick reaction from Chelsea Jacques gave Colgate its second power play goal of the night and effectively killed off Harvard’s chances of taking the series’ first game.
Sophomore goaltender Beth Larcom had a busy night, racking up 37 saves on the Raiders’ 43 shots on goal. Both teams converted twice on the man advantage, with the Crimson going 2-4 compared to Colgate’s 2-7.
COLGATE 6, HARVARD 1
A second high-scoring game of the weekend shut the door once and for all on Harvard’s season, as the squad fell 6-1 to Colgate on Saturday night to conclude its 2017-2018 campaign.
The Raiders opened the scoring in the first period again, this time on a power play through Jessie Eldridge, who was able to beat Larcom from close range 7:20 into the tilt. The Crimson was quicker in responding this time, as freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich equalized just 41 seconds later.
Otherwise, the teams held one another in check through the first frame, but it didn’t take long into the second period before Colgate got on the board again. At 0:40 of the second period, the Raiders regained their lead and held onto it for the remainder of the game. Eldridge added her second goal of the night before the end of second and finished on an empty Crimson net in the third to seal her hat trick.
Harvard fought throughout the game, registering 32 shots on goal compared to Colgate’s 36. The Crimson went 0-5 on power plays, however while the opposition converted one of its three power play opportunities on the night.
The Raiders will continue on to the ECAC semifinals, where they will play No. 5 Cornell. Harvard bows out of the tournament and will have to wait until next year for a shot at ECAC glory.
“Obviously it’s a horrible feeling when your season ends, but I’m truly so, so proud of this group,” sophomore Kat Hughes said. “I think that throughout the year, every single day we got better and we got closer through all the losses and ups and downs. We stuck together. I think it was a crucial year for our program, and we really set the pace for how we want to improve in the next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the fickle New England weather reverted back to the typical blustery, cold winter conditions, the Harvard softball team traveled to sunny Orlando, Fla., for the Citrus Classic. After winning its first two games on Friday, the Crimson dropped the final three to begin its season with a 2-3 record.
The level of Harvard’s competition increased significantly as the tournament progressed. On Saturday, the Crimson faced off against No. 23 Kentucky, and on Sunday it took on Louisville, which was last season’s 60th-ranked team in the nation by RPI.
“I think coming down here we all knew this tournament was going to be challenging,” junior lefthander Katie Duncan said. “It was going to push us, especially because it was our first time out, but we were really excited for the challenge.”
Duncan served as Harvard’s workhorse over the weekend, throwing 23.2 innings and making appearances in all five games, four of which she started. Duncan is far and away the most experienced hurler on the roster, as there are no senior pitchers, classmate Sarah Smith missed time with injury, and the rest of the rotation is comprised of sophomores.
“We would love to have our bullpen, and we know our pitchers are working to get to that point, but having Katie throw so many innings and be consistent was huge for us, and we’re really hoping she can maintain that throughout the season,” junior third baseman Erin Lockhart said.
LOUISVILLE 4, HARVARD 3
Through six and a half innings on Sunday morning, it appeared as though the Crimson would fly back to Cambridge with three wins on the weekend. However, a last-ditch rally for the Cardinals (10-4) was too much for Harvard to handle.
The Crimson entered the bottom of the seventh clinging to a 3-2 lead with sophomore Olivia Giaquinto in the circle. Giaquinto hit the first batter she faced, and coach Jenny Allard opted to bring starter Duncan back into the fold. A sacrifice bunt and an error put runners on the corners with one out for Louisville. Duncan hit Blaire Bass to load the bases, but she answered by striking out the next batter.
One more out and Harvard would go home with three wins. One more baserunner, and the Cardinals would force extra innings.
It turned out that Louisville got that baserunner and didn’t stop there. Caitlin Ferguson and Jamie Soles drew a pair of walks, and Maddy Newman crossed the plate as the winning run.
For the second consecutive game, the Crimson posted just four hits. Junior shortstop Rhianna Rich was responsible for half of those—a single and a double.
KENTUCKY 9, HARVARD 3
Harvard hung with Kentucky (9-3), ranked 23rd in the NCAA, through five and a half innings. However, the Wildcats used two huge offensive frames and shutdown pitching in the second half of the game to pull away from the Crimson.
When Harvard took the field in the bottom of the sixth, it trailed by just two runs, 5-3. However, by the time the Crimson recorded the third out, Kentucky had padded its lead with four more runs. Six hits, five of which were singles, allowed the Wildcats to circle the bases until Duncan re-entered the game in relief to strike out the final batter of the inning.
Earlier, Harvard held a 3-1 lead at the midpoint of the game. The Crimson jumped out to a two-run lead in the top of the first on the strength of a Meagan Lantz double and a Lockhart sacrifice fly. Junior co-captain Kaitlyn Schiffhauer plated Harvard’s third run in the top of the fourth with a double to center field.
Kentucky out-hit Harvard, 13-3, but the visitors managed to hang with the Wildcats by killing rallies and taking advantage of its own offensive opportunities. Kentucky stranded nine runners to the Crimson’s four.
DUKE 5, HARVARD 0
After scoring 11 runs on Friday night, Harvard’s offense went quiet in its first action on Saturday. Duke (9-5), a first-year program at the Division I level, posted its fourth shutout in 14 games.
Blue Devils righthander Katherine Huey got the start and tossed four shutout innings. Peyton St. George followed up with three scoreless innings of her own to secure the combined shutout. Each pitcher has a season ERA under 2.00.
The Crimson’s offense was capped at just four hits, none of which went for extra bases, and one walk. Harvard only struck out three times, but Duke played a clean game in the field between its duo of pitchers.
“I think Saturday we definitely saw some better pitching and some better defensive teams, and they were also making some pretty good plays on us,” Lockhart said.
HARVARD 11, MIAMI (OH) 8
In a high-scoring affair, the Crimson advanced to 2-0 in the Citrus Classic. Every player in the starting lineup reached base at least once.
Twice, Miami (3-6) put up a fight after facing large deficits. In the top of the fifth, trailing 9-4, the Redhawks plated four runs to slash Harvard’s advantage. Miami managed just one hit in this inning but took advantage of control issues from the Crimson’s bullpen. One inning earlier, the Redhawks were down three runs but pulled within one on the strength of an RBI single and an RBI double.
Duncan stymied Miami’s multiple comeback attempts by finishing out the game with 2.1 innings of shutout ball.
Lantz and freshman Morgan Melito each collected three hits, and Lockhart went two-for-three with her first home run of the season.
This game was one of firsts for a pair of Harvard players. On the first pitch of her first collegiate at-bat, freshman outfielder Alyssa Saldana hit a home run. Joining the club in the bottom of the sixth, sophomore catcher Lindey Kneib recorded her first career homer.
“All three of the freshmen did a great job stepping up and contributing in big roles,” Duncan said. “All in all, the freshmen have really added the depth that the team needed and have contributed immediately, not only on the field but also in the dugout, being positive, upbeat and really into the game, cheering everybody on.”
HARVARD 4, PURDUE 3
The Crimson opened its 2018 campaign with a close victory over Purdue (2-11). Duncan tossed six innings without conceding an earned run, striking out three in the process.
After five relatively quiet offensive innings, a flurry of runs in the sixth and seventh gave Harvard the victory. In the top of the sixth, Rich knotted the score at two with an RBI double, and her double play partner Lantz drove her in with an opposite-field base hit.
The Crimson extended its lead to 4-2 in the top of the seventh and needed just three outs to start its tournament with a win. However, Purdue put runners on the corners with no outs to start the bottom half of the frame. Duncan returned to the mound in Alissa Hiener’s stead, but the Boilermakers’ Stephanie Ramsey ripped a single into left field to cut Harvard’s lead to one.
Before Purdue could continue its comeback bid, however, Duncan regrouped. The junior struck out Alexa Binckes and induced a double play to shut down the Boilermakers’ effort.
On the offensive end, a trio of juniors set the tone. Rich, Lantz, and junior catcher Elizabeth Shively combined for seven hits, three runs scored, and three runs batted in.

Blocking season is coming in hot, and everyone’s scrambling to find a group. Gossip-worthy arguments unfold, middle school drama is repeated, and unjustified tears are shed. There are undoubtedly some true “squads,” but not every group is created so tight-knit. You may have noticed some surprising group combinations over the past few weeks.
Dubbed the "Franken-Squad," this group is made up of people who’re really not that tight, but don’t want to be floaters. Not sure if you’re part of one or not? Take a look at this Flyby-approved checklist to see if you are.
Polite Convo
If you find yourself engaging in pleasantries with your blocking group a lot, you’re in some deep water. Talking excessively about “that hard p-set last week” and complaining about Berg food at the Berg as the main topics of discussion indicate a lack of spark in the group.
Excursions
If your squad hasn't explored the city together—and we’re talking about more than a trip to El Jefe’s—and made some good memories, you clearly haven't made it out of the "Harvard Zone" characteristic of Franken-Squads.
Roast Sessions
Whether you're digging into each other or someone else you all despise, engaging in some savage roasts is always good for the camaraderie and health of the group. If you find yourself holding back, that’s never a good sign.
Late Night Talks
Who you go to with those 2 a.m. identity crises is a telltale sign of who you feel close to. If you feel a little weird dropping by your blocking group’s rooms to get some real talk, don’t be surprised when you’re not hanging out with them at all next year.
There are worse things out there than the Franken-Squad, but at least be self-aware enough to know if you're in one.
