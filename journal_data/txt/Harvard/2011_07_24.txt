The Winklevoss twins have hit another setback on their seemingly endless quest to prove they created Facebook.
On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock dismissed a lawsuit Divya K. Narendra ’04, Cameron S. H. Winklevoss ’04 and Tyler O. H. Winklevoss ’04 brought against Facebook.
In 2008, Facebook had offered them $65 million in cash and stock, but the trio continued to pursue the social networking company in court.
This suit demanded that Facebook turn over documents they claimed were suppressed during the original settlement agreement, including instant messages between the twins and former Harvard student Mark E. Zuckerberg, the Associated Press reported.
The ruling put a cap on what was a busy news week for the twins. On Tuesday, former University President Lawrence H. Summers basically called them assholes. Later that week, the twins complained about the remarks to Drew G. Faust, Harvard's current president.
Is this the last we’ll hear from the Winklevi?
Doubtful. Tyler Meade, the twins’ lawyer, said that he plans to file a motion to re-open the case.
